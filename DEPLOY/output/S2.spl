We humbly say no, trying not to laugh. "Good," he says dourly and slams the door. We giggle and Justin says, "Where is a kissing tree?" I laugh and go to him and put my arms around him and kiss him saying, Here. I found one, a kissing tree." [BL] (245 words)

They belong to the bad guy. The male robot man is there and Ellie says he should be allowed to listen to baseball games. He loves them. The bad guy says, "Well, why not?" He puts his arm around him and says, "Is that what you want?" The robot doesn't respond but Ellie insists that is what he wants. Another bad guy robot says he can't hear them, so let him read about it. Ellie insists he can hear them. She says he's audio. (NLP) I grab him and lay him down, with my legs wrapped around him in a wrestler hold and I say things and watch his eye patterns. "Yes, he is audio," I confirm. The woman robot says she wants to be pregnant. The bad guy agrees. The second bad guy robot says, "How can you do this?" The bad guy says, "It's OK, it's just hypnotist stuff." They do it and then I have them back. The robot bad guy says, "Then I have a favor to ask of you. Will you put this package in MY car? (he owns it but because he's a robot the other guy uses it) and put a nice saying with it." I put my arm around his shoulder and hug him teasingly, "You mean something sentimental and nice?" I ask. "Like "1-2-3-4, beat it, beat it." It's a joke and I laugh. [BL] (233 words)

Howard and I are in a house. I walk to a back room I haven't been paying attention to. I see a window pane is broken and a large bush is growing in through the hole. I see that someone has tried to fix the window problem. Howard comes in and wants us to talk. I groan, laughing a bit at myself and my resistance to this connection. He is gentle and coaxes me to sit beside him. I point out the broken window and say I hadn't noticed it, but obviously someone did. I was glad they did. [BL] (99 words)

Now I am at another table and am exposing the man who isn't what he says he is. Everyone is shocked to learn this. I feel bad doing this, but it is necessary. Now I go to the window and see a store and people are going in and out and then I realize it is on fire. I see some smoke in the second story. I see people still trying to go in and think that is strange they would chance going shopping in a burning building, although the fire isn't seen yet as it is still small. Then the building suddenly is gone and I am shocked. It is supposed to be there but all I see is a new street intersection. I realize I am looking at a future picture. Later I am at a table with a woman and a woman bartender talking about dreams. We are impressed with their completeness and beauty. Later out the window I see the building again. [BL] (166 words)

I lick the jelly off a yellow plastic thing and then get a bit queasy when I realize the paint is in with the jelly. I need to pee, so I go to the women's room. There are two tiny potty chairs, already being used. I go stand up over a toilet no one is supposed to use and pull the shower curtain closed around it. I pee. Delores M comes in. We chat.

I give back the car keys to my boyfriend, who isn't treating me well. He's like Ted Danson on Cheers, a womanizer. I feel some regret because now I don't have a car and will have to figure out how to get around on my own. Now his other girlfriend needs to tell him goodbye and I am encouraging her to have the courage. She struggles and hesitates. I whisper, "Come on girl, come on. You can do it." Finally she does. She tells him it's over. Now I have to lead some group in a discussion of feelings. Two men have trouble. One is trying to share his feelings and another man is belligerent and noisy and interrupts him and they get into a verbal fight. Finally I say, "That's enough, you, leave." The man defies me and then finally leaves. Then they all leave. Now I am left with cleaning up and shutting the place up myself and I hadn't done that before. I don't know how to turn down the damper on the stove to get the fire to go out and be safe. I feel overwhelmed and frustrated and a bit of a failure for not managing to keep the group together.

I am lying on a couch, dead like. I look around the room and see it is still exactly like the moment the accident happened that killed me. A plant like my angel wing begonia lies in pieces on the floor where it was knocked over. A woman picks it up and brings the stem and leaves to me and says, "Look. Part of this is still alive. But it is without care and water for so long, but if you take care of it, it will live again." I am saddened and amazed that this could be revived. I sit up, now realizing I too am alive. My parents (sort of like Grandma Mildred and Grandpa Lloyd) are in the room and I get up and walk to them. They are shocked and happy to see I am alive. I go to Grandpa "dad" and he is seated in an easy chair, and I say to him, "Don't ever do this again. You left me for dead." He apologizes and his eyes are sad as he realizes what he did. I go back and sit on the couch and look out the window. High up on the hill is a new building, the new schoolhouse. My friends are there. I wave at them and my best friend sees me and they all run down to see me, so glad I am alive again. They swarm into the house. I am excited to see them. A man is there, a boyfriend of my friend, or my boyfriend. We all hug in reunion. I go out with them to get on the bus. [BL] (272 words)

I then am lighting the candles and am dressed in a 1950's housewife, pretty for my hubby, and he walks in the door with an unexpected dinner guest. I am distressed, but handle it gently and with dignity. Later, I am cleaning up, he's now drunk and off to bed calling for me to come to bed and I am still cleaning up the sink from after the dinner.

I am at a conference, only it's in my living room. A woman comes from California and teaches. We'd had one last night and now I wake up on the couch and it's time for another one. The women come in and I sit up. The instructor is in the kitchen taking the dishes out of the dishwasher from last night as I hadn't gotten up and done them. I apologize to her, saying she doesn't have to do that. The dishes are white glass with gold trim on the edges. Bonnie had put them in because they'd been in my cupboard for so long and needed washing, from all the accumulated dust. A woman like Kathleen from poetry group sits on my right. I am telling them how the first time I used the word "abuse" to describe my upbringing felt so shocking, because it wasn't physical abuse, but emotional abuse. They were good people, but didn't know how to express themselves. Kathleen encourages me to keep calling it abuse and not cave in to society's ways of denial. I agree that I will persevere. I get up and say I need to pee and brush my teeth. There is a tiny alcove next to the living room, with a curtain as a door. I sit on a tall white bucket which sits on a toilet. I balance precariously. I pee a torrent of urine. It all rushes out of me at once. I know it can be heard by the women. Then the one man participant arrives. I immediately spill urine on the floor, it splatters from the rushing torrent. I am embarrassed. The topic f the conference is Men's Issues. I don't really want to be there, but I need the credits.

I have to pee really bad. I am in a house. Some man is injured and I am helping him. A cat is there somewhere, maybe also needing help. I go into a bathroom and try to sit on the toilet. It breaks off from the wall and is wobbly. I am standing and peeing so I won't tip it over. I pee voraciously all down my leg and around the room in front of me. I am concerned the water will back up and flow out of the toilet onto the floor. I leave. Now I am going from room to room in a hotel-like exhibit. I look out the window and see the beautiful emerald green ocean waves far below. There is a crowd of people walking through the exhibit as I am. I really need to pee and consider finding an exhibit toilet and using it. One room has a whirlpool and a single bed with an air mattress-like thing, sort of a health spa room. I wonder where people sleep and see another room with beds in it. I go out the door and go to the next exhibit room. On the way I see parrot beaded earrings and go over to see the price: 1 or 2 dollars, very cheap. I don't really want the parrots, but like crystal things or beaded things. [BL] (228 words)

I am at some campground where a conference is being held. Mary and Lucy are there. I go ahead to get us a seat at the luncheon tables, big round tables with pink tablecloths on them. I find one very close to where the speaker will be and secure a spot, saving a couple of spots for my friends. Other people are trying to sit at the table. Suddenly I realize that Deepak Chopra is sitting at the table. I see he looks ill. He has a snot booger hanging off his nose and looks bad. I say sympathetically, "You look ill." He smiles weakly. I try to help him. I offer to sort his speeches in chronological order for him. Later I go to his house with him as we'd struck up a relationship, but there aren't ramps and it is hard to get in and out. I gently chide him that he is not very sensitive to the disabled, even though he is one himself. Later I am W. talking with a couple of male friends about stuff and mention my co-worker John.

I want to attend a seminar, like the Chopra one. I line up very early to get a good seat up front. Then I am told it is being held in another spot and I go there to discover I'm a bit late and only get a spot in some other more distant section. It even requires another entrance at another field, called "Hunsaker "or something like that. I start to try and find the place to go and am told I have to take a shuttle bus thing there. As I am going to the bus stop, I tell some woman the story of how people resent people with disabilities and tell the Chopra story of the woman who said, "You have kind of an advantage, don't you?" I find a bus stop, but I'm not sure this is the right spot and I do not want to miss the bus. One comes from the wrong direction and stops and I run over to ask the driver if this is the right one or not. I nearly get hit by the bus as it pulls up to the stop. It is "articulated." He looks down at me and I can't seem to understand him, whether this is the one or not. I finally decide this is the one going to the station and go back to my spot to wait. The seminar seems so distant now. [BL] (237 words)

I am standing in a public bathroom in a health clinic place and combing my hair. I am very upset, because I scratched a sore scab and it is coming off with my hair attached (like my psoriasis of long ago) and I have bald spots. I am looking in the mirror at all the ugly black and blue bald spots and bloody lines where I've scratched them. Maybe my daughter Ellie, or someone like her, agrees to shampoo my hair and color it with dye. My hair is a dark black now. I don't know how I like that (color of June's hair). My blouse and bra are off and now two old men, gay men, get in the bathtub to do therapy together. I feel a bit uncomfortable, being so naked, but think, "Oh well, it's OK. This is a clinic." I turn and am now putting on my bra. One of the old men, now out of the tub says, "I hope she keeps the cleavage. It's great cleavage." I look into his eyes and he has on weird glasses like opera glasses inset into his eyes. I hurriedly try to get dressed. There is another room where patients are being treated, mental therapy. I am pacing. I am now a man. My friend comes in and asks where I am, even though I am pacing right past him. Other people (women) in the room laugh. I say, "Vagina," and a man laughs archly, "Aha." I am upset he misunderstood me and say, "No, not that meaning. I was trying to explain about a woman being pregnant." [BL] (270 words)

I am in a living room, apparently mine and my new boyfriend and his 4-year-old son are with me. I am seated in an easy chair trying to clean up the area around me. It seems that lots of Charla's toys and junk from Ellie living there are piled up in the corner. The boy wants to play with his toys, but there is no room until I get the other stuff picked up. Now Ellie comes in and wordlessly starts picking up things. She pulls down the Christmas lights from the wall and other old decorations. It is way past Christmas. This is encouraging. I say I want to talk with her. The boyfriend realizes we need privacy and says he'll go to the other room for a while. Now Ellie and I sit side by side on another couch and I am very angry at her and I am slapping her face, only now Ellie is a tiny baby and I slap her face over and over. Now we decide to go upstairs to my bedroom for more privacy and Ellie leads the way upstairs. It is hard to walk up the stairs and the entry way is a cubby hole, not a door, which makes it physically hard to even get in. Then after we hunch down to crawl through, we have to step on a rickety ladder of sorts built up with like video or CD cassettes in a wooden rack which my boyfriend had built for me. That angers me too. Why did I choose such a difficult entryway to my own comfortable and nice room? [BL] (271 words)

Ellie comes over with Charla. She says she wants me to baby-sit her so she can go out to breakfast. She seems shy and hesitant. I think, "Well she might, after all we've been through." Ellie comes over to me, her face soft and child-like, and starts to hug me. Then she curls around me and wants to nurse, pulling my breast out of the bra. I am shocked. I say, "What are you doing?" She says something like a 4-year-old child might. She nurses. I know something is very wrong and don't know what to do. I remain calm. The sexual feeling of the nursing is beginning and I know she has regressed to some childhood place and I want to support her, but this is so odd. I can't do much other than tolerate the moment. I try to pat her and lay my arm around her, but I am not genuinely being her mother as a 4-year-old might want. I gently distract her from the nursing. It is clear now Ellie has a severe mental regression problem. Charla is clear and direct and her own energetic self. My mother calls me asking if I'd found the first aid papers yet. I say, "No, I have a real big crisis here and haven't had time to look." Ellie wraps her body around me. I say to her, "You are a 25-year-old woman, with a child. You need to act like one." Ellie doesn't seem to notice, she's so off in her own world. I know I have to have her committed. I'm not sure how to do that. [BL] (270 words)

I am in a house and there are lots of people there, a party. They are having a great time. I am on the phone talking to Archie I am trying to think of things to say to keep him talking to me. He is annoyed, in fact, angry at me. He says, angrily, "You are better than this, trying to manipulate it so we are alone. I don't like it when you do that. You know better than that." He hangs up on me. I feel terribly hurt and rejected, numbed by the pain of it. I turn and people are cheerfully calling out to me to join the party. I try to respond to them but it is very difficult. I go out to the back yard and something about Charla only having her diapers on. I see her and see she has an outfit of clothes on and looks fine. I comment that she is fine, perfectly and properly clothed. Her "mom" and "dad" want to stay at the party and I want to leave, to be alone. I tell them they can stay as long as they want. The "dad" says, "But she only has one diaper. We'll only be able to stay as long as it lasts." I shrug; not my problem. I try to leave. I feel weighted down with the sadness of Archie's rejection.

Derek kisses me. I am disappointed because his mouth is hugely wide and it doesn't feel good. He French kisses and it is intense, our tongues intricately intertwining. I feel him have an orgasm and I am untouched with sexual passion. It feels very cold and self-serving. Now I am being chased by him and other people. I run for my life. They are gaining on me and then I am backed up to a huge barbed wire fence. I turn and fight hard, without guilt. It is simply necessary to defend myself. I box kick and do karate moves. I force the fence into a man's throat, so the barbed wire is poking his throat. I demand they open the gate. It slides open enough and I dart across "no man's land," a railroad yard, tracks and mud. A "living" box car is trying to run me over as I try to race across the land and over the tracks. It moves like a cartoon creature out to get me. I cross the other fence on the other side and run like hell. The landscape is dismal and frightening. I turn left and am in a hall-like place like the storage unit place.

I am somewhere, supposedly at my place of work, only it isn't. I want to pee and try to in a bowl; it stinks and is exposed. A woman, perhaps Maren, follows me around. I am annoyed. I try to clean things up a bit, wash a dish, move a bottle to the sink. Then I go out into a large warehouse-like area and toward an open door. The woman moves ahead of me. I see the tip of a huge, black, shiny, pretty and dangerous tank. The woman steps out and is killed. I turn and walk back through the long huge warehouse building going toward the back exit. I am aware that maybe I should check and see if the woman really is dead, but that would be dangerous to me. Maybe I should warn other people, but I don't. I decide with a bit of guilt that I will call people and warn them after I get to my office, my place of work. I see cupboards and cabinets and think about hiding in one of them. I realize that is what I usually do in a dream, and decide not to do that this time. I find the back room, where two men are working, stacking wood furniture this company makes. I pass them without a word and go out the back door and around the corner. I look to the right and see the back end of the black tank which now looks like a large fuzzy black elephant, the same kind of fuzzy as my purse. I then run to the left and go up some steps to another building where my office is, only it's not my office and nobody is there and hasn't been there for a long time. [BL] (297 words)

I go find a toilet and pee a lot. Then this bathroom connects to my bedroom. I go in just as he is opening the door to the bedroom from the hall. He is standing, wearing a tank top and some leotard-like, flesh-colored outfit, like he's naked, only he's not. His legs don't move, and in fact I don't see legs. He's sort of stiff. We make love passionately. Now I go out and see Derek in a car. There are five cop cars in a line and his car is right behind them, a perfectly safe place to be. Another man is in the backseat of Derek's car and he opens the door and invites me in. I get in, happy to be alone with Derek.

Kenneth grabs the string of lights and says, "Let's try plugging them in over here." I am pleased he has the same thoughts as I do and acts upon them. Now he's hungry and wants to eat. He grabs a hamburger from a buffet bar in the center of the room and another one for Sparky. She says she doesn't want it. So he puts it back and places two sandwiches there. A fat, bald baby is sitting there and she takes a huge bite out of the sandwich. I go to her to stop her from eating Kenneth's food. Her mouth is overflowing with mayo. She's sliding off the high chair. I have a bag in my left hand and am trying to keep her from falling off the chair and keep feeding her too. I wonder why I didn't think to put down the bag so I could use both hands. Then a man is laying on the floor. His face is pudgy and bald like the baby's. He says he's joined the Marines.

Derek is painting pictures of mountains. I am trying to paint one too. I have my palette and see a sort of yellowish color up in the right hand corner, an odd color for the sky. Derek starts to dabble in my colors and I ask him not to. I then awkwardly attempt to paint. I draw a steep-peaked mountain and remember what my father said about how mountains aren't really that steep. I redraw it in softer curves. I discover how leaving some portions of the canvas blank and using that whiteness as a part of the picture enhances the picture. I create many different mountain ranges with some kind of building structure in the left corner foreground. It's pretty good. [BL] (122 words)

I see a young teen boy (maybe 17 years old) on a raft in the ocean. He and his animal friends are on a mission, like Johnny Appleseed. There is a dog, a beaver, and other animals, including 87 baby tarantulas. When he began this journey, there had been only one adult. Even though he is a virgin and doesn't know how to make love himself, his job is to find the ducks and help them have sex so they will have baby ducks. I see many little baby ducks swimming around. He helps the female ducks sit on the male duck in the right position so the deed gets done. I know this because a male narrator voice is telling these facts as I see the picture. Now the scene changes and I am talking to a woman. She confesses she had another baby boy after Melvin. Although the woman would be Valerie, logically, it is Ginny. I now get to meet the long lost boy, who is an innocent young teen (as above). He has bright red hair. His name is Douglas. I say, "It's so nice to meet Melvin's half brother." He looks surprised and says, "Half"? I look over at Ginny. "Haven't you told him?" "Sorry." So they talk. I say to him, "I am called Auntie. I am like your Auntie." He formally says, "Hello, Auntie."

Now I decide to move to Mapleton. I am biking down the old highway and see a lovely stretch of grass and decide to bike across the "moors" for fun. It's very pretty and pastoral. Now I am in town and finish my errand and am biking back to my new home. My front wheel keeps getting caught in the old grooves of the asphalt and it pulls me a bit, so I struggle to keep on the road. I manage. I cross a bridge. I see I have a long way to go, maybe eight miles. I hope I get home before dark. I'll be tired, but oh well, it's a pretty ride and an adventure. I am munching on carrot sticks. As I approach a railroad crossing, the red lights come on. I know I'm supposed to stop, but I don't. I slow down and look and then scoot across anyway. At the last track to cross I look up and realize the train is almost upon me. I get across and then see the crossing guard bar.

Now I am a woman and I walk up to a seated Indian man, who is wearing an 1890's kind of black jacket, like Wyatt Earp would have worn, white man's clothes. He's the foreman. He calls out the black woman I will have as a slave. He hands me the white, little plastic bag which has her documents in it. It's her "freedom" bag. I take it and hand it to her. I say, "Elizabeth. I give you your freedom." She doesn't understand. She thinks I'm firing her and she'll be alone and poor. I say to her, "You are your own woman now and I'd like to hire you. I will pay $6 a week." The Indian man shows me a picture. It has a bright spotlight in the center and a sidelight where he's standing. He says, "I'm in the side light because I'm an Indian. I've always wanted to be in the center spotlight." I say to him, "I understand. Believe it or not, I am in the sidelight too, because I'm a woman with a disability. We get the same kind of discrimination." [BL] (239 words)

I am talking to a man about how crazy making it is to work in crowded conditions. I tell him about registration at the community college and how each year it got more crowded. I see Tyler telling Charlene one of his stories and smile because I know she has heard it many times. I wonder if she will just stoically listen or what. She finally interrupts him and says she has heard it before. She leaves and he smiles sheepishly. Now the man comes into my bedroom. I think I am rooming in his house. His son is upstairs. He is a quad and the man is crying as he tells me that today the assistant can't come today and he will have to be left alone. I offer to call in sick at work and stay to help him, but it would mean moving him downstairs and I couldn't transfer him. The man is grateful. [BL] (157 words)

I, the dreamer, is watching a scene. I seem to identify with the married man. A woman and a man get married after a short, but loving, courtship. Soon after they are married, they begin to have misunderstandings and fights. They are always angry at each other and can't seem to reconcile it. They are miserable, yet they love each other. There is another man, an architect, who loves the woman and she goes to visit him. The jealous husband, who has another kind of career, follows her and comes into the house. The two men talk. The husband is angry and belligerent, but after a while the other man begins to understand that the husband is a good man, but hurt. So he helps the husband understand, and brings the woman and the husband back together, even though he still loves her. But now he is best friends with the husband and cares as much for him. The husband and the woman go out to the car to drive home when the woman's parents come to get in the back seat. They are argumentative and negative at the husband, who in his new-found understanding, doesn't tolerate it anymore. He tells them to shut up. The woman at first is upset and then understands that is right. She smiles at the husband. [BL] (222 words)

A rather stupid, lanky man is asking me questions. I hold a package with a small plastic bag of white beads in it. It is a beading kit. He asks me what the words on the package says. I say, "Stretched string beads." He asks how many beads there are. Are there enough to bead a whole shirt? I answer gruffly, "How would I know? It doesn't say." I am annoyed with his attitude and questions. The man says, "Why don't you lighten up?" I realize I am being sharp and grumpy, but I say, "Because I don't want to," which is true. This IS the way I feel and I don't want to change it right now. [BL] (118 words)

I am in the M City house, sleeping in my bedroom. I open my eyes and see my "dad" walking up to my open bedroom door. He is tall and lanky like Nate. He is so tall, his head is above the doorjamb. I feel fear. He is going to harass me. He then walks down the stairs to go to the bathroom. I sneak out of my room and run into my brother's room (actually the room my parents had). I crawl under the covers with one of my brothers trying to hurriedly pull up the covers over me. He's coming back up the stairs and I know a part of my shoulder may be visible. I know this won't work and I'll probably got my brothers in trouble too, but I stay there. He comes in and looks around. I think he sees me, but lets me be. He leaves. I go quickly back into my bedroom to the closet to try and change clothes before he comes back. As I pull a dress off a hanger, I am standing in the closet, which seems to have lots of room. A weird-looking girl comes and watches me. I tell her to go away. I pull on my dress, which I wonder if it is too fancy and will call attention to myself. I go downstairs to the kitchen where my mother is fixing French toast for breakfast. She wants me to do something and is grumpy. [BL] (248 words)

I seem to be the prison warden. The men are surly and dangerous. I have to stop something and I use fast karate blows. I am damn good at it and beat my foe. Another powerful inmate is watching me closely, looking for his opportunity. I then go to the infirmary for the doctor to bind up my wounds, but he is also my fiance and he rejects me, I think because he doesn't want me doing this dangerous job. I am hurt, but bravely go on. I return, exhausted and emotionally drained, to my office and find a young woman and a Hispanic man trying to make out on the floor by my door. I tell her to be in my office at 3 o'clock and I'll teach her about birth control and then I decide the man better be there too. This was yet another betrayal and I am angry and self-righteous, and yet I'm trying to be doing the right thing for these people too. I enter, but it isn't my office; it is a courtroom. I interrogate the prisoner who is on trial, the man I beat up, and the other powerful man is secretly sending him signals by scraping the legs of his chair against the floor when he should not answer. I realize this is a code even though it is subtle. I am on the alert. [BL] (233 words)

I and another woman are entering a big auditorium. We want to get good seats so we can see the events on the stage and meet in the back with our small group easily. It will be very crowded soon, we know, because we went through this before. I go to the left rear side and get a folding chair and then decide to go to the right rear side as that's where the small group will meet, but the athletic team has reserved most of the seats in the back and so I change my mind again and go to the left rear side to find all the places are almost taken and finally decide on the aisle. The ceremonies are starting and I lean way over to see. It is Rosalie, the Mayor of E City doing a discussion or speech and she's written "Rosalie" on the blackboard. It's just one word, her own name. I laugh and share this with a woman next to me. Then a male actor comes in and waits his moment. As he gets up to take a leather bag up the aisle shouting his lines, I realize the fingers of my left hand are caught in the straps and I am running up the aisle behind him, desperately trying to get my fingers out. I am wearing a bridal gown and veil. I finally get unstuck and go back and sit down. I tell the woman how embarrassed I am, how conspicuous I was. [BL] (252 words)

I am in a church community room and a group of church members are there. I have led them to believe that I am dying and they are having a ceremony for me. It is their tradition to gather in a semi-circle around the injured or dying person. Each member offers a gift and connects with the one who is dying in very touching, loving ways. The woman explaining uses the following example: "If a dying person wants to be treated like a queen, then someone might bring them a robe and drape it over them and bow and treat them like a queen." So, first the group stands in the front of the room and sings "Oh, Come all Ye Faithful." I stand in front of them, singing with them. I am deeply moved and near tears as I sing with them. The song is beautiful and I haven't sung for a long time, what with my throat difficulties. I am feeling very guilty for accepting all this outpouring of love on false pretenses, since I am not dying. Ellie is there sitting to my left. She looks at me, knowing I am cheating.

I have a questionnaire and I need three women and three men to answer it for me. I am on a bus and the door is open. A swarming crowd of revelers are all around. I watch as a man with a blue face lies on the sidewalk and tells the woman he's with that he loves her. I chuckle because it is obvious they are strangers and the man is horny. I try to ask several men to fill out the questionnaire. They are too rushed and busy. One hesitates and I kindly assure him he can go on, I can find someone else. Now the bus accidentally got caught in the Rose Parade. The marchers are a bit annoyed at us and we try to drive out of the way and park in a parking lot. We see a man who is very angry at a policeman for reprimanding him and he is angrily smashing the policeman's car to bits. Now I am in a huge house, perhaps a mansion. I am worried about Charla. A woman has lured her away and has taken her into one of the rooms and is molesting her. I see an image of Charla with her vagina exposed. I race from room to room opening doors and looking. I hear Charla calling off in the distance. Maybe she's on the third floor. I keep looking, worried. [BL] (234 words)

I am moving to an old house with odd rooms that spread out all over. Dwight/Howard is going to help me. Lucy and two babies are there. I am holding one and she is holding the other. We are trying to get them to nap as I walk around trying to think and organize how to manage this huge task. Finally, I get the baby to sleep. I open a door and it is a small bathroom. Really, only a bathtub is in it. I look at the kitchen, which has two or three wooden oak tables (dining room type) hanging way up on the wall for counter space. That will be awkward. Dwight/Howard comes in and I am frustrated trying to get his attention. He finally listens to my ideas but sighs and says, "It won't work. We made a mistake buying this rambling house and a mistake moving to M City. We belong back in the valley, so let's not take such care where things go and only unpack the essentials until we can move again." He then suggests we be friends again. I say, "No way." Now I kind of give up and sit on the couch with an older woman. I make a snide remark about how she can't work either because she's so old, and I can't work, cause I'm so old too. It's a sort of frustrated joke. Nothing seems to be going right. No one is helping. [BL] (244 words)

I am going down a street and see Archie, who is very sad. He is growing older and has a disability, a limp or something. He can't do his dance as he has before. I point out I know what that's like. I try and be sympathetic with him. I am interrupted by a woman who works for Lori and Dan T. She asks me to come to the office. I tell Archie to wait and I go into an office room. Lori is there, rather upset with me, and hands me a paper. I feel trapped and don't want to deal with this face to face, but now that I am here, let's get it over with. The paper is a bill for a phone call made by a Mr. Nelson for $48. She wants me to pay it. I hesitate and then get clear. "No," I say, "I will not pay this bill. It is not my bill. And furthermore I am very unhappy that you billed me for the carpet. I will not pay for that. In fact, I am expecting you to reimburse me my prorated rent and my security deposit." She becomes very upset and dramatically says to her woman assistant she cannot listen to any more of this. Her face is contorted in over-dramatic nerves. I am aware of Archie waiting for me across the street. I feel compelled to try and get to him, before he gets upset and leaves. I am caught in the middle again. [BL] (254 words)

I and some other women are in a room. I see water pouring into the room. I get very concerned. The room will fill up soon and we will drown. We look for an escape route. I see a window. We end up in another room, only the water is following us. I look out another window and see a huge drop off. It's a well or tower area, but I look way up and see daylight. There's an open area up there. It's our only chance -- to go with the flow of water out the window and dog paddle in it until it rises up high enough to reach that light. It's like walking into death and riding it up to life. We do so and successfully make it, only to find that area of the castle is filled with men who intend to rape us. What irony! [BL] (150 words)

I am getting into a group of women who are going into a bleachers area to sing group songs. I don't know what holiday it is, but this is a usual holiday thing to do. I and Andrea are trying to catch up with our group, but get lost and end up with a group of swimmers and divers. There is a swimming pool to the right, and in front of our bleachers is a pool used as the stage area. I watch a scene where a man and a woman get in a small rectangular rowboat and sing as we all sing the chorus. A wave or two comes up and splashes the woman and she mimes jumping up real quick so it doesn't get her all wet on her bottom. I and Aunt Bridget are sitting on the right side of the bleachers. It is very crowded. We sing along with the group but don't know the songs. I notice my voice is clear and pretty and I seem to be able to keep up with the words by listening carefully. I look over to the bleachers on my left and up and see a small group of people in green sort of fish costumes with green makeup on their faces. They are pretty and all the same. Now muffins and cookies and cakes are being served to the crowd and I can see they are moist and sweet and would taste really good, better than if we'd stayed with our own group. I look to my right and notice the water is all gone from the swim pool. There had been some girls taking lessons there. [BL] (279 words)

I try to do some dishes and find a pretty cobalt blue pitcher where the handle and the spout are on the edge seams of the square corners. It's really cute. It has the words "Howard's Place" printed on it in white ink. Now I can't get the kitchen faucets to close down no matter how I turn them. I finally ask Howard how to do it. He is in the bathroom showering and I knock on the door. He calls out how. I do it. Then I go into another kitchen; more mess. I sigh. I must have not done a thing for a long time.

I am upset with myself because for years I'd been taking a few classes here and there and often not finishing them or doing the work. I have a long string of incompletes on my transcript. I am wishing now that I had chosen a 2-year master's program and just focused on that and done it. I'd have something by now if I'd done that. Some how this has to do with moving to a new city to turn over a new leaf, many years ago. The feeling is that in some other dream I had moved to a city to start school. Now in this dream I'm at the other end. So I try to do some homework and now I go to the school office to pay my tuition and fill out papers. The secretary is busy and I watch a mentally retarded girl lean over the counter, laying on it in my way, so I walk to the right and catch a secretary's attention. She asks for $56. I hand her a sealed envelope with my tuition in it. I thought it was to be $53. She opens it and pulls out a piece of paper where I had drawn pictures. I look at it and am surprised to see many different pictures of my cat in different poses and postures. I thought I'd only done one. I point out the empty spot where the mentally retarded girl had blocked my way. The secretary says, "That's a cold spot." I say yes, because that's the feeling I got from it. [BL] (263 words)

I am at some big college-like school. Some of the women students have stolen a recently dead man's corpse and are playing with it, doing some silly witch-like rituals over it for fun. I and a woman friend are shocked to see this (in the gym). After they are done, the audience is leaving and so are we. I say to my friend, "Come on, let's follow and see if we can retrieve the corpse and take it back where it belongs." My friend is in agreement and is surprised I cared enough to do this. We figured the element of surprise will be with us, because we are so quick to go to where I am sure they are going to leave it, namely in the sorority lunch room activity center area. I search and search, in drawers, opening doors, etc. and finally find a box which it might be in. I pick it up and sneak off to find the male professor that it goes to. I go down the halls hoping to remember his name. I find a college of his and ask to talk to him. I begin to wonder just who I can trust here. [BL] (200 words)

The first moment I laid eyes on this white, large, two-story house, I loved it. The woman who owns it says she'll sell it to me and I can move in right now and we'll do the papers later. I and my daughters start to move in. Each can have their own bedroom, the outside lawn is spacious and pretty, the rooms large and comfortable. I begin to be concerned because I haven't even asked how much for the house and if I will qualify for a bank loan for that amount. I am tired of living in my cramped little house, but it was the best I could afford. This will be much more. I see the short, almost midget-sized woman who owns it and go to her. I say, "I want to talk about the details before I get all moved in and then have to leave." She is busy driving a tractor towing a cart and I follow her, talking all the while. She smiles and wants to know what that other woman said about her. I say, "Nothing much." I didn't really listen. She says, "Good. Don't worry. We'll make a deal." She wants me to have the house.

We are joking and he is surprised I am fun to be around. I show them another meeting room I had prepared. They ask if there is enough room for 20 people. I say, "The room capacity is 135, I would think there would be enough room." Now I am looking at pictures in a magazine of a M City-like region with a old "Gabby Hayes" kind of man in the picture.

I was looking at the moon and another thing that kinda looked like a cutesie-poo sun. I was with my friend Anna L., and Rita L., her mom, but it wasn't really Anna's mom - it was someone who looked like her mom. And then Rita got transported to the moon and told the people on the moon to take a man who looked like Al L. (Anna's father) and transport him to the moon. So they went down to earth (the people on the moon) to get the person who looked like Al, but Al - or rather the person who looked like him - did not want to go. The people who came from the moon told the person who looked like Al that the person who looked like Rita said to bring him to the moon. But then the person who resembled Rita said that she never said that. But the people from the moon said they had proof because they had one of Rita's 200 earrings. And that was the end.

I was a little boy, well maybe 8 years old, and I was holding one of those model rockets that really blasts off. The rocket was tattered. My clothes, which was a suit, was tattered, and my mom's expensive dress was tattered. My mom was really sad, and she kept saying, "You blew up 100 thousand acres! A 6th of the property!" I was embarrassed. Evidently I had wrecked a lot of stuff with my rocket. In the dream I think I really ruined my house.
Setting: In a room that once was in a mansion, but now looks like a bomb went off in it.
Characters: Me, a rich little boy, and his mom. I was watching "Richie Ray" (the poor little rich boy) yesterday, and I think I was Richie and the woman was his mom.
Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, shame. My little brother is very interested in model rockets. I was watching Richie Ray yesterday.

It was dark out, and I was in my back yard. I think that there was a dance going on, because there was loud music playing. Then a bunch of kids from my school come in my yard, and start dancing.

I rush into my house, because for some reason I didn't want my parents to know there was a party in my back yard.

Characters: Me, my mom, a crab (the crab was not intelligent).
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. When I woke up, I was afraid and was wiping on my shoulder.

I don't know when I had this dream, but suddenly I remembered it: Me and some of my friends in my class at school that was studying ETs, were at a dry dusty place. In front of us was a very high ladder that led to a black blimp-shaped building. We climbed, and when we got to the top we couldn't open the door. It was really dangerous, and we all freaked out. Finally, we got the door open and walked into a nice room with a black leather couch. A man dressed in all black turned to us, surprised. He welcomed us in, but my friends were gone. He was an astronomer, so I stayed to get info for my class that was studying ET life, and somehow I agreed to stay for at least a week. But my parents had wanted me to come home. [Drawing of a blimp-shaped thing with a square cabin hanging below, suspended in space, with a ladder leading up to the cabin door. The blimp has three windows. There are clouds in the sky.]

I don't remember when...): I was going to school at the public school near my house. I signed up to do a class like a class I have at school. Suddenly, I was back at my school, doing a project you have to do for that class. The new class was nothing like my old class, and I hated it.

Bay Area girls: Grades 4-6:#219-01 (5th grader, 01/18/97)

I was saying "miss" and then there must have been an interruption/commotion. After, I think someone answered me with a rude remark. It was some sort of takeoff on a play and the part that I was reading, but the surroundings were not correct. It came and went quickly, or so it seemed. P.S. I think that I was so excited about this new dream journal that I tried to control my dream too much. That's why I can't elaborate.
Setting: In a green room instead of a stage, as if the play was in real life. More like an office painted green.
Characters: I was there, but as a different lady. Everyone else was unfamiliar. I think they were all busy, bustling around, with no time for my lady, even though she worked there with them.
Feelings and Thoughts: Neutral. I don't think much of it. It seems normal, and this particular one, unlike others that I've had in the past, doesn't seem to be trying to get a message through to me.

I was playing my violin with all my music friends. I am much more advanced than "Twinkle, Twinkle" but still, that's what we were performing. Last night I had a violin recital for real and played my hard pieces. At the end though, I played the duet to Twinkle. In my dream there was a girl at my level, or a bit above, who played Twinkle by herself, and then my other friends and I played duets but completely messed up. (This part didn't happen in real life.)
Setting: It was on the stage: the same one from last night for real.
Characters: There were all of my violin student friends. A group of girls who I play music with and goof off with. Some are a little bit spacey, but I still have fun with them.
Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, confused. I'm sort of wondering about it, because I know I did well in the real concert. I woke up with my arms in the violin position!

I was on some sort of a baseball team; a sport I don't care for and have only played twice when I was forced to in P.E. We were a bad team and always lost, though we hadn't really played any games yet. I didn't care if we won or not, but mostly I was concerned about the ball giving me a concussion. A very good team came to our field, but not for a game. One of them called out times of the day and then batted the ball where a clock would show it. For some reason two kids and I were trying to find a fence to put up somewhere, but we weren't successful at all.
Setting: It was on a field I've not seen before, but sort of a combination of the school's and the one my brother's team plays at.
Characters: There were mostly kids with a few coaches, our P.E. teacher from school was the assistant coach and the real coach was cruel. The kids on my team were a mishmash of grades, but were all from school. The two friends mentioned were in my grade. They were good friends of mine, but they really wanted to win as well as get the fence up. There were some kids on the other team from my school, but they were two grades above us at least.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I'm sort of curious if I'm going to enter a baseball team because I sure haven't been thinking about it!

I dreamt of acting in this play thing with my friends at school. I had what I thought was a really dumb part and our director was mean. We had to show another kid (some boy and I) down to where we were, and even though she wasn't supposed to be in the play, she kept sneaking in our room and singing out of tune with my singing group. The pianist was annoyed.
Setting: In a spacy basement of our school which I've never seen. But every time I'm in a performance in a dream, that's where it is.
Characters: They were boys and girls in my class, a cruel director that has never been mean in real life, and an annoyed pianist.

I was with my real mom and she was driving me somewhere. When we came back home, there was a big commotion. My brother, who hated our step-uncle, was selling all of our step-uncle's possessions vigorously. He was selling them for money that didn't exist and he didn't care until my dad talked to him. My step-uncle came home and he was in big trouble.
Setting: In the hallway, kitchen and garage of my house presently.
Characters: My supposed brother was an enemy from school. I was me with my mom and dad. Our step-uncle was some classic cool guy.

I was in a 1/2 P.E. class and 1/2 picnic with the P.E. teacher. It was a very odd situation. We were passing food and writing names on bits of paper: names for basketball partners. All of a sudden, some sort of low-flying, child-created, kid-driven aircraft came toward us. It touched some heads and playfully bumped a few of us purposely. When the 7th grade driver told us he could have injured us badly, I got terrified.
Setting: Basketball court on a hill on which there was a picnic table.
Characters: Half of my class now and half of the grade below us. The 7th grade driver was my brother's good friend. Our regular P.E. teacher was extra nice.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I have absolutely no idea where it came from except I wrote down the name of a long-lost friend on my basketball partner paper.

I was at my friend's house and we were working on some sort of difficult long-lasting project which we never seemed to finish. Her computer didn't have the right software for the graph program that we needed, so we were asking all of the families on the block if they had it.

Setting: At my friend's house, but it was slightly deformed.
Characters: My friend, her mom and dad, me, her little brother, her friends and their parents.

It looked like it was on TV.

My mom and my dad were going to some place and me and my brother were going to some place you could drive to. I guess my brother was driving, and my rats were loose in the back seat. I didn't know, but we had to stay over that night in this place and I didn't know where to put the rats. When we got to a restaurant, I opened my door and my rat ran out and over to the piano. She started playing and she was very good. Finally I got her and my other rat, into the car. We had brought this food bowl thing with a cover and I though we should put the rats there, but Brian, my brother, didn't. Then I woke up.
Setting: At a restaurant, my real house, and on the road while we were driving.
Characters: Me, my brother, my mom, my dad, lots of people at the restaurant that were clapping for my rat when she played so good on the piano.
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. I don't really know. But I was angry when I was fighting with my brother, Brian, about where to put the rats. P.S. I watched a movie the day before and it was about a kid who played the piano. And I was playing with the rats a lot yesterday. Also, in the movie the kid played at a restaurant. He just walked in and played (like my rat did).

Well, anyway, the place I was in was full of people with earrings, nose rings, lip rings, etc. I was the odd one, I was wearing cords and a white shirt. Then this guy came over and made me go to the dance floor. He said that this girl wanted to dance with the guy but wanted to see how he danced. I was the tester. The guy took my hands and flung me way up to the ceiling then he swung me back up to the other corner. After this had continued for a while, I decided to stop when the ride was over. Also, the music stopped. Then I was sitting by this big water tunnel thing and an alarm went off. Somehow the water was leaking. I looked next to me and saw that a bag had broken and was spilling out water. I told them that. Then I held the bag closed. Somebody said that people were already going through the escape tunnel, so I went over and put my foot in the way so the next person couldn't go. Then I explained why.

I was in a classroom at my school and was sitting in a circle with a teacher and a group of people. The teacher brought in some strawberries that were in a huge crate. None of them were ripe, but she didn't seem to notice. She passed them around for everyone to take a handful. Laura commented about them, but only I heard her. Then the teacher brought out really bruised peaches and passed them around too. "Anyone who likes to make sherbet, these work really well," said the teacher. "Peaches are my favorite fruit," I said to Zena. Later in the car, Leah's friend Mindy had gotten the extra peaches and was carrying them in a plastic bag. "Can I have one?" I asked. "Sure." "Can I?" asked Zena. "Yeah." "Can I?" Leah asked. "Leah, you already have two." "NO" said Leah, keeping the O on her lips. "Yeah, they're in that bag." Leah started sulking.

First of all, I remember two things in the dream that weren't related to anything. A front yard of a neighbor to My school, and a HUGE building that my dad drove me to that was some kind of palace. The person of importance there had a collection of big TinTin postcards hanging on a low wall. But the main part of the dream was that in P.E. we studied the first Olympics. Each of us got a randomly chosen sport, and I got the marathon. I had to draw a picture of a person running it. For some reason, I wanted to draw them holding a torch, but I woke up after my first try which looked like this: (picture).

I was at Hashy camp in Australia, and we were going to do this activity called the field game. It was freezing cold so Adam and I went into our dark room, to change. We tried to turn on the lights, but there was no switch that we could find. There were a bunch of weird things that we tried to switch, but the best we did was dimming green lights around the room. The problem? They only stayed dimmed. One time, I tried to find a switch and by accident rubbed my hand over some wires. I thought I would get electrocuted, but I didn't. I finally got changed in the dark. The game started by this boy catapulting a big stone off a cliff, and these big men had to hold him back from falling off the cliff.
Setting: Hashy camp, out of Melbourne, Australia.
Characters: My brother - not very helpful, usually.
Feelings and Thoughts: Frustrated. It was actually kind of what happened at Hashy camp, but no green lights. What I mean is that the light switches were hard to find and there was a "field game."

First of all, I somehow turned into a bee. I don't know how, but I did. Someone else that I can't remember did too. We were at the zoo, and were flying around and landed on a bench, right in front of the gorillas. I wanted to fly around some more, but whoever was with me told me to watch out for the plastic balls that they were throwing around. The other bee flew around, once to show me, but did get hit by a ball. I flew over, and saw that it was close to being dead. It didn't really mind, though, and talked about how cool it was to have a huge stinger, and told me to get a toothpick. I didn't, so it told me the only way to get us back to normal people was to make the noises like the gorillas. I did, and it worked. We picked up frisbees at the souvenir shop going out of the zoo. When I got home this thing like in the arrival - one that spins around and creates a whirlpool - type-thing and then makes everything into nothing, was in my house, and started. For some reason I wasn't scared at all and just sat there. It didn't harm me at all, but I threw my frisbee in (I don't know why).
Setting: At the zoo and my house.
Characters: The other bee - I don't know as a person or a bee, unafraid. No one else, except for I saw the Arrival, not too long ago.

First, me and Courtlyn were at this store. For some reason we couldn't go past this certain point that I wanted to go past. Then we went to her house, but it wasn't her current house, it was a huge mansion. I remember baking something sweet. Later that day, I went back to the same store with Sandy, Lynne, Claire and Brian. We did go into the part that I really wanted to go, but it wasn't all that exciting after all. But it was still pretty good. We all had bags, so we played "find the bag." I hid my bag behind a counter, but no one else had hidden theirs yet. Then Lynne went behind the counter and hid her bag there too, but she didn't see mine. Instead, she started babbling/shouting on and on about how it was the best hiding place. Brian, Claire, Sandy and I heard, but none of us went to find hers there.
Setting: In a big store and a big mansion.
Characters: I know Brian, Lynne, and Claire, but not very well. Sandy and Courtlyn are my really good friends. I can picture myself at a big store with them, but not with Brian, Lynne or Claire.

I was just hanging out near my locker, getting my stuff out, and had closed it. My perspective switched from birds-eye view to my POV right after this guy I liked, Neil, suddenly turned and embraced me. Then he walked away like nothing had happened. No one was left in the area but me.

I was staying with Patrick for the summer. It wasn't his house, though. It was way out in the middle of nowhere, and his parents weren't around. He could drive (he backed out of the driveway at 50 mph), but we both rode mountain bikes to some dimly lit store where he wanted to buy a wooden model airplane. It was a long dream, but in most of it I seemed to be changing clothes. I would just get out of bed and change from sleepwear to normal clothes, or vice versa. I had a broken leg.
Setting: At some old house that I've never seen, but that I thought of as Patrick's, and at a dim store.
Characters: Patrick, my 15-year old cousin, lives in a small town in Missouri. He wrestles, plays in the marching band, and has a broken leg. His leg was broken in a wrestling match when the other guy didn't stop when the referee blew the whistle.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, neutral. I don't know why so much was unreal. I think "middle of nowhere" came from something I was reading. I was embarrassed about changing in front of my friend yesterday. I rode bikes with a friend yesterday. Also, yesterday I thought about driving for a while. It was a very long dream.

It's hard to recall now. I was with a friend, and we were walking around an unknown city. People kept asking me "what I was wearing," and Charla walked up to me and asked where I had gotten my CDs. One was Fugees. My friend and I kept passing this movie theater, and I knew it was a dream because I couldn't read anything. A bunch of people walked out because the animated characters moved throughout the building. I saw this incredibly good-looking guy with a silver, a gold and a blue lip stud. He went inside, but my friend said he'd meet me behind the gold curtain. When I went there, there were naked people changing. The guy at the counter said I had a phone call, but we got disconnected.
Setting: A strange city, and mostly in and around a movie theater.
Characters: I think the friend was Leah, one of my classmates. Carla is my music/drama/dance teacher. I don't know the cute guy, but he was older, 15 or 16.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, sad, popular and confident. The curtains were the same colors as the studs. Last night, I was online and someone sent me a message saying they lived in Foster City and were interested in me, but we got disconnected. My friend and I talked about lip pierces yesterday. Also, both in the dream and yesterday, my friend was pressuring me to tell this guy I really like him.

I was at my friend Arlie's house and her mom suggested that we take their dog for a walk. I know that Joey lived down the street and we might see him. So I convinced her to go with me. We were heading out the door with her dog, when all of a sudden these grownups (maybe friends of her parents) showed up and Arlie's parents and them decided to come with us. We were trying to get away from them so we wouldn't be seen together. Finally, all the adults except one who had a little two year old girl. When we got to Joey's house, we noticed that we were wearing our ugly My school sweats and T shirts (which are from our school that we have to wear every morning and on trips sometimes - when Arlie and I went on a school "midyear retreat" and we had to wear our school clothes it was really embarrassing). This is especially embarrassing but we realized it didn't matter because Joey wasn't there. Also, I forgot earlier, there were two fine guys walking around who we saw and briefly talked to. I don't remember what we said.

Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, embarrassed. The embarrassing parts about clothes and adults was sort of reliving yesterday, and I always beg Arlie to walk down to Joey's house with me because I love him so much.

I was with my advisor (who is male) and we had just gotten back from a play/movie (I don't remember) and were in the Mark Antony Hotel (we stayed there in early October when the 7th and 8th grade went to Ashland, Oregon), and we had been discussing the way I present myself sexually, and how that makes others feel. Then we both got into bed (the same bed), and cuddled, like he might do with someone his age, and I am unclear if anything sexual happened after that, but if it did I remember he didn't think it was a big deal, and I was worried about what other people would think. But he made me feel relaxed. My brother was in the dream at the end.
Setting: Mostly in the Mark Antony Hotel, in a room I recognized as one I had stayed in before.
Characters: My advisor (I will leave out his name), who acted laid-back, and relaxed like he always is in real life. I think my brother appeared in the very end. He is 10, short, and looked like himself. I was also in it and for the most part I saw the dream through my eyes, though part of it I could see from 3rd person (perspective).
Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Unsure about what I was doing, worried that other people would think I'm weird for sleeping with my advisor, relaxed because he though it was okay, uncomfortable because I'd never done it before, friendship and respect because my advisor is my friend and I have respect for him, I guess. (I've made it sound like it was awful, but it was really a nice dream and I enjoyed it.)

I drove in my friend Chloe's car and her mom dropped us off on some unrecognizable road. Chloe, another friend, and I played on the street for a while, then rollerbladed (or maybe ice skated) to like a movie theater/bar/disco. The movie playing was a horror movie. As I left walked through the bar into the disco. Chloe and Robin eventually joined me, then Chloe's mom picked us up again, and dropped us off at the road we'd started on. We then discovered that one of the houses on the block belonged to our principal. Then we stole a bottle of Peach Nectarine sparkling juice that was outside his house, drank most of it...I can't remember past there...
Setting: First on a suburban road I didn't recognize, then in a movie theater, a bar, and a disco.
Characters: My friend Chloe, my friend Robin, Chloe's mom, and maybe my principal, though I'm not sue he actually made an appearance; oh, yes, and a guy named Atum who appeared very briefly.
Feelings and Thoughts: I don't remember. I think it's a little odd that we were stealing sparkling juice from the principal, but it doesn't surprise me that we were trying to be stupid and rebellious.

Most of the dream I can't remember. I think I had been on a camping trip, and on the way back we stopped in something like the Star Dome; I lifted up the flap of this big rubber star shaped thing, and inside I saw what I thought were three bats. When I got out, I think I remember being back on the camping trip, in a place similar to a camp site we stayed aton a camping trip I took with my dad. Now, everything after that is a blur, but I seem to remember some man (who I think represented my father, though didn't look quite like him) being shot, and as some police man dragged him off he handed me a strawberry smoothie. I also remember meeting with the 7-8th girls, but I don't know where or why.
Setting: Inside something that was star-shaped, and made of rubber, blown up like a balloon; some parking lot, unrecognizable.
Characters: There were three bats with red eyes; I think my friend Chloe got in there (she went camping with us this summer); some man who I think represented my dad; the My school 7th-8th girls.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, shocked. Bats and camping are a little weird, but I think seeing my father shot (which probably came from some movie I watched) is a little disturbing. What could it symbolize? Nothing, I hope.

All I remember is being a caterpillar (I think I was male, because I remember coming "home from work" and finding my wife already there). We were in a cherry tree. The first dream I can only remember hugging a fairly young boy, and his two older brothers saying something along the lines of "Don't become too attached." The dream after (before the caterpillars) I as in the Nature Company store, or maybe a science museum gift shop.
Setting: In a cherry tree; I don't remember the next one; in a museum gift shop.
Characters: My caterpillar wife; a boy of about 10; his older brothers of about 16-17 (I recognized none of them). I think I saw Anna (an 8th grade girl at My school).
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, surprised. The dream I wrote down second is the one that interests me the most. I know there was more to it, and it was a lot more complicated, but my mind just moved on to the caterpillar home.

I dreamt I was lying in the snow in Alaska and was having seizures and nobody was coming to help me. That's because I realized in my dream that I was actually in my bed. In my dream, I was dreaming. (In real life, when I woke up, I found I had a fever of 102 degrees and was chilled. I was having violent convulsions and my throat was dry from coughing. My head was bleeding because I hit my head on the bedside table during one of my convulsions. Nobody had come to help me.)
Setting: In my bed, in my home.
Characters: It was only me.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, sick, alone. I have no idea where it came from, but I think my mind was just reacting to my body movements in my sleep.

I was lying on my bed in my room, but everything in my room was on fire. I couldn't get my covers off me and my vision started to blur. I saw my great-grandmother coming through the fire to get to me and take me up to Heaven with her. I walked to the door where she was. Then I was whizzing through a tunnel with her while a golden light was pulling us on. I loved it. (Real: when I woke up my mom was shaking me and she said that I hadn't been breathing and she couldn't find a pulse on me.)
Setting: First in my bed, then through a gray tunnel that was really windy.
Characters: My great-grandmother was in my dream to take me to Heaven.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy when I saw my great-grandmother; scared my room was on fire; relaxed & excited in the tunnel. I think I might have had a "near-death" experience. When I woke up I wanted to go back to the golden light and my great grandmother. I have always wanted to meet her and I finally got to. But now that I think about it, I almost died. This strengthens my faith in God even more, because now I know that he wants me to live even just a little while longer. My fever was 105 degrees when I woke up.

I had just spent the night over at my best friend's house and we were waking up on a gorgeous spring morning. She had to go to school, but I didn't, so I wanted to go with her. She lives less than a block away from her school, and I was jealous that she could wake up at 7:30 and make it to school by 8. I was shaving my legs with her electric razor and then we went into her back yard and went swimming in the cool water.
Setting: At my friend's house.
Characters: My best friend.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed, refreshed. I think I want all this rain to stop and I want it to be spring. I LOVE spring!

It was like watching a cartoon show. There was this guy and he left home & met a girl, but she didn't like him all that much. He was pretty stupid. Back home his little sis (about 5 years old) & his parents are watching a movie. The parents were sitting on her to keep her quiet. All I saw was their butts and her head & shoulders. She was squirming and when she finally got her head out she yelled something like "(brother's name) got out of the house and is running around with a girl!" Then back to the girl & guy. They suddenly had a fat guy friend with them. They did some stuff, but all I remember is a scene with the guy on a pay phone in a hotel with the other two standing around. The girl got mad and walked away. The guy dropped the phone and followed. There was more but I don't remember it.
Setting: All different places, but I didn't recognize them.
Characters: I don't know any of the people.

I was going to fence someone but all of the swords didn't have long blades. I asked some buy to fence and he turned out to be my friend's brother. We were talking and he told me he was taking calculus XZ. Then he smiled at me and I think I liked him. He said two nice things to me and said something about the difference in our age. Then he said, "You aren't using my sister to get to me?" I said no and he said, "I don't want my sister to get hurt." Before that, we were at camp and assigned to jobs before the feast. I went downstairs to this beach; someone was telling me about how people died in a volcano here. It reminded me of Mt. Vesuvius. Then me & Jeanette went down a dark road in a car to go grocery shopping even though it wasn't my job. Then I went down stairs to the boys school where my old crush R. went to school. I was looking for him but I couldn't find him.
Setting: At camp, at a beach, in Woodside, at an all-boys school.
Characters: Frank & R. Both were ex-crushes I had decided that I didn't like any more the night I had the dream. The two girls are my friends. I didn't know who the other person was. Frank looked different than he normally does. I met him like I met my current crush, Eli.
Feelings and Thoughts: Anxious, in love, happy, sad. I woke up thinking Frank loved me until I remembered it was only a dream. I was scared when the person told me the people had died in the year 226.

I went to school and we were doing Drama. Steve asked me, Melissa and Liz to sing in front of everybody. I don't like sitting in front of people so I sort of mouthed it: Then Steve, the Director, said Great! Liz, you're cast as Juliet, Melissa, you're cast as Lady Capulet, and Kelly, you're cast as the nurse. I felt cheated. I cried and said "I never even auditioned for the parts." Steve said that Melissa could sing the song in the play. I didn't even want the part of the nurse. I wanted Juliet.
Setting: It took place at the stage (where) we usually had our performing night at school. It also took place at school.
Characters: Steve is the director and the middle school head, and plays heavy favorites. Liz is a really popular "strong" actress, she never fells (sic) the parts. Melissa is a really homely person who is Steve's favorite and Carol is an okay actress. Liz is Steve's (illegible).
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, sad, cheated, mad. I felt sad that I never got a chance and Steve would cast me as the part I wanted no matter now good I was.

We went to a restaurant like we always do on Sundays with my parents. Then Mrs. H. came up to me and told me and Courtney that I needed to get measured for the wedding. She said Alessandra, Monique de Brian would measure us. Monique had this weird measuring device like a stick that she put over Courtney's chest. Then Monique was hitting a ball with a piece of metal from her sword. I tried doing that by throwing it but I couldn't. Then Saul made me bend my knees and make sure my arm was above my lets. Then I threw the rock really far into a pile of rocks. Then I was walking down a big mossy step to this guy I knew from somewhere. Then I talked with Courtney and Melissa about my school. I was visiting there and Linda came up to me. I had to tell R. than you for something. Then Courtney said that she didn't want to go to my school because the female admissions director had been mean to her. Then the scene played again, and I saw what happened: It was strange. The I went to Burlingame Avenue with 2 people from my school, and went into a gourmet food store that sold Margaritas. The other stores didn't, even though they had displays up telling people they did. Then the crackers started bouncing up and down in a strange order. I wanted the garlic and cheese ones. Monique said she had been fencing since she was 3, then 2 1/2. While she was measuring me, Jacob, and Patty, his wife, gave us a (illegible) about something confusing but it was supposed to be about love.

I was at My school but it didn't look like My school. Stuff happened that I can't remember. The me and a few other friends went to the classroom next to where were sleeping. It looked like classroom 2 at school, but had more stuff in it. My friend A. said that tequila tastes good with tortillas. I didn't find this at all strange. So we go into the classroom and ask if there are any tortillas. They say no but that there is pita bread, so we go in there and everyone else disappears. We look under the sink, which isn't in classroom 2 really, and underneath are big jugs (those square kind that cleaning stuff comes in) and they are kind of see-through and there is yellow-whitish liquid inside. On them they say something I don't remember. Anyway we pour the tequila into margarita glasses and eat it with pita bread. Some stuff happens. (I think that it has gotten later but I'm not sure.) An elderly black man comes in and says he has to check us. We immediately think he's talking about us drinking tequila. I'm the type who would break down and tell everything we were doing. I look, about to laugh at this black girl to my right (A.'s on my left). She put her long dark red nails in her mouth (a normal gesture as if biting her nails), and leans her head down and tells me no (don't tell). The man goes and checks behind a mirror inside a mirror like the illustration. Behind, there are some photos. Inside were the photos that showed the snake that bit one of the teachers. This was a big mystery, solved. Then we went away. I think later there was a big commotion with the teacher who had been bit.
Setting: At my school. Everything was kind of the same but a little changed.
Characters: My friend A. Schoolmates, kind a generic "classmates" - didn't know them. The black guy was mysterious. The black girl was the only person I recognized and communicated with other than my friend A., and one man.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. It was very weird but I told my mom I smoked marijuana once and maybe the tequila is related.

I was with my family. We went to buy something at a store and I found this CD I kind of wanted so I put it in a bag. Then I tried on these ugly rainbow-colored shoes. I put these in a bag. Later, we're driving and I see that I have stolen both these things, which I didn't mean to do. Then we see some black gangsters fighting and my mom sighs, "please don't start." Then they start punching people out and Tupac gets rolled in front of our car & starts screaming something at us.
Setting: In a shoe/CD store. Also on a street from a car-windshield point of view.
Characters: My family in the dream was just a generic family, I don't know them. Tupac is a famous rapper who died. He had some good songs. The gangsters were random, but one was Snoop Doggy Dog (also a famous rapper but he's alive).
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, indifferent. Well, yesterday I was looking at pictures of Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac. Even though in my dream Tupac looked nothing like Tupac, Snoop Doggy Dogg looked the same.

I was in a classroom with the rest of my class (8th grade). Steve, our teacher and principal, was calling up, one by one, the people with long hair and cutting their hair so that it was about jawbone length. I was the last person to be called up. I ran away and tucked my hair into my sweatshirt so that it looked like I had short hair already. Everybody looked at me like I was just being stupid, so I went over to Steve. I had to keep telling him not to cut it so short. It seemed like he finally cut it just above shoulder length. Then I was at home and looking in the mirror in my room. My hair was just below shoulder length. I wondered for about 20 seconds about why he had cut it shorter. I figured I just didn't see where Steve cut my hair. Then I noticed that my hair looked good at this length and looked at the mirror for a while.
Setting: Most of it took place in the classroom at my school. Some of it took place in my room.
Characters: Steve Smuin is my teacher and the school principal. My whole class, the whole 8th grade, was in the dream. I know them all.
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried, surprised. I felt like this really happened. One weird thing that I just realized is that my hair in the dream was straight, smooth, shiny. This wasn't really out of the ordinary. If it weren't for the hair-cutting, I wouldn't even have noticed it as a dream, not a memory. The feelings I had were really normal for being at my school.

I was in the war hospital running around trying to take care of patients, but I was running out of time or something. Then some other nurses came (Lt. Bfjik, and General Camand) and told me to take a break. The weird thing was that I knew that I was the one running around, caring for patients, but I didn't look like myself at all.

Me and a few other classmates were chosen to join in a space launch with aliens. Before we got to the launch door, Hillary & Melissa were shot by the aliens. But then I looked further up and Melissa & Hillary were there. The aliens had been imitating them. We went onto the launch & after we had taken off, they told us we had too many people. We had to choose the one to go. We chose Emily because she didn't hear us. Someone gave her an Orio and said he wanted to record exactly how she ate it. She willingly took one cookie and described it as she went along. She pulled it apart and said she had to lick the cream filling first, and then she ate the outside. Immediately after eating it, she looked at her arm and it started to turn green with red splotches, just like the aliens. She was pretty angry at us for tricking her. I somehow became their leader and one day I got so stressed out that I went for a walk and swim in a gorgeous little pond. After my swim, I went down to some sort of store and outside was a man. That's all I remember.

Remember loose bear. My class was having a party in the same building they film either Star Wars or Star Trek, and we were going to sleep over. Our photography teacher was there and when the rest of the class was off doing something, I talked with Jan and he basically told me that he was homeless. After I talked with him I went to find a place to sleep. I went up to the loft and I saw Diana holding on to the top of her rolled up sleeping bag when it was vertical. Then it just fell over and I thought she could only do that because it was her birthday. I decided not to sleep in the loft because I would be so separated. There was a bear chained down in a room and after I looked in the loft, I looked under the wall to bear's room and I saw a bear foot chained down. I poked my head all the way through and the bear was gone. Steve was with me and picked up a rifle and I told him not to and he just scoffed at me. I picked up a rifle, then said, "OK, fine." I also picked up a handgun and ran out shouting that there was a loose bear. I ran into the room and they were filming Star _____ and shouted the warning and everyone panicked. I said, "Use only tranquilizer darts." Steve said, "Yeah, right."
Setting: An old warehouse.
Characters: Tom (photography teacher), Steve (classmate), Diana (classmate), Bear (I have no idea).

Bay Area girls: Grades 7-9:#587-01 (8th grader, 01/18/97)

When it started we were at some sort of party. All the kids from my class were there, although I didn't see them all. I just knew they were there. All the teachers were there too. I can't remember what went on for a while, but then Steve told Melissa to share what happened to her. She said, "No, that's all right. I don't really have to." Steve and Todd told her she had to. So she told everyone she passed her math exam and everyone applauded. The somehow it was Nina who had told the news, and tears came to her eyes and she went running to the bathroom, and Courtney and I followed. When we got there, she had locked herself in the stall. I said, "Nina, why are you crying? You passed your math exam!" And she said, "Get away from me, you fat, ugly bitch." Anne had also come in the bathroom in time to hear this, and she walked to the stall, unlocked it, and went in. Then Julia went in too. I don't remember what happened, but a lot of the 7th graders came in, including Anna. For some reason we were throwing a tomato around the room and it bounced off Anna's shoulder. She was worried that she'd smashed it, but Nina said, "Don't worry, you're not fat like Hilary." I can't remember what happened after that. I think I woke up, but the dream continued for a minute, then changed.
Setting: At my school, and my school bathroom.
Characters: Nina & Melissa, two of my best friends. Todd, my math/science teacher. Anne & Julia, two really good friends. Steve, my advisor, head of the school. Courtney, a friend of Anna, my "little sister" (at school, 8th graders get a 7th grade "sibling" to help them adjust to middle school).
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried, concern. When Nina said I was a fat, ugly bitch, I was hurt and angry, but I didn't show it. Melissa really did pass her math test, and they told the entire 7th and 8th grades (it was an accomplishment for her because in two years she's never passed a math test, so they wanted to acknowledge her work).

I don't remember what was happening in the beginning, but then all the 8th grade girls were going to one room and all the 8th grade guys were going to another room. I went out of the room, went outside at the bottom of a hill, and Julia came down too because there wasn't enough room where all the girls were. Somehow there was a round table set up out there, so we were writing on it. Then Evan called out a window, "Do you think we could bring that table up here?" I told him we could take it down, then roll it on the flat areas, but there was no way we could get it up the stairs. I don't remember what happened after that, I just know that Julia and I were having a great time.
Setting: In Steve's office (head of school) and the hill off 280 going to SF that has all the graffiti on it (but there was no freeway, just the hill).

I'm not sure how it started, but somehow I had been kidnapped. My kidnapper was a man. We were on the street and he said we needed to punch it out, except he taught me how to punch. Then we were walking down the street and I wanted to go home, so he said okay. Except he had to go soon. I saw a white Explorer, so I went to check the license plate but it wasn't ours. So we continued on. He said he would drive me home but he had no room in his car. (How weird an offer is that from a kidnapper?) Then on the street there was a Marriott or some hotel. So I walked inside to phone my parents, and it was a classroom. So I said, "Mom, I have to ask you a question." But then my mom woke me up.

There were some ghosts in it and then my sister tried to introduce me to air. Then the kitchen made me be in a team go-cart race. My little sister was on my team. We fought over the go-cart we got. I got a go-cart away from the rest of my team. We were doing fine and I as in the lead when all of a sudden I went down a hill and the track forked. I took the right path and it went down a steep hill and entered a room, but there seemed to be no way out but a staircase. So I climbed the staircase and went along the track. I was having a great time and I was sure I won when I got to the finish line ahead of everybody else. Then the referee said that I was disqualified because I didn't have my go cart.

I hardly remember anything so I'll just write about the bits I do remember. I remember looking for something and going up a hill to look for it and sliding back down it and slamming into a wall. I remember many houses along a street and the kids in the houses were falling in love with each other and sneaking through woods to see each other. I also remember a man who had been tricked into getting really mad, and while the town was in a circle having some kind of meeting, he lassoed them. And then he was never forgiven what he did. I think the person who tricked him was a woman. Soon the dream made more sense. I was racing through the woods with my younger sister and a whole bunch of other kids. Suddenly, I started moving my legs weirdly and I started to fly. Soon I had a balloon in one hand, my sister's hand in the other, two books under my arms, and I was flying above the treetops. I did not win the race but I did learn how to fly. When I got there, there was an adult who was surprised that I could lift off the ground with only two balloons (my sister was holding one). I also remember a poor family that lived in a big house that came from a warmer north.
Setting: In the country with lots of woods and a lake nearby.
Characters: There was the person I was searching with, the mad man, the tricky woman, the townspeople, the other kids, my little sister, the lady with balloons, and the people from the north.
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, excited. (Angry) when I ran into the wall and the man was being treated badly. I also felt excited when I started to fly.

I was in a swimming pool with Julia and Erin, and there was dirt on the ground of the pool, so when you swam across the middle you weren't allowed to put your feet on the ground. These guys were diving for a lid to a drink, and they had to pick it up with their mouths. Suddenly, my drama teacher was there and she made us turn around and not look as they dived for it so as not to embarrass them or something. That's what she does in the dance class during exams, when we have to make up a dance she makes everyone turn around so the person won't be embarrassed.
Setting: In a pool.
Characters: I'm sure Julia was there, plus Erin and my drama teacher and two guys. I didn't interact very much with the two characters, they just kind of followed me around.

I was doing a play, and we did lots of improv work. I think it was a school play, though it seemed like an acting camp I went to over the summer.

I went to summer camp, met a girl who liked my straightforwardness, and she gave me some false eyelashes. I remember thinking I'd forgotten all my hair products. Then I saw a little boy being beat up, so I went over to one of the guys and told him he was a fuck-up. He then asked me if I wanted my head twisted off, and got really pissed. So I told him he had misunderstood my comment, and what I really said was "I wanna fuck you up." So he changed his mind and fell in love with me, and we did this dancing-flying kind of thing. After we did this, I accidentally let go and flew into another room, and changed into a twin of the man in there. Then there was something in there about Dorothy/Judy Garland, but I don't remember. I don't remember the ending.
Setting: A summer camp (I'm not sure when/where).

Characters: Glenn, Anna, Robin and/or other person.

Bay Area girls: Grades 7-9:#606-04 (9th grader, 01/26/97)

The first part of the dream I was with a bunch of friends and we felt like doing something stupid and rebellious, but we figured we'd better have my other friend Sally along. Since nobody else knew the way to her house, I drove. Eventually we just sat around talking, eating cookies, and making scrap-books in the middle of the night, up in Sally's loft. I had some mini-dream about being in a computer game. Me and my family and family friends went to this Club Med, and they were all a part of the Club Med circus team, and they wanted me to do the trapeze. I'm an acrophobic, so they couldn't get me to do it. Right at the end of my dreams, Whitney Houston sang "I will always love you."
Setting: In a car along some fairly busy road; Sally's house/loft; in some sort of computer game; at a Club Med with a 50-foot flying trapeze.
Characters: A bunch of friends, though I distinctly remember Jon, Sally and Brian; nobody in the computer dream; my brother and mom I don't quite remember, but my dad and his friend Joel, and his two daughters were definitely there, and the trapeze guy, and Whitney Houston.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, terrified. I know the trapeze thing must have come from when I asked my dad last night what "fear of heights" was and he said acrophobia. I think my brother was playing computer games like that. And I was listening to the radio last night so Whitney Houston probably came from there.

Bea 1: a high school student:#001 (07/07/2003 (age 14))

I am on a trip to Italy with a lot of my friends and their families. I am thoroughly frustrated because most of the girls on the trip are my age and most of the boys are juniors and seniors. All the girls are acting slutty and fake and all the boys are buying it. I like Albert and he keeps being stolen away by a group of slutty girls. Everyone is ignoring me. So that night (in my dream), I just cried myself to sleep. I remember there being about 100 twin size beds just lined up against the walls. There was one room for the adults and one room for the kids. Everyone was talking loudly and having fun and no one noticed me crying. I am woken in the middle of the night (in my dream) to find Albert sitting on the edge of my bed. I remember seeing his deep blue eyes and they shone in the moonlight. I also remember looking around and seeing all the 100 beds completely empty. So then Albert leaned down and just kissed me really innocently and sweetly. But then there was a knock on the door so he pulled away and looked really afraid. He said, "I'll come back later" and left. Then I woke up because my mother really was knocking on my door to wake me up. (230 words)

So all of a sudden it stops really quickly and I fall to my knees and am perfectly waist level with both of them. So for some odd reason I think that they want me to give them head and I am really embarrassed so I stand up very quickly. When we reach the dining hall, it's packed with the entire school and then some. So Nick, Aidan, and I get out of the elevator. I'm walking towards the front of the dining hall and Nick is following me, saying, "Hi Bea" and I want him to keep following me and I want to talk to him, but I keep getting pushed so I lose sight of him and then I wake up.

I dreamed that there was this war happening and that I was much more involved than I am in the war now In class we would have drills pertaining to the war. It was really scary. So all the freshmen and sophomores went on this trip and Sue and I were left behind. So when the trip returned everyone sought to create everyone's worst nightmare. All these people were chasing me and trying to shoot me, which I guess is my worst nightmare. I ran into my house, which was like the Order of the Phoenix in Harry Potter. Mr. Bailey was there with a palette of nail polish, trying to communicate some code to me. But I couldn't figure it out. So then I escaped to a kind of vineyard where Sue's worst fear was being realized. Her worst fear was that everyone had found out some secret about her. So there were all these freshmen and sophomores tormenting her in the trees of the vineyard, saying things like, "We know, Sue..." and then I remember one of them saying "We know about Abbylius," (I just made that name up in my dream) and then I woke up.

I dreamed that I was on this train. In each different car was a different song playing. And no matter how much I liked the song that was playing, I was forced into the next car. It was really hot in the train so I was wearing my bathing suit. The train stopped at my high school's dining hall. I went in and everyone was studying for exams. I sat down at a table with my friends in my bathing suit. Ashley came up behind Olivia and put a lobster in her hair and we all screamed. Then she came after me with another lobster, so I ran away. I finally got back to my table and grabbed my bags before heading back to my dorm. On the way I saw Matthew and David, but they ignored me. Frustrated, I parachuted (yes, parachuted) away. I was so scared of Olivia and angry that Matthew and David had ignored me. When I got to the dorm, I realized that it was the beginning of school, even though I had just seen everyone studying for final exams. I realized I didn't live here anymore, so then I rushed to my new dorm where I found Sue. She told me that she, Hannah, 3 other girls, and I all shared a room in Bundy. When I got inside, I saw Hannah rearranging the furniture in a way-too-small room for 6 girls. I remember being furious that Hannah and I had to share a room with 4 other girls on Bundy 1, where all of Ms. Prong's favorite varsity athletes lived. I thought there had to be some mistake. I went to the closet to put my stuff there and realized that I had left all my clothes somewhere else. I ran back to the dining hall to look for them. All the doors were locked and I remember looking in the windows and seeing everyone in there being gassed to death. I remember seeing my father and Albert slowly dying. For some reason this didn't bother me at all and I rushed back to my room to find all my roommates playing name games, even though we already all knew each other. My other roommates' names were Brianna, Susan, and Kaylee. I was so frustrated I didn't have clothes, so I borrowed some from Hannah. Then I did have to take exams and I woke up. (403 words)

So I dreamed that it was May again and everyone was playing Assassin as usual. Only the whole school was divided into houses like in Harry Potter, and only the Slytherins could kill the Gryffindors, and I was in Gryffindor and couldn't kill anyone. The only way you wouldn't be killed is if you were caught with $10 and your school ID. So I was walking down the main hallway and James Franco, who was in Slytherin, killed me. But then I showed him my ID card and $10. But for some reason this didn't matter to him, and he took my money and ID card. So then I went to the library and Anthony was there. He was in Gryffindor too and he studied there for exams since it was the end of the year again. We were also hiding from the Slytherins. They were like the High Inquisitorial Squad from Harry Potter too. Anthony and I were studying, but we had a question about math, so we went to find Mr. Stipps, who was in his office blow-drying sour milk out of his hair. He was really mad that we saw him blow-drying his hair and threatened not to give us any more DVDs or help if we continued to stand there. So Anthony and I left. I went to see Hannah and Sue in Bundy and Anthony went to Langton. When I got to Hannah's room, she told me that Mrs. Frank had called and wanted me to babysit her children the next evening. She said I shouldn't because the next evening was the dance. So I picked up the phone to call the Franks to tell them I couldn't babysit, but as soon as I went to dial the number, a woman's voice came over the receiver and said I couldn't dial. I ran to Sue's room to use her phone, but the woman's voice came over her phone too. So I then went to each room on the floor but all the lines were tapped. I finally went to the last room to dial before the woman figured out that I was using that phone. But I couldn't dial the number because all the numbers had been rearranged and I couldn't find the proper ones. I ran all the way down to Houk to use the phones there. But when I got there the whole building was on fire. Everyone was carrying furniture out of the burning dorm. It didn't occur to me that this was weird, people going back into a burning building. There was a plate of treats for everyone who carried furniture out of the building. I started to go back to Bundy, but my legs were so weak I could barely stand. I kept stumbling up to Bundy. When I reached the small parking lot between Langton and Slate, I saw Hannah's dad in a car and he nearly ran me over. I kept trying to get up to Bundy. When I finally got there though, Mrs. Frank and her two sons were all waiting for me. Apparently they were a day early. Mrs. Frank told me not to listen to Seth no matter what he said, and I was so confused I woke up. (544 words)

I had a really scary dream that I went to see the movie 28 Days Later, which is supposed to be a scary movie about everyone getting a plague. So I was watching the movie in the basement of a factory or something. All the people I was watching it with got the plague from the movie. I got so scared and ran to my brother's room. He was there and we sat in his room and we were listening to Harry Potter on tape, but then he got the plague too! It was horrible. (95 words)

I dreamed that I was on this roller coaster water ride with Hannah and Sue. Just as we were going around a sharp corner, Hannah flew out into the water and drowned. I was so horrified that I woke up sweating. (41 words)

I dreamed that we were all going on a field trip. We were all organized into different buses and Sue and I were put on a bus with a lot of people we didn't know at all. So we were really frustrated. When we got off the buses we had to take out our English exam. I remember we were in this huge dark metal room underground. We were able to get our results the minute we finished the exam. But when I finished I couldn't get to where my results were. Then I remember beginning a new dream where someone was chasing me in the dark metal room, but then I woke up. (114 words)

I dreamed that Alexis and I were in this cooking show like 30 years from now because everything was really high-tech and modern. We were cooking something and all of a sudden 100 male strippers jumped out and started stripping. It was really weird though because Alexis and I wanted to leave really badly so we started looking for the exit. The woman who directed the cooking show was mean and scary and wouldn't let us leave until we had shelved all the cans that were all over the ground. And then we had to organize them alphabetically. So we started. Then one of the guys came up to us and said he would let us out if we helped him make dinner. So we tried to help him make dinner, but we couldn't for some reason. Then the cooking studio turned into sand and flames, a beach bonfire in the middle of nowhere. Then I woke up. (158 words)

I had a dream that I was giving a tour of my high school. When I entered the chapel, it was pitch black and I could see nothing except for this little boy with a laptop. He jumped up to greet me and then launched into this discussion of wireless Internet on campus. He wanted to show me how it worked, so he turned some of the lights on really dim. I was shocked to see about 10 other people in the pews, all really old and like the boy with laptops. He went into all these programs and messed around on the computer until the lights shut off of their own accord, indicating that he was now connected to the Internet. I was surprised and impressed and had lost my tour. But it didn't bother me. I went downstairs to the mailroom to find everyone happy and excited, all carrying or eating candies and chocolates, all with roses and dressed in pink. They all said, "Happy Valentines Day" to me. I was surprised because I had no idea it was Valentines Day. It was really dark so I couldn't find my mailbox, yet I could see all my friends with their stuff. As I finally started opening my mailbox, Leah explained to me how much candy she had received and who had given her roses and such. I opened my box to find only 5 pieces of candy. Feeling rejected, I walked back upstairs where it was light again. I remember hearing this voice behind me calling my name, and I looked behind me to see Sam running toward me with one rose. He gave it to me and kissed my cheek before leaving. Puzzled, I went back to my dorm, where I fell asleep really quickly. I was woken late that night because the fire alarm rang. Hannah and I ran out of the room to a secret hallway I never new about before. We were all to wait there until a train picked us up to bring us to safety. So when the train finally came pirates who had stolen it controlled it. They kidnapped everyone but me. I had to run and hide in a nearby bathroom. When they came looking for me, I cut them with razors and sprayed their eyes with hairspray, and basically defeated them with beauty products (weird). Then I woke up. (400 words)

I dreamed that I was in a bookstore with my family. My brother and I found books about Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, but they weren't the real Harry Potter books. We got them anyway. When we were checking out, my mother found a bag containing more bags of jellybeans. She was asking the main who they belonged to. I wanted the jellybeans and quickly told her they were mind and that I had bought them earlier. When we returned to school, I went to Sophia and Sue's room. Sue, Alison, Hannah, Aidan, and Jayden were all there and we started trying to take Sophia's bed apart to find something. Everyone was positive that it was an antique, Chinese-made bed, and therefore I would be able to take it apart and put it back together. I started to remove the different wooden panels, but never found out what we were looking for and couldn't put the bed back together. Finally Jayden and Aidan found a piece of wood shaped like an elephant that held the whole bed together like some sort of puzzle. So then I went back to my bedroom at home and fell asleep. But then Jackson, who had climbed up the tree near the window by my bed and was asking me to come outside with him. I was scared and moved to my desk. But my computer had been swapped with someone else's, and I couldn't use this one. Then, somehow, Jackson took my bed to his room. Horrified, I grabbed on and was flying to his room on my bed. When I got there he began taking my bed apart so that I couldn't leave; however, I got away anyway. When I got back home, my computer was right where it was supposed to be. I signed onto AIM and promptly started talking to Bill about his sister's relationship with his best friend, Sam. Then Jon signed on and asked me for my phone number to call me. I gave it to him and literally within the next 30 seconds, the phone rang in real life and I debated getting up to pick it up or not. But then I woke up and realized that it wouldn't be Jon calling since it had all been a dream. (382 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was walking through this swamp/bog thing. As I was walking, I came across a set of 5 bunk beds, all stacked up on one another. There were people having sex and they wanted me to join them. But I didn't want to, so I dredged on through the mud. Then I saw Jayden and Aaron fishing for frogs. With them was Aidan. He asked me to prom, but I didn't even know that the prom was so close, so I just kept walking. I finally had come to the end of the swamp and there were the dorms. For some reason Bellah was following me for accepted students day or something. So I tried to find my dorm room, but it was completely impossible. Instead of the hallway with rooms was a HUGE ballroom and lots of small dark corridors. And I couldn't find my room! Finally after walking around forever, I found my room. Outside it was a stack of books and a balloon with my name on it. Bella and I went in but there was yet another huge room. In this one was a cooking show. Fritz (my dog) was trying to guess what kind of sandwich they were making and he got tickled every time he got it wrong. I guessed PB&J, got tickled, and woke up laughing! (228 words)

I had a dream that I was on a long trip. We were all on this bus and we finally stopped at campus. I needed to find an alarm clock so I would wake up in the morning. I searched all the dorms to find a faculty member who would have one. Finally I went to Langton and the Mings gave me one I could borrow. They led me through the dorm, onto different hallways, and into different rooms. In each room there was no alarm clock. I became frustrated and then went down to Houk to find an alarm clock there; however, when I got near the School Archives at my high school, all the electricity went out. Everything just shut down. The only people from my trip I could find were Jayden and Aaron. We all walked past the Main Building. I think we were going to my house to see if the bus was there. Anyway, we eventually found the bus and started going to another private boarding school in a really small town similar to ours. When we got to the school, we all went to the locker rooms to shower. I accidentally went into the boys' showers and they all wanted me to join them. I guess I kind of wanted to, but I was scared so I went to the girls' showers. They were all wearing their soccer uniforms, so I just wore mine too while I showered. The next day we had to take exams. Sue kept trying to copy off mine. Then for our history exam we had to see Pirates of the Caribbean. Then I woke up. (276 words)

I dreamed that I was in school and I had the absolute worst schedule. I had 8th period four days in a row and on Wednesdays and Saturdays I had all the periods. It was horrible. In Spanish, Sra. Perez made fun of me because I couldn't speak properly and I had to bathe Mr. Singer in history. When I went to English, I couldn't find my homework and I got into big trouble. I had 2 double chemistry labs a week and it was just turning out to be the worst school year ever. Finally, I went to math one day and it was the same class I had freshman year, except it was in an English classroom. The big projector was down and all the lights were off. Everyone was having sex and Anthony and Lou were there and they wanted me to have sex. But I was scared, so I went home for Thanksgiving break. I was at Sue's house and I went through this door outside. I was on a big mountain. Lord Voldemort had returned and was eating Thanksgiving dinner with us. No one else knew it was him, and for some reason, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else. On the mountain were Ron and Hermione, and Sue and I were throwing turkey to them to save everyone. But behind them were a lot of other bad people, so we were trying to get rid of them without hurting Ron and Hermione. Finally Ron and Hermione got up the mountain, and Lord Voldemort walked right by us. Sue understood and we both left because we were scared. We went to the lake because we had to try to take a boat back to my high school. So we started carrying out boats to the shore and ran into Mrs. Carter, who told us that my high school had moved to France. We ignored her and kept walking with our boats to the shore. We got into the water except we weren't in the boats. There were little kids in the boats and Isabel and I had to safely get them across the lake to my high school and away from Lord Voldemort. There was a fish that grabbed onto me and when I shook it off, it started to have babies. Then a snapping turtle chased us to land. Then I woke up. (399 words)

I had a dream that I was at my high school, but it was just like Hogwarts and was magical. Professor Dumbledore was the headmaster. I had been going there before Kylie came too. So we dueled, and Dumbledore was on my side telling me what to do because my wand was messed up. Finally it snapped in half and we all had to go to Diagon Alley to buy a new wand. On the train Kylie made fun of me for being blonde, even though I'm not. So I got mad and then she cursed me to death. Then I woke up. (103 words)

I dreamed that I was sitting at one of the picnic benches at soccer camp and Aaron and I were discussing Anna Karenina and he had two of the characters mixed up or something and I was really frustrated with him because I knew I was right. I had the book and started to look it up. Just then my mother drove to pick me up and I left him. Then suddenly it was the first day of school. I was in the history wing and Ed was trying to show me something. He was pulling me somewhere and out of the middle of nowhere, Wyatt wanted to show me something different, so he began to pull me in the opposite direction. It was chaos because for some reason, it was also Parents Weekend. There were people everywhere. In the middle of everything, Gwenyth Paltrow was singing out of the blue. I was so exhausted; I finally went to my dorm. On the way, I met someone who gave me a pancake they wanted me to feed to the Maples' dog. I took a bite of the pancake and it was really good. When I was near the science building, the dog came out of nowhere and began to bite me. I was so angry and scared that I ran to my room in Houk. My room was completely deserted except for a queen-sized bed in the middle, the room with my Laura Ashley sheets on them. There was a secret passageway into my real room where Maria and Zoey were getting dressed. I realized that my clothes were too small, so I had to borrow some of Maria's hideous clothes. Andrea was there too. I finally went back to the main building only to realize that I had no schedule. I couldn't figure out what classes I had. I searched everywhere and went to my mailbox to find it. Jessica came to me and told me that the teachers were trying something different; on the first day of school everyone would just go to their classes whenever they wanted just to see if they liked them. I went to English and then to history. In history, Mr. Singer brought us down to the soccer field where there was a car race. He lay down in the middle of the field and began squirting mayonnaise all over the place. Then he started reciting a speech of Abraham Lincoln's. No one found this weird though. Then I woke up.

I dreamed that I was spending some vacation with Gianna. She was living in this humungous house and her dad was really rich and worked for NASA. In one room there were a lot of beds all lined up against the wall. People were lying on the beds, and each had on a pair of shin guards. Underneath their shin guards were their stories and how they had been injured and why they were lying on these beds. Whenever Gianna or I lifted the shin guards to read the story, however, they woke up and started laughing at us. Then they made some sarcastic comment that was supposed to be satirical and making fun of a movie. Gianna and I realized that we were on the set of Scary Movie 3, and that's why everyone was making satirical comments. When we got to the last bed, a woman leapt out of nowhere and grabbed the shin guards away from us. She asked us if we had tried them on, and we said no. She then told us that it was a pair of deadly shin guards, and that whoever tried them on died the next day. Gianna and I went back to the main part of her house where a lot of maids were cleaning the tile floor. We started to watch a DVD before her dad came in and told us he had to leave again. Gianna was really upset. He got into this enormous truck and began to back out of the driveway before he began to fly and took off into the stars. Gianna and I went into another room where there was a fruit snacks factory. A large pipe would deposit fruit snacks into bags in short intervals. The pipe had been clogged and everyone was trying to fix it. Then this dream ended and I began another one where I was in Paris. Some friends and I were walking down a small street and spotted a good-looking cafe. We went inside and it turned out to be a sort of cafe/ice cream parlor/bakery/candy shop. We all went inside and tried to decide what to have. They had some of the weirdest candy, like "Antique M&Ms," where there was fruit inside the chocolate part. I went to go buy an ice cream cone, a coffee, and iced tea. I spilled the coffee as soon as I got it. Not wanting to pay for another. I filled it up with water and complained that they had given me water instead of coffee. They refilled it for me, and then I woke up. (435 words)

I had a dream that I was running around the main building looking for Anthony. I finally went to the auditorium to find him. I saw someone who looked like him very much. It was his father. He told me that Anthony was nervous to be around me because he knew that I liked him and he liked me too. A few minutes later, Anthony appeared looking a bit surprised to see me. I asked him why we hadn't seen each other lately and he didn't answer me. He said he was going to get changed and we could go for a walk. We took a walk down to the English wing, trying to find comfortable chairs to sit in. We saw people in their English classes and for some reason this was weird because it was supposed to be summer or something. We got to the end of the English wing and saw that the chapel was dimly lit. We went inside and saw Faith playing the violin. She left immediately as soon as Anthony and I got there. But she left her metronome on. I went to turn it off. Built into the metronome was some sort of sprinkler; when I went to turn it off, I got soaked. I told Anthony I was going into the little chapel loft to get undressed/changed. I crawled up there and went to a pew in the back and began to peel off my soggy clothes. Then I saw Anthony's face near the staircase and he came up and helped me get out of my wet clothes. Then he kissed me and I woke up. Then I dreamed that I was playing soccer and James Franco was the referee. He kept talking to me and teasing me until the game was over. Then I woke up again. (306 words)

I dreamed that I was at soccer camp and we were all in the room where we watch movies. It was pitch black and we were all soaking wet from the rain. All the coaches were outside the room choosing courses for us next year. I was getting really frustrated because I wanted to choose my own classes. I didn't want someone choosing them for me. The door opened and a little light crept in. I realized I was alone. Aidan came in to tell me what he had chosen for me to take. I was really upset because I didn't want to take the courses he selected. (108 words)

I first had a dream that Valerie and I were in this great big house with Brody. We were playing some sort of board game. I think maybe somewhere on the game there were sexual references or something, because very soon he was assaulting us. Valerie and I ran as fast as we could through the house, but he kept following us. Finally, I took off my belt and tried to whack him with it. Nothing happened. Valerie and I ran out of the house and into Mrs. Carter, who drove us to another house. Aidan and Jason were there and they saved Valerie and me. Then I had a new dream that there was a wedding at Sue's house. Everyone was dressed like Drew Barrymore in Ever After. All the kids, though, were playing games in the living room. I went in, and Sue, My brother, Ian, Claire, and Wyatt were there. We all started chatting and coloring until Mr. Bailey came in and announced that we all had to exercise, or something. He made Wyatt do 100 push-ups. I sneaked out to put my dress on, but it had gone. Then I woke up. (196 words)

I dreamed that I was in the snack bar. Everyone in there was fast asleep, so I attempted to sleep too. I remember I was in between Lou and Albert. Lou and I were talking, and then he started to kiss me. I was annoyed because I was pretty sure that he didn't think he was kissing me. I pushed him away but he kept kissing me. Then I left and had to be Santa's elf or something and help build the sleigh. Lou began to get sick, so I have him some cheese to help him feel better. We finally finished the sleigh, and then I woke up. (109 words)

I had a dream that I was in the main building holding a key. I knew it was a key to get into one of the dorms, only on, the one I lived in. I walked out to Langton because it was closest and tried my luck there. The key opened the door and I was thrilled, until I saw about 100 boys draped all over the furniture. They told me that I didn't live there I was so scared I went back to the main building. I tried to figure out my schedule, which I didn't have, as usual. I can't really recall all the details, but I remember waking up and thinking that it was an "outrageous dream about school." (122 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#025 (08/03/2003 (age 14))

My first dream was that I was playing an ice hockey game and all my senior friends had come back to watch, like Aidan, Nick, Anthony, and others. I also remember other faces like Aaron. My stick kept switching from a lefty to a righty, and it was horribly frustrating. We won the game and after I got undressed and changed, I went to the stands to say hi to everyone. I started crying because I had missed them all so much. Then, all of a sudden, everyone disappeared except for Aidan. We sort of started walking towards each other, and then he started crying! And then he disappeared too! I was so sad. That night I went home and had to give this show about a horse. It was 1am and I was showing this horse. Then I saw Aidan crying. I ran to him in the room at soccer camp where we watch movies. He kept saying, "You don't understand," and then I woke up. (167 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#026 (08/04/2003 (age 14))

I had a dream that I was babysitting my brother and we were watching movies. We were watching the Star Wars trilogy. When it was over, he wanted to watch Pocahontas. We were in something I remember as a "public living room." Other people walked in and this one girl had a huge crush on my brother. When I was done babysitting him, I had to go babysit the Pike children in Post. When I was there, it started to snow. Mr. Pike got home as I was unloading the dishwasher. He paid me and let me go. Then school started. I had to go to a Spanish class that was somewhere else. I was packing my backpack to go, and all these people kept taking my stuff and pestering me, so it was impossible to pack. I must have woken up and then begun a new dream. I was one of the friends of the Culkin family. Also in this group was Aidan. We all got really drunk and started walking on this bridge, complaining how adults never understand kids. We were all planning for a surprise party or something...Aidan was meant to guard the door while we all set up. But then I woke up. (207 words)

I dreamed that I was attending soccer camp again. Hannah and Sue were there. We were all having so much fun and looking forward to the next weekend when we'd go to Hannah's house. It was then Friday and we were done with camp. We were all walking towards Hannah's car, when all the younger campers practically killed us by kicking their soccer balls at us. We loaded our bags into the car and went to Hannah's house. I remember us all showering when we got there. Then I wandered around the house into a beautiful Renaissance style living room where two people were having sex. It was really weird, so I left and then woke up. (117 words)

I dreamed that my father was having dinner with Matthew, Albert, and Anthony. They were going to a sleepover later. I wanted to shower before they arrived. Halfway through my shower, I thought I heard them, so I got out and went downstairs. For some reason, Camilia had come and wanted to shower too, so I let her shower while I watched TV. When she was done, I remembered that I hadn't conditioned my hair or anything, so I went back in. When I got out of the shower for the 2nd time, all the boys were there. They began rolling out sleeping bags and mattresses, preparing for the sleepover. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. This dream I can't remember exactly, except that Hannah, Sue, and I were mad at this other girl. (139 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#029 (08/07/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was at soccer camp again. Charles was one of my counselors and he kept teasing me, in a good way, I guess. Every time I tried to take a picture of him, he would duck or run away. I finally took one of him as we were walking indoors to eat lunch and watch the movie. Inside they were serving lunch (pizza and brownies) to us. Everyone kept saying, "It's OK, we have 2 hours before we have to run again. So I ate some. Then it got dark, as the movie was about to start. I started to fall asleep. When I woke up, everyone was unplugging the lamps. It was really weird, because it was already dark. Then I woke up. (127 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#030 (08/08/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that it was the end of the year and all the seniors were about to graduate. Sue and I were preparing for our exams. It was the night before graduating; so all the seniors were playing games while all the underclassmen were studying. I remember looking into a room and seeing Nick and another girl, which made me jealous. I forget what Nick said, but I left, furious. Sue and I didn't have the proper materials to study for the chemistry exam. We snuck into the science building to get the stuff. When we got there, there was some sort of leak or something, because the whole building was flooded and smelled awful. Sue and I grabbed buckets to carry everything. We swam through the hallways trying to find a light switch. We couldn't, so we returned to the main building. All the seniors were getting ready to leave, and I was so sad and flustered because I didn't think I would see any of them again. Then I saw Anthony and he hugged me and kissed me goodbye. Then I must have woken up and started another dream about The Da Vinci Code. I remember the albino monk, Silas, was trying to kill someone else, and I was trying to stop him. The man Silas was trying to kill came to me for help. He wanted me to disguise him. So I cut him a pair of jeans. I guess I thought that would disguise him. I kept waking up in the middle of the night though. (260 words)

I dreamed that it was the beginning of school. Even though I was supposed to be rooming with Hannah, I had to spend the first night of study hall with my old roommates, Zoey and Maria. I was really annoyed, but I knew that if I spent just one study hall with them, I never would have to again. I think it was probably nearing the end of study hall, because I was feeling really impatient to leave. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. In this dream, I was at this summer camp. Sue was there and we were having a lot of fun. On the last day, we had to board buses to get us home. One kid was frantically telling us that when we got on the bus, they were going to give us an oxygen mask because of the altitude. Only it was a gas mask and if we put it on, we would die. Sue and I got on and held our masks to our faces, pretending we had them on. We saw a lot of kids put them on and then "fall asleep." We closed our eyes to pretend. The bus stopped and everyone who was alive got out, while they cleaned all the dead bodies off. Sue and I stood outside the bus, crying. When we got back on, they were going to gas the whole bus. I just remember thinking, "This is it, no one will know I'm dead for a long time. I can never see my family or friends again." But just as we were about to board the bus again, a volcano erupted, causing everyone to scatter. I ran all the way home and then woke up. (292 words)

First I dreamed that my friends and I were all trying to help Matthew get into Yale. We were helping him with classes and applications. I think he ended up getting in, but then I started a new dream that was really weird. I had three bedrooms, and whenever I had to talk to someone, they always met me in the wrong room. My next dream was about taking exams. I dreamed that right before each exam in the morning, we all gathered in the dining hall and individually ordered French toast and bacon. The woman got angry because she didn't want to cook. I was slightly confused. My last dream was about this game. There were 20 people and 1 killer. Everyone is trying to find out who this one killer was before they died. They were all forming pacts and groups, just to be betrayed. It was really odd. Then I woke up. (155 words)

My first dream was that I was at a meeting for soccer preseason. All the seniors were talking about how much fun it was, and all the freshmen were looking really scared, but I wasn't. Then I started a new dream. I was in Bundy and Lou was in Owen. I really wanted to see him, but I needed an excuse to run over there. I saw someone delivering a pizza, so I decided I would sneak in when the pizza delivery guy went in. I scooted inside and went to my friend's room (can't remember who...) then I went looking for Lou. But it was Anthony I found. He kissed me and then I woke up. (117 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was at the Dunn's house and Sue, Hannah, Kim and I were all taking the SATs. We were all discussing our answers, which was apparently OK. When we were done, we left to go home. I lived somewhere else. We saw tollbooths and drove through them, but immediately after we entered, all the cars changed directions and they were heading towards us! Horrified, I turned the car around. Then for some reason, we were looking for Anthony to surprise him. He was living in Texas, and when we got down there, people were throwing sand at his house; however, this was considered a gesture or admiration or something like that. Then I started a new dream where Ed was having lunch. Weird. Then I woke up. (132 words)

I dreamed that my family and I went to McDonalds every meal. All my friends did too. It was like school, or something, everyone went there everyday with his or her families. The McDonalds was owned by a really sweet man, so when he one day raised the prices, I didn't mind. Soon everything was really expensive, and we stopped going there. My next dream was that someone was trying to kill me. I wasn't being chased or anything like that, but someone was trying to kill me. When I was asleep (in my dream), Lou came into my room. He started crying, and when I woke up he told me that he was the one who was trying to kill me. Then I was at the Lincoln Memorial and it was burning down. Then I woke up in real life. (141 words)

I first dreamed that Sue, Lou, Tristan, and I were all in math class with Mr. Stipps again. We were all trying to find out this one problem, but it was nearly impossible. It was so frustrating. I guess Isabel and I finally gave up, or we figured it out or something, because we eventually left. We went to check our mail. I tried to open my mailbox, but it wouldn't open. I kept trying to open it, but it would just not open. Then Sue and I saw Mel Gibson coming to check his mail (at my high school for some reason...) and he laughed at us because we couldn't open mine. I then started a new dream where my family and I were driving somewhere. We were just driving along the hallway when, all of a sudden, I noticed no one was in the driver's seat. I felt really worried and tried to steer from the back seat. It was really difficult, and I ended up skidding off the road. My last dream was the best! It started badly though. I came home to find all the kids from the local high school having a party. Kylie was throwing the party, and I was really angry. Apparently my house was attached to one of the dorms by a long hallway. So everyone kept running back forth stealing stuff from the dorm rooms. Kylie found this tiny object that was like a kaleidoscope in the shape of a rock. It was brightly colored and she let me look at it. I looked through it and was surprised to see pictures of Anthony, waving, smiling, playing, laughing, reading, etc. I realized that this was the graduation present his parents had given him that he had been waiting to open. I was furious with Kylie for stealing it. I called Anthony and we started chatting and laughing. I kept walking through the hallway to Post, where Anthony lived, but Kylie kept running after me. She wanted the kaleidoscope because she thought Anthony was cute and wanted an excuse to talk to him. I got really mad and tried talking to Anthony through post-it notes. It was really weird. I kept talking to him and then he invited me to his room. He was teasing me crawled on top of me when I sat on his bed. He saw that I had his kaleidoscope and was so happy that he kissed me! Then I woke up. (414 words)

I dreamed that Charla and I were walking through the athletic center and we passed the boys' locker room. The doors were wide open and we could see all the boys inside. We went inside and started talking to them. For some reason, going into the boys' locker room was against the law, and Charla and I knew this, but we kept talking to all the boys (in their towels, by the way). Suddenly, Mrs. Carter pulled us away and began lecturing us about how wrong it was to go into the boys' locker room. I soon fell asleep and had a dream within a dream. This dream was about shopping. I was in Costco shopping for food to keep into my dorm room at school, but then I got lost. I woke up and Mrs. Carter was still lecturing me. Then I really woke up in real life. (149 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#038 (08/18/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was taking Ancient Civilizations again with Mr. Bailey. I was re-writing an essay and I kept trying to email it to him, but it just wouldn't work. I kept getting the email returned to me. Frustrated, I went back to Bundy to see Hannah. It was snowing and all the heaters had broken up, so Katie and I huddled under our comforters, reading. We talked for a while before going to the main building to get dinner. On the way, I saw Matthew. I really wanted to talk to him, but was too shy. Hannah told me to just go up to him and say "hi," so I did and he picked me up and twirled me around. He laughed, put me down, and started walking away. Hannah yelled across the hallway, "See, Bea! It's so easy to talk to guys! I told you!" I was embarrassed, but luckily Matthew didn't her. Julian, however, did. He began to laugh, but he didn't care. We went to the dining hall and saw Caroline and Sue. They were getting rice and singing the Goo Goo Dolls. Then I woke up. (192 words)

Bea 1: a high school student:#040 (08/21/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed first that Sue and Hannah and I were all in Poland. We were walking around my high school (in Poland) and saw Angelina at the auditorium. We all went in to watch a movie. Then, I dreamed that my father was up against 6 saber-toothed tigers, and that he defeated them all. Reporters from ESPN wanted to interview him. He kept saying things like, "I'm da man," "Who's your daddy?," and "I'm in da house!" My last dream was that Hannibal Lecter kidnapped me and he wanted to kill me. Then I woke up. (96 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#041 (08/23/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was running away from someone...but I can't remember exactly who it was. Then I was at soccer camp again and it was my birthday. I got to pick out a stuffed animal from a bag. Jon was there and had given me a Tiffany heart charm bracelet with my name engraved on it. Aidan had bought me dinner. The best part, though, was Anthony pushing through the crowd and taking me on a date to a swimming pool. We swam around all night and it was really warm. HE would lift me and carry me on his shoulders around in the water, all the while rubbing his hands across my skin. Then I started a new dream that my brother and I were in the library and we were standing in front of the Mona Lisa. Then I woke up. (144 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#042 (08/25/2003 (age 14))

I first dreamed that I was in Florence, because that is where my parents were getting married (weird). Either I was really sick or sad, because someone gave me a huge cake. I remember falling asleep in my dream and being awoken to crashing noises and explosions. I looked out my window, and people were running and screaming everywhere. It was weird though; they were all celebrating for something, rather than screaming about something bad. I was frustrated because I couldn't find anyone I knew and I had no idea what everyone was screaming about. Then I must have begun a new dream because all of a sudden I was at the spring carnival. Everyone was having a lot of fun as usual --Jello-wrestling, slip-and-sliding, and everything else --I can't remember a lot of details, but then everyone went to the dining hall. I was eating strawberries with sugar. Across the dining hall, Leah was strutting around on a table. She got embarrassed and tried to make it a joke, but no one laughed. Then I woke up. (178 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#043 (08/28/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was at the beach and was swimming against Rachel. I had to swim from one dock to another, so I dove in and touched the bottom. Immediately, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I struggled to the surface, feeling the pressure on my lungs. It was really scary and I kept pushing upward. Finally I reached the surface and gulped air in. I was breathing really hard in real life and woke myself up for a second. Then when I fell back asleep I was walking home from the beach in my comforter. I was so tired I could barely stand up. It started raining and this little boy appeared carrying an umbrella and he kept me dry. When I got to my house, I asked him his name. It was Colin. So I got home and Kylie called asking me to help her on her math placement exam. I really didn't want to, but she kept begging me, so I couldn't just hang up. So then Sue drove up and asked me if I wanted to go with her to the mall and then to the movies. I really wanted to go with her, but Kulie wouldn't stop bugging me, so Sue drove off. I was really mad. Then the power went out and I couldn't turn my computer on. (225 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#044 (08/30/2003 (age 14))

Last night I had a very odd dream that there was this huge concert on the quad. There was a stage, a crowd, and everything. It was right in the beginning of the year, so everyone was really excited and energetic. I was sitting next to Gianna and we got called up on stage. When we got there, it started to shake uncontrollably, like some kind of trampoline. Everyone was laughing and cheering as we struggled to stay upright. We finally got off and walked inside Langton so I could go to the bathroom. I saw Lou and Ariana washing dishes. They had just seen my "performance" and were being really critical of it. Ariana said that when she saw me, she wanted to vomit. Lou laughed and then --to my horror --agreed. He was going out with Vanessa, and Ariana was discussing that now with Lou. I ran to the other end of the dorm and began to cry. I hated him for agreeing with Ariana, and I hated myself for liking him. On the opposite end of the hall was a movie theater. I went inside to watch Finding Nemo. There was a guy with flowers waiting for me; he was oddly reminiscent of Anthony. We began to chat and laugh, and soon Lou was out of my mind. When the movie was over, we walked out of Langton to find the campus deserted. We entered another dorm to find lots of people crammed inside. All the students were doing ridiculous chores and exercises as punishment from the teachers for having the huge concert. We ran out and into another dorm to avoid being caught and made to mow the grass with our teeth, or duel each other with umbrellas. We ran upstairs to my room. We could hear a teacher frantically pursuing us. I had the topmost loft as my room, only accessible by a leader, which unfortunately had been shattered. We tried in vain to climb up, but it was useless. We were caught and led downstairs where we were forced to drive metal pegs into the ground. Then I woke up. (356 words)

I dreamed that I belonged to this very prestigious book club. Pauline was there and so was Brenda. We were all discussing a book we had just read. All of a sudden, the floor turned to ice. We were in a huge mansion, and all the oriental rugs were turned to ice. Then the ice started to crack and all the chairs fell through to the freezing water below. I was so scared, but then I woke up. (78 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#046 (09/02/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was on some trip somewhere and I was driving a huge coach bus with all my friends in it. Since I was driving, I was the one who decided where we stop for bathroom breaks and stuff. No one could agree with me about when and where to stop though, so I became frustrated and finally stopped at a rest area. I saw a little boy who looked lost. He spoke Spanish, so I said, "Donde es el coche?" (Where is your car?) But then I remembered that I had to use estar instead of ser. So I corrected myself and said "Donde esta; el coche?" A man nearby told me that the only way the little boy would find his way home is if I brought him to the church at the end of the mall at the rest area. I asked, "Donde esta la iglesia?" A woman told me she would lead me there. So I picked the little boy up and walked behind the woman. On the way I saw Ava; she had been shopping. She showed me a black tank top she had bought from Express. She asked if I wanted to borrow any of her money to shop, but I said no. Then I woke up. (215 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#047 (09/03/2003 (age 14))

I had this horrible dream that we were playing a hockey game. Our third line (my line) was completely out of it, and we just couldn't play. One girl was missing from the first line, so Chloe moved me up to play with them --big mistake! They were much faster and more skilled than I. I would try to pass the puck, and they'd be gone from the space I'd passed to. I couldn't position myself correctly because they would always skate away. Finally the game ended; we had won, and Chloe and Mrs. Carter were thrilled. Everyone then left and I was alone on the bench. Then all the lights went out. I began to take off my equipment right then and there. Doing so, I managed to lose my gloves, pants, and skates. When I finally had put what was remaining of my equipment into my bag, I assumed that my skates had somehow magically been transported to the locker room. I must have started a new dream, because next thing I know I am talking to Anthony. And it's weird because I know somewhere in the back of my mind that he's dead. But I kept talking to him. I was so sad because he was dead. But then I woke up. (215 words)

When I got there, there was an itinerary that told me when I would be getting my teeth pulled out. I wasn't aware of this and was thoroughly frightened.

I had a really gory dream last night. Sue and I worked for the CIA and we both had some special 6th sense. The CIA would tell us general areas where someone had been murdered, and we would have to go scout around for either the murderer or the dead body. It was really scary because the killer could be anywhere, and Sue and I were the only ones who could see the body. We had special equipment and everything. It was traumatizing to see the bodies. I remember seeing the lower half of a body with knives stuck in the legs. It was horrible. Thank God I woke up! (110 words)

Last night I dreamed that everyone was in the auditorium and we all had to get up if we had ever done drama before. I was the only one not to get up. Then we all had to tell our most embarrassing moments. It was finally my turn and I began to say that I often tripped a lot in the always, when I realized no one was listening. My mother stood up and told everyone to be quiet and listen to my most embarrassing moment --how ironic, as that would easily be my most embarrassing moment. I was horrified and stormed out of the auditorium. I want to check my mailbox and the new Facebook was there. I went upstairs and there was a database there that recorded all the hookups in the entire school. Then I woke up. (140 words)

I dreamed that I was in the main building and I was making out with someone. I felt kind of awkward about doing that in public, so I left to go to lunch. For some reason, it was graduation tomorrow. I was astounded. Where did the whole year go? I felt like it had just been fall, and now all of a sudden it was graduation? I saw the seniors packing their bags and loading them into their cars. I began to cry so hard because I had not spent enough time with everyone. After graduation, I was playing hockey, when I should have been studying for exams. I went back to the library and Hannah and Sue were there. Albert came back from Spain and told us he had moved to the ocean. Then I had to think about college!?! Thank god I woke up! (146 words)

I had so many dreams last night! The first dream was that during study hall, I was abused. From 7:30-8:00 I could work and study, but then at 8, I had to strip down to my underwear and go into a cell where it was wet and freezing cold. I was abused and hurt or an hour and a half and I was furious because I didn't even know why. I hated it! Then I had a dream that my family and I were all going on a trip to Sea World. My brother and I sat in the splash section, and then left hurriedly. On the way home, we were playing in the sand, trying to set up some sort of box. We got sand in our eyes and rushed to wash it out with the ocean water. Our eyes really burned then from the salt and the sand. Then Hannah and I were walking back from lunch or something to Bundy. The seniors were all trying to yank each other's pants off to embarrass one another. When Hannah and I got to the dorm, we had emails from all of them saying something bad was going to happen. Anyway, then I had a dream about Counting Crows, that I was going to see them. Then I woke up. (220 words)

I dreamed that I was in the main building and I was wearing my angel costume. Lou started chasing me because he wanted to take my wings. He finally caught up with me and took them. Then I began to chase him through the hallways. He ran upstairs to the little quad of chairs outside of the history wing. I cornered him and he collapsed onto one of the couches. I began to tickle him to get my wings back. He was very ticklish and was squirming uncontrollably. Eventually, he dropped my wings. When I bent over to pick them up, he grabbed me and pushed me onto the chair. He then began to tickle me. I was breathing so hard. I begged him to stop, and he finally did. Then he leaned down to kiss me. All of a sudden it was a new dream. The science building was attached to the main building through a long, tall staircase right near the yearbook room. I remember having to go to the yearbook room to layout some more pages. Then I woke up. (183 words)

Anna and I were trying to figure out when we had practice. I kept falling over and falling asleep throughout the main building and around the athletic center because I was so tired. I told Charla she needed to get Jay to ask him something about our class. So he came over and tried to wake me up. I felt so weak. I only woke up when Lou came to get me. We then walked to the Sistine Chapel to find out when we had practice, but there were so many staircases that I couldn't find where to go. Then I was in front of the dorms. Then I woke up.

But I couldn't climb up onto the ships. But I couldn't climb up. Anyway, then I was in the dining hall, sitting at the senior boys' table. Ed was there. We went outside and walked around and talked about love. When we got inside, all the senior boys were doing some sort of race on the ramp. I went to go watch and Lou was up. After he went, he grabbed my hand and yanked me away from the crowd. My mother had booked a makeover for me, but I didn't really want one. Then I woke up. (136 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#075 (11/18/2003 (age 15))

So first I dreamed that I was at my high school and it was the last day of this year. All these guys were asking me out. Then I was at college in California. It was the kind of college where if you went to my high school, you immediately went to this college. Then there were other kids from other schools there as well. It was really dangerous. We had to cross 6 roads all next to each other to get to the school. The last 2 were these horribly steep and narrow staircases where people would skateboard. I was walking down them and the skateboarders couldn't see us. So I was especially scared. I finally got to my dorm and all my friends were going skating. They all left and I changed and put sunscreen on. Andrea and Camilia were there and they wanted to know if my boyfriends at my high school had made me any more comfortable with dating in college. I guess I kind of blew them off, because next thing I know, I am at the beach. It started to rain, so I had to go back to school. I was so sad when I looked at all these pictures of my high school friends and realized how much I missed them. I was in English with a lot of the freshmen, and Ms. Williams came in and announced we were having the school play that day. Everyone was really excited, except me, because it was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays were my best days, so I would have to miss my favorite classes. We had 30 minutes before we had to be in the auditorium. I went looking for my friends. Sue was giving a tour. Gianna and her brother were up in the math wing. I started walking to the dining hall. Gabby was in the senior quad and she started making fun of me because I always looked shy. Beside her was a shelf of books. They were all fictional love stories. Then I woke up. (344 words)

I dreamed that I was at school. Hannah and I were all in the library studying for exams. Neo, from The Matrix, was there getting us to try different kinds of jellybeans. All of a sudden, we were back in the dorm. Sue was showering and Hannah and I were in our room eating Cape Cod chips. When Sue came in, the fire alarm went off. We all had to get out of the building. The sprinklers went off. So then I had a new dream that I was at Audrey's house and Pauline was getting married. Audrey wanted me to ride Pauline's horse into the woods to find the rest of our relatives. When I got on the horse, he started talking to me. Then I woke up. (129 words)

Bea 1: a high school student:#079 (12/16/2003 (age 15))

I had a horrible dream last night! First, Lord Voldemort was after me and I couldn't hide from him. I tried to run outside my house in the woods. He heard me and went back inside to get a flashlight for some reason. Then I ran up by the Links' house and Mr. Links came back with his flashlight. He found me, so I made a deal with him that if he stopped killing everyone else, he could kill me. It was so scary. Then I had a dream that we bought a new dog crate, not even a new dog, but just a new crate. It was a huge deal for some reason. I couldn't understand why everyone was so worked up, but whatever. So that ended and then I dreamed that it was exam time again at school. The new policy was that you could either take the exam in the classes you were taking, or you could pick up a new class and take that exam. So I decided to pick up dance and take that exam --it was a lot of fun! But ever since I had picked it up and had to dance with Julian, Lou stopped talking to me. It was unbearable and I couldn't understand why he was ignoring me. So for the exam, I had to have sex with Julian. I was really reluctant to do this, but I was guaranteed an A in the class and that I wouldn't even remember having sex with him, so I did. But the next morning, I was really sore and I did remember everything. Lou came up behind me and started flirting with me again, and I was so happy he wasn't ignoring me. I ran up to him and tried to hug him. Then he pushed me away, and I was really confused. I asked him what his problem was, and he said something to the effect of, "At least I didn't sleep with someone to get a good grade. I don't want you sleeping with other boys." I guess it was cute that he cared, but it was horrible having him mad at me! (362 words)

My first dream was that it was exam time and I had taken every exam except for Spanish. For Spanish, I had to clone people. Jackson was right in front of me doing the same thing. The clones came from every room, and it was impossible to keep track of them. Finally, Sra. Perez said we had made enough and that we could leave. I had had a lot of feelings towards Jackson lately. He brought me into Tinker into an empty room. We weren't doing anything except kissing, but the whole time in there felt really sexual. He had his shirt off or something, but it felt like we were doing more than just kissing, even though we weren't Anyway, we were there for awhile before the person who lived there came back and kicked us out. We were holding hands as we left. We went to the library to start studying for another exam, which was weird since we were done with our exams. Then we had Fun Friday. It was the weirdest one ever, but it was everyone's favorite. There was a monster onstage plus 3 students. The monster could see one person, but not the other two. We all had to kill the monster, but the more people that came on stage, the more the monster could see us. He could also hear us. I remember looking at my watch and realizing an hour had gone by. Then I woke up. (245 words)

I dreamed that I had bought the brand new Synergy hockey stick, and I couldn't wait to use it. There was a pick up hockey game some winter night when we were getting snowed in. When I picked up, however, I realized that I had bought a righty instead of a lefty. I was so disappointed at myself for my foolish mistake. No matter how hard I tried, the stick stayed righty. All the other girls laughed at me. Then I started a new dream that was at my brother's 2nd grade parent-teacher conferences. I was really bored and kept falling asleep until the teacher used me as an example of the student who had perfectly gotten through elementary and middle school, and that I was doing excellent now as well. Then another woman engaged me in a conversation about Pirates of the Caribbean but I fell asleep (in my dream). Then I woke up in real life. (158 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#082 (12/25/2003 (age 15))

I dreamed that I was PERFECT in every way: looks, sports, brains, personality, talent, etc. I was perfect. So I was running around with this really tall, dark, handsome guy. We were by the ocean and he said he'd love me forever. Then I realized I was just a character for a John Updike story, so I was really scared and wanted to see the ending, but I was woken up instead for Christmas. (74 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#083 (12/27/2003 (age 15))

First I dreamed that I was babysitting Layla. I was trying to do everything perfectly since her dad was my soccer coach. We went to the ocean and came back to her house to bake cookies. We were just rolling out the dough when her mom came back and paid me. Next, I was in some really fancy modern Japanese-style house. Every time I finished a homework assignment, I was allowed to get up and get a piece of candy. The thing was --the assignments never seemed to end. No sooner would I finish one then I would have another one. Finally it was study hall and I was working with Ava, Isaiah, and Beth. It was weird because I think Isaiah liked me. Then I woke up.

Bea 1: a high school student:#084 (12/28/2003 (age 15))

I dreamed that there was some sort of Olympics at school. There were 3 big events. Halfway through one I ran to Taylor for some reason just to hang out, I guess. Next day I was watching the real Olympics. I realized I had hockey practice, so I ran to Bundy to get ready. I was really panicked because I couldn't find my watch or something. When I got there, someone had died. We had this huge underclassmen funeral. Then I was in a department store of some sort. Someone else was with me and there were these two sort of scary-looking men, who wanted to buy us jewelry. We found two pairs of earrings we liked, and they went to buy them for us. The woman at the counter said they were Tiffany earrings, but somehow I couldn't believe her. There were 3 little dogs there too and they were yapping all over the place. So then I was at Hogwarts. Professor Snape was looking all over the place for me. I accidentally set off a charm that made all these bombs explode. The whole school rushed into the hallways. We had to bring as much money outside as possible. It was freezing outside. But then I woke up. (210 words)

I dreamed that Jackson and I were on a bus on the way home from my elementary school. He jumped out of the bus to run to my house. It was pouring rain, so we had to change into dry clothes. I was changing when he walked in and saw me. I wasn't embarrassed, for some reason. But there was something I was trying to hide in my closet, so I was worried that he would find it. Then I woke up.

I dreamed that I was back in 8th grade and had to make a poster about the solar system. So I made it and brought it into school. The presentations were held in the lunchroom. The presentations started and I realized how inadequate my work was. So I shifted my posters around until I found the best one I had made about the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. I used that and presented, and did very well. Then I had some dream about Jackson, that I was talking to him through a wall. I also dreamed I woke up next to him. Then I woke up. (106 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#088 (01/01/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that my brother and I were electricians of some sort and had to install TVs into houses/trailers in a trailer park. It was scary because the trailer park was next to a chemical plant, so it was always releasing chemicals and other horrible things into the air. And it was really loud. The trailer we were working on was constructed like an airplane. My brother and I tried to figure out how to fly it, but couldn't. So then I dreamed it was exam period. I had an 8am math exam, but for some reason instead of going to the classroom, I went to the movie theater to see Love Actually. This didn't seem at all weird though. Caroline went in and told me she'd save me a seat while I went to get ice cream. I wanted Butterscotch ice cream, and there was only one vendor that had it. My mother was in the line ahead of me. As soon as it was my turn, the woman closed everything up. I was really annoyed and went upstairs. All these junior and senior boys I didn't know were there. I really wanted this butterscotch ice cream, but no one had it. Instead I just had some diet coke. Everyone was leaving the movie theater, so I guess I missed the movie. I found my friends and realized that my dress had fallen off. I left hurriedly, thinking it was just a trick of my mind, hoping it was just a trick of my mind. I saw Lou walking out of the dining all. He was carrying something and his hair was really short. I noticed he was wearing these terrible looking shoes, and I decided that I should stop liking him for that reason. I went back to my friends and all of a sudden I was looking into a deep abyss, like where Mordor is in Lord of the Rings. I ran away as fast as I could and ran into my math teacher, who noticed I had missed the exam! Thank god I woke up! (349 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#089 (01/02/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that Sue and I were in a car together. Isabel called our Spain program to see if she got in. They said she had. So then I called to ask if I got in, and they said I hadn't, but that there was a program in Russia if I was interested. For some reason if I wanted to go to Russia, I had to learn Latin, which wouldn't have been so bad. I remember telling myself that this was a dream and waking myself up. (87 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#090 (01/03/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that I owned this "salty bar" with Granddaddy right next to the ocean. One day, the whole school had to sail over to China to hear some sort of lecture. I missed the boat and had to swim over. I had brought a plate of Brie, but it was filled with poisonous crabs from my trip over. I dropped the dish when I got on land, and was terrified that they would poison me. But then I told myself that this was a dream, so I kept on walking to the lecture. When I got there, it was more like SNL than a serious lecture. I couldn't understand why we'd had to travel that whole way for this. I was sitting on the stage and could see Jackson right in front of me. The lecture ended 3 hours early. The deans said we had to remain there for the next 3 hours before going back. Vanessa started whining but then everyone made fun of her, so that was OK. Then Jackson looked at me and said he loved me and I woke up. (185 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#091 (01/04/2004 (age 15))

I first dreamed that my dean and I were best friends and I always went to his house to hang out. It was weird. Then I dreamed that Charla and I were in New Hampshire at Granddaddy's, and she wanted to take a boat on the lake at night. I knew it was a bad idea, but I went out with her anyway. We were 20 feet out into the water when I decided to turn back, because I knew this was wrong. My father had been sitting on the dock the whole time, and was proud that I had turned back. Then I dreamed that Sue and I were doing track. We finished with our warm up and this guy came up to talk to me. He was cute, sort of looked like Dylan and Nicholas put together. We were talking and flirting, and then all of a sudden, we were back at my house. He was flirting with me while we watched a movie. His name was Kevin Laradin, which is a name I've never heard or read before. Then I woke up. (185 words)

I had the worst dream ever. I dreamed that I was at some sort of camp, but it was military/boot camp. We were running laps around the track until I thought I was going to be sick. Then I got news that both my mother and father had died. I freaked out. But the guy kept making me run more laps. So then I threw up and I told myself that this had to be a dream. But I couldn't wake myself up. So then we had to sail down this river. But my boat got lost and I had to swim against the current. Thank god I woke up. (110 words)

I dreamed that we had a holiday, so everyone was in the main building. It was really boring, however, and no one was doing anything. Everyone, including the boys, was wearing pants and a bra. It was weird. So then Kim and Sue went to Sue's house. I remember seeing Kevin and Nicholas and Hannah in Bundy. A girl on the first floor was trying to go to sleep and told me to go to bed too. But I couldn't think about sleep. But then when I concentrated really hard, it sort of worked. Then I was talking online and Sue and Kim were soaked because it was raining. I was asking Aidan if I could sleep in his room, since I couldn't here. He laughed and said yes. Then I woke up. (133 words)

I dreamed first that I was in this huge mansion and I had to help deliver all these babies. All the women having the babies had to go up all these stairs though. Then I had to help them down the stairs to the delivery room. So then I was a slave in some huge landowner's house and I was running away with a baby in my little green Oshkosh overalls from when I was a baby. So we stole this food and other things we would need and put them in Bloomingdales bags. As soon as we left the house, the woman came after as, so we hid under a bench. I prayed she wouldn't see us or hear us breathing. The next dream I had --I was in the library trying to steal something heavily guarded by giant squids. It was impossible and I was really frustrated. The library was like a planetarium, so I lay down and looked up at all the stars in the ceiling. Then I had to go to Spanish class. Then I woke up.

Bea 1: a high school student:#105 (02/07/2004 (age 15))

I first dreamed that I was in the chapel, which was huge. Lou was next to me and I remember hearing the organ music from above. All of a sudden, I was in my bedroom. My friends and I were flying mattresses outside my window. There was tundra and icy cold water beneath us, so we didn't want to fall in. First it was just Sue and I, so it was easy to balance. Then more of our friends wanted to join us, but we weren't sure if the mattress could hold all of us. So Sue took a rope and attached it to the mattress and swam through the air. We were all fine. Then I realized that we didn't have our wings, and we all started falling. We landed hard in some military school. We ran away. So then I was at school in the snack bar. I ordered a blueberry muffin and ate it outside. I saw Caleb reading something and he called me over to lie down with him. I lay down and he put his book down. He wrapped his arm around me and held my hand with his free hand underneath his chin. He blinked and I could feel his eyelashes on my forehead. Our lips were touching, but we weren't kissing. I was worried about my breath. He started breathing a little harder and pulled me closer. Then I saw my mother and father, but they didn't see me. And then I woke up. (251 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#106 (02/08/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that we were having Martin Luther King Jr. Day in a huge stadium, like Madison Square Garden. One of our all school sessions had just finished, so we were all leaving. I saw Jackson and we did our little smiling thing. I made the sign that I would call him. So then I was doing laundry in the mailroom and I ran out of quarters. I finally found some and put them in the slot. I remember being very confused as to how to do my laundry. Then we had to go back to the auditorium and all watch a movie. It was the freshmen class doing a skit about how much they hated Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Weird...then there was this woman who looked like Mary Poppins. She had a butterfly costume on and was asking this man in the audience to marry her. He said he would do anything but marry her. Then she flew off with the rest of the butterflies. Then someone shot her down. A boy ran to her fallen body and opened up her wings. They were beautiful. I took them and left the auditorium away from everyone else. A little girl ran up behind me and tried to take the wings. They ripped a little bit, but I gave them to her. I was yelled at for this. I went to shower and realized that one of my shoes was gone. I went to the locker room and looked for it. But it wasn't there. So I never found it, but I remember seeing the boys going to soccer practice. (270 words)

Then my mother, brother, and I all had to go on some trip. A spider crawled out of my brother's backpack and he threw a huge fit. We all walked into a grocery store to buy snacks. I wanted to get juice boxes in the store and my mother got really upset. She bought my brother chips. Then she remembered that she had left something important at home. So we had to leave. Then I was in the auditorium and it was snowing and everyone was dancing. Then I woke up. (122 words)

I dreamed that James Bond lived in my basement and was having a huge party. There were 6 bars, strippers, gamblers, kegs, and lots of music and everything. I went down there and people were playing card games. But the people weren't real. I guess I just asked why the people weren't real. Someone told me that James Bond was impersonal. So the fake people represented the superficiality of them. I went back upstairs. Then I was trying to watch a movie, but my brother and Wyatt were shooting hockey pucks all over the place and I couldn't do whatever it was I wanted to do. I was really frustrated. Granddaddy was making cereal for a present for me. (119 words)

And there were all these incredible Alexander Calder mobiles around. The place was huge, no matter where you turned there were more rooms or stairs. There were several libraries, small rooms, kitchens, ballrooms, pools, everything. Lou kept trying to take my wings. Then I had to buy shoes or something. Then I woke up. (90 words)

I dreamed first that I was riding back from a hockey game with Caleb. We were cuddling and just sitting next to each other. Then when we got back to school, Caleb was going to go with the Varsity Girls team to their game. I was kind of upset and volunteered to drive the bus to the game so that I could be with him. Then I realized that I didn't know how to drive. The bus keeled over and Matthew came to save us. At the hockey rink, Lou was tickling me and flirting with me, and he hurt his back. I traveled to the hospital in the ambulance with him, and kissed his chest over and over again, hoping that would help in some way. Then I was just so mad about Caleb that I kept throwing things around and stomping on them. I was in a rage because he had ditched me earlier. Then I woke up. (160 words)

I dreamed that I was in this huge dark house with a random scary guy. I had my laptop with me and was trying to shut it down. I remember wanting to go home really badly but I couldn't until my laptop shut down. The big scary random guy kept coming on to me and trying to get me to take my clothes off. He was trying to rape me, and I was really scared. So I tried to call my father, but all the numbers on the phone had been rearranged, so I couldn't figure it out. The guy was chasing after me, telling me that he was just fooling around. I started to cry, and finally I was able to call home. But I didn't know where I was! My father kept asking me where he should pick me up, and all I could say was that I was somewhere in the mountains. It was awful. The guy caught me and hung the phone up. But then Caleb came in and hit the guy and saved me. He brought me to his car and we drove for a long time. We finally got to a motel type place attached to school. Hugh started making fun of me, and I hit him square in the chest. He grabbed my hand and pulled me really close to him. Our foreheads were touching and we were about to kiss, but I was still so upset about that scary guy that I ran away. I ran into Mr. Lopez, who tried assigning me more geometry homework. I tried to do it, but it was really difficult. Everyone around me kept trying to mess me up, so I was running away, holding onto my geometry homework. Then I woke up. (297 words)

I first dreamed that I was in chemistry, when I realized my entire schedule had changed. I was in none of the same classes, but my entire schedule was somehow filled up. I had the opposite lunch period from all my friends, and Billy Joel was my college advisor. Then I was in my room sorting my bras, and I couldn't find the white one I was looking for. Then, I dreamed that I was sailing in the pool. There were 3 different kinds of boats, and I didn't know which one to use, so I asked Caleb. Pete, Sam, and some other guys kept trying to listen, so Caleb waited until they went away so he could tell me which boat to use. I distinctly remember putting my hand up to cover my mouth, even though he was the one who was whispering. Our mouths were really close again, but we pulled away before anything happened, I guess. Next, I was at some swim meet and there were bookshelves lined up for bleachers. They were really narrow, so I kept falling off onto the pool deck. People laughed at me when I fell. Mason and Isaiah were sitting on the bookshelf with me and they finally fell too when the whole thing toppled into the water. Then I lived in this house of grime. I lived right next to some huge factory, so all the dirt, grime, smoke, and ash from the factory made a film over my house. It was really disgusting. Then I woke up. (258 words)

I dreamed that my skin was absolutely covered in these awful boils. They were crusty and pussy and just everywhere. I couldn't wear anything because clothes irritated my skin too much. But I had to get to class by the time my Harry Potter tape finished. So I was rushing around trying to find a tank top to wear. When I got to school, it was like a bar. The lights were dim and there was cigarette smoke everywhere. My father and I looked at a Patagonia catalog, trying to find clothes that wouldn't bother my boils. I woke up scratching myself to try and make them go away, and was SO happy when I didn't actually have boils! (119 words)

I had a dream that there was a formal dance in the library, which was 8 floors. I was walking back with someone, and I guess I had a date to this dance, but I think I still needed a dress and shoes. Then it was the beginning of the year because we were all moving into Bundy again. Hannah had totally changed the room around. Then we were in the dining hall eating really good French toast. Sue was eating raisin bran. We wondered if when we were juniors we would change seats in the dining hall. I wanted more French toast, but they had run out of syrup. I had to pack my laptop up to get more. On the way, I saw Kevin dressed as a huge bug. He said, "Hi, Bea," and I said, "Nice antennae." So then I went back to my seat and all last year's seniors were back. I tried to get the syrup, but they were taking it all. So then Sue and Charla and I were supposed to meet up later, but I woke up. (184 words)

I dreamed that I went to a party at Tim's house; however, none of my friends were there. So then I went to Drivers Ed and they were all there. We had to play all these games to help us learn how to drive. Hugh was there and he kept poking me and then saying, "You can never be my girlfriend because you can't drive yet." Weird. So then I dreamed that it was spring carnival again and we were all Jello-wrestling. I wanted to do my laundry so I wouldn't be wearing my sticky clothes. But apparently the laundry service put your dirty clothes in bags and never washed them. Then I woke up. (115 words)

I dreamed that Johnny Depp was in the hospital and I wanted to see him. So I devised a way to pretend that one of my relatives was in the same hospital room so that I could have an excuse to see him. He had changed his appearance, accent, and everything about him, however, so that when I got to the hospital, I couldn't tell who he was. I forget who, but someone I knew ended up in the same room as this dark Transylvanian guy, who ended up being Johnny Depp. I went in the room and was about to start talking to him when the entire hospital was about to collapse. I remember seeing Caleb and Alexis and knowing that I had to save them, but then I woke up. (132 words)

I dreamed that I was in Post, but instead of looking for Caleb, I was looking for Bud. I saw him sleeping in his room and I guess he must have looked really hot, because all of a sudden, I started liking him. Then I was taking a Spanish quiz with some other kids in my class, and we were on a raft in the middle of some bay. An alligator kept dragging us into the water and when one of us would try to save the other, the alligator would grab us. So then I was in the parking lot of CVS in a huge black suburban. I wasn't supposed to be out late at night and was horrified to see my father, because he would probably yell at me for being out past my curfew. I tried to drive away, but realized that I couldn't drive. I ran Freddie Prinze Jr. over on my way home. I was horrified, but apparently he was OK. He said really sarcastically, "Thanks, Bea. Thanks a lot." I was so happy that he knew my name, but sad that I had run him over! (192 words)

I dreamed that I lived in Manhattan. So one night I was showering and had to go get something. When I was going back to finish my shower, a man jumped out and tried to rape me. I freaked out and tried to scream, but I couldn't make any sound. It was awful. I tried to tell My mother what happened, but I had lost my voice. Thank god I woke up! (72 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#129 (03/26/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that my father and I had to get secretly married. We were in some foreign country where that was the law. After we were married, we had to race back home. I couldn't fit everything into my suitcase, so I had to pack extra bags of all my stuff. When we got home, the whole cast of Friends was at my house. I told my father that the next time I got married, I wanted to have a white dress and that I wanted to marry someone that I loved in that way, not because it was the law. Then I woke up. Weird.

I dreamed that I was 18 and I went to a college that was similar to my high school. We had an all school meeting on day to address the issue of diversity. I had been asleep that night when some boy came into my room and wrote his name, address, and phone number on my ceiling. Apparently he was initiating some important moment, but I didn't understand. We then talked about terrorist bombings in Rome and Angels and Demons. I also dreamed that there was a TV show about killing wild cats. And I was on it, except I had no weapons! Lastly, I dreamed that Ed was rifling through all my stuff, but I don't know why. (119 words)

I had a dream that the girls' lacrosse team had a really early game one day or something, so they had to wake up at 6am on Sunday. Leanne was complaining that this was unfair because no one else had to wake up, so she demanded that the entire school wake up at 6am as well. I turned to her and snapped, "It's going to be really unfair when you get into Princeton because of your lacrosse skills, when far more deserving people get turned down, especially when they are much smarter than you!" That shut her up! Then I had a dream that I was in a store and had a fixed amount of money. I bought a pink iPod and a bottle of Chanel perfume. Then I decided to buy different perfume. And then I woke up, but had none of my purchases! (145 words)

I dreamed that I had sex with Doug. It was such a weird, vivid dream. We were in this huge, hot room, and then we just started stripping and had sex. He said it was the 4th happiest moment in his life. Then the rest of the school began to walk in and we started getting dressed really quickly. I didn't even know I could dream about having sex since I haven't had it yet! At least in my dream it was good and not scary! (86 words)

I dreamed that I had to take the AP US History exam, even though I hadn't taken the class. I also forgot all my pens and pencils and freaked out when I got to the exam. I asked if I could go home and change, but I wasn't allowed to. I left anyway and went down to the lake to take a break before I had to take the exam. On my way back up the hill, I couldn't move. Everyone around me was walking up the hill, and I became really mad because I thought I was going to miss the exam. I guess I was rooming with Victoria, because she was there too. I never made it to the AP, so I had to take it online during the summer. Then I had this power that I could make people fall in love with whomever they wanted. And then I woke up. (154 words)

Last night I had a dream that I was underground in some sewer. I was hiding from these assassins. I went home and had to go to class, but I couldn't find anything to wear, honestly. So I had to cut up some of my mother's clothes to wear. When I went to school, I had to make a salad as a test. There was a dressing that would sting you if you poured it wrong. I couldn't remember which dressing it was, but I wasn't supposed to ask, since it was the secret of the test. Pauline was in line inside and I tried asking secretly which one it was, but then I got yelled at! (117 words)

I dreamed that Mr. Winter was brainwashing us by interpreting The Great Gatsby incorrectly. Haley and I were the only ones in the class who knew and we both freaked out and ran away. We were on a train somewhere, a really huge train, like the size of a mall. I somehow knew the train was going to be hijacked, so we got off at Ed's house. There, I made plans for us to get picked up. When I went to get out of bed (that's where I was emailing from, I guess), I discovered that I was naked. I found some way to trick Ed into not looking at me while I ran away. I found a pay phone, but I needed 12 quarters to make a call. I wanted to call my mother to tell her I would be home late, but then I heard her calling my name, and I think she was in real life, which is why I woke up. (165 words)

I dreamed that Orlando Bloom went to my high school, and of course, all the girls wanted him, including me. But for some reason, he only wanted me! So we were in the dining hall (my friends and I), and I guess we were studying for exams. But Orlando walked up to our table and pulled me away. I guess he needed me to fix his shirt collar or trim his hair, because all of a sudden we were alone in the corner. I kissed Orlando. After that, he kept chasing me everywhere. Then I had another dream that I was hanging out with Jackson, just walking around and messing around and kissing, but then I looked at my watch and realized it was almost midnight. I had forgotten my curfew. I tried to take a train home and my father told me I should have been home earlier because I had to babysit that night. The kids wanted to rescue this horse, but it was out of Beauty and the Beast, the scene where all the wolves attack the beast, and Belle has to save him. So they finally went inside and had breakfast. Later I played soccer with Sue. (201 words)

Right before I went home, Jay invited me to a party he was having. (80 words)

Then Tyle was IM-ing me in class, but I couldn't see him anywhere. The whale, Free Willy, was there, and I had to play Text Twist to pass my final exam. I got the word "through." Then I saw Spike doing his laundry. (82 words)

I dreamed that I was with My mother, and she was looking for these papers from Mr. Manner. We went to his house, where my brother was making hamburgers. He was doing some dance about this one burnt hamburger. Kylie was there and she wanted me to go see a movie with her, but I told her I was jetlagged and about to fall asleep any minute. She said it was OK because she was working at The Old New Yorker, which was some sort of antique store of New Yorker magazines. Then Alexis and Sra. Perez wanted me to go shopping with them at this huge Victoria's Secret. But I remembered that I had just gone, so I told them no. Finally, Tyler was wearing a green polo shirt, and we were running around trying to hide from these guys who were chasing us. We kept diving into different communal beds at the refuge. We couldn't get away so we went to this Christmas store where they were taking pictures. We thought we would blend in because Tyler was wearing green, and it was Christmas. When we got there, I realized that Santa was missing from all the pictures, so I ran to the bathroom where he was apparently being held hostage. I saved him just in time. Then Tyler told me I was perfect and I kissed him! Then we ran away and I woke up. (238 words)

I was afraid my mother and father would be mad that I had brought a boy home, but they weren't since I was just trying to help him. They brought me on a trip and we had to wait in the airport for a long time before we traveled somewhere on the beach. I walked by Jay and he was so white. I was embarrassed in my bikini. Them I went back home and got on AIM, which is all I remember. (101 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#159 (07/15/2004 (age 15))

Last night I dreamed I was cross-country skiing to Gavin and Pete's room in Taylor. They were sharing a room, I guess, and I had to get bandages for someone. I thought it was ok to leave the dorm after check-in since I was trying to help someone else. Mrs. Crank was prowling Taylor and caught me hiding under Pete's bed. Although I thought it was OK, I still felt like I was doing something wrong. So then I was sent home for breaking check-in, and my father got really mad at me and lecture me in front of the whole boys' varsity hockey team. I was really embarrassed. Then I was at the refuge in the mountains with him and the boys' hockey team. A bus stopped and Lou got out. His footsteps made so much noise because he had gotten fat over the summer. Then my father was reading an updated version of The Great Gatsby, which was actually about Lou and me, and everything worked out in the end, and no one died. My favorite passage about their first kiss and the tuning fork (in the real book), had been rewritten about LOU giving me this look and me crying because he was convinced that he didn't like me. But then we got together in the end. That night I had to clean up the refuge for dinner. I began sweeping and mopping and Sophia got mad at me because she thought she had cleaned earlier, and that I was only cleaning because I thought she had done a bad job. So she got really pissed off. That night there was a big winter carnival with all sorts of sports games going on. Caroline wanted me to come watch her swim meet, but I wanted to watch the boys' hockey game. I went and remembered seeing Lou skate out onto the ice. I guess I started a new dream, because I was all of a sudden drafted for some war against England. My canon was stuck and I was so terrified. Then I got shot in the leg. I somehow ran to a boat collecting people, and Lou was there too for Christ's sake. We ended up in the Bermuda Triangle, where we got lost. The compass pointed north no matter we turned, so we had no idea how to get anywhere. We ended up pretending we were Peter Pan and Captain Hook fighting, and then I woke up. (412 words)

Last night I dreamed that Jackson was a horse manager/dealer or something, and Jessica and I were riding his horses in some show. Before the show we had to paint the horses. Jessica only painted one side, and Jackson was really mad. So I defended Jessica by saying, "Just because you can't get with her doesn't mean you have to be mean to her!" That shut him up! Then we rode our horses upstairs to the chairs outside the history wing. My mother was there, as well as all these mountain goats. Ben kept teasing the goats. Then I woke up. (101 words)

I also dreamed that everyone from my Spain group was at the refuge, and this giant snake was slithering around the room and I was just freaking out. But then Tom told me it was OK, and that it was actually Ben who was the snake. Then Ben turned him into a human, and I was so relieved. He told me the history of this witch put a spell on him when he was two years old so that he could only be human half of his life, and then he had to be a snake for the other half. Megan and I thought that was very sad, and then I woke up. (127 words)

I dreamed that for final exams at my high school, we all had to ride this train. It was horrible. The driver was crazy and kept saying, "This train will not crash," but we were all still horrified. Then I had a dream that all of the kids on my Spain group went to the same high school I woke up on the first day and tried a million outfits, but ended up ruining them because I'd drop mascara on them. Then finally I put on jeans and a pink shirt and a jean jacket, before realizing that I shouldn't wear a jean jacket with jeans. On the bus to school, I saw the Chloes. Mr. Chloe was really happy about their new baby. It began to rain. At school I realized I had no makeup on. Then I woke up. (141 words)

I dreamed that Pauline and I were sailing in the pool at my high school. I was really cold. Then all of a sudden, Althea and I were running to Bundy. When we got there, people started shooting paintballs at us, but they didn't hurt; they actually tickled! Althea and I still ran inside Bundy. When I got to my room, I realized that I didn't have my key. I started laughing because Ben was chasing me and tickled me when he caught me. Jessica was having her birthday party, but I had to stay at someone else's house. I called my father since I knew he was in the house where we are now. I asked him to call Hannah to ask if I could stay there. Then I saw Claudia, and just ended up staying with her. Sue was taking AP Modern European history again with a Buddhist teacher who served tea and taught them Chinese. Finally, I was sitting with some Spanish girls, and they were giving me candy.

I first dreamed that Sue and I lived on Bundy 3 and we wanted to go work out. I couldn't find shorts, but finally I did. I grabbed chapstick and my iPod and went to work out. While I was in the shower, Delia asked me to watch Zoey playing tennis downstairs. I thought that was really weird, and didn't care about going to watch tennis. I went home and got online. I was stuck online all night, and I just couldn't sign off --it was very frustrating. Then, all of a sudden, I was in Spain again with my family and I had to tell this Spanish guy a story about a man who ordered salmon, but really wanted soup, and had to change his order. I remember having a lot of trouble conjugating decir. So then our whole group was in Slate, which was in a huge hospital in the center of Madrid. Valerie was with Tom. We all had to shower in these old bathtubs before catching our flight home. When we got into the shower, I realized that I didn't have shampoo or conditioner or anything. I went through a mirror to get out and found myself in the middle of the hospital. I kept running around trying to find Slate so that I could catch my flight. My father was there too because he was trying to give me my mail before I left. And my brother was there too. We all started to climb this really unsteady driftwood ladder. We all fell, but my father caught me, and I was supposed to catch my brother, but I missed, and he fell so far. He just kept falling and falling and falling and cracked his skill when he hit the ground. I was crying so hard. We tried to bring him to the ER. He ended up going blind, never to play hockey again. I woke up because I was crying! Ahh! (327 words)

I dreamed that I was walking with Megan in my home state, and I had to go to school soon or something, because I was really nervous. I knew Kylie went to school here, so I called her and told her to meet me at the boathouse, where she could help me. But then I was at the Olympics watching my brother swim. There was an ancient pool table, and you had to use swords instead of pool sticks. I had this major crush on Sam, but Jon liked me, and my father only wanted me to see Jon, not Sam. It was just a big mess! (107 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#179 (08/16/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that I had moved back into Bundy with Camilia and we had an awesome room. Dorothy was our proctor and it just generally felt like it was going to be a good year. Then I had to go teach Sue and her dad how to play a combination of poker and gin right outside Langton. During the game, I realized that I had a field trip now. I ran back to the dorm and Sue was my roommate and all the furniture had been rearranged. I was really confused, but needed to pack for my field trip. I packed jellybeans and my ipod that was pink and also doubled as a hairdryer. Then I was home and had to get to school fast because I only had 2 minutes until 8am, when the bus for my field trip was leaving. My mother was pulling out of the driveway, and I kept waving at her to make her stop, and she finally did, but told me that if I wanted a ride I needed to get her the 2 Siamese kittens from the garden. I'm pretty sure I missed the field trip. Then I was a rabbit, and I was in the woods. The other rabbits were planning my funeral for the next day. They kept calling it my wedding though. I had decided myself though that I should have a funeral tomorrow though, because there was this bad rabbit that was going to hurt me. I was choosing the flowers before getting fed up with everything and just buried myself alive. How scary! (265 words)

I dreamed that the girls from my Spain program were al having a party in my old 6th grade classroom, which was actually my 1st grade classroom. Anyway, we were making a huge mess, and Jessica started ripping things off the wall. She kept saying something like, "Well it's not like the teacher's out there or anything." And of course, when I opened the door, Mrs. Montana was standing there and was very angry with us. She told us to clean everything up. I ate all her food and she just gave me a disappointed look, but I didn't care for some reason. Then I was at the beach with Alexis and Pauline, and Pauline had to come stay with me for 2 weeks. We were going to hang out and have fun! We were talking about our AP scores, and she got a 1, which I had found odd. Finally, I was online in the dining room where our piano is, and there was a huge storm outside. I was planning to meet all my friends at this baseball game, but the power kept going out, so I kept getting disconnected. I ran outside because I had to go save Mason. And then Anthony sent me a back-to-school package. (210 words)

I dreamed that Pauline and I were in American Studies, and our final exam was to do a scavenger hunt in the chapel. The whole school was there, and there were clues in Middle English. Pauline and I took a while to get to the end, but we finally did. We had to hack open a pew. When we did, there were fingernails inside. I screamed and cried and the whole school thought it was a terrific joke. It was horrible. Then Sue, Camilia, and I were all sharing a room in a small Spanish town, and were trying to get lunch, but the line was too long. Then I woke up. (112 words)

I dreamed that Hannah, Sue, and I were all going to a wedding on a farm. We didn't know what to wear, and Aidan kept stealing all our clothes anyway. I tried on all of my mother's clothes, and realized she had a lot of pretty silk Banana Republic dresses. But I couldn't wear those because I didn't have a bra. I had to go out into the garden and harvest a bra, since they grew from the ground, apparently. Then I woke up. (84 words)

Then everyone from my 8th grade class died. I was supposed to write a eulogy for all of them, but I had to write about Peter Pan and history of the progression from the book to the Disney movie. Anyway, days later, I was talking online to Aidan, and then he blocked me too! So now I was really mad, and Alexis came over and told me that my screen name had disappeared, so that's why no one was talking to me. Then she left for college, and my father got mad at me for being online late at night. (136 words)

I keep having this recurring dream that I am on Law and Order: SVU and I have to catch a serial rapist/killer. He always uses this particular knife that has a blue handle. I keep walking through all these houses, turning over tables, trying to find his next victim. Then I see this blue handled knife on the table in the last house, and I realize that I am the next victim. I open my mouth to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel like I'm choking and can't breathe at all. I always wake up gasping for air. It's always the same though. (105 words)

Last night I had a dream that I was taking an exam in the athletic center. Ian pulled me back and started flirting with me. I stroked his chest and then went to take my exam (what is my problem!?). Then I was in some huge house and it was all metal and connected to the athletic center. I had to go to a certain college, and my father was driving along a very precarious and windy road. I was watching him driving for some reason, when I think I was supposed to be in the car. We were on the golf course, on the 6th fairway. Then my brother woke me up this morning. (115 words)

But then we got into a fight because apparently we weren't having sex often enough. But I didn't even think we had yet in the first place. Then Ava and Jon were there, recruiting me to do some sort of skin research. We went to a fancy skin care lab to see how pimples formed and how to attack them. Then I got really tired, realized it was 2:45am, and decided to go to bed. And then I woke up mid-dream (within my real dream) to see that my whole body was covered in jewels. Then I woke up in real life. (140 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#194 (06/24/2005 (age 16))

I had a lot of dreams last night, about science class, oddly enough. The first was that Mr. Frank was my teacher and he had had another son and wanted me to go change its diaper. So Alexis and I brought him to the bathroom to change him. Right before we were leaving, though, I thought Alexis was holding onto him, so I let go and he fell, hit his head, and passed out. It was horrible. Then my final project for science was to do research on Jennifer Lopez, and present her success in terms of biology to a committee who wanted to figure out how to better market her. Anyway, I had forgotten my workbook, so I wasn't able to do that. Then Ross, from Friends, was my teacher, and he was leaving. I had had a crush on him or something, because I was really sad. He rocked me in his arms for a long time, and then left. I wrote his email address down from the board Later, I found out he had slept with some girl, so I told her that the other night, he had slept with another one of his students, so she got upset. Then I had a dream that I had to protect Annakin Skywalker and Padme before their wedding. It was really horrible because people kept shooting them, and I was usually in the way. Then I turned into Flounder from The Little Mermaid and I was paid $5000 to persuade an alligator to ambush the wedding. (257 words)

Last night I had a dream that I was boarding at a different school. There were kids from my Spain program and my high school there, and I think it was summer. Anthony visited me, and he was wearing a maroon college sweatshirt. Sue also had a boyfriend over. I asked Anthony to come sleep with me, but he refused because he had a paper to write. So this drove me a little crazy and I went to bed angry. And no he did not crawl into bed with me later; he had left the next morning without saying good-bye! I was really mad. (104 words)

I had the scariest dream that I was under the imperius curse (from Harry Potter). I was asleep (in m dream) and there must have been a bug crawling on my leg in real life, because in my dream, I thought that if the bug reached my belly button, I would start hallucinating and die. It was a scary combination of Batman Begins and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. (71 words)

Then Mrs. Glove walked near us and we went to the athletic center to get away from her. Then I was in a huge house with everyone from school. We were watching a movie and I told one of the freshman boys to sit next to me. I slipped off my seat, and everyone started making fun of me for having big boobs. Then all the girls went to shower, but for some reason, Ben was outside the bathroom, so they couldn't. Cecily couldn't work on yearbook, so she asked me too. Then the Nazis were chasing us and it was horrible. Everyone went on a cycling trip without me, and I was left behind with all the Nazis. Thank god I woke up. (161 words)

Bea 1: a high school student:#199 (07/04/2005 (age 16))

I had a dream that Tyler was talking to someone about a friend deserting him, and I made some snide comment to him about that. Then we were driving on windy roads around mountaintops, jumping over abysses like it was a video game. I had to wear lots of eye makeup and a tracksuit to do math problems while we jumped over the gorges. It was much more detailed, and everything felt so jam-packed into this one dream. (78 words)

First I dreamed that I was in a play directed by Esme, Hannah, and Margo, and I had a lead. I was rehearsing in front of the whole school for some reason. Then there was a magical world and a normal world, and I was part of both. But anytime something bad or scary happened in the magical world, my mother saved me somehow and brought me back to the normal world. There were all these weird curses on people, like they turned into dinosaurs. My brother always disappeared, and I was trying to get a job at the math help center. One time I was really scared, but no matter how hard I tried, my mother didn't come to save me. And then I realized that I had to save my mother. People kept asking me questions, so in real life I yelled, "I don't know!" and I said it in real life too. I just felt so trapped. (160 words)

Then I was at Meryl Streep's house by the pool, and there was a squid in the water. You had to swim across without the squid realizing you were in the water. Skye was disguised as a dinosaur, so I floated on him to scare the squid. Then I started a new dream where I was in school again and Aidan was sleeping next to me. I had to go to history class the next day. I was really excited for some reason when I went into class. We were reading a really important book from the first Church of England.

Aidan was there and didn't care, but Mason didn't want me sleeping with the rest of the boys. Then Judith and I were at my house and Mrs. Frank made me babysit her sons. We had to make sure the plants or dogs or anything didn't eat them. Billy called, and I hung up on hi, disconnected the phone, and swore off ever talking to anyone ever again. (107 words)

First I had some sort of sex dream or something. I can't remember most of it. Then I had a really scary dream; whenever I fell asleep I heard loud scary noises, so I'd jolt awake because I was so scared. When I finally did fall asleep (in my dream), I dreamed that I was on the train to the city with Hannah to see a play. We had to miss the first day of school, and I had snuck out. There was a long dinner that was really formal. The Weasly family was there, but everyone tried to humiliate them. Then we were on the train back to school, and Arthur, Ian, Julian, Andrea, and Conrad plus 100 other people from my high school were there. (127 words)

I dreamed that I was in English class again with Mason and Julian. They were chasing me around London, and I didn't know where to go. Next, I dreamed I was shopping in the designer stores near our apartment in Rome. I didn't realize they were designer stores until I checked the prices. Alexis and I were going to go out to lunch, but we didn't know if it was a fancy restaurant, so we didn't know what to wear. (80 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#211 (08/01/2005 (age 16))

First, I dreamed that I was really numb all of a sudden. I was reading and then sort of seized up. Then I remember that I had had two shots of vodka, two Ibuprofens, and my mother's meds, and I had my period. So in really slow motion, I tried to get to bed to go to sleep. Next I dreamed that I was at the last boys' hockey game, and I had to say good-bye to all my friends. So first I said good-bye to Judith. And Mabel was there, but then she wasn't. Next I said good-bye to Mason, and he was sitting between Vanessa and Beth, both his girlfriends, so I apologized for embarrassing him in front of them. Then I said good-bye to Leo, Ida, Hazel, and Etta, and Wong, who tried to push me off the bleachers. Finally I said good-bye to Arthur, Bud, and Jayden. I looked on the ice and saw Lou, playing defense, and he accidentally let the puck by and spluttered, "It...it wasn't my fault." I felt bad for him and thought, There's so much I want to say right now that can't be said in a letter. Then, very sad, I looked at the rink one last time and left. At home, my father and I had to go get my brother from his hockey game. My father wanted me to drive to get used driving conditions. But before we left my computer malfunctioned and I had about 12 copies of every program on my desktop, which was really annoying. Then I woke up. (264 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#212 (08/02/2005 (age 16))

It was my graduation (in my dream) and I had this white lacy dress that looked much better on the hanger than it did on me. It was see-through and you could tell that I was wearing my bright yellow Victoria's Secret underwear. So I ran up to my room in Bundy to change, when I ran into Mrs. Persky, who confessed to me she had 3 boyfriends she had been seeing. I excitedly followed her upstairs, where she said she was hiding one of them. But on the way up, someone had dropped her camera and everyone on the staircase got "camera poisoning." They were all rushed to the infirmary, where all the old senior boys were the doctors. Then I woke up. (124 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#213 (08/03/2005 (age 16))

I dreamed that I was in some hospital waiting for my brother because he'd broken his arm. Then this guy (who was a lot older than I) sat down next to my father and me and began to flirt with me. My father got annoyed and told him to piss off, which he did. But then his friends came and tried to assault my mother. So I told the nurse, and she made them leave. Next, I found a scooter, and started scootering around the hospital. Then this little boy borrowed it from me and broke his leg. Later, I decided to give the scooter to him, before I realized that he was paralyzed for life. This made me cry. My next dream was that we came home from Italy and had 5000 phone messages, but they were all just recordings of Harry Potter. I tried to check my email, but my computer had broken. (155 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#214 (08/04/2005 (age 16))

First I dreamed that Kylie and I went to another one of Jon's parties, this time with more people from my high school. There were so many people there that they made us get into two lines, 1 of boys, and 1 of girls. Whomever we matched up with next to us was our hookup partner for that night. I got someone gross, so Kylie and I left to go home and watch a movie. I went to work out the next day, and there was a hockey camp there. There were lots of boys in the gym, and I was a little intimidated. Finally, I dreamed that I was a beautiful princess and I was at the beach. I saw a Norwegian prince and we fell in love at first sight. But it was like Romeo and Juliet, and our parents didn't want us to be together, so we had to run away and hide at the New York Times, where I had to write an article about us eloping. (171 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#215 (08/05/2005 (age 16))

First I dreamed that I was in Tudor England (the class), but I didn't have the right textbooks, so Mr. Bailey gave me his old ones. Then at the end of class, it was the last day of school, because I went back to my dorm room (which I shared with my brother for some reason), and then realized I needed to gather my stuff from everywhere else. So I went back to Tudor England to get my books, returned to my dorm room, and then needed to go back to get my yearbook. When I got back to the classroom, Ian was there, and he kept trying to kiss me. I think he might have if my father hadn't been there. Apparently my father and mother were taking us out to coffee to celebrate the end of the year. So he went to wait in the car. I said good-bye to Lucas and left. I ran into Willis, whom I had a long good-bye with. He told me his sister was hurt, and for the life of me, I couldn't remember her name. I kept thinking it was Amy, and not until I woke up did I remember it was Arlie. I got back to my room and my brother was packing. I had a million emails to read, but I deleted half of them. Just then, I heard a horn honking and knew it was my mother and father outside. They told us they were taking us somewhere in the city. I was reluctant to go because the next morning was the first day of the next school year. Before we left though, I had to return to elementary school to get my writing portfolio from 4th grade. After I found Mrs. Jones and got my writing portfolio, the guy who looked like Jude Law in the airport was there and said he loved my writing. The next day was proctor retreat and I had to swim in the lake with Tuck while Mrs. Carter told me being a proctor was a useless job anyway. (347 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#216 (08/06/2005 (age 16))

First, I dreamed the 2005 prom was at our house. I got asked several times and ended up going with Lance. At the end, Lou got up to play a song (I was already over him) and he sang this beautiful love song to Marion. So that made me sort of sad, but I told myself I'd gotten over him anyway. And then Lance told me that it had actually been my name there in the song, but that Lou had changed it last minute because he didn't want me to know how he felt. So I decided to tell him instead. I knew he was in my brother's old room and the poor guy couldn't go to sleep because he was in there with some girl. I knocked on the door and said, "Excuse me, you can't be in there and you need to come out now. We won't watch you come out, but you need to." I was hoping that by hearing my voice, Lou would tell me he loved me. But instead he said, "We'll get out as soon as you make us a hotel reservation and bring us some fiber pills." At this, I thought my mother was in there because she takes fiber pills, so I wrenched the door open, and sure enough, Lou was lying there with my mother. Horrified, I slammed the door and started yelling, crying, and screaming. Lou didn't seem to care. I ran downstairs to get a phone book and threw it onto the bed yelling, "Make your own stinking, dirty hotel reservation" and all he did was laugh. I was so upset that I begged Sue to let me stay at her house. She was already having a sleepover with Hannah, so I slept in the living room. Mrs. Dunn made sure I had everything I wanted, and Mr. Dunn asked me about my college search. Sue had already gotten in somewhere, I think. The next morning we all went to Yuma, and I told them how everything was on sale. I bought a white bikini, and everyone else got shampoo and shoes. Olivia turned up later, back from Spain, but we didn't have any time to talk. Finally, I went home and on my computer was an IM chat from Tyler that said, "I can't help myself, or you." So I asked him what he meant, and he said he loved me. Then I woke up. (408 words)

First, I dreamed I was in Honors English and Mr. Winter was teaching us about hyperbole and metaphor. Allison needed a pencil, so I lent her one. Then we were all sitting in class and Mr. Winter called me on a phone at my desk and told me I had to tell Dorothy she was going to die in 3 hours. So I freaked out and started sweating and shaking and yelled to Dorothy to get to a hospital. Hannah was there, gossiping. Next we were all in the dining hall, and I was sitting with Alexis, Pauline, Faith, and Kylie. I was asking Faith and Kylie about the parties they had been to while I had been in Italy. (120 words)

I had a lot of dreams last night, the first being that I was in the mall in Rome with Isaiah, and we were going out, but I didn't really want to be going out with him. I couldn't figure out how to break up with him. My father wanted to take a book out of the library for me on James Dean, but it turns out he had to buy it since it was a Roman library or something. Next, we were all at school, but it was a girl's school and Mrs. Persky and Mr. Chloe were married. Hermione had hooked up with Sirius and then Sirius had died, like in Harry Potter. Everyone was really mad at Hermione. And then there were some other dreams in there about Lou. (132 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#219 (08/11/2005 (age 16))

Last night I had a dream that we were still in Italy on some secret boat chase. We docked in Rome and I got together with 30 other people my age, which I sort of knew, but not that well. Then we got home and had to go to school. I realized I was naked when I got to school, so I tired to stay behind and get dressed, but wasn't embarrassed at all. While I was trying to get into my pink corduroys and a white polo shirt, I thought of all the ways I could try to get Lou's attention. There was a puppy that was trying to attack me while I was getting dressed. Finally, we left the chapel and went outside where everyone was singing hymns. My mother had to call my father to discuss dinner plans, since I had a hockey game. I went to lunch and sat with Olivia. I noticed Andrea at the table next to Lou at a nearby table, so I rushed at Andrea screaming, and Lou noticed and Andrea got mad. Then I saw Valerie and Ashley. (187 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#220 (08/23/2005 (age 16))

Last night I had the worst dream of my life. First I was near the senior steps by the back of the dining hall, and my brother fell and landed with what I kept repeating in my head as "a sickening crunch." It was horrible. He had to be dead. Then I came home and my father had to fight these monsters working with Voldemort in the lake. He had a gun that looked like the remote control, and he got frustrated when I couldn't understand how it worked. I cut up his purple and white boxers to use as Clothies, because I didn't know when I'd see him again. My mother was tanning on the deck and I went inside the kitchen to be sad about my father leaving. I noticed the creamer standing outside the pantry. Slowly, it turned to face me. I got so scared. Fritz was evil and rabid and working with this creamer, trying to prove that my mother and I were anorexic. I ran upstairs because I was so scared. I went into my brother's room and jumped into his bed, nearly hysterical with fear, begging him to let me sleep there. My brother had this nail in his back, which I guess was serving as his stitches. The evil Fritz came in with the creamer and ripped the nail out of his back, and I screamed. Apparently, the nail was a family heirloom of Slytherin. There was also a cactus on my brother's bedside table, and it was a Horcrux that Voldemort used. He recovered because all of a sudden, he and Russell and Ted and I were all on the run from Voldemort. We were running around London and my high school, which was in London, trying to escape. We ran into my room and my roommate was Ron. Hector was chasing us too. He wanted to kill my baby, because apparently I was pregnant. We are running everywhere and Ginny started to slow down. I started freaking out, but saw this French marching band on the Spanish Steps (I guess we got to Rome somehow). The band members were all dressed in brightly colored robes and were supposed to help us, but they didn't. They just kept playing their instruments and waving their flags. We tried to save my mother and get back to school. Then I was supposed to go on a date with Pete. This was right after hockey practice, so I went to the bathroom to try and primp myself. For some reason, I wet my pants, but it didn't matter. I came out and Ian began pouring his heart out, telling me I was the only one for him, and that he loved me. But I was still so scared that I ran to my high school and burst into tears and I woke up crying. (479 words)

I dreamed that someone had sabotaged Andrea, so I invited her to my house so she could escape. Marion came with us and so did Gabby. Then we were at orientation in the music building, and I can't remember anything else. Then I was living somewhere between New York and my high school. Harvey was playing in a concert and wanted me to tell him I loved him, but I just ignored him. Jennifer Anniston wanted to go on a date with my parents. Then last year's seniors were doing "senior mauling," where they beat up all the underclassmen. Ian kept tickling me and we were laughing. Tyler saw us and got upset because Ian was talking to me. I found a secret passage underneath Slate, and I led Ian through it. Then I was in Chinese class with Jasper and I got a 90% on my homework. (148 words)

My first dream was that I was researching something in the library and it closed early, so I had to leave and go to lunch. The dining hall was huge --like the size of Grand Central. Gary was doing some sort of dance, and Sue was trying to talk to me while I got raspberry and mandarin orange flavored avocados. There was a live band there for some reason. Before I knew it, however, I was in New York babysitting this boy, Preston. He had myspace and 2 of his friends were coming over to play. But I couldn't find Preston. His friends arrived, a brown haired girl and a boy who looked much older than Preston. The boy was German and had an older brother my age. The brother was really cute and asked me to watch his brother for an hour or so. I gave up on Preston and watched the German boy instead. Finally the older brother came back after having coffee, and we all took the train back to my school's state. Then I went back to the city and was living in an apartment. Across the street Jennifer Garner taught 3rd grade. Ben Stiller was living with me and wanted to go to Jennifer's classroom. They met on the side of the street and she loved his poodle, Fluffy. They agreed to meet later for an ice cream. This train ran into my apartment and ruined everything. My mother and I were scrambling out. In the scuffle, we lost Fluffy, but we found Skye and Fritz, who were alive. We stepped onto the street and the cute German boy saw me. His mother thought I was Swedish. My brother was hanging around by the train wreck, and my father, my mother, and I all drove over to take him away. He wanted to show off in front of Francine and her friends, so he hopped in backwards through the window. Then I woke up. (329 words)

Last night, I first dreamed that we were getting new flavors of ice cream in the snack bar. I was in the library with Sue when we found this out. Mr. Chloe wanted us to babysit. So we did, but then we had to leave to go bake cookies or something. Then it was the last day of school, and everyone rushed out of main building to the music building, where we had to listen to a concert. Everyone kept sliding down the side of the hill. All of a sudden, I was in the alumni house with a Spanish home stay family (and I communicated with them in Spanish in my dream). Margo was there and we were looking for ice cream, before I realized I had to be babysitting. I ran into the main building and went down to the English wing, where there was a talk about college. The bell rang and I had to run up to the history wing, where I knew no one. Then I woke up. (173 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was back at school, but it was a combination of my high school and my college . I was having my English seminar with Clark, but James and Ed were there. Then I was naked, but I had to go to philosophy where we were reading Wittgenstein. I was horrified that I was naked, but no one seemed to notice. Then it got dark and I couldn't find my way back to the dorm. Then I woke up. (84 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was in the gym and was really anxious to check mail because I was waiting to hear from a study abroad program and a teaching program, for some reason. I found out I had been accepted to the teaching program and was really excited to tell Aaron. When he looked at my letter though, we realized that it was only a solicitation for an application, not an acceptance. I was really embarrassed. Then I woke up. (82 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#003 (05/26/2007)

I had a dream that I was at the Caan dining hall, which was actually my high school's dining hall. I don't remember why I was there. Aaron was there to see Britta. I saw Britta and kept trying to get a better look at her. I remember being disappointed by the cereal selection. I called Tyler to help me with the cereal. And then I saw Aaron again right before I woke up. (74 words)

I had a dream that I was a senior at my high school again. Newsom, Ben, Lee, Sue, everyone was there. It was the last few days before we were about to graduate. Lou, Adam, and Julian showed up. I think Pauline was there too and we all had lunch. Before that I had a dream that I had missed all my math classes and also didn't have the textbook, so I couldn't even catch up. I went to the dance studio, where there was a soundproof room, so I could blast whatever music I wanted. I wanted it as loud as it went. I started listening to AC/DC and pretended to play the air guitar. And then I got an email from Aaron, in my dream, which I thought I had gotten in real life. (136 words)

Last night I dreamed I was holding Fluffy and she had all sorts of things inside her, like a stuffed mouse that I had to keep track of. It was my high school graduation again but everyone was running around somewhere, like a street in Spain. Then there were these huge...pods, or something in the sky where we had to sleep, like out of The Matrix or something. I went up to one with a guy Martin, who looked like someone from The O.C. We were up there trying to sleep and it started raining. Martin wanted to have sex, but I didn't, but I was afraid to say no. I left the pod, but he followed me, and I became really afraid. But then he left and I woke up. (131 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was at some combination of my high school and my college and there was an end of the year spring dance. I was hanging out with Kim, Jessica, and Julian beforehand. My date was someone from my high school, but I can't remember who it was. Some boys from my high school were there. I was really anxious because I thought I was being stood up. I had bought a really flashy, silver dress that was really low cut, and I guess I only just realized that it was too low cut. Then I woke up. (102 words)

I had the worst dream last night. First it started out OK: Aaron and I were fooling around somewhere, and I was really happy and excited. Then I went home and in the guest room was my brother and Lauren. They had been playing some game with a baby, but they accidentally dropped her when I came in. The baby started bleeding everywhere and it was really scary. I was trying to keep her alive with ice and by holding her upright, and my brother and Lauren were really scared. The baby was OK, so I went downstairs to the kitchen to hang out with Judith and my father before prom. I was really happy because Aaron was taking me. So then right before I was about to leave, I asked where my mother was so I could say goodbye to her. My brother looked at me very pityingly and said that our mother had died last night. I laughed because I thought he was joking but he was serious and I demanded why no one had told me. He said because there hadn't been a good time. I started crying so hard and was hugging Aaron really tightly. He kept saying, "I'm really sorry, but if it came down to your mother or your sister, aren't you glad your sister's alive?" I guess he was referring to the baby who was OK after all the bleeding. All I could think was, She's not my sister! It was horrible. (249 words)

My dream was really weird last night. First I was living in an apartment with 4 other girls and 5 other guys. I was trying to make everyone go to sleep, but Jessica had a tennis match and was making a lot of noise. Then there was another guy with long dirty blonde hair, sort of like a California surfer. I guess we had been dating for a while. He was hugging me and saying, "I'm surprised I haven't broken you yet." And I got really scared because I did not want to be with him. I suggested we make oatmeal (in order to distract him). He poured his down the sink, which hurt my feelings for some reason. Finally, my father, my mother, and I were all driving in New Haven, but my father couldn't drive properly, so my mother had to take over. Weird. (146 words)

My dream last night was that it was spring gala at my college, but it was actually at my high school 's hockey rink, which was located right in the middle of Manhattan. There was a lot of confusion surrounding the event: first, I had forgotten my dress but had no way of getting home to retrieve it; My mother was be really unhelpful; Jessica was trying to call me, but my phone wouldn't work, and the whole time I am just trying to get my dress. I somehow managed to shower and get ready, and even timed my arrival at the rink properly so that I was neither too early, nor too late. I soon realized, however, that I had put no eye makeup on, so I scrambled through my bag looking for mascara and eyeliner. I ran to the bathroom. In my dream, I thought I looked great in my shiny silver dress and strappy high heels, even though I would probably wear neither of those items in real life. So I finished applying eye makeup and tried to find Aaron. I had been looking forward to gala for a while because I wanted to be with him. On the bleachers of the rink was every guy from my high school. But I was frustrated because I only wanted to see Aaron, but instead I could only see every guy from high school. I kept hoping he would just find me and pull me away. And even as I started waking up, I tried to stay asleep to see if I would ever find Aaron, but I never did. It was almost as if I knew my conscious self couldn't see him, so I wanted my unconscious side to compensate for the absence. (295 words)

I had the worst dream last night: that Aaron and Britta got back together. Aaron really wanted me to meet Britta, and I wanted to meet her, but it was really upsetting for me to see them together. They were kissing and cuddling and laughing right in front of me, and I could tell they were really in love. Britta would talk, and Aaron would just gaze at her, and I felt so...wasted. I was so upset and mad, but I wanted Aaron to be happy too. And Britta was smart and pretty; I felt like I couldn't compare. I got so fed up and couldn't watch them together, so I left. Then I woke up. (116 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#011 (07/17/2007)

Last night I had a dream that I was first reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and it was taking place in space. I kept trying to stay asleep so I could read it, since it wasn't really coming out for a while. Then Andrea and I were at the ocean, and she accidentally let my hand go, and I was floating in the middle of the ocean. The crew team came and saved me. Then I was back at my college and moving in for the year, clearing out drawers and closet space. It was really bizarre because my brother knew all these people that I did. (109 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#012 (07/22/2007)

Last night I had a dream about Aaron and Britta again. It was similar to the last dream I had about them, in that Aaron wanted me to be friends with Britta, and he didn't try to hide her or anything to spare my feelings. He just outright showed affection for her and everything. And again, I just felt so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to make myself feel better or change the situation, because I wanted to be with Aaron, but I also wanted to stay friends with him, so I had to be friends with Britta. The dream was odd though because Britta wasn't a pretty blonde girl, but rather a tiny Vietnamese girl. And I liked her. And even though she was the Britta, Aaron's Britta, there was some part of her that secretly wasn't. It was weird, but I knew this to be true. Anyway, this is all so stupid because it shows that I am just anxious about seeing Aaron again and worried that he will have gotten back with Britta. (177 words)

I had the weirdest dream last night! I was just hanging out with Chandler, and then we had sex! And I didn't want to tell him it was my first time, but of course he found out when I started bleeding. It was awful and afterward I hadn't wanted him to be my first, so I was really upset. Then I was trying to throw a party, but too many people came, and it was just so weird and I was really happy to wake up! (86 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#014 (07/28/2007)

I had a really bad dream last night. I was back at my high school and trying to go to the gym. For some reason all the teachers and a lot of the students hated me and thought I was a bitch. I couldn't understand why, but it felt horrible for everyone to dislike me so much. I think I finally did make it to the gym, and everyone there was really rude to and mad at me because I was wearing my tennis skirt, and I guess that was offensive. It was a silly dream, but it felt awful to be disliked, and I wanted to go back and rewrite whatever it was I had done to become so unpopular. (121 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#015 (07/31/2007)

Last night I had the worst dream that my mother died. It was honestly the worst dream I had ever had. I had been talking to her two days before, and I somehow knew she had died, which made me hysterical when the police showed up at the front door to tell us officially. And I guess I had known that when I had been talking to her before hadn't been real, like some sort of recording. But I started screaming and crying so hard and convulsing when I found out she had died, because I had remembered telling my father how lucky I felt that no one I loved had ever died and it was really only a matter of time before someone did. I just kept wishing and hoping that I could talk to her one last time. I would have given anything to see her and hear her voice just one last time. I was so so so so happy when she crawled into bed with me and I started crying because I had been so scared! (180 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#016 (08/07/2007)

Last night I had a really weird dream. First, my college was inside some sort of mall and the gym was also a music room. When you biked or ran, the machine produced music based on how well you were exercising. So I guess I was in there with Aaron and Rick and others when the music my machine was making started sounding really bad. I was trying to find a way to fix it, but Rick, Aaron, Jasper, Mandy, and Buddy all started squirting water bottles at me, which was funny for the first few seconds, but then got annoying. I began to cry and finally escaped. I climbed up this stepladder to a room with a glass-domed ceiling so you could see all the stars. There was light, soft music, and couples dancing slowly. I saw Aaron alone, looking up at the stars. Something told me he didn't want to be disturbed. I felt sad and left. (159 words)

I had such a realistic dream last night. First it was my last day at my job, and for some reason I was having trouble figuring out my time card. I couldn't add the hours up properly or something. I guess I figured it out though. Then the blonde girl upstairs (the one who reminds me of Aaron's Britta) was crying because her boyfriend's mother had died. So then I walked home (my job was near my house I guess), and on the way I heard someone putting down women. I ran over and started shouting at them before I realized it was Jackson. I later learned that he was speaking at his mother's funeral, and that I had misunderstood what he had said. I found him later that night to apologize, and he took me in his arms and kissed me. And I kissed him back and we were hugging and grabbing at each other. I was trying to remember if we had been doing this same thing years ago and just continuing it now, or if this is the first time it had happened. I must have thought it was the first time, but in any event, things began to heat up really fast and I remembered we were supposed to be at a funeral, so we broke apart. And then we were sitting in a golf cart, and I felt so...in love. No one around me mattered. I kept fixing his tie or holding his hand. Gabby (random) saw us and either was jealous of me, or wanted to protect Aaron from getting hurt, because she really disapproved of Jackson and me. I wanted to come back later to continue hooking up with Jackson, but when I got home I realized that I had to go back to school right away. Everything was so real though. (309 words)

I woke up angry this morning because of my dream. It was a situation like in Blindness, where we all lost hearing instead of sight. It was total chaos. I somehow found my whole family in this huge city and was crying and kissing them and telling them how much I loved them. I got separated from them for a bit, but I guess I found friends and we all did homework together. Then we were lying down, and not surprisingly, Aaron was next to me. My father had told me earlier that he didn't like Aaron, and I told him that it didn't matter because Aaron and I were no longer dating. Lying there, however, Aaron and I were together again and we were touching and kissing until another girl came and lay down next to him. Then he forgot about me and went on touching her. I was really annoyed and left and woke up annoyed! (158 words)

Last night I first had a dream that I was kidnapped and being held hostage in the woods. Our cell phones wouldn't work, and the people who had kidnapped us had taken our kayaks and paddles. My next dream was that I was playing hockey with my women's club team, but something was wrong, like one of the girls wasn't allowed to play. Then I was in the dining hall and I think Michelle had died because I kept crying every time I tried to eat. Then I was on an Outing Club trip with Jessica, Kim, Sydney, and Abigail. Rem and Kat and left behind all our spandex, so we were really embarrassed that we had nothing appropriate to wear. Alec tried to help us find them, which didn't make it all any less embarrassing. But then I think in the end we all went snowshoeing. (147 words)

I dreamed last night that I was hooking up with Aaron after a Halloween party. I was really frustrated because I had promised myself I wasn't going to do that anymore. But just as I decided that, we got naked and I didn't care anymore. Now, I decided, I would finally have sex. I was so happy to be with him again and he was making me laugh and feel so comfortable. I was finally ready. But then I was back at school and trying to organize all my shoes. For some reason I had a lot of shoes. Then I woke up. (103 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#022 (10/30/2007)

I had a strange dream within a dream kind of thing last night. I guess I was doing psych research or something with this boy and his mother, but there dreams were so real that they would wake up and have things fro the dream. I went into the boy's dream and he was remembering when his father was riding a horse and had really scared him (the little boy). I can't remember the mom's dream, but it was something more related to my life. It was scary for those dreams to be so real, even though they weren't mine. And I had to get out of their dreams first before I could get out of my own dream. I had to consciously wake myself up. (126 words)

I dreamed last night that I was back working for my job in the art books section. The department was located in some old ruined dorm at my high school. Yet I was somehow very close to the Alps and everywhere else in Europe. I had to snowboard throughout Europe (which was tricky enough since I can't snowboard) and steal art for my job in exchange for cocaine. And I don't know why but I was trying to acquire 40 grams of it. Aaron was there and was talking to Britta, even though he had come to visit me. I sent them on a tour of Europe to keep them busy while I tried to find the 40 grams of cocaine. Then I woke up. (125 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#024 (12/24/2007)

I had a dream last night that there was a second rink at my college and that all these guys were playing a new kind of hockey. They weren't skating, but instead they ran around with large oversized crayons, whacking a ball around on the floor. Sam had brought me, but I didn't want to play. I just wanted to watch. Philip was there, but I can't remember why. At one point, Sam tried to get me a crayon so I could play, and I think Philip was jealous. The rink was the deepest shade of green I have ever seen (or imagined). And the "ice" was yellow. And the rink was a sort of dank and deserted place, but there were secret rooms and an elaborate system of staircases. But this shade of green just seemed too dark to be real, but I remember knowing that it was green. (150 words)

I had a strange dream last night. First, I went back for RA training. At night we were watching a movie in an opera house. No one was allowed to eat any candy besides Starbursts. Mario was getting really mad at anyone who was talking. Next, I was going to a sleepover with all my old roommates from last year and my brother. Sophia was as annoying as ever, but I was trying to get along with her and be diplomatic. Then I was living in an attic in South America, where they had slaves. I had to take a really long train ride to get down there, and I kept trying to send Anthony letters, asking him to rescue me, but I couldn't spell his address correctly. The woman at the post office kept getting mad at me. When I got there, there was a bullfight. And then someone bought me a pair of those footie pajamas. But I really didn't like the bullfight, but I just couldn't figure out how to leave. (174 words)

I first dreamed that I was going to New York with Sue and Ava. Maria was tagging along. We all went to CVS before we left to get snacks and nail polish. We were driving to the city in this awful stick shift car, and Maria was trying to get us to bake her a cake since it was her birthday. I think we ended up not making it to the city, and instead I had RA training again. But it was summer this time. I was eating breakfast at Heinz, and it was very crowded because all the athletic teams were there. I could hear Mario's voice. All the new RAs had to do a dance as initiation, and I was laughing. I remember seeing Philip and Ainsley and Roberto and Mario. Also Enrique Iglesias was there. There were paintings all over this whole room, really beautiful paintings. I was talking to someone about art and hockey and Les Miserables. I remember being really hot because I was dressed in warm clothes and it was August, and I woke up sweating. (182 words)

I had the most ridiculous and vivid dream yesterday. I was dreaming that Kit had a girlfriend (a gorgeous blond girl) and she was sitting on his lap. We were in some room with a ton of other people watching The Office. I kept trying to be funny and make comments during the show to get his attention, but he kept rolling his eyes at me and scoffing and being generally quite icy to me. So I left because I was sick of flirting with him and getting rejected. I was walking on the street. I was with 4 other guys from my program, not specific guys, but I just knew they were on my program. They were laughing and joking and then I told them about how that guy the other week had harassed me on the street and hit me. Then they all started harassing me and grabbing and hitting me too. I freaked out and told them to stop, but they continued slapping me, so I started crying and ran up the street and straight into Jayden's arms. He hugged me and asked what was wrong. I was crying and he kissed me so hard and told me it would be okay. I was confused as to why he was kissing me when he had been pretty rude earlier. He said he hadn't wanted to flirt with me in front of his girlfriend. (236 words)

I had a dream that made me feel like I was cheating on Clayton. I was sitting in a chairlift going downhill, backwards. It was dark and warm all around me, even though I think I knew it should have been cold and snowy. Kit was sitting next to me, his arm around me, and his five o'clock shadow rubbing against my cheek as he nuzzled me. I felt my entire body tensing, gathering energy, pulsing and warm. I squeezed his knee with my right hand; I have a distinct memory of digging my nails into his thigh to release the pressure. The tension was building and I just waited for everything to snap. The dark began to dissolve around a tiny yellow light that brightened in front of me. The light grew and shrank, grew and shrank, grew and shrank until it overwhelmed the darkness, and I was twisting and squirming and grabbing his leg and having an orgasm. And when I woke up I felt like I had cheated on Clayton. (173 words)

I had an orgasm in my dream last night, and I'm pretty sure I had one in real life too. I was lying on a beach and some guy, I don't know who, was touching me. We weren't having sex; he was just touching me. He was kneeling over me and holding onto this sword. Whenever he pushed his sword deeper into the sand, he touched me a little deeper. The phallic imagery is pretty obvious, but we weren't actually having sex. Anyway, it kept going like this until I had an orgasm and woke up from it. My god! (100 words)

I had a dream that memories and dreams weren't allowed. There was a secret service that went around and erased peoples' memories. There was a way to hide if you had any memories, though, and I tried to figure out what it was. I was terrified that they would erase all my dreams, my past, my memories, so I tried to pretend I was blank and had already been erased. Then they went into my room in Fenster and tried to rip up my pillows and comforter to find my dreams. Ugh, it was awful! (95 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#033 (12/31/2009)

I had a dream that I was engaged or betrothed to marry Wyatt, without really knowing it. I think I woke up on my wedding day and had all these things to do. I think I had some recollection in my dream of having been proposed to. And at the time I was thinking, Well, I could do a lot worse. But I'm only 21. Do I really want to get married this early? Does he even love me? And we haven't even had sex yet. What if it's not good? Anyway, I said yes anyway. So that day I had to buy presents for My mother and my father, because that was some sort of new tradition. Wyatt and I were riding in a limousine to go to the store, and I just kept thinking, This is so unfair. He still gets another year of college, and I will have graduated and will have to pay his tuition. I can't do that! And what if he hooks up with other girls while he is at school and I am working? We got to the store and I bought finger puppets for my mother and father. When I got home, all my underwear was strung up on a line hanging outside the door. I wasn't embarrassed, since Wyatt was going to be my husband, but I also didn't understand why it was strung up there. My mother had told me she had made all the arrangements for the wedding, which I suppose made my decision easier, since I didn't have to think about anything. All I know is that my father spent $160,000.00 on the wedding, which I felt bad about, since I don't even really remember having ever gotten engaged or telling them about it. I kept thinking that I was only 21 and had so much more to do in life. At the same time, Wyatt was a good guy and I could certainly learn to love him. On the way to the beach where we were supposed to get married, it started snowing. So that upset me, since the wedding was supposed to be outside. All the flowers were dead when we got there. And I didn't have a wedding dress. I guess that was my only responsibility, but since I had no idea about this wedding, I didn't realize I had to get a dress. So I ran away, and just kept running, away from everyone at the beach. I ran into my father, who was on his way over and I started crying and said I was so sorry he had spent all that money, but that I couldn't get married. I woke up, panicked, and so happy that I wasn't married. (457 words)

Last night I had a dream that I was swimming in the river in Van Gogh's Starry Night Over the Rhone. It was cold and windy, but the water was warm. There were islands that were actually paintings, and sometimes I wanted a break, so I would grab onto the paintings, but then the oil would run and the canvas was ruined. (62 words)

I had a dream that I was dressed up in different Halloween costumes, except I was part of some Avatar world where people were trying to kill me. Bryson and I were running around trying to hide by putting different costumes on. Then I went back to school, where I weighed myself and realized I had gained 65 pounds over winter break. I was horrified and upset. Maybe it's just the costume that weighs so much, I thought, but I knew that it wasn't. (84 words)

Last night I had a dream that I had to go to Japan with my mother for some reason. We drove to the airport, which was at my high school, and I was able to pack everything into this small DVD case. I asked if we were going to drive to California and fly from there, or if we were just going to drive to JFK and fly from there. My mother said it would be better to just drive to JFK. We got onto the plane, and even though the flight was supposed to be 12 hours, we were only going for 1 day. When we got to Japan, I remember that instead of all the skyscrapers, there were these incredible trees from Avatar. They had these phosphorescent leaves that lit up depending on the season. I guess all the seasons went by in the 1 day we were in Tokyo, because the leaves changed from pink, to orange, to green, to blue, which was supposed to indicate a whole year going by. They were beautiful against the night sky. On the way home, my brother and my father joined us, and we all went to a dentist's office together. I don't know why, but apparently the dentists were better in Japan. The dentist spoke English, but all the magazines in the waiting room were in Japanese. The "dentist" was eating yogurt and a Snickers bar, which I remember thinking was weird, since he was a dentist and shouldn't eat candy. This "dentist" turned out to be an old friend of my mother and father's, and we stayed at his house for another night for a party. The dentist was an older man, and I found him very attractive, even though I don't find older men attractive in real life. He was putting all this food on the tables to occupy everyone, and then he cornered me and started flirting with me. I think I had been drinking wine, because I felt a little giddy and flirtatious too. He was wearing a gray suit and looked very sharp. Then I woke up. (353 words)

My first dream was that I was on a show like America's Next Top Model with all my girlfriends. We had to do different tasks or photo shoots before one of us was eliminated. I remember being worried because everyone else had really elaborate outfits, and I was only wearing a black t-shirt. One of the judges in the audience came up to me and asked if I was in another ethnic group. I told her I was in my ethnic group, but she still wrote down another ethnic group on my info sheet. Then Abigail and I were taking a break from the photo shoots and we went to the library, where we ate dried mangoes and peanut M&Ms. The next morning we all had to take showers, and I had 3 sponges, but no soap, so I wasn't able to. In my next dream I was skiing with my family somewhere, but I still needed a new winter coat. My mother and I were going to go shopping. I think it was Christmas or Thanksgiving or something, because this old woman was there and she was supposed to be my grandmother, but she wasn't. My father was making apple pie shaped into funny faces. My brother was making chocolate butter cream frosting. I had two pieces of this incredible cake (it tasted so good in my dream) before I felt like a pig and was so glad I had only eaten that in my dream and not in real life. My mother and I left for the mall. The car was parked in the backyard instead of in our driveway, but anyway. I tried on lots of different coats, but they only had sizes 29 and 32, which I don't even think are real sizes in women's coats. I ended up not finding anything and left. When I got home I had to baby sit some random family I've never met before. I brought 101 Dalmatians coloring books and two boxes of crayons, because I guess I knew there was a little girl who would want to color. When the parents came home, they were congratulating me on being accepted to medical school. The kid's uncle had three heads, and I tried not to stare. Then I woke up. (381 words)

Last night I had a series of weird dreams. First, Sydney and I were in our room and we were part of some game show with some of our friends and other random people I don't remember. Every time we got a question right, we took shots of vodka together. Mario was there too and kept warning us to be careful. Later, I was in Adam's with Sydney, Jillian, and Reese. We were trying to decide when we should go get sushi for dinner. I think it was after final exams, because I was running on a treadmill in Adam's, and didn't have a care in the world. Next, there was some sort of funeral or memorial. All the boys on the hockey team were wearing the same team tie, and had to recite a piece of a eulogy for this person who had died. I remember seeing Trevor and saying something about him to my father. He told me that Trevor wasn't his real last name; rather it was "Sierra" and he just went by Trevor because it sounded manlier. Although I was shocked, I think I knew this. I felt out of place that I did not have this blue silk team tie, or the equivalent, and I also wondered why I was at this memorial, since I didn't seem to know who had died. Next I was in a building in Manhattan somewhere. I had ordered pizza and the delivery guy was doing a dance outside my window. A-Wall was there too. We were hunting around in our garden (inside the apartment) looking for a plant that would in ten years grow to be my husband. Then I woke up. (283 words)

I had a dream that my family and I were all going somewhere, but I can't remember where it was or why we were all there. My mother and I wanted to go home early, so we took one of the cars. We were at a rest stop, when I realized that we had somehow taken both cars, but I hadn't been driving. My mother said she had been driving each car in shifts, because they were both some kind of new stick shift I didn't know how to drive yet. I was also dreaming about floating down some river with other RAs, and that was our mid-year training. Later, Gage and I were talking, and he was telling me about how every couple in our grade was breaking up before graduation. I was shocked, but really relieved that I wouldn't have that same problem.

I had a really elaborate dream last night that took place sometime in late May/early June, right between final exams and senior week before graduation. I think I was commuting between my home state and my college state for that last week because I was both at home and at my college . I think first, we had some big party to kick off senior week, but we also had something early the next morning, so people were trying to get to sleep. I was in a huge bedroom with Lyla, some other girls I can't remember, Miley, and Adam. I think Susanna was there too (in the abstract, not physically there), but she and Adam had broken up, or something. In any event, Adam was sleeping next to me in this bed, and he was tickling me and flirting with me, and I was trying to be quiet since everyone else wanted to go to sleep. Javier was there too, and some boy who introduced himself to me as "Lacrosse." Next, I was at home, and maybe my brother was graduating from high school again or something, because I was baking him a cake. It was a long, rectangular sheet cake with blue icing. I ran out of icing, so I had to make more, but no matter how much butter, cream cheese, or powdered sugar I put in, it tasted disgusting and came out this terrible shade of maroon. Finally I gave up, and just colored (with a blue marker) the parts that didn't have icing. Also, I remember it being extremely dark outside, even though it was early in the day. Maybe there was some kind of solar eclipse? So then I had to get back to my college , and my father told me I could bike there; it would take 2 hours to get to one town, and then I would have to walk 30 miles to the college town. This was crazy to me, and I couldn't understand how I was supposed to do that. I guess I got up there though, because there I was again in a Lily Pulitzer dress, flouncing around. There was a beautiful abstract expressionist painting on the wall, with the initials W.K. I knew it was Kandinsky, even though it didn't really look like his work. I think maybe it was some new, undiscovered painting, but it was beautiful --I wish it existed in real life! All of a sudden I was back at home again, asleep in my bed. I was dreaming (in my dream) that the reason Adam had picked Susanna over me was because she had sex with him, and I wouldn't. I guess in my dream this had happened to me a different time with a different guy, so it was a huge revelation. I woke up (in my dream) and got out of bed. I started applying black eyeliner to my eyes (I wanted to make Adam realize he should have chosen me) before realizing I hadn't washed my face or anything. Then there was a knock on my door, and I said, "Hold on!" while I grabbed a light blue robe (which I do not own) out of my closet. I opened my door and my father was there saying that my brother really needed us (I can't remember why), so I should probably not go back to my college today. Although Adam and my college and graduation had been on my mind only 20 seconds ago, I nodded fervently and said that yes of course I would stay at home if my brother needed me. My father said it was 10:30, so we should get going (to where, I don't know). Then I woke up in real life, and it was only 9:30, and my father had already left for work. (640 words)

I had the worst dream last night. It started out that I was at a party somewhere in some basement, at my college, but at a place that definitely doesn't actually exist. It was a huge labyrinth and very dingy and dimly lit. At the beginning, the party was fun. People were playing Beirut and there was music. I think it might have been a costume party because I think I was wearing a bumblebee or some other bug costume. Erick was there looking for me. I couldn't find him, but everyone else I saw told me he was looking for me. I saw notes written by him looking for me, notes like, "Bea, meet me upstairs." Anyway, the dream turned into a nightmare very quickly. All of a sudden we were running away from the building. It was daylight outside. People were screaming and running in every direction to avoid these gigantic machine monsters that were shooting people down like in District 9. Nora and I were trying to hide underneath a white plastic tarp. I was breathing so quickly and was so scared. I heard the machine's voice saying, "I can see your blue shoe underneath that white tarp. Come out now." I wondered if just maybe Nora was wearing blue shoes too, but she wasn't, and I knew the monster was calling for me. I waited until I thought maybe he had gone and then ran out to find my next hiding spot. I hid behind a wooden shed, but the second I peered around to see where the monster was, it shot me in the arm. It was really painful! I thought for sure I was going to die. All of a sudden I was lying on a gurney and being rushed back into the basement, which was no longer the site of a party, but a makeshift hospital. I couldn't move or speak, but I could hear the "doctors" around me saying I had almost no time to live, and discussing how they should take my organs now while they were still fresh. I was horrified and tried to speak to tell them that I was going to be fine, but they started draining blood and taking my organs. I don't remember the gory details, but I woke up in the same position (in my dream) after they had supposedly taken all my body parts. When I came to, however, I felt fine, as if nothing had happened. Even my costume was still intact. I was so happy I leapt off the gurney and raced around following the notes Erick had left me until I ran straight into him. I was so happy, but he looked terrified. He said we had to get out of here immediately. He brought me to some beautiful library with dark paneled walls, gorgeous built in shelves, and thousands and thousands of books. There were beautiful leather chairs, brass desk lamps, and huge skylights for the roof. It was dark and snowy outside, but cozy and warm inside. My whole family was there watching some National Geographic program about Siberian tigers. I started chatting online with Erick and some other friends. What was weird was that Erick was able to talk to me, but it was as if my other friends were ignoring me. I told Erick this and he said, "It's because you're dead." I distinctly remember my heart dropping as I realized this. He said that the only reason I could see him too was because the same thing had happened to him after he had been shot, and since we were both dead, we were on "the other side" and could talk to each other, but people who were still alive couldn't hear us. I guess I thought my family had been too absorbed in the TV to say anything to me when I got home, so I tried to see if they would acknowledge me now. I tried talking to my mother and brother separately, and then yelling at the top of my lungs "I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF" to see if that would get their attention. But Erick seemed to be right; they just couldn't hear me. I started crying and ran upstairs, which was my room, even though we don't have a library like that in our house. I found my hairbrush, which I also knew to be some kind of sniper rifle, and ran into my room to shoot myself. If I died again, it means I was actually alive, but if nothing happened, then I must be dead. It was the most horrifying feeling and I kept trying to wake myself up. I literally said to myself "Bea, wake up! Wake up! This can't be real!" I looked into my full-length mirror and shot myself in the temple twice. I heard the gunshot and felt the excruciating pain, but got up right after I had shot myself. I started sobbing, since I was really dead. I ran back to the basement where all that stuff had happened, hoping to find someone who could bring me back to life. I was crying and screaming and trying to find anyone who would listen to me for just a minute. I hadn't said goodbye to anyone, and all I needed was a few days on "the other side" so I could talk to the living. It was so horrible, and every time I tried to wake myself up, I couldn't, so I just decided that I must have not been dreaming. And then I woke up, thank GOD! (934 words)

Last night my dreams were not my own. I was confused and utterly clueless throughout the whole series. First I was in Mexico at the beach and stuck on some sort of movie set. Some blond girl was running around for a scene, so all the exits were closed off so people wouldn't come in. For some reason, I was trapped on the wrong side of this barrier, and all I wanted to do was go back to the beach. It was so warm and sunny that I was almost shocked when I woke up that I wasn't in Mexico. All of a sudden I was transported to some humungous house in the south of France with Abigail. There was a family there, but it wasn't my family and it wasn't Abigail's. Someone had some kind of disorder, and the family was making a video to send to a committee to get better hospital care for their kid. I was thrown into the middle of it, wearing some sort of costume, and having utterly no idea why I was there. Then Abigail and I were made to go shopping. We found a Wal-Mart (in the south of France). While we were shopping, Abigail started stealing other people's groceries that they had already paid for. The manager of the store caught us, but Abigail managed to get away. She caught me and started interrogating me. I began to cry until she said, "I know it was your friend, not you, so I'll let you go if you find her and turn her in." I didn't know what to do and only prayed that Abigail had run far enough away that I wouldn't find her and have to turn her in. Then I was in a classroom somewhere with Edwin and we were laughing and joking about something. Then I was at a ball somewhere wearing a long silver dress and Philip was trying to call me. I didn't want to talk to him so I snapped my phone in two. Then I realized I wasn't wearing a bra and became really self-conscious. Finally, there was some dog who was trying to follow me around, and I realized it was someone named Doug, a person I have never actually met in real life, but whom I knew in my dream to be my soul mate, who had the ability to transform into a dog. It was so strange and I honestly felt like I was just walking through a world of other people's dreams! (422 words)

I had a dream last night that I was back in my high school dining hall and Tony was there. My brother was there too and he was trying to get my attention, but I didn't realize. I was wearing a black dress and I think I had an exam or somewhere important to be. I also had to finish a book before wherever I was next going. (68 words)

I had a dream that I had accidentally booked spring break in Russia, instead of Mexico. When I got there, my father and I had to buy down vests, and all I wanted was for it to be warm. We were on a train to go shopping, but then I was on some pier in Brooklyn. Roberto was there and we were holding hands and walking down the pier. I jumped into the water, but it turns out it was actually this motor oil that could kill me. I was spluttering and swallowing the oil and trying to swim to the dock. I ended up spitting in real life, trying to get the oil out of my mouth in my dream. Then I was running on a staircase that was like the Guggenheim, except it was 14 stories. I tried to climb up the stairs, but the building was jello-like and really difficult to stand up. Anthony was there and he was so cute, and I felt like I was 14 all over again. (174 words)

I can't remember the exact order of my dreams. I think first I was going back to the city in Spain, where I studied abroad. We landed and immediately went to the Reina Sofia. There was a Willem de Kooning and Goncharova exhibit, except instead of their paintings, they were frescoes that were attached to the wall. And despite this, the paint still stuck out in thick brushstrokes. It was beautiful. The frescoes were oddly shaped, sort of like Frank Stella pieces, and they were all over the walls and ceiling. There were Picasso sketches that I am making up in my head right now, sort of curved cubism in reds and pinks, drawings I'll only ever see in my head. Anyway, I am walking around the Reina Sofia and I bump into Kit, Philip, Miley, and some other guys. I think Abigail was with me originally, but I was surprised to see these guys in Madrid. All of a sudden the Reina Sofia turned into this terrible maze, and there was this psychotic 12-year-old boy with a gun who was chasing us all around. I was now with a group of girls (none of whom were identifiable), and we were all tearing through this maze, which was perched on a mountaintop, so it was very precarious. A lot of the girls were shot. I dove under a table and went limp and tried to pretend I was already dead. Similar to the other dream I had, someone called me out on faking death. I was terrified and sweating, and sand was sticking to my face. I was trying so hard to cry silently and wake myself up at the same time. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't wake myself up. It was like I was literally stuck in this dream. Anyway, the kid who was killing everyone came up behind me and I cringed, waiting for him to shoot me, but then I leapt up and faced him. He looked scared, and I tried to calm him down and talk him out of killing everyone. He said he felt like a monster, and I tried to reassure him that he wasn't and that he was still young and just coming into himself. I somehow got out of that nightmare and found myself in the dining hall at my college waiting in the salad bar line. There was some guy behind me who graduated a few years ago, who I can't name, but I think I remember thinking he was cute. He was standing behind me and flirting with me as I made my salad, which was spinach, tomatoes, pesto, hard-boiled eggs, and chickpeas. When I walked to my table to sit down with my friends, I realized that it was graduation dinner, and I was horrified that I had somehow missed my last semester at my college. I tried in vain to ask someone what we were doing, or how it was May already, but everyone was drunk and crying, which wasn't helpful. Then I woke up. (510 words)

I had a dream that I was back at my high school and someone was painting a portrait of me, so I had to lie on this couch for a long time while I was being drawn. I could see a tiny scorpion walking around on the coffee table adjacent to me and became worried that it would walk up towards me! I was then somewhere with Alondra and was getting married to Channing Tatum. I was confused as to why we were getting married, when Alondra and Andre had been dating for 9 months and weren't even engaged yet. Alondra assured me that this was a good decision. I was wearing a veil and up at the altar. Alondra was behind me, pushing me along. Channing Tatum kissed me, which was fine, but I just didn't understand why I was getting married. Next, he and I were in some really nice boutique. I was picking out different lingerie slips and dresses. I didn't realize they were lingerie until I tried them on and they were completely transparent. I was horrified and ran home, where my dad was purchasing the portrait of me. It wasn't an oil portrait; rather it was some kind of moving lithograph print. My figure comprised of the Benday dots used by Lichtenstein, but I moved within the picture. It was actually one of the coolest things I have "seen." Anyway, then I woke up. (239 words)

Bea 2: a college student:#048 (01/31/2010)

I had a really scary dream that I was studying abroad in some small Italian town. I had a weird Italian cell phone that wouldn't make calls, only receive them. I went into my apartment one day and five strange men I had never seen before had broken in. I started feeling like I was choking on the air and couldn't breathe. I tried to grab a baseball bat nearby but it was stuck to the floor. I started freaking out and ran out of the apartment to some building where Michelle and Gus were. They assured me that everything was ok. I left to go do something but when I returned to their apartment, the five men were there too. I was really scared and found Andy, who drove me away. Then I woke up and fell back asleep and had a new dream. In this dream, I was walking through a giant shadowbox that had all these unknown Picasso figurines he had carved as a boy. I picked one up that was a little bird painted purple and yellow. It was so cute and sort of looked like a more cartoonish version of his neo-classical stuff. I was so amazed that I had never seen any of this before --what a disappointment to wake up and realize it's not real! (222 words)

I had the most vivid dream that I was in the bookstore buying a sketchbook for architecture. The paper was all different sizes and organized into pretty different colored binders. It was also spring weekend, so when I left, there were bands playing outside. Everyone everywhere was drunk and dancing and I became really sad that I was going to graduate soon. Also, I weighed myself in my dream and had gained 8 lbs --weird. (75 words)

I had a dream last night that started out as the absolute worst nightmare I have ever had, but it was a nightmare within my dream, so that when I woke up from the nightmare, I was still in my dream. In my nightmare, I was a mule for carrying drugs across the border to Turkey, Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Israel. There was this horrible, creepy, oily, and disgusting man in his 40s, who was my boss/drug lord/drug dealer. The drugs were some weird form of cocaine and ecstasy in this red and black pill that I hid under my breasts. In order to get across the border, my boss would pretend to be fondling me while he took the drugs out. I was crying the entire time, weeping, sobbing, and doing anything to get out of it. I ran into Kingston once when I was about to leave Kazakhstan to get more drugs. I made the most helpless, pleading face, and he got the point and saved me. He grabbed me and sprinted me across the border, where the guy couldn't bother me anymore. I was so relieved that I started crying and shaking and sweating, and I'm pretty sure that was happening in real life as I woke up from my nightmare into my dream. Next, I had a dream that I was studying Michelangelo's sketches for the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The original for The Creation of Adam was not the iconic image of Adam reaching out to God, but rather a sketchy cartoon of God holding Adam as if he were giving him the Heimlich maneuver. I was confused because I know the real version so well, but apparently this was a sketch that no one had ever seen before and was the real creation scene. (298 words)

I had such a vivid dream about graduation in May. First I think I was in the gym doing sit-ups and Keegan came in. I saw him in the mirror and my heart fluttered. I kept doing sit-ups and all of a sudden I was at the off-campus boys lacrosse team's house with Kit. We were dancing and kissing and it was fun. Then it was senior week (the week of festivities leading up to graduation) and I was running to the library in a blue dress. I think all the seniors had to gather there. I burst through the doors in the library and realized I was drunk. It was a strange feeling, because I think what I had been nervous about before was being late, not drunk. Kit was there wearing a pink and white striped haberdashery shirt and he hugged me and bemoaned the fact that we had never dated at college. He said he wanted to see me next week after we graduated, but I didn't want to for some reason. The inside of the library was constructed in a sort of Frank Lloyd Wright-esque way, in that there were all these steel rafters and open staircase shafts. The building was minimalist and modern and blended in with the environment so perfectly that the ocean waves were swelling up and crashing into the library walls. All of a sudden, I guess the entire setting changed and we were on Pandora, the planet in Avatar. There was a huge wave swelling up about to crash over, and I had to run all the way up to the top of the wave before it crested. I think I did, but then all of a sudden I'm right back in the middle of senior week. Alondra is doing stand-up comedy, but no one is laughing. I am waiting to hear the punch line to this piece she is doing, but I can feel myself waking up. I fight consciousness so hard until I hear the punch line, which was, "The musical, Les Miserables." It makes no sense to me now, but apparently it was hilarious and fitting in the dream. (361 words)

I had another dream it was senior week. This time a lot of the seniors who graduated last year were back. I guess I had decided not to go to "Circus Night," and instead Abigail and I packed up our rooms because we were leaving the next day. The next morning it was pitch black out, but it was definitely morning. Abigail and I waited outside for Lyla to pick us up. She was an hour late and when she showed up, she was wearing a sequined full body suit. She hadn't showered or changed, and this is the first time I can ever recall smelling in a dream. She smelled like beer and a late night out, but it was acute and I could smell it. Lyla explained to us that the reason she was so late was because she had been helping a freshman boy who had gotten lost somewhere. (152 words)

I had the most vivid series of dreams last night. First, I was at Tony's house watching some play or game show of sorts about the history of his family. His brother and sister were there, and I realized he also had another younger sister. The odd thing was that is family seemed a lot like mine --they were really close and played games together and it was very cute. Then I was in a car pulling out of the driveway, and I realized his house was in this steep, mountainous landscape that I have seen in other dreams as well. Then I had a really gross image of having a gigantic pimple on my cheek. I poked it and the white pus/goo just leaked out in a shiny, white, subcutaneous glob. (132 words)

Last night I had a very vivid series of dreams. First, I was talking to Keegan in what seemed to be his house. He was waiting for baseball practice and I was waiting for some other athletic event in the field house as well. We were just talking and it was fun! Then he said he wanted to introduce me to his mother, but since we had only met this semester, I figured he was just being friendly. Still, I was flattered and excited. But then I think we had to drive to the field house because his practice was starting soon. We drove over there and then that was the end of that. Then I was in my high school dining hall with Alondra and some random freshmen from college. I was trying to explain why this new painting called "Emily Combusted" was so important and innovative. It was on the front page of the New York Time Arts section. I was talking about how it was part of this new movement called "ir-realism," which is a post-modern sort of surrealism, a style of painting that encompassed the subconscious and wanted to investigate its inner workings, but did so in a more politically self-conscious way. The exhibition that was being reviewed in the Times comprised some hundred paintings that were like Dali paintings looked at through a microscope far away. The details were incredible, the anguish on Emily's face so powerful. It was new and fun and exciting seeing this art in the paper. 

Then my father was swimming in the Olympics and got a bronze medal! (268 words)

I had the most vivid dreams last night. I can't remember the order exactly, since they all seemed to be happening at once. First of all, I was going down to a store to interview again. My father was writing out this list of things I should wear and say in my interview, and it was really stressing me out. He told me to bring this special coat from Vienna, and I couldn't see how that would make a difference, but oh well. Then Tony and I were skating and playing hockey in the arena. We were sort of scrimmaging one on one, but we were also hooking up on the ice. It was a sort of violent passionate event. I would try to get the puck away from him in the corner, wedging his body up against the boards as much as I could, and then we would be on the ice, helmets off, going at it (not sex). Later, when I was changing in the locker room, I discovered that my entire right thigh was covered in hair. I was horrified, not understanding how that had happened. It wasn't even just regular leg hair that I could shave off; it was like fur. But it was only on my right thigh. Anyway, next I think I was down in New York for this interview at a store. Eleanor was there teaching a class that I may have had to go audit before my interview. There were 2 other girls who were identical to me who were also interviewing at the store, and I became very discouraged. I didn't know how I was going to make myself stand out. I had my alarm clock with me for some reason instead of my phone. Bryson and Tony started chatting with me through G-chat, but I got nervous I would confuse the two of them in my chats. Then I was in a Hallmark store trying to find an appropriate thank you card for the woman who interviewed me. This part was very vivid twenty minutes ago, but I can't remember much now. I think there were some kids from abroad there, but I can't remember. (365 words)

I had a dream that I was on a bus or train somewhere, can't remember. But I was really nervous I was going to miss my stop; maybe I had missed it the week before when I was making the same commute. Anyway, when I got off the train, I guess I was in the right place. There was some sort of party or gathering. But anyway, Calvin was there and I was supposed to hook up with him. I wanted to too, but there was some sort of understanding between the two of us that we were going to hook up, even though we've never talked before. It was as if we were just going to act on the sexual tension and there didn't have to be any sort of explanation. He was shirtless, but had on his white baseball cap. He was holding a peach colored silk sheet and was waiting for me or something. I think I was sort of confused, but I got back on the train and then I woke up. (176 words)

I had a dream that I was in some Health class or other with Tony and other sophomores. We had to give presentations that day, and I guess I had thought I was presenting much later, because I realized I wasn't prepared. I had to present on Lolita and then relate how that had to do with sexual abuse and rape. I had written some sort of song and had condoms with me to give out to the rest of my class. When my professor called on me, I panicked, but ended up having to present anyway. I think the presentation ended up going pretty well. Tony, as he was leaving, asked me out on a date and suggested taking me out to dinner. Of course I accepted, but then remembered that I was dating Philip. The next day, leading up to the date with Tony, I asked my friends if I should just break up with Philip, rather than cheat on him. I wondered why I was with Philip again since it hadn't worked out the first time. Then I was on a golf course wearing pink shorts and pink ankle socks and little golf shoes. I had on a white tank top and a pink ribbon in my hair, and I was skipping near where Tony was playing golf, flouncing and flirting and showing off. Then I had to drive a golf cart with Martin and one of his friends home. I was baking almond cookies that were not yet done, but I had already taken out of the oven. Martin and his friend kept trying to take them off the cookie sheet, which made me really frustrated. Then my_father came home from wherever he was and we were planning to have dinner at 7:30.

The first part of my dream that I remember took place in an old classroom where I might have had 3rd or 4th grade. Sue and I were there with my college baseball team. The coaches and athletic directors had chosen us as managers of the team, so we were there at their first meeting. The meeting started ordinarily enough; the coach gave some inspirational speech, but then the talk devolved to girls. I distinctly remember Keegan being there and looking absolutely perfect. I whispered something to Sue about him being the captain. Martin and Trenton were there too. All of a sudden, the power went out. Sue and I scrambled out of the room to the parking lot. First we stopped at a cafe outside the classroom and we ordered caramel macchiato. When I turned around, Keegan was there. I lamented that I couldn't remember where I had parked my car and asked him if he would please help me find it. He agreed; I purposely led him in the opposite direction of where I knew my car to be so that we could spend more time together. I must have looked cold because he took off his sport coat and draped it over my shoulders. We went on walking through this rainy forest until we found my car. We had been joking about cars and baseball and clothes, and the conversation seemed so real, the banter, the flirting...I'm amazed it was only a dream. Keegan opened my car door and threw some of his stuff in. I was sad when he started walking away, but then he looked back at me and said, "You're not driving off yet, are you? Come walk with me some more!" Delighted, I followed him down some ravine covered in ferns and we went on chatting and laughing. Next, I was part of some secret organization on campus that was trying to change the housing lottery system. We met in this secret cave off campus that no one could find unless he or she knew about it beforehand. There were about 30 of us and we had these secret files on CDs that we were trying to erase. Drake burst in the door and demanded that we hand over the CDs. I had them in my hand. Everyone yelled at me not to give them to him, but to just throw them in the fire. I looked hesitant, so someone grabbed them from me and threw them in the fire to destroy them. I immediately ran over and yanked them from the flames and gave them to Drake. He looked at me as if he were going to hit me and ran out. Everyone started yelling at me for giving them over. "You don't understand!" I yelled. "You will forgive me, but Drake may not." A few days must have gone by, and I was manicuring the lawn outside my house --literally manicuring it with a nail file. I was upset because Drake hadn't yet called me. I thought I should just give in and call him, but I didn't want to. Just then Mommy was mad at me, but I think Martin didn't know I had given away any secret information. He offered me some of his pasta and I took a bite. Later in my dream I was eating breakfast with Trenton at Pickering. Keegan came to join us and I was so happy! (573 words)

Last night I first dreamed that I had to throw another surprise party for Alondra and bake her a cake and buy her a camera. I really didn't want to since I had already thrown her a surprise party. I was in Wal Mart or something and then I realized that Sydney's birthday was coming up too. I wanted to do something for her so I bought a gluten-free cake too. Then I was at home and I think I had a test or something the next day. I was anxious about something. Drake came into my room and we were fooling around a bit. Then he left for a moment (to get water, maybe?) and I had the most intense orgasm I've ever had in real life or in dreams. It was so powerful and still going when Drake came back. I insisted that we have sex that instant, but then my parents walked in and it was horrible! Drake was mortified, and I was furious. I think my parents just tried to ignore what was happening. Drake was so embarrassed that we would have to have dinner with them later. (192 words)

I had a dreams last night that first I was in some school in Alabama learning to parasail. My teacher was very handsome and I had a crush on him. When the time came to leave, I hoped he would volunteer to help me parasail back to my home state. He didn't, and I was left to figure out how to work the parasail by myself. It was only supposed to take me 4 hours to get home, and I had to get home that night since my interview in New York was the next day. I landed in Tennessee by accident and was trying to figure out how to get back in the air when I started a new dream. I was walking to Pickering from spinning class with Abigail. I saw Keegan on the way but I don't think he saw me. Then Abigail and I were standing outside Pickering talking to someone and Keegan turned back and we definitely made eye contact. He spread his arms as if he wanted me to hug him, but I was too far away. Then I went inside Pickering: Andy, Alvie, and Professor Simms were all there too. I think Alvie was taking the GMATs the next day. Andy and I were walking around and he spilled his food and I think I might have woken myself up laughing. (228 words)

I guess my first dream was that my family and I were back in Mexico. Keegan was there and I was subtly trying to get his attention. There was some sort of art auction happening, so I had my father sell this Dali painting that we had. I knew that Keegan lived on 43rd street in New York, so I tried to get my father to sell the painting to a gallery in midtown so that I would have an excuse to be around there. I think he did, but I can't remember. Then I was tanning on the edge a black infinity pool and Keegan was across the pool. I was trying to pretend I didn't know he was there, but it was pretty obvious that I did. I think I was then sitting next to him and I all of a sudden felt very chagrined, so I must have done something to embarrass myself. All of a sudden, there was some announcement throughout all Puerto Vallarta telling everyone to pack up his or her most prized possessions in a bag because a dangerous con man was coming through all the resorts and taking everyone's stuff. Only now all of a sudden, I didn't have to just zip up my suitcase, but rather we were at home and I had to pick only a few things that were that important to me. I think I threw in my iPhone and laptop, figuring that any burglar would only want those items rather than the more sentimental things. I think my father threw nothing in. When the burglar arrived, we all sat downstairs in the family room while he ransacked our house, picking out things he wanted to take. He took some of my mother's jewelry, my father's laptop, iPod, and wallet. I think at one point my father tried to say no and the burglar pulled out a gun and loaded it. He aimed it at my father and Martin and I both burst into tears, sobbing and screaming. I distinctly remember thinking "I won't have a father in a few minutes." I was crying so hard, but I never heard the gun shot. I realized that the burglar was just using it to instill fear in all of us. I offered to take him up to my room and let him go through all my CDs in order to distract him from my father. We went upstairs and the burglar demanded an Akon CD. I frantically rummaged through everything and never found the Akon CD. The burglar ran back downstairs and started lighting all our photo albums on fire. It was then that I realized that my laptop and iPhone were completely replaceable, but those photos were not. Then I was back in Art History 101 and hadn't studied for my final exam. I think I thought I had, but in reality I had never made flashcards or reviewed for the essays. I went into the exam and opened my blue book. The slides flashed on the screen, and I was only able to identify 4 of the 10. I reassured myself that I could make the points up on the essays, but then I realized I didn't know anything about the objects. To make matters worse, I was writing with a gigantic indelible marker, which was clumsy and awkward to hold. I could only fit a few letters in per page of my blue book. Finally, Professor Durkin came over and asked how I was doing. I told him truthfully that I was doing horrible and had not prepared for some reason and also that I had this horrible marker to write with. He helped me talk out some of the themes in "Hanging Lantern," a performance piece that I completely made up in my head. I wrote out "seeking to but failing to find one's own voice" on my leg in pencil. I guess he had given me a pencil to replace the gigantic marker and rather than ruin another blue book, I decided to write my answers all over my skin. Then I woke up. (689 words)

I had the worst dream last night! So I think I was in some very random location but there was a bookstore on the hillside. Some anonymous friend and I decided to spend the night in the bookstore and read all night and just browse. So when the owner left and locked up, my friend and I just stayed. The bookstore must have been haunted or somehow possessed because that evening was really weird. First we were running through a labyrinth of human body parts. The walls were made of feet and toenails and animal claws, and everything was red and raw and smelly. There were plants made of human skin and body parts, but for some reason I just told my friend to ignore it and that it wasn't a big deal. It started raining at some point, and we took refuge at Bugler House. Some of the guys were there and wanted to party, but we didn't want to, so we went back out into the human body part maze. Then, and I don't know how this happened, but I was being raped somewhere. I think within the bookstore there was a mall or store of sorts and I was trying on clothes and some random man came in and forced me to give him head. I was crying and trying to fight him off, but he was a lot bigger than I was and was forcing himself into my mouth. I was sputtering and choking and trying to scream and it was horrible. As soon as I ran out of the dressing room after being raped in multiple ways, I ran into a street and a bus ran over me. Seriously. I felt the bus try to stop and I crumpled down as the wheels passed over me and the bumper scraped into my chest. I must have been lying on my stomach in real life because I definitely felt a physical pressure on my body and was finding it hard to breathe. I think everyone around me thought I was dead and was trying to figure out how to get rid of my body, but I knew I was still alive and was trying to yell out that I just needed to go to the hospital, but no one could hear me since I was completely winded. My friend and I found ourselves back in the bookstore and realized it was morning. We tried to leave before the owner found us, but as we were leaving, we saw police cars parked outside and knew we had been caught. The owner was striding slowly toward us carrying this long rifle. My friend and I were racing to get out and around the building and hide, but we were moving so slowly for some reason. Neither of us could just get going and it was painful to watch him approaching ever closer. He caught up with us and made us get on our knees as he held the rifle to the backs of our heads. We were crying and pleading with him not to shoot us. I had a distinct thought of "I can't believe I have been raped, hit by a bus, and am going to be killed all in one day." I was sobbing and thinking of my family. Then out of the middle of nowhere, this man and wife saved us. They knew the owner and told him they would take us into custody at their house. I was so relieved and grateful that I said I would do anything to earn my stay at their house and that I was just so elated to have been rescued. Well their house turned out to be a terrible orphanage. They told me my parents had died and wanted me taken care of, so I had to stay with them. They only ate steamed cabbage and pasta with no sauce and lived in the smallest, dirtiest apartment. They had some other orphans with them, plus my friend and me. Part of my keep was to clean the apartment, which was impossible because it was perpetually dirty, and I had to be the sex slave of the man. It could have been a few days later, or a month later, but I heard a knock at the door one morning. The "father/master" opened the door and it was my father! I was so happy I tried to yell out to him, but my owner said I had passed away. I was shouting and trying to draw attention to myself, and my father was so upset. I became so upset and started crying. I couldn't believe that my owner had lied to me about my parents dying, and that I could leave now forever and for some reason I was just physically stuck and couldn't make any noise. It was so horrible and I honestly thought it was the worst combination of things that could ever happen to me. I was so happy to wake up. (837 words)

I was at my parent's house that I grew up in and I was going out with a friend that I have here. I saw the house in fairly clear detail as if I were seeing it, and I went out with my friend to her house which was another large place with a lot of stairs. Again there were a lot of visual details. I could see a lot of colors in the rooms, the colors of the carpeting and the furniture and all the different shapes and different lighting as we moved from room to room, and she and I were talking, I don't remember what about, and I got to the top of a long flight of stairs inside the house and I was looking around and I said to her something like I forgot to close, to lock the front door of my house and that I had better go. And I had forgotten to lock the door of my house, but mostly I just wanted to go home, so we went back down this really long flight of stairs, and I don't remember if I had my brace on, that I wear, or not, just for some reason I was focusing on the stairs a lot. She does in fact have a long flight of stairs leading into her house, but they are outside not inside. (231 words)

I was back in the house that I grew up in and there was a child there who I was supposed to be looking after, who appeared to be 5 or 6 maybe. Who didn't appear to like me very much. Then again, the visuals on the house appeared to be very clear and although I could see the child... not with any clarity, just sort of a vague form, but I can't recall any facial features, I could hear her voice and the inflections of her voice, she didn't come very close to me. I don't remember particularly what I said to her but just remembered feeling very awkward which I guess I do around most children, in any case... at one point I was going out to get our family dog. To get our dog we used to have to go through the kitchen, into the garage, out back to where he was tied up. So I left the child in the house and went out to get the dog, I came back in and the child was sitting at the dining room table, and I could see her there, vaguely, and I could hear her talking to my sister who was sitting with her and they were coloring and I was somewhat relieved that my sister was with her because my sister was always much better with children, but I had also felt somewhat hurt that the child would sit with her and play with her but not with me.

Right before waking up I remember standing in the kitchen of that house and my mother and my grandmother were there, that is my mother and her mother and my mother asked; "what would you like to do, go for a walk or go using your wheel chair?" And I was somewhat anxious about going at all, I really didn't want to leave the house, but I thought to myself that it would be easier to use the wheelchair, but I needed the exercise so "I guess I'll walk" I said to my mom, "I guess I'll walk." And I was looking in the refrigerator while I was waiting for my grandmother to be ready to go, because my grandmother was also going to go on the walk with me. I was looking in it and seeing the different foods, and the light, the way it came on in our fridge when I was younger and I could still see. And people were talking, I don't remember who exactly, but they were discussing a recipe which sounded especially unappealing to me, something about some low fat chicken parts or something and my mom was talking about replacing that with beef and how it didn't work very well.

Last night I dreamed that I went back to school, to college, and I was moving into my dorm room and all my friends were still there, moving into their rooms, there was a lot of noise, a lot of people moving around, it was moving day. My suite-mate L was there, my friend J. I could see the room, the color of the carpeting, just the lighting and all that, the way I had always seen it in my head when I lived there, and I had been asleep and I woke up and this woman, actually two women came into the room, some of my friends were in the room too. And these women were telling me that I had to move all my stuff out, because they had a housing shortage and in the housing lottery I had drawn a place to live, but it was a tent in the parking lot and I was really, really upset because it was going to be winter soon and it was getting to be cold, and besides, I was in the room that I had been in all along and it was nice and I wanted to stay there and I told them: "Look, you better see what you can do because I'm arthritic and I can't live outside, even in a tent, especially in winter I just can't." And they were just basically saying, "well that's just tough luck" and I said "You know I realize that, but I just can't live under those conditions and I'll transfer out of this school but" I said, "in the mean time I'm going to sue you for discrimination if you keep this up and force me to transfer". And they began to get really annoyed and silent and sullen at that point I could see them vaguely, I couldn't see their faces, one was sort of heavy set and shorter and the other was taller and a tiny bit overweight. One was wearing a white cotton sweater, I can't remember what the other was wearing. I also remember something else which might have been part of another dream. (358 words)

There was a book published, like a book of essays and the authors of these particular, essays were going to get together and do a public reading of the book, each author was going to read their one of their essays that were in the book. And I had several essays in the book and I was trying to decide which one to read. Only I was reading it in print, I was, I had to get fairly close to the page, the way I had to when I was younger to see the print, but I was reading the print book. I was trying to select an essay and I was reading bits and pieces of different essays and trying to decide. I was in I guess it was some sort of conference room, I wasn't sure what kind of room it was, it had a sort of very thick, plush, maroon carpet and large tables and really big windows. It was a really huge room. (167 words)

I had a weird sort of dream, I was stuck somewhere, in a doctor's office, like in an exam room, waiting for a long time and then I left. The whole office had a sort of maroon carpeting and looked like it had been a really big house at some point or something and then I walked out of the exam, the whole office, I was wandering around this big long hall and it was carpeted the same way and it had big huge windows lining the whole hall I think on both sides, and it looked kind of late out, not like real sunny and I guess I was there a really long time because a nurse came out from the doctor's office and said that I'd been there a really long time and did I have a ride home, and I suddenly realized that I didn't, that I hadn't made arrangements with the patient transport [company] to go home and that it was after 5 and I couldn't and besides, I needed 24 hours notice. And so I was wandering around the halls of this really big building looking for a phone and I think I remember going back into the doctor's office and calling D, my husband, but he was staying with his brother and his mother and I guess because his van broke or something and that he had gone to bed and I so I was wandering around this building, and all of a sudden I was with somebody. And they kept changing who they were and they changed from my best friend in grade school through high school to my best friend from high school through college, and my best friend now, and they kept switching from one person to the other and we were going all around this building and somehow we ended up in my old church, outside the sanctuary and I started to go down the stairs to the lower hall of the church and I said to my friend "I've got to find a phone, I wish I could find a phone" and the church was lit, like it always was when I could see, but it was late like it looked at night. Then she called me and said "there's a phone right here". And so I went back up the stairs, but I felt kind of scared or anxious about going back, and then I got to the phone and found that I didn't know how to use it, I finally figured out how to use it and began to dial it and I dialed 4-6 and then I realized I was dialing my parent's old phone number and that they didn't live there anymore, and they were really far away and they couldn't help me anymore and I hung up and I started to cry and I said to my friend, "nobody can help me, nobody can help me I don't belong here" and I went down this back hall which used to belong to the nursery school that was held at our church, and I was crawling down the hall and I came up to this room and I was still crawling, and I went in but it was my next door neighbor's play room from when I was little. I was crawling across the play room and I was, there were toys everywhere, like on, all over the floor like there always were there, but I wanted to get up on the couch for some reason, it looked kind of like mid-afternoon in the playroom, I think there was something else, in the playroom, like some other scene which I'm not remembering... Then my friend came back in later and I crawled back over to her and I curled up against her and I was crying "I want to go home, I want to go home" and she wasn't saying anything, but I thought that she was thinking that I was crazy for acting like a little kid.

I was in my parent's old house and it looked somewhat like the basement did, the whole house was really dark and there was some sort of gathering of S people (a social club, a refuge for survivors of abuse). And there were like people everywhere and I was wandering around, listening to different groups talking, and finding out who they were and the basement was sort of dimly lit with a kind of yellow incandescent bulb in the ceiling. And there were people sitting on the stairs I knew, some friends I knew from college. That was really weird, and so I stopped to talk to them for a while and then I went upstairs into this kitchen which wasn't my parents' kitchen. And it was really dark in there with candles and stuff lit and there were these people and one of them I recognized as being a member of S. Guess they probably all were but, I recognized one who goes by the name Shadow Dancer. And he said something about do you want to join us and for some reason I had it in my head that they were witches and I wanted to belong but I didn't want to be part of it even though I didn't think they were doing bad magic. Anyway, I didn't like the idea of witchcraft of any sort and I said "no"... I was supposed to fly home and it was much later than I thought, and I felt really bad because I hadn't called my parents. I was walking everywhere in the house, looking for a phone. (269 words)

I had a dream I was in a mall and I was shopping with my friend X from S [the club] and this guy who was with X but I don't think it was her husband. I was in a wheel chair and so was she and we were going through this store. A section of the store with lots of clothes. It wasn't all a clothes store and it had sort of the usual mall kind of lighting. And it was quiet, not too quiet, like the store was carpeted so it was not too echoey in there. For some reason I decided to walk to the next store, I was walking with my sister and we were in the next store and walking around and I realized that I left my wheel chair in the last store and someone went back to get it and then somehow we ended up, X and I were parked next to the front of the store where it goes into the mall, like this really wide area, we were just parked there in our wheelchairs and this guy who was with X, and so was my sister, said something to X and she said something back like "we'll talk about it later" and she sounded like a little kid. And I said "okay". And the guy said something to us like, "you know, you two used to be so normal until you started hanging out together." And I realized I was sucking on my hand like a little kid and I took my hand out of my mouth and felt really stupid. And X said "You should be glad, at least we survived". (279 words)

I was in my old high school and I was sitting at a table in the hallway, guess no classes were in session. It was just a regular school table, I could see everything, the lockers and the doors, I'm not sure what I was doing at this table. I could see the yellowy track lighting that most schools have and I had a bunch of papers, I'm not sure what I was doing at this table, or doing back in high school, I graduated in '88, but I was back and was supposed to be back in classes, and the bell rang, so I took all my stuff off the table and I called Oval, my guide dog and I realized that I forgot to put her in harness, so she had no harness and no leash, and there was no way she could guide me and I had no idea which class I was supposed to go to next, but I knew that I was really, really behind in all my classes. So I went to the room that I used to go to where I had all of my books and my Braille equipment and stuff so I went to the room with her and closed the door. And it was a real mess in there, there was junk everywhere, like it had been there for a really long time. There were textbooks everywhere, it was dark, there were no lights. So I turned on a radio, and I was looking through some of my books and just feeling completely confused and overwhelmed and I knew that I must have been failing nearly everything. Some guy came into the room and he sat down besides me and he said something to the effect of "we've been discussing you and we think that you ought to go home" and I said "why?" and he said because none of the other students can just retreat to there little room. They don't have a little room like this. Everyone else has to go to the cafeteria and study and everybody is always so sympathetic to you and no one else gets breaks like you do and its unfair to the other students and you should go home". While he was talking to me he put his arms around me like I was a little kid and he apologized for upsetting me. Something about him having issues of his own. The principal came in and he looked at us and then he left. (422 words)

I was with my best friend, X and we were preparing for a 3 day weekend, like Friday, Saturday and Sunday only all I had with me was my backpack and I hadn't packed anything. We went to the kitchen and we chatted for a while and then we went into this huge bedroom. It had several king-sized or queen-sized beds scattered around the room. Lots of big windows, high up. It was really light or white in there. I was really agitated because I'd forgotten my medication, so she called her doctor and I was listening on another phone, and she asked him if he could get her some medication for while I was there and he said to her "I'm really glad you called, X, I'm really concerned about your blood work" and he talked to her about it. I pulled the phone away from my ear and thought that it might be a bad thing to listen or by listening something bad would occur. I went back out to the kitchen which was small and dark and confining. Like it was paneled with some kind of dark wood. And her 2 kids were there, in there 20's and they kept looking at me like I was something really strange and they wouldn't talk to me so I went back to the bedroom, feeling stupid for not packing anything. And suddenly there was my family, having a party in the kitchen, where I was hiding away from. This guy from a soap opera I watch, showed up and he like picked me up and put me on the bed and pinned me down and I wasn't scared, he didn't do it in a hostile way. He sort of pinned me down in a sexual domination kind of thing. I went back out to the kitchen and then the patio and there were some people there I didn't know, and I didn't want to be outside, but I didn't want to be inside by myself either, so I went outside. And no one even knew that I was there. That's it. (352 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was talking to a person who is bringing her cat over today for a visit before she leaves him with me in his new home. The dream was really similar to our last conversation in terms of arranging the time that he was to visit, but then she asked me if I had plenty of toys and I felt disappointed because she had told me previously the cat was a quiet cat and not very playful and I said 'yes I do, but I thought that you said that he's not too playful'. That's where the dream ended (104 words)

I dreamed that I was coming out of the upstairs bathroom in my parents house and as I was standing out in the hallway, listening, I heard the TV blaring, and it was a news magazine like 20/20 and the topic was Job Searching. I groaned inwardly and thought 'oh great, here we go again' because now my parents were going to bring up the whole issue of finding a job. And I don't want to discuss it. (78 words)

I had a dream that I was standing in a rehearsal of my community chorus for a concert and we were dancing as we were singing a mellow Carpenters number and I was relieved to find that I was following everyone else's movements and not out of step with them. Our conductor asked a friend of mine, R, a recovering anorexic, to stand up and speak some words about the disorder in the middle of a song, but she never got up and because I didn't hear her speak I thought to myself: "why is she not getting up?" and speaking the way she's supposed to be.

The Mystic River Chorale, which is my community chorus, was rehearsing in a classroom where we usually hold rehearsals on Monday nights and for some reason we began to sing Vivaldi's (Biachishpere?) and as we were singing it I looked through my folder of Braille music sheets and said "wait a minute! Its not in there, why are we singing this again, we just sang it last Christmas , this isn't appropriate for spring" and yet on second thought, I said, "Well, we'll be able to hear Tracy and Jenny sing again during the solos so that'll be good".

I dreamed that my mom and I went to an Easter service of my church and LS drove us. We got there and it was the auditorium of a local high school and we sat down in the upholstered chairs of the auditorium. There was no one there yet and I thought "Why isn't anybody here?". LS went to find out why there wasn't anybody there and when the service would start. So she went off to find some information, and while my mom and I sat there I took out a box of Snackwell's crackers, that were spiced with pepper and we started to eat and I thought "Why are we doing this, these are supposed to go to my dad for Father's Day" and I felt intensely guilty for bingeing on the crackers that were earmarked for a present. And then, as I sat there eating, I heard at the back of the room on someone's boom box, an evangelical broadcast and thought to my self, "why aren't we doing this, we're supposed to be having a service and we're not doing it, here I am listening to the radio and its got this religious broadcast, and we're supposed to be doing this and why aren't we and why aren't there anybody here? Where is LS and why hasn't she come back?" (224 words)

Last night I dreamed that I received a Braille letter from the agency that I was applying for a job with, and it said that I had been refused the job in favor of a guy named George C... I didn't know the name, because he was involved with some local political activity and other things that I knew about. I said "well that's good, he should be more suited for the job than I am" so I was glad that he got the job and not me. I was also really relieved because I really didn't want the job even though I had applied for it. (107 words)

I went shopping with a friend, LV, and I looked in this clothing store, through a rack of summer type sweater-vests, but instead of getting one of those, I ended up buying for myself a wind-breaker textured summer vest and took that home. When I got home, instead of entering through the front door, I entered through the basement door and heard some commotion going on upstairs, some people talking and bustling around and I wondered what was going on. But I turned around, and after setting my vests down went outside because I knew that I had some friends from church waiting to take me to an outing in the afternoon and yet I couldn't resist finding out who was upstairs and why and so I turned back around, went back inside, closed the doors and went upstairs and discovered it was my parents putting up stair treads that they had planned to put up sometime this year and had never gotten to. They were also painting, which I didn't expect them to do. I asked them about it and they said "oh, we're just here, doing a lot of stuff this afternoon" and I said "well that's all right, but I'm not going to be here this afternoon, I'm going back out to a church function" and they said "well that's all right, we don't need you here but can we make tuna fish sandwiches for this afternoon when we break?" And I said, "yeah, you can do that I have plenty left" and I went outside to find my friends still waiting for me and that was it. (271 words)

Last night I dreamt that my daughter M gave me a mothers day gift, and it was a basket or a bowl, I don't remember now filled with fresh shelled peanuts and I couldn't eat them for some reason I wasn't allowed to eat them and down in the center of the peanuts, in a box, nicely wrapped, in white paper tied with a blue ribbon. And she told me to open my gift and I did and there were 2 place mats. I don't know how they fit into that small box but there they were. One end of the place mats was beautifully cross-stitched, they were Irish linen and the cross stitching was green and black, the linen was an unbleached color like a muslin, they were not very pretty but she was so pleased that I told her they were just lovely.

I dreamt that I ran out into the street. I heard a fire engine, a sirens. This huge, bright red fire truck came into view and apparently stopped. It was empty in back, it was just like a dumptruck in back. No hoses, no ladders, no Indian tanks, no equipment at all, but there were 3 or 4 men in the back of it. The cab was immense, it was like the truckers' rigs that you see now, like they're carrying a living room with them. One of the men said, "I bet there are no peanuts on the floor in the front." I don't know what he meant but that's what he said. And the rescue unit went by and when it did, by now I was sitting down, and when it went by it rattled whatever I was sitting on so badly that my head got bumped several times. (151 words)

Dreamt of a flat, good sized box, and again I believe my daughter gave it to me. It was not a gift. It had quite a high priced price tag on it. I opened the box and inside were 6 bars of soap. So pretty, so lovely, and they were interspersed with designs between them. They were not neatly arranged, just random, with no pattern and I wanted so desperately to buy that box of soaps because I love nice soaps and I kept looking at the price tag and I couldn't see the price and I knew they were expensive and so I didn't buy the box of soap. I believe they were blue, a pale blue, and the designs which lay between the niches had roses and other flowers, pink roses and yellow roses and blue flowers and green leaves and just really pretty box of soap.

I was playing an organ at a funeral and I thought it went very well, but apparently someone was very unhappy about it because a man, and I have no idea who the man was, left the funeral home with me and we walked along a very deserted road, and it was bitterly cold. I had on my woolen winter coat which goes below mid-calf and its a very comfortable coat, but its awkward and heavy. And the wind was blowing and it was raining all of a sudden the man with me said "Run P! That car is chasing us!" We began to run, and it was very difficult for me in that coat and I tripped and stumbled, I didn't fall and the man grabbed my arm and pushed me up against a tree. He said, "stand there with your back to the road and he won't be able to see us." And it was very, very dark and the headlights of the car kept coming closer and closer and I woke up terrified and shaking like a leaf. (181 words)

Last night I dreamed that F and his wife L visited me on their way up to [a veteran's hospital] F is going to speak at the BVA meeting (blind veterans association). And he said, "come out into the hall", and here were cases and boxes of paper towels and toilet tissue, a piece of heavy, heavy metal which looked like an old fashioned wringer that would fit on a washing machine, and it had a separate motor on it and for some reason I was just delighted to see that and we were actually out in the hall of this building, the corridor, whatever and he helped me carry in the cases of paper goods, I don't know what L was doing. We came in and she was getting something out of a cupboard. She was wearing a bright red dress, and she has very short, very black hair and very trim, neat little figure and this bright red dress just enhanced her looks and all of a sudden a great big dog came around the corner and F said "oh, I brought my dog" and the dog came up to me and rubbed against me and I said to it "oh I bet you're hungry, I bet you haven't been fed". I had a can of dog food in the refrigerator, opened, with part of it taken out, I have no idea where that came from because I don't have a dog. I can remember saying to them, that I'm really not much of an animal lover, but this is a beautiful dog. I turned around and we chatted and I made plans to go up to the VA hospital, and I asked if we could stop and eat breakfast along the way and the answer was a very solid "No, we won't have time" and I was bitterly disappointed.

I dreamed that I was romantically involved with a young man, comparatively young, middle 30s or 40s. I felt completely attractive and as though I fully deserved the affections of this young man, who's name I do not know. We went many places together and did many things together. He would hold my hand whenever we were walking, and if we were in a room, he would involuntarily hold me in his arms and caress me, my hair, and kiss me but very dispassionately. There were no sexual implications at all. In this particular part of the dream I was getting dressed to go out with him somewhere and he came into the room while I was getting dressed and I said "don't come in, I'm getting dressed" and he came in and said that we were going to go to this house on the outskirts of town, and I said "all right, I'll be ready in just a few minutes" and he left and my son came in and talked to me about something and whatever it was didn't make much sense and he left, and the strange thing was that my son was his age, 39, but I was still the "younger woman". Eventually I got dressed. I had showered and done all the feminine things, the deodorant, the cologne and so forth and met the young man and walked hand in hand for quite a distance, to a beautiful street where there were all theses old sea captains houses, like we have on the coast of Maine. The street was lined with these houses on both sides of the street and we walked by many of them and finally came to one that was more like a southern plantation with the pillars in the front supporting a balcony. And we went around to the side of this house and we entered a door and climbed a flight of stairs and there was a door at the top and he had a key which unlocked the door, and we walked into a room with very high ceiling, no carpet on the floor, but an ugly brown chair, and an ugly blue chair... I don't remember any draperies, and there was a big old television set in one corner, obviously an old, black and white and he led me through a door into another room, which was totally unfurnished, it was quite a maze of rooms actually, all empty of furnishings except that first one. There was pealing paint on the walls which I believe were painted white, but that's not very vivid now, and he left me to go somewhere and a friend of his came in and asked me how I like the apartment and I said that it could be very nice if it was fixed up and a couple, a man and a woman, presumably his wife, and a little boy came in and walked into another room, which I assumed was a bedroom, they were very, very tired, and they put the boy to bed in another small bedroom, and they disappeared and I can't describe them to you, and I stood in a hall and leaned up against a wall, and I was very nicely dressed, I had on black panty hose, and nice black shoes, a dark gray skirt with a black sweater, some earrings and I felt as though I looked very nice. And across from this hallway there was good-sized hole in the wall, 6 or 8 inches in diameter and down the floor came a good sized spider, and I am deathly afraid of spiders, and I just cringed up against this wall and shouted to this friend of my friend to please come and kill this spider and he said "get real, I don't like them, I'm afraid of spiders too". So he didn't come to help me and the spider just came closer on the opposite side and he tried his best to dig his way in under the wall. He couldn't, and he only had 4 legs. And he had an oval, red patch on his back, but when he climbed the wall to get up to this hole, it turned to be gray and fuzzy. And when it looked in this hole and then tilted down, clinging to the rim of this hole with his back legs, and when he lurched up and he had a very small mouse in it's 2 front legs and he tipped the mouse up and opened his mouth and the blood ran out of the mouse's mouth and into his. And I began to gag and retch and thankfully woke up. (782 words)

I had another dream earlier about F again, he and I were in a room. I think, just standing and talking and all of a sudden he said, "Oh, I get it!" and he looked up and d here was this shelf with 2 hats on it, one was his and one was mine; a red baseball type cap with the Marine emblem on the front, like I bought at the PX of the [veterans hospital]. His was like a felt hat that men wear in the winter but it was made of straw and it was on top of my hat, and apparently this was a very sexual thing to him because he turned to look at me and he said "I know why you did that" and there was a sexual tension in the air and you (the researcher) walked into the room and looked at us and looked at the 2 hats and began to laugh.

The floor was wooden, uneven planks and I was applying for a job and I stood at a counter, an old styled counter that you would see in and old store and filled out many, many papers, applications, I guess they were and then a middle aged, kind of nondescript man said you have to come upstairs and talk to the personnel manager. So we climbed 5 flights of stairs and this was the very top of the building; a very, dirty and dusty and uneven wooden floors and he led me down a long empty room, and there on a wide, wide windowsill, sat my daughter, writing something with a pen and paper. She was sitting in the sunlight and it was shining on her beautiful blond hair, and she turned with a wide smile and said "hi mom! I've been waiting for you." (159 words)

Somehow we would score the Monopoly game by the hands of the cards we were dealt.

The I jumped from sorting balls of yarn to dress making in my mother's bedroom which had pale green curtains, the bed that she and my father slept in, and all their furniture, but I was trying to use a pattern and cut out a jacket or a blazer for myself and I cut all the pieces out and held them up and where I had folded the fabric, there wasn't enough so that the front of this jacket was very , very short and could not be used. This took place in a house in a very remote part of southern Maine called UF, a town which had a power station where my dad was the superintendent of and in this dream I looked out the bedroom window, which I often did, and I could see the power station and the Saco river behind it, its really a lovely view and it was very real in this dream and there were all kinds of construction workers who were milling around down at the power station which is called Q Dam.

The dream is not clear, even when I first woke up, apparently I was either visiting or living with some women, all women, in the dream I knew who they were but now I don't. I had been somewhere and I came back with 2 or 3 suitcases and we were sitting around a table talking and I was telling them about my trip and suddenly it hit me that I had been back for a day or more and I hadn't called my husband, apparently in this dream we were still married. Someone else called him and in the next sequence was him sitting at a table with a can of beer in front of him and he had been drinking, very obviously from the look on his face, I remember that look very clearly and he was very sweet in the dream, very nice and he understood why I hadn't called him because I was excited about the trip and coming back , and then we were in a bedroom, I think, preparing to go to bed and there were sliding glass doors and they were covered with draperies and I opened the draperies and that's the end of that dream.

The shelves were very well stocked and I waited on several customers and then it became some kind of a night club I guess because there was a line of female exotic dancers led by a male dancer all of them dressed in really fancy skirts and tops, and they came out and began to dance in a single line and it was very acceptable in my dream, it was apparently part of a show that this store put on for customers. But when they turned around and danced with their backs to the audience, the women and the man were all naked to the waste. He was very brawny a lot of hair on his chest, very muscular, I can't remember his face at all if I saw it. The women's breasts were coming out from under their arms, were down at their navel very, very peculiar looking breasts, and from there I was in a long room, looking up at a kind of cage, quite a way above my head, but I could have reached it if I had stretched. It had a glass front and was perhaps 3 feet long and perhaps a foot deep. And there were things inside it which I had to get. On the left side there was a bright yellow something which I had to reach inside and get but curled near it was a huge reptile of some sort. Probably a circumference of 20 inches at least around his middle, very, very frightening and I drew my hand back and when I did, it startled him and he came out of the cage it did not have a grid over it. It fell to the floor and became 2 very, very small hippopotami and they were very small and very menacing, and they began to chase me and I was frightened and finally, the room wasn't that big except there was a flight of stairs facing out of it and I decided to turn and face them and I turned around and gave them both a good kick. And they started to bleed, one from the mouth and one from under his chin and they were very subdued and tried to climb the flight of stairs, but because of their kicking injuries, they were unable.

Last night I dreamed that I was in a group of people, men and women and children and we were on the shore of a very attractive lake which did not look at all familiar to me. Everyone was in the water at times, and somebody brought me a very peculiarly shaped, rubber boat of some type, and I just fir perfectly into it. It was inflated and I could remember my feet just slipped into and made it into a place which was made for someone's feet. The whole thing seemed to be made for my body in a sitting position.

I had the care of a small child, I don't know if the child was mine or someone else's. In the beginning the child, a little girl, was lying on her back, very asleep, and a coverlet laying askew. I carefully placed the coverlet over her, but could not cover her feet, so I pulled it down and her shoulders were uncovered and I pulled it up and her feet were uncovered again. Then she was in a crib a very large crib and she was sitting up, laughing, she was a beautiful child, but I can't remember any details of her face or hair. (105 words)

At one time I worked at a very large wholesale/retail hardware store and one of the men I worked with was named Bud. In the dream I was back working in that store only the whole set up was different and Bud was not a clerk in the store but a customer. He wanted a large bag of some lawn preparation, probably Scott's lime or something and he wanted to know the price so we started looking inside these catalogues and we couldn't find the price and so I told him that I would do some research and check around and try to find the price. The store closed and that was it. I went home I guess. (118 words)

I dreamed about my younger daughter, C. In the dream she was a small child again and I was leaning out an upstairs window of an apartment where we lived apparently, and she was crossing a very busy street and I shouted down to her "C watch what you're doing!" Because she wasn't watching where she was going and the traffic was very heavy and she just said "yeah" and she bent over and picked up a banana peal and once again I shouted "don't pick up other people's garbage!" and she flaunted the banana peal, waved it around.

C and I were going to a beach and we had to walk down quite a steep incline and the path was very narrow, and between very prickly bushes, possibly holly bushes. They grabbed at our clothing and scratched our arms and legs, but it wasn't painful at all. They were very pretty glossy green leaves and red berries and the path was just wide enough for one foot so you had to place one foot directly in front of the other. We finally got down to the beach but there was no beach, there were just big rocks, and she clambered up onto a big rock, and I was just behind her and I looked out and there was a huge wave coming and I screamed "C watch out for the wave!" and she clung to her rock which she was on and which had a point on it, and the water engulfed both of us and through the water I could see her hanging onto the rock and I tried to reach her but I couldn't because the water was so powerful, and when the water subsided, she was gone and I was totally dry and I just shouted at the top of my lungs "Oh God! C come back!". I woke up very, very startled. (218 words)

I was hanging up clothes for my mother and one of the pieces of cloth was one of my dad's tan workshirts. They were long sleeved and he had pants that matched them. The shirt was almost as if it had been very stiffly starched and ironed and I had a real problem hanging it on the line and one of my mothers friends was on the lawn, playing with a dog I don'' remember the size of the dog, but I was surprised that this dignified lady, this school librarian would be roughhousing with a dog and there was a small statue of Queen Victoria on a stand somewhere, and it was very nicely painted, she was not in mourning and that the most common picture you see of her... Here she was short and dumpy but she had on lovely clothes, a blue skirt and pink blouse and that's it. (152 words)

One of the women in the building named M and I were baby sitting this beautiful, little boy 5 or 6 years old, he was just adorable, and for some reason I needed to get some chocolate chips and so M offered to take me to the store in her car which she has done a few times, except that her car was a convertible in my dream and we went for miles and miles and we were so concerned about this little boy that we were supposed to be caring for. And we got the chips and we came back and her car, a bright teal color, as it is in reality, the sky was blue and the sun was shining, and we got back to where the little boy was, and he was just fine and the boy's father was there and he wanted to know where we'd been and why we left the boy un-watched and then went on to another subject and to my relief we didn't have to answer him, and incidentally, this is the third dream I've had lately about baby sitting. The other two just drifted in and out and I had no memory of them. (203 words)

I'm at work, I'm not sure where, but I'm stopping off where a conversation is taking place in. I think the third floor hallway of our wing I think. There were some people, but the only person who was speaking to me at the time was, I think, one of the other counselors named M. And he said, "You know, you don't have to be blind to learn things too" and I said "What did you say?", he repeated it and I said, "I know that." (86 words)

I'm at a client's house, at her kitchen table and a relative of mine, a cousin named J came in and said she was T's wife, so we were talking and she said that she had lost some of her sight, we were talking and she seemed very sad and needing of someone to talk to, but at the same time I was very happy to see her, because I haven't seen her in a long, long time and I like seeing cousins that I haven't seen in a long, long time and we chatted on and I think there was sunlight coming in from the window, near the table where I was sitting because it felt like it was afternoon, about 2 in the afternoon. Then the dream jumps to my old house that I grew up in and J was there too and my parents and my sister and I and my friend N. N was my first roommate when I got my apartment and N had a long antennae from a radio and we're getting stations, faraway stations, but when you walk past you have to make sure you don't walk into the antennae. So she's getting a faraway station and she's wanting me to listen to it, but I wanted to go to bed, but she persuaded me to listen to this funny show, there was a song on the radio and I was listening to it and they had different beat in music to it, so we were laughing about the song. And when I decided that we would go into the living room, J was there and she was going to watch TV with my parents, M and my sister, but I was torn between watching TV with them or because I was tired, going to bed. So I said "goodnight" and they all sat down on different couches and chairs and I saw that they were all settled in and I gave it a little bit of thought and, this is about 9:30 at night, I remember seeing the light was on in the living room and I remember the TV was on, I could hear the TV, I could hear them all taking their positions and after a bit more thought I said that I was going to bed because I was tired and I went back to my old room, where I used to sleep and I saw J's pajamas and I moved them, put them somewhere else, I don't remember where. Then I took my guide dog in my room, and for a minute I couldn't remember if I had taken her out at 9:00. Then I remembered that they were doing some kind of construction work in the back yard and I was wondering if it was okay to go out there and I could hear bulldozers and stuff. Then I remembered that I had taken her out but I also thought that if I hadn't I would have taken her out in the front yard. The back wasn't such a good idea because they were doing some kind of digging. I patted her and felt her soft fur and said goodnight to her and lay down and went to bed. (542 words)

I'm at work in the office of a rehab teacher named D, a transistor radio is on, I held it in my hand and placed it on my desk. They were talking about a thousand dollar contest you could win if you listen use UPS, but they're calling it a 'star program'. D said that she was already entered and was hoping to won the prize. I hadn't entered yet but I thought to myself that I was hoping that it wasn't too late to do that. (87 words)

The next snippet dream is I was in the apartment, I think I had when I was in Springfield and it seems to be that I'm in my living room and I could see the sunlight coming in the window and I was listening to a tape on the tape recorder and my friend G was taping to me and she said that she wants me to copy her tape. I didn't have a duplicator and so it was really funny, I had to take 2 tape recorders, my little one and a larger one and I had them laid out on the floor, on the rug, in the living room of my apartment that I used to have way back in 1983. I was taping the tape and although I thought it was silly, I felt intimidated and thought that I had better do what she tells me and then the dream jumps to work, and suddenly the 2 tape recorders are there and the tapes are being made and I don't want the boss to see it, and he starts to express some kind of disagreement about something one of the counselors was doing and how they had to be away from the offices and how they had to drive away from the buildings and I go in the office and I'm doing my tapes and copying the tapes and I want him to think that its part of work, and then I'm trying to do some other work too. I wasn't sure what else I was doing, using some machine or something, but I had this idea that I had to keep busy and so I was sitting at the desk between the 2 tape recorders and trying to do another task with it so I could keep working.

I was walking out of some hospital because I had to have some kind of short, out patient procedure and there was a door that I was able to walk through, and I felt really good, but then it was like adjacent to my own office building and so I ended up having to be at work, about a 30 second walk from work, like in a different direction was work, in a different building. I walked into the work area and asked if someone could give me a ride because I didn't think that it was all right for me to walk home even though I felt pretty good, I didn't think that it was a good idea and they said, a lady, I think it was one of my drivers, she said "well we don't know if we can do that, we have to get approval first from somebody else". The dream seemed to end there. (158 words)

We are in my parents' car, I am sitting in the back seat, I could feel that it was morning and we had to go to 2 weddings in New York, one on a Wednesday and another one on a Saturday. And I knew that my father didn't want to go and I said, "yeah I know, but at least they're both together and at least if we're going to one we might as well go to the other one as well. When we got there, we had to climb up a lot of flights of stairs because my aunt lived in the building but we had to climb up to the fifth floor, it was the same house that we visited a long, long time ago. I could feel the stairs under my feet, the so I knew we were climbing up the same stairs. I don't know how, but somehow I had also arrived in a cab too inside my parents were not there but I do not remember the weddings, somehow it jumped and we were at my parents' house having a big party and there were people there and they were all eating different things, and my brother in law was there too and we were all talking animatedly and I can remembered eating grinders. My brother in law had to leave in the middle and I could hear him going up the stairs to his house to the second floor and I was entertaining a lot of the people when he left. And then some other person came in, a relative of one of the people at the party, and we were all having a big dinner and talking and enjoying it, we were all happy and I can't remember some of the conversations but we were all talking, and I can't remember what time of day it was, exactly.

I am at Redwood and there's a swimming pool but it looks really strange, there's a part that's really shallow which you have to get into first before you can get into the real part, so I hadn't gotten into the real part yet but had only gotten into the shallow part before I woke up, and I could sense that the shallow part was a different shape, and there were some people sitting around in the shallow part and they told me that I would have to go by them to get to the deep part and the re were like two different sections and you had to climb over this funny section before you could get to the real swimming part. And then we were at the Redwood school where I went when I was really little for that pool part of the dream and then we were in my house and people had come to my house and there were kids and they went into my pocket book and they moved all my stuff around and I was trying to figure out what they had done, and they took my signature guide and they took the top off of it so that I couldn't use it anymore and I wasn't very happy about that and I told them that. I noticed that on the signature guide the top was missing one corner so that it didn't go straight across and it wasn't a rectangle anymore, and I was trying to figure out what they were doing and why they were messing up all of my stuff. In the middle of it, one of my client's case records were on my bed too, all my Braille notes to them, not the print ones and I was looking at them and reading them and going through them and figuring out what was going on with that.

My tape recorder had run out of batteries which was kind of a surprise, I was using my little one, I was holding it in my hand and I was pushing the play button to check it and I could tell by the pitch that the batteries were going, so I went into my bedroom, opened up my top drawer to get the batteries out and when I felt around for the 2 little double-As, next to them was a little tiny cup about an inch high and it had a handle on it and I said "no, that's not a battery". I left the cup in there, and put the new batteries in and was surprised that the old batteries had run out since I hadn't been listening to the recorder that long a time. (136 words)

It's Christmas and I'm talking to someone about what I'm giving people for Christmas, but I can't remember what I'm giving everyone, I can remember some and I name them and the gifts that I'm giving them but I can't remember what I'm giving everyone else. I was giving out some ceramic mugs to my aunt F and others that I can't remember. And then we were at a school and an atheist friend that I have was going to be reading the Christmas story and so we were all supposed to go down to listen to him, they made the announcement over some kind of PA system, that we should go down and listen to him, but I thought that doesn't seem right because he doesn't believe in God and in Christians and I didn't want to go because it would be kind of hypocritical to be there unless he's changed and I thought its kind of weird and so I stayed in another room, I don't know exactly what was in there, there was a wooden floor, there was no carpeting where I was. I had a Braille copy of the Christmas story, just a few pages like they were torn out of a magazine. It looked like computer paper and it was all folded up and I was trying to find how it was arranged so I could find the top. I was riffling through the pages with my hand trying to figure out how it was arranged so that I could find the beginning. Then we were in a car, looking for something to eat, my driver B (male) was driving us and we were hungry and we stopped in this restaurant and there were people waiting on us that were [unclear] and these girls were waiting on us but they weren't happy doing it or they didn't know what they were doing and there was confusion. There were wooden tables that we were sitting at and we never really ate though because the girl that was waiting on us was doing different things and so I don't remember eating even though we were in there. We were sitting in the middle of this restaurant. (368 words)

It is morning and I am walking to work. Somehow I have to go a different way to get there. Instead of crossing where I usually do I get to a different corner where on my right, there's a big, metal container of some kind. Its tall and it makes it hard for me to hear the traffic because its tall and is blocking the sound. But somehow there's a way that I can talk to a police person who is up there working, I'm not sure how, I had a radio or something, And I could hear the police person at work talking about this situation so we talked each other through it and then the police person is there at work, putting in paper work for different things that have to be done. Then we went to another building where the new work shop is going to be and it was kind of set up in different ways, where we had to go through all these doors where everyone is standing around talking, there are a whole lot of people there.

We were at work but it was really more of a class than a work and a whole bunch of us are in class with a teacher and we decided that we're not going to stay. A couple of us anyway, decide that we're going to leave early and just take off so it was about 1:30 in the afternoon, I kept looking at my watch, my Bell watch. And somehow we all ended up going to a party and there was a whole lot of us there, many of the people were also members of the Idaho Counsel of the Blind, which I am a member of and we were eating. We all had these bags of food and I was reaching in and grasping with my fingers, little mandarin orange sections and eating them and they tasted really nice and juicy and there was a candy bar but the candy bar felt different it had like a cut out rectangle on one side and it was flat like a regular candy bar on the other side and the rectangle felt like the whole shape of the whole candy bar, like a border on one side, raised up about a quarter of an inch. And you could feel the recess of the rectangle on one side and I said "oh, I've never had one of these before" and I ate it and it was good. We were all eating and I was eating a lot more than I had wanted to and I remember thinking, 'gee I shouldn't be eating all of this its too much' but I kept on eating anyway. We were celebrating S's birthday, he's the head of a magazine I get on tape, and I got to meet him once at a convention, and he wasn't at the party, which didn't matter, we were still celebrating his birthday anyway. The A was talking to one of the other people at the party and telling her that she really didn't want to do something that this other person wanted her to do, and that was unusual I thought, because A doesn't usually complain. About stuff. And I thought, that's good, because if she really doesn't want to do it then she shouldn't do it just because the person who's asking is blind and she's sighted. (389 words)

There are people present in my house, some that I know and some that I don't. But I decide that I want to take a nap and its about 3:00 in the afternoon. So I go upstairs to my bed and I sleep. When I wake up things are all mixed up. I look at my watch, it says ten minutes to seven, and I think about the people and I think I better get up and go downstairs. I again look at my Braille watch and there's a third hand in it and the third hand makes it read like its 4:00, but then this other hand makes it look like ten to seven and so I'm not sure if its ten of seven or 4:00 and I said, "I don't remember there being a second hand on my watch". I went down stairs and I asked if anybody was going to cook anything and nobody wanted to do anything and my sister was there and she said "well I don't know", but I was hungry and I was wondering if we should call out and get some food delivered, but I was also thinking of cooking, but I couldn't decide what to do so I said "I'm going to bed". So I went to bed and I was trying to sleep and I was trying to wake up and I was so tired. When I touched my dog, there was like a pocket on her, a shallow slide pocket where you would hide something very thin in, it was made of fur, but when I put my hand in it it didn't seem to bother her and I thought this was pretty strange to see this on my dog, it didn't seem like an injury to her and I couldn't figure that out. My pillow was all drooley when I woke up. (314 words)

We were traveling to NY and we were getting off of a plane and instead of being that usual flat thing, we had to go down this funny metal thing and it was like a metal, inclined plane and it was very narrow from left to right, somehow I reached down to touch it and it was like a slide for emergency exits but it wasn't an emergency and when I touched it with my right hand, when I stooped down, to clamber kind of, forward, off of it there were like little grooves in it. I knew there wasn't going to be enough room on it for Betty, my guide dog, so she had to follow behind me, but she did. Then we were getting to our hotel, and my suitcase was really heavy and someone helped me carry it and then I had this broken tooth, one of my molars, I could feel it with my tongue, my tooth was like all coming off of the bottom of my gum, I could pick it up and it was only attached on one end, but it wasn't hurting or anything. Then there was this console in front of us with 4 switches on it. You turn them to the right and you can hear people talking about different things. They were all talking about businesses and you had to decide whether their business was solvable or soluble or worth getting involved in. And I said to one of them, "no that's just not going to work", it was somehow connected with the Idaho Counsel of the Blind. There were people there from other states and they were talking about their businesses and we said, "no that's not going to work". Each switch represented one person's business and we listened to the one on the left and then the next one and then the next and somehow my father was there and we were eating and the rest is too vague.

There are two clients I am working with, a lady whose name starts with a J and a man whose name starts with a Q. J is about 16 and in high school and Q is 17 because he's almost graduating and its almost the 30th of September . A place called me and they wanted me to fill out a form for Q, one that I'd never heard of before, so I was trying to find a copy so that I could figure out what they wanted on it I had to decide whether J should attend [famous blind school] or public school next year. It was up to me and my supervisor said if there was only one service that the person needed then J could stay in her home, but I was trying to figure out stuff like whether she could see the blackboard and so I said that I would have to talk to her and find out what she wants to do. So I was working in my dream and I said "oh, well, I better get this form done for Q by September 30th because they have to have it by the end of the fiscal year". Then I looked in vain, and said to person who was with me and said that we weren't supposed to be this far, that we had to go back to New Hampshire, we don't have the proper travel authorization to be up here, if we're caught we will be in trouble. At first we were laughing about it and then we decided that we better go back to where we're supposed to be. That was evening when we were in Maine and we had to get back to New Hampshire.

We are riding in a car one of the rehab teachers is in the front seat and I am in the back seat we got into conversation and she told me that she spends her summers in West Hampton and I told her that I spent years of summers in West Hampton. We got to talking and we were going to where she stays. I told her where I was and she said that she was 2 to 3, miles away from there and I was really excited to get back to West Hampton again, I hadn't been there in a long time. We got there but then we ended up going to a church, and one of these lady's that I know, A was at the church and was preying. I took a rosary out, or had it in my fingers and was praying, but then mass was going to start and so I couldn't finish saying it. When I came out of the church, I had to try and find the driver of the car that had brought us and I didn't know if she had seen me, and I had to walk around the parking lot for a while before she saw me and she called out to me. I then got into her car. Then I was in my apartment in Eastfield somehow, and there were people there, this lady named N who used to room with me when I was in my very first apartment in the 70s in Massachusetts, and I had to get up and make breakfast for her yet somehow there were stairs in the apartment and I had to go down the stairs and I didn't want to wake her up and I was going to try and make breakfast for myself first. There was a door at the bottom of the stairs which I had to try and close, so she wouldn't hear me. But then I found out that she was down there already so I couldn't surprise her with making breakfast. (343 words)

A student came in who had a problem with drugs and I handed him his folder, it was the same kind of folder that we use for our vocational rehab cases and I remember picking it up with my right hand and I opened it and the client looked at it and somehow there were dog biscuits in it, I don't understand that, or maybe there were like edible biscuits for people, mixed up with the case so I really didn't understand it and the principal of the school where we were said that the student, the client could just read his folder and put it back and he would be all better, so I said okay and we let the student be his own counselor and somehow he looked at his folder and said "okay, I'll be all right now".

This dream involved guide dog school. Somehow I was at my parents' old house and we were sitting on the front porch and a lady came up and asked how did I get home every day, at what time did I get off the bus, then I said that I don't take the bus, once in a while I take the bus, but most of the time I don't take the bus, at first I couldn't remember how I got home and then I remembered that I took a taxi home, but somehow I couldn't figure out how I did that because somehow I was stuck at Redwood school, where I attended when I was a kid and it didn't seem to have anything to do with working. I knew that I usually walked to work like I do now and so I was all mixed up trying to answer her question, it seemed like an unusually difficult question, very confused. Then I was at guide dog school and there were all these people who it seemed were waiting to be evaluated for guide dogs. There must have bee 45 students all standing around asking questions and nobody was assisting them, and I wasn't there to get a guide dog, but I remember thinking, gee, what a disorganized school, to have these people standing around asking questions and not being seated in a room, being talked to about what to expect and what its going to be like. And then we were in this other place and it was really early in the morning and we had eaten breakfast and I was walking around and there was a lot of grass and a lot of opened space, and for some unknown reason, I had to get up early and I said that I was going to walk around down here, its so nice, it was a countryish setting and I was going to walk around.

I am in a college dorm room, I think it was my old room at [City] College and B was rooming with me and we had pizza in our room and I said "there's no anchovies on this pizza" and we wanted anchovies on it. And I was in bed and she had an anchovy all wrapped up in paper and she handed it to me and I unwrapped it and I was surprised that she had brought one and I said "well how did you know that we were going to have pizza in the first place?". I don't know what she said and we were laughing about it and I asked her if she wanted the anchovy and she said "no" I could have it. So I ate it. At some point I opened my suitcase and got my transistor radio out and turned it on, I was trying to find a religious show but I found Dr. Dean Edell and I was listening to him. There was a whistle in the radio, it wasn't coming in so good, and I remember that my suitcase was really light. In reality my suitcases are very heavy usually. It was the larger kind, not the little tiny ones that you usually get on pizza, so I tasted the anchovy then there was a man there, who I think was a psychologist, but he seemed very old, like around 85 and his wife was there, and somehow his suitcase or briefcase was locked and he couldn't get it open and he had important things in there that he had to get, that he had papers that showed him how to open it, a combination perhaps, but he couldn't remember where he had put them and so he couldn't get it open and I was trying to help and I said "try not to think about it and maybe you'll remember, if you try not to think about it, sometimes you'll remember things about where you put things". That was the end except that his wife was really upset that he couldn't get the suitcase or briefcase opened. I didn't know what it was because I didn't touch it. That was in the same dorm, he was in a different room of the same dorm. (382 words)

I was on the telephone with a person named T who is a supermarket guy who takes the orders for me when I call up to put my order in for the week, because they deliver and he was playing an organ and he wanted me to play mine so he could hear mine and I said "wait a minute" and I went over to the organ that I have at home and I was doing the different stops that it has with my left hand, and I couldn't get it to sound the way I had hoped it would , I was going for a particular vibrato and it wasn't going to that sound and I was getting frustrated because I couldn't get it to go to that certain sound quality that I was going for.

I was over at our [blind] industries department and they were making these beautiful sweaters and I touched this beautiful, woolen, knit sweater, which was very well done and I asked what color it was and somebody said that it was yellow and our clients could make them and I said, "let me bring down the products, I have a lady in the hospital now, it might give her some ideas and might make her feel better even though she's sick, to know that she can do this project" and they said "okay" so after calling her I went down and showed her this project, she wasn't mad or anything and she didn't sound sick, not very sick. So I asked my lady driver if she would bring me down, it was about 1:30 in the afternoon to Naugatuck where the client was and she did, but when we got there we didn't go to the client's room, we went to this other place. There were all these children, handicapped, in wheelchairs and we had all these little animals and they said put the animals up on the wheelchairs, but not where the food is, put them up by the kids' heads, more like on the back of the wheelchair. They were little fake animals about an inch long and they sort of stayed on the backs of the wheel chairs and we were having a party with them and eating with them, in this big, well-lit room and I think it was afternoon.

I was in church, at mass and suddenly the father stopped the mass and said "that's all I'm going to do, I'm not going to do anymore mass, I'm leaving" and he did and we all got really mad, all of us in the church and we started to say "he can't do this! We have to have mass. What would happen if all the priests did that? We'd have no more mass! It would be awful." My friend B and her mother and I were walking out and I said "you know, that's terrible, I think he just did that because he's got somewhere to go on his schedule and he just wanted to get out and do it" and B's mother said; "he's right there. He just heard everything you said" and I said "I don't care! I'm glad he heard me and I'd say it again if he wanted me to because its not fair that he did that to us." And I was real mad and didn't know what to do. We kept walking and went home and I was at the church that was across the street from the house where my parents lived when I was growing up, so we went to their house. (210 words)

Its night time and I'm in NY at somebody's apartment, I was lying in bed, I had Betty next to me lying on the floor and we were watching television, listening to it anyway, it was about midnight, but then it was my aunt M and she said "lets go see H" who's my cousin, "its close enough to walk, we don't have to get in the car" but my sister didn't want me to bring Betty, and there were some kids staying there and they were sleeping and I said "no I'm bringing Betty because she'll bark whenever she's away from me and she'll keep the neighbors awake" and so I took Betty with us and the only thing we had to do to get to this cousin of mine was to go out a door, turn right, go down this other driveway thing and then there was another turn and we ended up at his house and I go "well that's not far". So then we stayed there for a while and went right back home again, back to the other lady's house and we just talked. I don't remember much about the conversation. It was nice to see them, they were happy to be together. (208 words)

I'm in this thing called the Runway at Redwood, its between the dining room door and another door to the main part of the building where the classrooms were. And there are lockers and they're made out of wood and another door which leads outside. In the middle of the runway were these great big, structures made of a like Tinker Toy material almost four feet high. You could take your hand and grasp these pegs, these things and take them apart. And they said, "and you guys gotta help out because we only have 10 minutes to get this runway clear because there's going to be a lot of people coming through here, we've got to get these things taken apart." I pulled on one and it came apart pretty easily. So first I was at one end of these things trying to help out, and there were a lot of others helping too, some ladies that are head consultants that work with us. And to my surprise, I pulled on the Tinker Toy-like peg and it came out of the 2 ends it was connected on, and it came off the structure pretty easily, but I didn't have anything to put them in, so I had about 4 or 5 of them in my hands and I was trying to figure out where to put them. I started out at one end, couldn't figure out where to put them and then I went to the other end, see how long it is, how much progress people are making with this thing. It was pretty good, it was going pretty fast but the project never really ended because I woke up. (282 words)

A lady that I work with gave me a ride home. When we left work there was a very light, fluffy snow falling. I could feel it as I walked on it. It was about 4:15, the time we get out of work and she said "oh, I'll give you a ride home" and so I said "Okay", and when we got home, it was a Monday. My niece was there when I got home and she said "oh I didn't go to work today, but I'll go tomorrow" and I was thinking it wasn't fair that she got the day off and I didn't. Then I went to do laundry and somehow somebody had been using the washing machine, but they had it on hold. And I had to figure it out. I don't know how they had set it up, it was kind of mixed up, but we went over there and fixed it up. (157 words)

We're in some kind of room in the West Haven industries division of BESB talking about the cigarette assembly project and how they had to make 3 cigarettes per minute and they were showing us all these cigarettes and how they go together and stuff. It was all smoky, I could smell the smoke, I hate smoke and I was really conflicted because I didn't think it was ethical to put people in this kind of job because it meant that they would have to be around this kind of smoke. But this lady was doing her job and she liked it, and she was able to meet that production rate that they wanted. (114 words)

I am at work, walking around the halls without my dog, I don't have a dog and it doesn't seem to bother me, and I am walking around without a cane. I'm walking around without getting hurt or bumping into anything. My boss is there and he's saying that we have to treat a certain person well at work because he is going in for an operation and they don't know what's going to happen to him. I'm thinking, "yeah, he ought to be telling people to be nice to everybody all the time anyway and not just when they're having medical problems." I was wondering if I was going to run into him before he went to the hospital and people had said that he was at work and I said "he's too sick to be here. He shouldn't be here." Its later and somehow I'm upstairs of my house and a whole bunch of strange, bad people come in but they're barking like dogs, they're making these noises like barking dogs make and that sound like Bob Steele used to play with, the barking dogs which were supposed to represent some kind of hunt. My mother was there and she said that I had to get rid of this cough drop because the bad people put something bad on it that would hurt me. Then I remember my mother how my mother had cancer in real life and how she wouldn't and couldn't get better, even if she got rid of the cough drop, it wouldn't matter. (259 words)

We were in the kitchen of my parents' house it was about 2PM and I was sitting at the table and a CRIS volunteer was there and she was printing out in Braille. She had always wanted to help but she was concerned and asked if it was coming out readable and I said "yes." I was reading it with my fingers and it was okay, there were some reversals but I could still figure it out so I didn't tell her that I couldn't figure it out, she had reversed a lot of Es and Is but I didn't say anything. She said "can you read the second line?" and I said "yes I could." (116 words)

We were taking a tour of a huge school where many of the people there had problems with alcohol, drugs and other problems. People lived there too. This female high school kid was giving me a tour. She was on my right. I don't think I had my dog. I was going inside with her and so I had my right hand on her left arm. We were walking around the school and she was explaining things, we had to stop every now and again and listen to this boring speaker explain things. Then she said "Oh, remind me that I have to go to my room before we leave" so I said "okay" and I did and she went and did what she had to. She thanked me for reminding her. It was a very large building, and walking around was tiring because it was so spacious. (148 words)

I was staying in a suburb of Chicago with people who had some children we were there for about a week and we had to do a lot of riding, because it seemed that whenever they went anywhere, shopping, we would have to drive these very long distances and I remember thinking "gosh, I'd hate to have to do all this driving. I'm glad I don't have to drive this far all the time. The children were writing a poem and each one put in a stanza and the first child's poem was like ordinary and concrete and trite and I thought "well this wont develop into anything" and then the second child's stanza was kind of the same and yet they kept adding to it and finally everybody kept adding verses and as they did it became more and more the way real literature would be and it got really meaningful; and I thought "wow! When it first started out I hadn't expected it to become such a beautiful poem, I want to put it in Braille" and they said "okay we'll write it down." (186 words)

It was afternoon and we were at work ands I was in an office talking to a couple of teachers. One rehab teacher who doesn't always see things the way I do, someone who is not as understanding as I wish she could be sometimes with our clients. I am always frustrated with her because of this. I was frustrated in the dream as well. They were in their office, all talking and not really working very hard and others were there too. Her assistant came in and said "I'm going to watch TV." She had a TV on near her desk. I was standing in the doorway, about 2PM and she went over to her desk on the opposite side of the wall. The teacher I was trying to talk to was nearer to me. I thought it would probably be a good idea for me to leave the room because I didn't want to get caught watching TV or even being a room with a TV even though I wasn't going to be listening to it or watching it so I didn't stay very long.

I'm wearing a very pretty silk dress and I have my period, but I have protection so I am not worried about doing anything to the dress. But I always get concerned about when I have dreamt like this, because in my dream I know that I don't get it anymore because I had a hysterectomy in real life. So I always have a conflict feeling in my dream when I have it in my dream. Later I am reading a book of Braille pages, 19 to 34. It was about this girl who happened to be one of my old clients and that she was riding horses and she was doing all these sporty things, like playing football and she was totally blind and I couldn't figure out how she could do all that. Then I thought, well the article is wrong or something's strange about this magazine. In the same dream I am at this house with a great big living room, but somehow its my house and its after 4PM and you walk out of this carpetted area to a screened in porch and its really nice. The carpeting is new but there are these big square pieces of lint which are somehow there because it is new and I had to get rid of them because I was scared that my dog would try to eat them but I didn't think the vacuum cleaner was picking them up, because I had bent down and felt a couple and touched them.

We were in a house, I don't know whose it was, my sister was getting some ice-cream together and strawberries, but instead of putting them together we had them separately. There were strawberries in a dish and instead of using a spoon, I had picked up the dish and was drinking the strawberries out of the dish and I was going to get to the ice cream later after the strawberries. I could feel the little bowls that they were in and just before I began to eat the strawberries, I put an object, it was a soft, stuffed animal type thing but it was a person, made of this canvasy type material representing Saint Paul. So somehow I had to put this thing, like a stuffed animal, next to me and someone said "that's Saint John" and I said "No that's Saint Paul" . It had a great big base so I knew it wasn't going to fall over or get into my ice cream or strawberries. (168 words)

I remember getting on a bus and this lady named Jan was our bus driver and I thought we were going a short distance and although we got on in Hartford, we ended up going to New Haven. It was just a local bus not a Greyhound type of bus. I really didn't want to go that far but I had no choice because it happened. I was really distraught because I had in my pocket 2 checks for 2 bills I was going to pay and I noticed after getting on the bus that instead of putting in checks for the bills, I had put in 2 canceled checks instead. I couldn't fix it, and part of me asked if I should take out the canceled checks and chance putting cash in there instead, because I had no way of writing out new checks. I decided to go home later and fix them up even though I was supposed to mail them today. Then we got to [a state university] and there was a lady there, an administrator of [another town] who said "oh, you can't run things by yourself you always have to have your assistant with you" and I said "no, I've run seminars on my own without an assistant and the kids that were there really liked them" so I was trying to convince her that I could do all that stuff. And then we had the radio on and it was WPOP and instead of being sports there was a children's format all the time, they played children's programming. There was another lady there named Jan that I knew and she wanted to be reimbursed for things that she had bought, clothes that she had bought and I said "no we couldn't do that" I was pretty sure the system wouldn't let me do that, because she ended up being a client and she wanted to be reimbursed for stuff.

We were about to sit down to dinner and it was about 50 degrees out about 5pm and I said I can't now, I have to take Betty out. So I took Betty out and then came back and ate.

I couldn't get her to go and I was really frustrated. I tried repeatedly to get her to go and she wouldn't go and then somebody said there's a dog on the other side of the curb, the up-curb on the left hand side eating kibble and Betty wants to get the dog's space so she can eat and I said "oh that ,makes sense then". Then we were in some kind of a store and this lady said she was going to buy some kind of shampoo for her dog, but it was a grocery store and I didn't think they had dog shampoo. I said "if you can buy dog shampoo here for your dog, maybe I can buy some for Betty too" And then we bought cards but we had to take them home first and write some stuff in it, we couldn't just give them away as they were, so somebody helped me do mine.

We were at the house I grew up in and I had raised a big party. My 3 cousins who are brothers were there and we had cookies and shrimp salad and al kinds of stuff, but everything was together in the same area on one big counter and I was reaching and getting cookies to eat and talking in a very animated manner with my cousins about how wonderful my brother in law was and good he was to me, how he thinks of me and asks me if I need anything and I was saying "do you have brother in laws like that?" but of course they didn't answer, "as nice as mine are."

I was at Monticello in Charlottesville, Virginia visiting Thomas Jefferson's house which I had already seen. I was down in the basement looking at all the clocks, a big clock that he had made. It has cannon balls on it. I guess my husband was with me. He and I were visiting and getting our own, personal tour of Monticello. We went there in 1989 with a bunch of people, but in this dream we were getting our own private tour.

I don't know why, and I don't know why we were going to this party when we were going to have our own party the next day.

They told him that he could invite some other people to fly out to Minneapolis and be on the show with him, so he chose Mort and I. Maybe because we've been friends for so long.

I had made an appointment with my hairdresser to get a permanent. I went there and the hairdresser said that there were some changes. I sat down in the chair and she pushed a button somewhere and these scissors came out of the wall I think, and began to cut my hair. They were automatic. They would cut for so long and then they would stop. I could hear this noise, this motor, I guess they were going back into the wall or wherever they came from. She said "that's fine, this won't hurt you, sit down in this chair." I did and all these rollers came out and went where they should go automatically. Then she said I would have to go under the dryer and I said there wasn't one. She said "Oh no, you have to stand up under the dryer." I did and the dryer was there and she pushed a button and the dryer came on and dried my hair off. Of course she had shampooed it first and put all that gunk in it. She had this little machine which was on for 20 minutes or so, this dryer thing. Then she said "I've got to put on the neutralizer, the stuff you have to put on your hair to make the permanent perm. Then she said come over to this part of the room and I went and she brought me over to another machine and she said "put your head back." There was no sink there or anything like there usually is. Then this lotion came out from this place in the wall I guess. When it was over, she said that she wanted to give me a blow cut so I had to go back to the dryer again. In real life my hairdresser does all these things herself but in the dream it was all done automatically. I don't know if she had robots or what. I remember her telling me that the equipment had just come and she wanted to try it out and so I guess I was playing her guinea pig. (354 words)

We were in Stop and Shop, shopping, but they were having this contest in which they gave you this amount of time where someone would come around and tap you on the shoulder and say things: "Soups" then we'd have to go where the canned soups were. Then we'd have to collect as many cans of soup as we could within 5 minutes or something. Then they'd come around and tap you again and say "bread" then we'd have to go to the bread aisle and collect as much as you could within 5 minutes. Or they'd say "frozen foods" and we'd go off through the store like that. But the thing was, they had carriages everywhere so you could do this thing. My mother-in-law was in this dream, somehow, impossible because she passed away in 1994. My father-in-law's current wife, Rebecca was in the dream.

I could feel the sun falling on my face and it felt warm and good. I listened to the tape on a tape recorder and it said that it was time for me to get another guide dog.

I was at my grandmother's house and I was feeling happy because I was in her kitchen. It was cold outside, the snow was falling. I guess I had gone outside just before I went into the kitchen because I remember the snowflakes kind of falling on my eyelashes and falling on my hair, my hair was wet. I went into her kitchen and she was baking my favorite kind of cookie which was chocolate chip and asking me if I wanted to help her bake cookies and I always enjoyed doing that because it meant that we would be sharing them with other people. So I was sitting there baking cookies with my grandma in her kitchen and just feeling really good about this until I awoke and realized that I had to get up and go back to work. (141 words)

I was sitting at work and I reached down to see if Sammy was okay and I couldn't find her. I looked on the floor under my desk, I looked to the side, reaching around to see if I could touch her, I couldn't find her and I started to call her, "Sammy! Sammy! Where are you I can't find you!" And she didn't come back. My heart started beating real fast. I couldn't find her and the person who was supposed to be helping me with my driving, said "Sammy's around, don't worry about her." But I couldn't find her anywhere and so I started to go up and down the halls, thought it might be smart to take my white cane with me in case I happen to come across any obstacles. I was walking up and down the hall and no one had seen her. Then somebody told me that someone had scared her and she had run down the stairs and the front door was open and she had run out, so I ran down 3 flights of stairs from my office and out the front door and I was calling her and I couldn't find her and I was screaming for people to help me look for her and nobody was helping and everybody told me that she'd come back and the day went by and I was panicked and Sammy wasn't there and I finally woke up and I couldn't find Sammy and I started to scream for her and I guess I woke her up too and she touched me as if to indicate "why had I done that?"

I was at a rehabilitation center for the blind. I had been sent there by my agency to find out if they were wasting the money we spent there for clients we sent there. For instance were they saying that our clients needed more services and not delivering them but only using the money for their own gain? So I was kind of like an investigative reporter. When I was told I had to go I felt kind of strange because I hadn't done that kind of work before and I told my supervisor I don't want to do this, I'm not the qualified person to do this job. He said "you're exactly what we need because nobody will suspect you. In fact we're going to send you as we would a client except you're going to be taking all these notes and asking all these questions and they won't suspect you. Well, I thought about it and I said to him; "All of this will be a challenge, where am I going?" And he said not to the nearby rehab center in Pennsylvania, I was kind of hoping for that one because that's where the Philadelphia Flyers were. He said I know you like hockey, but we're not sending you there and we're not sending you anywhere on the East coast. We're sending you out to Little Rock Arkansas. And I said "Little Rock, Arkansas! The center out there? Its hot and humid here in the summer and you're going to send me out there? " He said, that's what we've decided to do, Mr. Flip, the head of the agency has selected you to go and they gave me the airplane tickets. I recall calling the cab and taking a ride to Dunkirk Airport, which is always a hectic airport to go into and I talked to Sammy, I was saying to her, "now Sammy, I know you don't like to fly, it always makes you a little nervous when we take off and land, once we get up there I know you're okay, but you always get a ,little nervous so you relax." And I petted her and I reached into my purse and gave her a Milkbone dog biscuit and we flew to Little Rock and they announced the plane was landing and I woke up. (390 words)

I was in a great big store. But it wasn't a department store it was filled with music boxes. Small ones that played little tunes, and the ones I've always wanted to listen to and maybe buy, the big antique music boxes that had these disks that you could play and have several different tunes on them. I was just listening to those music boxes letting the music kind of surround me and hear the different sounds, the bell-like sounds, the different kinds of music box sounds you can hear... and not only did this shop have music boxes, but it also had all kinds of great things that had music inside them. They had musical clocks, it had a music clock that had a talking announcement before the time of alarm in the morning. It talked so that I could set the alarm myself. They had a radio which gave you the choice of regular music and music box music. There were just all kinds of music boxes there. I reached into my purse because I decided that I wanted to buy some of the music boxes and nothing was inside there, no money and no credit cards to pay for them. I woke up feeling kind of ridiculous. (210 words)

I was standing in my bedroom which has a bureau a bed and a smaller dresser and a couple of tables that I have a tape recorder on and which I listen to when I am listening to tapes. It has a little tiny drawer inside and I have another table with a telephone on it and a few things like that. I was sitting on a chair on one side of my bed and I heard this voice and this person, this voice said to me "How would you like to be able to fly whenever you wanted to?" I said "That sounds kind of interesting, different, but first of all who are you?" And the voice said "My name is Flora." And I said "How am I supposed to fly if I can't tell where I'm going?" And she said "Well, you can just say where you want to go and you'll get there." And that sounded kind of neat, that would save all my transportation problems and I could choose whenever I wanted to do this. So I asked what I needed to do. She handed me this can that smelled like it had had baby powder in it. She said "Just sprinkle some of it on your arms." So I did and she told me, "Just flap them." I did and the next thing I knew was that I had flown out of my room and down the stairs and I was in my livingroom. So I thought this was kind of fun, and I realized that I was getting pretty low on groceries I think I'd like to go grocery shopping so as I was about to go I asked "How am I supposed to take my guide dog with me?" She said "Put a little of that powder on your guide dog too and hold onto the harness, flap an arm and hold onto the leash and the dog will come up with you." So I decided okay, sounds good to me, we started out. We stepped outside, closed the door, locked it stepped down and didn't say "forward Sammy." I said "We're going to do something different and I took her leash and flapped my arms, we went up in the air and I was thinking, I want to go to Shop and Save, they've got good buys there, so off we went. The next thing I knew, I was in the grocery store, but I forgot to ask how I was supposed to manage after I got the groceries. (427 words)

I heard my niece Sandra calling me, she was saying my first name, "help me, I need a place to stay." I said to her "Sandra, where are you, we need to talk." And she said "Yeah, I know, but I'm far away and can't get to you." I said "Where are you" and she said "I've been out in Colorado, but I haven't been following my program the way I promised you and grandma and my mom and dad, I've stopped taking those drugs and I didn't take money from you guys and I'm sorry" and I said, "I'm sorry too, I want to help, but you need more help than I can give you. You need to go to a treatment place and I'll help you get there" and she said "Okay but I can't do it by myself" and I said "I know you can't and that's why we're here and that's why we've always been here when you've gone through the different programs." She said "I know, but I've really messed myself up, I thought I could handle it and I didn't and now nothings going right and I've got to get help. Help me." I ran down the stairs in my [indecipherable] and I checked the front door and yelled her name and I ran to the back door and called her again and I thought, "She's right, she's far far away and I can't find her. I'd have her come here if I could and I'd take care of her but I can't find her or I'd get her the help." The I heard laughter, almost wicked laughter and I thought people were laughing at me for feeling the way that I was and then I heard sad music, like funeral hymns and tears were coming out of my eyes.

I was at Girls Scout camp in a row boat, on the lake. I could feel the boat rocking on the lake, I had the oars in my hands, they were made of wood, I could feel the wood against my fingers and I was making the rowing motion with my hand. I could hear the oars going through the water as they made a splashing sound. There was another person in the boat with me telling me which way to go and she said "turn right," but she meant left and we crashed into another boat. (97 words)

I was in college again. It was summer and instead of enjoying the beach, or sitting outside reading or going for a walk, I was stuck in a hot un-airconditioned classroom. We were reading Shakespeare and my books on tape hadn't come. I had a small tape recorder with a built in mic in my hand and the tape was moving, I could hear the motor and feel it moving. We were all yawning because it was so hot and the professor never came and so we left. I walked out of the classroom, into a hall and outside into the warm sunlight. (103 words)

I was walking in the woods. It was springtime birds were singing, the sun was out, I could feel it on my face. I could smell the pine trees and the different scents of the different trees. I could also smell some of the wild flowers that have that sweet. Real sweet kind of perfume smell. And I was just walking by myself, no one else was around, I was walking, my guide dog was with me, and we were just going through the woods. We passed a little brook and I listened to the rippling sound of the water and decided to sit down because there was a tree there and it was shady and I decided to take a rest. I fell asleep near the tree and then I woke up and continued on my way in the dream, and kept walking through the woods. I decided to go home, I looked at my Braille watch which was on my wrist and discovered it was afternoon, so I walked back home to my condo. (176 words)

I dreamed I was at work and actually I was seeing a client in his house. The client became very violent and took me hostage. They separated me from Sammy and I said to them, "Please, I can do without food and things like that but please don't take me away from Sammy. Sammy means a lot to me and I wouldn't do that to you." They laughed and told me that I didn't need Sammy and they needed her more than I did. I told them that Sammy was trained to work just for me as are all guide dogs. And they said that she'd work for us or they'd kill her. The person decide to try and work with Sammy and when she didn't go with them, they said they killed her. I heard a gunshot and so I knew they did and I started weeping. I could not believe that somebody would do that. (157 words)

I was visiting my sister in Stamford. She has a nice little house, not far from the beach. I walked down to the beach with Sammy and my sister and my 3 little nephews. I could smell the salt air and I could hear the ocean's waves. I could hear the seagulls as they made that mournful cry, while they're either looking for pray or whatever seagulls do. I felt the warmth of the sun on my face, on my shoulders. It felt warm, I kicked off my shoes and picked them up so that I would have them layer and began walking barefoot through the sand. I felt the warm sand between my toes and I felt happy, until I heard a firecracker. The firecracker was awfully close to me and it was very loud, my ears were ringing, I was afraid Sammy had gotten hurt. Luckily the firecracker had missed me this time, but I jumped or jerked a little bit and woke up. (166 words)

I was sitting in my condominium and I heard my computer start talking to me. I was curious as to how this was happening since I hadn't turned it on or connected my speech synthesizer so the computer could talk to me or tell me what was on the screen. Actually there was nothing on the screen but the computer was speaking anyway. It asked me what I wanted and I said I would want to go anywhere that I needed to get to without having to ask other people. So it said, "Okay, lets make a program so you can put down all of the places you usually have to get to." And I started to argue with it and asked it all kinds of questions like "how can all this be happening? I can't drive so what difference does it make if I make out a program?" The computer told me not to be so doubtful. Just pick out the places on the program I wanted included. So I did and it was explained to me that I would tell my computer where I wanted to go and I would get there. I was pretty skeptical because a lot of these pie in the sky things don't work. So I said "Okay, I want to go shopping at the little plaza where the Ames used to be, because there are a bunch of neat stores. Its also more fun to go with somebody and so I want to take Hilda (a blind friend) with me." So I called her in my room, I grasped the telephone, and made a quick call and said "lets go shopping, my computer just talked to me and I programmed it in to know that I wanted to go different places." So we did this. I told the computer I wanted to go shopping top that little plaza, walked into the plaza, went into some of the different stores, the Radio Shack, the Card shop where you can buy all kinds of cards and little gifts, then we went to the bakery where we smelled the aroma of coffee cakes and cookies and all kinds of rich, fattening pastries. Then we went to the shoe store which isn't really there anymore but we went there anyway, and I bought some more shoes. Then there was a department store there and I found some more music boxes, so I bought some of those too. And we found a clothing store and Hilda wanted to buy some clothes, some new dresses and things so I decided to check out those too. And everybody was helpful. Then after we'd had enough shopping, I decided it was time to go home. I had my little palm top computer and I told it through a series of commands to tell my other computer that we needed to get home. A car came and we got home. (488 words)

I was at my nephew John's birthday party. There were a bunch of little kids around, laughing, screaming, yelling and he was opening up his gifts. They opened up the gifts before the birthday cake because, he just was too anxious not to open the gifts first. Then we sang happy birthday and we had some birthday cake. We were out on the lawn of my brother and sister in law's house. Its a small yard but there was soft, green grass and there was enough room for all of us to sit down on the grass and eat the birthday cake. It was my favorite kind. It was chocolate cake with lots of rich, chocolate icing. My nephew got a present which he didn't like, it was a piece of jewelry and it was a heart pendant on a chain and he gave it to me and he said "Gee, why don't you take that you like to wear those." So I took it and tried it on and it was gold, it was very smooth, the chain was also very smooth with one of those little clasps on it, they call a lobster claw clasp that you open with your finger nail and slide the other clasp into it. I told him I would wear that all the time. (221 words)

We had a violent thunderstorm. Sammy has hated them ever since I got hurt by a firecracker. Any kind of loud clapping noise or banging noise like that. That low type sound bothers her. I was telling her to be a good girl and to stay on her rug, then we heard a really loud clap of thunder, the kind that sounds like it hit another object and it sounds like something might catch fire, its really loud and shakes everything and echoes through the air. Well, Sammy disobeyed me and leaped onto my bed, so I had about 70 pounds of dog on top of my stomach. I told her to get off my stomach, to get down, then she started to dig her little claws and paws into me to hold onto me. They were really sharp and it actually hurt a little bit. She wouldn't get down. I jerked awake to discover that it had been thundering and there was Sammy on top of my stomach and she wouldn't get down. (174 words)

I heard all this water going all over the floor, both upstairs and downstairs and all kinds of stuff coming out which smelled kind of gross.

I was in my condo, asleep, in bed, and I heard some strange sounds coming from downstairs. I had locked both the front and back doors, the windows were also closed because I had the air conditioner on and I couldn't figure out how anybody could be in there. But then I smelled meat frying in the kitchen and I heard people walking around and so I thought I'd better investigate. I put my slippers on, rubbed my eyes, threw on a robe and headed down the stairs very carefully, cause I felt like I was only half awake. I heard people talking in the kitchen and I said "Who are you." And a woman said, "Well, we were here and my son and I were hungry and we wanted to have some meat, so I'm frying it in a pan with some eggs." And I said "I don't mind giving people some food, but I'd like to know how you got into my condominium." And she said, well, we just touched the door and it was locked but we wiggled it a little more and it opened so we walked in." So I asked her where she lived and she said "Yeah, they had a house but it was too early to go grocery shopping and they just needed some food." So I made some coffee in my drip coffee maker, cause I said to her, "Well, as long as you're eating breakfast you might as well have some coffee too." And I had some orange juice, so I gave her son and her some of that and then I washed the dishes. Then I said to her, "Gee, you can't just go without having some other kind of food so I opened the lower kitchen cabinets where I keep all of my canned goods and I went through to find some goods that she could utilize and I also took out some macaroni from the upper cabinet, where I keep extra boxes of macaroni on hand, and I gave her some of that. I gave her a can of baked beans so she could mix that with the macaroni because the beans have tomato sauce on them and they can make a little supper. I gave her crackers and peanut butter because I knew that wouldn't spoil, I gave her some tuna fish, then I gave her some bread from the refrigerator so that she and her son could make sandwiches and some soda in cans. They thanked me and went out the door. This was so strange that when I woke up I actually went downstairs in my robe to check whether or not I had left the stove on. (453 words)

I was back at Guiding Dogs again although Sammy was still alive, she just couldn't guide anymore. I don't know if she couldn't or wouldn't because she was just tired of it and so I was getting a new dog. They gave me this huge dog, I think the person said it was a "Masty" dog, but I believe the correct word is a Mastiff. It was a huge dog and I was disappointed because I didn't want a huge dog, they're hard when you take them on buses and things. I told the instructor. "I really don't want that kind of dog." And they said "Okay, we'll give you another one." And they happened to have another like Sammy, another Chocolate Lab. I remember training with the dog and then coming home and then I introduced Sammy to the dog and they were friends and I woke up. (149 words)

There was no body, no head, face height, his voice is the male voice of Harry and the hammer is the typical sound of the hammer, but the hand part holding the hammer is just spirit.

She said "This isn't liquid medicine, this is nitroglycerin for your heart." I said "I don't have any trouble with my heart." But I took them from the cashier and somehow I wound up at a place with round picnic tables and there were a bunch of people there, males and females that I didn't know. I asked someone about this stuff, this liquid like a Maalox or something that I should be taking for my stomach. They said "Oh, those are heart pills, do you have trouble with your heart?" and I said, "No." and I ended up putting the bottle of pills in the shower. It was still sealed.

I was with two people whom I could not identify. It was mainly conversation with two people but I don't know what we were talking about. It was a couple. I was in this place, nothing necessarily familiar although I had a job and this couple was telling me what I had to do. I had to go up to the top floor, and in reality I am petrified of elevators and so I told them that I would take the stairs and they said, "You don't want to take the stairs because they're in worse shape than the elevators." But I decided I would take the stairs and It was some sort of four day work thing. As I climbed the stairs, they started off fine, but as I climbed higher, the stairs became more and more rickety and shaky and wobbly and I was thinking "Oh my God, what are they going to be like when I get to the real top?" And then somewhere in all of this I realized that I had to be in Washington DC in two days although the job was supposed to be four days. The couple sort of leaves. My friend who usually drives me to Washington DC came into my dream. I thought "How do I get down? I'm in the middle of these rickety stairs and I either have to go up and complete the job and miss Washington or I start on down and although I don't remember climbing down the stairs, I must have because I remember asking my driver if he would take me to Washington.

I am walking over some difficult terrain, up a hill, over rocks etc. There are always 2 ways to deal. Jesus is there pulling me, assisting me with the difficult way and the devil is there too, guiding me toward a much easier, pleasanter route; fields of flowers and cool breezes, paved paths and so forth. The odd thing is, both Jesus and the devil look alike in the dream. Their faces are both smooth, unlined, clean shaven, like a baby's cheeks. They sometimes are pulling in opposite directions but there is no hostility or violence. I would always wake up just as I noticed their similarity. (107 words)

I was talking to the baby and I referred to her as "Little Party Girl" and I am sure I meant it as a word of endearment, Barbara's reaction was just completely baffling to me.

I was a candidate for the witness protection program and I dreamed that I was being relocated to California. I was extremely upset and sobbing hysterically because of the thought of never seeing friends or family again. The morning of the day that I was supposed to leave, for some reason I was up, stripping beds. I could feel the sheets in my hands, once I bent down and touched a bare mattress. But then I paused and realized that I didn't even know what was expected of me, why was I stripping beds? I don't even know what I am supposed to be bringing with me. (107 words)

Everywhere that I touched, I was finding clutter. There was a lot of dirty laundry. If I touched the floor I would feel a small pile of dirty laundry. I opened up a drawer of a night stand and pulled out a rolled up dirty dishtowel. The scene changed then and I was at my daughter Robin's house. Where she was living in the dream was not her real house, it seemed that her house was a good sized house and for some reason my son and I had to walk home. We were in a very small entryway, I knew that I was going to be carrying something as we walked home. I don't know what it was but I knew it was going to be cumbersome and so would interfere with easy walking. I considered taking a bus. Anyway, my son, knowing that we were going to have to walk home, or because I had led him to believe so, he walked out the door and it was raining so I brought him back inside because I realized he was in his stocking feet. I bent down to help him find and put on his shoes and I felt that his little socks were wet naturally because he had stepped on wet ground. Then the scene changed again and however we got back here, we were back in our own apartment and there was someone here to visit and she was sitting on my son's bed. She is a very good friend of mine, a lady close to my age, and she greeted us and I knew by her voice who it was and I knew at the same time that I was thinking about my son's grandmother. In the background, in another room, a radio was playing. I also heard the phone ringing. The phone was on a wall, not where it really is in my kitchen. I reached to pick it up and that's where I woke up because my phone was really ringing. (338 words)

A very long time friend, Jack, had picked me up at point A and gave me a ride to point B, but point B was not home it was someone else's home. But then Jack left and this person was a stranger to me. Seemed like a young man, I didn't feel awfully uncomfortable because I didn't feel afraid, he seemed to be very welcoming to both my son and I. But I was confused. I didn't know why I was there. I didn't know why Jack hadn't just brought me home. That was it. (95 words)

I was holding a waste basket and I was picking up trash from the front porch and front lawn. Pieces of rolled up newspaper, paper I was putting it into this basket and from this basket I poured it into a cardboard carton because it was trash day, the barrels were out by the curb and I was going to put this box and all into the barrel. But then I realized that the trash truck was already there and because of our method of pick-up which involves the hydraulic arms where they pick up the whole barrel and dump it into the truck, I was concerned that it would be unsafe for me to go over there and drop this box into the barrel. Then I heard someone outside of the truck who let me know that it would be perfectly safe to do it and I did. (149 words)

Katy is a young woman that I've know for 4 or 5 years but I only see her once a year and that's when we're both attending the same annual retreat in April.. This April, Katy was there and shared with us that throughout the year she had had a very serious, very involved illness which left her in a wheelchair. On this night I dreamed of Katy and I was in a room where she was and Katy had been healed, at least she was walking.

Here I am again with clothes. I was pulling clothes, linen and clothing, this time not dirty, they were clean, I knew it, I was not pulling them straight up out of a laundry basket, Instead I was pulling them toward me. It was comparable to a very, very large glove compartment, it was very deep. I am saying glove compartment so you will understand how I was pulling out that way, and I'm pulling and pulling these sheets and pieces of clothing that need to be folded and put away. By the time the dream ended, I had made a very large dent in this mess of clean laundry. (110 words)

There was another girl her name was Lindsy, much younger than I, but Lindsy and I had been taken to the basement of a building, don't know by whom, there was one person there who seemed to be in control of us. I had a feeling this was a gang related thing. I had no clue; what we were supposed to have done, what they thought we had done, but he had placed 2 high stools, like the ones at my breakfast bar, up against a brick wall. Lindsy was already seated on hers, I was still standing, being given my instructions by this creep, who had handed us each, I don't know if these were packages of juice, made of a type of heavy duty foil paper, very good for like taking to a beach or something,. She already had hers and I was being handed mine, and hearing the instructions, however these 2 bags were filled with oil. We were being instructed to sit on these stools and drink this oil. I could hear Lindsy, it was terrible, out of fear or absolute obedience, was drinking this stuff down like a glass of water if you were thirsty. I could hear her swallowing and I remember thinking "I can't drink this poison, its going to make me very sick." Right after I heard her drinking, I heard this extremely violent vomiting, it was Lindsy, which then induced my own. I had raised mine to my lips but I never did take a drink of it. Thank goodness, the scene changed and I was in the same building, but in a higher level of it and I was in what felt like a very large, comfortable apartment that was mine. It was my living quarters. A neighbor had come over from across the hall telling me there was something on TV which I might enjoy watching and I said, "Yes, that I would, thank you, I'll watch it on my own." He became a little bit offended and wanted to know why and I said "Because if I want to get up and fix myself a cup of coffee or something, I could." The scene changed one more time and I was walking down, the same building, I left my apartment evidently, I was walking down a rather long corridor, and I was being careful, I was being careful because I didn't know what obstacles might be in the way. I reached the end of it and I went through a door and was on the outside of the building. Oddly, outside of the building, I felt counter tops that had cabinets underneath just like you would have in a kitchen, and I was opening them up to investigate, I found there were some dishes, some of which were perfectly empty. Everything was very dirty and I remember thinking "What an absolute waste of good material, and why would anyone want to live like this out doors?". (498 words)

I was in a place I was unfamiliar with but I was in the living room, I knew that. I was sitting on the floor in the middle of the room. There was no furnishings in it at all, I have no idea why I was there. I was aware that behind me, sort of at the far wall there were 2 boys. They seemed oriental I could hear their murmured voices, but I couldn't understand what they were saying because I do believe they were talking in their native tongue. I knew though, that these 2 boys had been brought there to be tortured before being killed. Now in the kitchen which was in front of me, there was another boy, and all of them seemed to be around the same age and I would guess, from the voices, 10 or 11 years old. The one in the kitchen didn't seem to be in any particular danger, he was just out there playing with a small sized ball I would say, a Ping-Pong ball or a superball or maybe he was just simply bouncing it around. I don't know what happened. I don't want to know. (197 words)

I'm back at my old job again, the radiology office. I told you I was a darkroom tech, and in the dream I was back in the very familiar darkroom. One of the first jobs of the day was to turn on the darkroom dryers where the film would go to be dried. I was trying to turn these 2 switches on. The top one worked fine, the bottom one was defective. I got irritated, I knew there was a short in it but there was a female patient in my darkroom standing at the top part of the dryer which is like a counter top. She was standing there writing out the last of her wedding invitations. I wanted her to get out of my way. Also in that room was a device called a pass box. That's a lead lined box where the films, in their lead cases, were passed between the x-ray room and the darkroom so that they were totally safe from any light exposure. I reached my hand up, on top of this pass box for some reason and there was a whole stack of already done wedding invitations and then a friend of mine, Neal was there and I don't know what he was supposed to be doing, but he was conducting some kind of a raffle. If you put in two 5 dollar bills, and if you were very lucky, it could increase to 200 dollars so I took my wallet and gave him a 10 dollar bill, thinking that that should be as good as two 5 dollar bills, or does he really want two 5's.

I was there things were in quite a bit of disorder, my reason for being there, again, was a meeting that I was supposed to be attending. I left the building and outside I was walking either through melted snow or puddles of rain. I was also aware that walking around those grounds were quite a few people, there were young adults, there were children and there were even people in state politics. (111 words)

Food again.

I am sitting in Sandra's kitchen. I know its a kitchen because it is very similar to my kitchen. The layout is exactly the same. I am eating some delicious sandwiches made out of crusty rye bread and ham and cheese. Big, thick sandwiches. In reality I have no idea who this Sandra is but in my dreams I appear to know her. She is a German woman with a high voice and a very pleasant accent, she's very friendly. I am enjoying these delicious sandwiches so much that I don't want to leave, but I have to catch a train. I know I have to catch a train, I keep telling Sandra that I have to catch a train but she keeps offering me more sandwiches and I keep staying to eat them even though I have to catch this train to where ever it is, I don't know where. It's not made clear in the dream. I remember the taste of the delicious ham and cheese and the rye bread, hearing Sandra's laughter and high pitched chatter, being aware of being in her kitchen, sitting at her table, touching the table with my fingertips, tapping my feet on the floor and this impending urgency to catch this train, although it wasn't so urgent, I really didn't want to leave because I was enjoying her company and the sandwiches so much.

And she said she would but she kept saying "I'm gonna be late for work! I'm going to be late for work!"

We were driving somewhere to go to lunch and this song came on the radio, it was not a song I had ever heard before, it was an instrumental, it was very strange, it almost sounded like sitar music, like Indian type music. She liked it but I didn't, but I was in her car so I couldn't say a whole lot and I said "oh" and then it paused and I thought it was over and she said, "oh no, its changing, it'll do a variation, you'll see what it does." And the tune it was playing, when it first came on the radio, it was in a major key and then they did the same thing over but it was in a minor key. The same sort of tune but it was in a minor, it was very strange, and I woke up before the song ended, I was still riding in her car.

I laughed and made a comment about it being strange, 2 guys kissing, and then I thought, that was funny, I shouldn't have said that because one of them is not a guy, one of them is S, a friend of mine from Delaware. The next thing I knew, I was walking with her and I said I had just come from the airport and asked her what she was doing and she said that she wasn't going home until tomorrow so I said "lets go to lunch." Then we were at this school for blind children and I thought we would just go downstairs to the snackbar and have lunch, and we decided not to do that, and I said that there was a pizza shop down the street and she said "well I saw a McDonalds down there" so we started walking and immediately we were at the McDonalds and we went in and somebody was frying doughnuts and I could hear someone saying that they were using all this grease to fry the doughnuts and you could hear them sizzling because of the cheap grease they were using, the donuts weren't good for you to eat, and then the lady said something about the food that was ready and I thought it was mine and I hadn't even ordered yet and finally I did order and that was the end of the dream.

We were on vacation with my cousin G, I haven't seen him in years, we went mountain climbing and went up a very rigorous climb that was almost too much for me. We made it to the top, to a little precarious ledge, we were sitting on this thing and all I had to hold onto was a plastic pole, stuck down into this soft, earthy ground, and one little place to put one foot to keep me from falling back down the mountain. I was sitting there thinking how difficult it was and I was scared up there and then my wife was beside me and she said that my twin brother T was down at the bottom, in tears, he was lying down, he just couldn't make it and he was upset and it was just too much for him, and my cousin came up, just walked right up and was having a good time and was talking to us and we told him, we admitted it was just too much for us and he apologized and said he was really sorry and that he just hadn't realized. Then, I remember I had a big 2 liter pop bottle and I was telling my wife some sort of story, explaining to her how much the bottle cost... "it was $1.29" or something like that and here's what happened to it I just threw it off the mountain and it went crashing down to the bottom somewhere. Then we talked for a while. Then there was someone else there, I don't know who it was, but when we were talking about how difficult it was he said, "well I believe in giving it the old Marine try, that means you ask God for help 101 times and usually that works." I was thinking about that. Then we decided to go back down and in going back down, I found that there was a paved way that we could make it, very easily, it was just like a steep slope going down, like a sidewalk. So we went back down, and we were in a house and my cousin was still there and I found this old knife that I wanted to have sharpened. And the blade was split at the tip so it had 2 points, like a fork almost, it was split right in the middle and my cousin showed me, he said "come right on down this other little slope to this ledge", this was still in the house though. He had somehow used the computer to create a vibration so that when I took this knife and held it against the flat surface of the cement, it was vibrating like crazy, and I was able to sharpen the blade by holding it for quite a long while, like 5 minutes on each side, flipping it over, feeling the edge to make sure it was getting sharp and then E, my wife, was lying down right next to us on the couch, trying to sleep and she began to complain about the noise it was making and how it would wake up the neighbors and she said "you know how these people around here swear!" And I said "I don't care, its not making that much noise and they were going to have to put up with it or I might just have to stab somebody! Once I had this thing sharpened" And we all had a good laugh at that. I remember thinking that I've got to get my cousin to explain to me how he did that, how he was able top do that with the computers, setting up that field that would make this knife vibrate.

I was in a mobile home, decided to go have a cup of tea, on the way into the kitchen, I got deluged with some water or something and I stepped in it and it sprayed almost up to my face and I remember thinking that I had almost hit my eye with it. I thought, did the dog wet on the floor, or, I couldn't figure out what it was, and then I walked into the kitchen, and I was in bare feet and didn't have any clothes on and I was walking around in there, touching the refrigerator, and the sink and I was thinking, "boy, I hope there's nothing faulty in here, nothing electrical or I'm going to get shocked because I was in bare feet and it was a tile floor, water on the floor. I walked over too the stove and put the tea kettle on and the electric stove on and was heating up the tea, and went back into the other room and all of a sudden heard this really loud noise, super loud, vibrating noise and at first I thought it was an airplane, I couldn't figure out what it was but it was shaking the whole house, and then it subsided and we never did figure out what it was.

I was at the Pittsburgh Blind Association I think it was, and was sitting beside a man, a friend of mine who was being forced out of his job, he used to be the assistant manager there and he was just sitting there biding his time because there was no work for him to do, he was ready to retire and had been waiting for that to happen, he was on the telephone, talking to somebody, then he got off and then I was on the phone talking to somebody, was talking to him about cassette recorders and he was saying to me that the only problem with this cassette recorder is that you can only put "one resistor battery" in it, whatever that means. Then I remember that my son was supposed to come pick me up but he was out running around. Then I was on a bus, talking to this woman who was a friend of mine but who is dead, and she wasn't dead at that point, I was talking to her about nothing in particular. Then I got off the bus and was walking, holding on to the bus driver's arm with one hand, somebody else with the other and they were both going in different directions, trying to pull me in different directions and I was laughing and said to the bus driver "hey, you guys know you're pulling me in 2 different directions?" So I let go of one of them and walked with him. The next thing I knew there was a cab that I was in with a friend of mine, and we were supposed to get dropped off on the south side but he accidentally dropped us off on the north side. The driver got out and was walking with us, realized we were on the north side. The cabby apologized and we got back in the cab and the driver told us he would take us where we wanted to go.

I was looking for books from a Braille Bible and I had to give some kind of report or do something in church, was looking for a particular book and was having trouble finding it. My friend S was there and while I was feeling around on the shelves trying to find the books I happened to notice there was a nice bugle on the floor. It seemed to have 2 bells on it instead of just one. I thought to myself, "Ooh, as soon as I'm done finding these books I've got to ask S about playing that bugle, see what it sounds like."

Then I dreamed I was sitting in front of my wife who was in a reclining chair and we were talking and started kissing and my son was supposed to be going to an amusement park later that morning ands I was asking her how he was going to get there. She said she was not riding him and we began to make plans for the rest of the day. I was thinking that we would be alone later and that it would be a good time to get some lovemaking in. (92 words)

I was walking with my cane and I started to cross the street and a man and a lady started to help me, seemed like one was holding onto each of my arms and as we crossed I kept thinking that the man was getting too close to me, I could feel the front of him bump against me and I thought he's closer than he should be and it kind of repulsed me and I wanted to get away from him. Then, we got across the street and there was some sort of barrier where they were doing some kind of work. There was a wooden plank there and the people who were doing the work said that they had just finished and that they would open it up so I could walk across. They removed the barrier but left the wooden plank there. I walked across, actually along it, it was following a sidewalk. Then I found myself in someone's house who lives in an alley near us, I have no idea who she was. I found myself sitting at her table and I had a bag with me that had 3 peaches in it. I was sitting at her table, eating her peaches and I couldn't believe the size of the seeds in those peaches, they were just huge! I thought; "these can't be peaches, these have to be some other kind of fruit, because the seeds are just way bigger than they should be." And they didn't even taste like peaches, they were more like figs or some other kind of fruit. (266 words)

I was with my brother, most of the time, sometimes it may have been my so in, I was walking down this path and I came to this wooden bridge and I walked to the end but was afraid to go any further because I thought that it might go into the water. My brother called me back and said "come on, you've got to come back this other way. There was a shed there, a really small, wooden house of a thing, and I could get into it but there was no opening to get out of the other side to get out. He kept calling me and saying "you've got to come through here, this is the only way to get through here to get back." I said "Well, I didn't have to come through here going down, why do I have to go through here going back?" and he said, "well, you just have to. Its too far to go around it." He insisted that I try to get out of this thing and the wood in it was all old and rotted, so I started ripping pieces of it off, until I made room for me to get out. And I kept tearing at it and finally managed to make a space big enough for me to crawl out and drop down to the ground on the other side if it. I felt really guilty about it, thinking "boy, I'm really tearing this place up" and I asked my brother if he thought anybody saw me and he said "yeah! A lot of people did." And I asked him what that shed was for and he said "That's where they do people's taxes." And I felt bad about this and I thought I should really find out who owns this and pay them for ripping it up even though it was in bad shape. Then we were on a bicycle and we were going really fast along these roads, I was riding on the back of it, leaning back on what I remember used to be called a sissy bar. My brother was peddling and we were going so fast it was almost as if we were on a motorcycle. It was a bike though, it was so quiet and he just seemed to be peddling it effortlessly. I remember saying to him "Let's stop at Butler's store on the way home and get something to drink, like a pop or something." The next thing I knew we were in some doctor's office and it had something to do with taxes but they were doing a kind of cursory examination of people and there was a couple across from us we were talking to. A woman came out of the inner office and called me instead of my brother but it was my brother that was supposed to be examined. She called J but I said, "no, its T that you want, his name is T" so he went in with her and I was talking to the couple and I was explaining to them how my brother and I used to go for a few beers when we were young and how we used to drink it by the quart sometimes and all this stuff. And then the man and the woman started to say that they were going to go to a restaurant and get something to eat. He said "Honey, if there was a restaurant near here I would go right now and get us something to eat. (595 words)

I dreamed that I was thinking about how I am different at work because of my blindness and how I'll never be like other people. The next thing I know, I was standing at the kitchen sink eating out of the sink with a fork and I knew exactly what I was eating, I could taste it even. We have some noodles with vegetables, like a pasta salad, that you just put in a microwave and mix with water and heat up. I was eating that out of the sink and I was thinking to myself I shouldn't be eating out of the sink, that's not very sanitary, I should be using a plate, but then I thought, well, I'm blind and that's why I'm eating out of the sink.

I was in a meeting with a bunch of blind people, all friends of mine, and I said to one of them "I forgot to bring my slate and stylus," which is what we write with, and the person next to me said that I could borrow hers and asked if I would take the notes from the meeting with it. I agreed to. The slate was really unusual, it had an extra metal piece in it and the stylus had a plastic flange coming out of both sides of it, and I thought "Boy that's really ingenious, that way if you drop it it won't roll away". So I began to take notes and I could feel the heaviness of the Braille paper, heavier than what I normally use, and I thought "well, I guess I can do it this one time" and I wrote a few things down. Then a male friend, J from [Piedmont] came in, and although I didn't hear his voice, I could hear people greeting him and I got the feeling that he wasn't feeling real well. Then I was outside walking in front of the AT&T building with my new graphite cane which I recently got, and it kept pulling to the left toward the building, almost as if it were a divining rod or something, and I thought that was really strange and I got back in the meeting and I started telling everybody "boy, you know, this new graphite cane really wanted to come into this building, I could feel it pulling towards the left as I walked across in front of the building."

All I could remember was 2 women walking with me somewhere and giving me some assistance and then we were in a car, I was in the front seat with them, there were four people in the front seat, 1 person to my left and 2 women to my right. I remember thinking "that's odd, there's 4 people in the front seat and there seems to be room for all of us." (72 words)

We were on a trip somewhere and we made a stop to go to the restrooms. I went into this huge place and was trying to find the urinals and I was having trouble finding them and I think that at one point I had no clothes on, and I didn't quite understand that. I was wandering around in this big square room. At one point my wife came to the door and asked if I was ready to go and I said "I'd be another minute" and I went back in and tried to find a urinal, and I couldn't, and finally some man inside there helped me find it and I went to the bathroom and went back out and got in the car and we went back on our way to wherever we were going. And then I remember the reason we were at this place was to take a urine specimen which I was supposed to bring with me and didn't. So I tried to make a joke I kept calling "I forgot my pee! I forgot my pee!" and everyone was laughing but they weren't going to go back there for it and I thought it was really bad that I'd left it there. (209 words)

Another sexual dream. I dreamed that I was lying in bed and was touching my wife, and she was getting excited, actually came to climax and I said "we have to get up and go to the bathroom before we continue." Apparently I must have had to go pretty badly, with those 2 dreams but I could remember it very clearly, how I was touching her, her breathing and all that. (71 words)

I was at a Council of the Blind meeting and I realized I had been sleeping and I realized that I was secretary and should have been taking notes. I didn't know what to do, I didn't have a tape recorder with me, I hadn't been paying attention, and I didn't even have a slate and stylus. I thought, "should I borrow one from somebody?" ^Then T, one of the other members told me that he wanted me to remind him of something, because he had to do it and I thought I didn't know how I was going to do this. I was just appalled that I had been sitting there sleeping in the meeting. (116 words)

I tried to check the time on my talking clock (and, by the way I have had this dream numerous times over the past few years) but the clock malfunctioned, either the battery was going dead or something, and when I pressed the button for the time it started to say a bunch of things about the computer keyboard, and it was just not acting the way it should at all. I knew there was something wrong with it and I was afraid I had slept in and missed my wake-up time for work. (94 words)

I was in the rearmost seat of a station wagon, where the seat faces back out of the rear of the car. I was sitting on the driver's side and sitting to my left was my Brother in law D from Kentucky. He was driving the vehicle and I remember thinking "boy, I wonder how he's driving this thing from all the way over here in the back." I could tell by his voice that he was turning his head around to look forward to see what's going on but he was talking to me. For the most part we were just riding along and he was looking at me mostly and yet he was able to control the car. (120 words)

I went into this nut shop I used to go into to buy peanuts and cashews and things and I went in and thought, "boy this place is really small, they must have changed it around" which was really weird because they had just taken up half the space that used to belong to Wiener World [which in reality is about a half block away on the other side of an alley] and made the nut shop really big, but now its small again. I went in and talked to the person, trying to decide what kind of nuts I wanted and I couldn't think of anything that sounded good because it was early in the morning and I didn't want peanuts and I didn't want any other kind, but I asked him though, if they had anything they could mix with chocolate covered raisins and they said they didn't have anymore chocolate covered raisins.

I had to cross an intersection, turn left and cross the other way and instead of walking, I got down on my knees and was crawling across and I was thinking "boy, I can hear the traffic better this way than if I was standing up, but it's really hard to go fast enough to make it across before the light changes." I got across and began to turn left and my friend M was there, who is also blind in reality, and he started to tell me "you're going the wrong way, we're going the wrong way." And I said, "This is 4th avenue here isn't it?" and I insisted on going that way and I knew I was right but he kept trying to get me to go the other way. (133 words)

I had to go for a physical and I remember getting there, my wife drove us up, I was supposed to be there at 1:00 and it was 2 minutes to 1:00 when we got there. I checked my watch and said "this is great, we're right on time, its a good thing we left when we did." We got in there and the nurse took me and had me step up on a scale, was weighing me. Then I got up on the table and the doctor came in, he had a deep voice. I remember the sound of his shoes walking, he had a nice firm walk He came in and started talking to me and gave me a shot I asked him what kind of shot it was and he said "It's an ACD shot." My wife is a nurse (in reality) and we were trying to figure out what kind of shot that was. She said she didn't know. He gave me the shot in the upper part of my left arm and it was somewhat painful and I sort of winced a little bit, but I said it didn't hurt that badly. I asked him what it was and he said it was a cardiac shot, maybe hepatitis, I asked what the A was for and he said that was a shot for marijuana. I asked what he meant, and he said "it lessens the effect of marijuana if you smoke it." I laughed and said "Oh great! Now I'll have to smoke twice as much marijuana." And he laughed and I said "no, I don't smoke marijuana" [in reality, not for the last 25 years]. Then, while I was still on the table, there was a loud buzz, a doorbell, but the person rang it excessively long and it was excessively loud, and the doctor groaned "oh boy" but he went to the door and opened it. Then this man with a very effeminate voice came in and said he had flowers to deliver and the doctor said "Oh gosh! Those weren't supposed to be delivered here!" Then he called to his nurse "Bevvv! Come in here and take care of this, these are supposed to be delivered (I think he said) to my wife." So she came in and took care of the man with the flowers. The next thing I remember I was out in my backyard sitting at a picnic table eating dinner with my mother and some other people. My mother was sitting right to my right. I don't remember what we were eating, but the yard was kind of sloped down and we were back towards the end of it and we were sitting there eating and talking. I mentioned to my mother that I had had a shot and said "I bet I could probably drink beer now and I bet I could have a few now." [Reality, I have been a recovering and sober alcoholic for 14 years] And my mother said "Oh, I don't know what I would do if I started to find beer bottles and found out that you were drinking again." I started to laugh and said "well, you know there have been a number of times when I've had a few! It doesn't really bother me if I just drink beer and don't drink too much." She didn't sound too believing but said "oh, that's interesting." My thoughts and been that maybe if this shot for marijuana was effective, it might allow me to drink like a regular drinker without having any bad effects from it. My mother left. They had all left and gone somewhere. I was by myself, and I thought I had better start cleaning up the dishes and I picked up my plate and I had a glass which I left there, and started to walk. I heard a splash and realized that I was right along side of a river and I didn't want to fall in the river, and I couldn't exactly remember which way I had to go to get up to my house. I was pretty sure I could feel that the land sloped a little bit, and I thought I was okay and so I started to walk in generally the right direction, but I sort of veered off to the side of my yard and got tangled up in some bushes that are there. I kept walking and at one point I brushed against a wire antenna that I have in my back yard in reality and I remember thinking "boy this thing is really hanging too low. I should get a pole to prop up the middle with" I kept walking and got myself straightened out and got up to the top near my house, where a patio is and a dishwasher was there, and I started to put my plate inside the dishwasher, and I was going to go back and get some more when I started to hear all these voices from inside my basement. It was my neighbor E from across the street, with a bunch of people and they were talking, it was as if she was giving them a tour of my house. Then she came out and started thanking me and then my mother came out and she thanked us both for being such nice people and being such good help. I remember saying "E you're always welcome." Then she was leaving. (898 words)

I was in a class, possibly for computer programming. There seemed to be many familiar people in the class with me and the instructor was very friendly and it seemed as if I was sitting in the front of the room and he was sitting in the back, and he came up to me and said "I was going to buy you an "Opticon" but the administration wouldn't let me, they cost $6000 but I brought you a Braille writer and I bought you all this other stuff and I just wondered if you were familiar with it because you are going to need them in this class." I remember thinking "I'm glad he didn't buy an Opticon because I don't remember how to use one. So I began to unpack the box he gave me, and there did appear to be an Opticon and had a little hand held camera with it. A little box that had something similar to a little Braille display, maybe a one line Braille display, maybe an Opticon. I started taking out this thing and all the accessories that came with it and I was amazed at the different plugs and cords and there were adapters like standard serial port adapters for computers, there were some that were offset between the male and female end of it. There were some wires with like plastic keys hanging off of them. My co-worker, M happened to be there then and she said "Oh, this is interesting, you could probably stick this in a car's ignition to start it if you happened to lose your key." We had a laugh about that. I just kept looking at these different pieces. There was one piece that I fitted onto the back of the machine with a little flange, it was some sort of little plug. Throughout the dream everything seemed pretty familiar to me and I seemed to know what everything was for. Then M said she had to go and do an interview and I said "where's everybody else?" and she said "I have no idea, they all left at 8:00 and they just left at 8:00 and I'm left with the work to do." [An Opticon is a device which converts printed material into tactile images that actually feel like the printed letters. It has largely gone out of vogue for the last 15 or 20 years.] (368 words)

I was at the school for blind children, walking down the hall in the middle of the night, toward the younger kids' dorm area. For some reason I wanted to go down there and get a drink of water out of the fountain and the house mother stopped me and hollered at me and asked what I was doing there and I said that I just wanted a drink and its a better fountain down here and I thought to myself 'F your mother' and then I thought I'm glad I didn't say that out loud.

I was in the computer room in my basement here and my friend J's daughter was here with me. She was trying to print some stuff and I was helping her with the computer and I was asking her if she ever used Print-Shop. And we were talking about Q&A and WordPerfect and I forgot to run my speech program and was having trouble figuring out where I was and she was kind of helping me. In the dream his daughter, who in reality is 40 sounded like she was 20. Next I remember being at the Guild for the Blind in Hingeville. I was walking through there smoking a pipe and the tobacco smelled really good, like cinnamon [I haven't smoked a pipe in 10 years in reality]. I was walking through there talking to some people and all of a sudden I could hear all these little kids coming in and somebody came over to me and said "do you hear the fire?" At first I said no, but then I heard some sirens off in the distance. They said it was next door at a restaurant which I remember having been in before. Then my wife was there and she was looking and I asked "How bad does it look?" and she said "Oh, it's really a bad fire! A good one, really ablaze." Then she took me over there and we walked into the driveway and we could hear the men up above, working away on the roof. One of the firefighters yelled down "What are you doing here? Get out of here now!" And I responded "I'm just glad I had a chance to hear this." I asked my wife again how it looked and she still said that it looked pretty bad. Then rain started to fall on us but it may have been water from the hose. I said, lets get out of this or we'll have to go home and take a bath. I also remember at some point, being able to smell the smoke, it had a rather acrid smell typical of house fires. (344 words)

I was up in my bedroom trying to change a light bulb over a closet door, which isn't really there. While I was changing the one over the bed, which really is there, I also installed something which was squirting water straight down and I don't know what it was for, but it was supposed to be doing it. The problem was it was squirting too much water and I couldn't seem to get it to stop and it just kept going and going and I remember thinking that it might have had something to do with an airplane.

I was in a hotel and I woke up with my wife and I said "Whoa! We're in England!" and we both remembered that we were. We were on a vacation I guess and we were talking and I was listening to the other guests in the other hotel rooms that I could hear. Then I heard a man open our door and I heard him say "Nope, he's not here." Then I heard him go down the hall opening other doors and I could hear him say "His mother's not here." Some kid was lost and they were looking for his mother. But the kid was speaking Spanish, not English. I heard a woman say something to the kid which I understood to mean "Can I pick you up?" He was like a little 2 or 3 year old. I thought I heard her say "Me exceptuo alor" or something, some words, I don't know what they mean. Then someone came into our room and was talking about coffee. We said that we'd like to go get a cup and she said "well, I already made it for you, it's right here." She handed me a cup and it was hot and the top felt like the bottom and so I turned it upside down and that top felt like the bottom too, and I thought I was going to spill it, that there must have been a lid on it so I turned it over again and felt it and there was this flat disc that was there instead of the top. I asked what it was there for, "to keep the heat in?" And she said, "no, it's to muddy it up a little bit." I tasted it and it was okay but there were some coffee grinds in it. Then there was no longer a woman there but a man and he said "well we put onion in the coffee and it makes it taste better." And I was tasting it and it did taste pretty good. Then I thought, I should turn on my radio and tune across the FM band and see what the local stations and programs are like. Then we were thinking about going on a tour somewhere and we asked the woman if there were any tourist attractions that we can walk to from here. Its funny, I never did hear anyone with a British accent, they all sounded like Americans, even when I was tuning around on the radio. (419 words)

I was sitting on the porch with my wife and son and my wife said "This is going to be my last smoke, I am not going to smoke anymore after this. I'm quitting after this one." Then we were talking about cancer and why smoking is bad for you. Then she lit up another one and said "This one is going to be my last one." Then the scene switched, and we were inside some kind of church and somebody, a young girl perhaps, was up front talking about "since God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son" and was trying to explain something about John 3:16. But I was trying to explain something totally different to my son, just sitting there talking right out loud, thinking I should really be quiet because we're disrupting the service, but we went right on with our conversation anyway.

My daughter called home to tell us that our son had spent 100 dollars yesterday that he'd gotten from selling a snake that he'd owned. He actually had owned a snake and it had just been sold, he was supposed to go out and get the money yesterday and in the dream she said that he had spent the hundred dollars because he didn't want to give it to us. And I was saying "what in the world did he spend that much money on? Was it drugs or what was it?" And she said she didn't know. (98 words)

I was in my office and I was going to go to lunch, walking over toward the coat rack I remembered saying "I think I'm going to blow the rest of this day off." One of my co-workers was kidding me and she said "I heard that!" Then I was supposed to go to a meeting the Cleveland Blind Association and I went to the coat rack and I couldn't find my coat. I was feeling all the different coats, even reached into the pocket of one of them which felt similar to mine, and I found a bunch of balled up papers and different things and I realized that it wasn't my coat. I had to go through the whole coat rack one coat after another until I found mine. They all seemed to feel the same and I had a cab waiting for me so I was really in a hurry to go. I finally did find it, it was way over on the right hand end of the coat rack, probably took five minutes to go through all of the coats [That has never happened to me, I can usually reach right over and feel the texture of my coat.] So I went downstairs and I remember thinking "Oh, at least the cab is coming right here for me I don't have to walk a couple blocks to meet it." The next thing I knew, I was at the Blind Association and I walked in. I couldn't remember exactly which way to go. The more I thought about it the more it seemed like the school for blind children that I went to as a kid, than the blind association. But I got there and was walking and one of the women who worked there was kind of helping me and she said "now we turn to the right here" then she grabbed me and said "its very narrow here" she thought I was going to bump into something. Then we ended up in a big open reception area in the front and again I was waiting for this cab. I don't know how I got to the Blind association but she said, I was right next to this big window in the front of the place, she said "sit here in this prom chair" and I said "boy, I bet I'm less nervous today then when I went to the prom." Then we started talking about the prom and I said that neither of my kids had ever gone to the prom. I remember going to the bath room and then coming out and they said, "Your cab was here but he didn't want to wait so he went to have lunch at the restaurant next door and he'll be back to pick you up." So I waited about 15 or 20 minutes and he never did come back to pick me up. (468 words)

There were a lot of my relatives at my house from Alabama, including my little nieces, one of whom is 10 years old. We were in the living room and it was early in the morning and she was looking at some novel that she had seen at her mother's house. She asked me who it belonged to, I said I didn't know. I don't remember the name 9of it I had never heard of it. But we were talking and the television was on real low, the stereo was also on low and the radio9 was on in the kitchen. They were all on different stations. We were just talking and I got up to check the mail and as I was reaching into the mail box, someone from across the street said "Hello" and I answered him and then I realized that he wasn't talking to me and I thought "Boy that happens so often. Its so embarrassing to answer and yet you have to answer when you think someone is talking to you. I had some really clear feelings and thoughts about that. Them I got back in and realized there was a napkin stuck to the front of my pants and I thought "Oh boy, I hope nobody noticed that." Then I was talking to my niece and she said something about cutting the grass or raking the leaves or something. I said "well, do you do that at home?" and she said "yeah" and I said, "well if you want to do that here I'll pay you, I'll give you a thousand dollars if you want it just to go out and cut the grass and clean up the yard a little bit." Then we laughed. (291 words)

Then I dreamed that I was at this school for blind children, sitting on this lawn swing, where I went to school as a kid and was talking to a bunch of guys and women who were on the swing with me. There was one across the way from me who was debating whether or not she wanted to stay at this place. It may have been a camp for the blind which I visited years ago. Anyway, she was trying to decide and she knew her boyfriend was going to be there. Then she was sitting close beside me and I put my arm around her shoulders and I thought "boy, I hope this guy doesn't notice this because he's really going to be upset, but this woman is just so nice, I like the idea of having her close to me and I spoke to her and said "you're going to stay here" and she said "I haven't decided" and I said "nope, I've decided for you. You are going to stay here." And I made an announcement to the rest of the group: "This woman is going to stay here for the week, because she wants to, but I have made her mind up for her." I was just squeezing her with my arm around her shoulders, thinking how nice she felt and how upset this guy was going to be when he got there. Then he got there and he wasn't upset. And we were talking and laughing and just sort of carrying on. (258 words)

I dreamed that a couple was involved in some kind of sexual activity and part of it involved going to this hotel bar where we are and having a couple of drinks really fast just to heighten their excitement. They were evidently sexually involved publicly. I'm not sure what they were doing but you could hear them laughing and carrying on. Part of this whole process was they insisted, that I have to have a drink, and I said "I don't drink, I'll have a Coke" and the guy at the bar said here, I'll give you just what they ordered for you and I tasted it and it was just straight whiskey on the rocks and I thought "Boy, this really tastes good, and I don't care if I don't drink or if 'm an alcoholic, I'm going to drink this stuff anyway. Then I was walking back to my room, tasting my drink thinking "Man the aroma and the flavor of this stuff is just great! I've missed this for a long time." (175 words)

One more short dream. I was on a boat, I guess I was in the Navy. I was riding on this ship and suddenly it became nothing more that a life raft , a little inner tube or something, and I was out in the ocean with some guys and we were carrying on, they were sort of tipping me to get me wet. I was thinking "This thing really holds me up well", I'm not a good swimmer by the way, but I thought this was great. I was able to navigate by kicking my feet, could get around where I wanted to and so on. At one point, I think my wife was there. I said "boy its good that you're here. I don't know where I am, if I'm in the middle of the ocean or where I am." But we swam to shore and I could hear the surf coming in, but it was very mild, no big waves or anything, just real calm and comfortable and I was just enjoying it out there. We were swimming into shore that's the last I remember. (188 words)

I was in my grandfather's house in Alabama, and for some reason I was sleeping there. First I think my wife and I were sleeping in a bed in a bedroom there. Then I remember getting a phone call from some guy about a job I had offered, and it was 10:30 at night. I picked up the phone and said "well usually I don't take calls at this time of night, I was asleep." He was very insistent that I had to talk to him and I said "Call me back Monday morning, this can wait." Next I remember, I was sleeping on a table, lying on my stomach, with my legs on the ground and my head and chest, lying on this table in a kitchen. It was my grandfather's kitchen. He was there and my step-grandmother was there I think, and my mother was over to the left of me talking about cooking breakfast and she said "well, I'm just afraid to cook on this old stove, I'm afraid that I might do something to it, its so old." Then I said "Maybe I should go into the bedroom and sleep" and my grandfather said "well there's no bed in there we never put a bed in there." And I said "well yes there is." And he started to get upset and argue with me and I said "Come on with me and I'll show you there's a bed in there!" He followed me in and he saw it and just immediately went out of the room and said that his step son must have put the bed in there without his permission and got upset about it. Then we were back in the kitchen and we were sitting there and there was a little boy there, I don't know who it was. I could hear someone calling him from outside and somebody said "there's your fifta pappy. Your fifth of pappy's calling you." And he said "okay" and I said "What in the world is 'fifta'?" and he said "Oh, its a little store like a 7-11. Its a little store down the road." I could hear someone calling the boy and I thought "well isn't that nice, they have little stores like that, just a nice little neighborhood." [Grandpa has been dead for 15 years.] (383 words)

I was looking at an old manual typewriter and it wasn't working right and I turned it upside-down to put a new ribbon in. I know that's not how you put a ribbon in but that's what I did, I turned it upside-down and could feel the ribbon in there. I followed the route of it so I could tell which way it goes and I thought I'd be able to put the new one in. Then I took it out and I found this little round cylinder like cartridge and it was empty I said "Yep, you can tell the ribbon's gone, because the cartridge is empty." So I got the new one and started trying to put it in, but I never was able to get it in, right, I kept routing it in incorrectly and it seemed longer than it was supposed to be and I just couldn't get it to go in right.

I was in an airport, sitting, drinking a cup of coffee with friends from work and I tasted the coffee and I thought "boy, this stuff has grinds in it and everything, this is supposed to be good coffee but it tastes like old hobo coffee that you make by just pouring coffee in a pan and boiling it." Then I thought I was in an elevator lobby at work, standing, listening to some people talk. Then I recognized my female friend S's voice from New Jersey. She was saying that it costs $6000 dollars per semester to send her son to school. Someone else said "Boy, how do you come up with that much money?" And I just chimed in "Well S is rich and I'm rich too, sometimes I borrow money from her, some-times she borrows money from me, we have lots of it." (146 words)

I was having trouble opening and closing the bedroom door to my room. I checked and noticed that the hinges were coming off. The door was not straight on the hinges. These are new doors that we put in recently. I thought "These doors are really messed up, I don't know if I'm going to be able to fix them or not." I went down to the basement looking for a couple of screws to add to it. I was finding all kinds of screws but not the right size. (90 words)

I was in my old office up on 6th avenue, where I worked about 5 years ago. I was with my old work mate, P, who I haven't talked to in about 10 years. I was back there using my computer and I was in Windows and all of a sudden I got a message through my speech synthesizer that said "fire inside computer" and I went over to P and I said "Hey P, you better take a look at this thing I think its on fire." She looked at it and she said "You're right, it is." But there was a computer program that had a little woman in there and she went and found the fire and put it out with a little fire extinguisher. A couple of minutes later I asked P if it was still on fire and she said "No, she put it out immediately. A couple of times it's flared up but as soon as I see it, the little woman also sees it and puts it out." And I just thought that's amazing! And I thought I wish that I'd backed up my data better because if this fire did a lot of damage in there then I'm going to lose all of that information. (213 words)

Then we may have been on vacation somewhere with a bunch of people who were leaving to go for a walk and I think I was with my daughter.

I was walking down the street with a couple of friends. There was some confusion over who one of the persons was. I thought it was a friend named Skippy and another time I thought it was a friend named KH. They're guys from when I was a teenager. At one point it was definitely Skippy and he kept making comments, making too much noise and I was afraid that we were going to get into trouble. It was the middle of the night and we were out walking. I threatened him that if he did it again that he would be in trouble and he did and so I started beating him. I grabbed him, started slapping him and hitting him as hard as I could, and I just kept it up and kept it up. And I kept asking him to apologize and he wouldn't so I kept beating him. Suddenly I heard him passing gas and he said "oh, I'm shitting all over myself" and I thought "I've gone too far, I've either killed him or done brain damage or something." So I stopped and I ran with the other kids, whoever it was with us, and the next thing I knew, we were inside the kid's apartment but the kid was no longer Skippy, but was a kid named KH. We were in the apartment and I remember thinking "Boy, this place is really sleazy, I don't like it here at all." KH wasn't there and we were really worried about what had happened to him. I didn't know if he had died or if the police had picked him up or what happened. Then for some reason I went in to take a shower and the place was really a pit. The tub was small, and instead of being rectangular the way they usually are, it was really high but it was square. It wasn't very big, I remember climbing up to get into it and the tub kind of moved and I thought "Man, this place just isn't put together very well. I had a hard time getting the curtain closed, and I got shampoo all over my head and the water pressure was so minimal, I could hardly rinse out the shampoo or get my head washed. I was in a hurry and this KH's dad, who I remember as a kid as a real pervert came in and was talking to me and I thought "This guy's going to rape me or something, I've got to get out of here." And he said something like "there's water coming out, you better turn the shower off." And I did, I got out and the next thing I knew, I was outside walking with my son and we had a summons that we had to appear in court that afternoon. I'm not sure what it was for, it had something to do with this incident from the night before I think. It was on really slimy paper, slimy and greasy, like it had Crisco or something all over it. I remember running it under some water and thinking I hope I don't ruin the paper, but I have to get some of this slime off here so I can read it and I had somebody trying to read it for me and that's where the dream ended.

I was in a hotel room with a friend of mine I think his name was JM that I knew years ago. I was sitting on the bed and he was on the other side of the room to my right as I was facing him. He was over where the bathroom would typically be, over by the door of the hotel room. Somebody came in and brought a pistol and said: "Now that you have this job that you have, you're going to have to carry this pistol and I'm going to have to teach you how to use it, and I want to teach you all the safety features, teach you how to carry it properly and teach you how to get it out quickly in case you need it because you know that that could happen."

I was in my church and I was at a counter to buy something. I don't know what it was. A woman from the church came up to me and said that she would take me up to the classroom where we had to go, so I just left a $20 bill on the counter to buy whatever it was. I didn't get anything for the 20 dollars, I just left it there. Then I took this lady's left arm and started walking with her, which is something I never do, unless I have no choice, I always take their right arm with my left arm. But I took the left side and remembered wondering why I had done it. Then we went up and sat down in the classroom. (130 words)

My wife and I were separated and had been for about 6 months and I had to go to our old house to do something and I know that will be uncomfortable. We still get along and everything but its going to feel so strange going there since we're not together anymore. The next thing I remember was being at my in-laws' house with my wife and was in their yard trying to retrieve 2 garbage cans that belong to us. One of them had a lot of garbage in it and was fairly heavy, the other one was empty and I went up into the yard to get the one and I ended up getting in between a bunch of hedges and flower beds and couldn't find my way back out and I had to ask for help. My brother in law Moe, who doesn't live with his wife anymore, in fact lives in another town, was there and he was directing me, telling me where to put my feet without trampling the hedges to get the garbage cans out of there and I ended up spilling all of the garbage out of the full one and I knew that I would have to ask him to help me pick up the garbage.

I was in a dorm room at college and was just getting my stuff unpacked and then this other guy appeared, just appeared and there were 3 people in the room instead of 2. I was really concerned, I didn't know if I liked the guy. I didn't know if all my clothes were going to fit, I started to put my clothes away in the closet and I said: "Are your clothes way over here on the right hand side?" He said "No, mine are all the way over on the left." So I moved everything over to the left and started to hang my clothes up. There was a knock at the door and I went to open the door and there was somebody's guide dog there instead of a person and I thought that was strange, I wonder how it knocked. It came in and I patted it a little bit and I closed the door and I was thinking, I wonder how I'm going to find out who this thing belongs to. (176 words)

I was outside, walking with my cordless phone talking to somebody on the phone and suddenly it stopped and I was wondering, why did it stop? I called the operator somehow, even though it stopped.

I dreamt that I was in school again and that guy who committed suicide a few years ago was there and we were listening to a sewing machine on headphones for some odd reason and then he got into trouble because he was trying to do something, rather, my headphone cord got stuck between the needle and the sewing machine motor so I had to rip that out. Then suddenly my sewing machine was moved to another place in the room, magically it seems, and I was sewing some sort of towel and I was trying to go straight, and I couldn't go straight for some odd reason so I had to remove things to make it go straight, very strange.

One of my ex-girlfriends came up and said that she didn't have anything to do so I brought her back into my bedroom and things had ensued and we did things and of course I woke up which is very frustrating!

I was still in California, traveling on the bus, and wanting to go to the mountains for some odd reason. So I was heading there and then the bus driver stopped the bus and said "I'm sorry, this is up to where we go, unless you give us more money." I got pissed off and said "Well, how much do you want?" and he wanted a big amount of course, and magically I had it and we continued and eventually we got there, got out of the bus, looked at the mountains, I could see them plainly, got back into the bus and drove back home. While driving back home, there was this guy named Bob, a drunk guy that I used to meet on the bus all the time when I used to live at my other address, he was some kind of PC designer or something. In the dream he said "I'll give you this!" It was a small shoe. On the bottom, you would press a button and record, so it was a recording shoe! Then I woke up. (182 words)

A lot of impressions, I can't seem to bring them out they seem to be about the Russel Hill building at the Redwood school [for the blind]. It seemed as if there were a lot of people, I could hear their voices and I could feel their presence. There were no children. It was the children's building. There was some kind of a meeting there. Something to do with a piano. Had to be moved from one area to another and it seemed as if it was upstairs. I could feel my body pushing against it on a ramp and there may have been a hoist involved. The way the dream went, I'm not sure, the way the piano went, it was just messed up. It seemed as if I could feel that it was warm out. (135 words)

I dreamed about some bacon down in the refrigerator. We just bought some bacon and it must have been pretty close to when we woke up. Maybe we'll have it for breakfast. I don't know, I can picture the package, touch it with my hand. I don't know, its a funny thing. (52 words)

this night I had some disjointed dreams, very hard to explain. It seemed like I was switching tools, sorting them by touch, tools for a piano, but there were no pianos in the dream. There was like transferring of things. Later I dreamed that I was in a car, in the back seat and the car swerved around a large curve or a corner and to the left almost to where I had to lay down in the seat. I don't remember anyone else but me and the driver who were in the car. It didn't seem like anything of significance, the tires squealed...that's it for today. (107 words)

I had a dream about 4 to 6 o'clock. It seemed that there was a group of us and people staying at our house here, there were numerous voices. They stayed here and then we took a trip, it seemed like it was up in the Boston area. Its unclear why we did it and everything, but people stayed the night and seemed to be having a real good time and everything and uh, Gee we had plenty to eat...I don't remember cooking anything, we had something to do with a huge clock, it seemed like nothing I have in real life, we went up in this huge bus, I could feel the spaciousness, like a moving room and I could feel the seats by sitting on them or touching. On the bus there seemed to be food and somebody forgot something back here and it seemed like we had to come back. One of those dreams that you didn't want to have end really. I don't remember too many details there, but it was a pretty neat dream, I enjoyed it. It seemed like my father was in this dream and he was much younger than he is now. A lady from our church, KD was driving the bus. I still can't come up with why we were going or what we were doing, we were going to Boston. (230 words)
Blind dreamers (M):#113-06 

I just woke up from a very strange dream. One of the strangest that I've ever had in my life I think. We were somewhere, like part of my mind says it was part of the grounds of the Redwood school and something else says we were somewhere visiting. I guess there was a great many people around and there was seemed like there were lots of activities around everywhere. And the animals, there were a lot of animals around, like there was a circus there. And the elephant was there of course being at a circus, and we had to walk through the feeding area of this elephant and they were saying "That's all right, you can wash off your shoes because the area was...they said that the elephants were eating something like butter, or mashed potatoes and gravy...But you knew while you were walking that you were walking in this really slippery kind of stuff that was a type of thing that you just knew that you had to get your shoes cleaned and they said, "don't worry about it" and we walked for quite a while in this mess and when we came out of it I heard the elephant making that sound, that trumpeting. It didn't seem to bother anybody, it was just there and there was a lot of activity around and it seemed like there was music in the background and everything but I guess the strangest thing about the dream was where we had to walk and it was almost as if we had to walk through some of the waste materials too that the elephant would leave.

I checked the kick plate along the bottom of the refrigerator. Dreamed that the left side of the kickplate was broken and was hanging by a thread and to the point that it couldn't be put on. In reality it is breaking and I have a replacement downstairs to use when it does break. It was so vivid. I pictured myself in our kitchen looking at the kickplate, that is examining it by touch, and the piece was just hanging by a piece of plastic. It was very real. One of the most real dreams I remember having. Nothing was out of place. (103 words)

Very little activity...I dreamed that I was downstairs working on the computer, looking at different discs that would be used in DOS, listening to them through a speaking modem.

I had a dream where there were about 8 of us at the house and we were eating, seemingly picnic style. I remember the taste and the smell of the food. Some of us were eating inside and some outside. We have no facilities for eating outside and so they were just eating on the steps, sitting wherever they can, just milling around eating their food. And Mary and I were the only ones who were blind. I think our friend H was here and it seemed like we were going to some kind of meeting or party afterward. And it was something to do with travel, verbally planning a trip or something. That's pretty vague, but mainly I remember everybody being here seems like people just kind of drifted away. It started out vividly and then it just kind of went off into some kind of oblivion. We were supposed to go somewhere after we ate. (157 words)

I was a witness at the birth of a child. It didn't seem like a hospital, it just seemed like we were in some big room, had to be a delivery room by all practical purposes but it really wasn't I guess. I was allowed to touch the baby as it was coming into the world. I don't know who the lady was and I can't remember anymore. The baby cried and they had me give it a little bit of a spank and it cried and I woke up. This dream was triggered by listening to Rush Limbaugh who was discussing this abortion thing (105 words)

There were a lot of people. There are a lot of people in my dreams. In this case we were sitting at this very very very large table, something vast like 20 feet in diameter or bigger. All these people were sitting around this big round table. I knew that it was round because it was rough around the edges like the bottoms of our chairs, the new chairs that we got and it was very thick and it was like the people were...there was no arguing, there was no...they were just sitting there not really doing anything, nothing ever came to pass. There seemed to be no purpose for the people sitting there and yet I can remember the vastness of the table. I almost think that they weren't sitting as much as they were just...suspended at the table. It felt like we were sitting, but the more I think about it the more I think that the chairs were almost suspended, they were kind of floating. My weight didn't feel like it was pressing on the chair but the people were just kind of talking, but there was nothing resolved or purpose to be there. (197 words)

I was in a van, I don't know who else was there. On the back of the seat where there sometimes are places to put things...This was much bigger than you have in reality because this would just take up too much room. There were a whole bunch of books in there...This book had something to do with health and I also think it had something to do with life in general, politics, whatever, the more I think about it , the more I think it might have been "The way things ought to be" by Rush Limbaugh and I remember taking it out and the weirdest thing was that parts of it was in Braille and parts of it were on tape. Because I could remember feeling the Braille and hearing the tape, in the back of this van...whose van I didn't know and who is driving I don't know...but there I was with this book. (157 words)

I also had another dream and its very vague. Just before I woke up its now 5:00+. I dreamed that there were a lot of cylinders, long cylinders around. The image of these was 4 to 6 feet long, maybe 4 to 6 inches in diameter, maybe a little smaller. They were laying on the ground and I could bend down and feel them. And I could feel them rolling around underfoot I know there s a whole lotta stuff regarding those cylinders. They were various lengths and I remember just that they were very annoying, it was very annoying being around them. (103 words)

I was out in a field, possibly 1977, a lot of grass around and there were a lot of dogs in the area and there was a pile of stones around like somebody moved in and was building a road, not too large stones. I remember picking up the stones and just hurling them violently at these dogs, making every attempt to kill them and feeling very good about it and the dogs were barking. I cannot remember them trying to come after me. Especially this one dog, and from his bark it seemed like a very big dog, a big bark, but it stayed its distance and I must have hit it which I could do only with luck in real life. They didn't run away from the stones that I was pelting them with. I'm not particularly a dog lover but I certainly wouldn't want to harm the animal. (151 words)

Plane crash. I remember being inside this plane and the feeling of acceleration and the feeling of everything associated with the way planes fly...My total fear came later when I was with these strange people. It seemed as if I was the only one among these strangers. Mary wasn't here and it seems no matter how hard I try I couldn't find any familiar people on the plane. There we were flying along, way up there at 30 or 40,000 feet wherever they fly and I knew that plane was going down. I felt the plane lurch and there were strange noises and the plane tipped at about a 60 degree angle down into the earth, I could feel the pressure on my head and neck and the pressure of my head just being pushed into my body, and my body being pressed forward against the seat belt. And I could remember saying "I guess we'll see you later! See you in the next world!" and that was the end of it. The reality of that dream lives with me today and I get little shivers when I think about that dream I could hear the people's voices and screams when the plane tipped up that way. (207 words)

We were only in bed about 15 minutes when I had this dream that an oil tank somewhere was going to blow up. I just knew it! That's the dream where Mary says that I woke up and started shouting: "The oil tanks going to explode!" I remember being around where there was a lot of dirt, we were outside and why I knew that it was going to explode, I don't know. It was warm outside and I felt the dirt. The violence of that dream sent me into a really frightened state. The oil tank never exploded and the plane never crashed and I don't know if the dogs ever died. (113 words)

In bed, I was with my father, I could picture sitting with him in the front seat of his 1987 Dodge 600 and we were going along and he said: "My God I can see the funnel!" A tornado was coming. I said "oh boy!" And we just drive right into it and all of a sudden we're picked up and we're driving and we're spinning around in the air. We're just spinning and spinning and spinning like a top, but still we're able to propel ourselves forward and when the tornado goes away, we're set down just as nice as you please and we're able to keep right on driving. Just as if nothing has happened. (117 words)

We were at camp Harkness. We had an absolutely wicked, violent thunder storm, one of the worse I can remember being at camp, at 2 or 3 in the morning. I was awaked by a tremendous peal of thunder. I dreamed that the walls of the cabin were falling in on us. I was screaming in my sleep (according to witnesses) for everyone to get up and wake up and get out of the cabin because the walls were falling in. And no one wanted to go out in the rain. I remember trying to hold up the walls with my hands, but it was only the thunder making me dream that way I guess. (115 words)

It felt like we were flying in this plane, seems like there were a lot of people around, by the sound. The plane had to land, and it landed right in our living room. I Guess it was flying up around the ceiling. You need room to fly to move a plane around and so the pilot just took it outside and landed it but I don't know where it landed. It tried to land somewhere downstairs (in the living room). (81 words)

My mother and father in law and Mary and I went up to our friend C who lives in Arlington Mass. So we brought him down here and he had some business cards that went into a notebook. I could feel that one part of the business card was raised so that it looked like a separate little part, but it was raised like a little book and you could flip some lose parts of that card, and it went onto the ring of the notebook. Sitting there, and it took no time to get from his house to our house over on H drive. My father in law was helping C get these cards into this book. During this time, my mother in law called the Hs, J and G and asked them to come over and have some coffee with us. I woke up after the phone call, never found out if they came or not. Why C would have business cards, and a business card holder like the one that Mary gave me for my little wedding thing. I don't know. (184 words)

Mary and I were somewhere. We had to fill out these forms, it had something to do with getting into a place or something. There were a lot of people around whom I cannot identify but we could hear them or occasionally brush into one. It seems as if the forms were something which we should have filled out before we got there. Apparently everyone there had to fill out these forms and before we could get there to this place, it might have been summer, it was warm out, may have had something to do with camp. There were 20 or 30 pages to fill out. There seemed to be a lot of trees around. I know I had 3 or 4 more dreams but they were all mixed up. (131 words)

Dreamt that we were in this old store and there were no elevators. There were old stairs, winding stairs to go to different levels in the store. All the floors were wood and the stairs were rickety and very very steep. I could feel the shakiness and hear them creaking. I knew if anyone fell it would be dangerous because the stairs were very onerous. I went down into what seemed like a sub basement, the railings were rough and loose, and there was a lady there who used to help us her name was V. She was with me in the dream, helping us as she always did. It seemed that we looked at a lot of clothes, a lot of different things. I'm thinking that it might have been an old Sears store, of yesteryear. Nothing looked new. The clothes were on these racks that felt wooden, everything was an old style store. And then we walked up and out and when we got up these winding stairs on the street level, the dream just faded away...I don't remember buying anything. It seemed we were there for a very long time. Mary was there and those ominous stairs. (200 words)

We were living in Hartford, and I dreamed that somehow I got shot in the arm. When I woke up, it took about 20 minutes to get over it, it seemed so real to me. I remember my left arm hurting and the hole that the bullet made in my left arm, on the side, near the shoulder.

The house was part of the house I live in now, because I remember the dining room table, sitting in the kitchen and I remember that suddenly the house changed and it was the house I had previously lived in and there was all kinds of stuff that was in that house that should have been in that house, but the floor and the walls, that I actually touched, were of the house where I am living in now. And I said that we'd have to remodel it to look like the other house and I remember actually starting to take the walls down. (170 words)

They were all friends that I had from when I lived back in West Boston where I haven't lived for 10 or 11 years. The mix of the people confused me and I was trying to figure out from them how they got out in the boat and how I got out in the boat and I actually remember touching the boat, and it was his boat, his aluminum boat but the weirdest thing was that there were all of these people around and we were catching fish.

And I could feel the chairs, some were made out of wood, some were metal folding chairs, some were plastic and the thing that bothered me was somebody told me the chairs didn't match. Their colors didn't match and some were made out of wood some made out of metal and plastic and I remember running around trying to find a matched bunch of chairs and while we were unloading them, that's when I woke up.

We were in this crowded room and it was very noisy and we were trying to find the door, trying to get out of there. There were a lot of people around, they were all, some were clapping, some were cheering and apparently it was at a concert. I must have dreamed about the concert because my son had been mentioning a couple of concerts in a row, and there was all this loud music and noise and I was trying to find the door and every wall that I came up to was just a wall and there was no door and I just kept going around in circles, around in circles and finally a security guard said "if you want to go out you have to climb out of the window." I remember trying to climb out of the window and I couldn't get out the window because the window was shut and I had to force the window open and I remember feeling the glass and the metal structure around the window. I finally got out and was walking down the road and I people were yelling and telling me I had to come back and because I paid for the tickets I would have to stay for the whole thing . It was really weird. Just as they were about to approach me, I woke up. (230 words)

A fairly real dream about the wedding, sort of a reenactment of the whole day that went on. We had a wedding in a church, it was not a big church but I can remember walking my daughter down the aisle and going to the ceremony and then we jumped to the reception which was outside in the back yard. I remember there was a wooden bridge in the back yard and I remember walking over the wooden bridge to go to a table to sit down and I remember cutting the cake and dancing with my daughter and I remember eating and all around me I could sense that it was a beautiful, sun shiny day and not too hot. I dreamed it exactly as it took place that day. It was very late by the time we left. It was a very realistic, vivid dream. (147 words)

I remember dreaming of some of the stuff that happened to me while I was in the hospital recently. I dreamed of the tubes that were down my throat for breathing. I remember the tubes vividly, I believe they were made out of plastic and I remember it being taped to the side of my face. I couldn't yell and I couldn't talk I couldn't really do anything. My left arm had a restraint strap on so I wouldn't pull the tube out. I also dreamed that they took the strap off and they left it off for about 2 days I guess and finally I did pull the tube out myself and the funny part was that they did leave the restraint off and as I awoke, I did pull the tube out. The dreams that I've had lately are mostly about my time in the hospital. (148 words)

I was going to the store to buy bread, and I went next door across the parking lot and I remember the sun, it was a hot, sunny day and the humidity was relatively high and when I got there, the door wouldn't open, it was stuck and I thought "oh well, they must be closed." I started to walk away and then someone opened the door from the inside and said "Oh no, we're open, come on in." So I went in and I couldn't find anything that was familiar to me, the whole place had been rearranged, there was hardware up front and I thought I must be in the wrong store but yet I could smell bread being made and I said to the guy, "Where's the bread being made?" And the man said "You're in a paint store." I started to leave and as I did someone came up and started to ring up their purchase and I could hear them say you have milk, eggs and 2 loaves of bread, and as I started to wake up I wondered how they were able to get bread when I couldn't.

There was nothing wrong with him, he was off riding some other rides and I could hear him at a distance but every time I caught up to him I couldn't find him, he wasn't there. It was pretty weird.

I dreamt of a job I had, years and years and years ago. I was working in a factory, making gears for printing press machines, which is what I did years ago. I can remember loading the machine, and these gears were made out of brass and I remember putting the gears on and these gears made a real mess because you didn't use oil on them to make them, they were just there to dry. I remember starting the machine and saying "something's wrong, the oil pump's not on." So I turned the oil pump on and what a mess that made! We had oil and brass chips all over the place and I remember having to get all the equipment out of there and having to clean it all up. Finally, as I began to wake up I remember thinking, wondering how did this bed get there, and because the window was open, how did all these sounds get there and it was pretty confusing for about 2 or 3 minutes.

I arrive home and note that I am driving a jeep, but it is the wrong jeep and so I drive back to a church and there a priest is standing next to my own jeep. (Priest a stranger). He says that he knew I had the wrong one, but that the owner of my jeep had already departed. He said that I was to bring both jeeps with me. I look for warm clothing since the jeep is open and it is now nighttime. I look in a garage and also see the priest there fastening rear and front bumpers of the two jeeps together, and I wonder how this is going to work. (115 words)

I am attending a business conference in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and walk out of meeting in a hotel and into a sort of large cafeteria where many people are eating in wide open space. The food table contains some sort of delicious looking apple cobbler mixture. I walk behind counter and start serving people as they come to table. The cook is seated near me--also behind serving table--and he is eating voraciously. I am nervous for fear the inviting apple mixture will be gone before I can get any. Later, in hotel lobby, I see Steve Andrews (fellow Manager in my office) get off elevator. I walk up and mention that I left the meeting to go home. Also tell him about the great apple mixture in the hotel restaurant. We stroll into a small waiting area and sit down. I am in a small, uncomfortable, old-fashioned brown chair close to ground, and Steve is in a normal and comfortable chair. I am squirming, trying to get in a good position and envying Steve his much better chair. (177 words)

I am in a large room with many people, some soldiers, all strangers, and am attempting to buy a painting from a soldier. Suddenly an officer shouts that he will shoot any soldier giving money to anyone. This sounds odd and I decide to leave, but first I give my calling card to soldier and promise to pay him later. In departing, I say, "I still want your painting." (69 words)

I am aboard a ship. The admiral is a disgusting, somewhat filthy old man who approaches me and I show him my teeth, partial dentures. Someone puts the teeth in the admiral's mouth and I say, "You have to have places empty between certain teeth so the plates will fit." But the teeth strangely enough fit his mouth and he looks a lot better. Later, still on the ship, I see him dressed as a woman. I am completely amazed, since I know it is the admiral, yet now he is thinner and beautiful. His wrists, I note, are thin and clean and his hair is quite stylish. In fact, he is the center of attraction among the passengers. I can't believe it is the same person. (127 words)

I am sitting at a table with several albums of stamps which I have taken out of the UN Postal Administration and from my safety deposit box. There is another guy at table (a stranger) and he too is looking thru his albums and talking aloud, His talking annoys me. And then as look thru my album, I am more annoyed at noting certain stamps are gone, others cut out from page. On the first pages I only noted some perforations bent and thought this was my carelessness in handling the book. Then seeing some gone and later see that these are all the most valuable, I am incensed. Rush home to phone Bob Max (Chief of UN Postal Admin.). I can't find phone book, but eventually get thru, and start to tell him what happened. He, however, is calm and not excited and this annoys me. We are cut off and then I hear children's voices on wire. I say, "Some damn brat cut us off!" Then I regret saying this because it was probably Max's kid and maybe they heard me. His wife comes on and tells me BOB IS NOT THERE, BUT AT THE UN. I am quite puzzled by this since I was talking to him. I then tell her that I am disgusted and will no longer collect stamps and will resign from all the clubs. (231 words)

Am aboard a ship or a land base as a sailor in the US Navy and am looking for a bunk or bed, while at the same time conversing with some other sailors (all strangers). We are all in white uniform.

I walk into a supermarket and am wearing women's flat shoes and aware of the noise they are making on the hard floor and it embarrasses me that this calls attention to me. I note several women standing nearby watching me and looking at my feet. A bit beyond them I continue shopping very busily and wonder if it would be best to just continue on and all the way around the store to the exit or return and go past these same women. Later have gone up some stairs and first person I see is one of the same women. (All strangers) (103 words)

Am on a 'round the world trip and visiting Australia, where a busload of us have stopped to play baseball. I am last in line to bat and when my turn comes, I suddenly note the bus has gone. Looked for some familiar faces, but only found the stewardess. I was furious at being left behind. Later am in a hotel and same girl (a stranger) is there and I ask her when next plane is due since mine had left and could I continue the tour on next plane. Am dissatisfied with answer and I tell her I am so disgusted I want to go back home. The hotel is big, but seems very junky. I walk around the grounds to kill time and see a guy wearing a sleeveless tunic and a floppy hat. Later see some guy in a hotel room (different man, both strangers) and I ask him where I can get a tunic. He replies that it is made of sheep, like the one he is wearing, which is slightly different, but has long strands of hair. We walk into another room and then I am in my own room and see in mirror that I am wearing earrings. Am astonished and then realize the guy probably saw them but said nothing. Room is very disorderly and I decide to write a nasty letter about this to Pan Am. I go to an office of my company and ask everyone for some paper. No one has any. One offers me a tiny slip of paper. Every piece I pick up from a desk has something printed on one side. I am thoroughly disgusted and storm out to another building looking for the head office where am sure there will be paper for the letter. I find a paper store in the street and also realize at the same time that all I have with me is US money. The thought also strikes me that I was stupid not to have asked for paper at the hotel where there would surely be some. (347 words)

Am at some international sporting event. Gen De Gaulle is there and I watch him playing ping pong and wonder what he is doing there. Walk around outside the stadium and note everything, house, very honky tonk. I enter one and see a French movie star sleeping and awaken him. Then I ask someone to recall his name for me. I wonder why De Gaulle has not congratulated him. Walk to a table where De Gaulle is drinking a glass with some colored liquid. He mutters something about it being only a colored soft drink and that there should be more acceptable stuff around. He also mentions that the French Red Cross has labs there. He is at a large table with several people planning to enter a billiard game or something similar. Few minutes later he is gone and someone says he left in a huff. Later I see a man and a woman waiting nervously at an elevator. The man resembles De Gaulle but he could also be just a double. I hear someone say he is not De Gaulle, but that the General is out sitting on a bench with a girl. (195 words)

Am waiting on tables in a large dining room where I seem to be only waiter. People are mostly all waiting for service, few eating; few with any dinnerware in front of them. I go to kitchen and no one is there and don't seem to see any dinnerware around. A couple enters dining room and I seat them and ask for their order. Couple is familiar to me, but can't recall their names. The man asks for a "gasket" for breakfast and says it is a sort of melon. This puzzles me. I return to kitchen and look for plates and cups for water. Finally see kitchen has an immense variety of shelves of all sizes, containing all kinds of dinnerware in disarray. I determine place needs organization and cleaning up. I prepare a tray with some cups of water for the couple and take to them. In placing down some spills and realize this is a fine way to start the service. Am also aware that people all around are getting impatient for service and that most of them arrived before the couple I am serving. (188 words)

Am on a tandem bike with someone in front of me, and ahead is a long, straight concrete road that I am not familiar with. It gets narrower as we continue and finally very narrow and rough with overhanging branches retarding progress. Then we see Jones Turnpike and I say, "Yes, I knew this was the right road." The rough road smoothes out and broadens and we are on the Turnpike and in familiar surroundings. (75 words)

I am wandering down a wooded field on a slope and see people painting. I listen as a woman tells the pupils painting that colors are alive and that each "has two or three sides."

Am walking down a street and pass a couple, middle-aged, woman dumpy and with red, fuzzy hair. Suddenly she leaves her partner and comes over and propositions me. I look at her and say that I would never believe she was that way. Later am sitting at a table with 3 or 4 persons eating. To my right is the same woman sitting, oddly enough, in what appears to be a row of movie seats. I whisper to the guy across from me so she cannot hear, that in case he didn't know it, that woman there was a "prostituée" and I spell it out after saying the word. (109 words)

I see some brown chickens running around the yard and decide to scoop one up and so do using a butterfly net. Finally get one and then I smash the net on the ground a few times to either kill or stun it. I stop and then see it is really a brown red fox and not a chicken. I empty the net and it falls on the ground, stunned. I grab a club and beat it unmercifully ... many blows. It seems to take much time and the fox appears to be looking at me and pleading for mercy. At one point its claw raises and seems to be staying my blow as it touches my arm. But eventually I beat it to death. (125 words)

Am walking down a street behind two boys and note that one on left has his hair rolled up on curlers at the bottom, below his cap. I think it strange for a boy to have such long hair. In striding past them, I glance quickly aside at his face and then note he is wearing a skirt and he is really a girl. Later I enter a house and two Scottish girls that I apparently know well are sitting in the kitchen at a table with their mother. They appear to be visiting and this is my house. A fourth woman is also in the kitchen and apparently she is my mother. They are all laughing. I ask if they are telling unclean stories. I then am glad as I shake hands with them, that I am wearing my favorite tartan tie. Then look down at it and note I don't have it on, but instead am wearing an orange turtle neck and no tie.

Am on a train or ship and asleep in a large leather chair. Awake and walk down an aisle which later seems like the aisle of an European style train and the train has stopped and people are walking along aisle to exit. Most are wearing winter furs. I realize I am naked, but wrapped in a fur auto robe. Look down and see I have on brown women's high heeled shoes. Am shocked at this and afraid that some passenger might notice as we all walk down aisle. (89 words)

Am in some foreign city and look up to see smoke coming from open windows of a house. Then see a strong stream of water shoot into windows and note it seems to come from a light brown pistol which doesn't seem attached to any pump. I marvel at the force of water from such a small pistol and watch as the stream goes thru window and plays up and down and at shelves and furniture. Also note there doesn't seem to be any fire in room. (87 words)

I am in some sort of institution or home for people with sex troubles. Looking in a mirror I note that the lacy upper part of a slip is partly seen in the V-neck of a black shirt I am wearing. Say to myself: "Why not, everyone knows I am supposed to be a man who wears women's clothes. So what!" Later I appear to be wearing a skirt with same black shirt and hear someone say that it is afternoon tea time. A woman with a large oven opens the door and I see little cakes inside. She says to be careful, they are hot. I take a brown one that appears to be gingerbread, but I wonder what is inside. While taking it on a paper doily, I note some chocolate balls about 1" in diameter on a nearby shelf and when the woman turns her back, I take some. Look for a table and all are full. But someone at a table invites me to sit down. I sit and feel good because I remembered to smooth my skirt properly. Later a woman from the institution, some sort of warder, takes 2 or 3 of us on a bus. I sit down alone at an aisle window, conscious of being dressed completely as a woman and with a neatly coiffed hairpiece. I look at arms in the sleeveless dress and observe they are too muscular looking. Some young boys enter the bus and apparently know the warder. They sit in back with her and are all laughing and joking. One is apparently sitting behind me and I feel a rake-like stick poke me under the rear and I jump with a slight protest. Then one of the young boys sits down alongside me. I see he carries a new, coiled bull whip. He turns to me and I note his shirt is open and I poke him away and off the seat with a small stick which I push against his chest. He leaves, saying, "I'll get you later." I hear someone else, one of the girls, jump in indignation and I guess someone has also poked her with the rake stick. Later we are in a bar. I see the warder and the boys and some other people sitting up to the bar. I walk past and sit down at an empty table in what I feel is ladylike fashion, smoothing my skirt. A boy approaches me with a mean look on his face and I begin to realize that the warder has set this whole thing up to allow myself and the other girls to fall into the hands of these bad boys ... and that the bus meeting was prearranged. I am afraid because I do not want to be touched by them or even worse, to be whipped and get hurt seriously. I get up and look for a toilet. Remember saying to someone that I had better use the men's room. Enter and note people staring at me. I enter an open booth, fumble thru dress, slip and corset and finally find my penis. I urinate standing over the bowl and immediately it fills up as my loud, strong and very yellow stream pours down. It flows onto the floor from a bidet which seems strangely connected to the toilet bowl. A janitor walks in and ignores me as he reaches up and pulls a chain. I walk out and adjust my dress.

Am in the recreation room of some shore resort hotel. Note a young couple seated with knees touching and supporting some sort of game board. I take a chair nearby and watch. On the board are numerous small objects, such as a pin, pencil, piece of chalk and object of game seems to be to place them like dominoes in some sort of order, either from most expensive to least expensive, or vice-versa I leave and walk outside. I see a hotel nearby which is shaped exactly like a large can placed on its side. It's some three or four stories high. I am afraid it might slip any minute and actually roll on down the beach and into the water. It occurs to me that only those lying in the sand sun bathing would be safe, providing that their position coincides with the large rectangular openings of the can-shaped hotel as it rolled over the sand, crushing people. Later I hear the hotel actually did roll down onto the beach. (171 words)

Am in Stockholm on business and decide to take a trolley car to a store with the name of Batlle. Conductor says fare is 50 cents and I ask him if he said 50 cents or 15 cents. He mumbles something that sounds like maybe 50 cents, but I decide he really means 15 cents. I put a nickel and a dime in the fare box. At Batlle the clerk shows me a solid-looking 35mm viewfinder type camera. Price is $31. I look at camera and tell him it appears to be just what I need for my daughter. He leaves and I examine camera, but the more I look at it, the less satisfactory it appears. There are bright blue and red labels and a roll of film with instruction sheet how to put in camera. But the sheet comes apart and case doesn't seem to fit. I assume it is a display camera and the clerk left to get me a better one. I wait a long time and he still doesn't return. (175 words)

While standing in doorway of my garage I note a squirrel has invaded the garden. Reach for my German slingshot and grab a pebble. The pebble seems more a stone, but I think it will probably just pass thru the uprights of the metal slingshot. I look for squirrel and it is now sitting in a bush. As I aim, one of the metal uprights slowly bends towards me. Astonished, I straighten it up with my right hand and again take aim. As I pull back the elastic, again the same metal bar slowly bends down. I look for the squirrel and he is gone. (105 words)

I am in a bus station and looking at a posted map of routes. A woman and a little girl are standing next to me. The girl opens her hand and it has a penny. I do the same and I also have a penny in my hand, but mine seems bigger than hers. I give it to her. Then her mother smiles and asks me what bus I am looking for. I tell her I want to go to Westwood or South City. She says those cities are not located where I am looking, which is in N.J., but rather are to the east of N.Y. and she points to where I thought Long Island was and it does say N.J. I am truly puzzled but I realize the map must be correct. (134 words)

I am in a house on a high and steep hillside and observing some animals, strange-looking beasts, all lurking around the base of a tree. Next morning I look out the window and down to the tree and it is gone. But I see another a short way off, but am sure that it is a new tree, one I didn't notice the evening before. I see a strange new bird fly away from it, but as it gets closer, I am disappointed to note it is a rather common species of butterfly. (93 words)

Then I feel I should be doing something more worthwhile with my time and remember there is an Alexander Calder exhibition at the edge of the city. Go there and see some 60 pieces of large sculpture standing against the walls of a chateau. I think to myself how nice it would be if my wife were there to see this tremendous exhibition. (84 words)

Am in a bed outdoors in a garden and the bed is at the corner where two eight-foot wide paths meet at a right angle. Before going to sleep I see some flowers alongside one of the paths and realize how pleasant it will be to see these again when I awaken. Then realize winter is coming and they will be gone. Awaken on a sunny morning and find I am wearing a black corsolette and I immediately start to unclasp it since it is clasped all the way down the front. I do this as I am lying on top of the bed and without blankets. Then see a girl strolling along quietly sniffing flowers. I quickly pull my knees up and close to stomach so she won't see what I am wearing. She passes and says, "Good Morning." I respond and she disappears down the other path. I relax and start again to unclasp when someone, a stranger, comes strolling from other direction. And I hear footsteps from the direction the girl came. Realize with all these people I'll never be able to get the corsolette off and out of bed. (193 words)

I have a new sports car and keep it in a garage where apparently I told the owner he could borrow it. Arrive at garage one morning and note the owner's mechanics are testing it with all kinds of modern equipment. I realize ruefully that he would probably never have done that for me, but is doing it since he intends to borrow it. However, I drive the car out and am heading toward a traffic light when two trucks roar by me, one on each side, and the one on the left cuts over in front of me. I am incensed at their beating me to the light and I wish they were not there. As I do so, they both start to roll backward to another traffic light and I arrive at the second light and am happy I am in front and they are back and waiting at the previous light. As I am waiting alone at the second light for it to change, all of a sudden the concrete highway under me begins to move backwards and under me like a treadmill and I say, "Oh! they're changing the road again," as though this was a normal everyday thing.

He calls to two men who were watching us and one steps forward and sits on bench under ladder to support it. (93 words)

A German officer is walking toward me and for some reason I don't want him to see me, and I crouch down in a large armchair so my head doesn't show. Then he sees me and shouts something. I realize I am wearing pajamas and a blue bathrobe and he must have spotted me quickly. I follow him and my feet, which are bare, hurt from walking on the stones. We enter a building. He disappears and I see a man looking at a picture of clouds. The drawing also shows some of the buildings on New York City's 53rd St. and I walk up to him and tell him that the street is 53rd. He nods and smiles and says nothing, and I realize he probably only speaks German. (130 words)

I am a spy and have crossed the German lines and made contact with a German soldier. He invites me to conceal myself in the bushes where I find a row set up of movie seats in violet color. We sit in the seats and both look up at a large mountain not too far away. He says, "See all those French soldiers up there." I can see hundreds of them in the distance silhouetted against the sky. They look like ants and as numerous. I think to myself how easily someone could pick them off with a high powered rifle. (101 words)

Others also are in the water swimming toward the boat. She continues to swim fairly strongly and eventually is out of sight and I know she has reached the boat. (87 words)

I am driving alone along a parkway trying to locate a certain intersection. Several cars are in right lane, but I manage to edge in as we approach an intersection. I keep looking for large signs describing the intersection and see nothing, only small street-type signs which I cannot read. I am annoyed and drive past intersection in disgust. Later I stop while driving on a long, narrow street and ask a man for the route to Panama. He has a shopping cart of groceries and says he'll show me the way if I take him and his cart. I have a small green car and open the trunk, but it is full of packages. We think about putting the cart and contents through a door, but do not actually do it. Later am in a small restaurant in which I think is Mexico. A small boy is with me as a guide. He has gone to eat, sitting at another table with friends, while I eat alone. I finish and am impatient for him to complete his meal so we can leave. He finishes, but then leans back to relax and chat. I realize that this Latin relaxing is not for me and decide to get up and walk out and surely he will then follow me. Then realize as I reach the outside that I don't have the car keys and have left them in my shirt pocket. Rush back into restaurant and find shirt on back of a chair and am relieved to find keys haven't been stolen. Later am at home and packing for a trip to Latin America. I intend to drive there and just continue on and on with no definite destination, but just to drive along and enjoy the sight. Take a khaki blanket from a closet in case have to sleep in car. Also pick up a pair of rubbers in case of tropical rains. I think about supper and note time is 3:15 and decide I must be on my way by 3:30. Then I realize I cannot really go on the trip and leave my two daughters alone since they are still going to school. They need me and I must abandon the trip. Also am aware that Nancy is 20 and Katie is 6 and that the former should be able to carry on in my absence. But I still decide to cancel the trip. (406 words)

I am in a hotel where I am supposed to dance in the female impersonator show. Am dressed in full women's underclothes, but no dress, and am wondering why no one has given me a fancy gown for the revue. Someone hands me some material and at first it appears to be just folded remnant of cloth of a greenish gold color, but attractive, with a small print design. As I unfold it, I see it has short sleeves and is long, but needs ironing or pressing. I go to a hotel room where I know there are two irons. As I walk in, notice someone is using the smaller of the two and ironing on a blanket on a table. I turn to the other side of room where I know there is a normal ironing board, but then see someone also using that. I am impatient to get dressed and eventually am wearing the dress and realize that the show is starting. I look at wrist watch and time is 10:25 pm and know show starts at 10:30. I am in a panic. This is my first show and I must be on time. But my face is not made up and I know it takes much time to apply theatrical makeup properly. I ask someone to get my little white box with makeup. Later I am in an elevator, still dressed but without makeup, and people are looking at me strangely. I think surely they must realize I am in the impersonator revue. (256 words)

Am driving a busload of people who have paid for a tourist travel trip to a southern state. We arrive at the state line where I am stopped for a traffic light. Also realize that I am not familiar with the traffic regulations of that state. I look up at light and there are no colors, then look again and it is green. We continue down the road and then later someone else, a young man in dark purple shirt and matching trousers, is driving us, but the front of the bus inside seems more like a trolley car and he is manipulating the lever as we continue along. He drives up and down the hills and I note they are getting steeper and steeper. Finally in desperation he turns to me as we climb a hill and says he is using all the speed he can get and that we are just about able to make the hill. If they get worse, we won't make it. Ahead I see several grades, but they are small. We reach a plateau and in the distance to the left of the road we see some majestic mountains in the distance. They are misty and the sky is blue and the sun is strong. I realize the rugged mountains are the Rockies and also that I didn't know this southern state was so far to the West. We continue and finally the road ahead narrows until there is only one lane. Our vehicle fills the whole road. Ahead I see that the road swerves, has dangerous turns and then finally unbelievably, it actually turns on its side perpendicular. When I see that, I am furious because the state trooper had not warned us that the road was so bad. I realize we will have to go back and that the tourists will get a refund. I wait at the side of the road as the man in purple shirt walks ahead to see how the road looks. Then a sports car comes by and roars ahead and sweeps around the perpendicular road and is gone.

Am in France and going someplace with George Mohr. We approach two curved lines of yellow taxis. One contains normal sized cabs; the others are mostly small station wagon type of delivery cars, typical to the kind used in Paris. George heads toward the smaller cabs and I try to say something to him about using the larger, more comfortable ones. The driver of the first small yellow cab nods as we approach and I decide I don't like his looks. Then George says that we forgot to tell the kids we were leaving and abruptly we turn toward the left to a few buildings like camp recreation buildings. George calls to the young people who can be seen playing in the large building. He calls in English and I then say something in French and immediately they all come out. One small girl runs to me and throws her arms around my legs and clings to me. George continues talking to them in French. (165 words)

Am in some strange small town in the mountains and as I look up, I see someone skiing down a long and narrow run on a hill far away. I am with someone, but cannot recall his or her face. We start walking up toward the ski area which seems far away, but we finally reach an open square or plaza covered with a few inches only of snow. Just then a skier, a young boy, comes across the square fairly fast, heading for the corner where there is a sharp right angle turn which then leads down a narrow ski run. He doesn't make the turn successfully and crashes into the fence. Not too hard; gets up and shakes off the snow. I note he is using old wooden skis and wonder whether I would risk my own metal Hart skis on such a dangerous turn and on snow that is not packed. (154 words)

I am driving someplace and looking for a certain road. I see one at the left with a house on the corner. Am not certain it is really a road or just someone's driveway, although it is rather wide for a driveway. It is black asphalted and I stop the car just after the turn, undecided whether to go ahead or not. The road disappears into the trees and a short distance ahead a man is standing square in the middle of the road and looking ahead at me. I sit in the car and wait and he stands and watches. No action. Finally he moves a few steps aside and I drive ahead. As I pass him, note he is middle-aged, heavy-set. I drive on and on and finally into an open area. To the left the view is magnificent of a bridge in the distance and a bright blue harbor. Later I am on a boat in that harbor steering it thru the water and appear to be very high up in the boat. Have a good view of rocks and shoals as the boat is steered by me along the coastline for some distance. The water is a deep, rich and clear blue and I remark on how much fun it is to steer the boat so easily thru the water. (224 words)

President Lyndon Johnson made a speech on TV and apparently I must have missed his talk. Someone has asked me to get a lot of copies. I ask a store and their price is $89 for 12 copies and I cannot calculate the per speech price and this annoys me. I wonder why they cannot arrange to have the fire bells or horns ring for a few minutes with some special signal that would alert the public to the fact that the Pres. is going on TV. (87 words)

I have moved into an apartment on the top floor of a building in some large city, As I walk into the apartment I hear much noise from the next apartment and note that there is a glass pane door separating my apartment from the adjacent. Most panes of the window are covered with brown paper, but here and there it is torn and I can see a family next door sitting at the dinner table and eating and conversing noisily. I note two little girls in dark green dresses and with light brown hair eating in the seats right next to the glass door, where the table is located. I am annoyed at this noise and lack of privacy and immediately start to place pieces of brown sticking paper on the open spots on the door. After this I look out of window at other side of room, which gives a splendid view out over a very large city. In order to see directly down, I remove the screen, which is an old-fashioned type held on with two flanges at the top. The screen slips off the flanges and I hold it tightly and try to get it back on the hooks ... without falling out the window. Slowly and carefully I get it back on and then close and lock it. Later walk downstairs and in lobby of apartment house see some Chinese people and I feel friendly with them. I see a man who is the janitor and owner and with him is his Chinese wife. I offer to help him sweep a huge red tiled lobby area and I tell him that my wife also is Chinese. All three of us - janitor, his Chinese wife and I - sweep a section of the floor with straw brooms. It occurs to me that he really needs some large foxtail push brooms in order to do a more thorough job, and thus make less dust. (328 words)

Am in a business office where another chap and I are helping the former occupant to move out his stuff. Apparently I am to be the new occupant. One side of office contains many walnut shelves and drawers and we are looking thru them as the former occupant stands aside and observes. We check shelves to see if everything is packed. While reaching into deep lower shelves near floor, I find a stack of papers and without bringing them entirely out into open, I bend down and examine them. They appear to be personal letters on pink paper and while shuffling thru them, I see a $1 bill. I then slip out the stack and surreptitiously place them in the back of a drawer where I know no one will find them so that I can later examine them in detail when I am the sole occupant in office. I do this switch of location quickly and former occupant doesn't see anything. While checking other drawers, we find two long, slender and very shallow drawers near the bottom of the drawer section. At first they look like part of the structure and not drawers. But we manage to pull them out, the other man and I (not the former occupant) and we see they contain art supplies, ink and brushes, tubes of paint, all of which probably date back to some other former occupant of that office of some years ago. Apparently he had forgotten them. (246 words)

Am in a rented car and stop in a city street and park. Walk past an open store and see piles of cartons containing junk apparently and I walk in and start rummaging thru. Find old clothes and papers and at the same time a woman is looking thru the same carton. We speak in Spanish. I then note at the other side of room a meeting of men from my office. This is a meeting which I had declined to attend, saying I was much too busy. They look at me and wonder what I am doing there with the cartons. I walk past them, saying nothing, and look at my watch as though I was late for something. It says 10 pm, almost, and I reach for a phone to call home. Find the phone, but the receiver is at the end of a long wire and hidden behind some other cartons. I go into another office and it apparently belongs to a church. There are women and children in the room waiting for a minister. I don't phone, but walk out to car which I find parked off the street and on an asphalted lot. I swing into traffic just as light changes, cutting off other cars and manage to get to my lane and speed off. (220 words)

I am driving my blue MG down a street in St. Petersburg, Fla. Someone has said there is a job open at Sears and I am trying to get there. Ahead of me are some soldiers marching and I put on the brakes, but slip toward them and actually bump slightly several men in the back rank. But they don't seem to mind and just turn and look at me slightly. Then I drive on and we all reach a cross street at the same time and must wait. For some reason I am squatting alongside the front rank and looking ahead and then I drop a handful of dust alongside a soldier and it gets into his eye. I quickly apologize and get in car and drive on. (129 words)

I am walking down a New York City street. Day is sunny and hot. Have to wait for traffic at a cross street and a taxi crosses in front of me. It is yellow and has its door on driver's side all the way open and bent forward and tied down. This leaves the driver fully exposed. He is about 45, thin and disheveled and looks at me with a bored expression as he drives in front. The door, unfortunately, extends out in front of cab and thus is quite dangerous. This annoys me and I want to shout something at the driver. But I don't and I continue walking down the street. (113 words)

I am talking with someone, a stranger, about the difficulties of driving on the ocean bottom compared to driving on land. I remind him, as though I were speaking from experience, that this is not easy. Surface is rough and bumpy and one is not always able to see far ahead. I tell him it is always murky down there and a driver cannot go at all fast. (68 words)

I walk into a washroom in the basement of a large building. The floor is covered with soap foam and it is piled like snow in a sink. I wash my hands in empty sink and when I press automatic soap plunger, a hissing stream of soap foam shoots out and dowses my suit. I move aside, but clothes are covered with foam, which I try to wipe off as two plumbers walk in. I tell them about defective soap plunger. They walk over and try and again it shoots a stream out about ten feet long right across the room. I jump aside. (104 words)

Am sitting on a curb in front of my car. A man approaches walking softly alongside car. He stops in front of me and I look up and realize he is threatening me with hand in jacket pocket which appears to hold a gun. I then realize I have seen him before and with another man. As I realize this, I stand up and am immediately aware of that other man now standing behind me, also threatening with hand in pocket. I walk away and then they follow closely behind. I turn quickly and grab both their pockets, one with each hand and twist them away so they cannot shoot at me. (112 words)

I am leaving a building, walking towards the door; it seems to be some sort of school. See an envelope on a table near door and it seems to have stamps inside, so I pick up to examine. A stamp collector I know, Gus, walks over and takes it from me. He pulls out stamps and they are all good items. He walks away with the envelope, saying it was his and he had lost it. Walking out double glass doors, I see on steps some UN stamps laid out on a black paper. All are used and sloppily mounted. I stop and pick up the only possible item of valuable content, a special UN souvenir sheet. It looks okay, but when I turn it over, it has tiny round perforations on back forming small stamp-like rectangles. All of which ruins its value. (143 words)

A man is riding around in a red Thunderbird, apparently looking for an enemy who lives in New York City. He has the address written down on a piece of paper. With him is a little girl and he is anxious for her safety. It is nighttime. He stops near a house and places her in a crate standing up high near a window and hidden. On other side of window one can see another little girl sleeping. She is about same age and sleeps on her back and is wearing a false nose. The man drives away and tries to remember the address. He takes long knife from seat and places in pocket and also puts a long bayonet-like tool in his belt. Then fishes out piece of paper and looks at address. Sees that it is East and he is heading in wrong direction. He turns into an apartment-hotel driveway and turns around, heading East. Next the two girls are seen inside the house, the one who was sleeping leading the other thru the rooms. (177 words)

Am in some sort of hospital or prison and sitting at window looking out. A nurse says the coffee cart is there and she goes for a cup of coffee. Later I am drinking it at window and the cart nurse walks in. I say, "I don't hear your bell way back here." She goes to a nearby bulletin board as another nurse, heavy and severe, approaches and says roughly, "Drink your coffee!" I ignore her and continue talking to the one at the board, repeating what I said earlier just to annoy the bossy nurse. I also add that next time I would like her to bring me a piece of chocolate cake and an orange. (117 words)

Have answered a test in a magazine on recognizing religious subjects, art and design. The magazine invites participants to an evening meeting. I decide to go to design group and when arrive and sit down, realize with disappointment I am in the religious subject group. I must have made a mistake, and then decide to stay until they serve coffee. I am sitting partially behind woman whose hair is neatly wrapped in a chignon of braids in the back. The hair is dark brown and as I admire its beauty, she gets up and turns to leave, and I realize with disappointment her hair in front is short and blonde and stringy. I look at her carefully to be sure she is same person. Later am in art group and as arrive there to sit down, I realize am still wearing my hat. I nonchalantly take it off and toss onto top of coat rack nearby. It rolls across other hats and falls on floor. I pick up and place on table near my seat. We are then asked to go to tables in back of room. I find myself sitting next to an old man. I want to ask him why we are at the tables. But as look at him, realize he has a rather stupid face and I get up from my seat. At another table is a slide projector and I see a slide in it of a black and orange drawing. In front of machine is a questionnaire with five questions on it. The slide flashes on a screen and I realize I am expected to fill out questionnaire. (274 words)

Three of us, two men and myself, are sitting in a library. Guy on my left is eating chocolate-covered Nabisco wafers. He goes to a shelf and puts one down, with a look at the third man, sitting to my right and across. I immediately get up and walk over to shelf where he put the wafer and I eat a mouthful with a look of assurance at the third man. I smile assuredness that I will leave some for him. I munch less than half the wafer and then walk over and hand the remaining morsel to him. (99 words)

I enter the exit door of a red brick grammar school and sit on the hall steps. See a small child's penknife on step and pick it up and then cannot decide whether to leave or walk thru the school. I hesitate, but don't want to be found sitting on steps, so get up and walk down the corridor. In an open area I see 10-12 women sitting on chairs waiting. As I reach them, one looks up at my hair and then I realize with a shock that I have clips and pins in my hair and am wearing a bouffant night cap. Walk quickly to a dim area of corridor and quickly remove the items. I walk into a library area where there is an exhibit of work by children. One is on the subject of trees and I sit down to admire it. A woman, probably a teacher, walks over and hands me a notice about the exhibit and assumes I want to meet the child responsible. I say Yes and he comes over and I tell him that I had heard about him from his mother who comes to the school each day to look at his empty desk where he used to be. We both agree this is absurd. I look at each tree exhibit and they are well executed. Some are carvings, some show age of trees from slices, and I enjoy exhibit and keep saying it is very well made. (247 words)

I am with someone, not a stranger, but apparently someone with whom I work, and we are standing in the street at night and looking at up a new, large office building. it is immense and has maybe fifty windows along one side of a floor. Only a few lights show, and here and there one sees a secretary working. I distinctly note one blonde with a reddish blouse at a brightly lit window, typing. Someone makes a remark about the girls having always to work late, although the boss has gone home. Later I am in a suite of offices apparently soon to be occupied by my own firm. Most of the floors are still empty of furniture. I am standing in a shadow next to a closet inside one of the offices and am dressed in a blue seersucker skirt and jacket. The main door down the hall opens and in comes a firm official and with a guy I know. They walk away and I am relieved ... but then the guy turns and says he wants to see what his new office looks like. I then realize as he heads towards my direction that maybe I am in that office. I quickly tear down the skirt and fumble for my trousers. Then his steps pass the office and I realize that he won't see me. He and his boss are also wearing seersucker men's summer suits of same bluish color as my women's suit. (248 words)

I climb aboard a bus, a long luxurious travel cruiser, and look for the most comfortable seat. Find one with a long space in front for legs and I flop down. No one else seems to be coming aboard. I then hear a noise and note we are parked near a railroad track and a train--a long freight train of yellow fruit cars--is coming around the curve of tracks and the curve is so arched that the bus can be hit. Then it is jarred by the roaring train and the upper outside corner near track is smashed by train. But this doesn't bother me. I remain comfortably seated and waiting as damaged bus remains in position. (117 words)

I am approaching the door of our house ... although it seems a strangely short front door -- and I see a rodent dash inside the partially ajar opening. I dash after and am sure I can see him inside up and close to the ceiling. I run up steps and look back at sill above door. There is a squirrel crouched in fear. I look for a tool to kill him, and pick a ½" diameter steel bar with a point, sort of a star chisel. I jump for him and he lands on landing near front door (inside door), where I manage to pin him down with point of tool. But he twists head up to bite and I move away. Door opens and my daughter Nancy is looking out to see what goes on. I yell, "Stupid!" but the squirrel grabs the opportunity and runs inside where my wife is setting the table in dining room. Squirrel lands on a chair and crouches there -- a small, thin pathetic thing. (Dream ends abruptly.) (176 words)

I am somewhere in Florida in a gulf city and trying to reach the beach. Looking at a map, I see that most roads lead toward the water, but that only one or two actually pass over causeways directly to water. Next am in a small boat in one of the bays between the beach keys and the mainland. I drop a flat, yellow plastic box in the water by accident and it sinks. Then boat suddenly touches bottom. A shark flashes by and then turns back and heads for boat. To say the least, I am frightened because boat seems stuck. (102 words)

Am in a stamp store waiting in a line of about six people to buy stamps. Appears to be a confused double line and next to me is a small and abnormally fat man, looking extremely uncomfortable. A man standing roughly in front of me appears to be a friend of fat man. The fat one gets annoyed with someone standing behind him and he then passes in front of me and stands with his friend. I feel sorry for the little guy. Later I have only one person in front of me, as a stranger walks in and stands close to front of line, near me, waiting to cut in when merchant and first man are through. This annoys me and I follow the transaction closely so I can cut in and command merchant's attention before stranger cuts in. (140 words)

I decide to edit these mistakes, but the light is poor. Walk around looking into rooms and enter one filled with men at desks, all in business suits. A man tells me to go to room #3, but I don't hear him right away. Finally it registers and I say "Sorry!" and go to that room. A man there wants to discuss my qualifications to obtain a scholarship and I start to tell him I didn't come there for that. (113 words)

I go upstairs in our house to look for something in daughter Katie's room. She sleeps in a small bed similar to one she had as a little girl. In another bed, lying on top and fully clothed with head propped on a pillow and sleeping, is a hippie type of about 25, with reddish blond hair, large and fuzzy. I close her closet door and it squeaks. She awakens and smiles at me and I tell her that breakfast is ready, but with a glance at hippie, whisper that there is not much to eat. (96 words)

Some sort of show for children is taking place in our house. I am astonished at so many children in attendance. A crippled boy with one arm is in a basket suspended from the ceiling by an adjustable rope. With his good arm and the stump of the missing arm he skillfully controls the rope and swings back and forth, up and down, over his applauding audience of children. He is marvelous to watch. I leave and go down a sort of hatchway to floor below, using a ladder attached to wall. Some rungs break under my weight. I slip down easily to next rungs and test them with my weight. They seem weak, so I force them and they also break as I land lightly on floor. I then stand aside with regrets at the broken rungs, thinking how difficult it will be for children, especially the cripple, to get down the useless ladder. (155 words)

Center of floor is piled high with used, old, damaged items, such as furniture, all property apparently of a former occupant. I suggest to a woman that she clean it up and give her a hand. I pick up a small toy, like a child's tank on treads and wind it up and set it on floor where it chugs away towards a man sitting on a carpet. I see two guitars, both broken and useless, but I hand them to some people laughingly telling them to go ahead and play a song. (108 words)

I was in a basement area of the UN Secretariat Building in NYC and looking for the office of the Postal Administration Chief, Tom Dements. Floor looked strange. When reached what I thought was his end of floor, I saw an office that looked like his with door ajar. Saw a girl, possibly his secretary, taking dictation. Looking closer, I saw she was only reading a newspaper and then I realized it was wrong office. Walking farther, I saw #330 on a room and realized this was the third sub-basement and I wanted the second. Kept looking for stairs to ascend to second. Opened a door thinking it led up, but it was a closet or small niche and contained all sorts of electrical equipment hanging on wall. Finally found the stairs at end of hall and with great relief climbed up. (142 words)

A long fence runs between the tracks and I realize that I really wanted the train, but that I am on wrong side of fence and cannot get back to train side. I go to the subway station and buy a New York Times. Price is only 5 cents and I wonder why still the old price of years ago. At station I show a letter with an address (have trouble opening the letter) to the change clerk. I get on, but am not sure I am still going in the right direction. (106 words)

Most all are wearing slacks or shorts, but I have a skirt. Then each goes out in her own small sailboat to practice. Alone in my own boat and moving along, and now I realize that at this distance -- and especially with a skirt on -- no one would possibly suspect I am a boy. (101 words)

Approaching an escalator, I see a woman getting on and I rush over to pull her off, shouting, "She's a Russian!"

Have arrived at home after an absence of apparently several days on a trip. Hear my wife talking to a woman in another room. Quietly go into bathroom and sit down to defecate. Then flush and realize with horror the water is rising in bowl. It rises fast and then spills over and the floor is covered with yellow urine and water. I decide I must clean up before the wife hears me, and look around for a sponge to soak up and rinse into basin. Then I see a long, probably 14-inch turd, mine, on the floor near the bowl. I realize I must actually pick it up with both hands somehow and get it back into toilet. I also realize if I touch it, I will ejaculate! (129 words)

Am in a large power boat in the South Atlantic. Water is bright green and weather is pleasant and warm. Many people in boat when all of a sudden it accelerates fast and a man standing in the stern, a friend of mine, falls overboard and disappears beneath the surface. I fear for his safety as someone cries out to beware of sharks. I leap to the stern and then see the black fin of a shark speeding fast toward the boat's stern. Then the fin goes below the surface and I distinctly see the shark flash below deep in the clear water. I am greatly frightened for my friend and I hope he has been able to beat off the shark. Then I look straight up to the sky and realize with chagrin that I haven't prayed for him. I cry aloud to God to save my friend and then look down in water. Surface is crowded with bits of seaweed and debris, but I see no evidence of my friend. He doesn't reappear. (175 words)

I ask clerk for two 20-lb sacks of flour. He loads them on a shopping cart and I note one is leaking badly. He says it is only a small leak and I protest that it is a large leak, and I hold up the one bag which by now is only 1/4th full. He gives me another full bag and I walk towards exit. There is a can of coke in the cart and I am now eating an ice cream cone. Decide to drink the coke and exit from food area with one hand holding the coke can and cone as I swig from a straw, while other hand pulls the cart. (148 words)

I have arrived in Paris again, apparently by boat, and am in the Gare St. Lazare or something similar where Le Havre trains arrive. I decide to pick up suitcase later and walk to a nearby stamp store to see what they have. It is a store that I have visited before. Exiting from station I note time is 8:45 a.m., but that the weather is foul, dark and murky and uninviting. I think it odd that it should resemble more closely 5:00 a.m. weather. Return to station and get case and then walk to where I have a car waiting, parked opposite station. Astonished to see my car full of people, sort of dark working class types. I place case in with them and find a spot to sit crammed in rear. A cop taps at window and I lower to see what he wants. Asks how come car parked there and I say it was only for a minute while I got my case and that I had brought the car over with me. He seems astonished that I would bring a car with me. (Car is a small blue Renault.) The guy at wheel drives away and when he turns right instead of left, I realize we will not pass the stamp store. I shout to stop and "get out of my car!" They continue and ignore me. A few feet later we slow down because many people and some cops are crowded on street. I open window and shout "Stop!" and bang my hand on side of car. Car stops as a few police walk over. (Prior to this as we drove away from station I looked around at all other parked cars, thinking I may have actually gotten into wrong car, but I see no other that resembles mine.) I am so annoyed as the cops approach, I cannot think to speak French and keep shouting "STOP!" Next we are all in police station and asked to produce registrations. I do and a cop puts into an open, used envelope and does same for the workers' registration and then walks away into another room. The workers, four or five men, a woman and a small child, sit down and wait patiently. I walk up and down, annoyed at all the waste of time, and keep looking at them. They don't seem to bear any malice toward me and I think this odd. A long time passes and the cops don't take any action, and I am worried that maybe I did take the wrong car. But nothing happens and I continue getting more impatient. (439 words)

Am in bed in a large room with light brown parquet floor. Room seems empty except for the bed. I turn on stomach and look down at floor, and see a large caterpillar crawling by and then a cockroach, plus some other odds and ends of bugs on the parquet. I reach under bed and grab a shoe. It is a woman's shoe and I use the sole to slap down and smash the bugs, one after the other. I turn to other side of bed and there are more. These I also kill. Then I find a pile of women's clothes, probably were under the bed. I get out and sort them on top of bed and note they are of large size, probably would fit me. One is a light blue skirt, size 18 on tag, and the blue wool material seems to have been cut short to make a mini skirt and done in a rough manner with a pair of scissors. While I examine the clothes and feel happy to have found some things I can use, the door springs open and 5 or 6 men come in. They shout for me to get ready; it is time to leave. They apparently are friends, but I hurriedly jump in bed and pull up the bedclothes, since I realize I am wearing a pink nightgown with a white lace collar and it would embarrass me to have them see me. They all leave except for one, and I tell him about the bugs which he sees smashed on the floor near my bed. Then I see a huge caterpillar on the door at end of room and shout for him to kill it. As he goes to door to do that, I use the opportunity to slip the gown over my head and stuff it under the bedclothes along with the other women's clothes I had found, thinking I will come back later for them.

Am with some woman who I apparently know and we are walking to someone's apartment. Arriving there, we pass thru the garden and I note with pleasure the many tall seedlings in boxes and think I may see if I can get some for my house. We climb stairs and a man approaches. I ask for the apartment of Mr. Weiss. He nods consent and opens the door of a nearby apartment. As we walk in, the woman with me giggles and I look at her with distaste. Her profile is strange and I realize she is a stranger. The man who opened door seems to be a janitor or attendant of some sort, but he goes behind a counter and brings out some stamps for sale. Says he will find a nice set of the series I am looking for. I wait and then note he is completely wrong and the 4 or 5 stamps he has placed on the counter are completely different from anything I want and I have a suspicion he knows nothing about the stamps. Meanwhile, 5 or 6 homemakers and their children are standing near doorway and I note they are rather good-looking in an interesting way, and I have a strong desire to walk over and talk with them instead of having to explain to the janitor how wrong he is about the stamps. I am sure he will not understand and a hassle will develop. (243 words)

I walk out of a bar in some foreign city and find my small car half buried in snow. Curiously enough, no snow on top of car, but the vehicle sits in about two feet of snow. I open door and seats are covered with slight layer. This I brush away and then start to rock and push car to get it out of slush and snow, and into the street. This is very difficult, but as it slides into street, other cars are blocked and they sit and wait. Car won't start, so I lift hood. I then slip down on ice and in struggling to get up, see that my trouser knees are soiled from slush. This annoys me and I note with additional annoyance that several dozen cars are all blocked on account of mine. (138 words)

Am in a hospital ward where people are all taking some sort of medicine and most objecting to it. A nurse hands me a glass some 2/3rds full of a watery, bluish liquid like weak milk. I am sort of sitting on very edge of bed and as I put my head back to raise glass and drink, I slip off bed to a standing position. Am aware that one is not permitted to leave bed or touch the floor and I pop quickly back on bed and start drinking again. But I slip again and still haven't tasted the medicine. (101 words)

I enter a bar with a baby who appears to be my granddaughter. A baby high chair with sawed off legs is on the bar surface and I place her in it. Somehow I have a feeling she is my daughter and I her mother. Someone brings dried kidneys and crumbles them in her soup (someone else had previously brought her the soup and she started eating it right away and I was pleased). I protest as this second stranger puts the kidneys in the soup, thinking that now she will not finish the soup ... but she continues to eat and again I feel relieved and pleased. (108 words)

I awaken and look out window and note I forgot to put out garbage cans the evening before. Note that trash baskets of neighbor on left are empty, but here and there across the street I note that a can or basket remains full while others are empty. I cannot tell whether garbage men have passed by yet or not and this is annoying. Then I see 3 or 4 full cans sitting on my driveway and remember that I promised the neighbor on the right that I would put them out during their absence. I think about putting them out even now, but am not sure whether it is too late or not. (114 words)

Am sitting at home looking at TV when doorbell rings. I don't want to answer. I hear someone outside and see a head raise up to peek in the curtain. I ignore it and lean back with hand over eyes as if sleeping, but continue to watch TV thru closed (partially) eyes. Later hear nothing and get up to look out curtain. See a small woman of Latin origin standing at door with small boy. He looks up and sees me peeking out and then quickly pulls sleeve of woman. (90 words)

Am walking down a street with Carl Rider, Editor of a newspaper, and suddenly he puts his hand on my fly. I protest, telling him that they arrest you for that in this city. I relate story of a man who fell down in street and of a chap who walked over and knelt down to help the man up ... and was then arrested by the police. Carl and I stop at a magazine stand and we look at some maps. Later am in my house talking with HH, a well-known stamp dealer, who notices a large calendar on my desk with the number "024" on it. I blush because I realize it is the one I took during a visit to Rider's office. I tell HH it is a duplicate of one in my own office. (138 words)

Am looking for a barrack and keep trying to remember where it is since I am sure I was there once before. Some places look familiar; others don't, and I find myself on a street completely unfamiliar. Go in a police station and there a boy with a map directs me. I leave, but still am not sure I am going in the right direction. (90 words)

Am walking in the corridors of a hospital looking for the exit. Keep trying doors to see if they lead to steps down. No luck. All the walls are newly painted and are a shiny enameled white. There are no direction signs and no numbers or anything on any doors or walls ... just the bright white paint. I wonder why Fire Exit not seen and realize this probably painted over also and this carelessness disturbs me. Now and then pass an alcove and there see a patient or two lying on mattresses on floor and talking to visitors. At end of a long corridor, I am confronted by three or four doors. Open one slightly and see a patient inside and realize there is no exit here. Finally pass an administrative office with cashier's window in wall. A nurse directs me out. (143 words)

I am walking in front of the UN building in NYC and over the inside walkway are three huge billowing balloon-like canvas awnings. They are high and bright red and orange, and I marvel how well they protect the pedestrian and add to the staidness of the UN. I walk into the Delegates' entrance and suddenly realize I am wearing a red and white vertically striped turban-like hat. It is a rather startling item and people all stare. I rather enjoy the attention and feel the hat compliments my new dark cashmere coat. (93 words)

Am walking along an apartment house basement corridor to a room known as the "Doll Room." I have a doll with me and when I reach the room, a woman opens door and lets me in. Walls covered with shelves, all containing dolls. She asks if I have a stand to hold the doll in an upright position. I say no and then leave. Following day am riding a large tri-cycle bike in front of house and pedaling along down a two-foot wide curb on a retaining wall that curves around the apartment house. As wall gets higher and driveway alongside deepens, I stop the bike and jump down from the wall and walk into the same basement corridor as the day before. Go to the doll room, but things have changed and now the door has a number on it like a suite of rooms or an apartment. Also the door alongside has a number. Room I thought was the doll room has a light shining under door. I decide to try the second room, and as I go to knock, the door flings open and the woman standing there seems to know what I want. She points to adjacent door and without saying a word, then closes her door and I remain in corridor still not sure I am in right place. (224 words)

Am standing across the street from the RR station in a group of people I apparently know. We are all observing the passersby on their way to the station, from where they catch the train for the beach. Every few minutes I see someone I know in the crowd going to the station. Finally I count out " ... 10, 11, 12 .... that makes 12 guys I know from our crowd. Guess it's time for me to go to the beach." But I head away from the station and say to someone that I have to change my good trousers to khaki ones before I can go. Strolling up the street, I feel unusually good and strong and healthy and I stretch my arms out to the side and then overhead and exercise as I walk along, now and then swinging my arms. Then I see a girl in a store window rearranging some dummies and I feel sorry that she must work while everyone goes to the beach. (170 words)

Am in a large barn-like structure on the estate of my firm's boss. There are many employees there and we all awaken early for a sort of picnic breakfast to which the boss has invited us and arranged for everything to be prepared. He walks in with his wife and several family members. The women are fashionably dressed, really overdressed and overly made up, and I look at them and suspect they would have all preferred to remain in bed, but that the boss forced them to come.

Am in Florida in a large souvenir store and looking over the toiletries counter. A small tray of perfumes is getting all my attention and I also look at some perfumed soap and bath powders. Then I take a small bottle of something, probably perfume, and fold my hand over it so it is hidden. Continue to look at other things on counter and then slowly saunter toward exit. In meantime have casually transferred bottle to my rear trouser pocket. Then an elderly woman in front of me drops her lipstick on floor and looks at it as I come by. I am not anxious to bend down and pick it up, thinking bottle in pocket may show. But I quickly stoop down in sort of feminine fashion, keeping back straight, retrieve it and give it to woman. Then I walk out of store. (144 words)

Am in Florida walking down a street in St. Pete and apparently carrying some luggage or packages in my hand. Pass a girl going in same direction. We walk together and I tell her there is a good restaurant up ahead on the left. As we walk, some sections of sidewalk ahead seem covered with water, but as we get nearer they are always wet, but not covered. Then suddenly to the right I see a motor yacht heading into the sidewalk. We slow down and then the yacht turns parallel to the sidewalk and parks and I see a fat old man in an armchair on the stern. He looks German. On the door heading into a cabin, I see a German word, like "Schwarzbuch." The girl and I walk on to restaurant, but I am disappointed to see it is no longer there. As we pass under a tree, some water flicks on us as a young guy shakes a branch at us. I ignore him, but he does it twice more. Then I put packages down slowly and grab him and hold him on the ground by forcing his head into the dirt with one hand. With the other, I shake a branch and wet him thoroughly. I release him and the girl and I continue walking. (220 words)

Am in the UN building and I see an inside window display or type of showcase in which there is a card saying something about an exhibit on mankind. Focal point is a tall male mannequin or store dummy dressed in mod clothes: tight gray trousers and shiny long leather boots. The model is exact copy of myself and I realize this was done on purpose. Sort of growing out of one part of the dummy is another head, closely resembling me also. But it is decidedly a feminine head. Exhibit includes statuary of some modern shape, plus photos that I cannot distinguish. A woman approaches me as I am looking at exhibit. She is somewhat mannish, but otherwise attractive, and she says she is Mme. Onantis, the photographer of the exhibit. (It's a name I have never heard before.) I tell her how much I like her work and then we walk out of building. Altho sun is shining, it suddenly rains and we decide to wait under the sheltered doorway.(172 words)

There are four of us at the beginning and we are among Those on Earth. A spirit, a powerful angel, comes for us and we follow her through the air to a room -- is it in the clouds? The room is long and narrow, and we sit at chairs on the same side of a long, narrow table, looking blankly at the Earth somewhere below us. My chair is the left-most one, and I have a vague feeling of loss, a vague sense that the right-most seat of the four is empty. The angel announces, "One of us did not make it, and we know what that means." I do not completely understand the remark. Something about the angel reminds me of my mother. The angel then flies down to sing for Those on Earth. The scene is a rock concert, where the angel is on a stage with microphones. Her audience on Earth is very large, and we can see all of this from our seats in the long, narrow room. It is night time and the angel sings of the stars. I look at the sky and the stars appear beautifully to me. I want to see the stars more closely, so I get up and leave the long, narrow room, a move I am not sure I should be making. Curiosity is stronger than doubt and I do go back to the Earth. When I arrive I find I am a butterfly skipping across a large meadow near a mountain. One of Those on Earth sees me and touches me. It is very painful: my body, my wings, all feel as if on fire! Even the very sky turns red as I am touched, and I yell out a very loud, "Ow!" The person touching me can not hear the yell, and touches me again, apparently trying to catch me as I fly away in hurt. The second touch is just as painful. Altogether I am touched two or three times before escaping. Now I am hiding in the mountains, halfway between Earth and the long, narrow room in the sky. I can not go back to either, and I am now alone. And suddenly I have a great insight: the other from my original group on Earth (the one who did not make it to the right-most seat at the long, narrow table) is a butterfly just like me! The butterflies are the ones who leave boredom looking for beauty. The long, narrow room is a place we must go to when its time has come, but it is also a place we leave when we are ready.

I am on vacation with an unidentified girlfriend at "Disney World", which is really a large skyscraper with many trick staircases, secret passageways, etc. I spy X. (a male friend from college) arriving behind me and we move on. I am hiding from him and eventually escape. I stay one step ahead through the staircases and hide, even as another college friend is sent ahead to "see if I'm there, and to get me to join them." I am clever and successful at hiding, but I can not recall the reason for doing so. (94 words)

A group of friends and I are standing in a long line of people waiting to enter a patriotic shrine or public monument. The group is in a rowdy mood and there is much joking and kidding. As we walk single file through an underground hallway at the entrance we notice that there are signs hanging on the walls spelling out the rules for the monument. They state, "No Smoking", "No Eating", "No Drinking", and so on. When we see a sign that says, "No Onions", everyone laughs at how ridiculous this is. "I guess carrots are okay", I joke sarcastically, "just no onions." Someone ahead in the line calls down, "No salad." "No salad?", I respond. "What about vegetable oil?" "No vegetable oil", comes the reply. Sure enough, just then I pass under a doorway where the two lines "No Salad, No Vegetable Oil" are painted overhead. (148 words)

I am still attending college and my family joins me for a morning awards ceremony at which I am being honored. My brother X. is asked to say a few words, but his speech is lengthy and he makes the ceremony last until 11:45 a.m. Now it is time to pack up all of my things and leave the apartment for the summer.

I am from the woods and my pet A. is somehow a deer, not a cat. We export ice from the woods to earn our living, and I am taking part in a large expedition of many woodsmen to make a big ice delivery to the city. A. the deer comes along. I pull by hand a cart filled with large ice blocks along an unpaved, bumpy trail. It is hard work. After passing through a thick wood, A. and I stop in a meadow where I brake the cart so I may rest a few minutes. A. jumps on top of the ice blocks and sits down there. She likes it! More woodsmen pass through the meadow and they think it is humorous to see a deer that likes sitting on ice blocks. The woodsmen and I sit around the cart laughing for a while and everyone is content. (150 words)

I am the only passenger in a car being driven by X. (a female friend) and we follow a car with Y. and Z. (a married couple) into a large parking lot for a shopping center. As Y. and Z. pull ahead and out of sight, I ask X. to stop the car in front of the first store in the shopping center, which happens to be a Genovese Drug Store. "Can you let me off here?", I ask. "I'm going to be late for work." X. is somewhat surprised by this request and she says, "I didn't know you work here." I answer, "I don't want the others to know. This is a temporary job. I quit my other job." Then I get out of the car and run into the drugstore, barely getting to my position behind the counter before being late. There is a flashback and I am resigning from my old job, which was being a spy for Israeli Intelligence. "Spying is very exciting work", I explain to my superior, "but I can not take it anymore. I want a regular job." The spymaster is very understanding and he graciously allows me to leave the intelligence agency. "Do I know too much?", I wonder to myself, referring to information I have gathered during my career. "Probably not", I conclude. (223 words)

X. (a male friend) and I are walking through a public terminal of some kind and it is very crowded as we follow a long line. We are afraid of being caught for something we have done -- what? -- and we are each carrying incriminating pocket-sized pistols. They are loaded, but I am very careful that the trigger on mine is not cocked. There is a security inspection ahead and there is no place to hide the guns. "I'm getting out of here and doing this again", I think. I have some kind of power to go back in time a few hours. The terminal turns out to be an airport, and I go back to the time that my plane is about to land. (Somehow I have now lost X.) This time I am the pilot. I land the plane, and without any announcement, run undetected out of the plane through the indoor gate area of the airport. No one sees me yet and I look for a place to dump the pistol, still concealed in my pants pocket. I find a hedge row of bushes inside the terminal, still unblossomed. I conceal the gun there, hoping it will not be seen. I run through all of the hallways of the airport building, with my "passengers" still waiting on the plane I just landed. I leave the building and run through the parking lot, hoping that I can finally escape. When I reach the spot where I had parked my car, a policeman is standing next to the skeletal remains of a bombed-out automobile. "That's my car!", I cry. "That's my car!" I am very disappointed that now I can not drive away. The main feeling of this dream is of wanting to escape, to go away from the crowd quietly. I am not actually chased, but I run away and am hiding something. (316 words)

I am visiting a museum in a small city located in a vast desert. In the center of a large room stands a dinosaur skeleton which greatly impresses me. "When did people first realize how big dinosaurs were?", I wonder out loud. "It must have been very exciting for the first person who found such large bones!" There is an expert (paleontologist) standing next to me in the museum who replies, "You can see yourself where the bones come from." Upon hearing these words, I run out from the city into an endless desert plain of red-brown sandy soil blown about by a constant wind. Soon I come upon a quarry which is rectangular in shape and perhaps six feet deep. I walk down some steps dug into the ground and look around in the pit. There is a vague awareness of other people in the quarry also looking around. I quickly find some bones lying on the ground, and in the excitement of this discovery, I go running back to the city. I reach a modest ridge just on the outskirts, and get my first clear look at the highly varied architecture of the city, which appears to have grown in my absence. There are buildings in the styles of many ages, and as I leap off the ridge and joyfully bounce from the top of one building to the next, I imagine that I am jumping from century to century. As I jump from the roof of a two-story 18th Century Colonial brick house to the top of a 20th Century glass skyscraper high in the clouds, I wonder, "If only they (the dinosaurs) could see how much we (humans) have accomplished!"

I am riding with my brother X. on a long train which I later realize is the Long Island Railroad. The train is one of the modern, electrified lines and we are moving along quickly. As I peer out the front of our car, I see the car being disconnected. There is a thick cable pulled out of the front of the car, and we are reconnected to another train. Now we are moving much more slowly. I see the train we had been previously connected to now on a parallel track to the right of us, and it passes us. I remark to my brother, "This is as slow as the Port Jefferson line!", referring to an older line with diesel trains. (123 words)

I am among a group of friends at my home having a discussion, and I say something witty (I can not remember what.) To impress them I say, "That's a line from Shakespeare." "Which play?", someone asks. "I don't know", I answer, "but I have his collected works." Next to the table where we are all seated is my bookcase, and I pull down the red-covered volume entitled, "Shakespeare's Collected Works", and begin leafing through the index of quotations. I find a reference to one of the historical plays (which one?) and open to that page. As we read aloud from there, one of the women in the group suggests, "We should try it in a real theater." Somehow we indeed next find ourselves in a real theater with a live audience. All the members of the original group now have copies of the red-covered "Collected Works" to use as scripts, and a few of us, including myself, walk out onto the stage in order to perform from the same page that was read in my home. I begin to read the part named "King" opposite one of my woman friends who reads the part of the "Queen". There is a hub-bub from the audience and we are not being heard well. Another man (a friend of mine?) is now also trying to read the part of the King. Sensing confusion, I ask him softly, "Oh, do you want the part? That's fine.", and I relinquish my role. Seeing that the lines are still being barely heard by the audience, I instruct both he and the Queen, "In Shakespeare, you have to PROJECT." The last word I speak loudly and clearly, and it rings throughout the theater. Murmurs of agreement in the audience follow, and then silence for the first time. I decide that since I no longer have an acting part in the play, I will be the director, and I slip behind a convenient shell on the floor at front center stage. The Queen reads her lines, and then I give a cue to a young girl, maybe eight years old, to read her part, that of a young princess or a magical fairy. Then the King recites some lines to the young girl. Both the audience and I are moved by the performance. (386 words)

A large group of friends -- maybe a dozen or so -- and I enter a pub or inn in a small cottage. The building is very old, and the pub is reminiscent of Medieval England. We seat ourselves in a stuffy room at a long rectangular table made of a very sturdy wood and covered by a thin tablecloth. One end of the table is near a stained-glass window which shines colored light in an otherwise dimly lit environment. In the next room is a kitchen where much cooking is occuring. I have a vague notion of pizzas being prepared for our group as we sit around drinking beers from large mugs and making a lot of noise. Since it is a medieval- style establishment, there are certainly no modern inventions, such as television, around. Someone asks, "Did you bring the TV? You have to bring your own here." Another person produces a portable set and places it on a tall bench near the end of the table. The group goes crazy and starts chanting, "Pella-vision! Pella-vision! Pella-vision!", emphasizing each syllable equally. The word is understood to mean a television brought into the pub by its patrons for the purpose of entertainment. As the dream ends, I am caught up in the frenzy of my friends as we eagerly anticipate watching some program on the tube. (227 words)

I awaken from a nap and reach out to fetch my eyeglasses from a nearby table. Something is wrong with one of the lenses -- the left one. The part of the lens near the nosepiece has become very thin and has begun to peel away as if made of tranparent paper. I touch it there and more of the lens flakes away. Very soon the flaking ceases and about half of the left lens is gone, leaving a large hole in the glass. I put the glasses on my face and think to myself, "It looks like the damage has stopped. At least I can still use them." The dream ends with a feeling of making due with what I have despite setbacks. (124 words)

I look out the big picture window of the living room of my apartment. Directly ahead, standing in a line by the curbside, are four women with balloons. Each woman has two balloons attached to her chest, making it appear as if she has a very large pair of breasts. Upon looking more closely, I see that each balloon is indeed decorated to resemble a naked breast, including a big nipple at the end. One of the women has painted a hideously elaborate set of blue and red blood vessels on her balloons as well. The women are carrying signs and shouting some sort of slogan. I say to myself, "These are feminists protesting something." I go out into the front yard to investigate. There on the lawn is a great commotion: a large number of people are sitting in folding chairs set up everywhere. Many of them are dressed for a political convention, wearing striped jackets with large buttons on the lapel and funny straw hats colored red, white and blue. I am extremely annoyed because these people have occupied my front yard. "Is this a convention organized by my landlord?", I angrily demand aloud. No one pays attention as all interest seems turned towards a rectangular table covered with a white cloth at the center of the yard. I fight my way through the crowd, vowing to find out if my landlord is at the center table. I see a few men wearing formal black suits seated behind the table, but my landlord is not among them.

A game of street baseball is being played, and it is my turn to bat. Among the fielders are two brothers, and I hear someone remark that it is nice to see them together again after a recent reconciliation. The older brother is in his mid-50's with just a few gray hairs, but is in very good physical shape and is quite strong. The younger brother appears to be about 40, has black hair and a moustache, and is easy-going in nature. The brothers are black. The older brother pitches, while the younger one plays the field somewhere near first or second base. The first pitch whizzes by me with incredible speed, stopped behind me by a solid wall of some sort. Unsure of my grip on the bat, I swing wildly, missing the ball by a large margin. "He plays hardball", I say, referring to the pitcher. "He used to be in the majors", someone informs me. A second fastball goes past me just as quickly as the first; I miss again, but this time my swing is a little better. This happens a few more times, each time my swing improving while still missing the ball. The older brother then brusquely announces, "0 for 6, time for the next batter." The younger brother takes offense at this and urges giving me another chance by saying, "He's just getting the hang of it." A brief argument ensues between the two over whether I should continue batting. Each is disgusted with his brother's position, and they turn their backs toward each other and will not speak. Someone says, "This is just like their last argument, and they didn't speak to each other for a long time after that." Attempting the role of peacemaker, I say to both brothers, "C'mon. You have to look for what you have in common." (309 words)

I am in a room looking apprehensively at a blank wall, knowing that something is about to happen. Then I see it and I exclaim, "It's the Blue Hand!" An ethereal, translucent, dark blue right hand, cut off at the wrist, slowly rises up the wall. The hand does not gesture, but is always in an upright position. I find the sight both frightening and intriguing. I dare not approach the wall, yet I want to know more about the hand, suspecting that it wants to tell me something. As the hand reaches the top of the wall, it thins out and then disappears. (104 words)

There is a performance of a musical opera which is set on ships at sea. In the first scene a group of two or three pirates kidnap three young ladies. Further details from the first scene are sketchy. The second scene takes place on the pirate ship, where the three lady hostages have been taken. In this opera, the decks of the ship are represented on stage by large sleeping hammocks. The ladies lie on the lower deck, or hammock, while the pirates are on the upper deck, or hammock. The pirates, singing their lines, decide amongst themselves to tease their captives. They proceed to do this by swinging the lower hammock back and forth in order to make the ladies dizzy. While swinging the hammock, they sing together in a strong clear voice. One of the ladies, however, is not bothered by the hammock swinging and she answers the pirates' song with a clear soprano voice of her own. The pirates sing their song louder, only to have the soprano answer in an aria which grows more and more beautiful, expressing her determination to be heard. (187 words)

I am a crew member aboard the Starship Enterprise featured in the television show, "Star Trek, the Next Generation." I am among a large group sitting around a circular table in the ship's bar/lounge enjoying themselves. One of the crew ("Riker") says, "We have to get back to work now." Everyone at the table, except the Captain ("Picard") and I, gets up and goes off together. Sitting alone with the Captain as he sips his drink, I say, "You know that I have to go with them." The Captain nods his head in an understanding way and says, "Yes, I know." I get up from the table and start backing off, still facing the Captain. Suddenly I am whizzing backwards across the floor at a great speed, as if pulled by some strange force. I speed in this manner out of the bar through a small corrider and into a room where the other crew members from the bar are standing. They are all startled by my entrance, and one of them ("Jordi") says, "He's being pulled by some mysterious force!" There is a set of elevators near the middle of the room, and I zoom directly into an open shaft and fall in. The other crew members are very concerned and look down the shaft to find some trace of me. "It's okay!", one of them exclaims. "His dog is still there!" Sure enough, at the bottom of the elevator shaft my pet dog (a small black terrier) wags his tail and barks to demonstrate that he has taken the fall and is fine. I, too, am fine and am hiding underneath the neighboring elevator. I laugh at the crew who were so worried about me and call up to them, "That was a good trick I played on you, huh?" (302 words)

I am at the arrival area of a large airport going through immigration and customs. An official takes my passport and places it down on a table with many papers as I pass through a gate of some kind, similar to a metal detector. On the other side of the gate I am handed my passport back. I get to my home and ask myself, "Did I check the passport?" I open the blue- covered passport and see inside the name and photograph of a Chinese man. "Oh, no", I think, "they gave me the wrong one." Thinking that I might contact the Chinese man to exchange passports with him, I look through the passport for an address or telephone number. All I can find instead are glossy color pages picturing an item that the Chinese man has brought through customs. The item is a universal exercise machine with weights, pulleys, benches, etc. I become anxious believing that now I will have to go through the bureaucratic procedure of obtaining a new passport.

I am standing on a city sidewalk with X. (a female friend) and we are waiting to meet someone. An older woman dressed in a dark overcoat and a fedora hat approaches us; she is a spy or an agent of some kind who wishes to relay information. She says, "Now I can tell you what I have learned. The secret is . . . ". At the very instant she is about to tell us the secret, a bullet appears out of nowhere and knocks her down, just like a scene out of a cheap detective story. I look out into the street and three taxicabs pull up ominously by the curb where we are standing. The three cabs are painted identically: yellow with a black-and- white checkered trim. Sitting inside are hoodlums or gangsters who are threatening us. "I guess we have to go with them", I say to X. The two of us get into the middle cab and we are taken away. We drive past a corner where a policeman who doesn't seem to notice us is standing. "Just my luck!", I say, "The police don't see you when you need them." After going around the corner, the cab stops, lets me out, and drives off. I am standing in front of a two-story brownstone apartment building. "This is my house!", I say, thinking that I have outwitted my kidnappers. I climb some stairs to the upstairs apartment and enter. The neighbors in the buildings on both sides see me and call out greetings. (258 words)

This dream takes place in a park very reminiscent of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. I am scheduled to give a public lecture outdoors, and an older person, the organizer of the lecture series, tells me to get dressed for the event. I walk off to a secluded part of the park near a fountain and proceed to undress. I am quite embarrassed by this, and hope that nobody sees me. (No one does.) When I remove my underwear, it becomes hopelessly tangled with the new pair of underwear, like two links in a chain. Struggling, I manage to put on the new pair as the old pair hangs at my side. I finish dressing and tuck the old underwear under my shirt, hoping nobody will notice it. I walk over to an area of benches where people are waiting for the lecture to begin. I see X. (a female friend) sitting there and walk up to her. "This is going to be a good lecture", I promise her. (170 words)

X (a former male co-worker) presents me with a greeting card and asks me to read it. I read aloud some printing in English. "No, not that part", X says. "I can read that. Read this part." He points to some handwriting at the top of the card which is in Spanish. I read aloud again, this time translating the Spanish into English for him. (I do not recall what anything on the card actually said, but I do recall that the Spanish section was about one or two sentences of simple words that I could easily recognize.) (98 words)

A group of friends which includes X. and Y. (a married couple), and I are standing around in my living room. There is a pause in the conversation and Y. says, "Everybody! X. has an announcement to make." All eyes turn to X. After hesitating for a second, X. blurts out, "Y. and I are going to have a baby!" I am surprised by the announcement and exclaim, "Oh, I am so happy for you!" I turn to Y., who happens to be standing next to me, and give her a big hug. "This is great news", I say to her and X., but actually I have very mixed feelings. I am concerned that I will be spending less time with my friends and drifting apart from them. (128 words)

My father, my brother X. and I are standing in a line at a bank. My turn comes and I step up to the cashier's window to cash a check. After receiving my money, the teller asks, "Do you want the free coffee with that?" Suprised by this offer, I accept and am handed a coupon. I think to myself, "I wonder what 'coffee' means." I'm then taken (alone) to a big ballroom or dining hall in the back. At the door I'm handed a cup of coffee and a plate of pastries. I walk up to some round tables in the middle of the room and see that there is bread on the tables and that many people are sitting and eating. "Oh, it's a whole Continental breakfast," I say. I look for a place to sit, but the occupied tables are all full. Before sitting down I realize, "The bank is in a hotel." I go back to the cashier window, which is now an ornate desk in the hotel lobby, and see that my father has just gotten some money and is walking away with X. He sees me and says, "Oy, I didn't get a breakfast." From his tone of voice it is clear that he regrets forgetting to ask for his free breakfast. (218 words)

I am lying on the floor of my house next to the fireplace with my calico cat A. Somehow the sliding glass door to the back yard opens up and a black stray cat wanders inside. This cat has a scraggly appearance with unkempt hairs standing out from its body; in general it is ugly. A. sees the other cat and instantly runs toward it. I am quite concerned that the two cats will start fighting, but from my prone position am unable to reach either cat. A. rubs up against the black cat, and they act friendly toward each other. The ugly cat rolls itself up into a smooth black ball and A. rolls herself up into a smooth white ball. The two balls of fur continue rubbing each other and I hear a lot of purring. (138 words)

I look out my living room window at early dawn while it is still somewhat dark both indoors and out and see a man with an animal head facing me head on. I stare at him eye to eye for a few minutes to figure out who he is and what he wants, not sure all the while whether he is able to see me back through the dimly lit glass. The sun comes up and now it is daylight. "He is a masked burglar staking out my house", I think. I run to the door, open it and rush out. The potential burglar sees me coming and runs away across my front lawn and down the street. As he flees I notice that his animal head is an elaborate mask of a wild boar with a lot of hair and a snout nose. There are some children playing on the street, and I warn them, "He is a burglar. Beware of him." (163 words)

I am a traveller carrying one light bag and looking for a place to spend the night. I do not have a lot of money and someone suggests a place. We walk there to discover a hostel of a sort in a large indoor space big enough to house a gymnasium. I find a spot near a corner and prepare for bed. I think to myself, "Luckily I have my high-tech pillow." I take out of my bag a light, flat panel about 8 by 10 inches and the thickness of a thick piece of cardboard. "It works by applying a voltage.", I say. "There's a new kind of material which fluffs up when you apply a voltage." On the face of the panel is a liquid-crystal display with two "buttons", one labelled "on" and one labelled "off". I touch the "on" button with my index finger and the flat panel magically inflates to the dimensions of a fluffy pillow. I lay it down on the ground and comfortably go to sleep. (172 words)

I am floating down a river alone on a small inflatable raft. I lie on my back admiring the scenery on a bright sunny day. Underneath me on the raft are various personal items including towels, shirts, cans of drinks, and a portable radio. As I slowly move from where the river is narrow and thick with vegetation to a wide open stretch, I listen to the radio which is playing a sad Country & Western song about a heart-broken cowboy. The radio is buried in the pile of clothing and is apparently sinking lower and lower into the pile as the music becomes more and more muffled. Nonetheless, I hear the words of the song quite clearly: the song ends with the cowboy telling his former lover, "Maybe tomorrow I'll love again, But I won't be at your door." (140 words)

I am in my office at work with the lights off. Just outside the door there is a party going on in the hallway. Many classmates from college are there loudly talking to each other, apparently ignorant of my presence nearby. "What a coincidence that they have the party so close to my office", I think to myself. Before saying hello, I decide that I will turn on the lights. I flip the switch which normally turns on an overhead fluorescent light, but this doesn't work. Next I try turning on a small lamp on top of a tall file cabinet, but this doesn't work either. With myself still in the dark, X. (a male friend from college) walks into the office and I say, "Oh, hi X." (128 words)

Woody Allen is in Boston at the bar "Cheers" featured on the television show of the same name. I am standing at the bar counter with a group of people who are admiring Mr. Allen from a distance, but who are unable to muster the courage to go up to talk to him. "I'll do it", I say and I walk up to the table where Mr. Allen is seated. I say hello and tell him that I am a great admirer of his. He looks at me blankly as he signs an autograph on a napkin. After that there is a brief pause in the conversation during which I feel upset that our encounter has been merely a shallow exchange of pleasantries. I decide to elevate the intellectual level of the conversation and find out more about the views and opinions of Woody Allen. "What do you think about Ross Perot?", I ask, referring to the undeclared Presidential candidate. Woody Allen's eyes widen with interest when the question is asked, as if he is finding more in me than expected. I await an answer, but I can not recall any more of the dream after this point.

I am reading about a new type of professional soccer league in a color weekly news magazine. There is a description of the game and some of the new teams, including a team named the "Cosmos", which the magazine article says may follow in a "tradition of dynasty by previous teams of the same name in earlier leagues." I find myself at the opening game playing for the "Cosmos". The rules are a bit changed from regular soccer: a center square portion of the field is quite a bit raised in elevation over the rest (i.e., it is not a level playing field.) This center portion is landscaped with bushes and trees, and the rest of the field, which looks like a standard field, is reached by steep ramps. Play begins at the center of the square section. The ball makes its way towards the goal of the opponents of the "Cosmos". I am standing there, and when the ball is nearby I kick it to the goal. I watch almost as if in slow-motion as the opponents' goal-keeper misses. I have scored a goal and everyone in the crowd cheers! Play resumes. I see that several players use their hands in this version of soccer, but I am not sure when this is allowed, so I decide to play as if it were regular soccer. Again I am standing near the opposing goal as the ball comes. I break out of a pack of players to get to the ball and from the right wing position I kick it into the goal. The poor opposing goalkeeper looks overwhelmed as the score goes by him. In an apparently new rule, after the goal is scored the goalkeeper himself kicks out the ball into play (instead of starting at the center of the field.) The opposing team plays sloppily and I quickly get possession of the ball again. I boot it hard directly at the goal and score a third time. The crowd goes wild as I exclaim, "I LOVE this game!" I turn to my brother X., who is one of my "Cosmos" teammates, and confide to him, "Their goalie is not too good; they should get another one." (369 words)

My brother X. and I drive to a beach in the cool autumn. I set up a chair near the roadway and X. wanders a little bit down the sloping beach. He gathers a lot of sand from nearby and builds an elevated walkway leading to the top of a two-story, tall, round castle turret. He sets up his chair there and surveys the entire beach. I am bored with my position and decide to explore. I follow the elevated sand walkway and reach the turret. The view is nice, but there are some large rocks ahead which block the vista of the sea. I leave the smoothly constructed sand castle and climb down onto the rough, jagged rocks. The going is slow but I eventually reach the top of a tall rock right at the water's edge. I look below and see Y. (a female friend from work) swimming in the ocean. "Come on in", she calls, "it's nice." "The water must be too cold this time of year", I reply, and I do not go any further.

My mother and I are strolling outdoors on the landscaped grounds of a college campus. Suddenly the flat quadrangle we had been crossing ends abruptly at a small cliff. There is a vertical metal ladder at the edge of the cliff which my mother carefully climbs down. Now it is my turn, but I hesitate, wishing for a better way to descend. I now see that nearby there is a small cable car suspended from a loose wire cable. I grab the car with my hands and turn it so that the door faces me. I jump inside and the car starts moving wildly. It bounces up and down and sways to either side. I wish to steer the car, but find that I can not see where I am going: my eyes are closed tightly and are unable to open. (141 words)

My brother X. and I arrive for a vacation at a very busy airport in Israel. As we are walking through the terminal, I realize that our luggage did not arrive with us. "Oh", I say, "we were supposed to claim it in Cairo", referring to a previous stop-over in the Egyptian capital. "We have to go back there and get the bags." We struggle through the overcrowded terminal and reach a set of elevators. The elevator I am standing in front of takes a long time to reach our floor and I grow impatient. Just as I start walking towards another elevator, X. cries out, "Here it is!" The original elevator opens, and a large mob sweeps us in with them. When I get off the elevator, I find myself alone at Cairo Airport. In marked contrast to its Israeli counterpart, this airport is quiet, relaxed and almost empty. I find myself lying down outdoors on a patch of grass near a runway. The sun shines brightly and the airfield is surrounded by lush green trees. As I lazily look up from my siesta, I spot a small, single-passenger pedal-powered airplane hovering overhead. The pilot spins his craft, then stops it in mid-air, as he pedals what looks like a black flywheel with bicycle pedals attached. Then he releases the flywheel and glides away. The flywheel falls quickly and strikes a young man lying on the ground close to me. He does not appear to be hurt, but he is clearly annoyed. There is a young woman lying at his side who says of the pilot, "What an idiot!" Then the two of them look at each other and she hugs him around the waist. I get up and walk towards a nearby building. On the way a large group of teenagers passes in the opposite direction. At first I see a few boys and a few girls and do not note anything unusual. Then I see a boy walk by wearing a tank-top shirt which exposes his highly muscular arms. Soon another boy with a similar shirt walks by; he, too, has highly muscular arms. After him follows another boy with muscular arms, and then another and another. As the dream ends, there is a parade of youths with muscular arms walking past. (385 words)

Under a dark night sky, I am sitting outdoors at a large, popular music concert with a group of friends. The seats are the overly soft, somewhat worn, but very comfortable chairs that are found in many old movie theaters. My friends and I are all sitting in the same row listening to the music, which is very loud and is being perfomed by the "Mammas and Pappas". Their song intoxicates the entire audience. One row in front of us some people stand up and sit down to form a "wave". This wave is carried everywhere and I feel the chair I am sitting in rhythmically rise and fall every few seconds, as if it were floating on a sea with real waves of great height. This is a pleasurable thrill, a joyous release, and I am ecstatically carried away in the motion of the chair, the loud music, and the happiness of everyone around me. This physical high lasts for quite a while. (164 words)

It is time for X., a graduate student who is collaborating on research with our group at work, to defend his Ph.D. dissertation. Somehow X. has changed his field to music, and the doctoral defense is to be a piano recital. An appropriate recital hall has been set up, and I am among a group of people making a last minute check of the arrangements. We discover to our annoyance that the furniture on stage is lacking and that the piano is either missing or is not suitable. We leave the hall briefly and return carrying new furniture. One of the other people rolls in a beautiful grand piano on wheels. To test it out, we all sit around the keyboard and take turns improvising and singing silly songs. (129 words)

My former co-workers from the University of X. and I are standing outside on a grassy field with our (male) boss Y. Y. points his finger towards a building in the distance and says, "We have to get the equipment in that building." We suddenly find ourselves rummaging through the contents of a very large room. As we sort through dusty laboratory equipment, my mother, who has apparently joined our group, announces, "Here is his old clarinet!" She hands me the gray carrying case for the musical instrument and tells me, "Why don't you play it for us?" I open the case and assemble the clarinet. I play some notes, faking a melody as I go along. After thinking to myself, "I wonder if I can still do the upper register", I press the upper register shift key with my index finger and blow hard. A high-pitched note comes out clearly, and I continue inventing a melody. (157 words)

I am seated in an auditorium with many other people attending a seminar or training program. An announcement is made that the program is concluded and it is now time for all attendees to pick up their diplomas. A queue forms, and the person standing next to me in the line says, "You have to show the card you got when you paid the registration fee." "Oh", I reply, "I left the card in my room." I rush out of the auditorium and run through the hallways of what turns out to be a large hotel. I arrive at my room, and find my "roommate", X. (a male friend from college) there. "I'm getting my registration card", I tell him, but I do not find it there. Sensing that the card is back in the auditorium after all, I begin returning that direction. In the hallway I encounter Y. (a male colleague from work) walking past. "It's almost over", he informs me. "You'd better hurry." I run back to the auditorium to find it almost empty. A Strauss waltz is playing as a wooden partition or curtain is slowly being lowered over the stage. I run to my seat and see my receipt card lying there on top of my papers. Grabbing the card I cry out, "Wait! Wait!" (219 words)

I am in the experimental area at work talking on the phone with X., a colleague. Discussing the removal of a piece of apparatus that he and I had worked on, he informs me, "The lead-glass is really gone." He repeats this line three or four times. During the conversation I look out at the experiment and observe that a pressure test is being perfomed on the gas tank that we refer to as "GAS-C". As this happens I feel high air pressure in the lab affecting my ears. Someone walks by and remarks, "The GAS-C can take over two atmospheres." Suddenly there is an explosion and I watch in horror as the GAS-C tank blows out, damaging some other equipment nearby. The tank then shrivels up. Y. (a male collaborator) wraps the shriveled tank and surrounding layers in a blanket and carries it off with some other people for repairs. (151 words)

I examine the coins in some change I am given and find a very unusual nickel. On the reverse is a scene of the signing of the Declaration of Independence with many people; this scene is so large and busy that it is bursting out of the sides of the coin. The front of the coin has the normal face of Thomas Jefferson, and I see the year, "1937", clearly stand out. "This old coin must be worth something", I think. (81 words)

As a teacher in charge of some course, I am grading papers and I reach the one handed in by X. (a female friend). She didn't answer half of the questions, so I give her zeros for those parts. On the other questions, she has written only short answers, so I give her five points out of ten on each. Her low score bothers me and I decide to raise the score on some questions to six points, then seven. "Maybe I am being too hard on her", I think. (90 words)

After a long journey I arrive at a house where I am to meet someone or encounter something. I wander alone about the house, which turns out to be my parents' house. Anxiously I wait for something to happen, vaguely aware that I will be meeting a group, perhaps of space aliens or magical elves. As I walk down the hallway and into the living room, I say to myself, "Now it's time." The curtains for the big picture window are open and there is a clear view of the outdoors. I step into the window as if to walk through it, but when I get there I find that everything on the other side is made of glass just like the window itself. I walk around in this glassy world where the view is translucent but blurry. All the objects I see, including trees, grass and rocks, radiate light through the eerie haze. (154 words)

My parents are divorced (in the dream). My brothers and I live at their house with my mother -- even though we are fully grown -- and my father lives in the city with his mother. He comes to visit and we have a lot of fun. I wonder why we don't see each other more often. I say, "Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but parents should stay together for the children's sake." One of my parents -- I'm not sure which one -- answers, "People change; we drifted apart; you're all grown up for years now." I feel anger followed by either resignation or acceptance of a loss.

I am on a space ship or station and there is a technical problem with some equipment on another ship or station. A friend of mine on board with me is worried about the problem, but I find myself telling him over a radio of some sort not to worry because I am fixing the problem. "You see", I say to him, "I went outside for a space walk." Indeed, I suddenly am out in space, working with some tools on the other ship or station. I finish the job and then radio to my friend, "As you know, there is no gravity here so I can just push myself back." I give myself a shove off the repaired vessel and begin drifting through the black space towards the mother space vessel. Just before reaching there, I see the big blue Earth a little to the side of my destination, and I slowly begin to change direction toward the planet. "Oh, oh", I say to my friend on the other end of the radio, "I'm feeling some gravity after all!" I still move slowly, floating through space and I see the Earth looming larger and larger as a giant blue and white globe. I pass through some kind of dense white barrier, like a cloud, and I radio to my friend, "Now I'm in the atmosphere. I should be burning up soon." My slow, floating re-entry now suddenly picks up speed, and I accelerate faster and faster in free fall, like a man who has jumped out of an airplane without a parachute. I then suddenly turn into a long, thin ribbon of ashes strewn across the sky for many miles. Still somehow retaining consciousness, I think to myself words to the effect of, "What a glorious way to go. Life has been a big adventure and I now I return to be ashes scattered all over the Earth. I will miss being able to see and hear, but this death is an adventure too." The dream ends with a feeling of exhilaration. (343 words)

I am walking along a dirt trail and I notice that someone is following behind. I quicken my pace but the person behind keeps up with me. Soon the trail gets wet with puddles and then it gets very muddy. I continue ahead but the mud becomes waist deep and so thick that I can barely move my legs. I am still being followed and I want to keep moving, so I grab some rocks and vines along the trail side with my hands and I pull myself forward. I repeat this a few times, moving very slowly since the trail now goes uphill. Finally I pull myself out of the mud and I see ahead a large lake at the base of a mountain, shining brilliantly in the sunlight. I feel that I have reached some sort of destination, but am disappointed in it. "This isn't the way it was described in X.'s paper", I say to myself, referring to a paper written by a male colleague at work. (170 words)

I am in a big lecture hall auditorium attending a class on gospel singing. The other students in the class talk a lot and seem more interested in sports, especially in the Mets game. I get in trouble for talking during the class and ask the teacher, "Why ME?" I am banished from the room for my bad behavior, and I promise the teacher to leave if I am allowed to speak before the class for "just one sentence." I stand before them all and proclaim proudly, "You all know, I'm the biggest fan." Then I gather my papers and march slowly out of the room with pride. (108 words)

I am at my parents' house and I see my father and his father working on fixing the back door. The entire frame around the door is loose and needs to be fastened back up. I see my grandfather holding everthing up -- door, surrounding molding, and even a little of the wall -- while my father is doing some sort of fastening. I say, "Let me help", and I assist in holding up the door and surrounding material. I overhear my grandfather telling my father about his father (my great grandfather), "When he was very old he would get out of the house and go for walks. We nailed the door shut but he would get out anyway and trample over three rows of flowers in the garden. We would find him just walking aimlessly around the neighborhood. He always said he just had to get outside." Now I look at my father and he looks older than I have ever remembered him being and I start to confuse him with my grandfather. I have trouble distinguishing the two of them and I try very hard to figure out which one is which. (194 words)

There is a knock at the front door of my house and I answer to find a slightly overweight middle-aged woman. She says, "Take me", and gives me a warm hug and a big kiss. I send her away, thinking to myself, "This is tempting but I don't know her." The screen door comes off its hinges as the woman leaves, and I try to put it back in place. Just then I hear some noises coming from the far side of my front lawn. I go out to investigate and find a group of maybe half a dozen people depositing bagged trash on the grass. I yell angrily at them and they disperse. However, I see that behind where the trash bags were placed is an encampment of several tents and shacks, all covered with twigs and sticks. "Look what they've done!", I complain to a friend who has just appeared. The friend and I run towards the encampment and grab at the sticks when we reach the first row of tents. Knocking the sticks aside, we are surprised to learn that the tents are all empty inside. "They must have left", I deduce. (195 words)

I am reading a ski magazine full of advertisements showing sexy pictures. I find it boring and I flip through the pages quickly. Finally I come across something which I find amusing: a middle section of the magazine which is a parody of itself. This joke section has a false cover page which shows skiers going downhill unsafely in various ways: skiing backwards without looking in the direction of travel, two people sharing the same pair of skis, and a passenger sitting on the shoulders of another skier headed straight towards a tree. The silly humor of this cover is a welcome relief from the slickness of the rest of the magazine. (112 words)

My girlfriend X. and I are on a guided tour of the White House in Washington, D. C. The tour guide informs us that tonight the President (Clinton) will attend a performance of a famous female singer (I can not recall which one.) The tour ends and I go to my parents' house for dinner. At the dinner table I mention that X. and I are going back out after the meal. We then get into a car and drive around a big city at night. We see a theater all lit up with a big marquee announcing a singing performance of the famous female singer. "Oh that lucky Bill Clinton", I say, "She is performing for him." Suddenly X. and I are walking around the inside lobby of the theater, where the furnishings are plush and ornate, and where everyone is formally dressed. Out of the corner of my eye I see my mother walk past. She is dressed up for the concert also, but she doesn't see me. I keep walking by, hoping not to be noticed. I vaguely hear X.'s voice behind me, sounding surprised at meeting my parents, but I keep walking ahead. Now there is an escalator and I go down. I hear my name being called but I am out of everyone's sight and I keep walking to another escalator, which I descend. Another time my name is called -- it is my mother's voice -- and now I feel as if I can not escape any longer. I look up and I see a balcony about two stories above me. There are my mother, my father and my girlfriend looking down at me. (280 words)

I am outdoors on a sunny day at a large public gathering, where the atmosphere is something between a carnival and a revival meeting. A young man stands before a crowd and tries to sell himself as a psychic and predictor of future events with unusual powers. The crowd quietly listens to him, but I can tolerate it no longer. I walk to the front to challenge him. "Is there any proof of his powers?", I ask. "Yes", the young man answers, and he waves about a copy of a hard-cover book written by himself with a photograph of himself on the cover. I find this most unsatisfying and I deliver the real challenge: would he be willing to write down SPECIFIC predictions for the next ten years? "We can write them down tomorrow and check again after ten years.", I propose. (142 words)

A car carrying two people inside pulls into the driveway of my house. The driver is a short, young woman who gets out of the car and walks to my front door where I am standing. She looks confused and opens a small piece of paper with the words "Republic Airport" written down, indicating that she is lost and seeks help. "It is not far from here", I say. Then she explains that her passenger is "X.'s wife", i.e., the wife of my girlfriend's boss. She asks if I can drive the two of them to the airport. I hesitate. Then the passenger gets out of the car and comes to the door. She is a tall, attractive middle-aged woman. "Pleased to meet you, Doctor Y.", she says to me gracefully. Impressed that she knows my title, I think to myself, "She really knows who I am." Then I say to the two women, "Okay, let's go." (157 words)

I am at a scientific conference being held in a large auditorium. I am sitting somewhere in the middle section when it is my turn to speak. I go to the front of the room and show my slides. Afterwards I sit down again, this time on the right-hand side of the hall. Looking among my papers, I find a book containing copies of all of the slides from all of the talks, including my own. One of my graphs is reproduced in a shiny metallic ink. "Oh, this is a good idea", I say to myself about the book. (100 words)

There is a woman who is the wife of someone else appearing earlier in the dream. Just to do something wild, she throws plastics bags filled with English Muffins into the swimming pool water and then she goes underwater herself. Inside the water it is peaceful and very quiet and she enjoys just sitting there, isolated from the outside world. She stands up and stares at the surface of the water which has now become a vertical wall rather than a horizontal ceiling. "It's nice here, but I can't live without oxygen", she thinks to herself, and she pokes her head through the vertical wall to the outside world. Now it is suddenly quite noisy. (115 words)

I am driving my bicycle down a country road which is on the way to work, moving very fast as if the bicycle were an automobile instead. I am not driving too carefully because I am tired, and I think to myself that I should really be going back home instead of to work. Suddenly a small deer -- a fawn -- walks out into the middle of the road as I race past. Then another small deer does the same, and this time I almost hit it. I keep going on and I next see a few more deer which are fully grown standing in the middle of the road. Finally a truly large, obese deer blocks much of the road and I stop. I walk my bicycle onto the sidewalk in order to catch my breath. There is a man standing nearby who admonishes, "Don't ride your bicycle on the sidewalk!" I walk my bike back onto the street, and as I mount it I answer him, "Look, I'm NOT riding on the sidewalk." (176 words)

I am travelling by train through England with some friends. In our car there is an official reception for the Queen of England who is travelling in the next car. My friends have brought chemicals with them and they start mixing them together. One of the male friends explains that they are making an explosive because he wants to blow up the Queen. I am disturbed by this, but another friend pleads with me to keep quiet. I remain silent since they are friends, but I feel that this is wrong. Finally, I can stand this moral outrage no more and I act decisively. I grab a glass bottle filled with a clear liquid and pour it out a sliding door on the train, thus thwarting the bombers' plans. A guard or policeman is standing there, and I complain to him, "You need tighter security around your Queen. In my country, you'd never get so close to the President with the materials for a bomb."

I am watching the filming of a movie scene involving three or four fast-moving cars. The people in the cars are all young and crazy, and they are having a lot of fun doing outrageous things, such as sitting outside on the roof of the car as it speeds. One young lady leans out of a passenger-side window so far that only her feet are still in the car; her head is held up by a man standing on the hood of the car next to hers. Suddenly one of the cars bumps into a structure on the side of the road and catches fire. The car comes to a stop by a nearby building, causing the building to catch fire also. A big wall of fire jumps out and now several buildings in the vicinty are burning as well. I am standing outside and am now surrounded by the flames. I am not sure whether this is a tragic accident or a planned part of the movie. (168 words)

I am asked to serve on an advisory commission in Washington, D. C. and be made an Honorary Member of Congress as part of some government program. I am flattered by the honor and I accept. Someone tells me that there is an orientation meeting for my group at 9 a.m., but I miss it. I arrive at the Capitol Building, and I can't find anything. I am standing in a large hallway made entirely of marble when I recognize other people in my program walking about, seeming to know where they are going. I ask several of them for directions, and they answer with the names of departments that I have never heard of. "How was the meeting this morning?", I ask another. "Oh, it was funny", he answers, "They did a show. But you didn't miss anything important." I am still lost, but I get a copy of a map that says "Federal Triangle" on the cover. Inside is the layout of many of federal office buildings with each individual office marked. "Wow, this is a useful map!", I think to myself. Then it is time to make plans for the evening. I say, "Should I stay here or go home?" X. (a friend of mine on Long Island, originally from England), who is standing next to me, says, "Well, I went home from here, but you'll have to fly if you want to get back in time in the morning." "You flew back to Long Island?", I ask him. "No", he answers, "I flew back to LONDON." I decide to stay in a hotel in Washington. (269 words)

I am at a gas station and a bad guy, "Charlie Brown", is coming to do mischief. I get up on the roof of the gas station in order to defend. When Charlie Brown arrives, I have the element of surprise. I jump down and somehow get him to a position where he is lying on the ground helpless. I have a rifle with me and I fire it in his general direction, apparently not actually harming him. He is shocked that I would shoot at a defenseless man and he tells me, "I wouldn't shoot if you were lying here." (101 words)

I am standing outside and I see a wall to my left. I walk up to it and notice that is a work of art, a piece of sculpture. It is painted blue and yellow, with parts decorated in a silvery metal. I examine it closely, marvelling at intricate carvings on its surface. "I wonder if it's real", I think to myself. "It's so detailed that this can't be a dream." (71 words)

I am delivering a guest lecture for a colleague in a modern college auditorium which has a lot of high-technology audio- visual aids set up. The audience in the lecture hall is small, but a video camera broadcasts my face to a medium-sized television screen. I feel that I am not effectively making my point, which is about books written by a forgotten author. While still talking, I fumble around with cables, trying to connect the video signal to a larger screen. Finally it works and my image appears on a movie-sized screen hanging from the ceiling. I feel more confident now because this picture is much more impressive than before. I show one book by a favorite author -- I can't remember who -- , holding it up to the camera for all to see. In it is a bibliography, which I read aloud. As I read each new book's title, I hold up that book, and its front jacket appears on the huge screen above. Every book is more obscure, and harder to find, than the previous one. These books are precious and meaningful to me, but I wonder whether I am getting through to the audience. (199 words)

I am sitting at the lunch table with my group from work, and somehow the subject of English girls has come up in the conversation. "I think they're cute", I say. "Are you kidding?", answers X. (a male co-worker) in disbelief. "No.", I reply, "They [the English] have a lot of charm and style." Y. (another male co-worker, who is French) is also at the table, and he suggests, "Yes, but what about the French?" "Have you met the new English post-doc joining our collaboration?", I ask them, adding that, "Her name is Z." Suddenly we are all outdoors and Z. appears. She races across a street in a car or some other vehicle. The vehicle crashes into the glass of a shop window and she falls out of the car and lies on the sidewalk. Seeing this, I run down the street to help her. "I'm okay", she reassures me when I reach her side. Not believing this entirely, I examine her head to find it covered with fine shrapnel of glass. I wipe some blood from her forehead with my handkerchief, but she doesn't seem to be too badly injured. (190 words)

I am outdoors in a town square. Someone tells me that there is something for me at the nearby window of a large public building -- is it the Post Office? I go there and am handed a calico cat which is the color and size of my pet A. "That's my cat", I say, and I am a little surprised. I start the voyage home with her. Somehow this involves a stop at my office at work. X. (a male co-worker) comes in and sees the cat in a carry case on the office floor. "Close the door", I say. He does this and then asks, "Does she roll around the floor [in the cage]?" "This isn't a hampster in a wheel", I answer, expecting him to know better. Then I arrive at my home with the cat, only to find that A. is already there waiting for me. "Oh, this is another cat", I realize. I put the two cats together on the living room floor to play. They look very similar, and I think to myself, "I guess I now have two cats." The new cat, however, frightens A., and A. stays away. I pick up the new one and hold her in my arms. Suddenly I notice for the first time that despite her beautiful fur, her mouth is ugly and has big teeth, reminding me somehow of a racoon. "I'll call you 'Coon'", I decide. Now Coon walks around the living room while A. sleeps. A. begins to shake and twitch in her sleep, and I realize that she is having a disturbed dream -- a nightmare? -- about being bullied by the new cat. She wakes up with a start, looks around for Coon, and moves away from her. (293 words)

A competition is being held for the purpose of determining who can break or shatter glass into the most beautiful geometric pattern. One of the contestants, a young boy, walks up on the stage and prepares to break a plane of glass standing beside him. For dramatic effect, he plays a musical flourish on a harmonica. Somehow the harmonica, which is tied to a string hanging from the ceiling, slips out of his control. The harmonica swings like a pendulum and strikes the pane of glass, much to the boy's horror. But the outcome of this accident is lucky, for the pane breaks first into four perfect quarters, followed by each quarter breaking into three pieces of equal size. The audience gasps in awe at this presumably winning entry in the competition. (132 words)

I am in Geneva, Switzerland, for a short period of time. While I am there I meet a girl who is short, has black hair as well as a somewhat sarcastic sense of humor, and is very lively. We wander about the city streets doing fun things while she makes wisecracks. Then we come across an outdoor cafe which is on a patio one story below street level. We go down the stairs and eat dinner there. Suddenly it is my last night before going back to the U.S., and she comes back with me to the hotel where I am staying. We get into bed for the night but my mother is there too. I have my arm around the new girlfriend, but I feel uncomfortable about this with my mother watching. I get up and walk into the bathroom. Mother also comes in and she says to me, "Everything would be okay if she [the girlfriend] weren't here." She then returns to the bedroom. Thinking about my mother's remark, I say to myself ironically, "That's what I was thinking about her." [I.e., that's what I was thinking about my mother.] (181 words)

I dreamed that I was at a public affair but I don't know which affair it was although it was outdoors. There were many people around us and they were of all ages. I was at this affair with B. He is about twenty-six years old and he is the boy-friend of one of the girls that lives in the dormitory that I do. Whenever I felt the urge to get away from my escort or from the people at the affair, I would start to fly. (like superman). While up in the air I felt very uneasy and worried about how I would get back down without hurting myself. I left my escort about three times in this way. I do not remember why I felt that I had to get away.
Interpretation
I do not know why I would dream of B. I do not know him very well and I do not feel very friendly toward him when I do see him. I believe that I associated him with my studies and felt that I had to get away for a short while. When I had this dream, I hadn't been home for about eight weeks and was looking forward to going home. I felt that I wanted a short vacation from my studies and this dream was an escape mechanism in the form of a fantasy to get away from my classes for a short while.

I dreamed that I was in the office of the directress or nurses in the nursing school. She is about forty-five years old. She told me the results of an I.Q. test which I had taken in a psychology class. [I really did not take this test.] The I.Q. for this test was 169. She told me that my I.Q. for the test I had taken in the nursing school was only 80. She said that if I had made a higher score in the nursing test I would have received more credit hours for the training that I received from my hospital at home. [I did take a nursing pre-entrance examination. This test determines the number of credit hours that a nurse receives for her student training when she enters the graduate school.]
Interpretation
This dream is probably a form of wishful thinking. I would like to receive as many credits as possible for my student training. I did not know the results of the examination at the time of the dream. I had been thinking about the examination that day and I wanted to know about the results of the test.

I was in a room [The room is vague. It was probably my own room.] telling a friend [girl-friend about twenty-five years old] that I could get eagle stamps for 1/2 value of my purchase. I had previously read in a newspaper that you do not receive any value for eagle stamps if you have a charge account at this store.

I think that this dream was a form of wishful thinking. Since I save eagle stamps, I would like to receive full value for my purchases so that I can save more stamps.

I was sitting in my room reading the newspaper that I get from my home-town. I noticed a picture of my girl friend, A. from home. A. is twenty-four-years-old. She is one of my closest friends. Her picture was in the society section. She was dressed in a bridal gown and veil. Her picture was above the picture of her brother's bride-to-be who is about twenty-two-years-old. She was also dressed in a bridal gown and veil.
As I was reading the reviews of the wedding, I felt very unhappy because I hadn't been home to attend the wedding. I thought that the wedding was to take place a week later than it did. In the lower left hand corner of the page was another picture of A. and this picture was tinted. It was the same pose as the one above it. I couldn't understand why A. was wearing such an outfit. Neither could I understand why there were two pictures of A. in the paper.

Interpretation
I am looking forward to going home for the wedding of my girl-friend A. 's brother. He is going to be married November 15, 1947. I haven't been home for about six-weeks, so I am getting anxious to see my family and also A. and her family. I was thinking about the wedding the day that I had this dream. The dream itself is a bit confusing. I do not know why I dreamed that A.'s picture would be in the paper in two places on the same page. Perhaps the two pictures were just an emphasis of the fact that the wedding is associated with A. I know that she is going to be in the wedding party.

Answers to questions
2. Confused--couldn't understand why the two pictures of A. in the paper. Unhappy--because I had missed the wedding.
3. Actual participant. I was reading the paper.
4. Unpleasant
5. My room.

I dreamed that I had a date with one of the younger doctors (age approximately thirty three) on the staff at the hospital in my hometown. I was very happy when I met him at the door. He came in and we sat down and talked for a while. We discussed some of the patients that he had on the floor on which I was working & we decided to go dancing that evening. Then we started out to go dancing.
Interpretation
During my Xmas vacation I had been working at the hospital at home. I have known this doctor for a while and he is happily married. We are good friends. I think that I recognize in him certain qualities that I like in men. This was a form of wishful thinking. I would like to meet someone who has qualities similar to those of this man.

I dreamed that I was a guide at one of the parks here in C. I am not familiar with the park but I remember that I was directing people in the park to follow a sidewalk which would lead them to a voting booth. (Primary election this fall). There was a sign nearby that had bold red and white letters on it that said "VOTE FOR NUESS..." (or Neff...). I walked a little way with a lady about 50 yrs. of Age--no one that I knew--and then came back to my "post." There were a few other people of all ages in my dream but the lady I mentioned is the only distinct person that I remember. I didn't see the booth in the park but I felt as though there was one at the end of the walk. I remember that it way daytime and the sun was shining.
Interpretation
I do not know the candidate's name but he was running for mayor in the primaries this fall. (Here in C.) I had seen a man, the day of my dream, standing in front of a building, where voting was taking place, and he had a sign "Vote for Nuess... (or Neff...). I can't imagine why I would be doing anything for the election. I never have had anything to do with elections at any time. I think it was a dream that I dreamed because of a visual sensation I had the day before my dream.

I was in charge of a floor in our hospital in M. One of the nurses that was working on the floor was very untidy about the appearance of her hair. I remember that it was my duty to tell her that she must do something to her hair so that it would be tidier and neater. The other nurse is about my age - maybe younger. I told her about her hair and then the dream was gone.
Interpretation
I do not know why I dreamed this dream. The other nurse in my dream is not a nurse in "real life" but an X-Ray technician. I may have been conscious of my own hair being stringy the day before I had this dream. I did not think it unusual to be in charge of the floor at home because I had been in charge of the floor before I came here for p.g. work at W.R.U.

I dreamed that I went to take an examination and I was late for the class. There were ten minutes left in the period and the teacher was one that I had for an English course last term. The teacher told me that I should take the examdnation and to write as quickly as possible so that I could get some credit. I took a seat and was unable to find my pen. I looked through my purse frantically and finally found the pen, but it didn't have any ink in it. I got some ink from the desk and then I couldn't find my blue book. I just had a few minutes left when I did find the book so I quickly wrote out the answer to the first question. Then the bell rang. When I handed in my book, I felt that I had failed the examination.
Interpretation
I had been reviewing for a chemistry examination the day that I had this dream. I reviewed all the material that I could and I still felt rather insecure about the material that I had studied. I believe that I felt that I wasn't very well prepared to take the examination. This dream was probably just a continuation of this feeling.

I dreamed that I was trying to swim in a huge swimming pool that had no water. The fact that there wasn't any water in the pool did not hinder my activity. The pool was built at a 45 degree angle. I was swimming downward instead of upward. My actions were deliberate and I did not feel any anxiety while I was swimming. I remember very clearly that I was swimming downward and that I was slightly confused about the thought that I had to get back up to the top of the pool. There was a very short interval of the dream that I do not remember, but I do know that in some way or another I did get back to the top of the pool and I started to swim down again. (I did this twice.)
Interpretation
I am not a good swimmer but I do go swimming now and then to try to improve my strokes, etc. I think that I associated the swimming with two of my classes that I am taking at the present time. The day before I had the dream, I felt that these two subjects were "pulling me down" and I was swamped with work in these two classes. Perhaps the pool without the water was a symbol for the lack of background in these two subjects which I felt so concerned about at the time of the dream.

I dreamed that I was in one of my classes and we had just received the results of an examination we had taken about a week ago. I looked at my grade and it was marked "90 - 30, grade 60". I asked the teacher why I had thirty points taken off of my grade, and she said, ~You used a blue book that had notes in the back of it." I looked over the book and showed her that the notes were pertaining to another course. She said that she would give me the original grade but I should be careful of this in the future. My teacher was a lady about 40-45 years of age.
Interpretation
I was anxious to know the results of the test; I wanted to know the grade that I had made. I had to borrow a blue book before I could take the examination, because I had forgotten to bring a book to class. Before I had started to take the test, one of the girls asked me what time it was According to the M___ Code of honor, no talking should be done before, after, or during a test, while the girls are in the room taking a test. I thought that perhaps someone would think that we were discussing the test, and may have reported us. The above dream was a result of the anxiety that I had over the results of the test that I had taken about a week before the dream.

Answers to questions
2. Happy, about the grade of 90. Frustrated about the grade of 60.
3. actual participant
4. unpleasant
5. Classroom.
6. No.
7. Yellow book for the test.

I was shopping in a large department store. I was looking for something very definite, but I wasn't sure of where it was, or what it was. I had to go to another floor, but I was afraid to get on the escalator because it was going so fast. Finally I steeled myself and forced myself to get aboard the conveyance. I was terrified going up at this break-neck speed. Finally I reached the floor above only to find that what I wanted was in reality downstairs. I was distressed at having to go down again, and confused by the milling crowds. Finally, I managed to get away from the crowd back into a deserted dingy corner where a dingy elevator was. I waited for it to come up with some misgivings, because I recalled similar experiences, from other dream situations, in which the elevator fell or went down too fast and made my stomach feel awful. But I had to get downstairs, and this elevator seemed the only way at the moment. I got in when it came and had the same feeling of inexplainable terror as we descended. It did go too fast, but it didn't fall completely out of control as I had feared, and on the whole wasn't half so bad as I'd anticipated. I felt relieved when I got out.
Interpretation
This dream, in slightly varying form of detail, has recurred to me at increasingly lengthening intervals ever since I can remember. At times, especially when I was younger, it was my mother I was looking for, and I was terrified because I was lost and separated from her. At other times, we were together, and I was afraid of the escalator or the elevator. I can't think of any reason for these dreams unless it is an insecurity I have always felt in my home life. I'm not sure, but it may be that I have this dream after my parents have had a serious argument.

My mother, father, older sister, and I were at a riding academy, negotiating with the elderly farmer and his wife for pony rides. There were several very small ponies grazing nearby, some brown and white and one black and white. As soon as I saw the black and white one, I was very excited and anxious to ride that one. The farmer remarked that we women were wearing dresses, and offered to wash out some old slacks for us to wear. We were reluctant at first, but the wife was so anxious to have us do so that we must finally have agreed. She smiled almost fixedly at us, and I was fascinated by her shiny face and her literally apple-like cheeks, very round and brilliantly red. Then we were riding horses under an archway past the stables. This scene seemed familiar to me. I think I have dreamed this same riding scene before.
Next we were staying at the farmhouse which seemed to be a winter sports lodge. Somehow it fell to my lot to investigate some sort of crimes going on in the lodge. It was extremely dangerous and I felt as though I were constantly in peril. During the course of the investigation, my companion, (I think it was a girl about my own age who was supposed to be a friend of mine, but I can't identify her), and I discovered several human bodies lying on a wide ice-filled ledge jutting from a wall in the basement. I was surprised and a little repulsed at seeing my aged grandfather's body among those there. The arms and legs seem to have been cut off and were wrapped with the rest of the body in a great deal of grayish gauze with only the head protruding. My companion found a female relative of hers there, too, and expressed the same feelings I had. I was puzzled as to how they got my grandfather's body there, since he died and was buried last April.

In the next scene I was in a bedroom searching for "evidence" but I don't know what. My companion was with me but I had the feeling she was either not on my side, or just not of any help to me. Just as I was coming out of the room, hurriedly to escape detection, the two occupants came back. They passed me coming out of their room as they went in, but paid no attention to me, as though it were quite natural for me to be there. I was greatly relieved. One of the men was a large, heavy Englishman, slightly more than middle age, and the other, whom I knew to be the brains of the outfit, was the Mickey Rooney type. Somehow, I knew that he was 18 years old. He was very handsome and attractively dressed in light clothes.

In the next scene I discovered the secret. My companion and I were crouching outside the basement window, peering into a large room with rows of tables. Many men worked there, each at his own table, assembling parts of dismembered bodies, and applying make-up to them to prepare them for display. On each table were piled arms, legs, thumbs, and bodies in various degrees of dismemberment. I was at once fascinated and horrified at what I saw, but satisfied with the "solution."

Interpretation
I can't imagine anything more like a radio mystery story. Since these are my favorite radio diet, the dream may mean that I closely identify myself with the heroic radio detectives. I got great satisfaction out of my role in this dream. I was the "big deal." There were many people relying on me, it seemed. I was participating in the kind of excitement I never could find in real life, and when I awoke I felt very relaxed and pleased.

Answers to questions
2. At various times in the dream I explained being:--excited, anxious, fascinated, surprised, repulsed, puzzled, relieved, horrified.
3. Participant
4. Both
5. Inside and outside a winter sports lodge
6. No, except one portion in the beginning which I explained as seeming to me to have been a part of other dreams I have had from time to time.
7. I was very conscious with the intense red of the farmer woman's cheeks. I never remember having been conscious of color in any dream before.

It seems there was some sort of University rally at M--A. building. All the boys and girls were supposed to parade through the building. Before the rally got to the building, several other girls and I went up to the third floor of M-- to explore. It seems we weren't supposed to go up there, according to the rules. We were very surprised to find that the teachers had their offices there. The hall was lined with shelves of books, something on the order of the arrangement of the second floor of the wing. I took several books off a table to put them on the shelf I knew belonged to this particular teacher. (Each teacher had a section where she kept her books.) Just as I was putting the books on the shelf, I noticed that a door at the end of the corridor was ajar and Miss K-- was sitting at her desk, looking at me. "Those aren't her books. They're mine!" she said crossly. I quickly put the books back down, and thought I better get away from there before she realized I was there against the rules, and I got into trouble.
The girls with me weren't very important in the dream. About this time, they dropped out of the action. I didn't want to get caught in the rally crowd, for some reason or other. I heard them coming up to the third floor so I thought I would hurry and get down the back way before they got upstairs. There were several stairways at intervals in the hall, and from where I stood, sort of in the middle, I could see them all. People were beginning to come up the stairway I had wanted to escape down. I ran to one of the others, and the same mob was already surging up there, too. It was the same with all the stairways, and by the time I had discovered this it was too late to get away at all, so with a resigned feeling of disgust I allowed myself to be swept along for a ways. It seemed to be a square hall, and we went all around it and then we were to go back downstairs again. As we reached the stairway, I noticed that just at the head of it there was a bathroom. I felt that this was my chance to escape so I ducked in there without anyone seeing me. There was a combination of a clothes chute, dumb waiter, and spiral stairway in the bathroom which I thought it would be a cinch to use for escape.

It was up quite high from the floor and with some difficulty I managed to get my legs into it in preparation to descend. Then it seemed as though it was smaller in diameter than I had first thought it to be, and higher from the floor. I felt trapped. I couldn't get down through the tube, whatever it was, and I was stuck so that I couldn't get back down to the floor. I was getting worried and was trying to think of some way I could get down through that opening. Then all of a sudden I could get out quite easily, and I found, looking down, that from my position I could easily and safely jump to the floor. I was greatly relieved and I jumped down and all my problems seemed to have been solved.

Interpretation
My situation of being stuck and having several alternatives, not knowing what to do reminds me of the situation I was in the evening before I had the dream. I came home in quite a confused mood after being almost stranded in a strange neighborhood, trying to call a cab from a neighborhood bar and being stopped in my purpose by a local hoodlum, and finally a male and a female friend of mine showing up with a car and taking me home. I was quite upset when I went to bed, and I think this may account, in part for the dream.

2. I was surprised to find teachers offices there, a little frightened at Miss K--, disappointed & disgusted at being caught in the rally, frightened and frustrated in the chute, relieved when I got out safely.
3. Participant
4. Unpleasant
5. M-- A-- building, the non-existent "third floor," and a bathroom there.
6. I have dreamed being caught in similar predicaments, and some scenes in those halls I know have been present in other dreams, but the plot of the dream this time was new.
7. I was definitely conscious of an unusually large number of red sweaters and jackets on the students as I saw them surge to the top of the stairs.

I walked into a tiny picturesque blacksmith shop and there, at a large table, the blacksmith and his wife were shoeing a tiny white donkey. I knew it was a donkey although it was no bigger than a fox terrier. It was lying flattened on its stomach, front legs out front, hind legs out back. The blacksmith's wife was holding his head while the blacksmith held one dainty hind foot between his thumb and forefinger and filed the shoe around the edges. I talked to them, and noticed that the blacksmith had a handful of tiny horse shoes similar in size and shape to copper pennies with a horseshoe-shaped rim around them. Then I saw a rather large two-wheeled cart standing next to the donkey. "Does he really pull that?" I asked, and they answered proudly, "Oh, yes, all the time." I felt sorry for him, having to pull such a large wagon, but I just said, "Isn't that remarkable."
The blacksmith was very nice. He led me into the adjoining barn where there were larger white donkeys, saying, ''I'll tell you the story about why these white donkeys wear shoes." The barn was sweet and pleasant, and the animals had very human expressions on their faces. I had a very comfortable feeling of being glad to be there hearing the story. I felt as though I had gone back to live in a fairy tale. The story started to be very interesting. It would have been a wonderful story, I am sure if I could have heard it. Just as it was begun, however, my mother was waking me up. I was very disappointed at having to awaken.

Interpretation
One of my friends who helps keep me supplied with dreams was telling me her dream about a tiny horse the day before I had this dream. It struck us both as very funny as she told it, and we laughed a good deal about it. This may have had something to do with why I dreamed about a miniature donkey. I can't think of any other explanation.

Joe Louis was at my house. It seemed as though he was playing an engagement here as a trumpet player. He sat in a familiar chair in my living room and played hot trumpet music. Our front door was open and there were a great many people on the front porch and in the front yard who had come to see and hear him. I sat opposite him and became more and more interested in him. I decided that, since there was some place I had to go after his performance, I'd promote things so that he'd take me. He kept looking my way and smiling and I felt greatly encouraged. All of a sudden a young colored girl hurried through the room and upstairs to remove her hat and coat, casting a coy glance at Joe as she passed. I wondered whether it was his wife or his girl. He turned to me and said, half to me, half as though he were talking to himself, "At last she came to see me! I didn't think she would, she hasn't come for so many of my shows, but now she's here!" I looked at hlm and saw that his eyes were brimming with tears. I was very surprised to see evidences of such deep emotion, and also considerably crestfallen because that ended my chances.
Interpretation
My girl friend and I had previously been discussing race relations. She is taking a sociology course concerning the Negro, and we had considered gleefully the sensation we would create among some other of our friends if we should take to dating Negro men. When I was plotting in my dream, I was delighted with the prospect that I would be able to call my friend and tell her that I had been the first to date a Negro.

I was with my family and some friends in a car parked across the street from the little church I used to attend. We had been somewhere and were on the way home, but why we parked there, I don't know. The general atmosphere in the car seemed to be strictly inharmonious. I was out of sorts because I was the only one there without a date, and I sat slouched down in the corner of the front seat. My mother, father, older sister were there, together with several couples of my friends whom I am unable to identify. It seems there were some dishes down in our church basement which I had mentioned a dislike for at one time. I had mentioned this unthinkingly in a casual manner to a character with whom I had gone out several times. He is a couple of years older than I am and has a friend of the same age who acts as his stooge, humoring along his boorish tendencies, and laughing at his jokes: generally, stooging for him, although he's a little less ignorant. All of a sudden, I saw this fellow, together with his stooge and the latter's wife (he's not married really, and the man in the dream didn't look like him, but I knew it was he), come out of the church basement carrying piles of these dishes and laughing loudly and hysterically. They crossed the street and came over in front of our car. Then my "friend" started to put on his act. He would hold out a dish at arm's length and with a deliberate gesture, drop it on the ground and let it break. He had different ways of breaking them. Some he dropped in this fashion and others he crushed in his hands, still others he tossed in fancy ways before he let them break. I was utterly revolted that he could think up such a thoroughly stupid thing to do. I was completely disgusted, and tried to pretend that I didn't see him so that he would go away. I think the other people in the car were amused, and laughed every once in a while. He laughed hysterically as he performed, calling, "Look -- look!" I slouched down further in the corner of the seat, but I couldn't help smiling every once in a while. I don't know why because I certainly didn't think he was funny.
Interpretation
Although I have dated this man several times, I think he is an utter character. I spend my time avoiding him now. This act I dreamed of his putting on is just the sort of thing he would really do to attract my attention, or try to get my favor. I have a few facts that might in some way explain the dream. One, he is of a radically different religion from mine, and we don't see eye to eye at all on this score. This may have something to do with the setting of the dream near the church. One time when I was with him, I casually admired a lovely cigarette ease in a jewelry store window, and he went down and bought it the next day for me. This case reminds me of the casual mention of not liking the dishes prompting him to break them all to win my favor. Then, of course, there is Freud's interpretation of breaking dishes. I find it rather difficult to apply this to my dream, however.

I had some sort of report that it was very important for me to give to our family doctor, an elderly man whom, incidentally, I do not like. I looked out of the living room window and saw him driving slowly by in a car with two other people, a man and a woman. I ran out to him with several papers (my report--it seemed as though it was some sort of progress report on my own condition) in my hand and caught up with him a few doors down the street. I felt very kindly toward him, and very glad to see him, just the opposite as I should feel in real life. The man with him in the car was a man who lives in my neighborhood and whom I have seen many times, but whom I do not know by name. He is older than I am, but I do not think he is thirty yet. The woman was no one I knew, and she was not familiar to me in the dream. It seemed as though the man knew me very well, but I was quite surprised to find him so cordial and interested in me when I didn't even know his name. He sat very close to the old lady with him, and once said something affectionate to her and kissed her, at which she giggled. At first, I thought this most unusual that so young a man should be with an old woman, but no more I had thought that when I "realized" that it must be his mother. I was very satisfied with that explanation. Then the doctor started to drive the car in the opposite direction from where it had been facing, and about two doors down from my house on the other side, I saw several people coming out. First, was a girl whom I recognized as a girl I went to junior high school with, who had been a very good friend of mine. It didn't look like her, but I knew that it was she. Then a young man came out, following her to the car, and I thought he looked vaguely familiar, concluding that it was J--, the boy L-- had a crush on in Junior high school. I wondered whether she had finally been successful in winning him, and projecting forward in some way, asked someone later about it who told me that they were now married, after many troubles and separations. I felt very pleased about this, and remarked about it to my companions. I felt as though my faith had been restored in human nature.
Interpretation
Free associating, I can get a few ideas. The man in the car was blond, as was a man I had a date with Thurs. Having a reputation of a cynic, his liking me was a great surprise to me. Ages and birthdays came into our conversation, and I found I was 2 months older than he. That may explain the old woman and young man. I can also tie in the thought of finding something finally after trials and tribulations, as L-- did in the dream. In connection with the first thought, I might mention that I knew this date of mine previously, but had never dated him before. When I really talked to him, I found that he was a very different person from what I had assumed him to be after taking in all the things I had heard about his cold cynicism. The more I free-associate, the more I feel that this explanation has much to do with the dream.

Answers to questions
2. Puzzled at friendliness of man. Surprised at his being with old woman. Pleased and happy at L--'s happiness.

College women, late 1940s:#0018 (Code 002, Age 21, 04/23/48)

I was coming home from work with two people. One was an older woman whom I believe is somewhere in her fifties, a very active person who, somehow, always seems to me much like my mother. The other person seemed to have been another of my co-workers (the older woman being a woman with whom I work at a department store), although I never did actually establish who it was. It seems to me as though it was supposed to be a boy acquaintance of mine, someone with whom I used to go to school a number of years ago and whom I haven't seen for several months because of the fact that he is in the navy. He is about six months younger than I am. As we came out of the store I was aware of the definite need not to look directly at this third person. I thought, "I don't want to give him the satisfaction that I am being eager." When we got outside, we boarded a conveyance: a sort of flat cart on wheels drawn by a horse and driven by a coachman seated high in front. The older woman and I got on one side, and the other person, who I almost subconsciously sensed to be this boy, got on the other side, with his back to ours. I again was very careful not to turn around so that he wouldn't think that I was looking at him. I thought, "It certainly will be wonderful to tell everyone when I get home that I actually rode in one of these things." For this brief instant it seemed that we were in a strange city or country. Then I began to feel uneasy about getting home. We had to sit very carefully so that we didn't get jarred off the cart as it bumped down a steep hill. All of a sudden the woman jumped off, saying, "Oh, my goodness I must have forgotten my glasses. I'll have to go back to get them I can't see a thing without them." And she began to search through her pockets in a distressed manner while following the slowly moving cart down the street. I had a sinking feeling at the thought of having to turn back to retrieve the glasses, and sort of hoped that she would go back alone if she had to get them. But she didn't--she was running along behind, trying to catch up with the wagon, although it was going very slowly. Incidentally, I'm sure she had her glasses on, I remember noticing them, but just didn't feel like telling her, I guess. I figured if she said she forgot them, then she did. Another thing I remember was wondering, shortly after we got on, how we would manage the matter of the fare--concluding that we would undoubtedly each pay a part of it.
Interpretation
I can't offer any interpretation for this dream. I an of the opinion, however, that these people are really supposed to stand for others, because of their remoteness to me. I have no particularly strong relationship to either of them, and seldom do they cross my conscious mind.

We were at a large gathering. It may have been lunch time at school, but it seemed to be more of a party. I guess just about all my girl friends were there. I recognized many of them, but I can't recall who most of them were. I don't remember whether there were any men present. One girl was walking around blinking her right eye and looking quite miserable. I recognized her as a girl whom we try to escape at lunch every day at school. She's quite repulsive, and none of the girls care to have much to do with her. In my dream, no one was paying any attention to her as usual. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she'd had something in her eyes for days. She was working at it with a bobby pin and I immediately realized this was very unsanitary, so I offered to get it out for her. I pulled down the lower lid and saw a tiny black speck in the corner of the eye. I decided first I'd need a toothpick, but thought, but there aren't any around here, with a feeling almost of panic. Then I remembered having seen some somewhere, and found them in a very unusual place, on a shelf where I would never expect to find them. They seemed to pop up there just because I needed them. I had the feeling that I was very triumphant. I felt almost as though I had worked magic. I took several out of the box they were in, and put one in my mouth because I felt that after all, that was where toothpicks belonged. Next, I needed some cotton, and that turned up in much the same way as the toothpicks had. I felt the same way about finding that. I also felt pleased with myself because I was being so benevolent to this character. I didn't waste any love on her, to be sure, but I felt that I was at least doing my moral duty which was more than any of the other girls were doing.
Interpretation
I can't offer any interpretation, because I can't think of any possible connections between the dream and anything which happened on the previous day or any other time. It seemed so unimportant a dream that I suppose it had a very deep meaning.

I was at a party given by a club of boys who are good friends of mine. Their parties are quite famous, and so are they personally, as definitely extra-special. I met them almost two years ago, about four months before I broke up with my "steady", and after that, I began to be considered as part of the club's gang of boys and girls. All the boys were at the party in my dream, and all their regular girls whom I know so well. I was having a wonderful time, and felt so happy as to be almost floating on air. All of a sudden, in a very natural way as though it weren't unusual, in walked my "ex". I was so happy to see him that I almost ran up to him and threw my arms around him. But I didn't. I greeted him and felt gratified that he was very friendly and held no grudge. (This would be very unlike him in real life, I'm afraid.) We sat down together on a davenport in the middle of the long, smoke-dimmed room. Just before he ("Ex) came in, the boy who brought me to the party left with his best friend, also a member of the club and a good friend of mine. They were going out to buy more supplies for the party. The fact that my date would come back and find me with this strange man didn't seem to worry me at all. All I could think about was how happy I was that he had come to the party. I was just dying to introduce him to all of the people there. I said, "I'm so glad you've come back, because now you can meet all my wonderful new friends, and I can share them and these good times with you." Then I thought I'd better ask him how he happened to come there. He held my hand and looked seriously into my eyes and said simply, "I came back because I still love you." I was so thrilled and so completely happy that I woke up.
Interpretation
This sounds like wish-fulfillment to me. I have thought so many times since I have met the club how much he would enjoy the people. At times I have thought, "I'm having such a good time at this party (or picnic) but it needs only one thing to make it perfect--". In my dream I got the one thing that made everything perfect.

My girl friend came over with a mutual friend of ours, a boy whom I have dated off and on for over a year and who I met through her. They disclosed to my slyly that the time had now come for me to meet "the real John Doe" (the boy). I was mildly surprised to learn that this boy whom I had thought I knew so well was only taking the part of the real one. I was mildly interested in knowing what the "real John Doe" was like. At no time were my emotions about any of this very strong. I was only mildly affected by the strange happenings. On the way to the Real John Doe's house they told me that I would like the real one much better. Finally, we arrived and went down to the basement where he had his darkroom. The boy I know is very interested in photography, and the scene was familiar to me as being in his home and just the way we have gone down to inspect his darkroom in real life. When we got down into the basement, there was this "real John Doe" absorbed in his photography work. The one whom I had known as John said dramatically to me, "THIS---is the Real John Doe!" We said "how-do-you-do?" and he immediately began to tell me why his identity had been hidden from me. I thought it was all very nice, but it didn't surprise me that the real John expected the false John to do a fadeout. No one seemed to be surprised by anything. The real John had some of the same physical characteristics as the one I had known, but there was no mistaking one for the other. The real one seemed to be milder and kinder and had the look about him that would make people say at first glance, "My, isn't he a nice boy!" That was how he differed from the false John.
Interpretation
This sounds very much like an actual experience changed around so that the main person is different. My girlfriend had a boyfriend whom He both admired because he was so different from other "angle boys". He was so completely unemotional for five months while dating her that we had begun to believe he was that way naturally. Then one day our faith in human nature was shattered. We found he was just the opposite of what we had believed him to be. We expressed this fact by saying that we had now an acquaintance with "the new -----. I had this dream right after our discovery, and it certainly all ties in.

I decided to get married so I did. That was just the way it happened, almost as though one minute I was single and the next married. Then I began to have qualms about what I had done so impetuously. I thought, "But I don't even know this man. Here we are married, I'll have to live with him the rest of my life, and what if I find out he's not what I want in a mate?" Then I thought, "I can get a quick divorce because we were just married, and no one need ever know". Then I decided nobly, "No, you've done this thing and it's up to you to make a go of it. In a few years you'll get acquainted and you can learn to love him". (Reminds me of the things I have read repeatedly in the lovelorn columns of the newspapers. That's usually the kind of advice they dole out.) Then the man came into the picture. He wasn't bad looking and seemed to be a nice enough person, although he doesn't remind me of anyone. I don't know how I happened to choose him to marry. He seemed almost to not even be aware of our marriage, and to care less. He took the attitude, "Well, we're married, and I suppose we'll have to stay that way--this is your show, so you call it. What do we do now?" That was beginning to worry me, too. I thought what will people say when they find out about this? They will expect us to act married, and I can't act married with this man I don't even know. I remember in the beginning of the dream noticing that I had on a cheap engagement ring. It was silver. I thought people might think it was platinum, but anyhow I was glad he had been nice enough to get a sterling silver one. It had been nice on his part since, of course, since he didn't particularly care for me he had not morally been obligated to do anything like that for me. Now the ring had become a plain wedding ring. I remember that we had a conversation concerning our situation. He smirked good-naturedly in an I-don't-care way, and let me know that if I wanted to act married, he'd go along with it, and if I didn't he didn't care either. I practiced calling him affectionate names like "honey", but I felt very foolish and uncomfortable doing it. He treated me in the same affectionate way. I was full of remorse for having been so eager, but I thought, well he's a good guy, maybe we can work it out.
Interpretation
Could be I have been thinking too much lately about getting married, and thinking about it in an entirely objective way, weighing this one against that one. After thinking such cold and calculating thoughts without a qualm, this dream may have come as a manifestation of my inner anxiety over such a course of action.

College women, late 1940s:#0023 (Code 007, Age 19, 02/14/48)

In my dream, I first saw a group of girls standing in front of a school building. One of the girls I recognized as a high school and church friend. She was laughing and singing along with the other girls, who were all standing in a circle. The group of girls stood there for a few minutes and then ran away from the building. I then entered a room in which sat my mother, sister, and her little boy. The little boy wanted to sit in a funny little round chair that was very dirty. I went over to a sewing basket and removed a cloth, with which to dust the chair. In the meantime the baby had gotten hold of a pair of scissors, and was cutting something. I took the scissors from him.
Interpretation
The first part of my dream probably is due to my constant thinking about school, especially now after have attended so many teas this last week, at which so many girls were present. I was recently speaking with the mother of the girlfriend I recognized in the dream. The little baby was probably my little nephew, who lives with us. I imagine it is the awareness of his mischievousness that led me to dream of him and his actions with the scissors.

I was sitting in a room surrounded by many people. Everyone seemed very excited and were all talking rapidly among each other. I was apparently surprised to see some of the people there. A man was there by the door, but he didn't say anything and didn't stay very long. I recognized many of the people as close relatives to me and my family.
Interpretation
I think this dream is a product of my thinking about my grandfather's death and funeral. Many of the people around me were older people, all of my grandfather's relatives. I imagine I was surprised at seeing some of them, because at the funeral there were many relatives from out of town that I hadn't seen for many years.

As I first remember the dream I was upstairs in a room with my sister-in-law, who is a nurse. I was mixing some blue chemicals. We were talking happily, next I was out in another room with my girlfriend from school. A teacher, whom I can't recall, was lining all the girls, (many of whom I recognized and spoke with) in a straight line to have their tonsils out. I stood in the line at first and then, finally remembering that I had had my tonsils out, I left with my girlfriend. We went downstairs and there in a little room off to one side, were a group of fellows singing and laughing. We stopped and talked with a few, and then we left.
Interpretation
I cannot interpret much meaning to this dream. I am taking chemistry at the present, and might be conscious of my sister-in-law, because she is a nurse and I am making my application now to send to a training hospital. I can't imagine how the tonsils fit into the dream, although it is true that mine are out.

I was at a summer resort. As I was going down the stairs into the beach, I saw on one part of this beach, huge cockroaches. I hurriedly ran past them and safely went into the water. There were many others in the water with me, and on the shore I saw a little dark-haired boy playing in the sand. To the left of me by the water was a public beach & many were swimming there in the water. Later I went into the house, where everyone was eating. A lady and her little baby were sitting with me. I noticed that there were little bugs around the table. Everyone seemed very happy.

I found myself in an apartment where I lived about twelve years of my life. Before I had a chance to look around, the landlady's daughter, 35 yrs., came out and hugged me. This part of my dream was peculiar, because during all the years we lived in that apartment, this lady never cared for me. She took me up to visit our old suite of rooms. In reality the rooms are quite small and plain. In my dream the rooms were spacious, light and beautifully furnished. The sun seemed to be streaming into all of the rooms. There was a lady in the rooms, whom I thought I recognized, but she wouldn't look at me, so I couldn't be sure.
Interpretation
For some time I have been hoping to get an apartment, and I think this dream represents that wish. It sees that even such an uninteresting place as that apartment was, it would probably look very inviting to me. I can't think of who the extra lady in the dream could be.

I found myself walking to a class with one of my former professors, a man in his late thirties or early forties. He was explaining that his class was being held in a large auditorium and that he was having some trouble with snakes in the room. We reached the building and I stood in the background while he opened the side door to see if the snakes were still there. At first nothing happened, but gradually snakes began appearing in increasing size and number. The next thing I remember, I was jumping from one table to another trying to escape snakes of all sizes, a good many of them very large. They were coming very close but apparently never reached me as I awakened with no particular feeling of anxiety. The only question left in my mind was how I got away.
Interpretation
The stimulation for dreaming of snakes may have come from a discussion the afternoon prior to the dream, in a C-- P--class. We were talking about establishing fear responses toward rats and. snakes. I have had a terrible fear of snakes ever since I read Ripling's story of the Cobra, prior to entering Junior High. I also listened to a friend describe South American snakes (last fall) and had all kinds of horrible visions of Boa Constrictors attacking travelers, etc. This is the only logical interpretation of this dream that I know of.

I was taking a F-- D--- exam when I happened to notice one of the boys in the class cheating. I went over to see what he was writing and noted that he was copying word for word the paper of the boy next to him. Knowing that a new rule had just been established that all cheaters were to be reported and that they would be suspended if proved guilty, I determined to turn the boy in. (I have never liked this boy, he is a pre-ministerial student at W-- and is always cheating in tests.) This seemed a good way to teach him a lesson so I typed up the report to hand to the Dean in the morning. The next day I couldn't bring myself to report him but had mentioned it to several people. By noon I heard that most of the class had been reported for a similar offense and everyone accused me of doing it. One of the girls included was a very good friend of mine and I was extremely upset to think that she would think I did it. When the dream ended I was still busy trying to clear myself of the implications.
Interpretation
The stimulus for this dream no doubt arose from an article I read that evening concerning scholastic cheating and the method of dealing with it which has been recommended, namely the honor system and ensuing reports, on all offenders. As I said the boy in question is a constant cheater and it irks me to think that he not only cheats but is going into the ministry on that basis. I dislike him and often wish he would be caught. I didn't turn in the report because I don't feel that that is the method of cure, and also because I never want to be known as a squealer.

When the dream began I was busy packing my clothes in the car to come home from College. I was solving the problem by carrying the whole dresser into the back seat of the car and then putting in the drawers which were packed with all my things. Later I went off to class, my last one in that school. It was on a second floor of what appeared to be a gym. One wall had large windows in it which were covered by newspapers. A young boy was busy stripping the papers off the windows and when gone we could see into the gym itself. Class was soon over and several of my very close friends and I went downstairs to have a cigarette and discuss the events to follow. It seemed that we were electing a queen for some affair and no one knew who it was. Several minutes later we ran up to the gym for the procession was to start. Elaine, a friend of mine and I were standing in good view of everything, right at the end of the aisle for the procession. The trumpets blew and I stood there eager]y trying to see who was the queen when a chorus of voices shouted my name. I was to have the honor because I was leaving for another school and they were showing me in this way what they thought of me. My surprise was immeasurable to say the least and I almost cried. The dream ended with Elaine walking me down the aisle to lead the procession.
Interpretation
Much of the material for my dreams of late has centered about the fact that I just left W. It's a time like that when you find out what people think of you, especially those who you consider your friends. I found out, when I was given a party just before leaving and it was very gratifying, to say the least. As far as the queen was concerned, we have been discussing that kind of thing as my sister has been up for a dance queen several times of late. Why I would identify myself with that kind of thing I don't know, except that I feel it would be quite an honor and would love it.

I dreamed that I was watching a group of boys in a large gym preparing for some game. In the center stood a boy whom I date quite a bit. I tried to wave at him but couldn't get his attention. From there the scene moved to a pool where a game was in progress. The object of the game was to jump in the water and pop balloons with a hammer. After watching this I dove into the pool. Shortly afterwards I noticed the pool was empty. The next time I went in there was water in it. Then I took a long run along the side and was in the air over the pool when I noticed it had been drained again. I righted myself and landed on my feet. I remember some feeling of embarrassment for having gone into an empty pool. As I was climbing out I started fussing with an ice cream push cart which had several bowls of sauces at one end. Somehow I upset the whole thing and several of us hurried out with it before the gym teacher came and found the mess. We took the cart outside once and tried to fix things up. The rest of the dream is quite hazy.
Interpretation
I don't find any reason for this dream. I like to swim quite a bit and make a habit of diving in and coming right out again. And I have often wondered what would happen if you did dive into an empty pool. As for the rest of it, I just have no idea how to explain it.

2. Gay and enjoyable.
3. I looked on until I began swimming too.

5. Gym, swimming pool (indoor), and the outside of a dormitory building.

7. Yes. I distinctly remember the bottom of the pool, when it was empty, was a rich shade of green.

I dreamed I was in N__ Y__ with my family. We were out at a big building which someone said was M-- S-- G--. It was dark green with the sides open and extended for miles. We stood beside it for a while and then got on the subway to go back to the center of town. The subway was run on the same principle as a roller coaster. We went on a level for a while and then zoomed up an incline. Every time we stopped I was tilted to the side. Finally we got off the "subway" and stood looking at a large wall map of C-- painted as a mural and put on a cement wall. From there the dream is a blur. I remember my Mother sat in the seat beside me, however, on this "subway", and my Father was in front.
Interpretation
I have never been to M-- S-- G-- so don't know what it does look like. It was built on somewhat the same principle as the C-- amphitheater. Don't know what the dreams mean.

I was dreaming about taking some sort of trip. I arranged 4 packs of cigarettes, Lucky Strikes, which were partially empty, each to different degrees, to divide my vacation into four parts. I gave them to someone, telling what date each stood for, I remember one that was for July 20, the other dates have faded. One pack was almost empty, having 4 or 5 cigarettes left. Transition here fades and I was then in a store trying to use a pack of tickets for a trip on some lake. The man I was talking to runs the soda fountain at the corner drug store. He told me that I must have 2 tickets next to each other on the ship with the number 34 at the bottom right hand corner of each one. The tickets were arranged with numbers much like on a calendar. I didn't find tickets arranged this way I only found one that had a 34 on the corner. Transition again fades and changes and I was on the edge of the lake. English professors began appearing, mostly ladies. They had dangling earrings, and once again numbers came into my dream. There was English 309 A, English 219, etc. and each one had a professor appearing for it. I was awakened at this point.
Interpretation
Much of this dream had faded. The great number of numbers appearing is interesting, but I cannot distinguish why. As a matter of fact, the whole symbolism of the dream is obscure to me.

I can't remember enough of the first part of the dream to record how I got there, but I found my self walking down a hallway, dimly lit, trying to get out of a saw mill I think it was. I tried first one door and then another that led off from the hall and each time I looked out to find a long drop to the earth below, thirty feet or so. Finally I returned to one door and then decided to descend by way of an unloading machine parked there. It had a series of wheels at one end, covered by huge rubber tires in groups of three's. By jumping from one set to another I was able to get down. Several men stood and watched my progress, I thanked them for letting me use the machine and then walked into a valley where I entered a hotel verandah. Here I found several friends (girls) of mine who asked me to stay a while, but not having been home for a while, I refused. I then found my self emerging on C-- H-- and started walking up F-- B-- to go home.

I dreamed there were hundreds of airplanes flying over our house, which was transferred into a new setting. I stood over a broad field to watch the planes. They were a very peculiar shape which I can't describe but can draw--. I guess I can't even do that but can still see them there in my minds eye. They were yellow and, black and flew en masse in a seemingly unending supply. I remember vaguely that a man jumped out of one of them and parachuted down to earth. I approached him when he landed. He stuck his foot through the silk and tore the chute badly. I think I contemplated that the material would have been nice for a nightgown or slip.
Interpretation
I think the shape of the planes was somewhat influenced by some pictures I saw very recently in Life of the new Navy or Army plane with the peculiar shape. I can't account for the dream however, aside from this.

I was lying on my stomach, dressed in blue jeans and a shirt in the hallway leading to the kitchen. The phone is in the hallway and I was with two others, a boy and another girl. The boy was on the phone and was blocking the way to the lavatory. I had an intense urge to defecate but felt considerable embarrassment in going into the bathroom at this time. Consequently, I held down my urge as long as possible, and then went into my pants. It was hard enough to remain intact and when I got up I went upstairs to dispose of it in the bathroom up there. The bathtub was full of water which somebody had left after bathing. 1 wanted to take a bath but felt that I needed clean water. The rest of the dream fades at this point. Somehow I took my bath and I believe I changed the water.
Interpretation
The defecation referred to is totally undisguised, obviously. I have found that just prior to my menstrual period I have a dream which is undisguised in a similar manner, although never before of defecation. Freud claims that dreaming of clothes means nakedness. This could be a possibility in this case because of the circumstances involved. The bath water is no doubt a leftover from two nights before when a friend of mine spent the night. We both wanted baths and while she was taking hers I considered the possibility of using her water in case the hot water was all gone. I did not do this however, as I would rather take a cold bath and feel cleaner.

2. Consternation over the defecation. Irritated at finding dirty bath water.

I dreamed I was back in W-- but the college was on the M-- campus. I drove up in front of a barber shop where the sidewalk curb had painted "student parking." I parked there and went into the barber shop. I almost walked into a stag room on my way past the door. Then I walked through a passage way and ended in a large stadium. I was with some girl of my own age (don't remember who) and we went up to the top of a flight of stairs and looked out over a vast stadium in which the M-- D-- festival was being enacted. This festival (in W--) is written by a student and is usually a take-off on some characters like "The Wizard of Oz" or "Mother Goose." There were many people dancing and running through their exercises. When we left there I took my little sister to the school bathroom. This was in Junior High School. I remember this because I had taken her to the boys bathroom. I can't remember what we did from there but we neither of us seemed too excited.
Interpretation
Just before I went to sleep I was thinking about the M-- D-- F-- and just what I could think up to write one myself. This I believe to be the basis for that part of the dream. As for the bathroom, we had discussed my father's mistake in going into the ladies' restroom one time when out of town that evening. This may be the foundation for that part of the dream.

I don't remember how I got where I was, but I was standing beside a lake wearing my sister's best black print dress. I wanted to get across to the other side of the lake and was marooned on an island of some kind. In order to get where my friends were it became necessary to swim across. The first part of the water I went into was thick with slime and muck. As I got toward the middle though the water was clearer and rinsed me clean. I was worried about ruining the dress, but when I came out of the water it seemed to be all right and somehow didn't stick to me.
Interpretation
The dirty lake was inspired by my thoughts of a similar nature about the pond where the canoe tilts were held. The dress is one I have worn on occasion and my sister had it on the day before the dream. The night I dreamed this, I had seen a movie short on a fisherman who was pulled under water and went walking about the lake floor seeing other people. I noticed that none of their clothes stuck to them, and remarked about it.

I dreamed I was going out to dinner and went with some of my college friends, girls. We ended up at a restaurant on the outskirts of some town. It had a brown stucco front and several archways going all across the front. Over each was the name of the seven dwarfs and Snow White. Then there were three more door ways, or arches with names over them, but I can't remember which ones they were. We went in and ordered steaks but L-- was the only one that could have one, the rest were all gone. The rest of this part of the dream is a bit vague. Shortly after, I returned to this same restaurant with the boy I used to go with. I went out to the kitchen this time and took a steak out of the icebox to cook it myself. After this the dream fades again, but every time I dream of this boy I get great feelings of antagonism toward him and have awful urges to hit him.

Snow White, etc., no doubt came from the pageant I saw this month for W-- M-- D--. The rest I can't seem to decipher. It was very dim and confused.

My husband (age 20 & really my husband) and I were watching a football game which was being played on the sandy beach of the lake. My mother and father were there too, sitting nearer the lake than we were. We left for a few minutes and when we got back there was nothing left of the football field, the football team, or the spectators. I was scared to death and finally saw a boy riding on a bicycle. I asked him what had happened and he said that a wave had washed everything away. I felt so badly because my mother and father were among the lost.

After the alarm clock rang, I apparently dozed off to sleep again and I remember hearing my father-in-law and the maid talking outside our door as to whether or not to call us. So, in a loud voice I yelled, "We're awake". When I actually did wake up, I asked my husband whether he heard me yell and he said he didn't. Neither were my father-in-law & the maid talking outside our door. It seemed so real, that it was hard to believe that it wasn't.

I was traveling somewhere by bicycle with several other girls and somehow I got separated from them -- it seems to me that people that knew me kept stopping me and asking me questions, thus detaining me from catching up with my friends. I remember riding up out a hill with a building on it and seeing a trail going into the woods. I started to ride onto this train but realized that it would soon be dark (it was 5:45) and I didn't want to be lost in the woods after dark - so I returned to the hill with a very frustrated feeling at having lost my friends. I remember having said "hello" to my sister as I was trying to catch up -- she didn't detain me, though.
Interpretation
I don't know why I was frustrated. The only sense I can get out of it is that I really am afraid of the dark but I love the woods in the daytime.

I cannot remember the details of the dream except that my mother had to go to jail for something that I knew she hadn't done. It was about 6 o'clock in the morning and she wanted to drive to jail alone but I insisted that I'd take her. She felt very badly about having to go to jail, and I tried to comfort her. When I went out to get the car, I couldn't back out of the driveway because a black car was parked horizontally across the driveway. I wasn't very worried about my mother having to go to jail because I was positive she was innocent.

I was at a big meeting of Catholics in a huge house in the country, and I didn't want to talk to so many people so I shut myself in a bedroom and took a nap. Then it seemed that people had been asking me for money for one thing and another until I had none left--I was mad about that. I went downstairs and on the way to the stairs I remember seeing a woman at a switchboard and a man on an elevator. When I got to the bottom of the stairs there were so many people there and when I saw my husband coming down the stairs, I decided to play games with him and hide. But he went home without me, and I started walking home on the country road in the dark. Finally, someone in a coach pulled by horses picked me up and it was raining. Then I woke up.
Interpretation
I interpret the idea of the Catholics taking my money as originating from my hearing older people talk of how much money the Catholic Church asks its members to give. Otherwise, I don't understand the dream, except that I often don't feel like mixing and talking with a lot of people.

My mother, father, sister and I went over to England where we had a big house with about 6 bedrooms. I started going around with Princess Elizabeth and since she was not supposed to associate with commoners, she had to sneak in and out whenever we were together. Then I met her brother, and we liked each other a lot. He wanted to marry me but I hadn't forgotten about my present husband back in the U.S. I don't remember, but I think we were engaged then. Anyway, I knew that if I married the Prince, he would be disliked by many and I would be in society for the rest of my life -- what happened, I don't know because I woke up. I remember talking to someone about the ocean trip -- I said that I hadn't gotten seasick on the large ship we sailed on -- this "someone" said she had sailed on a smaller ship and got terribly seasick. Also, I remember talking to several people about the food in England --I was shocked because I was getting plenty of food to eat and I had heard so many stories about the poor supply of food in England. Incidentally, I also remember telling someone in England that the Prince looked just like my husband fiance then) -- Also I hated to hurt my fiance and I thought that he might have been afraid of something like this happening when I left the U.S.

I was in a house with a lot of girls--it was on a main street where street cars ran. Across the street were four men and one of them knocked another one down and shot him. The men ran toward the house where we were and we were scared to death. Then two policemen were there protecting us from the bandits who had run around the house somewhere. The policemen had their pistols all ready to shoot if one of the bandits should appear. There was a street car waiting to leave right beside our house, but it wasn't going near my home. A friend of one of the girls picked her up, and I begged the girl to take me home but she wasn't going my way either. I kept trying to call my Dad to ask him to come after me. The policeman left and there were only two of we girls left in the house--we were afraid to go out on the street and wait for a street car for fear the men would return. There was a drunk under a back window of the house, and we hung out the window and tried to keep him quiet so he wouldn't attract the bandits attention to the house.

I was riding the streetcar, either with, or going to meet, my boyfriend, E--. (I can't remember which. It might have been both, at different points in the dream, which was very confused). Somehow, there were several children in the dream, not mine, but someone else's. I cant remember how they fit in.
Interpretation
I had just talked to E-- during the-day and made a date with him. Probably the streetcar was associated with him because that is our only means of transportation when we go out. The children might be an indication of my own desire to have children.

We were eating dinner at-the dormitory. The menu was baked beans mixed with spaghetti, cole slaw, and rolls. The waitress was giving out extra rolls, and gave three of the girls at our table four or five extra ones, putting them in their laps. The rest of us were angered at this, for that left only a few for the rest of us. When the plate was then passed to me, I took two rolls, feeling a little guilty but rationalizing by observing that they were small. Later, one of the girls who had received the extra rolls said that she didn't know why the waitress had given her so many, and that she didn't think she could eat them. We continued to eat the rest of the meal, and just as I was chewing the last mouthful, I woke up. Also, somewhere in the course of the dream, I was telling one of the persons on the news staff of the R-- how to go about chasing stories that hadn't come in by the deadline, I told this to him in greater detail than I remember thinking it out consciously.
Interpretation
The part of the dream about the R-- was probably brought on because I had been worried the day before as to how I could finish everything I had to do in the next few days, including quite a bit of work on the R--. The rest of the dream is meaningless to me.

We were eating at the dormitory, but instead of the housemother, my teacher from grade school (5-8 grades) was there. His son, a member of our young people's group at home and several other members of that group were also there. It was a large dinner. Chicken and spaghetti are the only two things I remember specifically, but there was much more. I had Just started to eat when I got up to get something for another girl. When I returned the waitress had taken my plate. I was very angry that the other girls hadn't prevented this, but was able to get more food. There was more to the dream but I can't remember it.

Interpretation
This dream seems to represent my own desires for marriage and sexual intercourse. I can't understand why I was wearing blue jeans. I had just had a date with E--, which probably precipitated the dream.

I was crossing a busy intersection and saw a little boy standing in the middle of the street. No one was paying any attention to him so I went over to him, asked him which way he was going, and carried him across the street in the direction he indicated. His parents were there. His mother took the boy and carried him. He was also leading a little girl by the hand. The father was impatient to get going and said something to the effect of "Come on, M--, we haven't got all day." Neither of them seemed concerned that their child had been in a dangerous situation.

Then somebody in the room started to throw a small rubber ball. Mr. R-- tried to get it but it was always thrown before he could get to it.

I was apparently visiting another college. I don't know which one or why. For some reason I was in one of the dormitories, trying to find out what the rules were regarding late nights. Nobody seemed to be around. Finally, I found a girl who was sleeping but who awakened as soon as I came into her room. I apologized for waking her and asked her about the late nights. I don't remember what her answer was, but somehow it came out that this dorm was named M. H., at which I was very pleased, since that is the dorm I live in. As I was leaving her room, I remembered that I had her scissors in my hand (I don't remember why). I took them back, assured her I hadn't meant to steal them, and went out.

I was driving a car along 105th Street and wanted to make a stop at the intersection so that my dad and mother could get in the car. I couldn't bring it to a stop however and had to go on through a red light. When I finally stopped at the next street, 3 men were near the car. They were all strangers to me and looked about 30 years old. There was a mutual attraction between one of the men (a blonde) and myself and somehow I felt I was in love with him. He offered to drive back a street for me. My parents came up to me to drive the car back but I told them to leave us and went with him. Later, when coming up my driveway, this man's wife came out of my house and on seeing me began screaming and having hallucinations that worms were on her. Her husband and I took her to the hospital and secretly I hoped she wouldn't get well so that her husband and I could be together but I also felt terrible at thinking these thoughts.
Interpretation
This could be an inner desire to meet a man with whom I immediately fall in love and don't have to develop this love. It seems too that I am not going to allow my parents to interfere as they might have done in the past. I am happier without them, in this dream. But probably I have the feeling that anything good that happens to me has its drawbacks for the wife enters. She either becomes ill at seeing her husband with me or else has been sick and that is why he goes out with others. I know I wish her to die and yet I try to hide these thoughts because actually she or any other wife has first choice to a husband. Somehow I feel I am the loser again.

Interpretation
I interpret this dream as referring to M-- and its sororities. The Sociology class to me stands for the Sorority system, and the steps which we climbed stands for the different Sorority functions we attended. Our not being able to decide which one to join may account for our not knowing where to turn or go in the dream.

There was a group of fellows and girls about 20 years of age. They seemed to be in a sort of church or temple among older men and women who were there to watch a ceremony of some sort. A man, who was the head of the place, came up to our group and without saying a work we knew it was our turn to die next. He took us downstairs to a small room in which there was a table, a mirror and some chairs. We asked for some leniency because of our young age. He said all right for a while. Then we found out we were already dead and, those upstairs were mourning for us and going through a ceremony. We still felt very much alive but somehow guilty and depressed. Later he came in again and told us our time was up and that we would have to be put in our coffins. I remember being transferred to New York with a boyfriend of mine, sitting in a sidewalk cafe with him but hearing no sounds and then being transferred back to the coffin.
Interpretation
It seems to me that this is some sort of a death wish either on my part or a wish that others would die. It also seems to give the idea of death being actually half-alive aware of what is going on but not being able to explain to the mourner.

There are two other girls I know who have gone with him in the past and have had the same outcome - when he feels both are getting too serious, he stops dating the girl because he can see himself with a girlfriend but not a wife.

A friend and I were driving in a car with a fellow we knew. He got out of the car to see about a new one. Next I found my uncle driving the car. He also got out to see about buying a new one. I took over the wheel. It started to rain. A colored family got in for they knew I was going in their direction. As I drove men kept popping up from man-holes and trying to attract my attention. I drove down the street and turned into a garage so as to make a turn. No one was in the car with me and I couldn't stop it except to put my foot out and stop it like I would a bicycle. I got out of the car and before I knew what was happening, some men came and drove the car down to a lower garage. I couldn't get the workers to return it to me for they were watching a clock and on the stroke of 5 p.m. they dashed out of the garage and left me all alone.
Interpretation
I had been driving with a friend and a fellow that day. He stopped all along the way to look at used and new cars.

I dreamt I was sitting in my living-room when a married girlfriend of mine came in with a date who was not her husband. She seemed very gay and happy and said she was going to go out with this fellow just as a lark.
Interpretation
This friend of mine married her husband after about a month. She wasn't in love with him at the time but talked herself into it because she felt there wouldn't be any men and she wanted to be married at the age of 20 in order to get ahead of a cousin of hers whom she didn't like. My feeling is that she is still not sure whether or not she did the right thing and would like to have a chance to go out with others to make sure she actually is happy with her husband.

Many people including my family and friends were sitting on very comfortable chairs and couches in a huge, beautiful room with columns and pillars all around the room. Straight ahead was a section with steps leading up to a space occupied by a very long desk. Seated at the desk was a man dressed in a judges' robes. A friend turned to me and told me to notice that the man in the judges' robes was a fellow I was dating. Then at the other end of the room music started playing. This fellow in the judges' robes came down, stood directly in front of me and asked me to dance with him.
Interpretation
I think the courtroom scene came to me because I was reading about the acquittal of 28 men who were accused of lynching a Negro in the South. The pillars and columns were a result of my taking an art appreciation course and having to notice such things. The fellow I dated dressed as a judge seemed to represent the idea that actually he is the one who has to make the decision as to whether or not he wants me and his asking me to dance represents the marriage proposal which unconsciously I want, I think.

It was about myself doing mathematical problems. It was on an examination. There were about 5 or 6 problems and I felt that if I was only able to do just a couple I would fail as there were only so few. Can't remember exactly what type of problems, but they seemed to be long involved ones where there was large amount of multiplying and dividing. I worked the first two or so out satisfactory, but then I wasn't able to do the rest. Could feel myself becoming anxious and tense. I looked at my watch, it was almost 3 o'clock. Class would be over soon and I had only done a few. In my dream I felt as if I was facing the same thing again, that is I could only go so far in some thing, but never completely work it through. Don't remember what happened from there, whether I handed the paper in or not. It did move out of the room. I was in a class room, to a place by myself - Cannot identify any other person.
Interpretation
While on duty in the hospital yesterday I had an occasion to work some dosage problems, However, I did work it out satisfactory, but only after a second attempt. Had the same sense of being uncomfortable, but not quite as intense as in the dream. Think perhaps this might be one of the factors which caused me to dream about solving problems. Perhaps the uncomfortable and tense feeling I had earlier in the day still remained with me and when I was not able to consciously suppress it, it again came out. For some reason for which I can't explain I felt in my dream the way I felt about an examination I took in German last June, discouraged and tense.

This dream took place in a hospital, I don't think I was aware of the exact hospital. I was taking care of my closest friend a young married girl of 22 yrs. I went to plug the light into the wall socket, but before I could water started flowing out of it. It began coming faster and flooding the room. I was unable to stop it. I went out to the desk, called some one to come to repair it. When I returned to the room the water seemed to be a couple of feet high so I moved the bed out of the room down the hall by the desk, but the water seemed to continue to flow down the hall - What happened after that I can't remember Don't know if the water was turned off or not.
Interpretation
Recently I had taken care of my friend while she underwent an operation. I had not seen her since she has returned home from the hospital, and I have been wondering how she is. Also on the day one of the pipes had been leaking gas, and just before retiring that night we had been discussing the event because at the time it created quite a disturbance. I believe that my dream was more or less a continuation of my thoughts during the day.

This dream was very vague and confused. I can't tell exactly where it took place. It seemed to be in a basement of some building. In this room they were selling eggs - There seemed to be many regular egg boxes piled up in rows in the room. I was apparently watching some man, whom I can't identify, gathering the eggs. He was just about to take a egg when one of the chickens pecked at his hand which caused it to bleed. I don't recall any thing else that occurred after that.

In this dream I was in a large room, which was filled with people, it seemed as if it was some sort of a rally. I remember borrowing a white soft sweater from one of the girls, who is about 24 yrs old and also a nurse. Then I went over and sat on the floor, and I found that I able to sit with my legs crossed which I can't do in actuality because of a congenital condition, and I was so amused and surprised -- I kept telling every one and showing them how I could sit. In the dream some one was displaying objects which could be sold, for some purpose or another. She held up a pair of stockings, nylons, and I remember every one made a rush to get a pair. But I did not go, but remained sitting.
Interpretation
That same evening I remember reading a notice in the bulletin board about one of the students was a distributor for hose for some company. Perhaps that had some thing to do - the part about the stockings also as a child growing up I have always felt disturbed about the fact I could never sit like the other children, and as I was on the heavy side I thought it was because I was over weight; which I have found out it was not due to that. Recently I have been losing weight, and I think the old unconscious idea which was associated with this over weight has been aroused lately because of this.

It was raining in my dream and I was coming out of the hospital going over to another building. I remember that as I was running across I noticed the long line of people standing in line, out in the rain waiting to be seen by the doctor in the out patient Dept. Some were older men and women, and as I entered the hospital I remember feeling upset and despairing about seeing them out in the rain, waiting patiently. I thought that certainly other arrangements could be made for these people.
Interpretation
I have recently had more contact with the hospital, which I haven't had for some time and I often times have to go through the clinic to go home at night and I see patients waiting patiently and hopefully. It usually leaves me uneasy, for a line of thought about their social and economic and health status goes through my mind and I feel often times that life is so hard and such a struggle for some.

I went to the store to buy a newspaper, which cost three cents. Had a five dollar bill with me, but I needed the change. The person who waited on me apparently couldn't make change for he keep over charging me. I keep insisting that the paper was only three cents, that he wasn't giving my correct change. I was growing impatient as I was suppose to have an appointment at 8 o'clock. I don't remember who the appointment was with however. It was growing very late, and getting dark outside. I remember calling to another person, apparently the owner of the store to come over & show this boy how to count. He told me the reason for the mistake was that you had to pay for the service besides the paper, and so it really wasn't a mistake at all. The last thing I remember is that I left the store without the paper, already late for my appointment and very upset.

This dream was a short one, but one which made me very upset. In this dream I was wheeling my father in a wheel chair. We were in a hospital and I was showing him about. I kept saying that you must get well real quick so that I could come home and take care of him. I started to cry when I was looking at him. I remember how pleased I was when I was showing him about and introducing him. Yet at the same time I had the feeling of sorrow. I woke up feeling terribly depressed and I kept seeing him most of the day.

r had taken my Godmother's daughter, who is 17 and like a sister to me, to some sort of a lesson & while waiting for her I thought I would talk with one of the advisors at this building. I believed it to be like a placement service. I went into a room and found a man well dressed who spoke like a physician instead of a placement advisor. He began questioning me about my feelings, I became afraid for he said I would need a series of treatment which would be expensive. I told him the reason I came was that I wanted to find some sort of part time work. He didn't seem to understand, & he told me to take G. home but to come back because I was a sick person. I hurried out, but didn't have any thought of returning. It was raining when we went out side - as we walked along I noticed that this mob was following us. I saw a street car coming so I told G. to on to my house, that I was going to take the street car & go to her house. I felt that I must talk to her mother about what had happened. However when I was on the car I found that this person was there also. I had forgotten to get a transfer so I went back and obtained one. When it was time to change cars I got up quickly & ran for the next car. It seemed as if I got on the car with out being followed this time.

I stopped at some sort of gym department to see about working part time. The instructor was a older woman but seemed very kind. She asked me if I could sing. I told her that I couldn't too well, but that I knew quite a bit about music. She called in a couple of girls to listen to me sing, and decide if I could. I remember trying a number of different songs, but I only knew small snatches of them. After I sang they all took a vote. Each one said that I only rated about 50%. On this basis the teacher decided that I should not have the job. She was very nice about it; and I thank her for at least considering me and went out.

I was coming home from church and it seemed as if I was with F. who is thirty nine years of age and with whom I used to go with, but whom I don't see any longer. It seemed he stopped to get some ice cream and I took the opportunity to go home without him. I think I felt that I didn't want him to come home with me. When I got home I took my father out to the porch. It seemed as if I just picked him up in my arms, he was so little. After a while F. came up to the house and I introduced him to my father. I felt as if I didn't want F. to see that my father was so ill. Then F. took the ice cream to the ice box. I told him I would be in in just a few minutes, but I didn't. When I did go back there was a note from him saying he had gone. I remember my father asking me if I was interested in him; he hoped not because he seemed too old for me - I assured him that I wasn't interested in him.
Interpretation
That perhaps I felt guilty going with a older person, and I didn't want anyone to know that I was going with this older man. As a matter of fact I did feel that he was too much older than me, and that I was turning to him because I had lost my father and needed someone to take his place - He did ask me to marry him, but I told him that I felt that perhaps we shouldn't see each other any more.

In this dream I was at some sort of cottage when a number of others were there also. It was some sort of a party, and we were playing cards - Can't remember if we were playing any thing special. Everyone was laughing and singing. I felt that they should pay more attention to the game instead of fooling around. Suddenly I got up and said that if they couldn't do any thing else then I might as well not play.

In this dream I was working on two huge size pieces of paper. They were so large that I couldn't reach across them put I had to walk around them. They were both mapped out in various squares. It seemed as if I was trying to make an assignment of patients and I kept placing numbers in the squares, but then would erase it and place it in another place. Others around seemed to be giving me advise where I should assign various people. I began to get discouraged, I had holes in the paper from erasing so much, and it seemed as if I couldn't make the assignment complete in time it should be.

In this dream I was Skiing, yet I didn't seem to be at any Skiing resort. In fact I seemed to be around here. There was considerable amount of snow and there seemed to be high hills. I was with a woman doctor who I have frequent contact with. She went before me, and she fell. When I came down I asked if she had broken any thing and she replied she thought she had broken her hand. When we looked at her hand one of the bones was bend up, she laughed and said perhaps she could push it down which she proceeded to do. However we both decided that she should go to the hospital which we did - Later on I dreamed that someone had a little puppy dog - I don't recall who the friend one. It was a small thing with hair which covered its eyes. The front left foot was missing, and when I remarked of this the person said that it didn't stop him from getting around because he had an extra foot at the side. When I looked further there was a small foot by which he could certainly get around with - To demonstrate to me he ran quickly up the stairs.

I was in the basement of the Church of the Covenant where a number of young people were gathered. They were planning to go to the ball game. All the girls seem to have dates except me, and I was hoping that perhaps some one might ask me. I went upstairs and there a boy asked me if this was where he was suppose to meet for the ball game. I said it was & asked him if he was going. He said that he wasn't sure at this time. I don't recall that I knew him, he had red hair - and was a clean cut nice looking fellow. He was reading a book - I asked him what is was about and he told me it was about philosophy. We seemed to stand there talking for quite some time. I kept thinking and hoping that perhaps he would ask me to the game - I don't remember how it ended, but I don't think he ever did ask me.
Interpretation
Earlier in the evening one of the girls was saying that a fellow she knew wanted a date as he was new in C. & didn't know many girls. She told us how nice he was, for she had known him before. I thought to myself when she was talking about him that I wouldn't be the one to go out with him, and if I did it probably would be for one time only for I'm not to at ease with the opposite set, and feel very tense when I am with them, although I wish I wasn't so.

In this dream I was in a class room situation. I was standing before the class giving a talk. The subject concerned the problem of learning to speak before a group. I was saying that I had read or been acquainted with a boy who was very insecure about reciting in front of a class, but made himself talk before the class. I told this class that I had felt the same way, and that I had to force myself to stand before a class and do public speaking. As I was talking I could feel myself completely relaxed and very much at ease. There was a discussion following this in which I took a very active part.

I dreamed that my mother & father were living and that I was at home with them. However my father was ill in bed. I could see him sitting up in bed, then out in the sun porch. He kept asking me when he would get well, & if he had to continue to take the "shots. " - He was getting medication for lues. I tried to explain that it would be necessary for along period of time, but not to become discouraged that is was a long treatment but would be helpful to him. I asked him how he thought he had become infected & that did he have any idea how long ago it was. He seemed very surprised that I had any idea what it his illness was & he asked me if I knew. I said yes, that I wasn't a child. He began to talk of a time when he went out with some of his friends about eight years ago--however I can't seem to remember any thing more. I did feel however, that although my mother was in the dream she didn't enter into it actively.
Interpretation
Yesterday in class we were talking of the treatment of diabetes & the necessity to take insulin - by hypodermic continuously. This I believe caused the return of my memory when not so very long along my father was taking medication in such a way, for lues.

I was again living at the nurse's home, but there didn't seem to be any one there that I knew. It seemed as if I was looking for my pearls which I had lost. I had just come off the elevator when I saw part of them on a table in the hallway. It seemed as if there was only the two ends and when I tied them together and put them on they were much to short to wear. I began looking all around again, and then I found the middle part. All the pearls were present and I immediately fastened them together and wore them.
Interpretation
I have just recently lost my string of pearls which I value a great deal.

It seems like I was at a lake. I can remember I was sitting on the beach with my shoes & stockings off. The water kept coming higher up on to the beach and I had to keep moving my shoes up. I don't think I was by myself yet I can't remember who else was there. Next I seem to be on the street where I lived as a child. I was just walking along when my closest friend's father called me over to read a letter from his wife, who is dead now. It seems like she was over in Scotland, her home. The letter wasn't written on regular paper, but I don't remember what it was written on, or what it contained. However, I think the letter contained pleasant news.
Interpretation
One thing keeps coming back that happened during this confused dream is that I keep going over the words, most precious days or things in your whole life.

I was at a big celebration on an isolated island. Several of my college friends were there as well as many small children. Everybody was singing and continually excusing themselves to go to the bathroom....
I climbed a coconut tree on which there were only two small coconuts and these were covered with small white spiders. I came down out of the tree and told my father about the coconuts. He wanted to see for himself, so he reached to the top of the tree and bent it down to the ground....

I became transformed into the figure head of a small boat in which there were two passengers. We were sailing home--around and round in circles. I would sink under the water and then my passengers would. This continued until I was awakened by the alarm clock.

There were both sexes in the dream--the college students about my age and the small children within a 5-10 year age range.

I came out of a store to find that a policeman (about 40 years old) was putting a ticket on my father's car. I got in the car behind my father's in order that I might drive it away before the policeman placed a ticket on it. The policeman got on his motorcycle and pushed the car backwards. I immediately moved forward and crashed through a pink light. Then I found myself trying to drive the car down a narrow aisle in the 5 & 10 cent store. A cashier asked me to leave and I did. I got out on the sidewalk and the car was transformed into a bicycle which I rode down the sidewalk. I passed an Army Surplus Store outside of which four girls (in their 20's I would say) were modeling army fatigue outfits.
Interpretation
One Wednesday, September 28, I drove a friend to the police station so that he could pay a parking ticket fine. This incident probably explains why I dreamed about getting a parking ticket. When driving it is difficult for me to judge how narrow the driving space is. I guess the 5 & 10 cent store aisle would represent a very narrow space through which I was trying to drive.

I was shopping with my friend (male--age 23). We were standing in front of a store. He was giving me some money so I could go in a grocery store to buy a few things (can't recall what). He remarked that we should both try not to spend so much of his money I was rather surprised. I went into the store but could not bring myself to spend any of his money. So I went out of the store. In order to reach the sidewalk I had to walk through a field of weeds and high grass. When I reached the walk I saw that the parking meter for the space we had parked in was not registering. I put a penny in the meter and started to walk home having decided not to wait for my friend.

It was an hour before my sister's (age 22) wedding. I was all ready dressed in my bridesmaid dress. I kept wandering around and my dress fit loosely and was getting wrinkled and dirty. I saw the bride in back of a house--it was not my sister but a friend from home (age 24-female). I wandered around some more--The time went so slow. Then I saw the bride sitting on a rack all by herself--this time it was a sorority sister of mine (age 22). She had a terrible rash on her face. Then I was on an elevator with an usher whom I did not know. We got off the elevator and many many people standing outside a big building. Then I saw my sister. She was not dressed in her wedding dress but in her "going away outfit." At that moment another friend (age l9--female) danced by in a white dress with red flying panels which she held at arms length. Then I noticed that I had forgotten my gold slippers and my mother (age 45) was just telling my sister to drive me home after them when I woke up.

I came home from school for the first time in some two weeks (although school seemed to be within walking distance) to find that we had moved into a new house. It was a very modern, spacious house. It was so big I didn't even get a chance to see it all. I went down to the basement and found my mother (age-45) ironing. There were big picture windows in the basement. I said good-by to my mother and started off to school. I found another flight of stairs leading up from the basement into a passageway (with a glass roof) leading to the living room. I went outside and it was raining very hard. I ran to the corner and stepped into the doorway of a store. I fell down and got mud on my raincoat.

I was walking on E--- at W--- Park at night. I had on my bridesmaid dress (which I wore at the wedding of my sister). Suddenly a strange man flashed a light in my face and laughed. Then he started chasing me and I ran into a dingy bar. There were many men at the bar and it was very noisy and smoky. I didn't know what to do.... Then I was in a designers shop. My gown had been ruined in some way and three women were making me a new one just like my old. I kept worrying about the time because it seemed as if I should be at the wedding. No one would let me call my parents and I didn't know where I was....
Then I was with my cousin (female-age 5) in a small room--I don't know where. I left and went outside to a parking lot where I found my parents (both 45 yrs. old). Then my cousin came running out and she was crying very hard because she thought she had gotten separated from me. I felt very bad for having left her....

Then a friend of mine (female-age 20) appeared in my newly made dress. I was disappointed because it was a dull brown whereas the original had been a beautiful orange color. I said "Do you get to have the dress after the wedding?" She said "Yes."

A friend (male-age 23) took me into a building in search of something (I don't know what). He opened a door and there was a winding corridor cluttered with dusty antiques. We followed the passageway until we came to an open room. Several men popped up from behind objects(with rifles.) and we were stopped. Then two girls (probably about 25 years old) came in with the leader (male) of the gang who was fat and about 35-40 yrs. old. My friend was taken away and I was led into a waiting room where I sat with the two girls and a man. Eventually another girl came out of the room adjoining the waiting room and said it was my turn to go into the leader's bedroom... The scene changed to the hallway where we had originally entered. There was my friend and several policemen, (I was just an onlooker for this portion) and they were in the process of collecting the gang together.

I was in a car with my father and mother (both 45 years old) and one other person (perhaps my sister age 22 but I am not sure). We were passing a golf course. Suddenly my father started driving faster, explaining that he had seen a man just drive (hit) his golf ball and he was afraid it might hit one of the windows in our car. The next thing I knew was that the ball had come through the rear window and it hit me on the collar bone which immediately swelled up. Also much glass lodged in my neck. We started home so that I could be doctored. We had only gone a short distance when the bump on my collar bone disappeared and I seemed perfectly well....

Two girls and myself drove out of the city on a road on either side of which were beautiful wooded areas. We were going to a gas station to get the owner's advertisement to be put in the M--- annual. We by-passed the gas station and pulled into a private drive in order to turn around. The girl driving kept on the drive until we came to the house. (She thought it would be easier to turn around.) We stopped by the house which was located in a wooded area. The other girl (not driving) and myself got out and walked into the woods. Suddenly a big handsome man (about 40 yrs. old), presumably the owner of the house, appeared. He asked us what we were doing and we told him. Then he began telling us how someone had come into his woods and scared his pet frog. The frightened frog jumped into a small stream where he got caught on a jagged rock which slit his throat. The man moaned that the frog had died and would no longer warn the man at night if the woods were to catch on fire...

I was in a room above the garage in my home. The room was used for storage. I was attempting to clean it up and in a desk I found all my notebooks and school work from the time I was in grade-school. I also found some photographs of myself at Girl scout Camp when I was 12 years old. In these photographs I had on a striped bathing suit. I was enjoying myself while looking through all my old notebooks etc. Then I came across a piece of art paper upon which was pasted a stylized primitive figure. I was very surprised for this design was exactly like a design which I have been stenciling in my Related Arts course (in real life). I had a sense of guilt because I felt that I had copied a design. The fact that it was my own design did not decrease my guilt.

Our dormitory (M--- H---) was having an exchange dinner with D--- fraternity. The procedure was not usual, for the boys came over separately instead of in a group. Also, it was a very crude affair for the boy and his date were not properly introduced. Furthermore, our housemother (age 50?) did not wait for all the guests to arrive but went on into the dining room with three girls and began eating.
I was sitting in the living room on a couch facing a card table. A member of the fraternity (age 26) whom I knew, was sitting at the card table eating a very frugal dinner. His date (age 17) came in from gym class and sat down with him. I thought it was very stupid that this fellow was matched with this freshman girl. I felt embarrassed because I sensed that he was having a horrible time. Neither was paying any attention to the other.

I was dreaming that I got up on this Saturday morning in M--- Dormitory after the breakfast hour. So I went over to the C---D--- to get an orange so as to have some breakfast. On the way back I saw my friend's (male-age 23) friend (male-age 22) on his way to Saturday morning classes at D--- school. I suddenly realized that my friend was sleeping in a third floor room ( I live on the second floor) in the dormitory, and that he would be late to school if he didn't get up. But instead of waking him, I went directly to my room. There I commenced to undress while at the same I watched a very strange affair going on outside in front of the dormitory. It seemed as if a group of students were rehearsing for a play which they were going to give. There were several students, both boys and girls whom I knew, dressed up as the well-known "keystone cops." Then there was an old electric car in which sat another male student in an early 1900 costume. Also there was another girl in appropriate costume who kept running back & forth between the car and the policemen always pleading and falling down on her knees.
Eventually I heard a knock on my door and I knew it was my friend. He started to come in and I said "Wait until I get my pajamas on." He came in and I was very frightened, for, of course, no boys are allowed in dormitories other than in the main living rooms.

We sat down on the bed and he kissed me. I kept getting more afraid. I told him he would be late to class. So he decided to leave but I didn't know how he would get out without the housemother detecting that he had been in my room. I decided to go with him and so I opened the door of my room. Much to my surprise, the hallway had been transformed into a sidewalk and there were many men walking along in both directions. I was very relieved.

I was at my friend's (male-age 23) home which was a very large converted theater. We were in what appeared to be the living room. I was holding two cups and saucers belonging to my friend's mother (age 55). I walked into another room (the kitchen) and there I accidentally dropped the cups and saucers. They broke upon my bare feet and I had many cuts on my feet. The maid (who in real life is a worker in M--- dormitory-age 50?) was there and she gave me several pieces of chicken which I put on my feet to stop the bleeding. I walked back into the living room. My friend's father (age 55) had joined him and when I entered I was very embarrassed because I knew the father (who is an M. D.) would think me very foolish for putting chicken on my feet.

I was standing with my family (mother & father, ages 45 and sister, age 22) and several other unknown people by the runway of an airfield. We watched a very large airplane take off. The crewmen were sitting on the wings and not until the plane had taken off from the ground did they begin to crawl into the plane in single file. It seemed very dangerous. The plane did many loops and turns in the air and I was afraid it would crash. Then there were many miniatures of this large plane which would dive into the ground and then bounce back up into the air. Next a group of jet planes flew by. One of them crashed by my sister. The plane when it crashed turned into a toy airplane. Nevertheless everybody ran except my sister. The next thing I knew, my sister was blind and I felt that it were my fault.

I was bicycling down a long, wide highway. There were many other people on bicycles too. There were many many stoplights--perhaps two within 10 feet of each other. I was striving to reach each of them when the light was green. But every time I would get to one it would turn orange or red and then I wouldn't know whether to go on through and then I would worry about being arrested. (although I sensed the change in color in the stop lights I did not see the colors in the dream)...
I was standing in a hallway in a dormitory ( I don't know what dormitory). I was helping a friend (female-age 22) find a hooped slip which she could wear under a formal. I found one in a drawer in the hallway. The hoop was made of dress hangers and it looked very nice. She was glad to get it.

I was walking along a street (I don't know where). I stopped as I saw a short distance in front of me a manhole with one of those wooden horses used by road workmen extending across it. A man was tied to it by his ankles and wrists much as a pig is tied for roasting. Suddenly there was a great cloud of smoke around the manhole and as I looked I saw that the man had been burned to death. One arm, his head and shreds of clothes remained on the wooden horse. It was hideous and as I looked away I saw two hospital attendants (males) approaching in the opposite direction. As they passed I saw two men lying on the stretcher side by side. I heard someone (I don't know from where) whisper "They are dead." It was such a nightmare that I woke up.

The dream began when I was standing in front of a large building at an intersection on S-- C-- A--. The next thing I knew, I was inside the building standing in front of the elevators and pushing the buttons which signaled for the elevators. However, in my dream these buttons now acted as a doorbell to my dentist's office on a floor above. Since there was no answer to the button which I rang, I assumed my dentist was out, and I left. I felt rather relieved that I didn't have to see him. I walked out of the building and this time, next to the building entrance, I noticed a movie theater. I stopped to look at the pictures posted on the billboard. I noticed that the people who were starred in this picture looked familiar. Then I realized that the stars of this movie were my mother and father-in-law. I looked at each picture carefully now. I noticed that in each picture, the expressions on the faces of my parents-in-law were different. In one picture they looked surprised, in another happy and in several they appeared to be scowling at each other and fighting with one another. My mother-in-law did not look like she does at the present time. In the dream she appeared as she did when she was much younger. I then remembered that my brother and his family lived in an apartment in this buildlng, and I decided to visit them. For some reason--what I don't remember--I could not visit them. Here the dream ended.
Interpretation
I do not have a dentist appointment in the immediate future, so I do not know exactly what prompted me to dream of it. However, I have a fear of going to the dentist and consider it an unpleasant "must." Therefore, the relieved feeling of not having to see him. My mother and father-in-law have not been on good terms with one another for some time now and I have seen somewhat concerned about it. I notice that most of the pictures portrayed scenes in which they were scowling at each other. Also, I recently saw a picture of my mother-in-law when she was young and was amazed at her youthful beauty. This very likely impresses me very much so that in this dream she appeared very lovely. I hsve no explanation for the decision to visit my brother and his family.

This dream concerns an artist friend of my husband's. He is an old friend, and he and my husband. have known each other since they were children. He is about 25 years old. The dream itself is short--only a fragment. In my dreams, I was this friend standing and looking over the shoulder of a fellow art student who was painting a picture. I felt rather puzzled at seeing him at art school and back in C--, as I knew he had graduated from art school this September and had received a position as a commercial artist in C-- to where he moved with his wife just several weeks ago. When I asked him why he was here, he said that he disliked C-- and his job and preferred going to school. For that reason he came back. I felt happy about the fact that he returned.
Interpretation
I feel this dream is significant because of what it represents. This boy and his wife were our dearest friends. When they left town, it affected. me for quite a while. The fact that he came back in my dream was a way of expressing an unfulfilled desire. (I wanted them to come back). Also, they had set out to find work. Our friend had finished school. The very fact that he came back to school here, and not, for example, to a job here, shows that school represents security to me. I felt happy because he came back to school. The prospect of leaving school represents a full adult life with added responsibilities. It is something I do not feel quite prepared for as yet.

This dream is merely a fragment, but it is all that I can remember. All that took place was in the home of my sister-in-law (my husband's brother's wife) who is 35 years old. My sister-in-law and I were standing in the bathroom and were looking the room over. My sister-in-law began explaining to me the details of how she planned to have the room remodeled. In my dream it seemed as though there were definite plans that were going to be carried through, immediately. All I remember seeing is the glass mirror of the medicine cabinet. In my dream however, the mirror appeared more metallic than glass. My sister-in-law explained that she was going to have this mirror extended in a modern curved line down to the bathtub. Then I remember seeing my sister-in-law's face very vividly. I was very much impressed by her plans, and just a little bit envious.
Interpretation
I had just heard, several days before this dream, that this very same sister-in-law bought a television set for her home. I am continually impressed by the standard of living she malntains, particularly since she lives slightly above her means and likes to identify with the socio-economic class considered slightly higher than hers. She is constantly improving the appearance of her home and enjoys fine things. I feel slightly envious of her and at the same time I am impreseed by the standard of living she attempts to maintain. Yet, her activlties do not affect me deeply. I think this dream is indicative of my feelings about her and her activities.

This dream consisted merely of seeing one of my professors faces very close. He appeared to be smiling and very friendly and I had the feeling that he wished to help me through some difficulty which I had (what it was I don't remember). When I awoke, I had the feeling that this was part of a long dream with a series of events in them. For some reason this was all I could remember of it. I had a vague feeling that other students were standing around with me.
Interpretation
I can only interpret this dream as signifying that this professor was helping me though my course in college and was in that was assisting me in overcoming some of my more difficult studies.

In this dream I remember hearing the news that my mother had died. I remember feeling very upset, at the news. I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and dread of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid.
Interpretation
Here is a classic illustration of the oedipus problem. It is difficult for me to say exactly what this dream means, but it is obvious to me that many of my unconscious feelings toward my parents came out here. Any hostility for my mother which I have was expressed in this death dream. The pity I felt for my father is significant of my feelings toward him. Pity for myself was also experienced and a lost feeling knowing my mother was gone. My hostility feelings toward my mother are never expressed directly. The anxious feeling in the dream--probably guilt feelings.

In this dream I discovered suddenly upon waking up from a sleep, that I was the mother of two baby boys whom I gave birth to at the same time. I remember feeling surprised at not remembering giving birth, but I seemed quite proud of being a mother. My mother then informed me that I was pregnant again, but the doctor who diagnosed me said he wasn't sure of this he had heard some noise in my stomach and for this reason felt I might be pregnant. I didn't experience any pain in this dream, but I remember going through the motions of being in pain, I couldn't walk well and I acted as tho I were very weak. I remember showing off the babies to people who came into the house.

I dreamt I was walking along the movie shopping district of my childhood neighborhood with my husband. We passed an old shoe store which I remembered well from my childhood days. In the window were some interesting shoes for women at bargain prices, my husband and I went in and I tried on the shoes. I was dissatisfied with all of them and could not find a pair I wished to buy. I remember being frustrated when we tried the new shoes on over my old ones. I knew something was wrong, but it occured to none of us to take off my old shoes.

I remember in this dream going to the tennis courts with my friend, but I do not remember playing tennis. The next thing I knew we were in a building with many people and we were holding our tennis raquets. I met my husband and we began to talk, when one of my professors approached us and appeared quite friendly and interested in my school work. He discussed my last paper with me and then we went into his offlce for a conference. I remember seeing three people leaving his office. He told me my grade which I was satisfied with, but he criticized my work in a beligerent manner and this made me quite unhappy. But I had the feeling, nonetheless, that he was pleased with my work.
Interpretation

I dreamt I was riding on a streetcar and was watching the conductor operate the car. I began to notice the lever which he turned when we rounded a bend. It soon felt as though I were operating the car with him. When we came to a sharp corner, I went through the motions of turning the lever and steering the car. The next thing I knew, I was on top of the car which had now turned into a train. It seemed as though I was very high up and the train was traveling very fast. Several times I nearly fell off, and I felt very frightened. I was also afraid that I would attempt to jump off. I was particularly anxious when the train rounded a bend. I noticed next that another family was sitting on the top of the train with me. A small baby was there and seemed to be thrilled with the ride. I felt as though I was the only one who was frightened.

I dreamt I was taking a bath and was holding a razor blade in my hand. The blade slipped on my leg and I cut a piece off of my leg and my foot came off. I called my mother to come immediately and told her to get the doctor. When she came to the bathroom I had already glued my foot back to my leg with the hope that the blood would coagulate and would harden and help keep my foot stuck to my leg. It was very loose though and my mother tried to help me. We finally decided it didn't look too bad, but we would call a doctor to fix it any how.

I dreamed I was preparing a meal for a large number of people. I recall seeing these people seated at a table in a large dining hall, yet I knew that they were in my home. I had the feeling that there were a great many people here, some of them strangers, yet I could only see a few familiar faces....most of them my family (mother, father, mother-in-law, sister-in-law). I then remember being in the kitchen getting ready to serve and some of the women had come in to help me. I remember dishing out noodles and soup into small bowls and serving them amidst a great deal of confusion. I then discovered to my dismay that I had not prepared enough food for everyone. I served the main course feeling very embarassed, but my sisters-in-law were assuring me that there was enough for everyone.
Interpretation
Two weeks ago I held a largee family dinner at my home. It was the first time I had ever prepared a meal for so many people at the same time. Although the affair was successful, I think this dream reveals some of the anxiety I had about it. I do remember that my mother caused a great deal of confusion during the serving.

In this dream my husband and I (I did not see my husband during the dream, yet I knew he was there) were going out with several other couples. I do not remember exactly what took place but I recall that we wished to go to some place of entertainment very badly, but we had no means of getting there. I remember seeing some woman with a grey P-- lamb coat there and I remember walking down the street wlth these people. She held my hand and led the way for me. Someone suggested we go to a large garage where he knew we could get a car, but he gave the impression that he would have to go thru a lot of red tape to get it. At the garage, everyone seemed very secrative. We got into the car and I knew we felt guilty because it was something we were not supposed to do. As we drove away, I saw some man watching us from a window. I ducked my head down so he would not see me cause I felt we were stealing the car and would get caught. But the driver said he knew the man then we drove away very fast.

I dreamed I was somehow forced to get into a car. I had the feeling I was in danger and I had to get away. I began to drive this car and I felt as though I were in a strange environment. I realized then that I did not know how to drive and I began to feel insecure behind the wheel. I was a truck coming toward me and I did not know where the brake was. The truck gradually stopped as it approached me, but my car kept going and began pushing the truck in a backward direction. The truck driver was shouting at me trying to tell me how to stop and I kept apologizing that I was new at driving. The only other thing I remember was being stuck in the middle of a bill and trying to figure out a way to get off of it.

I was sitting in a corner of my room which is on the fourth floor of a dormitory here at school. A boy was perched on my window sill. This boy is about 23 years old and is the brother of a boy my age whom I dated two or three times my senior year in high school. On the tennis courts which are below my window, a group of people were playing volley ball. Someone hit the ball quite hard causing it to come up to my window. The boy caught it and instead of throwing it down, he jumped. from the window with it. I ran to the window and watched him fall to the ground. very, very slowly. He hit the ground so hard that his head split open and I could see the blood spurt out.
Interpretation
The reason for my dreaming was probably because I had forgotten to turn off the heat or raise the window and it had become quite warm in my room. However why I dreamed about this boy in this way I can not explain. I know the boy only casually and have formed no impression of like or dislike for him.

Two friends were visiting me in my home. One was J--, a very close friend of mine here at school. The other was one of two people. Both of these girls are friends of mine. It was time for us to catch the bus to return to school. We were in a very great hurry and I did not have time to pack so J-- packed for me. My father and his wife (my mother and father are dlvorced and my father is married again. I live with my mother but I am on very good terms with my father.) took us to the bus station which, although we were at home, seemed to be the one here in C--. My father opened the trunk of the car to get the suitcases but they were not there. He had left them at the hotel in which he had lived for a short time after my parents were divorced. Dad and I went to the hotel to get them leaving the others at the bus station. We arrived at the hotel but it seemed a very long time before we left because my father's wife kept delaying us. We finally left the hotel but Dad took a very long way to the station and drove very slowly. I urged him to drive faster so I wouldn't miss the bus but he would not. He flnally arrived and there at the station saw my father's secretary waving the bus tlckets in her hand. We had missed the bus. I turned to my father and asked him to please not bring H-- (his wife) with him any more when I had to catch a bus. I then opened my suitcase to see what J-- had packed for me and saw my pink blouse lying on top with a button off.
Interpretation
Two of my friends did visit me over vacation and we caught the bus back to school but there was no rush about it. I like my father's wlfe very much so I don't understand why I would ask him to brlng her along anymore; however she is quite slow. I don't understand why my father forgot the suitcase and drove so slowly because he is usually quite efficient. I do have a pink blouse and there is a button off it.

My dream is in three different parts and places which did not seem to have any interrelation. The flrst part took place in the kitchen at home. My mother had bought a new brown leather davenport and I was looking at it and wondering why it was in the kitchen. In the next part I was suddenly out in the snow walking along a little path. There was nothing around me for miles but walking along in front of me was a boy who kept getting farther away from me. It was getting dark and the snow was getting deeper. I called to the boy in front of me that it was getting dark and that we should go over to the road so we wouldn't get lost. I recognized the boy, let us call him W, to be a friend of my girl friend here at school. I walked over to the road which was quite slippery and began sliding along. Then suddenly I was in the living room of my dormitory. It was quite different from the way the room really is. I had two callers. One was the boy to whom I am pinned and the other was a friend whom I had dated at home during the summer. (Let us call the boy to whom I am pinned K-- and the other B) Both were sitting on the same couch reading a newspaper. I was unsure of how to handle the situation. I was afrald Ken would be angry because of the other boy. I introduced them but instead of calling Ken by his right name, I called him my brother's name. Then I was once again in the kitchen and the new brown couch had a red leather cover on it.
Interpretation
The brown leather couch was probably connected with the couches in the living room of the fraternity house of the boy to whom I am pinned. The snow was probably connected with the snow on the ground now. The fact that my brother, who is 24, and I are very close may have caused me to introduce K-- by my brother's name. Our kitchen at home is trimmed in red so that might account for the red cover for the couch.

Nevertheless I bought the watch and picked out the ring I wanted. The ring was quite different from what I really wanted.

When I came back again after about a year, everyone was changed and I was very sad because of this. The next part that I remember was in a bathroom. It was quite large and had a very large bath tub.

I was a queen, and I was going to have my will read. I was descending a large, winding stairway and at the bottom stood a handsome young man lighting a cigarette. I do not know him in real life, but in the dream he was my cousin and my favorite relative. He looked at me and said, "Hello," but did not bow. I was puzzled. I entered a large drawing room. Several strange men were sitting there. I guessed they were my relatives. They paid no attention to me but stared vacantly into space throughout the dream. I stood in front of a fireplace. A lawyer arose and read the will. I left large sums of money to each of the men there, but not one of them stirred during the reading of the will.

I was living with my family in a neighborhood of large, impressive houses. The neighbors were not very friendly. I was standing on a lawn feeling lonely when my aunt appeared. She is about forty. Suddenly, down the street, rode my grandmother on a bright red motor scooter. She was riding very fast and going around corners all the time. My aunt just smiled indulgently. Then a group of girls came up to me and said they had heard my father was a famous baseball player and they wanted to meet him. I took them to a large building. We went inside and walked through a lot of narrow passages and came to two swinging doors. We opened them and saw a gymnasium and some men playing basket ball.

An experiment of atomic energy was being made. My father was conducting the test and I was watching. My aunt was to be a victim, along with a young man.

A couple of men went down to see how the experiment came out. They brought the victims upstairs. They were still alive, but my aunt's hair had turned gray and she was haggard looking. I was afraid to look at her.

I dreamt that I was at the C-- skating club at a carnival. I don't remember being with anyone in particular. There were a great many people standing around however. I remember sitting on the built up stands and watching the skaters go through their various acts. And then the show was over and all the people were slowly leaving and it was getting later and later. I was sitting on the steps that lead up into the coat room. Everyone that went by me seemed to not see me although I was sitting there with no clothes on but some kind of a blanket over me. I remember asking everyone to bring me my clothes so I could go home, but they seemed not to hear me. For some reason I had the feeling that I couldn't move. Finally there was no one around but I still couldn't move. At this point I woke up.
Interpretation
I have been told that this type of dream where you are out in public without any clothes on and not being able to move, is a very common dream, and I have also been told that it is indicative of feelings of insecurity. Any further explanation, I can not give, on second thought the fact that I do not skate and would like to be able to skate might be the reason for my insecure feelings. I definitely had the sensation that I didn't belong because I couldn't skate.

Answers to questions
2. I had the feeling of frustration in that I could not move or put my clothes on. A slight bit of fear at all the people ignoring me was also present.

6. Yes, and always after I have been to that same place. Why, I don't know.

As nearly as I can recall, my dream began on an airplane. My companions were students of the same sex, and also a few older women who were apparently our teachers or perhaps chaperones. The interior of the plane was unique in that it resembled a large mansion with an overabundance of large easy chairs. I recall that we were on some kind of tour along the East Coast, with Florida as our ultimate destination. The most prominent thing in my dream to me was the fact that the plane was going by way of Alaska, and that I would have to be on the Plane with all these unliked strangers for days on end. Everyone else was having a good time doing such things as singing, eating, playing cards, and sleeping. I recall that one older woman, the particulars of whom apparently were minor to me, kept pestering me to do things that I had no desire to do. I remember distinctly being afraid to leave my chair or the window for fear the plane would land and I would miss my opportunity to get off and find help. I remember trying over and over again to convince everyone that we did not have to fly the course on which we had started. For some reason I was in a hurry to get back to a certain destination. Neither my home or Florida or any other specific place seemed to be in my dream as where I wanted to be. Occasionally, a familiar person that I liked walked by me, but seemed to be deaf to what I was saying, and apparently they were not conscious of my presence. I can remember distinctly that I thought I was in a world where no one else existed. The last thing before I woke up was that I experienced that falling through space feeling--at which point I woke up.
Interpretation
My knowledge of the causes and reasons for dreams is practically nil. This dream I remembered the next morning, as if it had actually happened. I gave each part thought, and these are my only results. I dislike flying, although when I have flown, no terrifying thing has happened. Perhaps the fact that my first flight was because of the need to return home from college on my father's death. As for my anger over going such a round about way; maybe that has some relationship for my liking to get places in a hurry for fear of missing something. The sensation of falling through space I have frequently in dreams. I have no fear of high places, deep water, and the like. Some say that that falling sensation may be partially attributed to insecurity of one kind or another. The general restlessness of the whole dream might be tied up with my always present nervousness before exam periods.

Answers to questions
2. My most prominent emotions were that I was angry, afraid, and annoyed. My feelings were definitely hostile, and also feelings of doubt.

I recall that my dream began with the sensation of getting off a boat. I was laughing at someone in front of me but I do not recall who it was. There was no one else around at that time. The next thing I remember was that I was in some large building of some kind, yet I remember that the building was surrounded by water and that I was walking all by myself through a dark tunnel way of some kind. All of a sudden I ran into a teacher I had. in high school, my chemistry teacher a woman I hated thoroughly. In my dream I was pleased to see her. With her was a girl that I met one summer while traveling. They asked me to get them a radio so they could listen to some music. I told them I couldn't because I was lost and I remember that I was awfully hungry. They told me that there was no food anywhere. I remember that I began to get frightened and tried to run. The door would not open so I ran the other way for what seemed to be hours, and the next thing I remember I was in my living room. Everyone in the room was looking out the windows at a big lake. On it were millions of big boats and they were all on fire. Then I recall trying to get away from the window but a crowd kept pushing me nearer and nearer the burning boats until finally I was surrounded by fire at which point I woke up to find myself standing up against the head board of my bed.
Interpretation
This dream was just before I got up, therefore it was not a sound sleep. We spend summers on a lake each year, and the night before we had been discussing next summer's plans. The fire, etc., might be explained by the fact that I had just seen a movie in which there was a great deal of fire. Fires always impress me because from the age of one I have been taught the dangers of forest fires in particular, whether the fact that I had eaten a hamburger etc. just before going to bed, has anything to do with my being hungry, is a mystery to me. On the other hand, being a dream near breakfast time, it could. be reflecting my anticipating breakfast.

I dreamt that I was riding along in a big car, only it wasn't exactly a car. I was sitting in a big easy chair which had with it a long footrest. In the so called car with me was my aunt who was sitting in a chair similar to mine. Still another person was present. At one moment she resembled a classmate of mine, and yet the next moment she resembled no one T knew. I recall the sensation that we were driving over very flat and uninteresting country and that we all couldn't figure out why we didn't stop occasionally. Finally we stopped in front of a huge building of some kind, probably a gas station a little distorted. Everyone got out of the car but me, yet I recall I was the one who wanted to stop the most. Finally I was in the ladies room, the others having returned to the car. Right in the middle of the room, there was ?. big bed. I remember saying to myself that I mustn't lie down even for a minute because the others would worry. However, the next thing I remember was waking up with that awful feeling that they had gone without me, and that I couldn't comb my hair and that I was a wreck in general. At that moment I woke up.

I dreamt last night that I was at a friend of mine's house at a fairly large party. Everyone was sitting around drinking beer and some were dancing. I remember that most of the people there I hadn't seen for a long time. I remember no specific people but I seemed to know them well enough to talk to them. Then I went into the kitchen where there were several people, and I stepped up to one person (I don't know who it was or even whether it was a boy or girl). I remember I screamed but nobody paid any attention to me or the person I choked. If I remember correctly, they went right on talking and laughing. The next thing I remember was running down what seemed to be stairs that never came to an end. Then I tripped and fell headfirst down the stairs and woke up with that falling through space sensation.
Interpretation
I was at a party that night, but I knew all the people. There were actually only about six or eight of us there. We did sit out in the kitchen and one boy fell off one of the kitchen stools. I imagine that might explain my falling down the stairs in my dream.

I was standing in a large open space with nothing surrounding me but a large stone wall on one side. I recall that there were some people mingling around but who they were I don't know. Then I walked over to the wall and sat down. I began to eat a sandwich and it seemed that I kept eating and eating on that same one. A person was sitting next to me, a man that I know only casually, and I remember we were talking about how silly the other people were to get in line. By this time various people had gotten in line right in front of us. I remember we were sitting cross legged and that the sun was very hot. The next thing I remember was standing in line myself. I had that awful feeling that I was going to fall down any minute. At this moment I became conscious of a long glass paneling affair surrounding everyone. Through the glass I could see nothing but space, and the next thing I knew I was falling through space and I woke up.
Interpretation
The only thing that I could connect with actual life here is the fact that I had been on a picnic just prior to this dream.

I was walking down town and it was raining very hard. But I have no recollection that I was getting wet. I was with my sister, who is five years my senior, and married. We went in and out of stores and came out of each store with our hands full. Yet before we went into the next store, our arms were again empty, where we left the stuff I have no idea. After doing this for it seemed hours, I recall we were driving along a very narrow tunnel and every once in awhile we would pass some one we knew but we never said anything to them. All the time we were driving along I also had the sensation of going up, as if in an elevator. The next thing I remember was being in swimming in a river with millions of people, because I recall they were all yelling to me to take off my hat and shoes. I was laughing and I don't think I paid any attention to them. Then I remember getting out, and I was home in bed. At that moment the alarm went off, and I remember how surprised I was to find myself actually in bed.
Interpretation
I had been down town prior to this dream but the only place I went was to the movies and not with my sister. The hat might be tied up with the fact that I hate hats, and only wear one when I have to; like when going down town.

I dreamt that I was in a large paneled library--and every wall was covered with books--only the books all had little people on them. There were many people in the room--but I can not remember who any of them were, except one man who I met at a concert in Boston--I have not seen or heard of him since. I recall he had a long broom in his hand, and appeared to be telling the guests who the people on the books were. They were in the majority, my classmates at college. Something he was saying about them was making me mad, and I remember I yelled something at him and he disappeared and suddenly I was alone in the library--I recall trying to leave but there was no door--then I woke up.

I was out in a large field--the grass was up to my knees and it was raining. There were lots of cows all around me. I recall sitting down in a big chair with a small radio on a table next to me. I was reading a newspaper, and I remember reading a story about myself--to the effect that I tried in court for running over a dog--at that moment it seemed as if some big dark vulgar bird was engulfing me and I woke up with a start.

I was out in front of my house waiting for someone, and it was at night - Down the street there was a group of singers standing singing songs. I decided to see if I could join them. When I got to the group I found that they were my aunts and uncles and cousins. I asked them to all come in and have something to eat - They agreed but when I started back up the street with them, we kept walking and walking - there were no houses at all - All I could see when I looked around for my house were stores, Finally they started to go into one of the stores - and I kept telling them that this wasn't my house. They only laughed at me - then inside the store it actually was the inside of my house - and my family were all there. When I began to sing with everyone I woke up.

I was on a train and I had been on it for weeks it seems. I was not upset about it but I was constantly telling all the people that I should be home washing dishes. Then I temporarily forgot about home and was enjoying myself with these people, none of whom I knew, in a big game of cards. What we were playing I can't remember, but I remember I was winning large sums of money and the strange part of it I was very sad and kept trying to give it to the people sitting near me but none of them would take, they just laughed and said I had to keep it. Finally I burst out crying and left the crowd.
Interpretation
My mother is on the train returning home and I had quite a few dishes to wash before her arrival, but the rest of the dream means nothing to me. I never play cards for money and I have no desire to. The only card game I enjoy is bridge which is rarely played for money.

I dreamed that I had a job as counseling. My older brother and I were walking to my office when I saw a group of people standing in front of the door. One of the bodies turned around and I recognized her as the sister of a friend of mine. (This friend at one time meant very much to me. We had planned to be married as soon as I finished college.) The sister, R--, showed surprise at seeing me, as she didn't realize that I was the counselor she had made an appointment with. She made some remark about my being successful and also about my settling down and getting married. I realized then that she thought my brother was my husband. I proceeded to introduce him to all the people. Mr. D., R's father, did not remember me at all, and R explained to me that his memory was failing.
R and I then went into my office which seemed to be in the basement of my sister's home. In the basement I had my desk, which was cluttered with papers etc. There were colorful rugs on the floor. She told me her reason for coming. It seems that her brother was in trouble and she was trying to help him. He had stolen something and was sent to jail. I was quite nervous as these people were my first counselees and at the same time I couldn't possibly see how I was going to help them as long as he had been caught stealing. I felt perplexed because I didn't feel as if I were capable of helping them. While I was talking to her, I was also trying to hurry up the case, as my sister had bought some new rugs & I wanted to see them.

I dreamed that I was roller skating on a very unusual skating floor. The floor seemed to be slanting at a slight degree towards the middle, from all sides. In the middle was a bridge and underneath it were damp wet leaves, grass, etc. I seemed to be the only one skating but there were several men standing around watching. One man was standing underneath the bridge and motioned for me to come near him. I tried to ignore him but the bridge seemed to be magnetized and I was drawn to him. He began to put his arms around me and I attempted to release his grasp. It seemed that I had no strength in my arms at all. I started to scream as I was terrified but I still had hopes that my screams would attack the other men's attention & they would come to my rescue. The other men just looked at me, ignored my screams, and walked away.

This dream took place over in Europe. I was there with a friend of mine. We were planning to escape by plane and fly back to the U.S. As we were making plans, my father got into the plane and started the motors. The plane was unusual in appearance.

H___, the friend who was with me, and I stood there in amazement watching my father try to fly in such a small area that could be used for a runway. There seemed to be a lake around & in one of my father's unsuccessful attempts to fly away, he landed in the water.

This dream took place on our farm. It concerned my brother, sister, father, and me. We had done something to antagonize my father and consequently, we were running away from him. It seemed to be in the fall because we were running through hayfields & cornfields. The corn was taller than we so we thought it would hide us from our father. The three of us got separated & I hid in a building, which was on a neighboring farm. My father followed me rather than my brother or sister. He saw me run into this building and I knew it; so I knew that sooner or later he would come in & get me. For a while, he was running around the building pretending to look for me. This attracted the neighbors attention and soon there were three or four people standing around. My only consolation was that I thought my father wouldn't punish me very severely in front of the neighbors.

I dreamed that my brother-in-law & I were walking down town in C____. We met this friend who turned to me and said that his daughter wanted to see me.

A___ & I drove away and she told me that she was extremely nervous as she had just been in a wreck. She was extremely anxious about her sister-in-law who had just had a baby and who was with her at the time of the wreck.

By this time we were driving down a rather narrow road - just wide enough for 2 cars. It was at night & the street was dark. I offered to drive for her, so she stopped the car & we exchanged places. There wasn't much traffic so I was going pretty fast. Ahead, I could see a car parked & a big greyhound bus coming. I thought I could pass the parked car before I met the bus but I couldn't. We collided & we all got out to see the damages. I told A___ that I had no driver's license but not to mention the fact. The bus driver was rather belligerent at first but it wasn't long before he was trying to help us. He lifted the bus, which was resting on our fender & separated the two. The tire on our car was ruined & he ripped the tire & tube away from the rim. He was extremely helpful.

This dream took place in a large room which is unfamiliar to me. In this room was a long table and on it were some presents and some graduation pictures of me. The room was filled with people - neighbors, friends and relatives. Two of my neighbors, who are 8 and 12 years of age, were standing near the table passing out my graduation pictures to anyone who wanted them. I was trying to stop them and at the same time I was wondering how I was going to pay for them. The gifts on the table were for me. I opened them and each gift seemed to be a deck of playing cards except the last one I opened. It was yarn for knitting, knitting needles, and all the necessary implements needed to knit socks. I remember thinking to myself that now I would have to learn to knit.

I dreamed I was in a psychology class and was sitting next to one of my girl friends. The seats were not arranged in an orderly fashion but seemed to be mixed up in a disorderly manner. I had a balloon & was playing with it when my girl friend reached out to get it. I gave it to her & felt relieved for doing it as I felt Dr. H___'s eyes on me.

I went to a school because I wanted to be a teacher and I thought I would have to speak to a teacher I had when I was in 3rd grade, to get a position. I found her in a library.

I dreamt that I followed a band, leading a parade, down a wide avenue. The band stopped and the small crowd including myself sat cross-legged in the street. A man with gray hair and a gray pin-stripe suit sat near me. I looked up and saw a company: of Ethiopians with regular Roman-like features and grim expressions on their faces riding on gigantic white horses with flags and lances extended ahead of them. They were riding down on us and with only slight concern I crawled to the curb on hand and knees. I went into a picnic pavilion big enough for only one table. I discovered I didn't have any cigarettes with me so I left with a friend of mine a man, 21 years of age, to buy some. We went to a small delicatessen store to get some. While there my mother gave me an aluminum plate, square in shape with the word K---- engraved and embossed on it. When I got back, I showed the plate to a girl which I hardly know and she told me to turn it over and when I did it turned to glass and became an ash-tray. I discovered I had forgotten to buy the cigarettes so I borrowed one from a friend of the boy I had left with. The pack had only a few cigarettes with papers on in it. I took one and then tried lighting one without a paper. I threw it on the floor and watched it burn to an ash.

I dreamt that I got up one morning and decided to wear a pair of loafer shoes that day. I couldn't find them and I searched everywhere but all I could find were summer sandals which I thought inappropriate because it was snowing out. I kept thinking it was impossible that I could have mis-laid them because I valued them so highly. Finally I recalled that I had thrown them away because they needed repairing.
Interpretation
Shoes are my favorite article of clothing and I usually keep each pair long after they have out-worn their usefulness. Recently I discovered the loafers of my dream were missing from my closet but I don't really know where they went.

I was in a large modern hamburger stand. I was waiting for a bus. I saw several buses outside that would pull around a circular plot of grass in front of the store. I stood at a tall window looking out of the window. While waiting I ate potatoe sticks and fritos (both of which I do not care for). My arms were full of books and I found it difficult to eat.

I dreamt that I was married to the brother of a friend of mine but of whom I'm not necessarily fond. He is 20 years of age. It seems that he was very disagreeable and I felt discouraged that I had married him. One morning he was very nasty so I went out to some hill and took a pair of gloves from a dead man lying on the side of the hill. They were white gloves with small red rods printed on them that looked like disease germs. These gloves were capable of giving a fatal disease to anyone I touched with them but they dldn't harm me. I returned home and maliciously infected my husband while pretending to be klnd to him.
Interpretation
I can't lmagine why I felt so destructive. Actually I like the boy and I'm very fond of his sister. I've stayed at their house overnight and in the morning at breakfast he was as disagreeable as he was in the dream. I remember thinking, I felt sorry for the girl he married because he was so ornery.

I was on a walking trip through green rolIing hllls. The weather was warm but I was wearing a winter suit and bedroom slippers. The slippers are the white furry kind and they belong to my mother. Suddenly I came upon a deserted village in a sandy dusty valley. The houses were of adobe. In the village I met my mother and she greeted me as she would after a long absence. I went with her to have dinner. We went to a house that was crowded with people. Dinner was served buffet style. I looked at the table and it was beautiful, adorned with every kind of food, but when I went to take some everythlng was gone except hard boiled eggs which I took but did not eat.

I dreamt that I was descending the stairs in an unfamiliar hallway. At the bottom a friend, (male, age 26) was waiting. I had something in my hand which caused me to be very embarrassed. At the foot of the stairs there was a small maple chest of drawers in the top drawer of which I deposited the article that was embarrassing me. (I don't know exactly what it was.) The man turned me around and kissed me. At first I felt rigid and then I felt as if I were melting and floating away on a cloud.
Interpretation
The person in this dream and I have not been the good friends lately that we were. It stems from a small disagreement and though we date we are both too stubborn to forgive and forget. I imagine this dream was a desire to return to our old basis (platonic) on my part.

I dreamt I was out on the end of a break water in the lake. At a battered shack in which furniture was sold. The furniture was modernistic design and very beautiful. I left the shack and on the way back to 1and I watched the fisherman. About 20 feet from shore I slipped off the rock. I was holding onto one rock and the waves were washing over and around me. I was not in the least bit afraid but only interested in the beauty of the breaking waves. I next found myself on land and the fishermen were showing me their tackle. They made a fishing rod of boxes of graduated sizes. The rod was covered with wallpaper with big dark red roses on it like that on my bedroom ceiling. I then ascended some old wooden steps up to the cliff that overlooked the lake. I walked through a meadow of tall grass out to a point overlooking the lake. My grandmother (90 yrs. old) was there planting a small plant.

The dream begins as I am standing at a window watching a beautiful sunrise. The sky seems to be filled with all colors--red and gold especially against an azure blue sky. I realize that I am in the desert and am in the W-- B--. The next moment I am on the Navy bus going to work. I see the brown hills, the clean white desert, and at a far, snow-covered mountains. My inner feeling is one of great happiness -- I feel completely free and independent.
Interpretation
For several months I worked for the Navy on a base located in the M-- desert. I fell in love with the desert--it was beautiful. I had the feeling of being free. Here in C-- I have seemed to have developed a terrible feeling of claustrophobia. In the first place, it is a dirty city. I have seen nothing of real beauty since I've been here -- just ugly houses and barren trees. I like the feeling of being able to look for miles across the wide open spaces. Living in a dormitory means abiding to several regulations, which takes away any feeling of being independent one might have had. I have thought of the desert a lot since I have been here, and have often wished I were there again.

The dream begins when I am met at the N-- Y-- train station by my boy friend, 24 yrs. (whom I have not seen in a year). He does not kiss me but takes me by the arm and leads me into a restaurant. We are sitting across the table from each other; he does not say a word but smiles in a mysterious way. I try to reach him but while doing so, the table seems to grow in size and I cannot reach him. My philosophy teacher, 65 years, enters the picture. My friend writes out a note and gives it to him, where upon he leaves the room and the dream ends.
Interpretation
The trip is one I am planning to take in the near future. I have no idea what the results will be--but I have the feeling of wanting him but realizing that it may not work out. I cannot understand why he restrains himself when he is with me -- except for the fact that he is a Catholic (I am not). My philosophy teacher's appearance in the picture may have been a symbol for my religious difference. or maybe it was because my friend is a devout Catholic and he did not want someone interfering with out problem--someone who would probably not agree with him in his outlook--so he got him to leave us alone.

Dream begins when I am home in C--. My mother and I are sitting in the living room. I ask her questions about how and when one of my brothers was killed. I ask her how old I was when the accident happened and she says I was five. I answer by saying then he was twelve and that I should be able to remember what happened. Mother starts to cry, becomes hysterical, and keeps repeating that she could have saved his life if she had taken him to the hospital just one hour sooner. She appears to go completely insane. My father, 53 yrs., comes into the picture and tries to help her but can do nothing.--All at once my mouth is filled with blood and my front teeth begin to fall out--dream ends.
Interpretation
Actually I was two years old when one of my brothers was killed by a truck. He was seven at the time. I remember nothing about him, but have often wondered what the facts were concerning the accident. I have never questioned my parents about it, because I realize it would only bring back very unpleasant memories. About two days before I had this dream, the maid here in the dorm told me that once she took an overdose of sleeping tablets, and that if they had waited another hour before taking her to a hospital she would have died. This probably accounts for the part I dreamed where mother said she could have saved my brother's life if she had taken him to a hospital one hour sooner. The disconnected ending, I have no explanation for.

Interpretation
Since I have been away from home, I have naturally thought more about my parents--wondering how happy they really are, etc. I have thought of all the things I want to do and see, and yet realized that probably many of these wishes my own mother once dreamed of--but they were never to be fulfilled. I have thought how natural it would be for a mother to miss her children greatly when they were no longer at home.

I do not know where this dream took place, only that it was in a mountainous region. I alone, was climbing up the side of a mountain with only the earth and weeds to cling to. As I climbed the earth crumbled beneath me but I did not fall. People were below watching in amazement. Only one person can I vividly remember; a girl about 32 years old with whom I worked in a shoe factors in C--. She kept saying I would not get to the top, but I did and I can remember vividly, pulling myself over the top and then being able to walk on flat land, feeling free and happy. The people disappeared and there was just I and miles of flat land ahead of me. Dream ended.
Interpretation
I have done much mountain climbing and have always loved it. I love the out-of-doors, especially when by myself. I like the feeling of being away from people, especially when I seem to think I am bored with them. I remember saying to a friend the day before this dream, that I was bored with the girls in the dorm and dorm life, and that I would give anything to take a trip, preferably to the mountains, just to "get away from it all" for awhile. This feeling was probably responsible for such a dream.

To begin with, I dreamed that my father had been killed while working on the railroad. I seemed to be crying and could feel the choking in my throat. The scene changed and I was in C--. My aunt (40 yrs. old) told me that she and my uncle (58) were getting a divorce. I asked her why and she said that she knew he was still in love with his former wife. The scene changed again, and I was uptown in P-- with my cousin, the daughter (17 yrs.) of the couple written about above. We were crossing the main street and narrowly missed being hit by an automobile. Dream ended.
Interpretation
Not long ago I had a letter saying that lightning struck the freight car on which my father was on, and by pure luck he was not killed. That probably accounts for the first part of my dream, as I have thought about the incidence quite a bit. My uncle and aunt did talk of divorce once, and it is true that he has never gotten over the love for his first wife. It was probably in my mind because the day before this dream I had spoken of these relatives to another person. The day before this dream, another girl and I were almost hit by an automobile. Here it was my cousin, probably because of just dreamlng about her mother and father.

This dream took place in P--, C--. My mother and I were in the public library together. I left her for a few moments and met an older man (who is about 40 years old, was the chaperon on a couple of geology trips I was on and who apparently took a great interest in me). He asked me to go to a bar and have a couple of drinks with him. We started walking toward the city hall and all at once the street and sidewalks were crowded with 'madly' rushing people shouting and screaming. We stopped and heard the sound of explosions, each one getting louder than the one before. Some one cried that the world was coming to an end. We started running back to the library and then stopped again as we saw a car sliding sidewards, going at a rapid speed, which hit another car. Here I seemed to realize that the people in cars were driving as fast as they could in order to escape the explosions and death. People were thrown out of one of the cars. Two people seemed to have been killed. Dream ended.
Interpretation
I probably dreamed of this certain man because I had just had a letter from him. I account for dreaming about explosions because the day before this dream I had commented to some one about how terrible it was that there have been so many explosions lately--L. A. C--, C--. We also discussed the atomic bomb and the fact that it is possible for the world to be destroyed by it. I cannot explain the car accident except for the fact that I have never quite got over an accident I was in about a year ago, and have hence been extremely nervous when riding with some one who is driving at a fast speed--

About two weeks before entering M--- as a transfer student I dreamed that I was dead for two years--that is, I felt as if I were dead but it turned out that I had been in an insane asylum for two years. At the end of this time my friends came to call for me. I was full of questions about everyone & asked why my best friend had not come along to call for me.

I dreamed I had received an invitation to join one sorority and my friend had been asked to join another. I can remember in my dream that I preferred the latter and wondered why I was not asked to join. One of the girls in the sorority which had asked me to join told me that she knew I really didn't like them and that I had told everyone that they did not date very often. The scene shifted to one of the sorority houses (none of them have any). Someone was telling me that "our house"--presumably I was living at an independent student dorm similar to one in which I lived while at the U--- of W--- would have to break up next semester because all of the girls were moving into sorority houses. I was very perturbed because my friends would all be separated and, since my sorority did not have a house, I would have no place to live.
Interpretation
Because of rush week and the various sorority parties, sororities have been the topic of conversation. My friends and I are divided on the opinion of which we want to join, and I imagine that is the reason for the dream.

This dream had many parts, none of which seemed to be related. First I was square dancing on roller skates and found it very difficult to stop. Then I was taking care of a baby who had very bright blond hair. He swallowed something and my mother and I shook him until it came out. We then put him on the porch to sleep in the sun and he turned very tan. He was to be Bing Crosby's fifth son. Suddenly I was at the home of some married friends. Two of our mutual friends arrived, one of whom I dated extensively this summer. I found it necessary to laugh hysterically in their presence. I also urinated in their presence experiencing no emotion while doing so and feeling as if it were a natural occurrence. I then found myself in my own home and my great uncle who has been dead for two years visited us. I asked him why I hadn't seen him for so long, sat in his lap and he stroked my hair as he had done when I was very young. I then watched a boy whom I know only very casually have an epileptic fit--I have never witnessed one in real life.
Interpretation
The only part of the dream I can attempt to explain is the one in which I urinated in front of the man with whom I was in love and our friend who is at present one of my best friends and with whom I have a platonic relationship. They have both told me that I was inhibiting my sexual desires and afraid of sex. Perhaps I wished to show them that I could be very frank and open about sex. Also, the fact that I found it necessary to laugh when I saw them was my desire to show them that I was not unhappy because we had "broken up." As a matter of fact, in real life I was unhappy about the situation for quite some time.

I had to leave a gathering of several M-- acquaintances at which we were seated around a table singing. I had to take part in a Valentine's Day program to be given at my former elementary school. The girls handed me what they thought was my coat, and then another, and then another until they finally came to mine. I remember that all of the coats were dark green although they differed in style. Arriving at the school I asked one of the children how to get on the stage and he directed me. I know I had a costume, but I don't remember it except for a Mexican blouse, and I don't remember my part, The face and name of the Master of Ceremonies kept changing, but he was always the same person. A professor of psychology whose course I took in another university walked down the aisle from the audience with his notes under his arm. He walked to a magazine rack which was at one side of the stage and picked up different magazines, all of which had a cover design depicting winter and snow flurries, sleighs, etc., and one of which was titled the Philadelphia Story. He then walked to the Master of Ceremonies, they kissed, and he took over the remainder of the program.
Interpretation
The only phase of this dream I can possibly interpret is my part in a program and the Mexican blouse as part of the costume. I did a Mexican dance in a program given at the university from which I transferred. I cannot explain anything else.

I dreamed that I went to the movies with some M-- friends during the afternoon. We had to go to the Balcony & we kept climbing flights & flights of stairs. The odd thing was that at each landing there was a candy or popcorn stand & I kept insisting that one of my friends was hungry & that she get something to eat. When we finally found seats they were in a single file & we had to sit one in back of the other.

I was driving a new maroon car and realized when I stopped that I hadn't shifted gears, but had been driving in neutral all the way. The back door wouldn't close and I drove with one hand and kept trying to slam the door with the other. I arrived at my friend's apartment in M-- B--, but it was in C--. Everyone was walking around downtown C-- in beach clothes, very tan. My friend, her parents and several other girls were in the apartment. A man knocked on the door and said he had come to borrow something. He was eating sections of an orange. I remember remarking on the attractiveness of the kitchen. It was all red and white. There was a silent butler of bright red lying on the table. Some of my friends at the apartment were speaking of a birthday luncheon for another friend to which I had not been invited. One of the girls present was a casual friend at the U-- of W--, two were from M--. The girl from W-- was wearing a white half slip. I stood there in a black half slip.
Interpretation
I've been thinking a lot about the new car I'm going to get. It seems strange that, since the only thing I do know how to do is shift gears, I drove without shifting. No interpretation for this dream.

I was staying at a large home--the home Or my aunt and uncle, and there were lots of people around--lots of girls staying with me for some reason. They kept coming in and finally the clothes rack was so crowded not another thing could be squeezed in. A boy in whom I am not at all interested came into my room while I was studying. Then I saw us in bed, I only partially clothed. I kept assuming provocative positions and teasing him. Finally he grabbed and kissed me, and I very coldly told him to leave the house. He then went to the bathroom and I wondered whether he would use my pretty yellow towel. I can remember other bits of the dream--red carnations and a bottle of perfume that was found in the back of an old drawer. The bottle was gold and shaped oddly like a flask or a snake. I opened it and everyone said the perfume was lovely but I couldn't smell it and I, very panicky, kept asking, "Why can't I smell it? Why can't I smell it?" I rubbed it all over my hands in order to be able to.

I dreamed that I was with a very good friend of mine. (We both use our relationship as proof of the possibility of platonic love.) However, in the dream, seated or standing, our bodies were intertwined and neither could move without the other moving. Our hands, feet, legs, etc. were lapped over each other.
Another part of the dream in which my friend was not presented related to a meeting I had to attend. It was to be held in the dining hall of a church and I kept walking up flights of stairs through room after room, looking for my meeting & only finding Sunday School classes.

Interpretation
My friend & I are seen together so frequently on campus that many people have asked us if we were "going steady." This always amuses us as we consider each other simply as very good friends. Perhaps the intertwined bodies symbolized our "togetherness." However, I was surprised & aware during the dream that our closeness was not unaccompanied by an exotic feeling.

Actually I had received notice of a meeting to be held in the dining hall of a church & I remarked then that I hadn't the slightest idea where it was.

This dream is very vague and hard to recall. I know I was sitting on the grass with a school friend. A car drew up & a man got out. I saw the back of his head which had a round bald spot and thought, "He must be related to S--." I have spent several months "getting over" S-- and had thought myself well out of the whole affair at the time of the dream. The man came over & spoke to us & he was S--'s brother. I kept making nasty remarks in regard to S--'s forthcoming marriage thinking at the same time, "Darn! I'm only showing him how much I still care." I also kept telling him my name & was disturbed that it made no impression on him for S--- had supposedly told his brother all about me, that being the height of the sublime.
I think I awoke & then dreamed of being in a hospital--for lunch or something else other than illness. I waited for an elevator in a tri-cornered section. I don't remember much more except that we had a cafeteria-type luncheon & doctors kept wheeling out huge contraptions that looked like the side of a building.

Interpretation
Actually S--- is not bald, but he is being married very soon. His dream brother was quite young & good-looking whereas his brother in real life is much older than he. I'm very conscious now of my feeling toward him because people talk to me of his engagement & proceed to either watch or question me quite frankly as to my reaction. I think the fact that I dreamed of a brother is significant because I have felt for some time that S--- has an inferiority complex because of his brother who is in the same profession as S--- and is one of the top men in his field. Perhaps rather than give him his just attributes I made him young & good-looking rather than very brilliant and very kind.

A boy named Charles Brown was living secretly in our garage. No one knew he was there & he didn't know that we knew, but we wanted to protect him. A letter for him came to the house and I slipped it under the garage door. It turned out to be new license plates. A colored man came up the driveway while I was standing on the back porch with a girl friend. I pushed her into the house and I too went in and tried to lock the door. It was very difficult, but I finally got it locked. Then I saw a boy I had dated for a long time and whom I had considered marrying. He is now married. He was wearing a very gaudy suit, but it was beautifully tailored. He told me that he was still in love with me before he got married, and in my dream he told me to forget what he had said and that he was really happily married. A younger sister of a M--- acquaintance came into my room and jumped up and down on my toes. I turned her over my knees and spanked her. I went shopping with a girl I dislike. She wanted a mouton coat. They showed her one, and I said, "That's not an imitation beaver. That's an imitation Persian." I was to meet my mother and a girlfriend at the H---. My mother--who doesn't smoke--came into the lobby smoking from a long cigarette holder.
Interpretation
It's difficult for me to find any consistent strain in the various parts of this dream. The boy named Charles was red headed and I've become interested in a red haired boy, if that means anything. I think my old friend's telling me he was happily married is a product of guilt feelings on my part--that he may have married to spite me and that he isn't happy because of me. The gaudy but well-tailored suit is typical of him, and one of the things to which I most objected as being so much a part of his "showy" personality.

I and another member of my family (either my father or my mother) were sitting huddled on the stairs. Someone was sitting on the landing above, fishing, and we kept trying to keep out of reach of the hooks. I imagine we could have gotten away but somehow we had to stay. In another fragment of the dream I was driving a truck and two of my school friends were with me. We went from store to store buying books. I could see myself shifting gears & even said in the dream, "Now put her in second, now third," etc.
Interpretation
I have no interpretation, but I do wonder about driving. This is the third dream I have had in which I have been driving and shifting gears has been such an important part of the dream. Perhaps this is because I want to learn to drive & the only thing I can do now is shift gears, but I don't think I want to drive that badly. Perhaps there is some other explanation.

I dreamt I was married to a boy I am seeing quite a bit of but with whom I am not in love. In my dream I was very happy and very much in love. We had a son about two years old. We put him to bed and prepared for bed ourselves. Somehow I hadn't had marital relations with my husband at all except once years ago. I knew that tonight we would--I had no reason for not having slept with him until now, but we were certainly on good terms. Just as we got into bed I realized I hadn't taken my bath. I said I'd be right back & not to go to sleep until I did come back. When I went to the bathroom another girl from an adjoining apartment was running the water. I told her I was in a hurry & to please take her bath next door. She did. I took my bath & rushed back to the bedroom. My husband was asleep. I felt a very strong physical desire to intercourse--I mean I felt it while I was asleep, but it was extremely strong. I couldn't wake my husband & I awoke instead, still feeling rather uncomfortable.

A car full of my friends & I went to pick up a boy whom I don't know at his home. It was an immense home. The rooms were divided by large pillars & we drove right into the house. It was quite a test of driving skill because the pillars were close on either side of the car. I talked to the boy's sister while the others went upstairs to get him. We heard the sound of footsteps outside & looked for prowlers. The wind howled. The boy was just back from the U--- of I--- & said he was D--- C---'s roommate. The sister had red hair & turned out to be only 14 after I thought she was my age. I woke up, looking for & expecting to find a prowler in my room. I went back to sleep & found myself selecting saddle leather handbags. The clerk was a girl who used to work for my Dad & whom I have seen several times recently. All the bags were soiled and marked down. The scene shifted to the dime store where I was selecting jade rings. They must have been made of candy, because I nonchalantly chewed one of them. One was the figure of a Mexican, another a turban-covered face. I was with an older woman I knew but cannot now identify. She was holding my watch for me. It was five o'clock & we couldn't put our call through to Italy since it was three o'clock there, and also because of the telephone strike.
Interpretation
I have been looking for a saddle leather bag, so that part of the dream seems simple enough. Why I should be calling Italy--I am not Italian nor do I have any Italian friends---is beyond me. D-- C-- was in a movie I had seen a few days before dreaming. I cannot explain the U-- of I--. -- I know no one there.

There was a queen contest. I was the Queen of 0-- and one of my M-- friends was Queen of N.E. M-- & S.W. C-- which was the most important "queenship." We were to step forward on the stage, state our name & territory. She, the most important queen, stuttered & faltered. When my turn came I was stately & regal. After the program we assembled downstairs in an auditorium. There were many photographers and several "drug store cowboy" type of boys. One said of me, "She is cute, but I bet she's thirty if she's a day." My former roommate was there & I told her of seeing the man in whom I had been interested. She told me her friends at school didn't like my future sister-in-law, and why had I given her such a buildup? (They've never met her) I said I hadn't. I was eating dark bread & marmalade & offered her some. The bread slice was so thick she had to cut it through the center. I said, "here, take the piece with more bananas on it & there appeared small slices of banana on the bread. There were more confused parts that I can't remember.

I could only remember blurred, confused parts of this dream. I know there was an old, self-service elevator & and my friends operated all through the dream. We'd either stop too high or too low & could never quite adjust to floor level. Something about a man & we, I don't know what cause my friends to say it was his fault & excuse me. I know he was in the dream. We embraced frequently & in their presence. They said our positions were vulgar. I don't remember who he was, but I knew him.

I was back visiting my friends at the D-- in W--. I met all the new girls I've heard about & they seemed to know who I was. One of my friends was wearing two fraternity pins & when I asked her why said, "One's for me & one's his." Another friend of mine looked at me significantly as if to say "She's a dope." The house & rooms were not the same as they are in actuality, but this did not seem to bother me in the dream. I had come somewhere with my mother & it was time to leave. I did not want to take two streetcars & a bus home & it was snowing, etc., so I asked if they could lend me a car. The only one they had was one they said my father had purchased in Europe. It was bright yellow & very strange looking. Instead of my wearing the old-fashioned goggles the car had a sort of goggles & hood affair in front. Whoever it was that gave me the car said there was an over-accumulation of oil. He or she then tipped the car over & the oil--a horrible looking yellow-brown fluid, poured into the mud & strangled some snakes & worms. On the way home there was something about a tennis court I do not remember.
Interpretation
I had Just received a letter from W-- telling me my friend had been pinned & mentioning some of the new girls at the house. That part of the dream was fairly accurate--I saw only those people who are there though the room was different. The other part of the dream was more vague & hard to interpret.

All I could remember of this dream seems to be very scant. I was riding on a horse in the woods. I was conscious of the green grass and the brown bark of the brown trees. After trotting for a few minutes the horse threw me off his back. I was very frightened and yelled. Before I could do anything else, the horse began to chew my hand. It was very sinister to watch him gnaw at the bones. I woke up as he had chewed half my hand.
Interpretation
Probably the brown horse was my goal. When he threw me off it probably revealed someone blocked my goal and I became frustrated. Although this interpretation might be far from the point it does seem plausible. Lately I am beginning to feel my goal in life is being blocked. Because all my friends are getting engaged and I am beginning to feel that I will be an old maid. My inability to get a husband will probably result in frustration.

The interpretation of the horse eating my hand is very clear. On Friday, prior to this dream, I did go to the doctor to see about my finger. From playing golf I received a sore, and this sore developed into a wart. The doctor burned it and nothing remains where the sore had been. The horse in this instance could be the doctor attending to my sore finger.

I was sitting in the kitchen just doing nothing. The time of day wasn't too clear, although I believe it was early morning. Our family owned two cats; a little black kitten and the huge white mother cat. As I was sitting in the kitchen I could hear the mother cat coming out from the basement. To my surprise, a lion appeared instead of the mother cat.
Reluctantly, I rode the lion out to the backyard. After getting off the back of the lion I tied it up to the fence. I might add I tried to tie the lion up to the fence but because I was very frightened I ran back into the house. The dream ended at this point.

Interpretation
I cannot imagine why I dreamed of cats because I actually hate them. The fact that the white mother cat turned out to be a lion possibly goes to reveal that one of my friends has a duel personality. It could possibly mean that this personal friend of mine is directly related to my goal. It is all very peculiar and hard to interpret.

One Sunday afternoon H., 20 yrs., my girlfriend, I., 23, her fiancee, a girlfriend who I cannot identify, B., 23, and I all went to a dance. These are all my friends. We went to a paladium that looked like the H. Theatre from the outside but had every earmark of H. H. at M. University. We all went in but we found everyone singing instead of dancing. Therefore we all sat down and began singing. My three girlfriends from M. University came in also. C., one of the girls was mad at me because I wouldn't exchange seats with her. A boy, I. was there and he was wearing a blue suit and new shoes.
After the program all the kids came to my house. My dad was home and so naturally I introduced him to all my friends. He was so funny that everyone had a swell time. The dream ended at this moment.

Interpretation
Since I have many friends it does seem probable to dream of so many friends. The paladium that resembled the H. Theatre as well as H. probably could be traced back to last year. At that time I had a conflicting cholce to make. I couldn't decide if I should go back to M. University (where I spent my freshman year) or enter F. S. M. College.

The change from dancing to singing could be that I recently joined a choir. My interest in music is being stimulated even though I still hold a great interest for dancing.

The reason that I. entered my dream seems due to the interest I held in him last semester. Unconsciously, I am still thinking of him, although not consciously. He always wore a blue suit. The new shoes probably is due to the fact that I went out the Saturday night before with a fella that wore new shoes. It may be probable that I would a man assimilated between these two characters.

I am very used to having all the friends come over my house so this last part of the dream is very real. Although my dad isn't very funny with my friends. He is very friendly but not very funny. Could it be that I wish my dad to be funny with the company I bring?

Answers to questions
2. I was very happy and excited. I did get mad when we weren't going to dance.
3. An actual participant in the dream.
4. Pleasant.
5. Took place at the paladium but then shifted to my home.

B., a friend of mine around 23 yrs. old and 6 ft 3 in., took me over to the West side of C. to an ice-cream parlor. This ice cream store resembled the store that I had been at in N. R., mirrors composed all four walls. The seats were blue leather with yellow additions. After we finished our ice cream we came to my house where we talked with my family. The dream ended at this point.
Interpretation
I do not know why I dream of this certain boy, B. This is the second time I have done so. It possibly means that unconsciously I want him to like me or visa versa. Since I have been in N. R. before and I loved it could this dream possibly signify that I should be there now? Whenever I bring a fellow back to the house we always talk to my family. Could this mean that my family dominates me?

Answers to questions
2. I had a very content feeling.
3. An actual participant.

5. At first it was on our new express busses, then the dream took place in the ice-cream parlor and then back to my house.

I was all dressed in a white wedding gown about to march down the aisle. The woman fixed my train and I proceeded to march. I was very excited but very frustrated because my dress seams split on both sides just as I was half way down. I blushed and thought everyone would notice. I kept my arms at the side. I finally reached the altar but was nervous all the time because of the split seams. The ceremony was over and the reception started. The dream ended here.
Interpretation
I do have a white dress and recently had to fix the dress seam. The dressmaker cut the gown a little too low so I had to piece the white formal. It probably was on my mind as I applied this to a wedding gown, because of the wedding gown being white.

I was down at M. University with my two girlfriends, H. and H. These girls are around 20 and are very good friends of mine. We were in the dorm studying all night for an exam. Around midnight a lot of my friends came into the room. L. K. was wearing a black moire dress. She looked real slim and received many glances from M. B. Now this boy was an old flame of L. While all these people were in our room I started to put on a pair of brown suede shoes. At this time I woke up from my dream.
Interpretation
It is probable that I wish to be away at school with all my own close friends. This is typical college life which I probably unconsciously yearn for. The girl L. is a good friend of mine although in life she is chubby. Since I am chubby, could possibly wish that I might be slim someday. Probably this dream shows me how I must always have a crowd of people around me. The significance of brown suede shoes is not apparent to me.

It was a very clear day -- the day my sister who is 18 and I were to be married. We were coming down the two side aisles in the H.T. I went first with my father leading me and then my sister followed with my mother. We each had four bridesmaids and six ushers. This is a blurred image. We came simultaneously to the altar where all the attendants were displayed on both sides of the altar. The rabbi gave one speech for both of us and then the dream was gone.
Interpretation
My sister who is younger than me is getting married September 5. Everyone is wishing me to get married at the same time. Obviously, everyone's talking is doing some good if I dream of an exact event. I wouldn't mind at all but circumstances prevent this.

I was at a circus one day. This circus had red and white tents. I was fascinated by the elephants and lions. They were all doing such cute tricks. While this was going on I was in the audience. The feature act was on next and I entered the wing in my gorgeous net costume. I took three bows and then proceeded to swing back and forth. The audience was enraptured but accidentally my foot didn't get hold of the lion rod, and I fell into the net. Here the dream ended.
Interpretation
I do not know what significance the red tent has but I could see it clearly. Obviously I want to be in the limelight but because of a few discrepancies on my part I do not exceed for long. This is probably in part some explanation of the dream. Maybe I am frustrated because I'm not excellent in sports although I love them. It could also mean I want to endanger my life.

I was in a dark forest picking flowers but I soon was bored so I laid down on the soft green grass. A black and white striped horse broke through the window and carried me away rather roughly.
Interpretation
Possibly this dream signifies my outlook on life. First I am content although realizing I'm not in satisfactory surroundings and then some obstacle always follows to throw off my happiness and contentment. The horse could have been the obstacle. The coming of the draft is a threat to my future happiness and I am frankly afraid. I don't know if this could tie in or not.

I was in Room --- at the time of my English Literature class. Miss W, my professor, was presiding when a girl entered requesting that I come to the office at once. This girl (who I cannot describe) barged in just as I was about to answer a question. I flew out of the room but this girl was not there, by the time I came to the door.
Interpretation
I dreamed this the night I was studying for my English exam. Probably in my unconscious I was recalling my last semester's class which I hated because of Miss W. The girl was just a figure for escape but one actually can't escape from his duty. I want to escape but it is hopeless.

I was in a large ballroom with many couples. We were all sitting around talking when N., my boyfriend who is 20 years old, said some nasty remarks. I was very surprised and I felt hurt all evening. The next thing I remembered I was in my house talking to L., N.'s friend, trying to inquire if N. meant what he said. He said he didn't know. The next thing I dreamed we were broken up. I went around asking everyone who I saw, "Is it true?"
Interpretation
When I dreamed about the ballroom I was anticipating the dance I was going to attend. Probably this dream could mean I want to break up with my boyfriend unconsciously or possibly I am anticipating the outcome.

I was in my high school gym watching a group of people roll dice. They were cartoon people - the kind in movie shorts - technicolor. There is an old man with an orange straw hat and a brown loafer jacket - also a colored boy with white teeth, purplish lips, a green turtle neck sweater, with a wool cap to match (orange tassle. Police, in uniform appear. The men pretend to be pitching horseshoes - but the police understand and catch the Negro. They put the orange horseshoes on him for handcuffs - and I realize that the horseshoes are really devises. We all go outside the gym and they do something to the Negro but I can't see what.
Interpretation
I can't, I wrote this - and no explanation came to mine. I have waited & reread it. The colored boy, for example, I can see his face and he resembles no one. The setting - very unreal - no one belongs. I can only interpret that this is a symbolism which my super ago refuses to recognize.

2. I wanted to see what happened. The colors were very pretty.

I went for a ride with J. (J.'s car, but I drove). I made a dangerous left turn across traffic, safely. Once we were on the less traveled road there were oil cans burning as danger signals.
The road we were on is quite well known - to me - about a mile from home. It seems to me: I reaiize that I am risking something by going out with J. Although I am absolutely in charge of the situation (I was driving) and capable of steering away from danger signs, I realize this is not a good road. (He kisses me - it's pleasant - we, neither of us pretends - I don't love him but I like to have him kiss me. Consciously I believe that this is satisfactory behavior by my standards but not by those of, say, my sister). You know what happens when you meet somebody on a secondary road under construction! Crash! I'm afraid that will happen if the boy I date finds out.

My father took me to a large department store; it was late and the store was quite empty. As I walked to our car to put part of the present into the trunk compartment (conveniently located on a high floor of the building - no?) - an old stooped lady reached to take some of my present. She failed to grasp it, but nevertheless I pursued her less she try again. We ran across a wine rug - she tried to trick me by dodging thru narrow doorways and behind chairs. Eventually she disappeared. I was pleased for she was gone for the time being. I returned. D. (who seems to me to have insight into people's actions - my father has no knowledge of him) was helping Father get lunch from the car. He tasted two milk bottles (with straws). They were sour; he discarded them. Father had also brought me a brand new camera with an expensive television attachment.
Interpretation
I wrote this on other paper as soon as I awakened. It is in my recopying that I have guessed a meaning.

I feel that my mother resents my affection for my father, and the feeling he has for me. Therefore I think it is she who is the old woman trying to snatch away the present - sign of his regard for me. And I realize, I guess that this menace can only be silenced temporarily.

With my first copy I guessed that - D. saw the milk (my mother - no?) and rejected it (her) because it would be harmful.

The camera was doubtless to satisfy jealous urges for my two roommates - both have cameras with flash attachments.

Answers to questions
1. The old lady was feeble - therefore I could not harm her. (Honor thy father....)
2. I was glad to pursue her - to take some direct action. I was pleased with the toy & camera.
3. Participant

5. She avoided my father - so he would not know her plan. (He did not know I followed her).

That I was walking up the street of my hometown with a boy (1 yr older - known always - never dated - very good friend). I remember someone saying "How nice for them to be together!"
Interpretation
This remark seems wild. I never (consciously at least) wanted to date him. I think I was unconsciously striving to associate myself with a boy which my fanily knows and approves of. - A good home-town type - you know. My parents disapprove of a man at school whom I like - because of the very difference between him and anyone who could conceivably live in the restricted little viIlage we do.

That my roommate confided in me that during the summer she met A. - he was searching for me and seeing her instead, he captured her. (Wearing a long black cape, he choked her and carried her away.) He confined her for the summer in his harem (He is a Moslem) where she was cruelly treated and given only ice cream to eat. He had many women & their boy children in this low ceilinged structure (the harem) and periodically went on forays for more captives. My roommate learned to love A. and since she was jealous of his love for me - she told me of the summer to arouse my jealousy. I accepted the recital, quite calmly.
Interpretation
He is to me foreign. From another country etc. etc. he is very much the opposite of anyone I have known or understood. Being a high caste Moslem - he is entitled to more than one wife at a time. He is exceedingly attractive; I have always imagined that he has at least had opportunities to seduce other women.

Ice cream was something we always ate together. This seems to strengthen the theme that my roommate was a substitute.

The low ceilings - I am rather tall - he does not like me to wear high heels. Also - they give the set-up a more furtive atmosphere.

Her jealousy would of course give me pride and satisfaction. I crave approval.

2. I accepted my roommates tale because the reality seemed less difficult to face than the doubts I have heretofore endured.

I. and I went swimming. I had never been to this wild, deserted lake. She left after a few minutes, saying she would come back. She never did; I swam - kept busy- G. finally appeared - and took me back. (G. is the type person you cultivate because he sustains your pride-ego-self satisfaction. He convinces me I'm wonderful. I haven't seen him for a while - 90 he came in a dream & said the same things).
Interpretation
The three of us were at a camp for crippled children two summers ago. I. & I were in charge of eight little girls. I never did any of her work except swimming instruction. My pride is reinforced by G.'s reminders, whenever I see him, that I "did all the work." I had just seen I. - she is being married. I envy her that - and this dream made me feel, I guess, that, after all, I am "better" than she is, anyway.

A girl and her little baby named Jo (I unconsciously wrote that spelling when I recorded the dream that night. Sex of Jo never came up again). came to swim where I was sunbathing. It was on a large rock in a lake in Canada. (I spent my vacation at such a place). Girl said she would take me to R. (I want to go there - to see a girl who "jilted" one of my best friends). Girl told me about mauve, long spined animal who might try to eat us if it saw us bathing there. I was amused. They (Girl & Jo) were terrified when it appeared and slid under a ledge. THIS CONTINUES IN MY NEXT SHEET--THEY AREN'T THE SAME DREAM, QUITE--YET THEY'RE CONNECTED.
Interpretation
The animal didn't frighten me at first. I was secure in the warm (SUN). But when girl started to abandon the warmth, for a cold ledge and safety, I came too. If this warmth signifies sexual pleasure, I will bask in it until other people say that cold safety is preferable. Then I am forced to abandon my pleasure and assume the attitude (of fear, which I say is "beneath me", as a protective device. I say "oh the animal will hurt me - I must flee" and thus project on to this animal my own fears of myself. I forgot to tell you that the ledge was so confining - while wide - there was barely enough height for me to lie flat - certainly none to spare. obvious isn't it?

I could not hide under a ledge. There was no room for me. I crawled on and ended up under the bed. It was in a neat, shiny house. The floors were quite polished. The "animal" was now an ape. He tried to snatch my feet from under the bed and eat them. He left periodically, and I was able to "boost" my companions through the window to safety. He came back and closed the window so it would be harder for me to get out. Ape left and returned with friend who was a man. They decided to let me get away. I woke up.
Interpretation
It was a low built bed. There were springs in my face. The neat shiny house - my home. My mother is fanatic about cleanliness (I know - anal sublimation - but she does it anyway). Natch, that I want to escape from home - The animal is eventually close to a man - because it seems that only marriage will really free me from home (and that is only a degree of freedom, huh?) Oh, my feet! They are enormous! I realize that so far I have been able to help people - but for myself - I must go alone. If the ape is my father - he knows I can get through the window, but he is not above putting obstacles in my way. (See, in the end he yields). I realize my mother only appeared through the symbol of "neat house" but in interpretation - she is always there.

I dreamed that I was in my methods class - about 6 boys & 15 girls. Suddenly - a lot more men entered the class - followed by a number of freshman girls. Since it is a "300" course, I could not understand the young girls; I was very resentful. I had the feeling inside me - I hope there has been an error and we can revert to the original.
Interpretation
Is it that I so resent the freshman girl in my dormitory - who is trying her best to date a fellow (J.) I date? Even though I date other people (the entering men) do I begrudge losing anything I consider mine? (J.) I interpret that I have a very selfish desire to keep J. and the method I shall use is to convince him that she is too young.

In H. a woman, former GI nurse, was playing a record player like I want She said she found it on the steps of the Medical Library. The nurse said she likes to walk around - the campus alone at night - I thought "she wants a man, but that's not the best way" - She said she got $65. a month - and as for that being enough, she said, "I may do it." I jokingly said, "You may, but can you?" No one laughed. (Pardon me - I don't know where the audience came from either). Instead of laughing, my roommate said "You have no appreciation of other people's problems." I didn't answer, but instead explained the joke to P. who was kind and encouraging.

I dreamed I was walking down B. Road, by myself, when a car pulled up and said, "Hello, S." That's the name my family has for me and I walked to the car. There were three fellows all tall and good-looking whom I recognized as being people I knew well - but I didn't think of them separately.

My roommate's "man" proposed to me - told me he loved me, and would prove it but I must go and get my roommates scarf to wear, for we were going to the H. for dinner.

I dreamed of strings of light bulbs - Christmas tree bulbs of multi colors - all following one another about in the darkness. The lights circled wildly in the air - and since the confusion of colors annoyed me - the strings obligingly similar - all one green string and all one yellow, etc. I loved watching. Sometimes they seemed to be on a merry-go-round - and you couldn't see the ponies, but just the lights going around. Other time9 the light9 were on a Christmas tree and the strings proceeded (gaily ?) up and do~n the branches.

I dreamed of a circus - made of sequins and rhinestones. It was all exotic colors - no plain blues or yellows - but magenta & chartreuse & aqua - I watched a merry-go-round - all dazzling & glittering. I seemed to be far off and seeing - just enjoying watching - and not darinng to go closer.
Interpretation
I see this as being my cynical skeptical point of view. I did not dare go too close - I was all alone and I was afraid that if I saw too clearly - the beauty would vanish. Instead I knew (and I realize now that this is my customary attitude) that the really exotic world melt upon inspection.

Also, I see all this in another light. I have the habit of tearing down the idealistic and the consequent disappointment when the materialistic is less appealing (in that is has lost its glamour) I have in the last few days, lost my credulity of the charm of a particular love affar - I know that it wasn't the romantic interlude that I made it be in my mind - I can now realize that he didn't love me as I would like to believe - and I feel wistful that it can't be the sequined violet & carmine story I liked.

I seem to get mired in words - "I know he didn't love me in the way I hoped he did - and it hurts - and I would like to regress to my naive belief - and I realize that I had to keep quite distant from the situation to believe anything so foolish.

I was home sitting on the love seat with I. Mother came in, and I felt awkward about introducing him, the form of "I'd like you...". Then Father came, I forgot I.'s name; Father had on his bifocals and seemed to be squinting. Finally, desperately, his name came. The scene closed abruptly.
Interpretation
I had difficulty explaining I. at all - even to my roommates. He is not the type of person to be subtle about - and I don't care to tell my parent about his realism.

The red love seat is of course interesting since the color is the only nice thing about it. It's quite uncomfortable.

You see, I wouldn't "like you to meet" - although I realize that my Father wouldn't see clearly the personality traits that if he did recognize, he'd distrust.

In addition, his name itself is Jewish - and this is a factor that would affect my parents.

Answers to questions
1. I had a date last night with I. I couldn't explain his passionate technique to my roommates - and I know I couldn't to my parents.
2. I was quite anxious and nervous. Supposing that if they understand they wouldn't approve.

I was out in a large pond behind my real home. We were pouring plaster of paris in the lake (or pond) from our small rowboat, in an attempt to hasten the freezing over. Finally we realized that even though the water was completely full of plaster of paris, there would still be difficulties - for before my eyes, the water became brown cement. Buildings were still protruding thru the cement, a white church steeple and the ridge pole of a garage. In addition, the wind was blowing, and so the cement was too uneven to skate on.
Interpretation
I think that I am hinting to myself what "the future has in store for me."

I have freedom of movement in the boat - but I crave the security of firmer ground - so I try to make this water firmer - thru plaster of Paris.

When I can & do get what I am seeking - that security - it may be firmer than I wish - already formed, wlth the irrevocable ridges that the wind made - and the other sides of my personality as hopelessly enmashed as the church & garage.

Currently I am considering marriage - but I am afraid of the independence I needs surrender.

A girl in my dorm was working with Plaster of Paris that night.

We (all the girls I know at school) were in the Stunt- Stunt Night. The stunts were going on, and ended. All was confusion - people - noise. My father was there (unexplainedly). Finally it was time to go back to the dorm to change clothes for the dance. One girl and I were going to the dorm when I suddenly realized that I hadn't seen my date all evening. I was lost - afraid - lonely.
Interpretation
Life to me so far has been enjoyably confusing - and my father and my friends have been there to make it pleasant. There comes this transition point where I must "change clothes" - "get ready for the dance" - and I am lonely - & afraid. Where is the man? I knew definitely the fellow I am to go to the dance with - but have lost him thru preoccupation with other things? When everyone else settles down with "their man" - will I be afraid - walking down the street to home - alone?

I am across the street, in our neighbor's. She has several small children - one is a pretty blonde girl who I make a fuss over. (This is the house I was born in). I am tearing up bread crumbs (I had to do this in cooking class today and remembered doing it for my mother). The little girl wanted me to come & play but I couldn't because a fellow I date was upstairs in the bathroom, and I was waiting for him. Finally fellow came down - he had become someone else.* He came in, grasping neighbor's hand, & her father's hand, firmly. From then on he seems to wander, being either L. or P. without much discrimination. The little blonde girl & her sister & 2 brothers are going to a party, and leave, all bundled up. They all disappear - trouping into the fraternity house across the street - blonde leading.
Interpretation
I like two men - one is my childhood sweetheart, a member of the fraternity mentioned - the other is a stranger - someone who must be endlessly introduced.

Bread - the symbol of life - of "My body" - I am tearing up while I sit waiting.

The little girl wants to play - but instead must go on a date - desire to regress?

The firm handshake & its meanings were recently discussed by my friends. "Firm" is a good sign.

Little girl goes into fraternity house - and she is I - little blonde girl is what I was when I lived there.There is a very subtle similarity between the two - they are both kind & loving, but I'm afraid of the routineness of life with either of them.

Conclusion - I am confused.

I dreamed that I was coming home from a dance - my date was sick & one of his friends had to bring me home. En route home, this friend, who does not resemble anyone I know became quite amorous, frightening me. I finally got back to the dorm; came in a door (which actually does not exist - seemed to be cut through the wall).
Interpretation
This dream occurred right after I had been to a dance - my date had a headache.

My date has a very charming & attractive friend - and it was not until I rewrote this on this sheet of paper (copying it from the record I made at the time) that I knew it is he. It did not have his face - I think I didn't dare recognize him - but he had on a blue suit - and that symbolizes this individual to me Evidently his actions are wish-fulfillment.

And I came in in a different way than I came out. It was a pleasant dream.

I was in H. Fellow I know left an elaborate set of drums sitting there. I went over and sat down. The drums were against the wall - so I turned my back on everyone & began to play. I am absolutely ignorant of drum playing technique. I tried each drum and then I just hit them in a rhythm which was good. I leaned back, satisfied, and reaching for a cigarette - got the pipe which I saw "owner of the drums" smoking yesterday. I took a drag, not realizing; it tasted good. Friend of "owner of drums" - stranger - appeared. He liked the way I played the drums. We had conversation which seemed quite clever, but slips my mind. He could play the drums & showed me how.
Interpretation
Owner of the drums goes to C. - yet has wonderful musical & social talents. He seems quite unhappy. He therefore comes to H. to be appreciated. and I suppose a reason I like him is that I would like to identify myself with his musical ability.

I turned my back on the audience. People comment on my (real, not imagined) lack of musical ability. But one man heard me - and appreciated me - laughed with my that I was smoking the pipe - made clever conversation - is an optimistic sign.

While at camp last summer, I had a recurrent dream that I would forget my mother's birthday, which would occur while I was away from home, and for which I would not be able to get home.
In one of these dreams I had forgotten to call or write greetings for her birthday, and when I returned home found she had died. My father, to console himself, was reading "The Bird's Xmas Carol." I took the book from him, to read it myself. In the manner of dreams, however, I read ahead of the print, and it was meaningless.

I had a feeling of great remorse at my mother's death, and felt a stronger love for her than I had ever known while she was alive.

The dream left a strong impression, and even now, when I think of it, experience a feeling of great tenderness toward my mother.

Interpretation
I do not know why I worried in my dream about forgetting my mother's birthday, for I had looked forward for several weeks to calling her and talking to her.

The "Bird's Xmas Carol" reminded me of a similar incident that happened when I was ten and in the 5th grade, our teacher, just before Christmas vacation, read the story to our class, and while she read it, I experienced the same feeling of love and tenderness toward my mother. I remember running home from school at lunch time to see if she were all right.

I was floating in Lake Erie, and although I did not recognize the site, I had this firm conviction it was off 72nd street. As I floated further out, the land took on the appearance of the Shore Drive, except that it ran diagonally from 72nd St. to E. 9th, which seemed a great deal further inland than it actually is. I drifted farther out with apparent unconcern until I noticed the water was becoming scummy and filled with debris. I then became alarmed and thrashed around in the water, but became tired quickly and ceased to struggle, continuing to float.
Interpretation
Evidently the floating indicates a feeling of security, and the momentary struggle indicates grappling with the cause of the feeling of insecurity, which in this dream was represented by the floating debris. The floating sensation in itself, however, was most pleasant.

Answers to questions
2. Contentment while floating, repugnance at seeing debris, momentary alarm while fighting debris, and resignation when finding out struggling is useless.

This dream was a series of disconnected events, and through its entirety I was strongly aware that I was engaged, and kept constantly twisting my diamond ring around my finger with the thumb of the same hand.
I watched my fiance greet a friend of his by shaking his hand and pounding his friend's hand exuberantly. As a gift, he brought me an expensive pair of eye glass frames in an elaborate glass-case, instead of merely having the frames adjusted, as I had requested. On another occasion, I was sitting on a narrow steel bar about six feet above the ground, discussing my engagement with several friends below me. They later, to my bewilderment, claimed to have known nothing about it, but when I mentioned his name, their enthusiastic replies were how lucky it was that my fiance did not have flat feet!

Interpretation
This dream, I am sure, is a natural result of a tired, active mind as it works during sleep. There was no organization and comparatively little imagination in it--it is only a slight elaboration and pictorialization of thoughts that had come to my mind during the day. Almost all the details can be matched to actual trends of thought.

Outside factors had probably made themselves felt; the engagement ring in the dream was actually a ring I had found during that day which I had believed lost and which I wore to bed. Perhaps my dream-act of sitting on the steel bar above my friends, however, was a subconscious feeling of superiority to them.

The only person in the dream whom I can actually identify was a friend whom I had seen to talk to that day for the first time in several months. And my fiance, in my dream, was actually a boy whom I had known for several weeks a year or so previously, and had not thought of since that time.

Answers to questions
2. There was really a lack of emotion during the dream; apathy would probably best describe how I felt.

Two girl friends and myself, dressed in bathing suits, entered Hotel C. by the Public Square entrance, and crowded into a self-operated elevator to go to the 10th floor. There was already another person in the elevator, who wanted to get off at the 8th floor. There was some difficulty with the push button, and, after going up, we started to descend again. There was a moment of confusion after which the elevator began its slow ascent again. I had a sensation of claustrophobia.
The swimming pool was in amphitheatre arrangement, with tiers of seats that sloped down to the pool itself. The water, however, looked heavy and thick, and was of a deep blue-green black color, altogether unpleasant. Ahead of my friends, I went down the right aisle to the pool. I started to dive in, but a scream from my friends stopped me; they explained to me that there were five baby pigs at the end of the pool. To get to the other side, it was necessary to go back up the step-aisle and pass in front of the spectators scattered around the "theatre." Among them were several boys of my own age, who guffawed loudly at the mistake I had made. With heavy sarcasm and some anger I "fraw hawed" back at them. When I had passed, I had the uneasy feeling that they must have thought I was crazy.

At the left end I dived into the pool, and to be sure I did not encounter the pigs, followed a girl in a yellow bathing suit who was swimming in front of me. The pool was divided into several sections by what resembled a clothes rope. I continually entangled myself in these ropes as I tried to swim over them. At this point of the dream I learned that the little pigs were a part of a game provided by the management for its guests; if somebody swam into or near the "pig pen," the crib arrangement in which they were kept would overturn and they would be at freedom in the pool, and swimmers in turn, would be forced to use the pigs' former crib if they did not want to swim with the pigs.

Interpretation
This dream followed a whole day of intensive study with out a break. I still had not finished my work, however and as I went to bed I worried about finishing it. This may have some bearing on the dream.

The swimming I believe hinges on the fact that twice a week, for an hour or so, I swim at the C. Club. There is a self-operated elevator there, which also has a tendency to get stuck.

The incident of being ridiculed by the boys, I imagine, is my fear of that very thing.

The amphitheatre arrangement may be explained by the fact that I have lately been a spectator myself at several swim meets, looking down from the side to the pool.

It was an especially bleak day and I was walking with a friend of mine (girl) along the path around W Park Lagoon. I was carrying a flat, blunted rock. My friend stepped down from the path to test the ice in the lagoon, and I realized I was tired of carrying the rock. I let it go, and without my intending it to, it struck my friend in the back. She fell to the ice, evidently unconscious, and a deep, black hole appeared in her back. I had a feeling of horror but helplessness. At this point of the dream events became confused, but when they cleared, I was lying on the path, pretending either that I was ill or had fainted, and several of my friends (girls, whom I remember as knowing but cannot now identify) was standing around me, discussing how I should be punished for having injured my friend.
Interpretation
To hit my friend with a rock, even if accidentally done in the dream, would probably indicate repressed hostility toward her, although I can think of no reason for that feeling. Pretending to be unconscious, as an escape mechanism, seemed to be a familiar feeling in the dream. Perhaps it stems from an occasion when I was in elementary school, and, being pelted by snowballs from a tomboy school acquaintance, fell down in a snowbank and pretended to have been injured. This dream recalled the incident to my mind after having forgotten about it for several years.

Answers to questions
2. Surprise and horror at having injured my friend; fear of results.

6. No, except to be conscious of bleakness of day and surroundings.

This is a dream which I believe I have had, in some form or another, at another time; I experienced the "This is where I came in" feeling throughout it.
Several girl friends and myself were driving home from downtown. I was sitting on somebody's lap and feeling in good spirits; one of the girls, however, was sound asleep, her head resting against a window.

The home at which we arrived was at the top of a hill on a very wooded, mountainous section of Virginia. I was standing on the porch (complete with white pillars) and there was a young soldier with me. I had the feeling he was one of the "test tube" soldiers of Ft. Knox; he was very young and wearing a clean, well-pressed uniform, and had red hair. I believe we were waiting for breakfast. He said something to me, and we went to the back of the house. It seems he has wanted to burn rubbish, but the fire had spread to the whole hill, and to hills beyond. There was a great deal of smoke in the air, but I could see no fire.

We returned to the house. In the front center hall, when we entered, was a discussion as to what to do. A woman evidently the owner, decided to open the paddock to free the horses, so somebody, with several dogs, set them free.

In the next action I was a spectator, and the dream took on a motion-picture semblance. The horses were fleeing wildly, and there were several palaminoes I noticed especially.

Interpretation
All I can really explain is about the soldier and the fire. I had read several articles at that time of the Fort Knox experiment, which interested me.

The fire, I believe, is more important. When I was much younger I used to have nightmares about fire, always in our own home. A fire would start in our attic, I would dream, and sweep thru the house, destroying everything.

This fear of fire I can trace to two sources: first, that my father often became angry with me when he found my toys strewn about the attic, and he often mentioned the possibility of fire. Secondly, for many years our house was next to a wooded, grassy field where field fires in dry summer were a potential danger. My childhood dreams of a fire were very vivid and terrifying and on at least one occasion I got out of bed and went to the attic to see if all was well.

I think probably the above dream was that old fear in a new garb.

The dream was a brief one, but caused me a great deal of anxiety. I dreamed it was a Wednesday afternoon, and I was scheduled to attend two things at four o'clock: a water safety course and a sorority meeting. I decided, however, that I wanted to go home and did so. At six o'clock, however, I was horrified; I had failed to attend a water safety class upon which my summer job depended, and a sense of obligation told me I should have attended the meeting.
Even after I awoke, I felt a sense of anxiety over my escapist action.

Interpretation
Toward the end of every semester I begin to dream of two things; of cutting classes or forgetting to attend them and being penalized for it and of being unable to remember a single thing on the final examination.

Actually, I have been faced with the above problem of two important activities scheduled at the same time, and my dream decision of chucking the both by at once and deciding to go home, probably indicates wishful thinking of the same.

Supposedly next summer, I had returned to the camp where I actually counseled last summer, although it did not in the least resemble that place, but rather my aunt's farm in Virginia, which is in rolling country. There were only four or five of us counselors there and we were to organize a pre-camp training course. I cannot now remember the other dream characters, (although I knew them in the dream) except one who is a friend of mine here at school. It was a very rainy, dark, dreary day when we arrived, and while we were unpacking, when our camp director assigned us jobs and I was to gather firewood, I asked, intending to be facetious, "dry firewood?" When the director looked scornful at that remark, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. As I unpacked my unusually large suitcase I discovered at the bottom dozens of candles of all sizes. I did not know why they were there, but realized they would be useful at the "final banquet," a tradition and quite an occasion.
I also discovered many sweaters -- sweaters I have had for years, and I was glad to see them, for I was cold and wet. As I stood there, in my slip, I looked down the hill to the road and saw a man in an automobile driving past and staring up at me. It made me quite angry.

Interpretation
I have been preparing to return to camp this summer, and during the week of this dream had been busy filling out application blanks and writing to counselors I had known there last year. The directyor in the dream has since resigned and been replaced. The feeling of inadequacy with her I had occasionally felt, but it was not a constant feeling.

Candles seem to be a source of anxiety--for some reason it seems I am constantly having to get them for occasions; parties, concerts, birthdays, etc., and very often have forgotten them or been unable to buy them. They may have represented a feeling of frustration. Firewood seems to be another frustration symbol, for keeping it dry was of prime importance, and I was often mildly bothered about it at camp, fearing it would get wet and we would be unable to have a fire.

I was walking down a ramp with a strong feeling of having done something of great importance. As I walked along, one woman said to another (although I was not conscious of seeing either) that mine would have made the sixth abdication in a century. I had a feeling then of belonging to English royalty.
As I went into the street, it was raining, and I had to walk carefully, for it was very slippery. It was at night, and the lights from the shops on the streets reflected on the wet pavement. I began to cry, and a friend of mine came up to me to beg me not to commit suicide. I assured her that I wouldn't, saying that a five-minute walk in the rain would fix me up completely. I then lay down on the pavement and cried and cried.

Interpretation
My act of abdication produced in me a most intense feeling somewhere between the martyristic and brave "I can take it" attitude. My friend who begged me not to commit suicide, I realize, has appeared before in a minor part in a recent dream. I do not know why, for I see her seldom, and am not on intimate terms with her, although we have known each other since kindergarten days.

The walking down a ramp, which I was sure it was although it more resembled the balcony in my high school gym, is not surprising, for the day before the dream I had ushered at two operas and had been stationed on one of the auditorium ramps.

There was a young girl, whom I judged to be about seven years old and whom I felt was a playmate of my sister (although my sister is now sixteen), visiting our house. She was a very ragged, dirty and unkempt child, which bothered me considerably. I took her to her home, which was the lower half of a double house on a street not far from ours, and found the place in a deplorable messy condition. We went through several rooms, all of which seemed to be furnished in living-room style, to the kitchen in the back. The kitchen too, was in an abhorrable state; dishes of food from several previous meals was lying around, which rather nauseated me. Just inside the door of the dining room was the refrigerator ("x"). [There is a diagram in the original dream report.] I peered into it, and the heat from the inside hit me in the face. It was revolting, I thought, to have butter and milk and eggs kept in a warm icebox! The little girl, meanwhile, had been unobtrusively following me around. I thought a splendid thing to do would be to clean the whole place thoroughly, and I had the feeling that by doing so I would greatly impress someone whom I wanted to make a good impression upon.
Evidently we made a good job of it, for the little girl thanked me profusely, and mentioned that her older brothers, as well as the two boys who lived upstairs, would certainly admire me for doing such a good job of cleaning!

Interpretation
The young girl reminded me of a schoolmate I had in the first year or two of elementary school. She had about the same appearance as my dream child, and although I never knew of her home life, I knew she was one of six children. Often I would bring her home from school to have lunch with me, and once I gave her a penny that my "boy friend" had given me. (I had not thought of this for years; thinking about the dream brought back these incidents).

To clean up a place in such a condition as her home was would probably be my natural tendency to do so; perhaps the dream indicates that I really want to be admired for this tendency.

I was standing on our upstairs back porch watching some sort of an air show in the sky. Although it was night, I could see a blimp in its entirety, silver-colored, and a legend or advertisement or news bulletins running around it. I squinted and peered to try to read what it was, but could not.
There were several airplanes sky-writing, and doing it in a very graceful sweeps across the sky. I also tried to read what they were writing, but the smoke evaporated or disintegrated before I could read the words.

In spite of all this aerial activity, there was no noise. I then became cold and sat in the corner of the porch, huddled up, trying to keep warm.

Interpretation
Earlier in the evening of the dream I had seen the Goodyear blimp which has lately been floating over C. at night, flashing news reels along its side in Times-Square fashion, so, obviously, that is where the "dream blimp" came from.

My not being able to read it probably springs from the fact that I am near--sighted and would not be able to see it without my glasses. I have noticed in other dreams, however, when trying to read a book the print sort of melts away before I can see what it says.

The sky-writing of the planes, which was fluffy, pastel-colored stuff, may have come from a package of shipping-cream dye I had bought that day. And I awakened shortly after the dream to find I had kicked the covers off, which explains my feeling cold in the dream.

I was in a long, rather elaborate corridor which was brilliantly lighted by crystal chandeliers. There was a punch table around which many people were gathered, and groups were standing and walking around, giving an impression of constant activity. This was, I knew, a fraternity social affair. My date, however, seemed constantly to run off, returning later but giving me an uneasy feeling of being left alone. One of his quick trips back to me, he asked "how's O.?" and I felt surprised that he should know O.
I met a girl who was also alone, and the two of us went back to an elaborate lounge. After some muddled activity, I was back in the living room of my own home, and the mother of a friend (boy) of mine was asking me to give her a wide silver filigree bracelet that I own.

Interpretation
In retrospect this dream seems to be confusingly active; the activity, that is, of people constantly milling around. The corridor-like setting seemed very large, but because of the many people, was not vast.

My date, I presumed in the dream, was gotten for me by a friend of mine who is actually in the fraternity, and whose mother it was who later asked me for the bracelet. I do not know how I know it was his mother in the dream, for I have met her but once, and would not recognize her if I saw her again, I am sure. My surprise at being asked "how O. was" springs from the fact that I did not know that my date was not gotten for me by my fraternity friend, but my date was instead a friend of O. O., incidentally, is my "unrequited."

At a social gathering, seemingly in somebody's attic, I was introduced to a man with whom I danced, a person whom I have seen in school but do not know. At an intermission there was some sort of a program in which three girls, dressed in formal gowns, sang, sitting down. They were quite informal about it, giggling and glancing about as they sang. One girl I vaguely know as being in one of my classes, was wearing a yellow formal--the only color in the dream. One of the girls has moved recently to California (the two vaguely physically resemble one another). On the other side of the trio, still another girl (B) got up and left, saying she felt embarrassed because her skirt was too short.
The couple with whom my partner and I were evidently double-dating, was a high school friend of mine who has since married and whom I have not seen since her wedding. As we drove home from the dance my dancing partner changes to a youth whom I have never seen. As he left me at my door in broad daylight, he hastily shook my hand, as I opened the door, and left. My mother was awaiting me at the top of the stairs.

Interpretation
On the day of this dream I had looked forward to a call from the fellow with whom I have gone rather steadily for several months, realizing that if I did not hear from him, I would probably not see him again. As he did not call, I began to search about in my mind for someone to take to a forthcoming dance. Probably in my dream, I was continuing to do the same thing. My dancing partner, although I do not actually know his marital status, probably in that he was married during the dream, represents some sort of a guilt feeling.

I had been married two days and, at the time, was cleaning a house which I did not recognize as any I had ever been in before, but one in which I felt perfectly comfortable. My mother was directing me, as she does at home, and I was working vigorously. I had no idea, at this time, of anyone else in my family, such as Dad or my 2 older brothers. I hadn't seen my husband for 2 days, but I felt that I could make it up to him and I was determined to try.
Interpretation
The idea of marriage has been mentioned frequently in my dorm; and, I remember we were discussing its possibilities the night before. Mother's position in my dream was probably due to the fact I know she doesn't want me to marry till I'm through college.

I was on a desert with a group of people. Although I knew the people were there, they seemed like phantoms because I could not recognize them. One girl (I couldn't recognize her) and I went dashing around on the sand, having a gay carefree time. Another girl (who I couldn't recognize) tried hard to annoy me, and she made me angry for which I rebuked her.
Interpretation

I dreamed I was on the shore of a small lake with a hill rising about ten feet in back of me. A girl was with me and one I did know. A "C.B." type of plane was stunting over the water and headed straight towards the girl and I. I was afraid and ran to the hill and back against it, but my friend was not afraid and she stayed by the shore; the plane zoomed up just in time to miss the hill. Then the plane landed and two men, rather good looking but none I'd seen before, stepped from the plane into a small boat and rowed towards us. Next scene we were in a hotel and they were there--here I woke up.
Interpretation
I can think of no reason to dream this other than the fact I ate some cheese just before retiring, which has been the cause of some peculiar dreams before. I am interested in flying and the C.B. is my favorite type plane.

I was attending a dance and I have no recollection of having known my date, yet I know I arrived at the dance with one. The impression I remember is my being the center of attraction of all the dancing couples, standing in the middle of floor drinking bottle after bottle of soda pop. The dream had the aspect of a Hollywood operetta with lavish surroundings.
Interpretation

I dreamed I had been walking for hours, but I wasn't tired. The scenery never seemed to change; it was always the same large homes, unkept and musty. I wanted desperately to find some other scenery, but mile after mile showed the same result. I could see myself, too, during the dream and although I was anxious inwardly my face was calm and showed no emotion.

I dreamed I was at a huge party in some palacial ballroom that I have never seen before. The party seemed to be in my honor and I stood out in the crowds of people as if spotlights were playing on me at all times. No one came near me for there was a circle of about 15 feet where no one stood, about me and yet I was vastly happy. It reminded me of a scene in Il Trovadore during the duet.

I was at a beach party with many people I knew, yet I felt lonely because the fellow I had come with had gone back to the car for something forgotten. It was a very black night with a haze over the water about 1/4 of a mile out. I wanted to swim into the haze and I knew I was a good enough swimmer to do it, but I was afraid of what was beyond the haze. I swam out to it and forced myself to go into it. It covered me like a blanket and I quickly returned to shore really afraid.
Interpretation
I like to swim and in the water I like to go far and it pleases me to make other people get mad or anxious by doing this. I know I'm a good enough swimmer not to drown and it's one silly way of getting attention; but more than that, I personally feel I've accomplished something by swimming a great distance than I have a slight fear of drowning.

I dreamed I was dancing at a ballroom I have been to and that I was having a wonderful time. All of a sudden, practically all of the people I have met in the last year within a certain crowd came in. Then I became panicky for the fellow I was dancing with, was not the boy this crowd knew that I went with. I was terribly afraid someone would tell the other fellow I was unfaithful. I felt trapped, as if I was trying desperately to escape from an enclosure of steel.
Interpretation
Lately, I have been discussing the merits of "going steady," "being pinned," and "married" with my roommates, boy friend (I hate those two words) and mother. If I went by dreams, I guess I shouldn't consent to go steady for I seem to figure it to be a restriction.

I dreamed I was attending a concert at a place resembling the interior of the Hama. I was enthralled by the music which was strictly classical and had more volume than melody, yet the piece was not heavy. I was conscious of the others in the audience, but of no other single person. The music was extremely vivid, but I canlt remember the time and I don't believe I have ever heard the piece before. I had a feeling the concert lasted a long time.

Then suddenly my father tried to choke me to death. He was very composed. He showed no emotion while choking me. I wasn't afraid of death, but of my father. To be a little clearer, I was more afraid of having made my father angry, then being killed myself.

A girl came up to talk to me and accidently made a faux-pax by saying she had been on a date with G., my steady. G. heard her and made no explanation, but looked only hostile. Unseen, I left the dinner party and walked out the front door of Dr. Bacon's house at the P. Andy, a fellow I had dated came walking up the driveway smiling. Even though I knew he could help me, I walked around the house away from him.

I dreamed that J---(M 22--engaged to me) and I went to visit two of our friends who were just married. They were living in an old house similar to one I visited when a child. G--- (M 23)was sitting in the living room and there were two huge rats sitting in front of the fire place. I said something to M--- L--- (F 23) about the house and she said "you should have seen it before we moved in. Then one of the rats jumped into G---'s lap.
Interpretation
The dream probably grew out of a letter I had just received from M--- L---. I am not too fond of G--- and I guess I class him with big ugly rats.

J--- (engaged to M 22) and I were on our way E--- Beach but first we had to meet several women (F 60-70). These older women were sitting on a sofa with their heads cut off. We went up some stairs and got into a roller coaster car. The tracks were covered with small fire crackers which started to go off when we came to the end of the ride. We got back in the car and some-one called to us and asked us to take a boy we had never seen before to the doctor. Several other young people (20-25) got into the car and I woke up.
Interpretation
The women with their heads cut off probably gained entrance into my dream by the plate in my art book of the statue of the three fates. The fire crackers at E--- Beach came from my memory of the times my parents used to take me there on the Fourth of July. The young people were probably just the wish to meet more young people.

I went out of the house and got into a boat and sailed back and forth in front of the wide windows. Suddenly there was thunder and rain. The house melted away. The woman who owned the house--(the mother of one of my friends) drove her car to the river's edge and I got in. There was another clap of thunder and I awoke.
Interpretation
The setting of the dream probably originated from the pictures of some of Frank Lloyd Wright's houses which I had been looking at before I went to bed. The mother of my friend probably originated in my dream because while at school I saw the plans of a building designed by Wright whlch they have bought and are planning to build soon. The thunder was probably the sound of the truck backing into our drive just before I awoke.

I dreamed I was in a dlfferent city with J. and his sister (F 35). I was buying formals and was wearing my hair piled up on my head. The formal I liked the best was a white lace dress with long sleeves.
Interpretation
I was rather angry with myself when I went to bed and I believe the dream was the wish to be a different person (clothes make the woman idea). The white dress may also have been symbolic of a wedding dress and the desire to get married.

In my dream I was trying to buy colored blocks to fit into a wall panel I was able to buy and fit all the blocks except one with out which the whole design would fall apart.
Interpretation
The general plan of the dream may have come from the difficulty I have had working with the panel in a radio cabinet J. and I are building or a game of chinese checkers I played before going to bed. The one block that wouldn't fit was probably an expression of an Id impulse against the formal design.

I was in a foreign land living in a strange house with a very blonde girl. All of my friends seemed to live in this country too. There were two troops of soldiers also in the town who were friendly with each other although they seemed to be from different nations. one troop dressed in white uniforms and wore black turbans while the other troop wore khaki. My fiance belonged to the khaki group of soldiers. For some unknown reason the troops began to fight and those in khaki formed two lines--the first kneeling, and the second standing behind them. This made a perfect target for the troop in white, and in the fight my fiance was shot and killed. When I heard, I was grief stricken and especially because I was unhappy living with the blonde girl, and also had received bad news from my mother. The blonde continually stole my potato chips which angered me. The bad news was that my dog was very ill and my uncle had given him a blood transfusion. I was very upset.
Another elderly man had also given blood for my dog although the animal was not expected to live. (My uncle has been dead for about 8 years and he was about 71 when he died. He was not a blood relative, but lived for years with my mother's family and I always called him Uncle. He was very kind to me. The other elderly gentleman I cannot identify. My dog has been dead about 1-1/2 years and was 12 years old when he died. I cannot identify the blonde girl, but She was my age in the dream. My fiance is 23 years old.)

Interpretation
My fiance is away at school which may account for the foreign place. I may fear subconsciously, that he will be taken from me by another girl--symbolized by his death and my stolen potatoe chips, which in reality I like to eat. Perhaps I look on my mother as a bearer of bad news who adds one trouble to one already established.

Answers to questions
2. I felt anger towards the girl, frustration upon the death of my fiance and I was anxious over my dog's illness.
3. Both--I could see myself & yet I felt I was doing the acting.
4. Unpleasant
5. A foreign place. I was at times in a strange house (where I was living) and other times I was on the street.

This is only a snatch of a dream. I was walking down S--- Avenue at dusk when a colored man jumped out of a doorway and pulled me back into the shadows of a dime store's entrance. He began to molest me while I fought wildly and called to the passers-by for help. The people walking past were people I knew, but I cannot identify them. They looked at me as if nothing was happening, waved and smiled, and walked on.
Interpretation
In reality I probably miss the attentions of my fiance who is away at school and in order to stick to my principles I disguise any cravings in my dream in the form of an attack under very repulsive conditions. The people therefore seem to see me with my fiance and don't think anything is wrong. I have always disliked dime stores intensely since I worked in one a few times, and this setting also adds to my fear and distaste.

I dreamed I was in a Speech Class at M--- and the girl in front of me kept fidgeting & told the teacher not to call on her as she was too nervous. Next I was in a class which was electing some committees. I remember seeing the words, "Christmas" and "Easter" on the board, and I couldn't see any reason for having to hold the election. We all dropped what we were doing & went outside. There was a beach and a bunch of girls & fellows were either building something out in the water or else were trying to hold a picnic on a sand bar. I seemed to be on the committee for the gathering and was called to the phone. It was some boy's mother, & she kept talking continuously & seemed interested in Boy Scouts. Meanwhile everyone was busy carrying things to the sand bar. By the time I finished talking all the work was done, & I remember going out in a boat with a gang. It was dark and the waves were high. Somehow I found myself in a bedroom which in the dream was supposed to be my girlfriend's bedroom. It was quite cluttered up, particularly the top of the dresser, and I was disgusted with the condition of it. The wallpaper was of huge red rose design. (In reality the girlfriend, who is 20 years old, has an entirely differently decorated room--although she is rather careless with her belongings.)
Interpretation
Perhaps this dream is concerned with my classes, for the day before I had the dream, I had a speech class & was told I was to prepare a speech for the next meeting. I do not like to make speeches. In another class we elected class officers, and I felt like it was extremely unnecessary to do it in college. As to the rest of the dream I can see no significance unless perhaps I feel I am being held back from being in a group by someone represented by the woman talking to me on the phone.

I dreamed I was in a very small general store with my fiance. In came the brother of a fellow I used to go with before I met my fiance. The brother is about 14 years old now, but he seemed older in the dream. He showed me some money he had gotten on a trip. It was foreign money, and I felt it came from some island in the South Seas. The name on it was something like Madeira. This brother told me that P--- his brother was home now.
Interpretation
This dream may have been caused by the fact that the college where my ex-boyfriend is a student was coming to C--- for a football game, & I thought perhaps the fellow would also be in town to see the game.

My fiance asked me if I minded going to the same restaurant again for dinner. I said it was all right with me. We went down a hilly business section of a small town and in the valley was the restaurant. It was called the "L--- F---" or something similar. On either side of the door were scenes from a desert showing cacti and Joshua trees. We went in & sat down temporarily at a table with some strange people. They weren't very congenial, and we didn't like sitting with them, so as soon as an empty table was available, we moved. While we were attempting to order, three older people pushed in on us and sat down at the table too. My fiancee had to sit on the edge of his seat for the woman piled her belongings, especially a big round purse, on his chair. The people were very friendly, but we wanted to eat alone and were quite upset. After eating, we went through a door and walked up an incline inside a building. I waited on the crest of the incline while my fiance went into another room. Soon he & a huge crowd of people swept out of the room. All were dressed as Hollanders and yet spoke Spanish. They were all happy and excited and eager to be on their way. My fiance spoke Spanish fluently with them, and I was perturbed because I could only speak a few words, although I understood them. They were going down to Mexico and were so happy. I remember trying to say in Spanish "I wish I could go." I kept saying "Quiero _______"--can't recall the second word. My fiance stood with me talking to them & I kept saying "Quiero _______."
Interpretation
I can't interpret the beginning of the dream, but perhaps the ending of it symbolizes the desire I have to travel. I spent some time at school in A--- & always have wished to return someday. My fiance & I both plan to go there together. We have both taken Spanish, but not enough to speak fluently.

I dreamed I was at a recording dance. It was either in a small room or barn. Not many people were there & I was just standing and watching as my fiance wasn't with me. I saw two fellows dancing who I recognized, but the girls with them were unknown. Both fellows went to high school with me and I knew them very well, although I have never gone out with either of them. The one is now engaged while the other is at A. I saw a M. girl dancing and although she's engaged, she was not with her fiance. I wished I could dance too and felt since the fellows were old frlends they could have asked me to be nice, but they didn't. I couldn't see how the girl was able to dance when I couldn't.
Interpretation
I miss not being able to go to dances and other activities since my fiance is away at school. This loneliness shows up in my dreams. Either that or the fact that I went to a tea dance as I had to be a hostess and perhaps feel guilty because I danced one dance with a strange fellow.

I was in a huge school gym which resembled the one I used for handcraft on a playground while directing this summer. I was wrapping packages and decorating them. Others who I cannot recognize were doing the same thing. We found a decoration for a package which we thought was wonderful and beautiful. It was simply pasting one narrow piece of tape (dark colored) in the middle of a wider piece of tape like this: This was a great idea in the dream. Someone who I was familiar with, but can't recall now, criticized my wrapping and I felt bad and angry too. I also remember placing a candle in each corner of a package for design like this:
I saw the words "Medicine inside--Handle with care" on boxes. It seemed to be concerned with the Pharmaceutical Co. my father works for as I talked with his boss. Everyone left except me and I kept wrapping. A colored girl came in to clean and then a colored man. I heard him say to the colored girl that he was going to pick all the pockets of the coats and the pocket books before the people returned to work. I was furious and tried to stop him, but he smiled and pushed me violently away. I forgot to say earlier that in order to wrap the packages we had to lick the tape. It tasted so bad and my mouth became sticky and dry, so that I could hardly swallow. It was awfully frightening and uncomfortable too.

Interpretation
The gym has been identified. I can't see the significance of the packages, although I had been at my fiance's for dinner and we ate by 4 candles. We mentioned the lovely design reflected on the ceiling. My fiance wanted more light to eat by, so we put on the electric lights. However he had eaten the night before with me at my house by 5 candles and said then that it was fine. We all commented on this. My fiance and I had used my parents' car during the day, and we had to park it unlocked. This worried me as it was loaded with some medicine, and I knew my Dad wouldn't like it if he knew, because of the chance of theft. Perhaps this accounts for the threat of theft by the colored man. As to the dry taste in my mouth, I can't interpret it. I have had this dream of a dry mouth which hinders swallowing and finally leads to a feeling of not being able to get my breath many times. It is always very vivid and frightening.

I dreamed I was in the upstairs of a double house visiting one of my girl friends. She is 20 yrs. old and I've known her about 10 years. The house was strange. I was afraid of some Indians out in the back yard who were after me for some reason. I was frightened, but solved the problem by having my father (who was evidentally with me) back the car out to the front, and I sneaked out the front door without being seen by the Indians. Next I found myself walking through a department store on the way to an offlce. I stopped and looked at clothes and talked to someone I knew, but can't remember now. I was all dressed up and seemed to be there for an interview for a job. I wore my fur coat, a square fur hat--which impressed me for it was so stylish; and also I wore a silk scarf which I remember. I sat in the office as if I was extremely confident. I talked to a young girl and an older woman sat to one side observing me and taking notes. I seemed to be on a higher social level than either in the office.
Interpretation
The evening I had the dream I had visited my girl friend with my parents. We stayed quite late, so I had to stay up even later when I got home to finish The Prairie by Cooper, which was due the next day: This book is about Indians and their wars and friendships with white settlers. I was worrled I wouldn't finish the book, but I did. Thus I got away from the Indians. My sister just started working with my girlfriend B. who told me how she was getting along. My sister has had 3 yrs. of college and is now in an office with girls who have had none--thus she feels rather superior to the job as a whole. I identified myself with my sister in my dream, for I'd like to be able to work to have money to buy some clothes, but I can't when I'm in school. The feeling of superiority is something I don't wish to have. My fur coat just came out of storage that afternoon, thus I have it on in the dream.

I dreamed I was driving a car. It seemed I was sitting up high and close to the steering wheel. At times the car had only two wheels and other times it resembled a bike. I was driving very fast and confidently. I don't remember who was with me, but I was not alone. It seems I was driving around the block in front of my fiance's house and also in front of my girlfriend's house. My fiance is 23 and the girl is 20.

I dreamed I was sitting on the front porch of our cottage. It was dreary and rainy outside. I saw my Aunt sitting on a swing which hung from the ceiling (We do not have any such swing). She had a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on which fitted down over her nose in a peculiar muzzle-like way. I remember particularly a piece of the contraption fitted down the nose, following an indentation between the nostrils, like this. In a wicker stand were some plants which we were admiring. All at once the plants heaved upward, and a pig emerged oinking loudly. We all laughed and thought the pig was darling. We became very attached to the animal.
Interpretation
My Aunt has a slight dimple in her nose, but nothing compared to the one in the dream. I can't figure out why she would be wearing such glasses or what it would symbolize. The first pair of glasses I had were gold rimmed & I have always disliked having to wear glasses. I seemed to grow to like the pig as I liked our dog which died about 2 years ago. We had the dog for 12 years and he always loved our cottage. We buried him out at the cottage & perhaps the emergence of the pig from the flower box is symbolic of our dog's grave.

I dreamed I had helped my mother rearrange the living room. She had company in and when we all went into the living room I saw that she had put the furniture back in its original position. I was absolutely furious & hurt to think that I had spent my whole day rearranging the room only to find that Mother had switched the furniture around when my back was turned. I told her just what I thought of this in front of the company. I was very frank and brazen about it.

I dreamed I was with a strange fellow climbing up steep steps to get to a seat in a theater. I saw two friends of my mother's. These women (about 50 yrs. old) were made up quite extremely & I felt a great distaste for them. For some reason or other the curtain was half up. I could see an actor In a red room climb into a coffin. Although I realized it was only a stage setting, I felt frightened & turned to my companion for assurance. We left almost at once as if the play were over. We walked down many, many stairs which were covered all the way down with an awning of green stripes. When we got outside we could look back & see the different landings of the steps covered with one huge awning. Each landing led to an exclusive night club. There were about 5 neon signs.
Interpretation
I seemed to be very attracted to the strange fellow altho I realized I was engaged to someone else. This would seem to indicate I'm not happy about my engagement which I can't seem to fit at all. Perhaps this stranger was merely a substitution for my fiance. We had been to the Pu-- A--- several nights previously & had to climb steep steps. We saw "Desert Song" in which the hero wore red. At the entrance of the A--- was a green & white awning for it was snowing badly. My fiance & I haven't been to a night club for quite a while because he is away at school & when he comes home we have other things more important to do. Besides it is expensive.

I dreamed I was upstairs in H--- Hall making a phone call to a girlfriend. (She is 20) At times I seemed to be in a bedroom & at other times the hall was being used as a dining hall. There was a large, long table at which many M--- girls were sitting. I kept talking on the phone & the girls at the table kept calling for me to come eat. Then the scene was again changed to a bedroom & I was still on the phone. All at once some girl came bounding through my room on her hands & feet, like an ape. I thought she was just kidding & then another girl stuck her head in the door & and said "Did you see her?" I told her I had & asked if she were just being silly. She said, "No, she's always like that!"
Interpretation
The setting was H--- Hall because I've spent so much time there practicing for S--- Night. It also accounts for the large group of girls. The girl I was calling lives at H--- so I can't understand why I was calling her at some other place. I had tried to call her one night this week from my home & she was out.

I dreamed I had a girl over for dinner. The girl is 20 & I know her fairly well as she is in my class. After dinner, I told her I hoped she enjoyed being at my house to eat. She said the food was fine, but that she had not had enough water. She said my father "hogged" the water pitcher & drank so much that when she wanted some it was all gone. She enumerated other things which weren't done the way her family does them. I can't remember what they were but I felt pretty bad about it.
Interpretation
I can't understand this at all. The girl has never been to my house. She needs a flashlight for a stunt she's in & I told her I would lone her my father's when I saw her this afternoon.

When I returned to my aunt she was still talking to the football player. I was amazed to find her so interested in the fellow as he was not the polished, refined typed which she approves of.

I dreamed I was working in a department store with people I had gone to high school with. During my lunch hour I went to a library with my girlfriend (21 yrs.) to get a book out. I had to walk uphill. In the library I found a book which I needed for a class at some school. It was a reference book so I hunted for another copy. The book seemed to be about King Arthur, but it was only to be found in the F. room. Along with the books were also pots and pans on the shelves. After working we waited on the corner for the bus. I saw among the group two fellows who I knew very well and were good friends in high school. They admired my engagement ring.
Interpretation
I imagine that returning to school reminded me of my high school days. The idea that I was working probably arises from the fact that I'm anxious to finish school and work for a change. Perhaps the pots and pans symbolize marriage for I also plan to marry after graduation. I have been getting things together that I will need for keeping house.

I had been waiting a long time for some duck eggs to hatch. There were 13. I didn't count them but I knew there were 13. As I watched, twelve of the eggs began to crack open and pieces of the shells were scattered all over. Then, just as the tops of the little ducks' heads appeared, all activity stopped and I knew they were all dead.
I took one egg that was left and moved it to the side of the nest away from the others. Then it cracked open and a little duck emerged. I picked it up in my hand and put it in a bucket of water to teach it to swim.

I was attending a tea party with eight other women (all aged between 40 and 60). They were teachers from the school where I teach. The principal was also there (F-40). She was very angry with all of us teachers because we had gone to the party and left our classes alone in the rooms. But we just let her fume and we went on having a good time.
Then, later, I wss walking back to my classroom and I stopped to read a notice on the bulletin board. It read, "Room 109, (my room) 1st grade, may use the gym at 4:08 each day."

Interpretation
I think both parts are wish-fulfillment. The first part is a desire to openly defy the principal. She is a fussy, finicky woman and I often feel like "telling her off" but I never have.

My sister (22) came to my room and told me that she was going to divorce my brother-in-law. I don't remember her telling me why; I believe she just said she was going to get a divorce. I was very unhappy and I cried and cried.
Interpretation
This could mean that I am envious of the fact that my sister married before I did although she is younger than I am. My unhappiness or anxiety in the dream could have been caused by the conflict between this repressed jealousy and the idea that such thoughts are wrong and wicked.

My boyfriend (23) had asked me to marry him and I had said that I would, although I didn't want to do so, and had no intention of going through with it. I kept hoping that something would happen so that I wouldn't have to marry him. But nothing did, and the day of the wedding finally arrived. I was frantic because no arrangements had been made. I went dashing around in a long white dress and a veil inviting people to the wedding. Then I was inside the building where the ceremony was to take place. I didn't know what to do, but I was determined not to marry him, so I pretended to faint.

I was walking along a path which ran beside a broad, calm river. Then the path turned away fromthe river and ran through a thick forest. The forest began to grow thicker and darker. I was frightened, but something compelled me to walk on. Suddenly, I was out of the woods and standing at the edge of a large open space. In the middle of this clearing I saw a beautiful house. It was a large, white house with blue awnings at the windows, and three white pillars at the front. Hundreds of yellow roses were climbing around the pillars. It was a lovely scene, but it was very frightening. I wanted to go back, but something seemed to draw me toward the house. Then, as I came close to it, the whole house began to tremble and collapse. I turned and began to run toward the forest. Before I reached it, I awoke. Even after I awoke, it took a long time to get rid of the feeling of terror.

I was walking along the top of a mountain when suddenly a chasm opened before me. It happened so quickly that I couldn't stop. I started to fall, but the chasm wasn't very wide and I managed to stop my fall by bracing my feet against one wall and my shoulders against the other. Then I looked down, and it seemed as though I could see down for at least a mile. At the bottom were a lot of tiny houses. I was terribly frightened, because I was growing tired and I knew I would soon fall. I woke up then, but every time I closed my eyes I could see that long drop. I finally had to get a book and read a while before I could go back to sleep.

I was going somewhere on a streetcar. After I had been riding a while, a Negro friend of mine (M-25) got on the car and sat down beside me. We were talking about a class we had taken together. Then a tall, fat white man--a stranger about 50--came over and pointed a gun at my friend and forced him to get off the streetcar. The white man said it made him sick to see a negro talking to a white person. Then, as my friend was walking across the street, the man shot him in the back. I got off the car and ran over to him, but he was dead. I felt sad and I cried.

I was riding in a small airplane with my boyfriend (23). I was very much afraid because I was sure we were going to crash. Suddenly, the plane began to fall toward some trees. I screamed, and then my boyfriend changed into another friend of mine (M-28). Then we were out of the plane and walking around on the bottom of the ocean. It was very beautiful, and I felt quite happy. We were walking toward a large building which seemed to be a church. Then a soft sound of bells came from the church.

I was sitting out in the grass with my youngest sister (19). A queer animal - a cross between a spider and an octopus - started wrapping his tentacles around her neck. I tried to pull him away but I couldn't. Then I started cutting the tentacles with a pair of scissors. Finally I succeeded in removing it and dropping it into a pail of scalding water.

This dream took place in a small room - I don't know where - in which the O.W. Choir (of which I am a member) was congregated. We were rehearsing some popular pieces when a large group of women entered the room. As I remember, almost all of them seemed to be wearing furs. I kept getting up to offer my seat to them, but no one accepted it. The conductor changed the song immediately and we began to sing classical numbers. The women sat along a window sill, and I seemed to keep moving from chair to chair. The director then measured the length of our robes to see that they were three inches from the floor.
Interpretation
It seems that there must have been more to this dream, but I cannot recall anything further. The only connection which I can make is that I had recently thought of my choir director at school, as there is a high school music clinic going on there now. The idea of measuring our robes seems to revert back to high school, as our director insisted upon our robes being three inches from the floor. I find no connection to the women, or the idea of offering my seat.

Answers to questions
2. There was no particular emotion, as I cannot even recall the music.

I dreamed that I was sitting at a counter at the A. V. It was about 1:30 and I was to meet my mother downtown at 3:30. I was very hungry, but no one would wait on me. Then a sailor sat down beside me and put his arm around me. He seemed to be half asleep. I was very insulted, and immediately walked out. I then discovered I had a book of his which merely said "scrapbook" on the front. I decided to return it, but couldn't find him. I then saw a parade of sailors coming down the street. I wrote my name and address inside the book, and said I was sorry I had been so rude to him. I ran up beside one of the sailors (who was a girl) and asked if she could return it. She said she could locate him by the number on the book (which I had not noticed previously).
Interpretation
I can find no connection with the A. V.! I had previously visited a girlfriend who is engaged to a sailor, although I hadn't thought of him at all. The scrapbook might have been connected with the fact that I had left my notebook in class that day, and later found it. I find no meaning to the parade, meeting my mother, or the female sailor!

I dreamed that my home was a huge mansion, composed of five floors. My room was on the third floor, and was very small. I remember seeing that everything in it was pink, and it seemed to be long and very narrow. In the dream I found that my sister had a room on the fourth floor which was very huge and done up completely in green. I walked from room to room on the fourth floor, and found that many of my old friends were living in them. Who these friends were is a bit hazy now, but they were people I knew a long time ago. I was very jealous of my sister's room, and I thought it was horribly unfair of my mother not to let me have the room. I thought she should let us alternate using the room. This much is all I can remember.
Interpretation
I might interpret this dream by a feeling of jealousy towards my sister, but I have never felt this way. The only explanation I can find is that I sometimes say to my folks, "You let Marge do it when she was my age," in order to do something my folks dislike. Maybe this dream was my punishment! However, I definitely have no feelings of jealousy toward my sister. My room at present is done in pink, and my sister's room many years ago was in green. Why I dreamed of this or a mansion I don't know.

2. I felt perplexed, jealous, and a little angry.

At the beginning of this dream it took place in a hotel lobby. A friend of mine was standing at a desk, and presently she came over to me with something hidden inside her coat. It turned out to be chocolate, eggs, sugar, and all the ingredients necessary to make fudge. We ran upstairs with these things hidden. The building then seemed to be built like A Hall, and it seemed that we climbed about six flights of stairs. On the top floor we found there was a radio broadcast going on, so we had to sneak down again. There seemed to be about fifteen girls mingling around who eventually began to chase us. This is all I recall, except that at the end the ingredients were combined and we were running with a pan of fudge.
Interpretation
I often have a desire to make fudge around home, especially when home alone, I usually don't tell my folks when I make it, and perhaps that accounts for my trying to hide it in the dream. My first class at Reserve is in A. on the third floor, and perhaps this accounts for the climbing of stairs. As for the radio broadcast and the group of girls, I can't quite figure that out.

2. I felt excited, anxious, tired of running up the stairs.

This dream seemed to be especially long, and especially realistic. After I awoke I realized how absurd it really was. It began on a boat where someone had been murdered (a male). The murderer had wrapped a snake around the victim's neck. I was suspicious of a tall, dark, young man, who was not good looking but had a beautiful build. As I recall, his name was Wade. However, after I got to know him we fell very much in love, and combined our efforts to find the murderer. The next thing I recall is that we were walking down a road to a farmhouse. Someone there told us to follow a road to find the murderer. We walked down the road, and soon Wade was far ahead of me. The road divided and it seemed to be very misty. I couldn't find Wade. There were millions of people walking down the road and I passed a young fellow who had been on the boat. I asked him about Wade and he said he had just been killed. I came to a hurst with two policemen in it. There were curtains drawn all the way around it, and the policeman peeked through and said Wade was dead. I cried through the rest of the dream! I then came to in an airplane filled with tunnels and people. I overheard the pilot telling the murderer he would conceal the murderer in the wing. I then realized the murderer was the young man who had told me Wade was killed. My father then advised and I told him where the murderer was. This is the last I recall.
Interpretation
The only connection I can make to this dream is my worry about my boyfriend being short! (about my height) The prevalent thing in the dream was that Wade was tall. When I awoke I felt as though I had been crying all night. It took a long time to get this dream out of my mind. No one in the dream was familiar to me, except my father. I had never seen Wade before. The murderer wore a plaid sweater and was a good friend. I told my father who he was because I felt revengeful about Wade's death. I can't connect the airplane or boat or any of the people.

This dream was a very disconnected one. It began when I was riding in a car with my girlfriend's boyfriend. The two of them had had a fight. It seems that we drove for hours and hours. Later I got out of the car and started walking. A middle aged man picked me up and put my suitcase in the back of the car(!!) He kept giving me sly looks and I realized he was going to kidnap me. Five young men came down the street and walked straight towards me. I said, "Don't you dare take another step!" and they stopped. The next thing I knew I was in A------. I was walking with someone who was saying something to the Eskimos. It seemed that he was saying "oogie woogie" or some similar phrase such as that! I remember it was very cold and there was a sharp wind. I remember seeing a great deal of snow.
Interpretation
One connection I can make with this dream is that I had been driving quite a bit the day I had this dream. Possibly the idea of my being in A------ is also connected, as one of my girlfriend's fiancee is stationed there. Also, the girlfriend's boyfriend who was in the dream had really had a fight with his girl the day before. I can't explain the idea of being kidnapped or the five young men!

2. A little fright, but mainly no particular emotion.

This was rather a disconnected dream, and I'm sure there was more to it than I can remember. However, it took place in a rather barren room, which was evidently my living quarters. I had captured a tiger (!) and kept it stuffed in a large chest. The tiger knew something which I wanted to know, so I told him I would free him if he would tell me. The tiger had the face of a man, and stood on his hind legs. The last I remember, we were in a telephone booth together making an important phone call.
Interpretation
I can't think of any connection to this dream. I hadn't seen any Frank Buck movies, or given any thought to tigers! The tiger's face looked like that of a boy in my Psychology of Adolescence class This boy is always interrupting in class and monopolizing most of the class period.

2. Anxious. Whatever the information was that the tiger had, I was very eager to get it.
3. An actual participant

I was riding in a car with my boyfriend at D-------, O----. It was a Sunday afternoon and there were many 0--- W------ students walking around. We were going on a picnic and I was riding in the backseat while my boyfriend drove. We came to a steep hill which we couldn't get up. This hill suddenly changed to the hill at C --- P--- Theater, and fire engines were chasing each other up and down it! I felt as though I was still at D-------, and I was fearful that the dorm was on fire.
Interpretation
A few days before this dream I had heard several fire engines, and was tempted to find the fire. I hadn't been thinking about D----- my boyfriend, or a picnic. Perhaps my worry about the dorm burning up was caused by the fact that the dorm I lived in, is an old fire trap, and we were constantly having fire drills.

Answers to questions
2. I felt anxiety and frustration at not being able to get up the hill - also I felt excitement over the fire engines.
3. An actual participant
4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
5. A steep hill in a park.

This dream took place in an apartment which was supposedly my home, and was located on Cedar, near the top of Cc--- Hill. The building resembled an apartment, but the bottom floor was a huge mansion in which I lived. I saw two girls I knew, both named Virginia, and was talking to them through the window. I suddenly realized that I had missed a girlfriend's wedding, in which I was supposed to be a bridesmaid. The wedding took place at 9:45. I ran downstairs, and suddenly our basement was composed of many long tunnels with wooden posts, cobwebs, and insects. It resembled a mine and had many rooms off of it. I was with my freshman year roommate at college, and we were being pursued by an invisible worn! My roommate said something which angered the worm, and the next thing I knew she was being cut by a razor blade! I recall seeing scratches on her face and blood coming from there.
Interpretation
Perhaps this dream illustrates my aggressive tendencies! found myself frantically running from something, although I don't know what it would have been in real life. The house or basement was nothing which I had ever seen before. I had been looking through my Heights yearbook recently, and remember seeing the pictures of the two Virginias in my dream. Why I should dream of an invisible worm with a razor, I do not know, unless it is a phallic symbol.

In this dream my father was going to take a group of us for an airplane ride, including my sister (23), my mother (52), a girlfriend of my sister's (23), and myself. Much of my dream seemed to be composed of an argument I was having with my mother. She wouldn't allow me to go in the plane, and it seemed to have something to do with the kind of shoes I had on! She told me that if I went I would be killed. I remember feeling that I was being persecuted, and my sister was allowed to go while I wasn't.
Suddenly the scene changed and I was at college at M. University. I was walking on the fourth floor of a dormitory, and the floor was broken up into big pieces which were revolving. Someone came up to me and asked me who turned on the switch to have the floors revolve. This was connected with the airplane ride, as someone said that the reason the floor was revolving was because there was an airplane someplace near by.

Interpretation
The dream seems to indicate a feeling of my sister's preference in the family. The friend of my sister's was a girl who I have not seen or thought of for years. The dominance of my mother in the dream relates to reality, for she is always the disciplining factor in the family. The revolving floors might show a feeling of insecurity or fear of rejection.

I dreamed I was at a party, composed of a mixed crowd of adults. Each person had some sort of an animal with him, and these animals were entered in a contest. They were to burrough in the ground and the first to reach the goal was the winner. I then suddenly found myself completely alone.
Interpretation
The presence of adults might indicate my desire to be treated as an adult and be free of dependency. The contest might be my struggle for recognition, and at the same time my fear of rejection and conflict about becoming independent would be indicated by being left alone.

I had a job in some sort of plant (factory) and I worked at a machine which resembled a cream separator used on small farms. I cannot recall the operation of this machine at all. The only incident I recall is that I was angry and in this anger the only way of release that I seemed to have was to squash slices of ripe tomatoes over the parts of the machine which stuck out. This act seemed to be a retalitory act.
Interpretation
I do not have a definite interpretation of this dream. I can associate the tomatoes with the fact that I have always enjoyed eating raw tomatoes but why they would appear in an unpleasant dream is not clear to me. The presence of the machine seems to indicate the steady rigid pace of social custom, and since I had been forced to leave a party sooner than I had wanted to just recently; this dream might indicate that I found release for this frustration by being angry at the machine.

Answers to questions
2. I seemed to be angry and frustrated at the same time.
3. Actual participant
4. Unpleasant
5. 
6. No
7. Yes, red tomatoes, black machine.

Setting- our pond at home, it was late fall, the trees were all bare and it was cold outdoors.
Characters -five men who were strangers. I was not able to distinguish them as to age but they appeared to be dressed as business men.

Action - A glider plane landed on the water close to the dam. The landing seemed to be smooth but actually it was a forced landing. I recall seeing the ship sink slowly in the water but recall no action until I saw the five bodies, in miniature size, lying together in the bottom of an ordinary pail. I did not question the fact the bodies had suddenly became so small and know of no reason for it. I was alone watching this action from a distance but later when I saw the bodies' our St. Bernard dog was with me. I experienced no dread, only surprised wonder and sadness.

Interpretation
I enjoy flying a great deal and for this reason the appearance of a plane is not novel to me. I must have gotten my ships a little mixed up though, for while the action of a ship landing on our pond is not new, since it occurred last year in the late fall, the ship was a heliocopter, equipped for amphibious landings. I was not at home when this occurred and was very disappointed about it, so it would seem that even though I was unable to place myself in the dream as a passenger at least I had the satisfaction of being able to see it. However, the feeling of sadness which I experienced upon the realization that people had been drowned in our pond is directly related to by conscious feeling of fear that someone, some day, may drown in our pond, for at its deepest end it is approximately 15 feet deep. The presence of strangers is most likely a manifestation of the new groups of people I have met here at W.R.U. The presence of the pail and the dog only served to make the dream more closely related to my past experiences.

College women, late 1940s:#0419 (Code 059, Age 23, 10/11/47)

Setting - a restaurant on the campus of the college I was attending.
Characters -my father and brother, 2 student waiters, several old women and an average restaurant crowd.

Action - I had planned on meeting my father and brother (who is in the Navy now but was a civilian here) at this restaurant. I spent a good deal of time looking for them among the crowd but finally found them. Then we sat down to eat but had to wait a long time until a waiter promised to take our order. I recall that there were two student waiters who were very busy taking care of serving several older women. Sometime during the action, I recall bumping into the waiters and having to excuse myself. I recall no other action but I do remember experiencing frustration when I was unable to find my dad and brother and even greater frustration when we were unable to get the waiter to take our order.

Interpretation
I interpret this dream as a manifestation of my desire to have my brother at home again and in a more broad sense my desire but my seemingly impossible hope of making my father look with less cynicism and distrust at the general topic -college. In this dream I seemed to have failed in that endeavor again although I recall nothing of my father's reaction. The entire situation was not a favorable one for my point of view. The presence of men student waiters is most likely an unconscious association with a student who I have met here who waits on tables. The appearance of older women probably suggest a part of the faculty, although I have had no reason for feeling a dislike toward them.

I dreamt that I was to attend a Spanish class at 7:30 at night. I had to go to my room in the dormitory to get my books. I remember taking an escalator to the 2nd floor and meeting a girl on the escalator. I told her to wait for me. When I got to the 2nd floor, I opened the door to my room and discovered it was a classroom. I was very confused. I tried some of the other doors on the floor, but they were all locked. I decided to take an elevator down to the first floor, but here the dream gets rather confused. I seemed to be swinging through hoops. I remember thinking it was like some ride at E. Beach.
Interpretation
This dream took place shortly before school started, which explains its content. The reference to 7:30 is easily explained as I intended getting up the next day at that hour to attend an activities program for new students. My mayor is Spanish. I had been a little worried about how well I'd do this semester, because I'm transferring from 0. During my two years stay there I lived in a dormitory. I had been wondering how I would like living at home again after having had two extremely pleasant years of dormitory life. I cannot account for the balance of the dream.

College women, late 1940s:#0436 (Code 064, Age 21, 09/21/47)

I dreamt that my 19 year old brother and I had just left our house and were walking down our street. From a distance we saw two people (don't recall sex) on the corner. They seemed to be looking for someone to antagonize. It did not occur to me that we would be the unfortunate ones. When they saw us they began to throw sticks and stones at us. We turned back and started running down the street. We crossed the street and went through an open gate in a backyard (unfamiliar to me except that I seem to have seen this gate and yard before in my dreams.)
We ran on for what seemed close to an half hour. Then we reached a side street and stopped--assuring ourselves that we were no longer being pursued. The street seemed to be in the neighborhood of S C Ave., which is about 20 blocks from my home. I asked my brother if he wanted to take a cab home and then before he had replied, continued that I thought we would be safe on a streetcar. At that moment my parents came into view. They had both very obviously been drinking and were tottering on their feet and grinning stupidly. My mother said that she had had ten drinks. Our car was parked on the side street and we decided to go home. We got into the car and just before we left a policeman came up and gave us a ticket for parking in front of a fireplug. We drove up to 1 st. and started down when I realized all of a sudden that we were in the midst of a parade. All the paraders were colored people. They began shouting that we could not ride in their parade.

Interpretation
I believe the reason my brother entered the dream is that he has been overseas for 1 1/2 years and I have been anxiously looking forward to his return this fall. I had this dream two days after I saw the movie "G." Being of the J faith it naturally made a deep impression on me. Although I had never experienced any real difficulties because of my religious views, the picture brought out to me the many humiliating experiences which others of my faith have undergone. The whole issue of anti-semitism in the movie began with the invitation of Mr. S (a J) to his apartment of some soldier's saying: "What is the matter? D'ya think we're not good enough to drink your stinking liquor?" The number ten may have arisen from the boasting of one of my young friends on the Saturday before my dream that he had consumed 10 bottles of beer at a picnic. The amount he had consumed greatly astounded me at the time. I cannot explain the fact that both my parents were drunk, as both drink very little. The difficulty we experienced with the policeman may have been due to the parking difficulties we have had of late. With reference to the parade of colored people, their place in my dream is probably due to the fact that we live in an almost entirely colored neighborhood and have been attempting unsuccessfully to find another house into which to move.

College women, late 1940s:#0437 (Code 064, Age 21, 09/30/47)

In my dream I am in a two-room doctor's office. The doctor's sex seems to fluctuate between male and female. There are two other patients in the office. One of the patients is my cousin (a girl of 23), the other a middle-aged woman unknown to me, accompanied by her two children. The doctor examines the middle-aged woman and tells her bluntly she has cancer of the pancreas. He then examines my cousin and tells her she has cancer of the breast. My cousin burst out crying and ran into the next office. The rooms of the office are doorless. The doctor examines me and makes no comment. I go to the next room and see my cousin. She is holding a ring box and crying. A woman is combing her hair and comforting her. The middle-aged woman offers to drive the doctor (now a woman) home. The doctor asks the woman if she will also drive me home and she hesitatingly answers in the affirmative. It seems that she and I live in the same neighborhood. She drops us off at the corner of my street.
Interpretation
The doorless two-room office, I believe, may have been brought to my mind by the voting booths. I had noted for the first time that day and it left a deep impression on my mind. There has been a great deal of publicity of late with regard to Cancer Clinics, and I think the middle-aged woman in my dream symbolizes my aunt, who died of cancer two years ago. She, also, had two children. By cousin's presence may be accounted for by the fact that I am to be a bridesmaid at her wedding next month and have been very excited at the prospect. The ring box symbolizes her approaching wedding as does, I believe, the combing of her hair as if getting ready for the wedding. The voting booth was on the corner and I believe this fact corresponds to the last phase of my dream. The doctor, now, may be identified with my girlfriend--with whom I went to vote.

I am in a two-room office. It seems to be in the M. A. building. There are two women in the office. I recognize both of them as being co-workers of mine when I worked for the MMC three years ago. Another woman (just a blurred image) is dictating to one of the girls. She seems to be worried because the mail had not yet arrived. I go down to the basement of the building and look in my box. "I find two notes. The top seems to be located in M A, but is on the wrong side of the hall. The notes seem to deal with some papers which I forgot to turn in at the bookstore. I am extremely puzzled. "How could I have known about those papers when I am not a Mstudent, " I say to myself. As I am standing by the box I see my cousin (a married man of 29) put a note in his sister's box. (She is 31 and does not go to M.) I then go to the bookstore which is also in the basement. I am told it is the wrong one. I go upstairs, still in search of the bookstore and meet my S prof (the one I had at OSU.) I seem now to be at 0. S. U. He asks me why I returned and I explain that I am no longer going steady. At this point my dress blows up and I have difficulty holding it down. Ask him to help. We admit that teachers seem to get along better with pupils in class than out. I walk away.
Interpretation
The two-room office here represents my advisor's office. I had been in to see her the previous day. The women from W. M. C. were probably brought to my mind because I saw one of them downtown recently and it had been a long time since I saw anyone from the office. The note I found in my box corresponds to the one I received from my advisor. She had advised me that through error, I had been placed in a class for which juniors were not eligible. She said she had not known about it (which corresponds to my statement that I could not have known about the papers.) My cousin probably entered my dream due to the fact that I was worried about him. I had heard that day that he was having marital difficulties and that his family (represented by his sister) were very perturbed. I cannot account for the presence of my S Prof. in my dream, nor why I should again be at OSU. The episode of the dress is equally unaccounted in my mind. My statement that I am no longer going steady is true. It probably explains my return to 0. S. U.--escape from unpleasant situation here.

I am seated in a classroom. It is a course in Beginning German. Our teacher is a woman (face unfamiliar). It is the first day of class. The teacher is speaking to us in German. (I don't understand her.) All of a sudden we see a man running past the window. He is carrying books. The teacher attempts to attract his attention, but fails. He comes into the classroom a few minutes later, wearing a shirt. I seem to recall that he wore a baby's bonnet on his head. He takes these clothes off or, at any rate, I later recall him as wearing a business suit. His features are very clear (face unfamiliar to me). I particularly notice that his teeth are not nice. He and the German prof. discuss the possibility of opening up another German class. The teacher again talks to us in German. The words are very long. I do not understand her. The young man leaves and says goodbye to us all. (Forgot to mention that I laughed almost hysterically when he came into the room. I remember the tears rolled down my cheeks.) In the second part of my dream, I seem to be near a football field. I am looking for my boyfriend, but cannot find him. The scene changes to the lounge of the dormitory at O. S. U. I am sitting on a striped-chintz love seat. My housemother comes into the room (aged 60). At the same time I see a girlfriend of mine being helped into a car. Someone says she is being taken to the Dean's office. My housemother approaches and asks me for my notebooks. She says the Dean is looking through all girls' notebooks to see if they have loud sentences written in them. I give her all but my psychology notebook which I fear may have some obscene words in it. I look through it, but find nothing. I see my boyfriend (age 20) and tell him what happened. He tells me he thinks they were wrong for doing it. The third phase of my dream took place in my living room. My boyfriend and I are seated on the couch. He attempts to kiss me, but I feign indifference. He calls my bluff and we kiss.
Interpretation
The episode in the German class can probably be explained by the fact that my boyfriend is taking German and experiencing difficulty with it. I remember telling him that I wish I knew German so that I could help him. I attempted to test him on a vocabulary list and we both laughed heartily over my pronunciation. The unusual costume of the head of the German Department brings to my mind the costumes sported by freshmen women the first week of school. The second phase of my dream would seem to represent my guilt feelings concerning sex. Of late I have noticed that my mind is frequently preoccupied with the subject of "sex" I have felt that my preoccupations were unhealthy. The episode of the psychology notebook escapes me. The third phase probably represents just plain wishful thinking. I hadn't kissed my boyfriend in a few days and was looking forward to it. I probably feign indifference to get back at him for not having kissed me.

I'm in a hotel room with one of my girlfriends (age 21). I see a tall, blond woman wearing a gold evening gown. Her gown catches on fire. My girlfriend and I hasten toward an open window and jump out. The room we had been in was devoid of furniture. (Not too sure of last statement.) We quickly run around to the front entrance. We go into a large room. I see a handful of people sitting on what appear to be shoe-shine chairs. Their heads are all bent down and they appear to be very sad. I recognize my father. I seem to recall that some of the others were also members of my family, but I couldn't remember specifically who they were. Someone tells me that some of the members of my family are missing.
Interpretation
This dream has little meaning for me. The only connection I can make with the hotel room is that my boyfriend and I have a standing joke about making a reservation at the S-- hotel, "just to sleep together nothing else." The girl in my dream used to go steady with my boyfriend, but is now married. It was she who introduced us. Perhaps this dream symbolizes the family disapproval with which our indiscretion would be met. Yet, this interpretation seems hard to accept, as we have never seriously considered transgressing. I suppose I must confess to being extremely curious of "what it would be like." Maybe the dream represents a conflict between my unconscious desire to have intercourse and a strict superego.

In my dream someone tells me that my brother, age 19, is on his way home and is planning to drop in on us unexpectedly. My mother, age 47, sister, age 19, and I decide to surprise him and be at the station to meet him. When we arrive, we see my brother and his boyfriend, age 19, also enlisted in the U. S. Army. They seem to see us, but pass right by. My brother then turns around, takes out a flashbulb camera and takes our picture. I then remember my mother embracing my brother and crying. I run up to my brother, hug him and with tears welling up into my eyes keep repeating that I am so glad he has finally come home. J remember that as I was hugging him, a little voice within me kept saying: "See, you didn't have to worry about how you'd act when you saw ____._."
Interpretation
My brother had called from S--, W-- Saturday night. He talked to my mother and dad but not to me, as I was not home. I was very excited about his call, and remember saying that I was glad in a way, that I had not been home as I wouldn't have known what to say to him. His boyfriend also called his mother that night to say that he would be home soon. The flashbulb camera brings to mind the fact that my sister asked me to take her flashbulb pictures to the photography shop the next day to be developed. The fact that my brother was planning to drop in on us unexpectedly may be explained by the fact that those were the plans he actually had.

I find myself in a small kitchen. It seems to be on the second floor. My cousin, girl age 19, is with me. We decide to go for a walk. As we are walking we pass a large field. A wedding seems about to take place. I see the bride, also a cousin, age 24, dressed in a bridal gown. One of my aunts (can't remember who) came up to us and asks us why we aren't ready. We assure her that we will hasten home and get ready. On the way home we pass a fruit store. My mother and dad are just coming out the door. I angrily yell at my mother for not having reminded me to get ready. We approach the house which appears to be an apt. bldg with an unusual number of steps leading up to the door. As we are ready to ascend the steps we are accosted by 2 boys. I ignore the one who attempts to speak to me, noticing that he has little hair on the top of his head. I say to myself that he has no more hair than my boyfriend. We go up to the apartment. The next scene is in a church. I am standing in front of a mirror. I look at my bridesmaid gown and discover it is extremely large in the waist. When I look again it has changed to a house dress. I remember feeling very relieved and reassuring myself that it wasn't the gown but the housedress that was too large. I ask someone (don't remember who) if there is a washroom somewhere. I enter a doorway and see a number of men milling around. I remember saying: Heads up.
Interpretation
The apartment is entirely unfamiliar to me. My cousin age 17, is to be a bridesmaid at my other cousin's age 24 wedding. This is the second dream I've had about her wedding. I explain it as due to my excitement at being a bridesmaid for the first time. My gown was being altered and I greatly feared that it wouldn't fit upon its completion. This probably accounts for the fact that it was too large in my dream. The housedress episode seems to symbolize my refusal to believe that the dress would be too large. The episode of the washroom escapes me, although I have had another dream in which a washroom played a part and also in which men were present.

It is toward evening. I am getting into a station wagon. My sister, age 18, also gets in. There are 2 or 3 other people in the car but I do not recall their sex or identity. I seem to be riding in the back seat, yet later I am in the front seat. There is also a dog riding with us in the front seat. The locale in which we are riding is unfamiliar to me. After we have ridden awhile my sister and I express desire to use the women's washroom. We stop in front of a building which resembles somewhat H. Chapel. We alight and go in. We find the women's washroom. It is an immense room which resembles none I've seen. There are many little cubby holes which I presume to contain toilets. However I did not see any. Each cubby hole was covered in front with a white curtain. However the backs were left completely open. I looked through the back entrance of the cubby hole and saw a long bench on which a group of men were sitting. I looked and looked but could find no cubby hole whose back entrance was also covered. I woke up. It was about 3-4 in the morning. I felt an extreme urge to urinate.
Interpretation
I cannot interpret this dream. I have never ridden in a station wagon nor expressed a desire to do so. We have no dog at home. Perhaps the dog was brought to my mind by the fact that everyday on my way home I pass a pet shop. In each window there are about 1/2 dozen puppies. I always stop to look at them, assuring myself at the same time that as cute as they are, I wouldn't want to be bothered with them.

In my dream I see my recently married cousin, girl age 24, walking down my street supported by two other girls. I recognize one as being another one of my cousins. They are walking very slowly and approach our house. My mother and I are standing on the porch. We greet them. I ask my cousin how she is feeling and she responds that she feels well. I remember thinking to myself that I was so glad she was well and that now perhaps she would be able to keep her baby. All thou leave soon thereafter and they continue to walk very slowly down the street. All of a sudden she (the one who is to have a baby) appears to be suspended in air with her toes pointing toward the ground. I remember thinking: well, if she can do that she is all right.
Interpretation
At a family tea held Friday night I inquired if the cousin mentioned in my dream were going to be there. By mother informed me that my cousin was pregnant but she was laid up in bed and it was greatly feared that she would lose her baby. I seem to be reassuring myself that everything would finally resolve itself.

I am walking down a street which I recognize as being near PHJH. A man, a woman, and a baby in a carriage approach me. I can see the man and woman's features very clearly. They are both unfamiliar to me. The man lifts the buggy in the air. He seems to be trying to get it over a puddle. I stretch out my arms and help him. I look into the buggy and wrinkle up my nose at the baby. The next scene takes place in an apartment. The same 3 people are present. The young mother attempts to give the baby a bottle. The milk is too hot. She tries to give him the bottle again; it is still too hot. She finally gives it to the baby and he refuses it because it is too cold. The man throughout this procedure appears to be hostile toward his wife. In the next scene I pass a mother (same woman) and a little boy on the corner of a busy intersection (unfamiliar). The boy is now about 4-5 years old. I can see his features very clearly, yet he, too, is unfamiliar to me. I again wrinkle up my nose at him and remember that I had done the same thing when he was an infant. I turn the corner and walk down a street. I past a store and look into the store window. I see my image. I notice that I appear just as young, but am slightly heaver in weight.
Interpretation
I have been contemplating marriage with a student of the University and have spent quite a bit of thought on the fact that I would not be able to have children for perhaps 4-5 yrs. I believe this child symbolizes the child I would not be able to have. That is why I believe, when he appears to be 4-5 yrs. old, I still look the same. I would analyze the man's hostility toward his wife thus: It has often said that a wife neglects her husband upon the birth of a child and I am determined to divide my love upon the birth of my child in order that my husband should not be deprived of any previous relationship. The only location which I can explain is that of proximity to P.H.J.H. We parked nearby one evening.

My dream takes place in the basement of what appears to be my former high school (G). I remember that it is quite dark in the basement and I was alone. I approached a stairway leading from the basement outside and see the outline of a tall, heavily built man, his back to me, bolting the door. I cannot remember seeing his face. Be turned around and I screamed for help. There was a leather couch down in the basement, exactly like the one found in the MA lounge. I can't remember details, but I got the impression that he attacked me. The next thing I remember is being outside, crying, and seeing my boyfriend. I rush toward him and bury my head in his shoulder. A policeman appears on the scene and at the same time my attacker. My boyfriend points the man out to the policeman, who takes him away.

Two possibilities occur to me in interpretation of this dream. Perhaps the dream actually represents a fear of being attacked. We live in a practically totally negro-populated neighborhood. I have felt a bit scared upon walking down the street at night, but somehow I don't think it would manant a dream of this type. Stretching the imagination a bit, I can see that it might indirectly point to a desire for sexual intercourse. However in that case there seems to be an element of fear involved and as far as I know I am not afraid of having intercourse.

I am sitting at a long table similar to those found in T living. The room appears to be one found in SBL. I am working on my English Source theme. There are a few people at the table, but I'm not sure of their identity or sex. One of them has some cards which contain information for a source theme. I look them over, thinking that perhaps I can use the information, when someone tells me that it concerns E. (My theme deals with the A C) I see a woman and her little girl approaching. I remember thinking there was something very odd about the little girl. Her face was very different looking as were her clothes. I saw her features and those of her mother very clearly, yet they were totally unfamiliar to me. Her mother addresses her as The Princess. The little girl goes to put out a book, but a man enters the scene. I think he prevented her from taking the book. I remember that the little girl kept smiling. She appeared to be about seven or eight years old. The dream gets confused here. There seems to be a conspiracy to see that no one leaves the library alive. But, without speaking, there seems to be an agreement between the librarian and me to see that I leave unharmed.
Interpretation
I can well understand my dreaming about the source theme. It is due Wednesday and I haven't started it as yet. (writing it, that is.) The cards probably represent the fact that I feel I don't have enough information to write a source theme with. I put off the writing for today and have had no little anxiety concerning it. The episode of the woman and little girl doesn't bring anything to mind. Although the fact that she referred to her as the princess probably refers to the much publicised Princess Elizabeth's wedding. The episode of impending death would seem to indicate a fear of death on my part, but an uneacelingness to believe that it could actually happen to me. I confess to having given the matter a great deal of thought at various times in my life, but none recently. I know that I do not fear death, my only fear is that I may die young, before having experienced a happy married life and the joy of having children.

This dream I am not a participant at any time. The dream first takes place in a train terminal. I see a boy and girl embracing. Some voice says that they both have one interest in common: oil. I then see two pipes which seem to be going up and down. The next thing I remember is their being married and settled in an apartment. There seems to be a story teller in my dream. He says that this marriage is a triangle including the man, his wife, and his mother-in-law. The mother-in-law continually called her daughter to remind her of appointments, etc. In the next scene the girl is making supper. She opens the icebox and I saw a gallon jar in the icebox. It contained huge pink and red roses in a fluid. On the bottom of the jar there is a label which gives a company name and says they preserve wedding flowers. The girl then looks into the stove. I see what appear to be different types of leftovers (meat pie, etc.) being reheated. The girl wonders if there will be enough and says she will just eat a little.
Interpretation
I do not understand the "oil" element of this dream. This dream seems to be another of a series of dreams concerning marriage, which I am contemplating. I can well understand the occurrence of mother-in-law in the dream as I am a bit frightened at the prospect of acquiring one. I did not get off to such a good start with my boyfriend's mother and am afraid I may run into a little difficulty with her. The preserved flowers represent my proposed marriage, I suppose. The food episode seems to represent my anxiety that we will not be able to live on $90 a month.

I am in a department store (resembling H--). I seem to be on a floor other than the first. Preparations are being made for a style show, in which I am to participate. I seem to be wearing a wool dress of checked material. I get on an elevator going down, but when we get to the basement I notice the belt of my dress is missing. We return to the same floor and then find that the belt is in the elevator. I put it on, and at first it doesn't seem to match the dress, but then later it does. We return to the basement. The style show is already in progress. The audience seated in rows or benches, seems to be composed of all young people. A girl whom I know is master of ceremonies. She brings out a dog and a duck and says they allow no petting there. Then I wondered if perhaps I hadn't heard wrong, maybe she said "We allow no pets here." One of the models has already gone on the stage. I wonder where the other models are and where we are to go. Another girl is with me, I don't know who she is. We go into a little building. One wall is off allowing us to see into it. I see girls lying in bed in P. J.'s studying. I then see a girl (who is in my S-- class). She is fully clothed. I ask her if she knows where the models are. She goes to the window and points to a small building. I ask her how I can get there. I think perhaps I can climb out the window, but when I look down I notice that it's quite a jump. I ask her if there is a back door and she says "yes" We go out the back door and see a group of girls standing in a row. I am particularly impressed with the variety of bright colors which they are wearing. I recognize one of the girls as my former roommate. She is dressed in bright yellow. She waves to me and shouts that she is getting her grades the next day.
Interpretation
The theme of my dream would seem to indicate a desire for clothes. My wardrobe has been quite depleted and I have been contemplating replenishing it. I have been pretty anxious about my lack of clothes as I do not feel as self-confident when I am not well dressed. My boyfriend, also, has been insisting that I buy myself something to wear. The appearance of the duck and dog, I guess was a convenient way to introduce the theme of petting into my dream. I am contemplating getting engaged and we have discussed the possibility of petting as a preparation for the intimacies of marriage. However, both of us decided we would have severe feelings of guilt if we did pet. I cannot account for the balance of my dream except to state that the girl who is in my S-- class has always reminded me of a model.

I remember walking out of a house and continuing my walk down a main thoroughfare. A man (short, middle-aged, shabby) unfamiliar to me is following me. He has something wrapped in newspaper which he wants to sell me. He says something to me and I remember the word "cotton." I tell him "no" and cross the street. He follows me. Then somehow he gets ahead of me. I throw a glass at him, but miss. I see a group of people gather around a woman who is stretched on the ground. A young woman is crying: She says her mother's hand has been cut off. I draw close and see a huge scar across the hand of the woman. There is no blood. I keep repeating "I did it, I did it." I was awakened abruptly by my father at this part--it was 7:10 in the morning.
Interpretation
I cannot determine what the man stands for in my dream. The woman I feel, although I hate to admit, would seem to be my boyfriend's mother. She didn't look like her, but the scar on her hand resembled the one my boyfriend has on his wrist. This dream corroborates my other dream analysis in which I stated that I was afraid that my relationship with my future mother-in-law may not be a very happy one.

I seemed to be in a drawing class sitting around a long table. The class was instructed to draw a duck. Another girl was sitting at my table but I can't remember who she was. We were asked to come to the front of the room to hear a story. All of the girls sit down on small chairs. I sit down and then change my seat. Our teacher is a young woman (in her twenties, unfamiliar to me). Everyone had a white sheet in front of them with a pencil. I had no pencil, but tell myself that I will be able to remember. One of the girls reads a story about ducks. All of the girls laugh. We then go back to our seats. It's getting dark. Another class comes up from the basement ready to go home. This class consists of all small children, mostly dressed in snowsuits. I get angry because we have not been told to go home. Then teacher says we can go home and wishes us a happy Easter. Someone turns the lights off and I cannot find my crayons. I look in my box (resembling my evening bag) and see only two crayons. I look on the table and see a bunch of little stubs of crayons and some large ones, but can't determine their color in the dark. Someone (a man) tries to find the light but cannot. I become very angry. A girl (about 21, in my E-- class) comes up to me and shows me her hand, palm up. I see a ring. I turn my hand up and she says "Oh, you've got one, too!" I ask her if she just got hers. She says "no." Her ring is smaller than mine and she says she couldn't wear my size. I tell her that my hand is proportionately larger.
Interpretation
This dream seems to tie in with the Christmas dinner we had at my fiance's home. The duck would seem to represent the goose we ate. After dinner my fiance and I had a discussion about how differently our respective homes were run- the fact that his mother was much more economical in buying and using her food and in furnishing her home. I guess the discussion raised a doubt in my mind as to whether or not he and I would see eye to eye on the expenditure of money. The episode of the ring is pretty obvious to me. I became engaged ~ few weeks ago and as is pretty common with girls, I wondered what others would think of my ring. I was also a little doubtful as to whether I liked it or not. The drawing and crayons I find difficult to fit in as I have no interest in them and can't imagine what they could symbolize. Easter probably represents Christmas. The only thing I am reminded of with regard to the lights is that before my fiance and I had our discussion, we had to turn on the light in the kitchen.

This dream was quite a bit longer, but all I can remember is that the stone seemed to have come loose from my diamond engagement ring. At first I thought I had lost it, but someone helped me find it (I think it was my fiance, age 23)
Interpretation
My fiance and I had a long talk New Year's morning. I hadn't spent a very happy renew Year's Eve and we were attempting to get to the bottom of it. The dream seems to symbolize his attempt to help me out of my difficulty. I had not been very proud of him that night and we both wondered if it would occur again. He told me that if it occurred with too great frequency we would probably not be very happy together and in such an event we would have to terminate our engagement. I told him I'd try hard not to let little things bother me because I think we can have a successful marriage. Finding the stone seems to indicate a happy ending, and in truth the evening ended on a happy note.

I seemed to be attending a party in my home. I recognized two of the people as being my cousin (a girl, age 30) and her husband. There were many people present. I was holding a baby which seemed to be my cousin's. He talked quite fluently for his age and I was much impressed by his intelligence. The scene shifts to my aunt's home (age 40). She seems to be showing me around her house. We come to one room that is empty and looks as if it had not been used in years. She then shows me a bedroom and I particularly notice the gay bedspread and matching drapes. We come to another room and I notice that it contains a double bed and two twin beds. I seem to owe her some money and she brings out a white slip with pencilled items on it and starts to figure.
Interpretation
The party probably represents the engagement party my mother plans to give in my honor quite soon. My cousin probably enters the dream as we were discussing the fact that she recently had a miscarriage. The scene in my aunt's home probably occurred because of the lengthy conversations I have had with my fiance, my parents and friends about the difficulty of finding an apartment and my wondering about how I would furnish it. The empty room can probably be explained by the fact that if we get a house or a large apartment we will probably close off one room as we cannot afford to furnish an entire house. The issue of twin and double beds arose in our discussion (my fiancees and mine) and we found that a double bed had the greater asset balance. The slip and its figures represents my aunt's charge acct. at a wholesale house for linens which she suggested to us was at our disposal when I buy linens.

I walked over to T Library to look up a book in the catalogue. I went around to the entrance on the West Side of the building but the door was locked and there was a sign on the door giving directions to go around to the front entrance on E Avenue. I knew there wasn't any entrance on E but I went anyway. When I got there I found a beautiful building of Georgian architecture - long and low with about 10 pillars. It was beautifully landscaped with grass, evergreens and tall trees. I just stood and looked at it.

My mother - age 43 - and I were sitting in a theater waiting for the performance to start (I don't know what kind of show it was, it might have been a movie, a play or an opera) and we were the only ones sitting in the section of seats about half-way back close to the side. Then about 20 famous movie stars came in and sat all around us. They kept making all kinds of noises, laughing, singing, and talking and I couldn't keep my mind on the performance. So I told my mother I was leaving and I would be back in a few minutes. I don't know where I went or what I did but when I came back the movie stars were gone and my mother was sitting among ordinary people who were quietly enjoying the performance.

They said they didn't need to wear gloves or use an anesthetic because the tree wasn't really an alive human being. Then they took out a saw and one of them began to saw off slices of the tree supposedly, but it was a human foot. They sliced off pieces just like meat (only it looked like cork).

When we went out to get into the car, however, it wouldn't start and he had to fix it. In the meantime, my cousin and I went over to our mail box to get the mail for my mother. There was a letter in the mail from my sister. She sent us a copy of a newspaper in which appeared a picture of her with my little niece who is five.

College women, late 1940s:#0481 (Code 070, Age 20, 09/27/47)I dreamed I was at my own wedding (I am not married). I was conscious of the fact that although my mother (age 44), my father (age 47), and my sister (age 22) were quite nervous, I had an overwhelming feeling of contentment and happiness. As we walked down the aisle, which was down the center of an extremely large ballroom, the small orchestra was playing "A1ways." My groom (his face was not clear to me, and it was no one I know) was already at the altar and he was watching me intently. It took a long time for my parents and me to walk down the aisle; but all the while I returned my groom's gaze although I was aware that my parents were nodding to people in the audience and smiling at them. Suddenly, with my eyes still on my husband to be, I started to sing along with the orchestra. My mother was very startled and appeared to be a little embarrassed at my unconventiality, but my father quietly said to her, "This is all hers." My dream ends while I was still walking down the aisle and singing, and the whole audience, and my parents, were smiling and some of them were crying because of the great love my fiance and I had for each other.

In reality, I remember at by cousin's wedding she had the orchestra play this same song instead of the bridal march and it impresses me a great deal. My groom's and my staring at each other, I might interpret, as a strong desire to fall in love and be very much loved in return.Interpretation

I, myself, was carrying a miniature piano and I was practicing several tunes I had composed myself. While I was playing, I could hear the others laughing and joking; and I was so afraid that I could not meet their standards, that I started to cry. I wondered why they did not need any practice and why I required so much. In the midst of my playing and with tears streaming down my face, I realized that suddenly a hush had come over the room. I kept on playing with an intense vigor and soon, the rest of the musicians had taken up their instruments and were accompanying me. When I finished, they all applauded me and I soon joined the group with a great feeling of satisfaction and happiness.

College women, late 1940s:#0483 (Code 070, Age 20, 10/08/47)The lady across the hall from our apartment was acting very suspicious, it seemed to me. Heretofore, she had scarcely even been around the apartment. Lately, I had noticed she was bringing much food to the house, and that a number of packages were being delivered to the apartment, too. I decided then to do a little sleuthing. I took a ladder and placed it against the bedroom window. I carefully climbed up and just as I thought, there was a man sleeping in the bed. His face looked familiar to me but I couldn't remember from where. That night, I was reading the newspapers; and there across the front page was a picture of the man I had seen with a bold caption of "Wanted" above it. Of course, I immediately called the police, the criminal was apprehended, and I was a glorified heroine.

She told me that she was very afraid of getting on and off streetcars because she had once fallen off a streetcar. I told her not to worry because I would gladly help her. When the streetcar came, I helped her on and then took her to a seat. She asked me to sit next to her, so I did. All the way to my destination, she told me about how she had always wanted a granddaughter but that she only had grandsons. She said she wanted to repay me in some way; and although, I was insistent that there was no need for it, she finally obtained my name and address.

I made some remark about pitying him; and he became so enraged, he started to chase me. He kept chasing me around the block; but despite the many people on the streets (many were C-- whom I knew) and despite the fact that he was blind, he relentlessly pursued me. He finally caught me and I tearfully told him that I had meant no harm. He started to laugh and said he was just trying to demonstrate that pity was wasted on him. Besides, he told me, he liked the sound of my voice. We then proceeded to tell all about ourselves to each other and I found out that he was a famous athlete.

Then I found myself in a car at the top of a hill with a middle-aged woman (I have no idea who she was). The woman was trying to park the car in front of her garage, but since the brakes did not work on the first two attempts, we rolled back down the hill both times--I was very frightened. The third time, however, the brakes held and we got out of the car. Then somehow or other I found myself in an amusement park with about four boys and girls my own age (I cannot identify them either). We seemed to be just standing around eating popcorn.

Driving across the border seems to signify a desire for independence, with temporary delay caused by the gas station attendant who probably represented authority.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0516 (Code 071, Age 20, 09/25/47)I was walking down a street when I met the 2 girls who really do live across the street from me. They are 14 and 16. They had brand new children's tricycles and were very happily riding them about. As soon as they saw me, they started to show off by standing up while riding. They were too big for the bicycles and when they stood up while riding, I kept warning them it was unsafe and they should be more careful and sit down. The 16 yr. old smiled very sweetly (which made me quite angry) and listened quietly and patiently till I stopped talking, then she and her sister went on riding as before, standing up. Then the 16 yr. old rode sitting down and I rode along on the back of her bike. We came to a place in which the sidewalk was uneven. There seemed to be a difference of only a couple of inches in the height of the 2 slabs of concrete, but when I looked down, it seemed like a canyon. I was frightened.

She took it with the others and had her mother return it to me the next day which made me angry. Often I've thought she and her sister are really little girls trying to act more adult.Interpretation

I tried to run in the direction of the man's voice (I did not recognize the voice.) Just as I seemed to be getting closer to the voice, it stopped and came from another direction. I started to run again; each time I thought I was near the source of the voice, it came from another direction. Then I was running about wildly. My clothes and hair were being blown about by the wind. I was sweating profusely and wiped my face on my forearm as I ran. Soon, I became frightened and exhausted.

I had been helping with the electric shock treatments for the first time. My duty was to hold the patients down during their convulsions immediately after the shock was administered. The doctors and nurses I worked with were in the dream. The patients' faces were not too clear. The dream was very real in that it seemed I could actually feel the waves of muscular contractions of the patients as I leaned on them. The preparations were very clear. I saw the nurse applying the electrode jelly, put on the rubber head-band and insert the mouth gag. I remember feeling very upset and I also felt sympathetic towards the patients.

I looked at him and saw, to my horror, that there were little blue and yellow streaks (like lightning) coming out of the scalp at the place where each electrode was attached. The patient writhed around and his face began to turn red. I became very excited and did not know what to do.

There were many small shops on the street selling millinery and ladies' clothing. All the stores were closed. (This did not seem unnatural; it must have been Sunday.) As I looked in one store, I saw a woman putting hats into a drawer. As we passed, she looked up and I was surprised to recognize her. (We had lived on the same street for 10 years.) I have not seen her for 2 years. She beckoned to us to stop. Then she opened the door and let us in. We talked and she told me she was selling Bissell carpet sweepers and could get us a good discount. Mother said to me confidentially that maybe she ought to buy a Bissell at a discount instead of the electric sweeper she had been wanting.

Instead, I walked near the rear of the store and waited for someone, the manager or a salesman to notice me. There were 4 seats, similar to the ones for giving shoe shines--There were 2 facing each way (in other words, they were back to back). There were 2 boys sitting in the 2 raised chairs facing me. I did not know the boy farthest from me. The closer one (approximate age 25), I recognized as a boy with whom I'd double dated several times. Then as I was about to say hello to him he stood up and his face changed. I recognized him as another fellow I know (approximate age 20) who had been badly burned in a fire about 5 weeks ago. I knew his face had been burned. When I remembered this fact, I noticed that his face changed. The hairline changed too and I noticed that near the face, the hair was thin and short. I thought that this was because it probably had been burned away and was just starting to grow back. I called his name and he smiled at me.

College women, late 1940s:#0526 (Code 071, Age 20, 11/31/47)I dreamed I was at sorority meeting at S's house. All the girls were seated around the living room and they began to discuss our barn dance. I remained silent, but was inwardly seething. Finally, I could contain myself no longer. I rose and made a fervent speech. I was very excited and practically shouted. In my speech, I told the girls I was resigning from the sorority. Then, as I spoke I calmed down a bit and reminded the girls that in the initiation, the president told us that one of the key pearls in our pin stood for cooperation. I reminded them how very uncooperative and inconsiderate they had been about the barn dance. The two girls who had been particularly nasty began to weep--begged me not to resign. Then all the girls chimed in and I began to sway my opinion. When the dream ended though, I was still undecided.

The night before my dream, my sorority was supposed to hold a barn dance, but the weather was bad, roads dangerous. We met at S's house. Then began a discussion that finally led to an argument as to whether we should stay in town and have a party (which could have easily been arranged) or travel 30 miles to camp in dangerous weather to have the dance. As a result all except 3 couples went to camp. I was one of those who stayed in town. We were all quite aggravated and upset because of the way things turned out. I didn't argue, but the juvenile exhibition of temper tantrums put on by some of the others made me feel ashamed in front of my date.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0529 (Code 071, Age 20, 12/16/47)I dreamed I was working in a hospital for the mentally ill. The dream was not definite on this point, but I believe I was working there and the doctors asked me to pretend that I was a patient to get some information about one of the women patients. I did this. We were in a ward. A large room with pillars in it and it had a marble floor. I was in a regular hospital bed next to the bed of the woman I was to observe. Her bed was similar to mine, except that hers had a cage-like affair over it so she couldn't get out. There was a trap door on it and it was of wooden posts with copper screening over all. We were talking and I was frightened at being a patient in such a place and petrified of this woman. She was pale and had large, boring eyes and stringy brown hair. She spoke to me and confided in me and I sympathized with her. I pretended I was a mental case, too, and told her I wished I were dead. Then, I saw her strong, powerful arms reach up and open the trap door on the cage over her bed. She said she'd take care of my body after I was dead. I knew she was going to strangle me. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My fear was overpowering. Then, I saw a nurse coming towards me (this nurse I recognized as the receptionist nurse I work with). The woman's (patient's) hands closed the trap door and she got back into her bed. Then, I fell back on my bed, my heart was pounding and I was weak. I wanted to cry. This nurse (who didn't wear a cap) and another nurse (unknown to me) wheeled my bed out and into another room. They said I had a one o'clock patient that I had to give an electroencephalogram test--then after I gave the test, I was to go back to the ward and keep pretending I was a patient. I was terrified. I said if that woman patient should see me in uniform and recognize me as a worker not a patient she'd kill me (I knew she'd strangle me) I became almost hysterical. What would I do? Then the dream ended as the 2 nurses wheeled my bed back to the ward. I was to stay there till one o'clock--time to do the test, etc. When I was back in the ward, I was weak and frightened. I lay there, opened my eyes and saw the woman staring at me, her eyes boring into me, suspicion written on her face and I lost all hope. I knew she'd kill me. 

(574 words)

Can't interpret. The receptionist is a good friend to me. In the dream, she saved me from death. This may show how much I think of her and of her loyalty to me. I thought the doctor's place very unwise--for me to do the EEG test and then go back to the ward--it placed me in such danger. This may show that often I do not approve of all the things the doctors tell me to do and think their plans sometimes aren't too wise.Interpretation

We were driving to a party in a suburb of C--. It was snowing outside. Finally, after we got to the house, I went in and took off my coat. The house was crowded and was thick with smoke. I sat down on a maroon sofa. No one else was sitting on it. Then the hostess walked over and handed me a glass. It looked like ginger ale but I suspected there was liquor in it and did not taste the drink. Someone else came over and introduced Dr. --- to me. (This is a person I had been dating, but hadn't seen in 2 months; was quite depressed.) I looked up. It was the same person, yet he didn't look the same. He wasn't as handsome. He sat down on a chair next to the sofa and was toying with his drink. His sleeves were up a little and I could see he had hairy arms. We conversed. But he had a know-it-all attitude, was curt and abrupt and almost rude. A smile was on his lips all the time. Then everyone seemed to dissolve and there was just the 2 of us. He put down his drink, sat down next to me on the sofa. I knew he was going to kiss me. Then he put his arms around me. I was expectant. When he did kiss me I pushed him away.

The salesgirls were all very enthused about a book that had arrived that day with ideas on what to do with lace and fringe. One of the girls or I should say a middle aged, tall, emaciated woman had on a black kimono and was trying a pink net shawl over this in different ways. I told her to sew it instead of pinning it. I then proceeded to buy my gifts. I tried to get some balloons but was unable to get the color that I wanted.

A little boy was knocking on the door, suddenly he turned and threw a snowball at another little boy standing next to me, the snowball hitting him on the head. The next thing I knew I was on the second floor of this house. Seated around the room were some Austrians in their native costumes, drinking beer. On one side of the room were three or four very close friends of mine. Some very competent people were setting up apparatus for a radio program. I noticed a plump, blond girl specially. After this I found myself setting up laboratory equipment. 

A tall boy with glasses was working my experiment for me. We were working with a poisonous solution which constantly foamed and boiled over. Suddenly this boy dropped whatever he was holding, gave a yell, went into convulsions, and fell to the floor hitting his head on a board. I went back to my experiment and noticed the boy get up, take a blanket and went upstairs with the appearance of having known exactly what had happened.

College women, late 1940s:#0537 (Code 071, Age 20, 02/27/47)It was a beautiful summer morning. I was working for a nursery school, and it was up to me to pick up one certain child and walk with her to school. The child was about two years old and had dark curly hair. As we walked along we stopped into each house along the way to receive what might be called little hand-outs. The child was getting tired and I began skipping houses. By the time we got to the school I was carrying the child in a knapsack hanging on my left shoulder. The next thing I remember I was on my own street. There was a garden party on our front lawn and all the neighbors were gathered. I was told to go down the street to deliver something to a house which was five houses from a house I knew well, but I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find it.

College women, late 1940s:#0538 (Code 074, Age 20, 03/06/47)It was a winter's day and I was driving along in a car full of people my own age, male and female. We came to a house which was only half completed. It belonged to a newly married couple. The wife had just finished setting the table for company. There were no doors or windows in the house, merely places where they should have been. The house looked like it had been struck by fire. In fact there was a woman around the age of thirty-two who was standing in the corner and ironed. She said that there had been a fire that day, but that she had to finish ironing the little girl's dress. We all left the house when the guests began to arrive. 

The next scene was in a garage where I was with a boy my own age who was trying to get the car in a tight parking place.

Five friends of the husband came in and offered to help. They were to paint the living room which had cheap-looking furniture in it and a parlor which was furnished in a very old fashioned way. The friends started to paint over the varnish with gray paint until I told them that they would have to scrape the varnish. They grumbled at this but finally went ahead to do it.

College women, late 1940s:#0542 (Code 074, Age 20, 03/22/47)I was in New York sitting in on a radio broadcast with my aunt and cousin. The program was "The Life of Riley." The first part was very noisy and hilarious with people moving up and down the aisles. The last part was very solemn and serious. My seventeen year old cousin wanted to see the program over again so my aunt and he stayed. I went into the lobby of the hotel and bumped into a girl friend. I told her that we were to go out to dinner in an hour and if she wanted to we could go somewhere and talk. I ran through the long carpeted lobby up two stairs and tried to get into the studio to tell my aunt where I would be. The usher let me in but my girl friend kept following me asking me where I was going. I then woke up.

College women, late 1940s:#0546 (Code 074, Age 20, 04/15/47)It was a cold winter night and I was standing out in the snow in front of a large, beautiful hotel. As I was standing there, a sleigh pulled by a very spirited horse came to a stop in front of the hotel. The King of Denmark jumped out and announced that his children would follow later with a slower horse. 

The next thing I knew I was in the lobby of the hotel which was very beautifully decorated in a modernistic tone. In a long room sitting around a long table were a group of people who were voting. Each had a ballot placed in front of him and I found myself sitting at the table. The ballots were being collected and when it was my turn I suddenly realized that I couldn't vote since I was under-age.

I went upstairs and the picture of the office is so familiar and clear in my mind that should I ever actually see it I would recognize it. Yet I am sure that I have never been in a place of that description. Winston Churchill was sitting at a desk smoking a cigar. I seemed to be applying for a job as his secretary.

College women, late 1940s:#0551 (Code 074, Age 20, 09/26/47)I was going to a fairgrounds when my two girl friends and I were notified that there was going to be a big show in the auditorium in a few minutes. We rushed to the auditorium and there we saw some old friends. I remember one very distinctly. He was a boy who went to high school with us. Now he goes to Harvard. In a Bostonian accent, I told this to my friends. They all smiled knowingly. I noticed that the Harvard boy was wearing a white tie and tails. He was a member of the local band. The show began and the announcer said that this was a special show with many acts. The first act was that three girls from the audience should come to the stage and each sit next to some boy and they would be married. It turned out that we were the three girls. I was the first one to walk down the aisle. I sat down next to a boy named Douglas and we were married. After the marriage, I left him and wondered if it were true. I then woke up. 

(323 words)

I remember the two girls whom I was with mainly, I suppose, because I have been going around with them the most of any other girls here at school. I remember passing the boy's house and thinking that now he goes to Harvard and how far all of us have gone since high school. As far as the marriage was concerned, I had been to a wedding a few days before the dream. The dream might mean that I'm interested in marriage. This is only logical.

College women, late 1940s:#0552 (Code 074, Age 20, 09/27/47)I was walking in a park one day when I realized I was trying to get to a house on the very top of a hill. I remember this walk very distinctly for it was very rugged. I remember where there used to be steps, these were now just a rolling mass of mud with a steel ridge on either side. You could either walk on the ridge or slide up the mud. There were other obstacles, too, such as high walls and waterfalls. It was a very long walk which seemed to take hours, but I at last reached the top. When I got there, I was shoved into a room with many others. There was a man there discussing posture. He looked at me and seemed very happy. He picked on me immediately, saying I was bowlegged. I listened and listened to him. At the end of his long speech, a very fat woman tried to help me by saying, "You must be very still while in bed." Then I said that I knew I was bowlegged and that my mother tried using braces on my legs but nothing helped them. However, I was taking a Body Mechanics course at Reserve and they had promised that that would help me. Everybody looked relieved and I woke up. 

(335 words)

This dream was very interesting in that so many things were true. I am a little bowlegged and have tried many different ways to overcome it. Although my mother never put braces on my legs, she has told me that they are doing it now with young children.

College women, late 1940s:#0553 (Code 074, Age 20, 10/09/47)I dreamed that I was running for a bus that was situated at the Public Square, five miles from my home. My mother was waiting for me at the stop and I was yelling for her to wait there. I was running and running for countless hours. Finally I reached the bus stop, and the bus was there waiting for me. My mother, however, was no longer there. She had vanished all of a sudden. I ran to the back of the bus and looked in. She was in the bus, so I ran to the front and got in. When I got in, my mother was standing outside waiting for me, and I saw a person running to get the bus, yelling at my mother. The peculiar part of this was that I was the person who was running. I then woke up.

I feel that the continual running had something to do with the fact that I am trying to get ads for the Reserve Tribune.

College women, late 1940s:#0554 (Code 074, Age 20, 10/11/47)This is the usual telephone dream: 

The telephone was ringing and ringing. At last, I stumbled out of bed and walked and walked. It seemed as if I walked for endless hours. It seemed as if I was walking on a moving platform, getting nowhere. At least I reached the phone, and it wasn't ringing any more. When I actually woke up from this ringing sensation, the phone was silent.

College women, late 1940s:#0555 (Code 074, Age 20, 10/11/47)I was trying to buy some records in a record shop, and I wanted to get the flat, black disks like everyone elses, but the man was trying to talk me into getting a disk that was in the shape of the wax that a dentist puts in your mouth when he wants to take an impression. This record was blue on one side and pink on the other side. I remember that the record fit into the victrola just as an impression fits into a person's mouth. I felt very nauseated. I insisted, however, upon the black, flat records, and finally bought them and walked out of the store.

As far as records are concerned, we just got a new victrola and have purchased some new records. Last week, the dentist took impressions of my lower and upper teeth.

College women, late 1940s:#0556 (Code 074, Age 20, 10/16/47)When we would come home from school, on the way we would play with frisky little monkeys. They would try to be very ferocious, but we could control them. One day, one of the girls was playing with an extra ferocious monkey. He got mad, grabbed the girl, and rushed down the street. Some man grabbed the monkey's tail, and also was carried down the street. He was trying to protect the terrified girl. We all thought it was a big joke until we saw that the man had caught his tie in a washing machine, and couldn't get loose. The girl in the meantime was having a bad way with the monkey. I rushed to the washing machine and tried to find the handle to turn it off, but this was difficult because of the great deal of newspaper that were covering the machine. The man looked very sick, but he found the handle and turned it off. At this point, my alarm went off.

College women, late 1940s:#0557 (Code 074, Age 20, 10/20/47)A person who didn't seem to be me because the person was a man was combing his hair. It seemed as if a lot of dandruff was falling on his shoulders. This person combed and combed and still more dandruff fell. Another man suggested that he use a special comb devised to get rid of dandruff. The comb was hollow, and when dipped in some oil, it would retain the oil for several days, and a person's hair would never get dry if he used this comb. Dryness was the cause of dandruff. So this man, who seemed to be me and yet was not me, bought the comb and asked for a haircut. The barber said, however, that they didn't cut hair there. We ran out of the shop. I now seem to be myself and the man is someone else.

We didn't have any tickets so we were going to buy them when we got to the box office. There were two shows that night, the six o'clock show and the 8:30 show. My aunt and I wanted to go to the 6:oo show and my brother wanted to attend the 8:30 show. We argued for quite a while and then decided to each go our own way. My aunt and I then went to the ticket office to get the tickets, but there weren't any left for the six o'clock so we decided to wait for cancellations. The manager told us we were tenth in line waiting for cancellations. We waited and waited. At last, we decided it was futile, and we asked for tickets for the 8:30 show. However, there were none left for that show either. I felt very angry with my brother. I felt it was all his fault. I was brooding when my alarm went off.

I was very surprised to see them, and very embarrassed that they should see my messy room. I, however, was very happy to see them and told them to unpack their clothes immediately, and I would help them. I hung all their clothes in the attic, which seemed a long distance from the main part of the house. They, however, were thrilled with the attic. We all got dressed up that evening, for I was going to have a party that night. My father then came in and I introduced him to the girls. Then six sailors in their white uniforms rushed in and made a dash for the piano. They wore overseas caps. About a half hour later, six more sailors with different kinds of caps rushed in and started singing around the piano. The girls were having a marvelous time.

College women, late 1940s:#0564 (Code 074, Age 20, 12/03/47)I was walking up my street when I heard the wild barking of our dog. I shouted for him. I was very glad to see him bounding toward me with all his old vim and vigor. I said to myself that I knew he wasn't dead all the time. We played in the front yard. He barked just as loud as ever and looked black and shiny as before. I could hardly believe he was alive. 

(206 words)

Our dog died Friday morning, November 28th and we all felt pretty bad about it. We had him since he was three weeks old and he died at the age of l4 years. Although he was old, he died more of pneumonia than anything else, I think. He had a bad cough that sounded as if he was choking. We asked the veterinarian about it and he told us to give the dog cough medicine. We did this, but I still have a guilty conscience that I didn't do enough to make him well. This must have been preying on my mind.Interpretation

The lady in charge told me that my mother would have to take that treatment one hour every day for one year, or else she would never get well. The lady said that I would have to be with my mother during that hour, and, consequently, could not go to school the rest of that year. I felt pretty bad about that, but was willing to do anything for my mother.

When we went on the sidewaIk, he went on the street and when he went on the sidewalk, we were on the street. We couldn't steer him toward our house. At last we got him to the front door. It was very late at night and we found the front door wide open. Mom was the first one in. She yelled for us to come in also. As we ran around inside the house to see if anyone was there, we found that every door was closed to every room, but nothing in any room was disturbed.

Since I have had a few dreams about our dog C--, who died of pneumonia last month, I feel that it is a sort of guilt feeling about his death. C-- was pretty sick before he died and although we did give him medicine and tried to heIp him, I think we could have done more for him. I foolishly washed him about a week before he died.

College women, late 1940s:#0568 (Code 074, Age 20, 01/04/48)I was living in a big mansion and had just awakened from an afternoon nap. I decided to go swimming in the lake which was near the house. I tried to get someone to go with me. It took a long time to persuade anyone, but at last I convinced them to go with me. However, we decided to go ice-skating instead. I was walking to the pond when I met an old friend, whom I hadn't seen for a few weeks. He was going skating also, but had his boxing gloves instead of ice skates. He tried to excuse himself for not calling me up by saying that he had to go to the doctor for a few days because of a sore hand. When we all reached the pond, we sat in a long row and were asked why the delay. I told the lady in charge that I had forgotten my skates. She thought I was very foolish and everyone was disgusted with me.

This was a very peculiar dream. The only incident which seemed plausible was the fact that I was wondering why the boy in the dream didn't call me up.

It was turning a bright shade of red as I combed it. I always set a deep wave in the front. This time, I did the same, but when I combed it out, the wave wasn't there. I was very sad about this. I tried to comb the wave back in, but the more I combed, the straighter my hair became on top. I was very disgusted and worried.

I was helping her sharpen the needles, as I was worried that the woman was working overtime. I seem to remember that the time was 4:35 and her quitting time is 4:00. All through this dream, I had the feeling that time was running out, and that I had to hurry. My parents were around somewhere, too, but I don't remember anything else about them in connection with the dream.

We are studying drama connected with the Roman Catholic church service and had a great deal of materlal to cover for Frlday, the day after my dream.

He carried a package which he wanted to mail at our sub-station. He opened the package and showed me two letters which were enclosed. One letter had a three cent stamp on it, the other was unstamped. He asked me for a penny stamp. I told him this was unnecessary. He insisted however, so I went to the stamp drawer and brought him a penny stamp.

College women, late 1940s:#0572 (Code 078, Age 21, 09/27/47)I was walking past John Hay High School when a teacher, about 60, whose class I had observed the day before, walked out of the building. She carried a pair of scissors and started to cut a bouquet of lovely autumn flowers. I remember orange marigolds, yellow chrysanthemums, and red flowers of one type. She held up the bouquet and I admired it. Strangely enough there were carrots included in the assortment of flowers. She offered me a carrot and I ate it. When I returned home I found that someone had sent a bouquet of flowers and this surprised me. 

(220 words)

This is rather difficult to interpret. But recently I bought a bouquet of flowers for my parents' wedding anniversary and another bouquet was brought by relatives.

College women, late 1940s:#0573 (Code 078, Age 21, 10/06/47)I dreamt I was out riding with my cousin, age 40 and his wife, about 30. We rode along for sometime and finally a huge amusement park of some sort came into view. The place looked tremendously attractive. The buildings were painted in beautiful bright blues and reds. There were numerous neon lights radiating about. The above description makes the place sound rather garish but really there was a certain unique charm about it and we decided to stop there for awhile. It seems that I had heard something about this place before and from the conversation of my cousin it was apparent that it was very well known. When we entered I felt that I had once been here before, yet, I know of no actual place like it. We entered some sort of building which had a restaurant in one half and a photo studio in the other. A rather nondescript girl, employed at the studio, was showing us samples of their work in photography. The girl was rather young about my age, I imagine. The pictures were mostly bridal pictures. I can't remember anything else.

This place had large glass windows and looking in from the sidewalk where I was, I noticed that a funeral was just ending. The mourners were slowly advancing to the front of the room where the casket was displayed. The corpse was a fair-haired woman about 40 or so, dressed in a black gown. I never saw the face before. Some of the mourners were weeping as they approached the casket. I remembered to myself that I had never seen a dead person and was rather curious to see this one. That seems to be all.

I really can't find anything to relate this to. It might be just a rehashing of stray thoughts about the nearness of funeral homes to the campus.

I know her rather casually, having once doubled with her several months back. She is about 20. We were sitting around a table at some restaurant or other. She asked me what type of man I wanted to marry. I proceeded to tell her and she asked me first of all what height I preferred in a man. I answered 5' 10 ". Then she asked about preferred hair coloring. I really had no preference but after she suggested dark hair I agreed that I too preferred men with dark hair.

College women, late 1940s:#0576 (Code 078, Age 21, 10/24/47)I dreamt that my parents were planning a dinner party for 7:00. Preparations were not yet completed when the doorbell rang and our guests arrived. They were a middle-aged doctor and his wife, actual friends of ours. Mother was dressed in a black and white checked dress and in general the house was in an uproar. We seated our guests at a small table for two. There were two other large tables. one of these tables was occupied by Mother and Dad and several other relatives whom I can't remember. I too, sat with them. The third table was occupied by a group of unknowns, among whom were two girls who had been called to serve that evening. We proceeded with our meal and serving was done in a very inefficient manner. We had chicken, some sort of potatoes and green peas which were dished out into small plates. It seemed to take ages until all the tables were served from the central table where we sat. I kept thinking there wouldn't be enough to go around. Our two guests conversed continually with one another. I noticed that the table was littered with empty ginger ale bottles and told the two girls to clear them away.

This might be the aftermath of a week ago, when I was chairman of a large social gathering. The amount of food we ought to order, the type of serving that was to be done, and all such matters played on my mind for a long time. All went well, but the food almost did run out. Also, this evening the doorbell rang before I expected my date and not being ready, I was rather perturbed. This might have some connection with the early arrival of our dinner guests. I couldn't begin to explain this dream symbolically, but I suppose it has deeper connotations.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0577 (Code 078, Age 21, 10/24/47)I dreamt that a group of us, M-- students, were sitting around in a room in a building on the M-- campus. What this building is I don't really know. I had a vague impression that it was a room in the library, yet this particular place doesn't actually exist. While we were speaking with one another, an old woman, who looked well over 80, came into the room accompanied by a middle-aged woman attendent. The aged woman was dressed in a vivid lavender dress and had striking white hair. Her face was quite lined, and after she left one of the girls mentioned the fact that part of her face was paralyzed. I hadn't noticed this. Before the two women left, they glanced for sometime about the room. Then the oldest woman said, to one of the girls, "Do you know who I am?" The girl replied in the negative, and the woman told her that she was Mrs. H-- who had donated the money for the building we were in. She didn't reveal that she was the donor, but we all knew that she was. She had come to look around before she died, and was pleased to see that all was well here. Then she departed with her companion.

The only connection that I ran make out is that a short time ago I saw several regal dowagers walking through the campus and I somehow imagined them to be donors of one sort or another.

The little boy, who was blonde and blue-eyed was amazingly intelligent. I don't remember our conversation at all, but I do know that this child had almost a mature adult mind. The rapid transit came and the father and the child, along with an older son, about 12 or so boarded it. I went along too. While we rode I was conscious of the steel tracks in front of us and also was aware of the tremendous danger of rolling off the tracks when the rapid made its many turns. The motorman seemed to be aware of this danger too because he went very slowly and mentioned the danger of the slippery steel tracks which gleamed in the sun. The bright little boy sat with his older brother in front of the father. I sat next to the proud parent who gave me a further account of the prodigy. 

(315 words)

This dream may be a rehashing of some of the discussions in our education classes about the brilliant child. At the present time, I am more than ever conscious of little children, partly because of a Sunday School class which I have in which there are many bright youngsters about 6 years of age. Parents very frequently discuss their children with me. Because of the fact that the teaching field is new to me, I do have some apprehensions about dealing with some of the problems.

They sat together on the porch and when they both glanced at me, I noticed an amazing resemblance in their faces.

A middle-aged man was crouchlng before a blue smoky blaze and he mumbled and chanted in a loud voice. I understood that the murdered girl had been cremated and these were her last remains.

However, at that point I didn't particularly care and I was content and gay. I think this dream is simply a reflection of my state of mind at this particular period of my life.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0606 (Code 087, Age 24, 02/09/47)There was a rather large gathering of girls and boys, all college students in a living room. I didn't recognize the room at all and I didn't know all of the students. (I seemed to know the girls but very few boys.) We were all dressed in sports clothes or slacks, jeans & shirts. There was a phonograph playing. The boys then announced they were going to pick a queen. It was like a "hot of the blue." No one was prepared for it - it was a complete surprise. Nevertheless each of the girls had to take a turn encircling the room. After this announcement some other girls arrived on the scene nicely dressed in their good clothes. All this time I was sitting on the couch watching the others and I woke up before it was my turn to get up. I know I felt very mad when the alarm clock went off and woke me up. I had a feeling that I wanted to go back and find out what would have happened.

College women, late 1940s:#0607 (Code 087, Age 24, 02/15/47)I was with a large gathering of people my own age, most of whom I did not know. (Both sexes were present.) One of the boys was injured in some way. It was a boy (age 22) I had recognized as having been stationed at Ft. while I was there. I only knew him by sight. To my knowledge I was the only graduate nurse in the group so I did what I could to determine the nature of his injury & make him comfortable. However, there was a student nurse present who pushed forward & "took over the show." I, more or less submitted & stood by the sidelines. The ambulance & doctor arrived - & transported the boy to the hospital on a plank. The only symptom he seemed to have was a swelling, redness, tautness of the 3rd finger on his left hand. It was believed that he had a spinal injury. 

The scene changed to a hospital ward. Another nurse (same age) and I were with the patient. The doctor had just left, after arranging some pillows & blankets under the boy's back. Miss D. (32) a supervisor in Nursing arts, with whom I had previously worked came into the room & asked why the pillows had been arranged in such a fashion. She gave me the impression that she thought I was very stupid. Even though we told her that the doctor had arranged them in that manner, she changed them to what she believed was the best and correct way.

Mother had made a delicious apple pie. The crust was "utter perfection." Mother then went upstairs to made some telephone calls. I was to do the dishes. I sat talking to Daddy for a long while, however. Then I looked at my watch, saw that it was 7:30 pm, and decided that I had better get the dishes done before I left. I believe as I remember it that I had to be at some special place a little later in the evening. Daddy came out into the kitchen to help me. He got mad when he found out that I had put the remainder of the pie (not in a pie pan but in a bread pan) back into the oven. He said that the crust would get hard & tough. The gas was not on, however, and the door was open. I saw no difference in the outward appearance of the pie. Mother came down then and told us about the exorbitant prices they had charged for food in restaurants on New Year's Eve. I remember only one place & price she quoted. The SSS had charged 35 cents for a dab of mayonnaise and liver paste on a cracker.

I had not been eating any mayonnaise & liver paste although I like it a lot.

Next I was in a department store, walking around looking at the various displays. When I came to the dress department I saw a beautiful evening dress and asked to try it on. It was black, off the shoulder with red roses scattered over it. After I had it on I decided to get a thrill and walked regally down a winding staircase to the first floor. There the doorman could get a taxi for me and I could whirl away. However, I only got halfway down the staircase and then turned around and started back. I couldn't find the way and wandered all around. All I wanted to do now was get the dress off. Suppose someone should see me. Of course, people were milling all around me. On an elevator I heard about a dress that had been stolen. Some place along the way 2 of my girlfriends had joined me. Now we found a room that had been an old anatomy lab. One of the girl's boy friend was waiting for her outside. I changed my clothes. We seemed to have a great discussion as to whether we should all wear stockings or socks. They had socks on but I had to put on stockings because my shoes were brown oxfords. Then the women that had shown me the dress came in. I gave it to her.

The bus came and we all got on. G_____ got on first and sat in a seat with someone else. I got on and saw an empty seat that held three people right across from G_____. I thought, "Good, now J_____, A_____ and I can sit together. However, G_____ got up and sat down next to me before J_____ and A_____ had a chance to get back there.

College women, late 1940s:#0621 (Code 087, Age 24, 05/13/47)Several of my girl friends and I were in a deserted old farm house in the middle of enemy territory. The house had no furniture in it at all. (Except that later a crib appeared) We were sitting around not saying very much when we saw another girl and a child outside. We offered them shelter from the night and the soldiers. The chi]d, around 3-4 yrs., went to sleep in the crib. Shortly after that I saw a small group of enemy soldiers with flashlights coming toward the house. I ran to the crib and had to struggle to get the child out over the high sides. I kept hoping that the child would not start crying and yelling. My one object was to keep out of the way of the beams from the flashlights. I had to keep dodging around to do this, and could not get back to the front of the house where the others were. Once I felt the light shining on my face, but it moved on. To escape detection I put the baby and my se]f up against the outside wall of the house - (on the floor.)

College women, late 1940s:#0622 (Code 087, Age 24, 05/14/47)I don't know where I was but I had picked up a "Holiday" magazine and had accidentally opened it well toward the back. There was a colored picture on that page. I decided to look through the magazine but wanted to begin at the page where the first colored picture appeared. I thought it would be just 4 or 5 pages back so I began leafing through the pages going toward the front of the book. However, the colored pictures never seemed to stop and I got all the way to the front cover without coming across a single black and white page. I thought it was so strange. Most of the pictures were landscapes and nature studies. The coloring was simply beautiful in all of them. One of them I remember pictured a young girl in a yellow dress lying in the grass on a hill top looking up at the puffy white clouds rolling by. I was sorry when I woke up because I wanted to see more of the pictures.

There I saw two girl friends of mine sitting in class - taking notes. The boy and I just stood there and watched them take notes. When the class was over one of the girls, who in reality is a tall girl, came over and said "hello" to the fella I was with but not to me. Both she and he made me feel very little - in the dream they both seemed about six feet tall or over - which made me feel very small. I was angry when she said "hello" to him and not to me.

College women, late 1940s:#0630 (Code 089, Age 20, 04/14/47)I dreamed I was walking down a corridor in a University bldg. (One of which I had never seen before.) I met "E_____," one of the fellas I date. He ran over to me and tried to kiss me - He was with another girl who was "dressed up." She wore a black dress, pearls etc. I told him to stop bothering me and go back to his date. I told him at least I was the natural type (I was wearing bobby socks, skirt and sweater) and didn't get dressed up so "fancy" for class. As I was talking to him my best friend came down the hall with a fella. He looked exactly like "E_____" - but she called him "P_____." - The resemblance was amazing. 

(264 words)

That very evening my girl friend was telling me about the date she had with a fella called "P_____" - she told me that he was the same type as "E_____" - and that they looked very much alike. The part about E_____ wanting to kiss me in front of the girl and others too probably reflects the fact that he always in reality shows his affection for me in public - I dislike this and have told him many times to stop it. I stopped dating him for a few weeks - but I had "reports" of the other girls he dated in that time. Interpretation
That probably explains the "overdressed" girl in the dream.

We got to the floor we got out on - by then he was dead. The man holding my father said, "Take him" - I was terribly afraid even to look at him, & I was afraid that the people in the elevator would notice.

He's a chronic invalid, & in the dream he was regretting that he could never plan on marriage, because he wanted to marry me. Then I was discussing it with my mother - we both felt very sad about it. I told mother that a man I work with had just proposed to me, & I thought he was congenial & would make a good husband, but was not physically attractive to me, so I refused him--it was rather embarrassing.

One of the boys was outside--someone I'd met before--I was almost in hysterics by then & shaking--he took me in his arms and held me, then we sat down & I leaned on his shoulder & after awhile he kissed me gently. By then, feeling very tranquil, I went back to take minutes again. As I was coming back, the uproar hit me like a blow, & as I went in, I heard two of the boys talking about me. "Should we vote for her?" one of them asked, & the other answered, "I don't like her as a person, but she's got brains--I think I'll support her. I wonder if she's human, tho--cold as a fish."

It must have been early in the season because I remember seeing a girl with a beautiful tan and wishing that I had one as dark. Then suddenly I was standing in line, but I didn't know why. One of my girlfriends (a redhead age 19) was in back of me, and we began talking. Again the scene changed and I was in a beautiful castle, or mansion. There was very little light, but I wasn't alone. The last thing I remember was going upstairs. 

(222 words)

The second part, when I was in the mansion, I have no idea of what it means. However, the first part, when I was swimming, probably meant that I wish summer were here and that I could go swimming (this is my favorite sport).

College women, late 1940s:#0652 (Code 102, Age 21, 02/21/48)I was driving a shully-four foot cabin cruiser in a large lake. The water was calm and the air was slightly chilly. There was no one else on the boat; I was completely alone. Soon I landed the boat at the dock end went up to a cottage, where evidently I lived.

College women, late 1940s:#0653 (Code 102, Age 21, 02/21/48)It was summer and I was visiting my grandmother's farm. The sun was shining and there was a festive air about the house. We were all preparing to go someplace ("we" meaning my mother, grandmother, age 80, my two uncles, 45 and 48, and my aunt age 55) and I was busy sewing a button on my dress. Suddenly the scene changed and we were sitting in the car at town watching the people go by. However, they were people from my hometown and not from my grandmother's town. I saw my best girlfriend (age 22) walking by with my high school history teacher (about 40). They stopped to talk, and thats the last I remember.

As I looked out I saw a huge lawn with a group of people gathered under a tree. I decided to go out to see what they were doing. The scene changed to a basement. There were tables and chairs in it and I was sitting next to a girlfriend of mine (age 18). I looked around and saw a door which evidently led to a subbasement; the door opened and a young fellow came out with a package in his arms. Again the scene shifted and I was walking our dog on the green lawn.

It seemed strange seeing those things again, and knowing that we didn't live there any more.

College women, late 1940s:#0657 (Code 102, Age 21, 03/24/48)I was evidently living on a farm. It was very early when I got up and a beautiful day. The first thing I did was to go to the chicken coop and feed the chickens. I started to go back to the house. The scene changed and I was sitting in a car with my cousin (female, age 22). We were watching the people go by--it was Saturday night in town. The band began to play, very much off-key. Everything was quite natural until a horse came on the scene and calmly walked down the sidewalk. Then I woke up.

As I was in the market for a house I decided to buy one of them. But suddenly I noticed railroad tracks to my left and the atmosphere seemed to change. I looked over to where the houses had been and then everything seemed to recede in the distance. There were hills and little buildings and winding paths.

The first page I was able to read, but soon the words became indistinct and try as I might, I couldn't make out what they said. Suddenly I was conscious of a change.

College women, late 1940s:#0661 (Code 102, Age 21, 04/17/48)I was in a very large house, one that I had never been in before. Each room that I went in was different than the one before. The furnishings were in modern style and the colors were bright (mostly green, orange, blue, red). I was amazed at the beauty of the home and the elegance of the furnishings. Suddenly the scene changed. I was at home and the mailman left a package for me. It was my watch strap which I had been waiting a long time for.

College women, late 1940s:#0663 (Code 102, Age 21, 05/04/48)Again I was in a large house, but this time it wasn't a strange one. It was a fraternity house of another college. There were books and magazines all over the place and there was also a library there. The scene changed and I was standing before an easel painting a scene. It was of two houses, one very pretty and the other very old and rather nondescript. Suddenly I decided I wanted to visit the new house so I did. There were people in it, but none of them were familiar to me. I remember looking out over some water (a lake or river). Again I was back in the fraternity house. Someone I knew in the dream evidently (but not in real life) was playing the piano and I was listening. We decided to go down to the recreation room and it wasn't until we went down the steps that I recognized who I was with. He had trouble getting downstairs because he had an artificial leg (age 22).

On the letter and postcard were pictures of S--. One scene was of a village with mountains in the background. It was beautiful and the colors were gorgeous. My girlfriend and I were in the gas station getting fuel for the car. The station was on a hill. Suddenly the scene shifted and I was in a classroom. I sat down in a chair that had several coats on it. Again the scene changed. It was raining and I was reading the election headlines in the paper. Wallace's name was there, but all I remember was something about rain being mentioned.

College women, late 1940s:#0674 (Code 106, Age 20, 03/??/48)The February freshman class at Art School was making a tour of the school. We seemed to walk in rows of two's although there wasn't much order and you were walking with a different person every few minutes. We passed the auditorium balcony where the rest of the school was having some sort of an assembly. The doors were open and we heard a boy make horrible noises on his accordion. The freshman class was very noisy, and I thought they should be quiet and not disturb the assembly. I got into an argument with one of the girls and told her she should not be so selfish. We continued arguing even when we passed into another hall. When we were through with the tour, our class met in one of the rooms where a woman was talking. I didn't listen, but talked to my girlfriend about my cousin and showed her a button he sent me from a New Zealand soldier's uniform. We wondered if the woman who was talking would know what the button was. The class was dismissed. 

After a time, our class joined the other assembly. I was going to sit on the balcony, but then I saw a boy who I liked very much and I started to go to where he was sitting. There were about five, empty chairs near him. There was a box on each chair and as I moved in the aisle, I threw away each box until I got next to him and I sat one seat away from this boy. There seemed to be a show on the stage and different girls would be called up to the stage to sing. I said to this boy one seat away, "Oh, dear! They're going to call me to sing and I can't sing!"

When I picked up the phone to call, he left. So then I kept watching him. I wanted to get back to my house, so I took a secret way. Suddenly I was in our spare bedroom looking out at a bunch of orange bushes. (129 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#7 I wore dentures and I couldn't keep them in my mouth. I was in this big, empty room and I kept trying to put my dentures in.

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#8 I was at the opera with my friend Rachel and someone else. Our seat was 40D. I remember thinking how underdressed I was because no one told me we were going to the opera. We asked an usher where our seat was and he said just keep walking, the aisle merges right. When we got to row 40 I turned around and Rachel and the other person had disappeared and I couldn't find them anywhere. (75 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#9 I had a dream that I was at my friend Karen's house. I haven't seen her in eight years. I was helping her mom clean. I knew a great way to clean the toilet and the tub. I said I knew tricks because of a household book I had. We were waiting for the kids to get back from gymnastics camp. I asked Karen's mom what gym camp they were coming from. We stepped out of her house and the train with the kids pulled in. One of the cars was shaped like a big VW Bug and it was orange. All of the little kids were at the front of the train and when they got out, they had big bags of cookies and goodies that their mom sent them. One little kid offered me a cookie, but I didn't take it. Then one little girl asked me if I had seen the Smith babies. I asked Karen's mom if Helen Smith Seibert had gotten married. She said yes, and that she had two babies. (176 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#10 I was at work and on the phone talking to a travel agent. We were talking about airfare to somewhere for me. I don't remember where. Then he said it would have to be more expensive. I asked him why and he said, "Because I need to pay for my office. It has big gates surrounding it." And then there was this small earthquake. The travel agent said it must be very big in his city, but where I was didn't feel it very much. But then there was a huge earthquake and I was standing in a doorway, hoping that nothing would fall on me. (106 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#11 I was at work and the U.S. Dream Team (basketball) checked in. I was so excited. Charles Barkley checked in for everyone. I was excited also because he had the same silver pen that I have. I put them in rooms 110 and 209. I couldn't believe that I didn't know that they were coming. They all unloaded off a huge bus. Then later I remembered that Grant Hill was on the team; I wanted to see him but I never did. Then this white player came in, but I don't know who he was. And he stayed in the office and talked to me. I was so excited and kept thinking to myself, "I want to marry an NBA player so badly." Then he left, but he said he would be back. He left his glasses on the counter, but he didn't come back. Then later my manager was in the office with me and there were two men in the office. One was talking at the same time as the other. I figured that I would answer one of the men's questions and she would answer the other's. Well, she was expecting me to answer both. She wanted one of the men to stop talking, so she "shhhh'd" me and got mad at me. Then I was really annoyed and frustrated. (223 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#12 I was at work and these two old ladies came in. They worked at my work, even though in real life they don't work with me. For some reason the old lady was mad at me and she grabbed my bead necklace. I got very mad and said, "Don't touch my necklace." Then I pushed her down and said, "How would you like me to flush your wedding ring down the toilet?" Then this guy I work with slapped her. (80 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#13 I came into work and no one was there, but there were lots of empty pizza boxes and soda cans laying around. I had a green slug in my pocket and I remember picking it up and putting it there. For some reason I didn't want to touch it, so it crawled out of my pocket and stretched very long and climbed onto the counter and then it got really big and fat -- huge. Then there were these two little slugs crawling around and I wondered, "Where did they come from?" (92 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#14 I came into work and my manager was there. She was mad that I hadn't done the maids' schedule for next pay period, even though it wasn't my job.

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#15 I dreamt that I had a huge pimple on my face and I couldn't resist picking it. When I picked at it, this huge long white worm came out. I kept pulling at it and I could practically feel it coming out of my face. It was very long. (49 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#16 I am laying in bed and I feel little pricks at my legs. I stand up and start walking. Someone says, "You have blood on your legs."

I go to the mirror and all I can see are spider bites and blood covering the back of my legs. (75 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#17 I am in this huge auditorium and it is a celebration for our college graduation. However, everyone there is from my high school for a reunion to celebrate college graduation. Everyone was there. It was so big. Gwen (my best friend from high school) wasn't there, however. I remember sitting on my knees and I was wearing a tight skirt and it was pulled up so my underwear showed. Then a well-known TV host pulled it down and I wasn't embarrassed at all. Then at the front of the auditorium they were doing little skits and they called me down for one, but I didn't want to do it. Then someone told me it was a skit about the 60's and if you do it, you get a bong hit, so I did it. It was weird. I stood in line and when it got to be my turn, I walked up to this desk and signed a piece of paper that this boy gave me to sign. Then I went to get my bong hit. The bong was being passed around, so I walked around and saw so many people from my graduating class. Finally I found the bong and my friend came over with me. I asked him for a lighter and he gave it to me, but I couldn't get it to work at all, so I ended up having to use matches. (236 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#18 I am in this huge arena and it is packed with people. I am at the very top of the arena and I start walking down the aisle. As I get to the center, I realize that there is a concert going on. It is very crowded, I realize that the group is New Kids on the Block. They all looked so cute and I was so excited to be there. Then Joe from the band saw me and smiled. I was so happy. Then he pointed at me and walked down the stage stairs and took my hand. That's all I remember. (103 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#19 I was back in high school walking down the corridors during passing time.

So then I go back to the bow and look around. The weird thing about my dream is that I never really saw my mom. (89 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#21 I was watching Saturday Night Live and they were doing a parody of Fantasy Island. There were six huge muscular men holding back Tattoo. They were like those really butch gay men in leather and wearing black leather pants and vests. They won't let Tattoo go and he keeps saying, "Let me go, let me go, I need to go." Finally they let Tattoo go and he runs to this huge puff of smoke. Then Tattoo says to the men, "Do you see what happened? You didn't let me warn him." It was never stated, but the moral was that since Tattoo could not warn Ricardo Montablan about the plane, the plane hit him. (114 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#22 I was with Bob and we went to this hotel to meet with one of his friends. I think it was this guy Donald, and right after we met, we went into the bathroom and he laid over the bathtub and I gave him a blow job.

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#23 I am at this party and Melanie is there. There are lots of people. I am going somewhere that Melanie's friend is going, so Melanie asks me if I'll take her friend for her. I said that I will let her know when I am leaving. I walk around this party and it is in such a big building. I walk down the stairs and then the building was also a store. I was looking through the soaps and some other girl in the aisle was looking for shower gel. She wanted Lemon cream flavored, but she couldn't find it, so she asked someone that worked there. They told her to go to Woolworth's and they might have that flavor. They said, "Look on the ground level at Woolworth's." Then I went to find Melanie and when I found her, I told her I was ready to go. She had decided that she was going to the place that I was going to. She asked me if I could still take her friend to where she needed to go. I said, "I will still take her, but we need to leave when I say I need to leave. I can't wait around for her all night," and Melanie said that it was no problem. (214 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#24 I was sitting at work, very bored, and no one was there, so I smoked some pot. Then I noticed that my boss was coming there soon. I knew I had to open doors and turn on the fans, but my boss came in before I could get around to it. When she walked into the office, she sniffed around and gave me a dirty look. She said I could leave, so I left, but I forgot my backpack. I didn't realize that I didn't have it until I was at the store. I went back to work and asked my manager for my backpack. She threw all of my books at me and I asked her if she looked through it. She had found my pot and was very angry. She said that they would have to have a big meeting about the problem. Then I was in this room with a bunch of people that I didn't know. (160 words)

David: teenage dreams:#1 (01/02/90)I was in the Grammar School playground, and this time Angela had taken off to somewhere in the school. So I ran over to Julie and asked her if she knew where Angela was, and she said: "I can't tell you that." At first I thought she was just being a bitch about it. But then I asked her why. Then she sort of laughed and said: "I haven't seen her all day. Why don't you talk to her brother over there?" So then I walked over to the bus stop. I was greeted by a 7-foot-tall giant of a dork who said: "Who the hell are you?" I said: "I'm David, have you seen Angela? He said, "Yeah, she's in the school building." I said, "Great," and started walking to the school. He stopped me, gave me a giant slab of masking tape rolled up to look like a joint the size of a cigar. He said, "first let's play some games." We both walked out into the street to a cone, then stood there until a truck came by. Then we'd wait until the truck was a little bit away, then we'd run into the bushes pretending to swear in Spanish. We did this five or six times, then I woke up. (214 words)

David: teenage dreams:#2 (01/13/90)Funny dream last night. Kinda hard to remember it all, except Steve and I were doing a lot of serious ass-kicking, and what's really funny, Michelle, who I haven't even given thought to in months, asked me out in this dream, in this soft, weak voice. I was either playing a video game or a pinball game, or I was kicking a soda machine that wouldn't give me its soda. Anyway, I was preoccupied, and when I heard her say "Wanna go out with me," I stopped with an amused look on my face, and, after a silence -- presumably I was thinking -- I said, "Sure, guess so." I woke up then at 9:30. (115 words)

David: teenage dreams:#3 (01/14/90)Last night I had a dream I was in Payless, wearing my boots. I was returning a pair of shoes, I don't know if I got a new one or not, but I was thinking about returning mine. (38 words)

David: teenage dreams:#4 (01/14/90)I was outside my house, at dusk, with Steve and Matt. I was wearing my boots. Also, Bill Murray was with us. we were running up and down the side of my road on that rise, like I used to do, when all of a sudden there were dogs. I remember my dog was there, and I knew the rest, but I can't remember them. Then I had a memory of something in a book (probably a hunting book) and I yelled something that made the dogs go away, but not before many bites by all of them. (98 words)

David: teenage dreams:#5 (01/14/90)I was in K-Mart, by some kind of loudspeaker. I popped in a King Diamond tape called "The Dark Side" and was playing "No Presents for Christmas". And in the beginning I was thinking about how "Santa Claus couldn't know about everyone, because it's physically impossible." I told Steve I played the song and he giggled. (56 words)

David: teenage dreams:#6 (01/25/90)I drove the Buick to the DMV to get it insured. (11 words)

David: teenage dreams:#7 (01/26/90)Our whole school went on this trip to Spain or France, I think, at any rate. The jet landed at the school, and everyone got out and went into the Pavillion. There were like 20 pay phones in there. I saw Angela walk towards the phones, I watched her for a sec, then cut in front of her. (58 words)

David: teenage dreams:#8 (02/18/90)It was nighttime, and cold; I could see my breath. I was an outcast because the friends I had chosen were not socially acceptable. I was condemned to walk along on the grass and concrete for an unknown time. All of a sudden I meet Angela along the way. For some unknown reason I asked her what her name was. We talked and walked for a good twenty minutes and had a great conversation going. I felt great. (78 words)

David: teenage dreams:#9 (03/02/90)For a while I dreamt I was having sex with Lisa and Cara. When we were done they sort of left and I hooked the modem up to my computer and I tried to call the BBS that was toll free. I never could make it through, and I set up a large "boat-anchor" TV. And I started watching a horror movie. It seemed all this was happening in the middle of the night. In the morning (in the dream) I went to B.J.'s house. I spent the night there, and every time I went out of the room to get water or something, I'd open the wrong door somewhere and my eyes would get to feast upon dead bodies and people and animals, all dead. Once I found Alice Cooper in a room with a 50's style band crowded in around him all behind tattered white sheets. All the people's skin was blue. The next morning I walked to Guitar Showcase. They were having a party there, and a guy named Heavy Harv was hosting. I pictured Heavy Harv as a 50 year old Mexican who wore 70's style clothes, with his shirt wide open. The funny thing was, they announced they were using Steve's records! I was hanging out by the wall, talking to some chick. I have no idea who it was, because in the dream, I never actually turned my head to look at her. I ended up buying something to hold pencils that cost eighty-nine cents. (251 words)

David: teenage dreams:#10 (04/13/90)There was this girl with long brown hair. She was pretty. She was dressed in these green sweatclothes. She was being a bitch because she was making fun of me and my friends and laughing at the same time. She had two friends with her. Finally I got tired of it, and I pulled out a strip of metal, a thick metal bar. I hit her with it gently but firmly three times on her sides, legs. Then I suddenly hit her on the back of the neck. It went halfway through and I pulled it out. There was no blood, just a dark line where it went in. Everybody but myself ran away from her. Then I woke up. (120 words)

David: teenage dreams:#11 (04/17/90)For some reason the school was at the Camp again. A bunch of girls from the school were doing a strip tease in the eating hall. It was pretty cool until Lisa noticed me watching, put her clothes back on and pushed me out of the room. (47 words)

David: teenage dreams:#12 (04/17/90)I had this other one where I was at that dead field where they're building the homes. It was pre-dusk, same time most of my dreams are. The dead field was still there, though, and Steve had parked a new trailer there. A new trailer! We hung out there and listened to records 'til twilight, then I had to go home. (61 words)

David: teenage dreams:#13 (06/16/90)I am in hell. It is a frozen, barren wasteland filled with screaming souls. The icy wind cut through my skin like daggers. Satan appears as a huge black cloud that demons flew around, changing from twisted shape to twisted shape. (41 words)

David: teenage dreams:#14 (06/20/90)I dreamt Mr. N had a gun, and was holding all the 6th grade teachers (but Mr. P) and a bunch of students hostage in his classroom. I think Mr. M owed money to Mr. N, so he got the hostages. He was getting ready to shoot James because Mr. M was taking too long. So Cara stopped him by stalling him. She stalled him right until this part ended. Then I dreamt I woke up, and went outside to play frisbee with my grandpa! It was on Green Drive, and I accidentally threw the frisbee over the highway near Green Drive. Right then Chris ("Smokey") came by. He was dressed up in a colorfully striped Dairy Queen uniform. He had a great big map and asked me for loose change! (131 words)

David: teenage dreams:#15 (06/10/91)Tim was in bed with two girls. I climbed in and did drugs with them. I was down by a lake. Richard was trying to drown me. There was an open garage. A black guy was running for his life towards it and Matt was chasing him. (47 words)

David: teenage dreams:#16 (05/17/92)Set in a desert, at night. I had taken a trip in an airplane with Amy. She was wearing the traditional desert garb, for fun it seems. I was wearing a coat. Apparently, we had broken some kind of law because we were about to be executed with guns by soldiers on a stretch of the desert. Time passes. Back in the desert. Amy and I have escaped execution somehow. Rumors reach me that Tara is also in the area, and has been attacked. I run into her eventually and seems she has been stripped of clothing, but not much else. I am angry that someone would do that. I provide her my coat. She is very flustered and I find that I have to comfort her. When she has calmed down, I find Amy and we all find refuge in a cave, in which we fall asleep. There is a moment of darkness, and then I wake up (for real). (161 words)

David: teenage dreams:#17 (05/17/92)I'm in the computer room at school, only the windows are gone. Mr. S is not there. Instead, there is some woman with very short hair. I scrawl a name that isn't mine on the wall with a pen, and wipe it off later. Later I am still at school, only now in the theater room. Mrs. P announces that she is going to try a musical rendition of her lesson. I tell her that I play the guitar, and will be happy to learn the guitar part. Amy is near me. She asks to be taught a few chords. (After class.) I teach her the chords A, C, and E. (111 words)

David: teenage dreams:#18 (07/22/92)Amy and I were together, watching some show on a couch, and she was massaging my back. (17 words)

David: teenage dreams:#19 (11/05/92)Heather and I were in the kitchen. She was sitting on the counter, speaking in Spanish. I tried to talk to her, but all that would come out was French. She jumped down and put her arms around me and kissed me, but we couldn't communicate. No matter how hard we tried, neither of us could understand what the other was saying, and for some reason, neither of us could force our lips to make English words. (77 words)

David: teenage dreams:#20 (01/22/93)I drove my car to school, and parked it behind the music building, right up next to the fence. I had something in my hand which my inner voice kept referring to as a Blitz, and I didn't want it. It looked a lot like a candybar. I rolled down my window and threw the Blitz out. The Blitz struck the fence with a hollow rattling sound and dropped from sight. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#21 (01/22/93)I was walking down Green Drive in the middle of the night, heading from Quik Stop back to home. It was raining very hard, and I was wearing a raincoat. I got to the shopping center, and I went into the parking lot. I looked around myself, and my attention centered upon Home Video. So I pulled a key out of my pocket and unlocked the door, pushing the door open and walking inside as I did so. The interior of this building was not much; it was about six feet square and looked like a repair shop for VCR's. Parts of VCR's lay strewn about the floor. I grabbed a movie, after much consideration, and left five dollars on the counter. My biggest concern at this point was to get back out with the movie in hand and yet not be suspected by the police as a theif. For some reason, I could not get back outside for a long time. This dream ended when I crossed the threshold into the parking lot. (174 words)

David: teenage dreams:#22 (01/22/93)In my last major dream, it was wartime. Rather, it was as though a war had passed, and I was the bodiless witness to the carnage. My attention focussed upon one poor man's bloody upper torso. His body had been ripped away from the waist down, and his eyes stared blankly into the void. He had a crewcut, and in portions of his facial skin, you could see the underlying skull. I could tell, from my astral vantage point, that he had begun to rot. 

Suddenly a dog came along. It was a small dog, perhaps six inches tall, opne foot long. Brown patches splotched its fur. I do not know whether the patches were natural or the result of some other occurrence. At any rate, the dog too took an interest in the carcass, and grabbed the man by the arm, dragging him along to wherever it was going. The dog dragged this man over hills and rocks, through fields and lakes, through forests and mountains. As the dog did all this, little bits and pieces of the man kept falling off- he was being eroded away. Finally the dog came to rest with the man's remains, and I realized that they were laying at my feet.

I knelt down and examined the man. He had been nearly completely decomposed; he now had no chest, with the notable exception of a few jagged ribs. His skull was nearly intact, but now he had no eyes. Most of his skin had fallen away, only leaving a large sheet covering his back (which was unusual, since the dog had been dragging the man along his back- not his frontside!) The man's arm's (now skeletl) were intact. During this examination, I left my own body and became a witness to the scene. I think I was watching from the point of view of the dog, because I was low to the ground. This dream self said: "Wait, there's been a mistake. This man is not quite dead yet!"

Then I was watching the scene from above my own head. I saw blood pulsing within the skin of the skeletal form, and I began thinking to myself: "Oh god. This is going to be like one of those cheesy horror movies where the skeleton comes to life and strangles the guy." but that was not what happened. Down there, I pulled out a gun and tried to shoot the skeleton, but the shot did not harm it. Its jaw worked, and it reached for an antenna which was laying nearby.

It aimed the antenna at me, and it pulled an imaginary trigger. My head was suddenly filled with the wrenching noise of a telephone's ring, and suddenly, I understood what the skelton was trying to show me. It was illustrating for me that men are forced to be like machines in war. Further, when machines perform their duties, it is like getting a phone call; they (the machines) always involve people in some way. Conversely, when a man is killed it is as though he is receiving a phone call from the gods. The man always finds a way to involve one of them in his death. Hah! (535 words)

David: teenage dreams:#23 (01/23/94)I had a school dream last night. It was actually kind of frustrating. I wanted to get my classes changed, but first, I wanted to get my geometry class changed back to Mr. St's. I suppose I was at someone else's house, and Mr. St called, to check on this person, to see if they were cutting class. I connected Mr. St to the parents of the household, and as I hung up, I commented: "You know, Mr. St *does* sound like Rush Limbaugh over the phone." 

"Thank you!" I heard him reply. Then I hit a button to hang up.

Then I was standing in a long line at his desk. All these people, including me, wanted to get back into his class. The line was so long, that I whipped out an entire steak dinner and began to eat it in line. By the time the line had gotten down to the last few people and me, I only had one bite left on my plate: some of the steak. So I bit into it. It was the worst, most god-awful steak I had ever had in my entire life, I was sure of it. It was dry, and tasted like roast beef. What's worse, as soon as I began chewing it, the bite expanded in my mouth and filled it with this awful roast beef stuff. I had to let everyone else go ahead of me, and I still wasn't able to talk by the time Mr. St had gotten up and left. So I fell asleep (in the dream), and when I woke up again, I was again at the end of a line. I stood up, and I found that my balance was so bad that I kept falling down every time I stood up. Again, by the time I had finally gotten my balance back, Mr. St had gotten up and left. That was frustrating. (321 words)

David: teenage dreams:#24 (01/24/94)My brother and I were standing outside of a giant green lake. I knew that this was a "sea world" kind of thing, where there were shows and stuff. At any rate, we were standing on a ledge which was perched over this giant pool with green water, and I noticed two people in the far corner of the lake: an old lady in a diving suit and my dad, talking to her. My brother, I guess, fancied himself a performer of some sort, and he was standing at the very edge of our ledge, threatening to jump into the lake at the next exhibit. I could see that he held in his hand several sheets of music, professionally printed, with each bar being two half-note chords, second-inversion ninth chords in C. Each chord was the same chord. I could see seaweed and other things floating around in the lake, and I decided to ask my brother whether jumping in was such a good idea; does he know how deep it is in there? 

My brother replied, insolently; "Of course I do! I know what I'm doing!"

So I laughed. The next show was going to be the killer whale show, and when it was announced, my brother hesitated, long enough to see a monstrous black shark-looking thing emerge from the water. The lake had, at some point, changed into an incredible swimming pool, but the water remained green, and everone remained where they were. My brother decided not to jump. He laughed kind of feebly, and said: "Oh, maybe you're right, David." Then he sort of faded away. The next thing I knew, I was in the water. The giant "killer whale" was coming towards me, but I didn't care, because killer whales are reputed to be harmless. I wouldn't drown, anyway, because I was walking on the water. So the giant killer whale careened at me, and I'm not sure what happened next, but at some point I ended up in the water, with the killer whale some distance away. I swam up, up, up, and the water followed me. The old lady in the suit warned me: "you're not going to want to have such a strong reaction to him."

It didn't help, anyway, because soon enough, the killer whale had pinned me against the towering pool wall and was trying earnestly to roll me into a pulp. I woke up feeling spasms in my back which simulated the way I felt in the dream. (418 words)

David: teenage dreams:#25 (01/25/94)Well, I don't remember any dreams, per se, but I do remember a vision of a stack of videos, all with blue covers, like the ones Home Video has, and they were all marked with X's. (36 words)

David: teenage dreams:#26 (12/14/94)Last night I had the most convoluted dream about Laura, Josh, Hannah, Grace, and Grace's poetry that she had written for Andy Warhol. In the dream, poetry was represented by these very geometric, and angular figures, with strange curves and endpoints. I tried to make a drawing of them when I woke up but didn't do it very well. Not least because they were 3-dimensional. You wrote them into the thin air with your pen. In the dream, I drew a "poem" from Hannah's chin, and I said: "You're a poet now!" We all laughed. I seem to remember the dream was mainly about looking for Laura. She was around, just hard to approach because she was elusive. (118 words)

David: teenage dreams:#27 (06/14/95)Alright. I'm in J City, but it's sometime way in the future, so the city is as big as Los Angeles. For some reason it's really warm and humid, and feels like San Antonio. The first few seconds of my dream are set in the daytime. I drive my car up to the top of this really big hill, and I come to an intersection where I can't make a right turn for some reason; it's a one way in the other direction or something... at any rate, the road is blocked off. So I park my car in this downtown section where all the buildings are sort of greenish. It reminds me of what I think of when I think "Jungle". The air is really, really humid. At any rate, I'm either looking around for a Chinese restaurant or my friend's house. I can't remember which but it may have been both. One way or another, I keep getting lost in this little tiny two-block area of huge green buildings, and this really attractive Italian woman comes around in front of me and says: "You're ----, aren't you?" She said some name, but it wasn't mine in real life. It was mine in the dream, though. So I said "Yes, I am." I probably would have agreed if she didn't say my name. She was absolutely gorgeous. 

Anyway, it's been nighttime for a few hours, dream time. I have not been able to find the Chinese restaurant. So the Italian woman takes me by the hand and leads me through all these wierd back streets among these green-tinted buildings and we finally arrive at this one nice looking house that looks sort of like a greenhouse with wooden frames. Plants are growing everywhere, and I keep hearing congo drums someplace. So I get into this house, and the woman sits me down in the kitchen, at the counter, on a stool, like it's a bar or something. Then, she just kind of disappears, not to return until later in the dream. I get pretty bored listening to the congo drums, and so I get up to look for the Italian woman. Then I find this little tiny room with an absolutely huge mattress on the ground, tons of congo drums everywhere, and a REAAAAAALLLLLY fat guy playing the congos.

So as soon as he sees me, he jumps up and shakes my hand. He's really sweaty. I almost don't want to touch his hand. He's wearing this white cotton T-shirt that doesn't quite fit, so his belly is just everywhere. It's really gross to look at, so I look away. Apparently this fat guy is some kind of amazing musician that gets paid millions an hour to play congos, and he has this entire house just for playing music. Or so he says.

So we go back out into the kitchen, and along the way, he loses about 200 pounds. For some reason, it doesn't matter that much to me when that happens. The Italian woman is back in the kitchen, now wearing an apron. Now a really good looking blond woman has joined her. The fat guy introduces me to them, but I can't remember their names. Now, this blond kinda skinny guy arrives on the scene. he has longish hair, and he looks a lot like the male version of the blond woman. So there's a few minutes of conversation, and the fat guy drops another whole load of fat, and now he's starting to look pretty average. He eventually suggests that we all go back into the bedroom, and we all go back into the bedroom. Then we all take off our clothes. A few moments ensue, which aren't really sexual on anyone's part, just a lot of kissing and stuff. Then, The fat guy, who by now looks great, and the skinny blondish guy have an announcement to make.

The by-now great looking guy says: "Well, the two of us are... straight," then they look at each other, "but we're gay, too."

The blond woman is obviously disgusted, and she says so: "Oh my god, that is so gross. Here, let me show you this." And she immediately produces a copy of "THE WIZARD OF OZ"!! She says, "Here, read the last three pages," and starts ranting. I refuse to read the last three pages, and she hits me over the head with the book. I put my clothes back on and kept looking for that Chinese restaurant. (753 words)

David: teenage dreams:#28 (09/01/95)I'm making out with Laura in my room and there's a bar of this white deodorant-like stuff. It's caky. This is supposed to be spermicide. She grabs it and we strip down. She rubs the "spermicide" all over her body, lays on the bed, cocks her pelvis upwards and claims: "I'm receptive!" But I've had to piss the whole time, so I tell her I'll go do that. But as I run for the bathroom I hear my family come home. I scramble and get the key for my room so I can get back in there without letting on there's someone in there, much less Laura in such a "receptive" mood. My brother asks me why I'm locking my room and I tell him bluntly that there are things in there I don't want him to see. I still have to urinate, but while I'm trying to lock the door, Nick uses the bathroom. My mother walks into the bathroom, and then walks back out, assuring me that there is "plenty of garbage" in that bathroom. By now, the feeling that I have to piss is so strong I feel I'll burst. My mother keeps going back into the bathroom and coming out, assuring me there's "plenty of garbage" in there. In frustration I finally just start pissing all over the walls in the hallway.

David: teenage dreams:#29 (09/01/95)I dreamt I woke up at seven and got ready for school. I got in an argument with my brother and ended up one hour late for class. In between two classes I made a quick jaunt down the coast. (40 words)

David: teenage dreams:#30 (12/24/95)Something about the Capitol building in Washington DC. The stairs were greased. I also remember looking at photographs of a young, very attractive, mousy woman who was supposed to be named Cheryl. These were photographs of the young Cheryl, who supposedly was old and decrepit by now. (47 words)

David: teenage dreams:#31 (12/25/95)My father was searching for a job. I can't remember what happens next. I need to go to work, but my brother's walkman has a leak in it. And my car (actually Jimmy's hatchback) is "broken", though my Dad drives it down to the Chevron station to get it fixed. 

I need my car to get to work, but in the meantime, I go down to Jimmy's house for a bit. When I walk back up, there's some kind of bear/cat/monkey creature in the road. It has a dark, black face like a monkey, and sharp fangs and claws like a cat. It has light grey fur all over it's body, and bounds around on all fours. It is scared of me, so as I stroll up the road, it leaps up into the trees and walks back around me. I figured it was going to go back to eat the stalks of grass, so I didn't care much. But the next thing I knew, with a symphonic crash, the bear thing has bitten into my hand, and we are spinning around in a circle rapidly. We get into a huge struggle, but miraculously, I just get scratched up as if I were fighting a cat. The dust clears, and I somehow get the cat thing to call a truce. We start to walk up the road together, and it stands erect and turns into a human being. I comment, "I should have told you I wasn't going to hurt you. That might have saved you some trouble." He replied, "Yes. I would probably have gone right back to eating."

We get to my house and we walk over to the deck. Jimmy's waiting there for us. Just then my Dad re-surfaces in the car. My Dad walks over to me. He's wearing a dark blue uniform that looks like a policeman's uniform, or a military uniform. It is well fitting and has plenty of shiny brass buttons, as well as a short-brimmed policeman's style hat. He pushes his hat back on his head. The bear person disappears. I notice for the first time that over my Dad's right breast is a patch with an American flag and the Chevron symbol. "I got a job!" he says, "At Chevron! Although they're closed..."

"They're closed?! I have to get to work in..." I look at my wristwatch and see that I have half an hour before I must go to work. My Dad says, "That's O.K. Now that I've got a job there, I've got all the tools!" And then he immediately sets to work on my (Jimmy's) car.

Meanwhile, my cuts and bruises are just throbbing, so I rush down to the bathroom and strip naked so I can see what damage has been done. I am covered with shallow slices, all of which have already scabbed over. I still go for an application of Trisporic everywhere, which burns. I notice that my black mug is filled with mint tea, and I'm careful not to get any dandruff, hair, snot, blood, etc in it. I take a big gulp of it, and find that it's lukewarm. I remember that I left it there several days before, and marvel at the cup's ability to keep things warm. Then I search around in the medicine cabinet behind the mirror for painkiller pills, and I swallow them down with tea. Out loud, I say: "This really keeps things warm, I can't believe it! I left it here like a week ago and it's still warm!"

Next, for some reason, I pull out two large pieces of tinfoil, and suddenly feel the urge to put something repulsive in them. I start to throw up, but then I remember I just took some medicine, so throwing up for fun would just be a real waste of medicine. I stop myself just in time and manage to keep my stomach down. The next thing I consider is taking a shit in the tinfoil, but I discard that idea right away, because it would probably be too squishy and I would probably get some on my hands. I give up, and I start to crumple the foil together, when I suddenly get AN IDEA! I hock up, and attempt to spit out, an enormous mouth-sized snot and phlegm ball. It is spongy and porous. My revulsion at this repulsive choice wakes me up. (736 words)

David: teenage dreams:#32 (12/25/95)A massive quest for pornography. Everyone was searching for porn. It's too vague for me to remember, but I recall videos laying in the street, a magazine on a table. Then I ended up at the junior college library, which was a horseshoe shaped parking lot/cafe/criogenic freezing lab. Everything was dark and smoky. I walked up one of the aisles and noticed a coffee-and-muffins stand. I thought to myself: 'How hypocritical. This is just like a movie theater. They tell you to leave your food and drinks outside and then sell you coffee and muffins while you read.' I had dived into the 'library' to avoid Eric, an irritating friend. That's when I noticed the criogenic freezing slabs. There were five of them, and each had a Windows display on the side of the slab. The slabs were orange concrete, and the criogenically frozen people were all just laying on top of the big orange blocks, under a set of flashing sheets. Each block was numbered, but only four had people laying on top. The life status of these four were displayed on the Windows 'status bar'. This information was transmitted via wires in the flashing sheets. I then realized that these slabs weren't real at all, but a publicity stunt orchestrated by Devo. I laid down on the free one and pretended to be asleep, under the criogenic flashing glow-in-the-dark electronic Devo sheets. Eric came along and looked. "How long you been asleep, man?" he asks. I didn't respond. Someone told him to check out the display. Eric went away eventually, and I decided to get a book. I eventually found a copy of Finnegans Wake, only it was in this orange folio edition. It looked exactly like a book of methanol and ethanol emissions ratings that I had just returned. I ran around the library, waving this folio in hand, proclaiming: "Everybody should read this book! The questions to everything are in here!" The edition came off of somebody's typewriter. I opened it up to the first page, and recopied the bottom printed half onto the blank top half of the page, thinking all the while that "this page needs some filling." It occured to me that since Joyce was a Catholic, it's likely that some of the answers to the questions in Finnegans Wake are in the Bible. I search for a Bible in the library, but on the shelf in place of Bible, between two books, is a large, soft blueberry muffin, abandoned to fate. I eat it. (422 words)

David: teenage dreams:#33 (12/28/95)I lived in this strange house, where video games, toys and other inanimate objects came to life and mixed with the living. It started at school. I was going around, trying to take my finals. I get to my PE and Math finals, and look on my sheet of paper. Damn! They're being held at the same time! I take a look at the teacher's name. Patterson. This guy was the quintessential chaw-munchin football coachin' American bastard when I was in the 10th grade. I think, "He WOULD follow my to college and ruin my life. Just to ruin my life." So I run over to his final, do it very quickly, and then run all the way back across the campus to do my math final as quickly as possible. I remember that I've never been to the class, but I breeze through the material anyway. I hunt around in empty classrooms for mathbooks and dictionaries to steal. Once I've got my backpack loaded up with valuable "study materials", I'm all ready to go. 

All of a sudden, I realize I'm not at college at all but at home, and my parents have arrived with some Africans in tribal gear and colorful robes and neck rings, and are having tea with them. I stay downstairs, just so I don't have to deal with my family. Then, as usual, I have to go to the bathroom really bad, and I keep trying to piss in garbage cans. That doesn't work out too well. As I'm trying to find a garbage can to piss in, some person materializes out of nowhere, comes up to me, and shows me his "closet", which is filled with toys that come to life. To demonstrate, he activates one especially ugly one, and it nearly beats him to death. It gets me a little too, but I escape. (312 words)

David: teenage dreams:#34 (12/28/95)I dreamed that I was in some kind of medieval landscape, laying in the base of a cylindrical tower with my enemy. Guess it was a dungeon. We conversed for a while, very politely and pleasantly, but then, it suddenly came to him that I was after him and after a brief struggle, I leapt out of the dungeon-hole, knowing that he was superior. Everything melted, and the next thing I knew, I was in a supermarket. I see these four painted canvases of cavemen, in the Flintstones leopard-skins that hang on one shoulder, looking very strong, with the legend, "Christian Soldiers Unite!" written across them. Suddenly, all the canvasses of cavemen are lowered, and I see that they're being held up by two bare-chested boys and two bare-chested girls. But, as I get closer, I realize that they are all girls, as one of the older ones takes off her shirt. I find the Christian leader eventually, who's a middle aged man, and I ask him about the girls. He mumbles something, and I beat him up. My friend Bonnie sees this and she tells me that she is very impressed. (192 words)

David: teenage dreams:#35 (12/28/95)I'm walking around downtown in my raincoat and hat, not really knowing what to do. A woman comes up to me and asks me for change, but I remind her that she's already asked me twice today. She groans and takes off to a group across the street. "Wow!" I exclaim to myself, "Amy is over there!" I hadn't seen her since Junior High, so I walk over to her and say hello. She gives me a partial hug and we talk for a while. After a brief conversation, I pretend to be a Mafioso, and I look across the street at all the brand new seventeen story magnificent gleaming coffee places. I hop across the street, and take off my jacket. An old lady walks up, and I whisper something to her in Italian. She nods knowingly, and disappears. I put my coat back on, look around shiftily, and go inside and get an espresso. (156 words)

David: teenage dreams:#36 (12/29/95)I was standing upon a beach with a huge milling crowd of people. I didn't really know what was going on, but it seemed to be some sort of good-natured rock fight. People were picking rocks up and flinging them playfully at each other. They weren't pebbles either, they were ROCKS. Then, everybody started going crazy, and it was like a battle. People were throwing to kill. Talk about a shift. Then a gang called "VS" showed up, and things really got vicious. One girl got me good in the stomach with a big rock and I followed her around, determined to kill her. As it turns out, it was one of my brother's old friends, who he "hates" now. (120 words)

David: teenage dreams:#37 (12/30/95)An abstract dream: I dreamt about patterns, shapes, colors, and lights. (11 words)

David: teenage dreams:#38 (01/01/96)I'm sitting outside with my friends on a massive lawn. We are having a picnic or something. I suddenly realize, as I stand up, that when I press down on the raw earth, I can make sounds. Every time I push down on a place, it forces some air in air pockets out through the grains of dirt, and it makes a farting noise with a note to it, kind of like a tuba. After playing a bit of a song, the earth becomes seriously disturbed, and big rocks and chunks of brick lay everywhere. I guess we had too much fun. Music seems to emanate from beneath these bricks. After we replaced the earth, and I "play" it a few more times only to get the same results, we realize that the underground brick and concrete structure is part of a prison. In fact, the part where they put the most dangerous criminals, and we all struggle in vain to replace the bricks and concrete and dirt before it is too late and the prisoners escape and kill us!! The dreams ends when I jump off the ground and fly away. (192 words)

David: teenage dreams:#39 (01/02/96)The first thing I remember is a dream in which I was eating food out of somebody's hand. Now I'm sitting up in bed. My maternal grandfather appears at the foot of the bed, and asks me "Can you EVER forgive me?" 

I said, "Of course! if you hadn't been such a bastard, I wouldn't have had this life!"

Then he asks, "Is all my money going to end up in ... little pockets?"

I said, "I don't know." Then I apparently woke up, the alarm went off, and I was sitting in the office, kind of sweaty from sleeping in my clothes. It turns out that the alarm was actually the ringing telephone. It's the lunch hour. My supervisor, Ed, (middle aged balding guy with long hair, really greasy and wears glasses, very unclean person.) rushes in, getting things ready. He picks up the phone and begins to deal with the customers, and as usual, another line suddenly lit up, and I had to deal with this person. The person on the telephone was an old lady. An old, deaf lady trying to order some kind of lunch that wasn't on the damn lunch menu. Plus, she was talking too quietly. "I'm sorry, could you repeat yourself?" She muttered again. "I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Could you speak louder please?" She mutters again, and in vain I try to turn up the speaker on the phone. Finally I think "Why am I apologizing? SHE'S the one causing the communication problem!!" "GOD DAMMIT!" I yell. "SPEAK UP! I CAN'T HEAR YOU! CAN'T YOU TALK LOUDER?!" I thought, 'I hope El's put me on the clock for this.'

Finally Carrie, one of the drivers, comes in and gives me this look like, "Stupid customer, huh?" Then I really wake up. (300 words)

David: teenage dreams:#40 (01/03/96)I was scheduled to go to the city with Brad and Jimmy at five or six PM. I was getting ready to go when my brother came in needing help on some stupid class assignment. I helped him for a while, and when I looked at the clock again, it was 8:00pm, and too late to go. I yelled and I screamed and made a fuss. I went to the library, checked out, and read, a book on the various forms of fussmaking. And then my room was getting dark. The hair fell out of my picture of Grieg on the wall. Instead of striking me as odd, this just scared the shit out of me and I "woke up". I sat up in bed, leaned forward, and kind of examined the floor underneath the Greig picture. I turned on the light and everything. After I was finally satisfied that hair had not fallen out of the picture, I had a dream involving the little theater downtown. The theater had just gone out of business and the proprietors had turned it into an antique shop. I thought this was a disgrace. At the very least they could have turned it onto a film museum. (204 words)

David: teenage dreams:#41 (01/08/96)As I recall, it began when I needed to go over to Jimmy's house to do a report. I brought a book that I needed, but it turned out not to be enough, so I went upstairs (in Jimmy's house) to get a new book, setting down the jar of peanut butter I was suddenly, inexplicably holding. Jimmy's house dissolves into my house. Time passes. Night arrives. My parents come home, and we all start talking together. There is a party of some sort going on around us, and we hear a news report that the police are careening off to some crime. We get in our car and start down Green Drive, pausing to let the police pass when they do. Laura's in the car. We decide to follow the cops, and they lead us to the other end of town, where the K-Mart is, and there is a bank there. We walk inside, and a policeman announces. "Well folks, there's at least one dead teller. Of Penn and Teller." Sure enough, some guy is wired to a computer with lots of squiggly wires. But he doesn't look like Teller of Penn and Teller. Amusingly, he looks exactly like Edward Teller, the nuclear physicist. I think, very dramatically, "HOW to STOP this MONSTER?? AAAH YESS! PLAYING MUSIC OVER THE TELEPHONE!" 

I turn to my mother. "QUICK mom! What number combination WAS IT???"

Frantic, she screams, "THREE FIVE O! THREE FIVE O!!"

I run over to the payphone, and dial 350 and random music selections. I look over at the "Teller Machine", and realize with dismay that it is millions of years old. "DIIIIEEEE!!!" it whispers in a gravely voice. I immediately sense my mistake. A sinking terror overcomes me, and I wake up. Gee, I've never been menaced by an ancient physicist before! (304 words)

David: teenage dreams:#42 (01/15/96)Will's parents owned a bookstore. It was a popular hangout spot. I watched a video about the Iran Contra affair. At the end, they took 142 leaders from different countries and hung them twenty at a time from gigantic steel gallows. I thought, and said, "Gee, that's dumb! They didn't hang anybody from the United States!!" My mom overheard this, and we got into another one of those stupid political debates. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#43 (01/16/96)Typical travel dream. I tried to go, kept getting delayed, lost my money, as I was walking along the road I kept tripping over things, etc. etc. (27 words)

David: teenage dreams:#44 (01/21/96)I was listening to jazz, and I thought of the ancient skeleton found in Kenya, supposed to be the oldest human specimen ever found. And I thought, "we are all children of Africa!" Sometimes I have the tritest thoughts in dreams. (41 words)

David: teenage dreams:#45 (02/03/96)I was standing by the window in the living room looking down on the berry bushes, and suddenly acquired binocular telescopic vision. I zoomed into this big black spot I saw, and saw that it was a spider. But not a normal spider, NOOOOOOO. This spider was huge, first off. Maybe a foot across. Second, instead of having a globe shaped abdomen like normal spiders, it had a giant rectangular box. This disgusting thing was almost enough to wake me up. I drifted halfway up out of the dream (long enough to register the spider as a dream) and sank back down into it. Now a bee was crawling around in my right shoe. I was wearing my black boots, and the plastic toe shield had fallen off. I thought to myself, "Well, as long as I don't antagonize the bee, it'll be okay." I talk with my brother for a bit, and soon he asked me why I wasn't worried about the bee. I explained why, but no sooner had I finished, but the bee started stinging me over and over again on my fourth toe. I contracted my foot, to pull he tail off the bee, but I only succeeded in pulling the bee into my shoe. OH NO! Then I woke up. (215 words)

David: teenage dreams:#46 (05/01/96)I was making plans with Jimmy and Will to travel. They had just come back from a trip. I said "You know where'd be a cool place to go?" Everyone responded, "Europe!" So, we built a boat and sailed over. Yup, rolled up our sleeves and built a boat. We landed in some country after sailing the Ocean Blue. I guess it was France, because everybody was speaking French. I walked up to an office building, and hurt the feelings of an attractive woman, with long black hair and large breasts. I don't remember feeling very bad about it. We were standing in a place that looked like San Francisco, and along with all the people doing Tai-Chi, Napoleon was there! Yup, in his uniform. Getting very angry. We tried to change the language of the country so we could understand what was going on, but I did not succeed. For three seconds, I was in 1904 Dublin, standing on a bridge, across the river Liffey, watching a procession of people mentioned in *Ulysses*. Leopold Bloom leaned over to me and said, "Pity, isn't it, that they're all dead? Still, you can't argue with them I suppose." He then tried to sell me something for five pounds sixpence. Then, I was back in "France". The woman with large breasts was standing around trying to seduce Napoleon. We were very glad she was doing that, because Napoleon had gotten extremely annoying. (240 words)

David: teenage dreams:#47 (08/10/96)I was staying in a hotel with Laura and some other people. My family, her family, and a bunch of weirdoes. I was playing with this mechanical grabber thing. The kind you use to pick up repulsive garbage. We were all on the roof of the hotel, and I was playing with things down on the sidewalk with the grabber. It was very long, obviously. Suddenly, quite without meaning to, I picked up a tree and accidentally flung it into the road, where a little baby was standing. I almost killed it. I immediately slumped over onto the railing, not able to believe my stupididty. The mother, or one of the women down below, began to complain about me. She pointed at me and shook her hand and said in a hysterical voice "Well, ARISTOTLE over there just keeps playing in his happy world, he almost kills my baby!" 

I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned around to see Laura, and a tall slightly pudgy girl. Conveniently, at one corner of the roof, there was a large ... bed! So we went over to the bed, and stripped down, and just as we were all going to get into it, Laura said "Ohhh shit!" and pushed the pudgy girl off of her. "What?" we wondered. "My MOM!" Laura said. "I have to buy it for her."

"Can't you buy it later?!"

"NO. I have to buy it NOW. SHIT!" And she sprang up out of bed, got dressed, and ran downstairs.

The next thing I remember is seeing the ground below from an omniscient perspective, and the door that Laura had run through in a rush to buy "it" for her Mom. Another woman, looking like a character from Destinos (a really lame Spanish instruction series, like a soap opera) saw the door open and looked around. Cautiously, she walked in. Somehow, I knew about all this, and to keep her off the roof I locked the door. I don't know why I wanted to keep her off the roof, but apparently it was pretty important. She got out anyway, pushing open a different door that I didn't know about.

She led me inside to a very brownish room, and sat down in a chair. Suddenly "Jean-Paul Sartre" walks in. Only his head is HUGE, way out of proportion to his body, which is spindly and weak looking, and he's about four feet tall. And he doesn't speak French. He speaks English in a very raspy skater's voice. He goes over to the window and lights his pipe. He doesn't say anything philosophical at all in the entire speech he delivers at this point. Basically, this is how it goes. In a very laid back way, he pontificates about drinking beer, eating food, smoking, and fucking, pausing between each sentence to puff pondiferously on his pipe. Then, "Sartre" leads us to the banquet hall. There, everyone is eating food (surprisingly enough). All our families are there. All the waiters speak German ONLY. They're walking around service these pastries on silver hors d'oeuvres platters. These pastries are filled with eel chunks and sugar. I decide to eat one, because, after all, I'M IN PARIS!!!

PARIS. Suddenly, I was away from the hall, and virtually walking through a postcard. As I watched the sun rise over the Seine, "City of the Lost Children"-type carnival music came on in the background, and a cheesy radio announcer's voice came on as I walked through the sights.

"Paris." it intoned. "City of history and dreams. Henry Miller once wrote that 'Paris changes anybody who lives there for more than a year.'" (I had just read this phrase in a book by Ernest Hemingway, so in the dream I kind of laughed and thought, "yeah, they *would* get it wrong!") "On this side of the city, we have the historical city, the Seine." Flash to a picture of the river. "The Academie Francais." Another picture. "The Arc de Triomphe." Click. Then I was suddenly standing below an enormous bridge, which everybody had to cross, was really easy to fall off of, and which if you fell off of it, you'd die. It was constructed of this weird inflated doughy stuff, like high yeast bread dough that's been sitting for a few hours -- really porous and spongy. It had huge 20-story high arches. When you looked up from the base, you couldn't see the top. It was very steep. The colors were alternate stripes of yellow and blue, going all the way up. As I recall, there was supposed to be a flag at the top for those who made it. Remember this was a commuter's bridge, that everyone had to cross!

The voice intoned: "... This insane bridge." Then click to a picture of McDonalds. The voice said "Then, there's the other side of Paris. A dirtier side." Here the voice and music cut off and I was standing at a corner made by two blue walls. Suddenly I noticed an alley, and I started to walk down it, when two tiny little Pomeranians ran around the corner, yipping. One had the word GUARD spray painted in purple on its side. The other was painted with the word DOGS. So these were the GUARD DOGS. I started to walk by them, but they attacked me, and they were far too strong to fight, even though they were Pomeranians. I called out for help, but the painter guy, standing on a ladder and painting the wall, just turned around and laughed. I couldn't figure out whether he was laughing at my cries for help, the fact that I was crying for help from two sub-Chihuahuas, or the words painted on them. (Maybe he laughed because, after all, he's in PARIS!!!) At any rate, by the time the GUARD Pomeranian had eaten half of my leg off, the sensation became too realistic and I woke up. (991 words)

David: teenage dreams:#48 (08/18/96)A man gives his girlfriend a single joint. Somehow, they are caught, and after a long, absurd trial, they are given concurrent sentences, but special sentences. She is sentenced to live in a solitary cell for seven years and he is sentenced to bring her all of her meals. The catch? He can only eat once he's brought her the food, and he can only stay for five minutes. So, three times a day, he's faced with the decision: "should I stuff my face, or should I go hungry this morning and be able to talk to the woman I love?" BLAH!! Creepy dream. (104 words)

David: teenage dreams:#49 (09/16/96)First off, I was a friend of Jack Kerouac. He was trying to kill himself, and I was trying very desperately to keep him from committing suicide while trying to save a huge Glad bag filled with his manuscripts from the certain destruction he had consigned them to by putting them in the closet. Don't ask me the connection; I don't know what closets and certain destruction have to do with each other. Anyway, he succeeded in killing himself. I ended up rescuing only the manuscripts, because I decided he had written quite enough already. (95 words)

David: teenage dreams:#50 (10/19/96)The basic scene is a giant ship kind of setting, but it's still docked. My family and I are living on it, paying for our rooms. The telephone in my mom's car is ringing, and we're on the top floor of the ship, floor four. Jimmy and I try to convince Washington Sanders (a character from a book) to come with us on the "express" elevator but no, he's afraid of elevators. It goes to the second floor, where we have to get off and run across the ship to the other side to get to the bottom. My dad intercepts us and follows us. By now it's too late to get the phone and we just want the message they left. Washington wouldn't say anything but "no. no." and stare off into space. (134 words)

David: teenage dreams:#51 (10/19/96)A haircut. A bad haircut. What I remember here is going to the barbershop and asking for a little off the sides. Bastard gave me a mohawk. I actually kind of liked it but I refused to pay because he didn't respect my wishes. I woke up before anything real happened. (51 words)

David: teenage dreams:#52 (10/21/96)The town was bigger: I don't mean that in terms of more crap in town; but in terms of sheer *size*. Each block was very large. Incredible size. Remember the guy with frizzy hair who used to stand at the corner by parking garage, listening to his headphones and playing air guitar? He walked by, holding a small rectangular piece of paper, like a check, in his hand, whispering "yes! yes!" (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#53 (10/22/96)People had fixed middle names; their first and last names kept changing, but the middle names remained constant. (18 words)

David: teenage dreams:#54 (10/27/96)I was driving my car late at night with Laura. Suddenly I saw an airplane, and noticed that it was dropping a bomb nearby. I began to drive very quickly, frantically telling Laura, who hadn't seen it. I was wondering what it would feel like, would we die instantly, would we be crushed, would our car roll over many times, etc. And while I was imagining all these terrible ways of dying, my instincts were pressing me to drive as far from the place I saw the bomb fall as possible. 

Still, at the same time, a part of me was saying: well, this is it. We're going to die. It's finally come down to it. No escape. It just doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all. (127 words)

David: teenage dreams:#55 (10/28/96)All I remember is a skinhead telling me, "pour le petit dijeuner, j'ai cafi noire et des cigarettes." (For breakfast, I have black coffee and cigarettes.) (26 words)

David: teenage dreams:#56 (10/31/96)I recall a stack of old Dr. Suess books. Great fun. I thought of finding the Lorax and giving it to Laura. (22 words)

David: teenage dreams:#57 (10/31/96)I was fencing with somebody that resembled Jimmy. Only, he had a sword and I didn't. So I pretended to have a sword, which worked pretty well until he noticed. Then a sword appeared in my hand and we really began to fight. We fought for a long time. We were both really getting into it. Finally, he had me at his mercy and we stopped fighting. I thought to myself that sport is the most sublime meditation avaliable to the average individual, to be completely in tune with a healthy body. I thought how much better this was than the time I almost drowned, in shallow water no less. (110 words)

David: teenage dreams:#58 (11/01/96)I was going to the High School, which was located at the junior college. So I get on a skateboard (apparently my only means of transportation) and skateboard to school. I get there in the evening -- there is some kind of athletic event going on. It is fall, and nobody is around, so I skate all the way up to the light on College Drive and "park" my skateboard. I actually parallel park it. Then I step off and think to myself: Anybody could steal it that way! So I put it in my pocket and go down to the track event. I watch a pretty girl running around with the other runners. Apparently this is my girlfriend, and I came down to see her run. Something happens, and I see her being lifted onto people's shoulders. She must have won, I think before waking up. (147 words)

David: teenage dreams:#59 (11/02/96)I was taking a boat to or from India, I don't know which. I need to get my things from my hotel room. Nobody will let me. Finally I sneak past a "stewardess" and look back later to see that she's turned into an elephant. (45 words)

David: teenage dreams:#60 (11/05/96)I remember driving on a country road in winter. We're in the Rockies and it's very dangerous. I almost get hit a few times. I park my car and walk for about four miles until I get to the place where the "concert" is supposed to be. It's this huge snowy field. I go out into the middle and look for Laura. No Laura. Eventually a wall grows up around the sides and the people begin to chant the performer's name. I realize that Rhonda is with me now. She changes into Laura and then Laura changes back into Rhonda. She keeps oscillating this way as they chant. By now there's literally millions of people in the auditorium, and I'm up near the front. Then the announcement: no performance. The people immediately stop chanting and crush out the door. We get trampled. 

Next thing I know, it's morning, and Laura/Rhonda and I are the last ones out the door. We collapse on the ground next to each other, in the snow. There we lay. I have my hand on her thigh and rub it unconsciously. Then I open my eyes and look over, to find that it's neither Laura nor Rhonda but this really tall blonde girl from the junior college. She laughs at me. "I though you said you could tell women apart by the feel of their thighs," she taunts me. "No, I didn't," I reply, and stand up to trek back to the car. The four mile trek was cut out. So was the drive.

Then I'm at the college, talking to people. I talk to Laura about philosophy. She goes to class and I grab a random person. "Wanna go to coffee?" I ask. He -- a big fat guy -- agrees, and we drive downtown to a parking lot where I have to pay 3 cents for parking for the coffee house, 4 cents for the bagel place, and 2 cents for something else, which everybody is at. I go inside the Coffee House and order a coffee at the counter. While she gets my coffee I speak to of the book of Job. The story interests me with its many layers of meaning. My coffee comes, and I order a scone which is sitting right next to me. She tells me it isn't a real scone, but if I'll get her a danish from one of the tables (danishes and muffins are like salt and pepper shakers here: one for each table) she'll get me a scone. So I retrieve a jelly (strawberry) danish for her. She gives me a scone and tells me that "Gary" does that kind of thing all the time. I have no idea what this meant. (457 words)

David: teenage dreams:#61 (11/11/96)One quite vivid image from last night's dream is my own stocky torso and legs with my head totally blown off, blood everywhere. Laura not wanting to see the corpse but ending up holding my hand. Had to identify me, you see. (42 words)

David: teenage dreams:#62 (02/14/97)I was walking through an alleyway, and this guy asks for change. I looked at him, decided he could use some cash and gave him a buck. 

"Thanks," he said. "But what I really wanted, was to show you this funky wall."

He points to my right. Sure enough, it is a pretty funky wall: all bricks, red. Certain door shaped portions stand out from the rest of the wall, with huge leather straps running across them. The bum goes and knocks on one of them.

"Watch," he commands me. Soon, a tall, portly black man with a face like the Mayor's opens the door in a red smoking jacket. He is wearing red silk pyjamas underneath as well; you can see the fabric from his kees down to his feet.

"What the hell you want from me?" he asks the bum. "I don't have no gold pieces in here. No gold pieces. What you want? I told you I don't have no gold pieces in here!"

He shakes his head and slams the door in our face, Q.E.D.

Meantime, Jimmy comes out of a door somewhat to my right. Passing me, he thumbs over his shoulder:

"My sister's right in there."

I go into the hallway, follow it to the end, and see Lisa lying there on the bed, nude, back arched. I walk to the foot of the bed. "I find you very attractive," I say, very matter-of-factly. I put my hand between her legs. "Mind if I express that?" I ask in a scholar's tone. We make love. (261 words)

David: teenage dreams:#63 (03/03/97)I'm walking around. On a sunny, sunny street in Puerto Vallarta. I was standing up against some kind of railing over a Marine-world type pool with lots of clouds floating around in it. Lots of Mario Bros Three type clouds. There was this really neat airplane flying around in the air at high speed and altitudes. It was doing all kinds of crazy loops and spins everywhere. So I ducked into the junior college library (!) and looked at the periodicals. Why these two events are related I don't know. I walked up to the counter and loudly demanded that they provide me with the latest issue of "Playboy". "I am sorry sir. We do not carry Playboy," says the really attractive redheaded librarian that I continually drool over whenever I go in. I am very embarrassed and I sneak out of a hole in the wall. 

Suddenly I'm back, leaning on the railing over the pool. This airplane, which is a World War II-style bomber, starts doing really, really wide angle turns. A giant metal rod zooms out from the motor. A rocket is attached to the end of this rod. As far as I can tell, this is some kind of device to keep it in the air as it does these insane turns.

"Yes!" says the disembodied voice. "It is a stabilizing device!" Suddenly I reflect that nobody is using contractions, and for some reason this creeps me out.

While this stabilizing device is in motion, a man gets out of the airplane (seemingly by sneaking out of a hole in the fuselage) and climbs up on top of the top wing of the biplane. He grabs onto the wing, and stomps on the plane with both feet. Immediately, the plane's motor stops, and both plane and man fall into the pool, making a resounding crash. This crash makes all the Mario Brothers clouds shatter and fall into the water.

The man walks up to me, and soberly informs me: "I have landed my biplane. Follow me."

I follow him as he walks. We pass his "office". I look inside and see a woman, in her thirties or forties, posing for the camera in nothing but panties and a bra. I should clairfy: in nothing but Victoria's Secret-style lacy lingerie. The woman behind the camera sees me looking, warns the woman posing, and, *poof*! She's immediately fully dressed!

The man waves his hand towards a second pool. "This program has been sponsored by Coca-Cola," he says. I look where he points, into the other pool, and I see a pool filled with about five billion cans of coke on ice. The voice of Carl Sagan comes into my head, saying "billions and billions..." I woke myself up with laughing. (462 words)

David: teenage dreams:#64 (05/04/97)This morning I had a dream about Gwen. I was holding in my hand the original draft of my novel, and I was telling her: "See this? I wrote this because of you. This book is about you. You brought this story into my life, and I told it." Then our friend Sarah came along and disappeared. Gwen implored me to come and find Sarah, to get Sarah. (68 words)

David: teenage dreams:#65 (07/08/97)The area by the beach was condemned as a whole, quarantined and evacuated. People went in and cleaned it up. The town begins to resemble Venice. The Pope is coming to make a tour. Somehow I meet the Pope and take him around downtown, I talk to him but he keeps breaking into Ukranian and Greek. He says he's going to go meet the Ali Baba Kiosk guy, "Jimmy", over in the entrance to the city (a long green-walled channel sixteen feet deep) because it reminds him of his "native Macedonia". The Pope has made a four CD set wherein he comments on and talks about our town. In a variety of languages, of course. I, his new friend, am to walk around the newly refurbished beach area selling the CD. All the houses were sparkling blue and white. There was a dance hall by the entrance to the city; Perry's Coffee Shop moved into it because its old building was condemned. We were listening to Middle Eastern music. On the Pope's orders nobody could drink caffeine. Naturally, everybody in Perry's was pissed! So I went down into the beach -- I was smuggling caffeineated coke in. And the way I got it in was by putting it in these huge berry gatorade jars. This is how I met the Pope -- he saw me bringing the "non-caffeinated" drinks into the "ghettoes" (now the best part of town) and decided I was his friend. Before the pope left to meet "Jimmy", he told me I couldn't come, because they would be talking about "highly secret things." But wait -- I didn't speak a word of colloquial Albanian, did I? So I could come along if I liked. It occurred to me that I should run over to the library and learn Albanian real quick so I could hear all the Pope's secret discussions. (313 words)

David: teenage dreams:#66 (07/17/97)I dreamt that Jimmy, Laura, my mother-in-law and I were all going on a camping trip, like the Pinnacles trip I just took with them. Only Jimmy had an orange Volkswagen bus (like my mother-in-law) and he was driving us all. So I packed up. Then, I started reading a biography of somebody. It was just some random person somebody wrote a biography of. It wasn't anybody special, nobody strange, nobody unique or remarkable, or even famous. Just some idiot with a name like John Smith. And they had written this huge fourteen-hundred-plus biography of this totally random person. Yet, it was fascinating. I'd never seen anybody devote so much work to something so completely worthless. The author of this biography said, in the introduction, that he didn't think his book was worth writing. In fact, he thought that it was a total waste of time. The author never justified himself in chronicling every half-second of this guy's life. His source, said the author, was this man's diaries, which he had kept from the age of one day (quite a feat!) until after he died (another feat)! I read it, completely absorbed in the trivialities of this completely trivial person's day to day existence, until I looked up at the clock, and saw that it was four in the morning. 'Shit!' I thought to myself. 'I guess I had better stay up all night.' I began to feel very tired, like I ought to go to sleep, but then I decided against it. I walked around in my kitchen until five or so. Then I went outside and watched the sun rise. Then I woke up. It was around six-thirty, just about when I settled down into 'bed' in my dream to 'go back to sleep'. In my dream, I looked at the clock and said, 'ah! Six thirty. Now I can sleep!' It was so vivid, that when my alarm went off a few minutes later, I actually said 'Shit! Now I'll never get any sleep!' It took a little bit of head-clearing before I realized that I had in fact slept, and that I needed to get up and take a shower. What clued me in was the fact that we weren't going on a camping trip.

David: teenage dreams:#67 (08/09/97)I dreamt that at one point, I had had an older brother named Simon, who died when I was twelve in a motorcycle accident. One of the things that made this dream so wierd was that I had vividly *re-imagined* old family photographs to include this third brother who had never existed. He looked sort of like a cross between myself, Andy and Brent. (64 words)

David: teenage dreams:#68 (08/10/97)I lived on the rooftop of the a building near the beach with Laura. It smelled really bad, just like the waterfront, like piss and saltwater and dead fish. Nonetheless, it was really expensive. To get in, we had to climb this ladder up the side of the building that was made of fresh, untreated pine boards. Each had the legend DO NOT INVENTORY painted on it in green block letters. Laura and I were going to move because it was too expensive. So we were trying to use the phone to get in touch with Jimmy and Kelly, for some reason. But the phone wouldn't work! I climbed down the ladder, found a payphone, and dialed PacBell. I chewed them out: we haven't left yet! Damn you! Now they can call in but we can't call out! Damn it! ARRRGH!! BLAH BLAH BLAH I hung up the phone angrily and looked around. I was in front of some kind of 'Hotel'. But the entryway was kind of a dock. People would sail up, get off their boats, and their boats would be sailed off by valets. I rushed back up the ladder. Some kind of calamity had transpired. All these people were in the apartment, including some firemen, some police, a few young boys, and their father. I was talking to one who was about twelve, and he was complaining that he didn't have anything to read. His father produces a huge tome and drops it on his son's head: "read this," he advised. (255 words)

David: teenage dreams:#69 (09/24/97)We were back in my parents' house: me, Laura, and one of her friends. We were hanging out in my old room; we had brought some stuff in and were preparing to clean it and some other things out. One of these things was a black backpack with a book on 'Black Magic' in it. Inside this book -- rather, on top of it, between the covers -- was a huge mass of yellowish-brown chunky material. I knew this to be 'human remains', and it was somehow associated with the Ku Klux Klan and racist politicians. It was something I had found in the house. 

We all had to take showers before we left because we were all dirty. Laura took hers, and I took mine. I came back into my old room, naked, and saw that Laura's friend was about to touch the 'human remains'. I told her not to do that, and let me tell her the story. And by the way, the shower was free. So I lead her over to my parents' shower and I begin to tell her the story about the human remains, but then I notice that my parents have come back home and are in their bed (which is right by the door to their bedroom). In fact, my mother has sat up and is glaring at me. I realize I'm naked, and immediately I jump into the bathroom and begin looking for a towel to wrap around myself, but they're all too small. After finding two smaller towels, I discover a big one that will wrap around me. I exit the bathroom thus covered, and find that my parents -- rather, my mother -- is about the house causing a ruckus, moaning and crying because Laura and I call elsewhere "home". "Let's go home," I say to Laura. She says: "Wait. I have to train these vines first."

In my old room there is a huge box with these foot long, caterpillar-like things in them. These are the vines. Laura has twisted each one with another, sometimes a smaller one, sometimes not. These are writhing and turning like animals, and swimming around on the surface of the box like bacteria under a microscope. They are bulging out at the ends.

"Look," I say. "They're trying to sprout. Shouldn't you put them in water?"

"Naah," says Laura. "They'll live."

"We should pack up the rest of this stuff," I said.

"Why is there so much, anyway?"

"Remember?" I say. "We thought they'd be coming back tomorrow. We had an extra day."

I start going through the box in the closet. I dispose of the 'human remains' out the window, take the perfectly clean book entitled "Black Magic", I take a few other books, and leave in the closet a few adolescent romance novels. None of the stuff in the box was mine. (480 words)

David: teenage dreams:#70 (10/27/97)I'm downtown, on C. street, standing on the sidewalk. Across the way is the used book store; the parking lot is behind me. Laura walks up with an old friend of hers, Katy. They talk for a while. Earl and Hannah talk for a while. Suddenly I realize that I'm very wet. I'm dripping with water. So I bid my friends farewell and walk down the street. 

All of C street and what used to be the bookstore's parking lot is a huge market. I'm actually on C Street, and all that is being sold on this street are tortillas. Piles and piles of them. Everywhere on the ground are big piles of tortillas with Mexican vendors offering them. The strange thing about this street is that I seem to be the only consumer in the entire tortilla market, and nobody is offering me any. I come to the end of the street and see what looks like a huge, black composting bin. Opposite sides of this bocks have these circular apertures with plastic flaps, like recycling bins. Except it's big enough for a person to go into. Curiously, I inspect the label.

"Drying Machine."

Underneath this was a description of how it worked. It massaged your entire body with towels until it was dry. Then it spit you out the other end. You had to take off your clothes, though, and either rent a locker for them, or just leave them on the sidewalk and hope nobody stole them. If you had a wetsuit, you could leave it on. (!) I noticed a bunch of ads underneath:

"Surfers can't get enough of it! Jews love it! Wet people need it! Try THE DRYING MACHINE (tm) TODAY!!!!!!" I didn't want to leave my clothes on the sidewalk, so I didn't try it. ("Jews love it!"???) (305 words)

David: teenage dreams:#71 (10/27/97)Jimmy is seeing an older woman, fortyish. She has an absolutely *stupendous* body. She sits on the futon for a while as Laura and I talk. The woman is rather domineering. Laura and I were removing plants from the side of the road I used to live on in Green City. Laura was wearing a nearly completely transparent shirt. (59 words)

David: teenage dreams:#72 (12/02/97)I was laying on a bed, staring up at the ceiling. An old, withered voice says: "This is a most exquisite statue of Our Savior, most exquisite indeeEed." 

I sit up and see a very realistic statue of Jesus sitting there in the middle of the room. The voice came from this thin old man with a gray goatee and he's dressed up like the Pope, so I assume he's the pope. The guy actually came from a BBC production of King John, where he played the meddling bishop. I have a computer next to me, and I'm sending email to my friend Dylan. Meanwhile the Pope just begins ranting. I stand up from the bed and turn to see what the Pope is looking at. By golly, it's Thomas Merton. He's dressed up in gardening clothes and looks very jolly, but he seems a trifle hurt by the Pope's words, whatever they were. With very dirty hands, he spreads a variety of squashes, zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, etc. "From my garden," he explains. He's wearing a straw hat and overalls. (180 words)

David: teenage dreams:#73 (01/07/98)Will and Bryan are telling us in horrid and grotesque detail of a riot they witnessed. Will in particular tells me about a body he saw which was slashed from the tailbone to the base of his neck. He tells me about it and I visualize it in all its bloody hideousness. It is so revolting I wake the hell up. (61 words)

David: teenage dreams:#74 (01/08/98)A party. At somebody's expensive looking house. It is connected in some way with poetry. Jennifer is there, making the party go round. I realize somehow, when everyone has gone home, that Laura is asleep in the next room. The heating element on the stove, the coil part, begins to burn like a fuse, and I know that if I let it burn to the center ("the transistor", I call it in my dream) it will explode and kill us. I try to drag Laura out of the house, frantically pulling and shouting at her to wake up. I wake up, instead. (102 words)

David: teenage dreams:#75 (01/09/98)I was standing before three large spaghetti sauce jars, all of which seemed crusty and old. Just as well, because two of them contained spiders. The jars were stacked vertically. The middle one had the most spiders -- seven or eight little brown things with mre or less spherical abdomens. The jar was also filled with little green strings. Each of these strings had a ball at the end. They had emanated from the spiders somehow. The lower jar had only two or three spiders in it, and these were more common-looking: largish legs, small, flat bodies. All of a sudden I notice I'm holding a book. I look down and open it to the proper page. I read: "The spiders in the middle jar are offensive little things. They're not good for anything, and they emanate a little green thread that many people wonder at. Do not be decieved! These little green threads are solid farts! Many times in my presence small unruly children have lit them on fire for a joke. I much prefer the spiders in the lower jar. They are not so offensive and, what's more, they make great tahini sauce!" Repulsed by the idea of making anything to eat out of a spider, I shut the book. (212 words)

David: teenage dreams:#76 (01/11/98)The doorbell rang (!) and I looked outside on the steps. There was a package there. "Ooo!" I think. "My Stephen Hawking book!" I pick the package up and bring it inside to the kitchen. I remember some aria from Il Trovatore was playing. Laura's working next to me in the kitchen. I open the package: inside are four stacks of County Transit bus schedules. Along with three maps: one of a nearby city, one of San Francisco, and a geological/topographical map of the world. "Odd," I said. "I only sent away for one schedule." (95 words)

David: teenage dreams:#77 (01/15/98)I was walking through a "Museum of Human Anatomy" with a number of other people. We come soon to the skull display. There is one skull in full light, and another one beside it, indirectly lit, so it is mainly in the darkness. This skull has skin stretched over it, dead, straw-like hair, and eyeballs. The lips seem to be cut off. It doesn't look like he died a very pleasant death. Most of this is pretty well hidden by the obscure lighting, however. So we're walking along, and this idiot hippie guy bumps into the case, knocking the hideous head out into the full light. Everybody is very disgusted and turns away. The hippie guy says: "Whoa... sick." It wakes me up. (123 words)

David: teenage dreams:#78 (01/15/98)I'm in Patrick's "hovel". Patrick has built a bizzare little house for himself among the roots of a huge oak tree. It's one main room and a couple of side rooms. Patrick has died, and in his will he left me my old Apple II+! I turn the computer on and begin poking with the files "on it", as if it had a hard drive. (65 words)

David: teenage dreams:#79 (01/15/98)My family is staying in this really fancy hotel in the middle of a huge city. They offered to let me stay there for free, so of course I agreed to come along. I can't remember much of the "plot", such as it was, but I remember a few details: The main stairwell was blocked at both ends by this wierd fence thing, presumably to keep infants off the stairs. It was beyond me, though, so it succeeded in keeping me off the stairs as well until somebody showed me how to climb under it. As I got up the stairs, though, I found my way blocked by a net thing that folded over three steps. I picked it up and played with it a bit. Suddenly I noticed the crown at my feet. Of course! It's a tiara! The best way to get from room to room (if you were sure of your footing) was by climbing from porch to porch. Once I climbed into the wrong people's room and created much havoc. I was in my room at one point, thinking of taking a shower. I got a phone call from some woman. "Hi David," she says, and goes on talking like she knows me real well. I have no idea who it is. "Tell ya what," I say. "How about I meet you in the lobby down there in half an hour? I'll be reading a book." 

"Okay," she says.

I then see that the room I'm in has no shower. We say goodbye and hang up. I walk down to the lobby and accost somebody. "I need to take a shower!" I say. He points me down the street, a huge, busy city street, to where the showers are. I thank him and skip off to take my shower. (303 words)

David: teenage dreams:#80 (01/20/98)We had the corpses of Saul Bellow and "Nathan Zuckerman" (Philip Roth) in caskets in our apartment. They were dead and we were to bury them the following day. Roth had a cheap casket, made of paperboard, and Bellow had a fine ebony one. I was to deliver the eulogies. Laura and I decided to put them outside because they were beginning to stink. Only problem was, it was raining. We stacked them on the porch, Bellow (who was tall) on the bottom and Roth (who'd been short) on the top, and covered them with a blue blanket to protect them from rain. The subjects of the eulogies were to be "Seize the Day" and "The Ghost Writer". I was rereading both of them late at night to think of something to say. We were laying in bed. This is when Laura noticed the corpses were stinking. We then moved Bellow off the kitchen table with his dark black wooden casket and Roth with his blue paperboard ex-musical instrument case (with metal reinforced corners) off the stool, and moved them out. Then we laid our own blankets back out. I thought I spied a spider in the blankets, but on inspection, it turned out to be some orange lint. I menioned to Laura: "Roth must have been really fucking cheap. I'll bet he wouldn't pay a dollar fifty for coffee." There was something earlier involving buses, but I no longer recall. (241 words)

David: teenage dreams:#81 (01/21/98)Laura, Jimmy and I were in Germany. Jimmy and I were in a bookstore which was underground. All the people spoke in these wierd voices that sounded amplified, tinny, and distorted. Naturally they were saying things in German. I remember one large man saying to another: "Bitte! Ich moechte mich unterhalten!" (Please! I'd like to enjoy myself!) At one point Laura came flying down the stairs with three ostriches. She was riding one of them. "I got these for twelve bucks!" she said. "No, you didn't!" Jimmy corrected her, examining the price tags. "You paid twelve pounds each! That's like 90 dollars!" We all got on the ostriches and blasted down the stairs through the bookstore, startling all the Bavarians. Suddenly we were in a river, an underground river. At one point I recall floating a fat person around on the water. We eventually got washed to Vienna. So now we're in a hotel in Vienna. A fat man and his wife, the same fat man we'd been floating in the river, tells us they're looking for their daughter, and shows us a picture of her. (186 words)

David: teenage dreams:#82 (01/24/98)I was getting on a bus at the Green City Denny's. This was a bus that drove up Green Drive, turned around, and drove back. Tim was on the bus. I hated him for years because I believed he stole my girlfriend, and all that hate came back in this dream. (51 words)

David: teenage dreams:#83 (01/25/98)I was naked. So was Laura. I was re-stringing an unvarnished electric bass, so I guess it was naked, too. At one point I put a screw in to secure a string, but then realized I wasn't holding the bass but Laura, and I had attempted to affix the string to her cunt. She seemed to like it, though, so I kept turning the screw. (65 words)

David: teenage dreams:#84 (01/31/98)I am a Chinese man, and I'm going to marry a wealthy man's daughter. This makes me the inheritor of this man's fortune. In order to claim my right both to the daughter and the fortune, however, I must kill her younger brother. He's now jealous because the fortune would have gone to him. So I end by shooting him through the head with crossbow bolts, literally pinning him to the wall. (72 words)

David: teenage dreams:#85 (02/01/98)First of all, I'm in a bookstore, and I see that Tim Eagan has brought out a new collection of Subconscious Stuff. Or so it seems. I look again and see that it's actually a four-volume set -- two diaries, a sketchbook, and a little book of his philosophy. Since I like his comics I buy these books. We're going to a brunch with my family. I need to use the bathroom, so I tell my parents this, and I use their bathroom to take a crap. I read the first entry -- it's a very serious entry all about a 'new direction' in his life. However, he ends the entry with: "Oh well. I'm not as excited as when I first brought these notebooks into the can." The books are hardbound, but they're printed on newsprint. At the beginning is a "picture of Tim Eagan". He looks like an evangelist. A fat laughing guy in a tacky dark-colored suit is next to him in the photo. In the sketchbook, in the very beginning, there is a strange drawing entitled 'me'. This, I supposed, was his cartoon self-portrait. While I'm cleaning up, I hear my mother complaining to my father: "I wish you'd throw them away. I just don't like it when Nick has access to all these pictures of naked women! You never did outgrow dirty pictures..." Sarcastically I mutter something about mothers and I leave the bathroom. I ask if everyone's ready. "David," he says. "the brunch isn't until 1:30 or so." "Wow," says I. "that's a long time." I go into the living room. My dad follows. On the machine are several angry phone calls from Sonja. She calls again and I hear my dad's side of the conversation. She's coming soon, I gather. Eventually she arrives. She looks haggard and disheveled. "I haven't slept for 25 hours," she says. 

We go have brunch. It's some kind of big to-do. Tim Eagan is there. I recognize him by his self-portrait. The photo was completely wrong. I tell him I liked his new books. He thanks me. I give a little speech and sing a song, with a music stand for a podium. Everybody compliments me on these -- but everyone seems to feel a need to denigrate the music stand. "Sigh," I think. "It's always something." One such person was a thirtyish, long-haired type. Almost everyone I recognize in town was at this thing -- Jeff G., people from cafes. I go outside for some fresh air, and immediately run into a couple of "professional bums". " 'Ello, Guv'ner!" one says in his cockney. I recognize them and greet them by name, but I can't remember what I called them. I dug in my pockets and gave them all but my quarters -- all my change but those twelve cents. One of them calls my father a 'skinflint'. This last part's unclear. I've gotten a bus pass, an 'All' bus pass, orange, with a big 'A' on it. It's good anywhere, anytime, for any ride, "except route 40". I'm climbing around on some rocks outside the building the 'brunch' was in (incidentally, it's dark as night out), and I'm trying not to smash a big grey spider named 'Max'. (542 words)

David: teenage dreams:#86 (02/05/98)I'm in the desert, having a conversation with a couple of German people. The conversation is moving along smoothly, until I can't remember the word for 'battery'. "Ist es 'batt-err-ee'?" I ask. I get laughter. I hem and haw for a while. "Ich weiss dass!" I turn to one of them. "Wie sagt man "battery" auf Deutsch?" 

One of them, a young exchange student looking type, smiles and says: "Wir werden Sie drei Tagen verlassen. Wenn Sie sich erinnern nicht, wir sagen werden." (We'll give you three days. If you can't remember then, we'll tell you." And they disappear, leaving me to trek back through the desert to my 'home'. They drive off in a jeep.

By the time I get home, it is nighttime, and something has happened to the rest of humanity. Laura shows me a large circular map. "My mother just went out there and mapped the whole city. She didn't find anyone. They're all gone."

Indeed, I look at the map and see rows of individual houses, each marked with a little 'e' for 'empty'. "She checked all those places?" I ask.

"Well, it's like the Census," Laura said. "She checked a certain number and then extrapolated the data." Laura plays with a protractor and compass on the map for a while. She talks again: "At any rate, everyone's gone, whatever it means."

"If there's a God," I joke, "he probably wiped out the rest of humanity because they suck, and He wanted to start over from us. Like Noah."

Laura laughs. "But doesn't it say, in the Bible, that God said he wouldn't do that again, ever?"

"Laura, I was joking. It's a myth. Whatever happened, they probably just missed us."

Laura looks out the door. "Oh man," she laments. "Here comes another one! Can I have a pair of scissors, something sharp?"

I hand her the nearest pair. "This one has a little glue on it. Is that okay? Can you use it?"

"I'd rather not." She really doesn't want to. "It might get stuck, and then it wouldn't deflate."

"What wouldn't?"

"Oh, these damn inflatable babies!"

I grab a pitchfork and walk to the door. Sure enough, a malicious looking plastic inflatable baby, with little drawn on dots for eyes, is crawling towards the door. I should add that it was about six feet long and two or three feet high at the shoulder. It obviously means harm. "When you stab it," Laura advises, "try to leave the pitchfork in while still letting out the air. Otherwise they blow all over the place like a balloon." I stab the baby several times as it enters the house. As the baby deflates, it turns into a shrivelled-up, forlorn-looking plastic garbage bag. "How many of these have you killed?" I ask.

"Oh, two or three."

We walk outside. It's still nighttime out and there's a wierd glow to everything. I hear a voice and direct my attention to it. After a while we discover the source. The tall, blonde library page whose legs I once dreamt about feeling is sitting on top of some huge twenty gallon drums, nude, and some nondescript man is industriously making love to her. She keeps making cute little noises and thanking him.

I point to them and turn to Laura. "Under these circumstances, probably the best idea," I say. Then, after a short pause: "It's 'die Batterie', I'm sure of it. They were just fucking with me."

"David!" Laura says. "Get over it! Does it really matter right now?" I laugh, conceding the point. (595 words)

David: teenage dreams:#87 (02/08/98)So! I'm working at the Hillside Library, with Will. But today, even though it's insanely busy, he's not helping out at all. He's on the phone, talking with his boyfriend Bryan, who currently lives in Boulder or Denver. Right then Will walks out, and I pick up the phone to see what they're talking about. I say "Hello? Hello?" but they completely ignore me: in the background, quietly, they're talking about stocks. Finally one of them addresses me directly, and says: "You know, there's some kind of SubGenius thing going on in town tomorrow..." 

I set down the phone in order to help a patron. This patron begins to talk about a book that he just read, telling me all about it, in the long winded way a patron will sometimes do when there's a thousand people in line. As I listen to him tell the story, I enter into it myself: I see my father standing at the telephone in the kitchen at their house, and he speaks in a voice-over:

"My father, your grandfather, is in his last days. He never called much before. But the last two days he called me at SEVEN in the morning to talk about his grave and burial with me..."

Now I see my grandfather, Bob, smoking a pipe and standing outside a huge grey building. (Yes, my grandfather really IS named Bob, and he really DOES smoke a pipe.) His voice starts in:

His voice sounds like William S. Burroughs. "One day I came to work at the silk factory... Jones is dead!" We see him, shocked at learning the news. "Came in the next day... Wilkinson is dead!" We see him learning the news from a secretary, fear growing. "Next day another one had died; the following day, another!" He's in front of the silk factory again: "I know that I'm next."

The next part is somewhat confused, but somehow, my grandfather has already died and his ghost is now chasing me around the front of the silk factory. He wants to freeze me to death with snow. As I run down a path around the factory, I think the following 'profound' thought: "He's got nothing on me, because if I beat him, I live; if I die, I'm dead." He corners me in a large chicken coop, but somehow, I knew we had 'agreed' to meet there in some secret way. But there's already somebody there: a tall, thin, dark-haired woman in a skimpy, red, white and blue one-piece swimsuit. This woman I recognize as one of the models in a stretching book Laura and I had been using through January. She's going to help me against my grandfather's ghost. Grandfather Bob very tersely says to her: "Get out of the coop. Now." And snow begins to blizzard around him.

At this point the story dissolves and I'm back in the library again, talking to the patron. I tell him: "Thanks anyway, but I hate fiction like that." Will, in the meantime, has come back from his break. He tells me: "Hey! I won a million dollars on the stock market!" He hands me the phone. Bryan is repeating in a monotone voice: ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILL... ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILL...

I tell Will, "God, Will, it's busy today. Can't you help out a little instead of talking to Bryan?" As I wake up I think that if the ghost killed me that I at least knew there was an afterlife because a ghost killed me. (589 words)

David: teenage dreams:#88 (02/17/98)I'm standing in a church. Dozens of clones of Matt (a friend) are being gunned down in cold blood by machine gun fire. I hide under a pew when the gunfire starts. I see the clones' heads being blown off, etc. Somehow I knew that the situation outside was really crappy, and that even if I did make it out alive, living would be a highly questionable alternative to dying. Whatever the situation was, it was probably better to be dead than to be crawling around half-dead, running for my life. Besides, I figured, there were two other things about dying: First of all, if I got myself killed just then, and death turned out to be nothing, then great. At least I wouldn't be in agony; at least the torturers couldn't get me too. Second, if death turned out any other way, than equally great, because then I'd be out of this crappy situation and in some other state of affairs. On this thought, I stood up and had my body ripped through by machine-gun fire. After I died, I found myself in a room with two beautiful, naked women, one brunette, one blonde. And Matt. I have sex with the blonde woman for a while, and then we stop to invite the brunette. She can't. She points over at a hallway. She explains that she needs to go get her womb, or her ovaries, or her 'placenta' -- I remember it was some part of the reproductive system, or the placenta; I don't know whether this latter was supposed to be her own or her baby's -- but every time she goes into the hallway, Matt shoots her to death and she has to start all over again. So she never goes to get 'it', and she never joins me and the blonde. (305 words)

David: teenage dreams:#89 (02/20/98)It happened like this. Laura and I were walking through an old, deserted street -- at least, I thought it was a street. There were rows of concrete stairs going up to wooden doors with white paint flaking off of them, as though they hadn't been repainted for years. I look around on the ground and see that it is completely covered with rotting vegetation -- old dead leaves, mushrooms, dirt, etc... forest debris, in other words. This old street had been deserted and nature was taking over. 

"Neat road," I say. "Not a road," says Laura. "An ancient mansion." She points up, and I look. Sure enough, there was the framework of a long-since rotted out roof up there. So we were in an entrance hall. We both have to use the bathroom. So we go into a door Laura knows and find a toilet. A little man is waiting in the bathroom. Laura can use the regular toilet, he explains, and since I have to go so bad, there's a special toilet that I can use right -- here! He opens a small panel near the bottom of the wall. The way it works is, I climb into this small chamber, and squat with one leg out, leaning my back against the framework. This way I can piss and shit at the same time with no mess. The man then begins to talk to me about Balzac. As I leave the bathroom, I hear a narrator say that this was the ancestral home of Aureliano Buendia (from One Hundred Years of Solitude) where he and his friends partied all night in "all the lustiness of youth". (278 words)

David: teenage dreams:#90 (02/21/98)I am sitting at a 4-partition desk like they have got at the junior college library, intended for studying. I'm sitting in front of a large window of some sort, at this desk, 'working on my style'. Laura and I have dinner there and she leaves. I get frustrated with the stupid blue desk lamp -- it keeps flickering on and off -- and so I throw it out the window. I turn on the computer and hook it up to the window (which I'm using as a movie screen) to watch an animated movie, which is done all in blue tints. I put the movie in because the box said it was "Heartwarming". But -- a hick cop on the street shines his light in. Apparently I'm violating some sort of law by watching a blue film. I must stop. Not wanting to stop, I simply pull the shades. Now on the screen I get a Windows error box. It says: "Stop. 3 Minutes." I stop the movie and wait. Another message: "Revert To Wood. Now." Everything goes black. I wake, inexplicably scared. (184 words)

David: teenage dreams:#91 (02/23/98)Crazy dream. To begin with, I'm working in the apartment. It's filthy and disgusting, and Carol from the library is helping me to clean it. I inspect the carpet and see that it's more dirt than carpet: the dirt is so thick that oxalis is flourishing, blooming like crazy, right in the middle of the room. Laura comes home, and she helps in the cleaning too. After a while we get hungry and want to leave for a restaurant. But Jimmy and I are laying on the floor talking! We're discussing 'principles'. I told him that ignoring principles altogether will soon bring him misery enough. I had just read this, in waking life, in a book by Bertrand Russell. What I thought Russell meant was that abstract ethical principles are derived from concrete experience: it has been shown that if you kill somebody his brother will be very angry with you and his brother will try to kill you. Today the surrogate big brother, the judicial system, will get its revenge. Thus you should follow the principle of not killing other people. Less extreme, if you eat too much cake, you'll get sick. You are ignoring the principle of moderation in eating. I was trying to get this across, but naturally, failed, because I had just read it and the meaning had not quite sunk in. What interrupted our conversation was a middle-aged asshole reading a Bill Cosby book. He shook his head very disapprovingly and disagrees with everything we say, it seems, on principle. Laura knows him; she hates him. She cleaned his house once: he performed medical experiments on humans. Apparently the guy was trying to say Well I ignore principles and I'm perfectly happy so nyeah! Heh. 

Now Laura and I are in a highschool classroom. We hide in a nook around the corner of the room and make out. We've stepped into a diorama of the bay on the floor. Nearby is an aquarium filled with all kinds of wierd animals, including a strange turtle, tiny, with all kinds of squarish spikes jutting out from its shell. The "aquarium" I referred to was a lot like the tidepool exhibits in the Aquarium. The owner of the diorama appears and points out the turtles. "They don't look like much, but they sure wreaked havoc on this part here--" he points down at a corner of the diorama-- "only you can't see it, because Bill fixed it too quick for me to show you properly..."

Now we're in the restaurant. Laura goes inside to get a table. Abruptly I decide I don't want to eat at a restaurant, and so I start walking home. I hitchhike: a blonde college girl gives me a ride. I thank her and get out of the car at the base of a wooden footbridge. In the background, Einsturzende Neubauten is playing. I begin to walk across the bridge and pass a skater kid. "Bitte," I say. "I mean, excuse me." The kid scowls, not appreciating my 'slip' into German. Laura meets me on the other side of the bridge. I tell her I was going to call her when I got home. We walk back across. On the other side I say "I got a ride from her--", pointing at the blonde girl, who is sitting on the lap of another girl. This girl is squeezing the blonde girl's breasts. There is a large plastic bag filled with the bagel place's Tomato Herb Bagels at her feet.

Then Laura and I walk into a hospital. We're getting flu shots. I answer a couple questions and they shove a hypo between my fingers: no pain. I joke with the very unimpressed, fat nurse that "I hate that 'full vein' feeling." Next to me is a black Caribbean man, twitching and looking generally ill. He recieves his shot and twitches away. Jimmy (who's suddenly with us again) asks the nurse something, and she begins to explain how Alex got his stomach lining surgically removed. Before she can finish, however, she is interrupted to serve up some peach pie to us patients. She uses the hypo syringe to do this. I thought to myself: "Gee, I hope she sterilized that before using it." The thought of that needle having been unsterilized (especially since it had been in the hand of that *very* infected-looking man) nearly makes me stop eating the pie, but then I figure, Hey, it's a hospital. *Everything* gets sterilized here. I wake. (750 words)

David: teenage dreams:#92 (03/11/98)I dreamt that I was standing outside a cafe when Jeff tapped me on the shoulder. "Oh, hello!" I said. "How've you been?" He responds in a typical fashion, sort of nervously, looking around at everything but me, squinting into the distance, looking obliquely at me to check my reactions, alluding to private events as though they were common knowledge. Sharp guy, but annoying to talk to. "Oh, I just moved in here, you know. Mary and I, we got back together." 

"I didn't know you were back together."

"Yeah, well. That was a pretty big thing, you know..." It turns out we're now living in the same house. I have the upstairs apartment. We open a trapdoor and find a wierd plastic sheet with lots of white plastic spiders on it. There's a few real ones; Jeff flicks those off, saying: "Oh, these are the fake spiders. You don't want the real ones there, you know." He helps me through the trapdoor into the attic room. (167 words)

David: teenage dreams:#93 (03/11/98)I was walking down one aisle of the metro station, in an entourage containing all my friends. We are, at the moment, Very Unhappy -- everybody is quite depressed, and Andy is weeping furiously. Mr. Burns, the friendly deaf old geezer who comes into the Hillside library all the time is guiding people to the funeral. He hits me in a friendly way with his rolled up newspaper in order to get me on the right track: you see, I'm leading the procession. Soon we came to the funeral. It's in the parking lot next to the bus station. This is Melanie's funeral. There is a huge Days of the Dead-style altar erected in the middle of the lot, complete with an enormous black and white photo of Melanie, with flowers ringing all around it and lots of burning candles and papier-mache skeletons and so on. A mariachi dirge is playing in the background. (154 words)

David: teenage dreams:#94 (03/14/98)I dream I'm watching an Australian film named: "The Death That Taught The Citie". Yes, it was spelled that way; "Citie" was "City". I guess that was supposed to be the Australian spelling. Anyway, the movie was about a backwater in the Australian wilderness, about two groups -- an aboriginal tribe and a white tribe. The whole story revolved around this one boy of twelve or thirteen, who had committed some horrible transgression against the (white) tribal law (it was a white boy), and was therefore being made to shoot himself in the face. The aboriginies highly disapproved -- it was 'uncivilized', according to them. They didn't understand the law. And the movie was all about this debate, and all the politics surrounding this punishment: would he be forced to, or not? In the end, it seems, he did kill himself, as custom demanded, but the message of the film was ambiguous. I found the story very interesting, but I guess that's somewhat self-serving, since I directed the film myself. (170 words)

David: teenage dreams:#95 (03/13/98)Jimmy and I were in a park, arguing over the meaning of the word 'go'. We each thought the other was completely full of shit and spent a lot of time arguing about it -- a good natured battle. (39 words)

David: teenage dreams:#96 (03/16/98)I'm exploring an ancient tomb with a friend. We'll call him Bob. This tomb is supposed to be quite ancient and archaelogically important: these are the bones and the dirt of people talked about in the Bible. It's supposed to be an old tomb, but it really resembles the dried-out dusty area under cellarless houses. In the very center we find a set of steel lockers. These lockers contain ancient books. At this point I have a typical thought: "While I'm down here, I might as well get a book." I open the lockers and riffle through them. Bob looks inside the lockers too, but there's nothing he wants. Then, of all people, a Hillside library patron whom I know walks in. He is an Indian man with some very interesting experiences described in the note below. Alan strides in, and says: "Too bad about the rats mon. With the dead people." I look on the ground and there are all these disgusting little bright red rats. Instead of noses there are long red needles. I think he meant it was too bad because of the important corpses to be found there. Later, I'm in the doctor's office because a very unusual event is occurring. Unusual -- for me, a male. I'm menstruating. To cheer me up, Laura quotes from a book about how much parents suck. (227 words)

David: teenage dreams:#97 (03/23/98)I was in some kind of warehouse, some huge hardware store, preparing for a trip with a lot of other people. I keep seeing all kinds of people from the Middle School, and I get fond farewells from Jasmine and Amanda in particular. I go into my trailer, feeling touched, and I find Jimmy there. He's toying with my computer -- he's added a soundcard and speakers. I try to play a game but the sound effects just slow the computer down so much it's useless. After talking with some of the people who'll be taking the trip with me, I realize I'll need two double-A batteries for the device in my hand. I try different batteries that are laying around; no luck. So I go back into the hardware store. I find a large backroom with lots of batteries. But, I've got to take a leak, so I stand in front of a urinal and decide to piss on the orange wall above the urinal next to me. Halfway through my piss I hear a stall door open and I turn back to the urinal. Bob, who used to work at the Music Center, comes up next to me. "Real cute," he sneers. "People have to clean that up, you know." He turns and leaves the bathroom, muttering 'Pissing on the walls...' I leave the bathroom when I'm done and find him and a few other guys sitting around a table, eating. "Is this where I find the batteries?" One guy points and says: "Over that way, see?" I see, and I go where he points, but on the way I'm distracted by a large table with all kinds of stuff on it. The item which really catches my attention is a huge magnifying glass. I magnify various things on the table and consider buying it, for fun, but then I see it will cost $56.74. I think of a picture I once saw of James Joyce holding a magnifying glass. I set down the glass and wake up. (340 words)

David: teenage dreams:#98 (03/25/98)Fragments. 

I'm sitting at a bus stop with my parents, trying to figure out the schedule. Somehow it has something to do with grammar, and I'm trying to explain word stems, infinitives, gerunds and so on. Finally my bus comes.

Jimmy is playing a video game, except it's real. It involves a skull with a fused jaw but no mouth hole, real eyeballs, and a big hole in the back. When you look inside the hole you see all kinds of putrefaction. Whenever you make it talk a hole opens up in the jaw. Whenever a squeaky sound effect is required, a very deep voice has been dubbed in to say: 'squeak squeak'

We're in the library with Matt M., another employee I saw yesterday. Laura tells me I ought to check out a book for him, that "really funny Mark Twain book". I check out a copy of The Innocents Abroad but when I come back they've gone away. (160 words)

David: teenage dreams:#99 (03/26/98)I'm standing by a large swimming pool. There are dozens of naked young women swimming in it, hanging around the sides, etc. But all are skinny-dipping. It turns out it's not just girls, because this is an experimental school run by a guy that looks like George Carlin. He says he didn't tell them to do anything: he just provided the pool and most of them (not all) just swam without clothes. After a confused part, most of the people are gone, and now I'm hanging around the pool with Andy, Melanie, the mousy blonde girl from Hillside Market, and a few other people. The women and a couple guys are now swimming around au naturel. Something happens regarding the house nearby; at any rate, it's time for people to sleep. Everybody got sleep but me, because while I'm sleeping, this hick guy and his dogs (everyone knows him) comes along and needs a place to stay. But actually this paragraph isn't right: I don't remember why I don't sleep. At the end, everybody is hanging out, discussing this problem in the main room, and I mention to Jimmy the fact I got no sleep. He says something cryptic: "Well, at least you got the *Calypso*!" and raises his eyebrows, looks around conspiratorially, and rubs his hands. Apparently he's referring to the nude girls. I'm not amused. I think, I could have done without the naked girls; I needed sleep. I could have *dreamed* them. I particularly remember having this last thought. Another fragment of this dream I cannot place, besides the hick guy and his dogs, is this: the experimental school got shut down. Naked people were too much for the authorities, it seems. (285 words)

David: teenage dreams:#100 (03/28/98)I'm testing my driving skills in the Buick with Laura at night. To see if I can be a bus driver. I dial 481-TIME to learn about the job. I drive very badly, nearly running into things. I park downtown and put things in my backpack in the car. Laura's with me. She digs through the change purse; she's going to get a treat. We walk around downtown (deserted) in the dark like that; it begins to rain. I show Laura how I wear my flannel over my backpack to protect it from rain. Now I'm in a class of some sort, with Mr. W, or somebody like him. The firebell rings and we all run outside. I pause a few minutes to select the writing tablet with the most paper to bring with me. Outside, the teacher gives a lecture on how to prepare the minimum writing supplies for use in fires and earthquakes. I don't listen to him. I think he's a fucker. Back downtown where I left off with Laura, I put my backpack in the back seat of the Buick as it starts to rain harder, and get in the driver's seat. I pull out onto West street and nearly hit a car in front of me; I swerve and go through the intersection. I can't find the brake fast enough to stop before the intersection at Main, so I glide through, find the brake, and pull the car to a halt at the left turn signal. Laura says: "God, David, you need practice." 

It is still downtown, still night, still raining. Laura is standing outside a building of some sort. It looks like a large rectangular metal vault set on concrete. I think it was supposed to be a bank. Laura might be naked, I'm not sure, but she's definitely shirtless. She has her arms crossed under her breasts, squeezing them up. They look very full and uncomfortable for her. She's waiting for me. All through this I keep thinking of J.B. Priestly. The name and the effect of his book I just read [Man and Time] hang in the background of everything, coloring every action but not changing them. It's hard to describe. I later dreamed of a Monty Python-looking guy in Elizabethan dress who announced that they're taking the POMP out of pompousness, leaving nothing but ousness. (391 words)

David: teenage dreams:#101 (03/29/98)My dad, a big fat Latin American, wants me and Laura to help him slaughter the hog he brought home for Christmas. He leads us out into a hallway with a brand new white carpet and pulls the huge, strangely docile animal out from under a shelf, holding it out. After a brief little argument over what cuts of meat we'll each get, "dad" asks me to please turn the head while he cuts the hog's throat. I do so, and as "dad" pulls the knife through the hog's throat he shouts and falls back. Naturally the place is now awash in blood. He seems surprised, but I think, What did he expect? So it now falls to me to spray the stain remover on all the blood in the house, even in the attic. I spray this noxious stuff everywhere and it poisons me half to death. I go up in the attic and spray out stains which are blood, again, and look uncomfortably like the scene of the biker's accident at L St. and M St. last week, after the cops had sprayed and labelled all the evidence. Only the stains are in miniature. Only then do I realize I've stumbled into a tangled web, a web spun by three spiders with voices. These, it seems, are Henry Miller's wives (I just finished Jay Martin's biography of Miller), and they have spun an intricate system of webs and strands to complicate each others' lives. Naturally I've stumbled through and destroyed the whole thing. I hear the voice of one of his "wives" say: 'Everything you've said about him and about us is no closer to the truth than anything else anyone has said. You can't say anything true about another human being, you just can't. In order to say anything true about him at all you would need to expand until you *became* Henry yourself..." I look down at the three wives of Henry Miller, now spiders, staking out their territories, fencing one another in, repairing the damage I did. I begin to levitate, and expand, floating on my back, until I *am* Henry Miller, himself... I wake in the exact same position I was levitating in. (369 words)

David: teenage dreams:#102 (03/29/98)It's a gift shop or a toy store or something. I'm walking around in it with my mother -- we're buying gifts for someone. But -- it's more like a party than a gift store, and people are hanging out all over the place. I see Sarah (old lust from Middle School) sitting in the corner, and this really trips me out. I walk over to say hello. She says hello back. I tell her this is really wierd, because I'd just been dreaming about her. As I talk to Sarah and all these other past acquaintances I lose track of my mother. Well, good, I think, and latch onto a group of friends. Sarah tells me she's going to a party, will I come along? Well, even though it's the middle of Los Angeles and I don't know what hotel my parents are staying in, I say okay, because I want an adventure, not another damn number of days ruined by my family. So I go with Sarah to this party in an apartment building. I keep hearing this jazz music. We go into the room and it's Thelonius Monk playing the piano! He's got a lunatic eight or nine-string upright bass, and he's trying to play with this amateur bassist, to show him a few things. I think, if he'll put up with that guy, maybe he won't mind if I noodle around a little on his piano. So I walk over to the shiny black grand piano and play a little bluesy ditty -- immediately I hear shouts coming from inside the piano. I get up and distance myself from it. Two groggy, angry skinheads crawl out and collapse on the floor, bleeding. They nurse the wounds I accidentally gave them and I join Monk at the piano. He shows me a melody and I improvise, but it's clear he wants me to go away, so I drift into conversation. I begin talking to two middle-aged black men. One is very lanky and shirtless, and has this wierd yellow fungus growing all over him. Vaguely as we talk I wonder if it's contagious. He has a very 'gay' manner. 

"You know who the French are erecting a national *monument* to?"

"Who?" says the other.

"James *Baldwin*, if you can believe that."

"I know him," I say. "When I was younger, I read 'Another Country' straight through."

It seems they didn't actually *like* James Baldwin, though, because I was then immediately excluded from the conversation. Baldwin, to them, was a fundamental issue.

So Brad comes along and we go to a party outside, on the hill, on the grass. Charles Bukowski is there with his girlfriend -- they're both young. It's a very warm night. Bukowski recites a few poems and everyone claps. I start to 'thank' him for one of his books, but then I remember his comment about that [in a book I had just flipped through] and forget it. I just talk to him and his girlfriend. But soon, Bukowski has to leave to do a poetry reading tour. So he gets in his huge armored car with his entourage and they dash off. His girlfriend is standing there, crying. Sarah puts her arm around her neck and I rub her back and hug her. I feel sorry for her that Bukowski has to leave so often, but at the same time I sense sexual possiblities between us. (Boy am I sensitive!) Then we come back to the plot of grass in Los Angeles. We look into the sky and every constellation is crammed into this absurd tiny space of sky. The rest of the sky was pitch black. I think "I didn't know you could see the stars in L.A." Somebody points out one constellation I've never seen before, a bird made of green stars with a glowing vibrant blue star for an eye. Everyone points the bird out. When I look back down to the plot, I realize Brad is gone.

"Well, shit," I think to myself.

"Your ride's gone," says Bukowski's girlfriend.

"That's alright. I don't even know what my parents' hotel was. I'll just catch a bus home later."

As we walk away from the place, I wonder who would be more likely to sleep with me, Sarah or Bukowski's girlfriend, and I decide on the latter, since she's lonely now. (722 words)

David: teenage dreams:#103 (03/29/98)I'm in my parent's RV. I'm on vacation someplace, again, and I see we're at a college, but this college is unique -- it's set up like a theme park. Each department has its own 'land' to decorate. Thus, here is Physicsland, here is Archaeologyland, etc. I stumble into the department for the study of subcultures -- everything is grungy and citylike. There's graffiti pieces everywhere, covering everything. Hookers are standing around. A street sign that says "TWO" is on the corner -- this was supposed to mean like Second Street, Downtown, etc. Somehow, I stumble into the Porn department. It seems that some religious vandal has been through, ripping the place apart, throwing videotapes and movie reels, film, photos, everywhere. Some bureaucratic vandals have been through, too -- the Porn department is being cut, immediately. The head of the department, a clean-cut, sixtyish, solid woman in a business suit, explains what's happening. As I stand there listening, two or three young women come in, wearing very casual, California surfer-type clothes. When they hear the news they become very, very upset -- one is even crying. they put a lot into their department, after all. Quite apart from the lascivious thought that I would *love* to see the films these ladies made, I feel very sorry for them. They're obviously seeing a lot of their work going down the tubes right now. I talk to one or two of them and make friends; I team up with a graffiti writer, too. We go back to my parents RV but they won't have anything to do with me; I've befriended scum and sluts. Well then, I think, fuck you too. We 'escape', taking the train tracks. Halfway along a strange plant is laying in the tracks, half green, half red. I immediately recognize it for a ludicrously huge celery plant. The red is the roots. I examine it carefully with a special examining hat the graffiti writer gives me. A huge freight train comes by and obliterates the celery. By way of contrast, I suppose, a BART train comes by and is nearly knocked off the tracks by a clod of dirt. Now somehow in here we end up carrying all these huge vegetables. Well, we're going to make our final escape through this person's house, but *somebody* slams a door, and by the time we get outside, it's TOO LATE!!! Guards are everywhere, and we're trapped. Just then a huge Native American man comes by and strikes a deal. They'll let us go if we divide up our huge veggies. We lay them on a table. We have nine. We would have had ten, but the celery was destroyed. (449 words)

David: teenage dreams:#104 (04/02/98)Brad and I are in the City of Effaced History, trading comments on books. I tell him: "You know, I like authors who've got energy first thing, like Hunter Thompson, the Dalai Lama..." Brad throws his hands up in the air. "Yes!" We get to the house. It's being held hostage by a bearded guy from the Irish Republican Army, because of a schism over the interpretation of a Buddhist text. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#105 (04/05/98)Later: In a courtyard I've seen before. Old yellow adobe buildings with old neon signs -- you know, letters outlined. I need to take a crap, so I go. While I'm on this huge concrete toilet in a large stall, a 'gang' comes in and begins gruesomely killing the person in the stall next to me. A woman who looks familiar comes into my stall and tells me she's not into what they're doing; she's going to do every perverted thing to me she's always wanted to do to a man. Okay! So she proceeds to do so. Once she's finished, I turn around and see she's metamorphosed into Laura. I hand her a copy of "V." by Thomas Pynchon. 

"This is a good book," I say. The telephone rings. I pick it up and say a lot of things in French in a gravelly voice. Finally Eric says: "David? Is that you? I knew it was you. Where are you, dude?"

"I was about to go down the coast, but it's been an hour and a half since Jimmy said he'd take me!"

"Right," says Jimmy, pulling on his pants. I remember it's storming outside, and that all this had something to do with Rhonda (female friend from highschool). (210 words)

David: teenage dreams:#106 (05/05/98)Inchoherency. I'm in a motel in town. Brad and Kathleen are in the room, which is filled with many huge bags of cheap books. I'm at the desk, writing my book. I set down the pen and go out; it starts to rain. I explain the ocean while watching the actions of a beautiful vain brunette woman on a bicycle, who later poses before the mirror admiring her own body. Sometimes she wears sweats, sometimes wears a leather thong and nothing else. Phenomenal legs. Many many months pass. A bar that everybody went into, and never came out of. Jimmy, Brad, other friends come and go. I was writing an autobiography. Water running hard through gutter. Trying to jump and grab rafters at end. (124 words)

David: teenage dreams:#107 (05/10/98)Laura and I are having sex. On a bus. In China. The driver got lost on his way to the hills. (21 words)

David: teenage dreams:#108 (05/29/98)I was reading books that Will had just written. Very Will. The covers were dark, mottled, evil looking, with shadowy pictures of him all over them, smoking cigarettes, wearing his boots, being evil. I read them through. They seemed very much like something Will would write, very natural. I thought they were unfocused, diffuse, full of sarcastic laughter and evil -- very good. They were like other of his writings but much better. 

Then, Brad and I were working on a corpse. These were the remains of a French abbe, a monk who lived in the fourteenth century. We were smashing his bones in the name of research. Or rather, I was. Because earlier I had a choice of occupation, and I chose smashing his bones, because the other job, sawing through his meat, was far too grisly for my stomach. Smashing his bones was the least gory and unpleasant of all the research Brad had to offer me. Even then, after I had the abbe's bones all laid out on the table and I picked up the skull and my hammer, I had an enormous amount of difficulty bringing myself to smash the skull in. Something about it was still too human, still too alive.

Then I guess I took a break or something, because all of a sudden I'm in a bakery, waiting in line. I ordered candied bread -- they didn't have any of that. So instead I got a loaf of raisin bread. As the baker, a young guy with blond hair and a yellow shirt, got the bread, I told him about my adventures with the abbe's bones. He was very unamused and glared at me with the most intensely angry, chilling blue eyes I have ever seen. Perhaps he was a Christian. Wisely, probably, I left the bakery and went back to bone-smashing.

When I came back, I learned that we were doing this research in the name of the National Geographic Society. No sooner had I set my loaf of bread down and picked up my hammer to keep smashing monk-bones when hot damn but George from Seinfeld reportedly steps on the work site. The resulting crush of tourists made it all but impossible to work. Luckily, I only had a metatarsal or two to grind into powder, so I finished up and packaged the dust up for Brad.

Whoops! Brad was suppossed to send the monk's bone-dust to "Cancun in China" but he sent it to somewhere called Xencin; transliteration error. Disastrous! The gleeful natives of Cancun, China nearly stole it for use as an aphrodisiac (Traditional Chinese Aphrodisiac: Powdered Monk Bones), but they sent it back to us after concluding they were on the side of science. Close one.

I guess it's after work, because now I'm passing the downtown library. I walk by the window; sitting at the tables, reading books, frozen in sleep, are all my friends from highschool. They are all asleep, sitting up straight, holding their books open. Josh in particular (a short guy with a beard, shoulder-length hair, leather jacket, smell of cologne, very soft-spoken and intelligent) has a half-there smile on his face, as though he knew I was outside the window, looking in, but he's too sharp to let people know he's awake when he's supposed to be asleep. The library was dark and closed, so evidently all these friends of mine had gotten trapped inside when the library closed, and so they had to sleep there, in the middle of their studies. Though it was more like their bodies had been put in suspended animation -- there was a very strong feeling that my friends in the window -- Josh, Nathan, Mike, and others -- had been *preserved* there somehow from time immemorial, as though they only gave the appearance of life. As though dust built up on them day after day after day, like they'd been pickled or formaldehyded and stuck with pins into their current "studying" positions.

Now I'm in some house, a hippie house in town. I'm in the main room with a very hostile guitarist. Every time I come near him he scowls and lashes out with a limb. So I keep to the other side of the room, amongst the huge pile of used books and board games. I see that these are separated into two main piles: civil rights materials, and a large pile of books and games about sex which dated from the seventies, and some porn magazines of the same era. Laura showed up from nowhere, and insisted I say something brilliant-sounding about the civil rights movement. Off the top of my head I said: "I think it was the defining political movement of the late twentieth century!"

I woke up at this point to use the bathroom, then I climbed back in bed and tried to go back to sleep. Alas, awaiting me in that half-world between sleep and waking, was an intensely frightening blue face, perfectly round, set off in the darkness. It looked like it was made of blue metal. STARING AT ME. Just this BLUE FACE, leering at me with this stupid, malevolent, menacing look. (864 words)

David: teenage dreams:#109 (06/11/98)Laura and I are at Kelly's place. We're working down on the road with a bunch of religious people. Kelly tells us to go to their bagel bakery. The baker, Que Cho (ficticious person), will give us each a bagel. Que Cho looks like he was a professional hit man before he turned to bagel baking. His skin is sompletely pockmarked and scarred, and his nose has definitely been broken more than once. Que Cho gives us each a bagel. We go back to the road. At 2 o'clock I hear somebody ask How much longer will it be until 'Jesus Hour'? Fifteen minutes, the other replies. I run back up to the house and find Laura in Kelly's room. "Kelly!" I say. "They're about to have Jesus Hour. I didn't want to get caught up in it so I came up to get Laura." 

"Don't worry," says Kelly. "When they ring the bell for Jesus Hour, just go into the closet there to hide. Later you can go by the bagel place again." Kelly picks up a stack of papers. "I had to learn a bunch of songs for today's Jesus Hour, so I can't really skip out."

They ring the bell and Laura and I go to hide in the closet. When everyone's gone, we go back to the bakery. We ask for another free bagel, and Que Cho gives it to us, but it's pretty clear that we're *really* pushing our luck with this guy. We get out as fast as we can.

For one brief instant, I'm walking up the large set of stairs at the Green Middle School. I walk by my 8th grade history teacher's room, and he's teaching a class.

Back in Kelly's room. Jesus Hour is almost over, and I really have to piss, but we can't find the bathroom, so I end up pissing in jars, cups, bowls, interrupting the flow every time the containers filled up. This went on for an absurdly long period until finally I woke up to use the bathroom. (343 words)

David: teenage dreams:#110 (06/16/98)We were cabin camping, Laura and I, but there was this strange guy following us all around the place. When he went away, Laura decided to do a little investigating and invaded his house: she examined the construction of his door, and the health of his animals. When we heard him coming we ran for it back to our cabin, and pulled the door, the blinds shut. Next day I left the cabin and out on the curb I met a Filipino kid with a skateboard. He broke something with it, he told me, and now he was fleeing his parents so he wouldn't have to 'pay'. I harbored him and his sister. His sister was younger than him, maybe eight years old, and she sat in the corner with her knees pulled up to her chest, skirt pulled up too far, rocking back and forth and chattering about everything a million miles an hour in a little squeaky voice. I remember that she was wearing white panties. I found a book on the floor that had a really creepy picture of how she would look as an adult in a leotard. Outside, the kid's parents were approaching. I told the kids: 'Go hide in the closet and pretend you're immortal!' This was supposed to protect them from their parents, but it was too late: the parents had seen us all together. They did this wierd bouncing thing, where they would take a step forward, sink down into their knees, bounce up, and step forward again, all with a transfixed glassy expression on their faces, chanting "Na na na! Na na na!" As if this wasn't enough, they were dressed like Mayflower Pilgrims. They cornered us -- the kids gave me something to read. After reading the kids' story, I said, "I put my faith in the children, not in *these* ruined adults!" and I threw a serape filled up with money at the boy. So the pilgrims shot me. Twice in the body, once in the mouth while they pushed me down into the creek. At this point I got a third person view of myself, and this person looked a lot like Mark Twain; not him, but it looked like him. They shot me/him in the mouth and the back of his head blew off, and green smoke began to pour out of his mouth as he sputtered and spit and sent teeth flying. Then he began to decay in the water. All the music stopped abruptly and I woke. Bleh. (423 words)

David: teenage dreams:#111 (06/26/98)Some crotchety old bastard was paying me to completely rewrite all of Douglas Adams' books, because he didn't like a lot of the things that were in them. And he wanted to get some things of his own in. I was instructed to give it a really long title in 18th century style: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, or, the adventures of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent blah blah blahblah blah for twelve pages. 

I was shopping at the food store with Laura. They had a new system -- you bought your food and rung it up yourself! Laura told me to get certain things, and whenever I got the wrong thing (due to some misunderstanding) she'd correct me. I was getting really irritated with her by the time she corrected me about the cereal. I poured back the wrong cereal and poured into my bag a cereal made from long strands of wheat and long strands of dried carrots. Just then Laura began helping this guy with long hair. His hair looked just like the cereal. (178 words)

David: teenage dreams:#112 (06/30/98)(Wartime in a besieged city. WWII trappings. Our hero is leaning against the wall, weeping, saying what may be his last farewell to his lover, who is also crying. A sharply dressed middle-aged man stiffly walks up to the scene. He is wearing a general's uniform.) THE GENERAL: "It is time to go to the Rue des Quatre Mains, sir." (The hero nods. Romantic music swells and fills the scene. The General moves off, and the hero delivers an impassioned speech to his lover.) THE HERO: "I'll never leave you, not even in the hour of death. If they catch me in the battle and execute me later, promise to understand, promise, that I will always be with you, always!" THE LOVER: "I promise!" (She wipes away a tear. The romantic music grows to a deafening pitch and weeping fills the theater. At the Lover's "I promise" the crowd in the movie theater does a standing ovation.) MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE: "BRavo! BRRRRrrrrravo!! What a beautiful scene! How touching!" (All the above noise cuts short as we see (third person view) that I am the author of the above scene. I am sitting on a rock, and I have just finished writing the final words spoken to the lover before being taken to his final battle. Two middle-aged women sit nearby.) WOMAN I: "I hear he's an author." WOMAN II: "That so? What's he working on?" WOMAN I: "A movie, I think." WOMAN II: "Hmm! Imagine that." (247 words)

David: teenage dreams:#113 (07/02/98)Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and Darth Vader were fighting with light sabers -- Marty McFly (Michael Fox) and Luke Skywalker were in on the action, too. At some point Marty McFly killed Luke Skywalker. Then Doc killed Darth Vader. Somehow, then, Doc was fighting his evil twin, and then somehow the good Doc became evil, too. In the end, the one evil Doc killed off the other evil Doc, and the surviving evil Doc began walking towards me, swirling his light saber around in a circle. Then the end of the saber kind of 'broke' and the evil Doc cut off his own head. It sailed through the air and hit the ground, spewing blood. Doc's head croaked: "Entire life's work... up in smoke..." Marty McFly jumped up and shouted "DOC!" like in the movie. A group of tourists walked by, but they didn't notice anything. (145 words)

David: teenage dreams:#114 (07/03/98)Dreamt about a concentration camp. I was going to rescue some people from Birkenau. A gaunt, half-starved Jewish man who looked like Kafka was guiding me. I remember, I didn't want to see the dead bodies particularly. (37 words)

David: teenage dreams:#115 (07/04/98)I dreamt all night long, but now I only remember snatches -- a spider dream, a dream about camping, one at the Hillside Library, and one about some strange backwoods country dance where one man had three dozen pairs of clay eyes running up and down the bridge of his nose, and this girl who was previously thought ugly redid her hair and ended up being gorgeous. "All the men's eyes" were on her, and the singer of the band with the three dozen eyes had them all trained on her. So the singer's three dozen eyes was supposed to represent the eyes of all the men at the dance. (110 words)

David: teenage dreams:#116 (07/05/98)I was on the bus to Hillside, and I noticed that up by the front of the bus there was a table with a pile of books for sale to whoever would want them. I flipped through the pile and they were all good books, but I didn't have any money, or not much at least. Eventually I got a Hemingway book, "A Farewell to Arms", I believe. Back at the bus station to pay for my book. As I'm waiting for the driver I hear gunshots; people right next to me have gotten their heads blown off. One guy has half his head across the way and is writhing all over the place. I calmly step over the bodies and head for the bus. But the bus is leaving! Shit! I begin to run down the street in an effort to arrive at the next bus stop before it does (usually an easy thing with the Hillside buses) but suddenly everything in that part of town turns into a really dense meadow with really tall grass, and I can't get through it fast enough to catch the bus. 

Somehow, later, I'm walking along, flipping through my new copy of "A Farewell to Arms" and suddenly I'm in 1920's Italy. Early 1920's. (Hemingway's book is set in 1917-1918 Italy.) I'm in the ballroom of a really fancy Italian hotel. It is filled with all kinds of people. A curtain draws back and we see Ernest Hemingway. He reads a notice: "All fairies, raise their hands!" A naked, hairy, fat man raises his rifle, hoots, and shoots out the light. Confusion ensues. When the light comes back on, there are 20 or 30 transvestites in shiny evening dress standing around a pool. One by one they're shot and fall into the pool. I think it's all Hemingway's doing, and that he must be standing behind that curtain, shooting them down. I think it's sick, but I don't know how to stop it, and besides, I'm out of my real time (echoes of Back to the Future again) and I don't really want to either endanger my own life or mess up history. I escape this madness by using the emergency elevator, which basically just drops you to the first floor, knoking your lower jaw through the crown of your skull on impact. Or that's how it feels, anyway. The doors slide open and I stagger into the lobby, and out onto the steps. It is a peaceful spring morning in Italy, Florence, I think. Firenzi. It is the 1920's. Hemingway is sitting by the exit, bandage wrapped around his head, staring off into space, whistling an aimless tune. (447 words)

David: teenage dreams:#117 (07/06/98)Laura and I are half-buried in the mud at the bottom of the train tunnel, laying down and hiding out. We were hiding there, I explained, for the same reasons the bums hung out at the opening end every morning -- it was a hell of a lot warmer than any other place at that time of day, due to the draft. Suddenly they built a train station around us. It would take you to New York City. It was all shiny and modern-looking, and Laura and I did go to New York. I considered how close New York was all along, and wondered why we never went. We came back and I went to work at the Green City Library with Larry. That woman Patti was at the desk. At closing time, a woman walked in and Patti refused to help her. "We're closed. Sorry. That's all. We're closed." Then she started *doing her makeup* and putting on jewelry. That annoyed me a lot. She refused to help someone at one minute to closing because she wanted to put on makeup? Larry walked with me across the wierd hills to the train station and explained how he could take my job on Mondays since I didn't like it on that day. And I was going anyway. "Yeah, but I want to *save* money before we go, and I'd lose $120 a month that way!" ($120 is 1/3 of my paycheck; I work 3 days a week.) "Besides, Laura wants to take Biology 3C and..." "But, I'm not *in* highschool anymore," she protests. "We could leave any day!" (268 words)

David: teenage dreams:#118 (07/07/98)I dreamt that I was writing quite a bit. I remember squeezing Laura's breasts, and somebody was passing around an inflatable woman. (22 words)

David: teenage dreams:#119 (07/08/98)I'm waiting to be picked up to go somewhere far away with Jimmy and I'm not sure what music to listen to -- after a while I pick Tori Amos. I pack and get all ready to go. Remembering my experience last time of not having anything to read, I load up my backpack not just with notebooks but with about 20 books, mostly 3 big shiny books by Bernard Shaw. I get into the van with Kelly and her new trucker boyfriend who wonders why I read so much. Then we're taking a bit of a break before leaving and I'm crossing this huge, rickety, wooden footbridge over the river at night. It's raining pretty hard and everything's wet and glistening. Halfway along I notice all kinds of loose change scattered across the bridge, so I go about picking it all up, especially the pennies, because "I'll need all the luck I can get." I find one really huge penny -- it's about a foot in diameter. This one's really lucky. As I'm kneeling to pick up all the change, a man comes along with his two kids. I don't want to look suspicious, so I open the cabinet in the side of the bridge and pull out two cans of Coke. He shines a flashlight on me, then goes away with his kids. (225 words)

David: teenage dreams:#120 (07/11/98)I was a delivery driver in Green City. Here there were a special kind of spiders which would help you find your way: they laid their eggs around a light and made it glow. Then I was in a fancy Indian Southwestern hotel which was like a movie theater. There were a lot of porn stars, and an orgy. A lot of dead rich people. They left me and Laura stuff. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#121 (07/14/98)Laura sold the minivan and bought, for $6000, an inflatable Mustang hovercraft. She called it an Air Car. If you drained it of air, you could fold it up and pack it away. We went for a ride in it. She told me more about it as she stood in the kitchen, naked, intermittently drinking from a glass of water. (60 words)

David: teenage dreams:#122 (07/18/98)I was in my parents' house checking email, and somehow or other the dream got transferred to some kind of workplace. One of my coworkers was a black woman and I discovered to my horror that somebody had sent her a message IN MY NAME inviting her to a movie and calling her a nigger. In my parents' house I found a dream notebook containing several lost dreams, or dreams I thought I had lost forever. I sat down at the computer to type these out in email for Jimmy; that's when I discovered the email thing. Well, it changed into an office and I went to apologize to the woman and explain how appalled I was about the message, that I would change my password. I saw a large poster of a middle-aged man with a moustasche above her desk. Supposed to be her father. The caption read: DADDY IN A BAD MOOD: WATCH OUT! There was the same picture with caption on the desk. 

And now I'm at some kind of graduation. Everybody needs to wear a tie, even me, even though I'm wearing a hooded sweatshirt. A lot of people are there: Andy, Jimmy, Brent, Larry, and so on. Someone gives me a tie and I sling it over my shoulder, pretend to be an aviator, antics like that. Then I notice Larry is tying a red tie. I call out to him: "Hey, Larry, this is kind of wierd. I dreamt about you tying a red tie just like that..." "At a graduation," Laura says, eyes wide. "Just like this," I finish, in growing fright. Fright, because I "realize" I dreamt the whole thing before in every detail, exact down to the last, and it has now come %100 true. The scare was so wrenching I woke with a shout. (304 words)

David: teenage dreams:#123 (07/20/98)We bought property in Montana, and a huge stretch of land north of there was a national park. (18 words)

David: teenage dreams:#124 (07/21/98)Last night I dreamt I was at the theater, some kind of theater production that Dylan was somehow involved with. I saw him and called him over, and we talked a while, and he invited me to go over to some cafe down the road. So we walked down the street and he showed me this cafe. All the walls were pink and stuccoed, and the barista stood behind this hole in the wall where he took your orders. Well, Dylan grabbed a 1-liter Coke and left the money on the counter, but I didn't want so much soda, so I ordered a can of Pepsi and set some quarters on the counter. Turns out the guy who ran the place was John of John's Liquors down by Eastern High School. I leaned through the hole in the wall to place my order and saw Jack sitting there, not really doing anything besides staring off into space. He took a shot of whiskey and ignored me. Then I noticed his entire extended family in the back of the cafe: his grandparents, sleeping in bed, his parents, and so on. Then, of all people, Elizabeth Church came in through the back door and gave Jack a very loving hug, just as though they had been married and were totally in love despite the 30-year age difference. Eventually Elizabeth got me my soda and I thanked her, and talked with her a while, updating her on what was going on in my life and trading info and so on. Then Dylan and I left the cafe; he waved goodbye to Elizabeth, and we walked out onto the street, which had become a field of wildflowers in the meantime. We walked through the field and I told Dylan I was going to visit that cafe more frequently in the future, since I knew so many people who hung around it, including him and Elizabeth, whereas in other cafes I went to nobody knew me at all. I told him about everything going on in my life, my plans, my book, my girlfriend (soon to be wife). At this point Dylan said something like, "The artist's job, you see, is to frame beauty in its proper setting," and we nearly tripped over Laura, who was laying on her side, naked, in the wildflowers. I introduced her and Dylan, and then we stepped over her and kept walking through the field, discussing. (407 words)

David: teenage dreams:#125 (07/23/98)A huge volcano long thought to be extinct, was erupting outside the house in Green City, sending down enormous flaming chunks of ice. I finally got into the house safely along with some few teenage girls, friends of my brother. I sat down in a booth in the living room -- it had booths just like a restaurant -- and played the guitar for my grandparents. I then went and fetched from the car some Hemingway book I bought in hardcover. Somehow, the Starship Enterprise, with warp drive beams emerging fromt the eyes of Worf and Captain Picard, had something to do with the erupting volcano. I got into a conversation with this guy in the house about language and how we develop habits of hiding behind smiles and kind words in conversation, when all we really want to do is smash in their goddamn faces. He tells me this with a strained smile. At this point my dad stands up, excusing himself to piss. I've got to do the same. We were all waiting out the volcano, see. (179 words)

David: teenage dreams:#126 (07/24/98)I was a little fat boy chasing a strange bird. It had the face of a rat with huge eyes, and huge black wings with gold tips that it beat as quickly as a hummingbird. I chased it into a meadow, whereupon I learned that the way it disguises itself is by burying itself headfirst in the dirt and sprouting a flower out its ass, so you can't tell the birds from the flowers nor the flowers from the birds.

David: teenage dreams:#127 (07/26/98)Jimmy wanted to do something for my birthday, something I didn't want to do. Naturally, he didn't listen when I told him so, and I was constrained to hide in the old wood stove at my parents' house (I used to hide in it when I was very little.) (49 words)

David: teenage dreams:#128 (08/04/98)Bitter and angry about everything in Hillside. The Market was closing, and they wouldn't let me withdraw money. Ended dream by strangling Jimmy because he wouldn't park his damn van, just kept driving it back and forth. Laura ran up at the same moment and asked what I was doing -- just then I woke up and she was staring at me. Angry like I can't usually be -- at *everything*. Punching walls of the van. Then, after getting rid of Jimmy, we had a bum in our room. We were sitting there talking and he kind of transformed into Alan. He tells me (gold ring in his ear) It's better to be a free man than a bondsman. (Echoes of Thomas More!) I told him that all walks of life come with their own worries, troubles, bothers. He then changed into that guy from a local coffee shop, the grey-haired guy with the leather coat. He began to lecture me in that condescending way bums have when they think you don't understand just how demeaning and uncomfortable their lives are. "Now listen John, Joseph, James Josh..." He began every sentence directed at me with this formula. At one point I opened the door to force him out. (208 words)

David: teenage dreams:#129 (08/07/98)I dreamt I was going to meet Frank at the Green City Movie Theater for a movie. But I got stuck at the Hillside Library trying to find a copy of Steinbeck's book, Sea of Cortez, in a really cheap edition put out from someone's typewriter and facsimile machine. Came time to go--20 minutes past my shift's end. I ran down to Hillside and boarded two enormous German Shepherd dogs. This was a really archaic form of transportation, apparently, like caveman-transportation. I rode on the back of one until it got tired and then I switched. These dogs didn't know me too well, though, so I got a lot of bites and scratches. (113 words)

David: teenage dreams:#130 (08/12/98)First I dreamt that I was operating a little RC research car on the planet Mars. While the car was going around collecting samples of minerals, etc. I was sitting in a station somewhere on the planet. I screwed up somehow at some point and the little RC car broke open the door of my station, allowing the zero-atmosphere of Mars to rush in and destroy all life inside, including mine. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#131 (08/12/98)I was standing on a road near Hillside, in the middle of the night, with my supervisor. She handed me a library video and told me I needed to return it. I agreed to return it for her, and I walked over to where the Denny's is in reality. In my dream there was another building here which I lived in. I got into my room all filled with books and records and food, and suddenly there came a knock on the door. Somehow I *knew* the knocking was some old friends of mine I didn't want to see, so I didn't open the door. (My room, by the way, was like a janitor's closet in some institution. There were no windows and the only light came from a bare bulb hanging in the middle of the room.) Still, it was nice to have visitors, so I went ahead and peeked out the door. Mistake. Matt and Steve forced their way into the room. They made havoc out of a good deal of things until Robinson Jeffers showed up (poet, American, 1887-1963). I imagined him from a characoal drawing on the cover of a collection of his poems I just bought. I really had to pee, but the only thing around was a paper bag, so I pissed in that. When it was filled up and beginning to leak out the bottom, I ran into the hallway to dump it out. Naturally I had to pee when I woke up at this point. (253 words)

David: teenage dreams:#132 (08/12/98)I was down on the road I used to live on in Green City, at the bottom of the driveway where Cara used to live. Here there was a soft, marshy sort of area and in the middle of it, a tombstone. I forget what the exact words were on the thing but the gist was: some kid had run away from home and accidentally stepped into this marsh, which sucked him under and killed him. The tombstone had been placed there to warn all future runaways. I don't know how the tombstone stayed there. A whole bunch of other kids gathered and sat down around the tombstone and talked to me about it. Yeah, it's really sad, they agreed, but some kids really *need* to run away from home. Besides, there's not that many marshes out there. (138 words)

David: teenage dreams:#133 (08/12/98)I was at work and needed to take the bus back to town. So I walked down to the pickup point to get on the bus, and found there was no bus, only three or four beat-up old pickup trucks driven by good-ol-boys. Some disreputable old people from the apartment complex, Morton and his wife, plus another guy that stares at me a lot, were waiting in line, too. "Morton" and his wife were shouting at one another as usual, and the other old guy just stood there, being unnerving. Luckily, they all got in this one blue pickup together. I got in the red one behind them. As I got in the car, I asked: "So. We're going to S City?" Without really answering, the guy said: "Shuttle to B Town!" I was clasping a dollar in my hand and I resolved not to pay if I could possibly avoid it. There was a long drive along a crazy screwed up road, and the upshot was, in order to get to B Town at all we had to drive over the treetops of this really dense forest. So the goodolboy begins driving over the trees and the guy in the back really begins protesting violently, which makes the goodolboy lose his concentration (it takes a lot of concentration to drive on treetops, you know!) and the car kind of tips like a boat taking on water, and then finally falls through the trees twenty or thirty feet. Lucky for me my window was open -- I clambered through the window just as the car tipped onto its side, and took refuge in a branch. When the car hit the ground I climbed down the tree and joined the people. The other passenger was laying motionless at the bottom of a chainlink fence (wind knocked out) and same with the goodolboy. They were both alive, though, and arguing enough that I could sneak off without paying. 

The chainlink fence, as it turned out, was guarding my parents' Summer Palace. This was a huge sprawling mansion, most of its rooms hardly even used, three or four used intensively. The place was a thorough disaster. In one room the walls were lined with peeling cork. (Proust?) There was a stack of books like the donation pile at the Hillside library. These were paperbacks I have looked at in the used book store, but have decided not to buy. I was very happy to find them just sitting here now, though, because it meant I could have them for free, when it wasn't worth the two or three dollars apiece to buy them. There were books by Melville and Henry Fielding, both of whom I've had a lukewarm interest in this past month. Laura was with me in this room. She said: "Gee, it's too bad my mother doesn't live here. She deserves a big place like this." Just at that point, her mother showed up and whooshed around in her normal way, apologizing for the mess and attending to one thousand little errands at the speed of light in order to get them all done before dinner in a half hour. You get the feeling she's been going like that all day long. In an aside she mentioned to me that if I wanted to give music lessons, I can do it in her name and she'll pay me under the table, since she's registered and it would be a pain in the ass for me to register, since I'm going to be leaving in a few months. Then Laura and I walk into the next room. Here are where all the registration forms are to be found. Laura hadn't heard her mother tell me I could give lessons in her name, so I begin telling her. Right as I'm about to give away the game the old lady in charge of registrations totters up and asks me what I'm doing. "Registering to give piano lessons!" She hands me a registration form, and tells me sweetly that I really must register, since it's very illegal to give lessons without registering, etc. etc. etc. I smile and let her dodder off into the other hallways of the mansion. I turn to Laura with a look like "Whew! That was a close one!" and I wake up. (723 words)

David: teenage dreams:#134 (08/18/98)I kept dreaming about an underground room. I woke at one point thinking, 'Gee, that was Freudian." Later I dreamt of a box in a tall cabinet containing beans Laura and I had sprouted and forgotten about. They had grown somehow into lush green plants, vines which clung to the walls of the cabinet, with leaves that resembled staghorn ferns. (60 words)

David: teenage dreams:#135 (08/19/98)My supervisor tried the lights in the main room of the library -- for some reason they wouldn't go on for her. Me either. So we decided to tell Lauren we couldn't open the library because there would be no light. Lauren showed up and banged on the door -- I let her in, scowling, and told her what was happening, whereupon she tried the lights and found they worked for her. DAMN. So we had to run through the whole process of setting up, and I was angry with my supervisor for having raised my hopes in the first place. In the other room it was exactly the way everything had been in my room in Green City, except instead of my bookcase there was the pamphlet file, and of course I had no bed there. Hiding behind my chair and a large pile of books I poked idly through the 'A' file. In between American Artists and American Indians I was secretly composing a book, a few pages at a time. At one point Lauren burst in, but thankfully she didn't notice what I was doing. Somehow I began reading a pamphlet about Ed Ricketts, and I began to see the scene as it was narrated by a Steinbeck-like voice: "Back in the thirties, we hired Ed to do some rock crushing for us." (The view slowly zoomed in on Ricketts, who was standing behind a large pile of rocks in work overalls from the thirties, holding a shovel. He was beckoning me over. Narrator:) "Come over here," he said to me one day. "Look at this." (I walked up and saw that he had dug up some strange sort of tree, one which had branches coming off it like a trimmed palm tree -- that is, the branches had been sawed off -- but these chevron-shaped branches had the color and consistency of celery. Narrator:) "Ed! Thank God you cut this off at the root, because that's a part we can regrow. This is a water-bowl tree, Ed. It'll bring us a fortune!" (Ed flushed and looked abashed. He helped me pick up the tree and load it into the nursery. While this scene was going on the voice-over said:) "I think the waterbowl tree brought us $900 in 1948, the year of Rickett's death. With the money we established a memorial. I hope Ed, wherever he is, understands what we have done. These words were taken from John Steinbeck's "My Life in California"." (417 words)

David: teenage dreams:#136 (09/25/98)I was at a party of some sort, with all kinds of people from the Middle School. The crowd at this party is a very select group. They are people from the Middle School, whom I subsequently met, after gradution, under different circumstances. Thus it is an odd collection: Kelly J. and Jasmine are there, as well as that girl named Shannon. Many people who would never mix are here, because I ran into them in later life. Notably absent are most of my infatuations, though I later met some of them. The only one here is Amy. I talk to her for a little while, and she gives me her phone number, tells me to call her, and then, after I talk to Kelly J. a bit more, I dreamt I woke up. But I woke up in some mythical apartment; I did not wake into my real life but into some alternate life. Here I write down the phone number Amy gave me in my dream and after a brief hesitation, I dialed it. A man answered the phone, presumably her father, and I asked for Amy. He got her and we talked for a while. "But how did you find my number?" "Well, it's really wierd... I dreamt you gave it to me." The upshot of the conversation was I was to come and visit her, in the state she had moved to, so we could talk. I promised I'd be there as soon as I could. So I got in a car and drove to her house. She greeted me and showed me her room, and we sat down on the bed and started to talk. We had a lot to say. So much had happened in the meantime. She produced a thick bundle of papers which she had written up for college, which described everything in her life and everything she believed in, everything she wanted to do with her life and so on. I had nothing comparable so I went to the car and retrieved the first five chapters of my novel and gave it to her. We sat on the bed -- I mean laid down, and kissed and exhanged a hug. We looked into each other's eyes a while, and decided that we had made a mistake in ever separating. (388 words)

David: teenage dreams:#137 (10/05/98)I had a dream the other night that me, Woody Allen, and Laura were all sitting around a big oak table in the middle of a sparkling white kitchen. We were having a conversation, I don't remember what, but it became clear that this was Woody's beach house and we were staying there a while. We all went to sleep. In the morning Laura and I went out through the kitchen around the side of the building, along a boardwalk which stretched to the beach outside. It was just dawn. My wife was carrying a volleyball, a tennis ball, and a golf ball. When we got to the beach next to the house, we began throwing the balls back and forth, but they all accidentally fell under the house, through those rectangular vent-holes, you know what I'm talking about? My wife tried to get them out with a stick, but that project failed. In the end I tried shoving my arm through the hole and reaching for the balls. I got my shoulder stuck for a minute or two, and at that point Woody Allen joined us. He made the observation that I was stuck in the vent, and the two of them yanked me out of my fix. Then we all stood around in a circle and tossed the volleyball around. (222 words)

David: teenage dreams:#138 (10/06/98)I was standing before the mirror, applying shaving cream to my beard and hair with the back of the razor. Only, I kept getting confused as to what was hair and what was beard, so instead of shaving off the beard like I'd intended, I ended up shaving out little chunks of beard and hair. It looked horrible. I approached my father in shame. My father, in this dream, was a Tibetan nobleman. I set down the camp mirror and made sure everything was set in the camp, and my 'father' and I began to walk up the street. Towards the house. Just outside the house, I found three pennies on the ground and picked them up. Remeber, we're in Tibet. "Odd money," I said. "European money," he said. "No, American." He grabbed them and flung them into the street. Startled by his rage, I said: "Oh, right, dad. Somebody can, uh, trade them in. Buy an apple." He glared at me, then looked up at the menacing clouds in the sky; they were rushing across the sky and were amber-colored and grimy-looking. We entered the portico and I whispered to my father, so the kids wouldn't hear: "Those clouds spell trouble." He nodded, and said: "American money." He fixed me with an earnest look. "They have arrived." (218 words)

David: teenage dreams:#139 (11/01/98)First I'm in a nondescript house. My 'sister' is one of the clerks at the Hillside Market: a short, small, insubstantial brunette girl who always wears piles and piles of clothing, perhaps to add to her size. Anyway, she walks through the house wearing black sweater, black sock hat, black everything, trailed by her simian boyfriend. He has a sloping forehead, eyebrows growing together, he slouches, wears a leather jacket with a chain over a T-shirt with some band logo on it, and dirty jeans. In the meantime the place has coalesced into something resembling my mother-in-law's house, where we're sleeping tonight. I go into the other room to get my biography of James Joyce, and find that my old friend Steve has placed a band logo right over the front cover picture of Joyce, so that the cover looks like a band logo in a straw hat and tailored shirt. I'm somewhat annoyed, because my copy was in perfect condition and it's a good book, but I figure I can get the sticker off. Then I realize that Steve has signed it on the title page: "Hey David This is you're old budy Steve hey!" Idiot. God damn it, I think, dropping the book, because I realize that they've ALL been here. All the old band members of every band I've ever been in has come in and left his sticker and signature on one or another of my books. Thankfully, only some two and a half dozen books, mostly paperbacks, have been ruined, so it's no big loss. The main damage was to Ellmann's Joyce biography. So I go out into the hall carrying nothing, intending to tell Laura about this, when I find my way blocked by my younger brother, Nick. Except in the dream he's my older brother, and over the course of the following conversations and actions, he becomes the actor who plays Frazier's brother on the T.V. show Frazier. He shows me a jar filled with something grey. "What is it?" I ask. "Ashes." "Ashes?" "The ashes of Cary Grant." "Cary Grant was quite a womanizer, wasn't he?" "Yes, he was," says my brother, who shows me a film about all of Cary Grant's women. We then find ourselves in a storage room in my parent's house, riffling through a desk. We're looking for the photographs of Cary Grant's women. I turn up a small rubberbanded pile of hot rod magazines, kept, it seems, primarily for the swimsuit models. Because Nick turns very red and says: "Put those back! Now!" I kind of laugh and say, "What's wrong with them? What's the big deal?" knowing full well why he's so embarrassed, but wanting to cure him of that embarrassment. It doesn't work and he shuts the drawer himself, saying: "They're mine. You can't have them." Now we're in Arizona, my brother and I, with a bottle of Cary Grant's ashes. We're sitting at an old picnic table below a freeway. On the other side of the freeway is a huge red cliff. I open the jar of ashes to get a better look, and like an idiot, I spill them. Now, that would have been fine, except it was a picnic table, so the ashes begin to pour through the spaces between the boards. Frantically, I try to contain the pile and put as much of it as I can back in the jar. My brother, apparently (now the actor-guy) knows all about cleaning up Cary-Grant-ash-spills, and he gives me a straw. He shows me how to clean up the spill and retrieve every ash: all you have to do is put the straw in the jar and point the jar at the cliff; then, you eject the ashes at the cliff. The ashes bounced off the cliff face and swooped around the back of the table, then swooped around you again, hit the cliff face, and bounced back into the jar. The straw was to direct the initial flow, so the outgoing and incoming streams of ashes would not collide and make a mess. (681 words)

David: teenage dreams:#140 (11/01/98)What's happening is that I grew up in a big city back East, and my parents for some reason have decided to move to a suburb in California. Well, they pick a part of town that reminds them of their neighborhood in the old days, and my mother asks me to do her a favor: could I please get our new poodle puppy baptized? I take the little white poodle and begin walking down the street to the church. Even though at the beginning I was supposed to have grown up in New York, reality flashes in for a moment and now I think: good thing I grew up here or I'd never find the church. I make one left, one right, and I walk down a huge corridor of brownstone buildings. Now I begin to descend into the church area, and now the little poodle has been transformed into a little black kitten. I approach the church and its yard, which is filled with people doing things. It looks more like a firestation than a church: it too is made out of brownstone, it is blocky and square, and right in front there are four square fountains, filled with people doing all sorts of outrageous things: playing water polo, having sex, performing religious ceremonies. Well, I start to walk down thinking: it ought to be easy to get the kitten baptized in all this craziness. But right as I begin to get near a pool, one of the Hillside library patrons, a woman I've never talked to or heard talk to anyone, steps forth with her finger out, shaking her head. "No. No. No kittens are allowed in the church." I argue the point with her for several minutes, pointing out the water polo, the sex. She responds that those are human activities, not kitten activities, and that if I wanted the kitten baptized I'd have to go to a kitten church. I'm pretty annoyed by all this, and as I leave I see another one of the library patrons, a big Middle Eastern guy, shaking his head. "Don't you hate that," he laments. "Oh, I don't really care." I had resolved to tell my mother I got the kitten baptized anyway, because it didn't really seem to matter. "Senile old women," he says. "They are all senile." "Well," I try to think of a diplomatic way to disagree. "Some women are old, but not all are senile." At this point I dreamt that I woke up in Laura's mom's house and began to tell Laura the beginning of my dream, which I lost by the time I woke up for real. We have apples and orange juice, (as we'd agreed on the night before for breakfast) and as I'm telling her I keep getting interrupted: people are arriving. An odd assortment of people: Brad's younger brother Stephen, who begins to set up a computer in the corner and some homeless hippie types with boxes of leaves. The hippie types had come up in Hannah's car, and Laura and I sat in the back of her grey station wagon sorting through the boxes of leaves with tweezers. Finally I get to the part where I'm trying to baptize the kitten, and the hippie types demand their boxes of leaves, so we go back inside. I retell dramatically the part where the woman pushes me away, saying 'no', and at the whole discussion involving kitten churches, Stephen just erupts into laughter: he thinks what I'm talking about is real, because he missed the beginning. As he laughs, he begins to drool, and when he wipes his mouth on his sleeve, he accidentally stretches his lip so that it hangs to his chin. Whoops. (623 words)

David: teenage dreams:#141 (11/04/98)Andy sent me some email at some point in the past, and we're standing before a blackboard, discussing the topic: improving social skills. Andy makes a very amusing algebraic equation about the dynamics of meeting new people: "Okay. You're variable a. Right now you're talking to b. a plus b is equal to i, which is a conversation. Meanwhile there's this other person, whose existence you are not even aware of. He's constant L, for Life, because he's a part of existence you don't know about, but who's always there. Now L would like to interpolate himself on the sum-side of this equation..." And he goes on and on in a very erudite manner, graphing it and everything. Now I meet his grandparents and talk to him for a little while about this and that. He tells me something astonishing and I joke: "Well, Bob's your Uncle!" "Grandpa," Andy corrects. "Yours too." And he's right: both of us have grandparents named Bob. Now I'm in S City with Andy, Laura, two guys from Junior High who I haven't thought about since, and the main character of my book, Richard Sampson. We're just walking along, talking; Laura, as usual, is about a mile ahead, trying to avoid conversation. The two guys from junior high are talking about pizza behind us. I'm still talking to Andy about his email message. We begin to climb the scaffolding of the new parking garage downtown, and I'm telling Andy how amusing I thought his email message was, and I sort of respond to it, when Andy intervenes: "Say, shouldn't we really save this for email, to give us something to do when we log on?" I agree and we begin to climb down the scaffolding, having had enough of the view. The two pizza guys behind us suggest going to a pizzeria: apparently they know of a good one. Only, Laura is now two miles ahead and I *know* she doesn't know where the pizzeria is. I wake up before we can all regroup. (339 words)

David: teenage dreams:#142 (11/13/98)Dreamt that I went to visit my old house. My mom was there to greet me: but this was no ordinary Mom. No, this is the anti-Mom. This Mom has her own life. She has things to do. She's busy. She's together; she isn't neurotic. And she's been living in this house all along. Well, she had a job she needed to get to, but she agreed to give me a tour anyway. There was a little girl there, my analogue, or I suppose my homologue, since she would have served a different function in the life of the anti-Mom from the one I serve in real life. The girl was very bouncy and happy. (115 words)

David: teenage dreams:#143 (11/21/98)Hard to describe. First the wharf. Walking along the wharf at night. But it is more than the wharf: it is an entire waterfront, a vast wharf the length of three wharves and the width of twenty wharves. I'm moving with the loose crowd. Suddenly the ocean is filled with dozens of sea monsters. These are vast sea dragons, creatures like giant dogs with scales and spinning paddles for legs, enormous snakes with frayed tails. All the creatures are reptillian. I'm whisked along to the library. A man returns a book on tape which has many of the wrong tapes. Some of the tapes are to be used with a good computer: you pop them in and a movie runs on the screen. Most of the cassettes are audiobook tapes. One is a feature film. Several are porn movies. All are issued by the same individual: a man named Ulric. I grab one of the porn tapes and watch it on the computer. Now I'm in a castle. I ascend to the top floor, porn cassette in hand, intent on finding some private place to jack off. Lo and behold, I soon find Bill Gates' bedroom! There is a curtained bed in the room, just like kings had in castles like this. I go over to the bed, and find that, inside the curtain, there is a state-of-the-art PC installed in the bed. Perfect place, I think to myself: private, comfortable, and fully equipped with just the technology I need. Yet I'm nervous about doing this in another person's room, when I don't even know where that person is. So I decided to forget about the movie and walk downstairs: I need to take a shower. I find a shower room and begin to enter: inside the room, with her back turned to me, is one of the patrons from the Hillside library. She is large, not especially attractive, and about fourteen years old. She is stripping to take a shower. I consider: I don't give a crap about her, and I need a shower. But then: it is highly likely that she would be embarrassed and perhaps even disturbed by the presence of a nude man. Ah, shit, I say to myself. I don't want to upset anybody. So I go off in search of a different shower room, knowing fully that there is no other shower. In my search I find Ulric, who decides to hire me to read a book on tape. But then I tell him I live in my car and this bearded, balding, fat middle-aged man tells me I'm worthless, and he gets very hostile, cancelling the earlier agreement. I tell him I'm going to Mexico, and the bastard begins testing my knowledge of Spanish. I play along, though, never pretending to understand when I don't, and soon enough I uncover the holes in his Spanish. I ask him about a word he used, and he's totally speechless. He can't tell me what the word means. It's like he made it up. Bastard. (509 words)

David: teenage dreams:#144 (12/02/98)I'm going to elope with a gorgeous Jewish woman. But who's standing in our way? William S. Burroughs. I must pass his tests before we can elope. What does his primary and most important test consist of? I must take a one foot length of silk ribbon, and tie it around my neck. Now, while leaving it on my neck, I must stretch it somehow to run down my back, down my pants, around my feet, back up my pants, up through the front of my shirt, and around my neck again into a bow tie. Needless to say, I fail the test. Burroughs goes cackling off, dancing a little jig. We decide to elope anyhow. (116 words)

David: teenage dreams:#145 (12/13/98)I am the Devil, and I'm scheduled to appear in a musical. Everybody else thinks I'm a mere mortal *playing* the Devil, but I know better. I show up at the right time. The musical begins; everything is very Babylonian. There is an enormous man in the middle of the room, wearing a turban and sitting on a throne. The jungle drums begins. He throws his arms up and shakes as the chorus sings: "Seven hundred twenty eight pounds/six hundred of them fat!" Now, it is his part in the musical to jump on me, and then I was to pretend to kill him with the fake weaponry. But since I am the Devil, after all, unmitigated evil incarnate, I opt for hacking him to pieces with my axe for real when he lands on me. The audience marvels at the special effects as I walk off the stage, leaving the dismembered fat man stewing and quivering in his own blood. (161 words)

David: teenage dreams:#146 (12/13/98)I'm on a ferry with my family. The ferry is also a submarine: it's like a submarine/cruise liner. We dive underwater; I'm the only one who missed the notification, and as the ship dives at a ninety degree angle, I careen through several hallway openings before finally crash landing at the front of the ship. I land in a dining room with Nick and the family, and for a while we watch the fish floating by the outside of the glass. The dining room is designed for undersea watching, you see. Nick and I decide we've had enough and go to get our luggage. (104 words)

David: teenage dreams:#147 (12/15/98)Soft piano music with a string orchestra in the background. Autumn leaves fall around the road in a crisp wind. The sun is angling through the trees, casting a gold glow over everything. The massive RV has a large empty space in the middle, and everybody is laying around under blankets inside. The RV is slowing to a halt. It's clear our journey is coming to an end. It is my job to distribute the magazines. I give one to Laura and set one aside for myself. There are two other people I don't know in the RV, and I give them their magazines. I approach Kermit the Frog, who takes a copy of People, and thanks me profusely. I go up to the driver's cockpit as Dr. Teeth (who has been driving) brings the RV to the side of the road. I show him what we have left: Country Living and the Jarvis Catalogue. "Oh yeah man, thanks, just what I need, alright, absotively, possolutely!" He takes them and I retire to my blankets in the back of the RV with my magazine, as the piano music slows and quiets down. I drift slowly out of the dream, feeling very warm and content, thinking: Ah, what a nice dream. It takes me at least ten minutes to begin laughing. (220 words)

David: teenage dreams:#148 (12/26/98)A baby hangs from a ledge by its fingertips, a lit cigarette hanging from its lips. (16 words)

David: teenage dreams:#149 (12/27/98)I was in school again, in those regimented rows of desks, as the teacher (old P.E. teacher) blabbed on about the usual nothing, and then forced us to take one of those standardized tests. In my dream I resisted everything passively but passionately; I somehow managed to lose my test sheet, for instance. And the whole time I felt that sharp adolescent despair, as of a trapped animal, without even words to express himself. (74 words)

David: teenage dreams:#150 (12/28/98)The town had become this strange peat bog, all hemmed in by mist. At one end was 1st and 2nd street, and right after that came Miramar Avenue, on which was Will's house. I was being chased and I found refuge in Will's house. I kept going into the wrong rooms, though, which were all full of his family members, all sound asleep. Finally I found the right room, with Will and all his friends watching a horror/sci-fi movie. Apparently Will was throwing a publication party: Will had had some long school project to do, and so he had farmed sections of it out to each of his friends, and we all wrote a bit of it. The final thing ended up being like 300 pages. The teacher had thought it was so good he had it published as an anthology! I found my bit in it and read it over. The whole thing was printed in a really cool font, with unique margin illustrations on each page. But the odd thing was, this whole innocuous-sounding dream had a very strong atmosphere of foreboding. (184 words)

David: teenage dreams:#151 (12/29/98)There was a burglar burrowing under the house, preparing to drill a hole through the floor under where we were sleeping. I ran to the phone to dial 911 and Laura and I got in the van to escape. (39 words)

David: teenage dreams:#152 (12/30/98)I was getting a tattoo, or rather I wanted to, but for one thing it cost too much and for another thing all the sample designs were pretty unappealing, childish even. I mean, there was one design that looked exactly like a three-year old's drawing. But while I was in the parlor trying to leave, I struck up a conversation with a man who had a really impressive series of tattoos on his head. He had a shaved head (of course) and he had tattooed a celtic band all the way around the base of his skull. On the back of his head was an *amazing* rendering of Quetzalcoatl, and the rest of his head was covered with intertwining Aztec, Mayan, and Celtic designs, which worked together very well. He seemed to be interested in Mexico so I told him I was going there. He told me that when he went there, he had had a good time, but wherever he went people would just stare and stare and stare at him. He was genuinely puzzled as to why people would do this to him.

David: teenage dreams:#153 (12/31/98)I'm in my mother-in-law's house, but in my dream this is the new house my parents are building. The back room (which connects to a deck) is Nick's room, in the process of construction. Plastic sheeting is hanging everywhere, and the walls are covered with irregularly placed (but identical) splotches of glowing plaster. In an adjoining room is something called a genealogy machine: you place a book of family history open on it and there it does something, God knows what. This is obviously a nod to the presence of my mother. I went out onto the back porch and realized I was being pursued by Richard Madden, a character in Borges' short story 'The Garden of Forking Paths', who is never described apart from his name, and his function: namely, to chase the narrator with a gun. I ran out under the deck and ducked. Now I'm in the side yard and there is a blonde woman on the porch. A man behind her waves and shouts: "Good bye, pa!" There is a limosuine cruising down the road: a window rolls down and the barrell of a shotgun pokes out. The woman is gone and the man who was standing behind her crumbles a head of garlic over the edge. The cloves hit the ground. There is a bang. Richard Madden has killed the woman instead of me. I walk to the gate and across the driveway a very fragile and ancient Hindu man wearing blue earmuffs shuffles by with his eyes closed. (254 words)

David: teenage dreams:#154 (02/27/99)I was laying stretched on the bed in an Aculpulco hotel, staring through a golden light. Suddenly an amazing rainbow colored cat, made out of light, appears. I recognize it as a dream, and it shrieked. Somehow I managed to keep dreaming, and changed the cat into the pretty chambermaid who I'd been looking at for days. We made love, but she kept trying to turn into the cat in a very irritating way. I had to keep concentrating to keep the figure I was making love to focused as the chambermaid. (92 words)

David: teenage dreams:#155 (07/29/99)I was having sex with a woman whose body looked a lot like Laura's, but I couldn't see her face and it definitely wasn't Laura. (25 words)

David: teenage dreams:#156 (09/13/99)There is a dorm. Laughing. Judi is there; so is Cait. Cait whispers something I'm not supposed to tell Judi. She goes away. I talk to Judi and accidentally she figures out what Cait told me. But Judi isn't disturbed. We laugh and lay down together, and continue talking and laughing. (51 words)

David: teenage dreams:#157 (09/14/99)Somebody was telling me that I should hang on to my fortune, rather than spending it all. (17 words)

David: teenage dreams:#158 (09/15/99)The three of us -- Brad, Laura and myself -- go to a local bar. Instead of it being a grungy bar, it is a very nice multicolored restaurant. We sit down to table on a second floor with three young women. One of them works at a nearby cafe, Stella's; the other two I've never seen before. We all order food. Schoenberg's Op. 11 is playing as background music! (70 words)

David: teenage dreams:#159 (09/16/99)I have a gun for self defense. It's a pistol. There's a switch on the side. If I flip it up, it becomes a light, a flashlight. So I can see through the darkness. If I flip it down, it becomes a weapon. I'm travelling through the Schwarzwald and I hear a noise. Quickly I shut off the light and shoot in the direction of the noise. I hear a howling: it was a cat. I flip the light back on: my sister's cat. I've grazed the left side of her face, which is now a raw bloody spot. But her eyes are fine and she's not seriously injured in any way, only frightened and in pain. I try to catch her, which is hard in the dark, but I eventually do and somehow manage to contain the struggling, howling, scratching, biting, hissing, screaming cat until I can take care of her. Meantime I must watch out for the Germans. (160 words)

David: teenage dreams:#160 (09/17/99)Brad is describing a joke that Hannah once played on him. As Brad tells his story, I see what happened. Brad is climbing up a ladder, embracing a gigantic can of Mountain Dew. He reaches the top and I see that he's on top of a pool slide. Right before going down the slide into the pool, he opens the can. But Hannah had set a trap. The can explodes, drenching Brad with Mountain Dew. He looks so pitifully silly that I wake myself up laughing. (86 words)

David: teenage dreams:#161 (09/18/99)Laura gets undressed and takes a shower. The mirrors are placed so that I can watch her from the bed. I watch and jack off. Later, when she's done, we go into the bathroom together; it's hot and steamy. She informs me that she figured out how to get rid of all her excess cynicism. She opened the window and pointed to all the water condensed in the metal grate in the window. "All that represents excess moisture in the atmosphere." She opened the door and turned on a huge standing fan outside the window. The switch is by the bathroom door. The fan begins blowing, spattering us with droplets of water. "That's what I have to do with my excess cynicism." "What," I joke, "spray us with it?" (129 words)

David: teenage dreams:#162 (09/20/99)The movie theater where I work is different, a wierd amalgamation of an old theater in town, the theater I work at now, and an auto mechanic's shop. Josh is working on something in the back room. He was playing music on a CD player, and we debated how these people got famous and why. Josh points out that the guy we're listening to worked here before. I'm not sure whether "here" referred to the actual theater or just crappy jobs like it. Josh takes his paints, his music, and leaves. Unrecognizable people and myself discuss the fact that Josh has left, and we go out into the second lobby. The box office has been moved here for some wierd reason. We hire a new, sexy girl, who looks a lot like Kitty from the Mayan. She also looks like a girl who works in the local copy shop. Her voice is distorted. Laura shows up late, wanting coffee, but it's too late, all the coffee is gone. Laura begins to describe something she dreamt, and the dream is taken over by that for a while. She finishes. I go into the office, which has become a huge garage. All kinds of tough-ass cowboy types from Wyoming are there. These are the friends of Sasha (supervisor). They beat people up for a living. I drive my old van out of the garage, taking an unusual direction, and find myself in fenced-off corner of the railyard. I park the van at the garage's exit and walk out into the railyard among all the crossings, under a mottled brown sky. The ancient station looms in the background, only it's disturbingly spongy. The earth is brown, rocky, and a little spongy. I see a sign on the building: "Warning: Fast Moving Trains." This looks exactly like the signs over the light rail tracks downtown. A man wearing khaki overalls and a khaki shirt and glasses runs out of the garage. He looks a lot like Harold Lloyd, the silent movie genius. He grabs me by the shoulders and pulls me off the track I'm standing on. A moment later a train screams by. I move to a different track but he yanks me off of that one right before another train nearly obliterates me. This time I notice that the trains are made of the same dry, rocky, spongy stuff as the railyard and station. The tracks are iron and wood. I talk to Lloyd as a third train rushes by on a distant track. Is there any way I could take one of these trains to the South part of town? "Sure," he says, "but go to the goddamn station. Your stuff will catch up with you later." Meantime we'd better get off the tracks. He's the switchman, who sends all the trains onto the right tracks, and only he knows the schedule by heart, well enough to avoid getting pulped by a train. "Look, I can't babysit you all goddamn night, so you better get out of the yard or you'll wind up dead before long." I go back to the van and dig through a U-haul box. I take the most important stuff and fill the backpack with it. Then I drive the van into the garage. The garage had changed into more of a parking garage with ramps and levels. But there's still tools and equipment strewn around everywhere. Before it was a very straightforward auto shop with three or four bays; now it's a confusing maze. To further complicated things, they blocked the entrance, making it necessary for me to go in backwards. The mechanics are irritated with me. (611 words)

David: teenage dreams:#163 (09/21/99)There is the theater. A man asks if there is a donut shop nearby and where. I tell him where and he goes. A woman comes by and asks the same question. I lead her halfway there and she goes the rest of the way. Before long I hear her frantic screams for help. I know that the man I talked to earlier is to blame. Swallowing my fear, I run in the direction of her screams, also shouting for help. (81 words)

David: teenage dreams:#164 (09/21/99)There was a nightclub on the penthouse floor of Smith Tower. Everyone called it "The Smith". Brad said that he for one was getting sick of stepping over piles of dried vomit, passed out drunks, and "other excretions" in the elevator every Saturday and Sunday morning, when he went downstairs to buy a paper. From now on he would take the stairs, since he only lived on the third floor, and drunk people never take the stairs. (77 words)

David: teenage dreams:#165 (09/23/99)I'm at the theater to watch "Xiu Xiu" with Laura. Laura goes into the auditorium and I go to the bathroom. The bathroom is an outsized, dirty locker room, a lot like the locker room at the public pool. I have to piss, and wind up peeing in the disused ashtrays. I hear a voice: Judi emerges from a stall. She has obviously been crying. I ask what I can do and we talk for a while. At length we get far friendlier than usual and have a good fuck on the floor. Afterwards I realize that Laura's probably wondering what the hell happened to me. By the clock only ten minutes had passed, but the sex felt too satisfying for it to have been that short. I decide my watch is wrong, and cross into the lobby. (138 words)

David: teenage dreams:#166 (10/08/99)Something about a nude club for teenagers, who are in general better swimmers than those who go to clubs where swimsuits are required. The connection is never explained. The patrons of the nude club are all issued brown towels, hence the nickname of this club, "The Brown Towel". Gah. While at this club I run into Heather. She's older, taller, more slender, has short tousled dishwater blonde hair, and is really desirable. She's basically standoffish towards me. I ask if she's still in magazine work, and she says yes. She's an editor at a small magazine, but soon she's going to move on to something bigger and better. Then she started up a computer and began working on something. I saw her in profile, and she kept changing into a woman with black hair, severely thin, and basically ugly. (139 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0001 (1949-01-19 - Göttingen)Abschrift aus den Tagebuch vom 13.2.1947: Eine merkwürdige Vermischung der Elemente des Unterbewusstseins im Traum. Ich träume oft von ganz bestimmten, mir genau bekannten Menschen, die sich im Traum genau so benehmen, dass ich sie wiedererkennen kann, und wenn ich ihnen in die Augen blicke, haben sie plötzlich ganz andere, fremde Augen und ich bin enttäuscht oder entsetzt. - Vor allem sind es immer wieder Gesichter - und zwar Augenblickseindrücke bestimmter Gesichter, die mir im Traume wieder begegnen, und insofern ist mir der Traum direkt ein nachträglicher Gradmesser für die Intensität, mit der mich ein bestimmter Gesichtsausdruck irgendeines Menschen im Unterbewusstsein beeindruckt hat.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0002 (1949-01-20 - Göttingen)Ich bin in der russischen Zone, in Schwerin (und zwar nicht früher, sondern in der Gegenwart) und gehe die Schlosstrasse hoch. Da komme ich mit zwei Jungen zusammen und gleich ins Gespräch, von denen der eine mir sehr sympathisch ist und durch eine angenehme und freundliche Art und gepflegte Ausdrucksweise mir auffällt, obwohl er noch sehr jung ist. Ich nenne ihn Du, hab nachher aber das Gefühl, ich hätte ihn Sie nennen müssen. Er ist aber in keiner Weise beleidigt. Das gefällt mir besonders gut. - Ich frage ihn, wie ich zum "Grossen Moor" komme (Parallelstrasse zur Schlosstrasse) und ob dort ein Herr von Hartwig wohne. Das "von" habe ich dabei unwillkürlich besonders betont, wie ich merke. Es zeigt sich, dass er genau orientiert ist. Der ist gerade verreist oder etwas ähnliches. Ich frage noch nach anderen Bekannten meines Vaters, denn ich weiss nicht, wo ich übernachten soll - aber er hat bei jedem einen Grund, warum ich da nicht hin kann und sagt, er sähe es als selbstverständlich an, dass ich zunächst bei ihm übernachte. (dies ist die Stelle, wo mir seine gepflegte Sprache auffällt) - und er müsse nur erst seinen Pflegevater fragen. (195 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0003 (1949-01-20 - Göttingen)Ich träumte dann noch irgend etwas Turbulentes, was mit Plünderung und Überfall - ebenfalls in der östlichen Atmosphäre - zu tun hatte, und zuletzt kam auch der Krieg noch zu seinem Recht. Diesmal war es in Wittmoldt, wo der Weg zum Hof über eine schmale Landzunge führt, - auf ihm gehend. Es schoss. Man sah es aufblitzen, hörte es pfeifen, nahm Deckung. Ich lief immer weiter zum Hof hin. Mein Begleiter rief, er wolle bleiben, wo er wäre, die schössen sich auf den Hof ein. Ich hatte den Eindruck, sie schössen sich gerade auf uns ein, schrie "nein", rannte allein weiter, nahm immer Deckung, presste mich ganz platt auf dem Bauch in eine Erdvertiefung, hatte nur den Gedanken, ins Haus zu kommen, in den Keller, zum den anderen Menschen, lieber dort mit denen umzukommen, als hier allein. - Die Schüsse kommen näher. Dann kam einer, der pfiff immerzu. Ich dachte, er würde mich treffen, - und betete - obwohl ich noch dabei überlegte, dass ich das ja lange nicht mehr getan hätte, weil mich der Zweifel, der Gedanke des Anthropomorphismus irgendwie vor dieser Art der Äusserung zurückhielt. Der Gedanke kam mir auch jetzt (oder wenigstens gleich im Erwachen, das darauf folgte), aber ich tat es trotzdem in innerer Angst. - (210 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0004 (1949-01-20 - Göttingen)Dann träumte ich weiter (es kann sein, dass dies die direkte Fortsetzung des Schweriner Traums (2) war): Wir waren viele in einem Keller in der russischen Zone. Margund kam auch. Ich stellte mich erst in den Hintergrund, um mich nicht vorzudrängen, sie zu begrüssen. Sie setzte sich auf eine Bank an der Wand zwischen andere. Ich konnte sie nicht entdecken. Sie hatte einen braunen Hut tief ins Gesicht gezogen. Ich beugte die Knie, dass ich ihr in die Augen kucken konnte, und erkannte sie sofort. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0005 (1949-01-20 - Göttingen)Letzter Traum heute Nacht: Ich war im Schuhgeschäft, um Schuhe zu kaufen, - sagte dem Mann, ich habe wenig Geld. Er zeigte mir ein Bord: "Kaufen Sie diese, die sind am billigsten zu haben". Dort lagen alte gebrauchte Turnschuhe. Ich probierte ein Paar an. Sie waren weiss und sehr bequem. [Aber unter der Sohle war eine Aber eine darin] (Diese Worte sind im Manuskript gestrichen). Aber die Sohle war kaputt. Aber es war nur eine Art Filz, der unter der eigentlichen Sohle angebracht war und den man ohne Schaden für die Schuhe hätte ganz entfernen können. Ich überlegte lange, als ich die Schuhe anprobiert hatte und in ihnen auf und ab ging, ob ich sie nehmen sollte. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0006 (1949-01-21 - Göttingen)Ich will in eine Vorlesung gehen, die ich sonst nicht höre, um Dorothea H. zu sehen, von der ich weiss, dass sie dort hingeht. Eberhard P. sagt mir: "Diesmal kommt sie schon um dreiviertel, um noch Arbeiten durchzusehen". ich wundere mich, dass sie so etwas tut, sich also wissenschaftlich beschäftigt. - Ich bin in die Vorlesung gegangen. Der Hörsaal ist voll. Ich sitze mit anderen auf dem Tisch vor der ersten Sitzreihe. H. sitzt dort und unterhält sich mit Verschiedenen. Ich kann sie aber nicht richtig zu Gesicht bekommen. Die Vorlesung beginnt. Hinter mir, in der ersten Reihe, sind noch Plätze frei. Ich lasse mich auf einen der Sitze zurückgleiten. Plötzlich ist keiner mehr frei, und ich sitze sozusagen zwischen den Stühlen. Man schimpft. Ich steige wieder nach vorne auf den Tisch (der ja im Mineralogischen Institut, um das es sich handelt, ähnlich wie eine lange Bank die letzte Sitzreihe zum Podium hin abschliesst). Als ich mich dahin setzen will, wo ich vorher sass, heisst es: das ist ja nicht Ihr Platz: Sie sitzen doch da. - Man zeigt irgendwo nach weiter rechts, wo ich nie gesessen hab. Ich kucke dahin mit einer Gebärde des Befremdens und bleibe ruhig sitzen, wo ich hingehöre. Da erhebt sich ein furchtbares Gezeter. Das ganze Auditorium gerät in Aufregung. Der Professor kommt vom Katheder auf mich zu. Ich will ihm entwas entgegnen. Aber er lässt mich gar nicht zu Worte kommen, sondern mit einer etwas spöttischen Miene sagt er: Da vorne (d.i. neben dem Katheder) ist noch ein Stuhl. Ich gehe mit ihm dorthin. Er weist mir einen Stuhl. Ich sage: nein, dieser ist bequemer und setze mich auf den bequemsten mit Seitenlehnen, strecke die Beine aus und mache es mir mit einem gewissen Trotz so bequem wie möglich. Während er später etwas an der Tafel erklärt, denke ich: eigentlich müsste man aus Protest jetzt raus gehen - aber ich tue es nicht, damit es nicht wie ein Weglaufen aus Angst aussieht. - Eine Viertelstunde später fluten viel zu spät Kommende von hinten in den Hörsaal. Man rückt in den Bankreihen zusammen, und sie bekommen alle noch Platz, während ich hier vorne vor den Augen aller mitten auf dem Podium sitze. - Ich suche mit den Augen H. in der ersten Reihe, entdecke sie dort etwas ungenau aus der Ferne und werfe ihr einen triumphierenden Blick zu und gebe mir auf meinem Stuhl einen Ruck, um einen guten Eindruck zu machen. - (408 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0007 (1949-01-21 - Göttingen)Ich laufe nur mit einem Handtuch bekleidet über die Strasse und suche den Eingang zu meiner Wohnung, aber kann ihn plötzlich nicht finden. Schliesslich habe ich ihn. Ich wohne hinter einem Friseurladen. Der Mann ist furchtbar nett und hilfsbereit zu mir. Ich habe einen Kasten für Haferflocken. Der ist kaputt. Der Mann nagelt ihn mir wieder zusammen. Der Hausmeister vom mineralogischen Institut hilft dabei. - Ich sitze und habe zwei Aluminiumtöpfe mit Essenresten von Speisungen. Ich schütte sie beide zusammen, aber der eine war salzig, der andere süss. Ich esse. Da merke ich, dass mir gegenüber Nicolai Hartmann sitzt. Er sagt sehr freundlich zu mir: "Na schmeckt denn das, was Sie da eben gemischt haben." Ich sage: "Na ja, es geht so" - und nach einer Pause, als mir einfällt, dass ich das vergessen habe "Danke". - (137 words)

Ich kann drinnen einen jüngeren Mann mit einer Brille sehen, von dem ich annehme, dass er sie besucht. Ich kehre schnell um, schleiche aus der offenen Wohnungstür, renne die Treppe runter und laufe unten möglichst leise und schnell unter ihrem Fenster vorbei, um nicht gesehen zu werden. - (88 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0010 (1949-01-21 - Göttingen)von vor einem halben Jahr, notiert ebenfalls 21.1.1949: 

Ich bin in unserer Stube mit mehreren Jungen und Mädchen zusammen, mit denen wir am Tag zuvor auf einem sehr netten Fest waren. Plötzlich kracht es furchtbar wie von einer Explosiun. Ich nehme sofort Deckung und krieche flach auf dem Bauch unter meine Couch, auf der eine leuchtend rote Decke liegt. Den anderen rate ich dasselbe, und sie nehmen auch irgendwie Deckung. Nachdem ich eine unbestimmte Weile nichts Bestimmtes erlebt habe, sehe ich meinen Bruder in seinem Bett sich hoch aufrichten - er hat ein weisses Nachthemd an, von dem seine dunklen, im Bett wüsten Haare sich krass abheben, er hält die geballte Faust hoch und wirft etwas auf mich, ich warte, bis es auf mich runterprasselt - : und es fallen lauter - Bonbons auf mich, kleine ostereierartige Fondants. Davon wache ich auf und spüre noch ein Zucken in den Augen und in der Nase und fühle mich sehr mitgenommen. (159 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0011 (1949-01-23 - Göttingen)Ich bin in einem grossen Hause in einer Art Gemeinschaftslager. Es sind schon drei ums Leben gekommen - ich glaube aus Hunger oder irgend einem Unglück -. Sie liegen nebeneinander auf dem Dachboden des Hauses. - Ich gehe das Treppenhaus hoch. (Es ist das Treppenhaus des theolog. Seminars). Dort herrrscht Trubel. Eine Art varietéförmige Aufführung. Ich höre einige Stimmen irgend ein Operettenlied singen. Mein Bruder steht auch da. Er hat nur eine kurze Unterhose und eine Art Turnhemd an, aber eine grosse Fliege umgebunden. Ich finde das unmöglich. Er erzählt begeistert von der Aufführung, sagt aber: sie haben etwas gemacht, was sie nicht dürfen. Ich sehe auch alle betroffen neugierig dastehen. Ein Mann wird die Treppe heraufgetragen. Er liegt auf einer Bahre. Alles steht und gafft. Nirgend kommt man weiter. Ich bin sehr ungehalten und sage zu den Leuten einen Goethe'schen Vers, der mir jetzt entfallen ist und mit den Worten endete "nun geht doch weiter". Sie lassen mich vorbei. Ich sage: Wie kann man nur so rumstehen, wenn einer sich bloss die Hose voll gemacht hat. - Da merke ich, dass der Mann auf der Bahre tot ist und ich mich geirrt habe. Ich bin ganz erschüttert und es sagt in mir "O Gott". Stirn und Haare und die Füsse der Leiche kucken unter der Decke raus. Sie wird neben den drei anderen auf dem Dachboden niedergesetzt. ... Wir sitzen alle in irgendwie innerlich und organisationsmässig zusammengehörigen kleinen Gruppen auf den Tischen. Schäder sagt ein Wort zu unserer kleinen Gruppe - oder lese ich es eigentlich geschrieben wie in einer kleinen Denkschrift von ihm an die Theologen. Den Wortlaut habe ich vergessen, aber es schloss mit den Worten: "die nicht waren, was sie sein sollten" und enthält eine ernste Mahnung, die mich sehr beschäftigt. - (296 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0012 (1949-01-25 - Göttingen)Erster Traum: Ich komme in das Schulgebäude in Schwerin, um ein Hemd zu holen, das ich dort vor Jahren vergessen habe. Es hängt noch an derselben Stelle auf der Kleiderablage draussen auf dem Flur zwischen Sachen der jetztigen Schüler. Ich sehe es auf Anhieb, nehme es, gehe in die Klasse, in der gerade Unterricht ist, um es dem Lehrer vorzuzeigen. Dieser erkennt mich noch. Er ist sehr höflich. Ich sage: Ich wollte Ihnen das Hemd noch erst zeigen, um es nicht so sang- und klanglos verschwinden zu lassen. Er begleitet mich noch vor die Türe und verabschiedet sich sehr höflich. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0013 (1949-01-25 - Göttingen)Ich bin in einem Haus an der Meeresküste. Ich habe mir das Knie verletzt und suche nach Hilfe. Zum Fenster raussehend, sehe ich auf das Meer direkt unter mir. Ich winke mit einer weissen Mullbinde, die am Bein befestigt ist, hinaus. Sofort tauchen einige schnellbootförmige Fahrzeuge U-Bootartig aus dem Wasser auf. Jemand sagt: das sind die Kreuzer. Ich bin Marineoffizier und finde nichts dabei, dass sie mir zur Hilfe kommen. Sie steuern auf das Ufer zu. Die Leute springen mit Uniform und Stahlhelm ins Wasser und schwimmen ans Land. Ich habe noch das Gefühl, dass es doch wohl etwas viel Aufwand für meine kleine Verletzung am Knie sei. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0014 (1949-01-25 - Göttingen)Ich wandere in einer bergigen Landschaft. Auf einer Höhe komme ich an einer Hütte vorbei, die offenbar neben einem Abgrund steht, in den schon mal Menschen abgestürzt sind, denn ich sehe zwei Kreuze neben der Hütte. Als ich näher hingehe, werden es mehrere verschiedengestaltige, darunter auch zwei kleine eiserne. Ich denke: die müssen wohl zu zwei kleinen Kindern gehören, die damals abgestürzt sind. (63 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0015 (1949-01-26 - Göttingen)Ich treffe Eberhard. Er bringt eine Kollegin nach Hause. Wir wollen in die Turnhalle gehen. Dazu müssen wir über den Zaun. Sie läuft und springt rüber. Eberhard und ich klettern hinterher. In der Halle sind Kaffeetafeln aufgestellt. Die Sportstudenten haben ein Fest. Ich sehe Herrn P. dort sitzen, der zu diesen gehört. - Ich frage Eberhard: Was willst du gerade mit dieser? Er sagt oder deutet an, er habe sie zum Theologen-Fest eingeladen. Er hat irgendwelche diplomatischen Gründe dafür. Ich suche Margund. Schliesslich finde ich sie. Sie sagt schon im voraus zu allem, was ich mir ihr verabreden will: Ich habe keine Zeit: Mittwoch nicht, Donnerstag nicht, Freitag nicht, - - und Sonnabend in acht Tagen fahre ich vielleicht nach Hause. Ich sage sehr leise, damit es die anderen nicht hören: "Da ist aber das Theologen-Fest. "- Sie: "ja, das weiss ich noch nicht." Ich: Aber dann sagen Sie mir es bitte bald, sehr bald, sonst bin ich aufgeschmissen. Ich will sagen: dann gehe ich mit jemand anderem hin, verbessere mich aber in Gedanken schnell und sage: dann gehe ich auch nicht hin. - Ich schaue auf den Ausdruck der Augen während des Gespräches. Sie haben etwas Spontanes und doch zugleich Kühles. (202 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0016 (1949-01-26 - Göttingen)Zweiter Traum.

Mix sagt: "den essen wir nicht" und bittet heimlich Tante Pinchen, schnell richtiges Sauerkraut zu kochen. (61 words)

Ich merke aus seiner Schilderung gleich, dass es nichts taugt, und mache die Einwende, die ich schon schriftlich gemacht habe. Ich könne mir nur das Zimmer undverbindlich mal ansehen. Zum Schluss sage ich ihm: "Nun habe ich Ihren Namen schon wieder vergessen." Er antwortet: "Jetzt sage ich ihn nicht noch mal". Ich rate noch etwas herum. Die Leute, die neben mir stehen, machen allerhand Vorschläge, wie er heissen könnte. Diese sind alle verschieden. Ich überlege, dass ich ihn dann sicher nächstes Mal falsch anreden werde.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0024 (1949-03-04 - Göttingen)Ich gehe auf einem Abendspaziergang den Nikolausberger-Weg hinunter; an der Strassenecke begegnen mir Fräulein Höhndorf und Fräulein Siem. Sie gehen auch spazieren. Fräulein Höhndorf tritt gleich auf mich zu; in ihrer energisch hilfsbereiten Art redet sie mich gleich an. Fräulein Siem steht ruhig und noch zurückhaltend daneben, gibt dem Gespräch nur durch einige kleine, manchmal scharfe Bemerkungen lächelnd ihre Note. Höhndorf fragt irgend etwas, ob ich auch meinen Spaziergang mache, und ich antworte entsprechend, wie schön das ist, und sage wohl auch irgend etwas von Sport und Schwimmen. Den näheren Inhalt unserer Sätze habe ich jetzt vergessen. - Aber Fräulein Siems kleine Bemerkung habe ich nicht vergessen. Sie sagt bloss: "Ich schwimme aber nicht gleich bis zum Stadtbad und zurück". - Dann gehen wir jeder in seiner Richtung weiter und ich biege in die Hanssen-Strasse ein. Als ich noch nicht weit gegangen bin, höre ich hinten einige polternde Schritte und wie Fräulein Siem und Fräulein Höhndorf jemand anders begrüssen. Ich denke, dass könnte Krischan (Christian) sein. Bald kommen denn auch die Schritte kräftig hinter mir her und ich gehe langsam und verhalten, um abzuwarten. Als er mir begegnet, sagt Krischan:"Ho!, schon meilenweit kann man Dich an Deinem Gang erkennen -", und ich schon im selben Atemzug:"Als ich dahinten die polternden Schritte hörte, wusste ich schon, dass du es sein musstest". - Das war also die erste Begegnung nach längerem Getrenntsein. Dann gingen wir nebeneinander her und es entstand eine Pause. Ich dachte schon halb im Erwachen - 'ach, hättest du den Brief noch nicht abgeschickt, wo die Papiere drin sind, die Krischan jetzt braucht;' und dann fiel mir ein 'Ach ich hab ihn ja noch in der Tasche'.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0025 (1949-03-05 - Göttingen)Ich gehe durch eine Villenstrasse auf dem Bürgersteig. Plötzlich fühle ich mich ganz energisch am rechten Arm und an der Hand ergriffen. Ich hatte die Augen im Gehen geschlossen und, als ich sie aufmache, merke ich, dass ich unmittelbar vor einer grossen, rechteckigen Öffnung im Boden stehe, an deren dunkelm Grund ich elektrische Schaltanlagen sehe - offenbar irgendeine unterirdische Anlage, ähnlich wie die Kanalisationen von oben zugänglich, deren Deckel man geöffnet hatte. - Mein erster Gedanke ist, dass es irgendein, auf der Strasse spielendes Kind sein müsse, das mich im letzten Augenblick festgehalten hat -. - Im Erwachen merke ich, dass ich auf meinem Bett liege und jemand neben mir liegt, der meine Rechte gefasst hält. Ich wage nicht, mich umzusehen und will fragen: "Wer ist da?", aber die Stimme versagt mir und ich drücke nur fest die fremde Hand. Als ich die Augen gewaltsam aufreisse, sehe ich -: das schwarze Loch, über dem ich stand, ist die dunkle Seitenwand eines Schrankes, die sich senkrecht am Fussende meines Bettes aufrichtet. Die ganze Lage war also in dem Traum um 90 Grad gedeht: Der senkrechte Schrank: waagerecht. Meine waagerechte Lage mit geschlossenen Augen: ein aufrechtes Gehen mit geschlossenen Augen. Das helle Bild an der Wand des dunklen Schrankes waren die elektrischen Geräte in dem dunklen Loch. Die Hand, die meine Rechte fest gefasst hielt, war meine eigene Linke, die im Schlaf in der Rechten gelegen hatte und die ich im Erwachen, in der Meinung, es sei die Hand eines Unbekannten, neben mir Liegenden, ganz fest gedrückt hatte. Ich lag nach diesem Erwachen noch eine Zeitlang wie gelähmt auf dem Bett, auf das ich mich zu einem kurzen Nachmittagsschlaf gelegt hatte. Das Beängstigende in diesem Traum lag darin, dass auch im Erwachen seine Realität nicht aufhörte. (294 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0026 (1949-03-06 - Göttingen)Auf einem Platz in der Stadt. Es sind mehrere Autounfälle passiert. In welche Richtung ich auch schaue, liegen die Leichen der Verunglückten, schrecklich entstellt. Ich will mich zwingen, nicht wegzusehen, denn ich habe den Gedanken, das Ertragen solchen Anblicks lernen zu müssen, denn es könnten ja auch einmal solche Menschen nur verletzt sein und ich ihnen helfen müssen. Aber ich halte es nicht mehr aus und ergreife die Flucht. - - Ich komme mit einem Gerichtsmediziner in ein Institut, wo die Köpfe der Verunglückten ausgestellt sind. Wir betrachten den Kopf eines Mannes, dessen Unfall mit einer von ihm verübten verbrecherischen Tat zusammenhängt. Er sieht merkwürdig frisch aus. Wie ich mich auch stelle, werfe ich Schatten auf den Kopf, da das Licht von mehreren Lampen kommt. Endlich bin ich so zurückgetreten, dass der Kopf frei beleuchtet ist, und mein Begleiter ihn richtig betrachten kann. Er misst die Gesichtsproportionen mit der Handspanne. Der Kopf ist am Halse abgehackt und auf einem kleinen Sockel befestigt. Ich merke, wie der Mund sich bewegt. Ich sage:"Einen merkwürdigen Ausdruck hat der Mann. So trübe und irgendwie gleichgültig. - Die Augen sind ja überhaupt offen!" Da merke ich, wie die Augen sich bewegen und mich gross anschauen. Mir wird schwindlig. Ich sage zu Emmi, die auch im Raum steht, und meinem Begleiter, der inzwischen Vaters Züge angenommen hat:"Mir ist nicht gut. Ich möchte rausgehen, aber bleibt bitte ruhig drin und lasst Euch nicht stören". Sie begleiten mich sofort nach draussen ins Freie. Ich sage, dass ich nun per Anhalter über Berlin weiterfahren wollte zu meinem Wohnsitz in München. Aber sie sagen: "Du bleibst selbstverständlich hier" und wollen mich pflegen. Wir hatten schon vorher über diese Reise gesprochen, und ich hatte da gesagt: " Ich fahre auf keinem Fall per Auto bei dieser Glätte, bei der es so viele Unfälle gibt". Sie nehmen mich in ihre Hut und ich erwache. (312 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0027 (1949-03-08 - Göttingen)Ich fahre mit einem Pferdewagen durch einen Koppelweg. Rechts und links sind Zäune. Dann muss ich nach links einbiegen und über die Koppel durch eine Mulde, die unter Wasser steht. Vor mir sind noch zwei andere, ebenfalls zweispännige Kastenwagen. Links neben mir verschwindet der Zaun im Wasser. Der Knecht vor mir biegt ein. Ich lenke ebenfalls nach links und sage noch im letzten Moment "Halt", weil ich denke, die Pferde müssen sich im Zaun verfangen, aber es geht glatt weiter. Dann wird das Wasser immer tiefer und geht bis über die Köpfe der Pferde. Der Knecht vor mir sagt: "Bleib oben, mein Pferdchen", damit sich die Tiere im Wasser nicht hinlegen. Ich sage automatisch zu meinen Pferden das selbe. Ich bin im Wagen aufgestanden und ziehe die Zügel krampfhaft hoch. Dabei merke ich, dass sie sich verwirrt haben und muss erst suchen, dass ich die beiden richtigen Leinen richtig gefasst kriege. Die Pferde tauchen wieder aus dem Wasser auf und dann geht es befreiend bergauf. Wir müssen nun nach rechts über einen zweiten Koppelzaun, um aus dem Wasser herauszukommen. Der erste Wagen steht schon an der Durchgangsstelle. Weil die Pferde aus dem tiefen Wasser zu schnell bergauf gegangen sind, stehen die Wagen nun dicht nebeneinander. Der Knecht ruft mir zu:"Du musst weiter nach links halten." - Ich sehe noch das Bild, die sechs braunen Pferde ganz plastisch nebeneinander, die Unterkörper noch im Wasser. Ich sah sie von oben, weil ich noch in meinem Wagen aufrecht stand. - Dann wurde auch die zweite Durchfahrt aus der Koppel heraus überwunden und der Weg führte weiter geradeaus. (264 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0030 (1949-03-09 - Göttingen)Ich gehe durch die Stadt. Vor einem grossen Warenhaus begegnet mir eine modisch gekleidete Frau mit schwarzen Haaren, die aussieht wie eine Pariserin. Sie drängt sich mir in furchtbarer Weise auf und verfolgt mich so, dass ich schliesslich die Flucht ergreife und in ein Haus laufe. Ich komme in ein Zimmer und schliesse in grosser Hast die Tür hinter mir zu. Nach dem ersten Umschliessen des Schlüssels ist die Tür noch offen, erst nach dem zweiten Mal ist sie endlich sicher verschlossen. Ich stehe drinnen in zitternder Angst. Ich bin in das Zimmer eines Mädchens gekommen. Nach einer Weile kommt ein Herr, der sehr verwundert ist, mich in dem Zimmer zu finden, bald darauf das Mädchen selber. Es beruhigt mich in liebevoller, fast mütterlicher Art, so dass ich wieder innerlich frei werde. Dann wandelt sich die Situation. Das Erlebnis verwandelt sich in der Erinnerung in einen Kampf mit Tigern, den ich ausführen musste in einem Film, in dem ich eine Rolle zu spielen hatte. Ich habe den Titel des Films vergessen und suchte nach ihm auf einem Reklameplakat, auf dem die Tiger abgebildet sind. - (185 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0033 (1949-03-11 - Göttingen)Ich bin mit Krischan (Christian) auf einem Reitplatz. Wir lernen dort reiten. Auch eine ältere Damen sehe ich beim Reiten. Dann kommt Christians Mutter. Wir reden ihr gut zu, auch mitzureiten, und sie tut es. Ich muss nun zugucken, weil ein Pferd zu wenig ist. Wir sind eine kleine Treppe hochgegangen, die von unten, wie eine Kellertreppe, auf den Platz führt. Auf der stehe ich nun und muss mich vorsehen, dass mir die Pferde nicht von oben auf den Kopf treten. Dann kommt irgendeine Übung, die nur alle die mitreiten dürfen, die Stuten haben. Der Reitplatz ist mit Rasen bewachsen und liegt inmitten von grünen Koppeln, von denen er durch einen einfachen Koppelzaun getrennt ist. Die Pferde werden nun in eine der Nachbarkoppeln gelassen. Dort gehen auch die anderen alle hin. Nur der Reitlehrer und ich bleiben auf dem Platz zurück. Mit einem Mal kommt das Schönste der Pferde von weitem angaloppiert, um über das Tor in die Reitbahn zurückzuspringen. Dabei verfängt es sich und bleibt mit beiden Hinterbeinen im Tor hängen. Von drüben rufen alle entsetzt "das Tor, das Tor". Der Reitlehrer entfernt vorsichtig die eine Stange - ich denke noch einen Moment, ob ich ihm helfen soll, habe dann aber das Gefühl, dass ich dabei nur im Wege wäre. - Das Pferd befreit sich langsam. Es ist völlig in Schweiss gebadet - aber es bewegt sich mit ruhigen Schritten weiter. Alles atmet befreit auf. Dann geht das Tier zur anderen Seite der Bahn, um dort schon wieder über den Zaun zu springen, weil dort jenseits auf der Koppel eine grosse, wollige Schafherde weidet. Aber der Reitlehrer macht schnell einen lockenden Ruf, so dass die ganze Schafherde herankommt und das Pferd nicht über den Zaun zu springen braucht. Nun werden auch die anderen Pferde hereingelassen und stehen alle am Zaun bei den Schafen. Da kommt von Ferne auf der anderen Koppel eine Kuhherde heran und Gisela sagt: "Wie schade, dass wir die nicht auch noch hereinlassen können". Sie stellt sich das so vor, wie in dem paradiesischen Endzustand bei Jesaja, wo alle Tiere friedlich beieinander sind. 

- Ich darf nun noch ein besonders schönes Pferd aussuchen, um noch einmal zu reiten, weil ich vorhin zu kurz gekommen bin. Im Galoppieren wache ich allmählich auf, aber beschäftige mich im Halbwachen noch eine Weile mit dem Reiten. (386 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0034 (1949-03-12 - Göttingen)Physiologieunterricht bei einem berühmten Professor, dessen Namen ich nicht behalten kann. Er geht mit uns im Schlossgarten spazieren. Dort ist ein neuer Gärtner. Endlich ist der Rasen wieder richtig gepflegt. Dann lehnen wir an dem Geländer an einer Brücke. Es sind jetzt ausser mir nur noch zwei Studenten bei dem Professor. Er malt dem einen mit seinem Federhalter blaue Striche und Figuren auf seinen Anzug, so dass der bald sehr lustig aussieht: Ich denke, das ist eigentlich doch etwas merkwürdig, - aber als Physiologie muss der Mann ja wissen, ob man so etwas wieder abkriegt. Inzwischen begegnet uns Professor Pohl. Mein Lehrer redet ihn mit Namen an, aber sein eigener Name fällt leider nicht im Gespräch. - 

Der eine Student ist fortgegangen in den Schlossgarten. Wir gehen hinterher. Er geht dort auf den Rasen, um sich einen vom Baum gefallenen Apfel zu holen. Aber der neue Gärtner hält sich einen Hund, der nun sofort auf den Delinquenten loskommt. Dieser wirft den Apfel vor Schreck in die Luft, dass er mir vor die Füsse fällt. Der Hund denkt, ich bin's gewesen, und will mich in die Hand beissen. Ich halte ihm krampfhaft die Kinnladen auseinander. So geht es eine ganze Weile. Niemand kommt mir zu Hilfe. Ich schaue dem Hund in die Augen, aber der ist nur darauf aus, mich zu beissen. Ich rufe alle Leute um Hilfe an und bitte sie, den Gärtner zu holen, damit er seinen Hund von mir abrufen kann. Aber die zucken alle nur mit den Achseln. Es geht sie nichts an. - Als ich die Zähne des Hundes, die sich schon tief in meine Finger eingebohrt haben, beinahe nicht mehr auseinanderhalten kann und schon die Hoffnung aufgebe, wache ich auf.

Beim ersten Mal gelingt mir das gar nicht, als ich jedoch näher zusehe, und jede einzeln betaste, ob sie Dornen hat, und an jeder rieche, kann ich sie alle richtig benennen. Es sind auch unechte Rosen darunter, die jedesmal, wenn ich an ihnen rieche, eine Enttäuschung sind.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0036 (1949-03-13 - Göttingen)Ich gehe durch die Strasse. Plötzlich kommt mir ein Traberwagen entgegen. Er fährt so schnell, dass man ihn nur unscharf erkennen kann. Während ich ihm noch nachschaue, kommt schon ein zweiter und ich begreife, dass es sich hier um ein Rennen handelt. Da kommt dazwischen ein Lastauto in grossem Tempo. Ich fürchte einen Zusammenstoss. Dann höre ich die Kinder "Ari, Ari" schreien. (d.h. Artillerie). Ich meine, die Umrisse von Protze und Geschütz wahrnemen zu können. Dann rufen die Kinder "Da kommt die Preussische Wehrmacht mit einer Fahne". Das ist etwas unerhörtes in dieser Zeit und klingt wie ein Fanfarenruf. (Im Erwachen höre ich draussen Kinder rufen. Ich liege auf meinem Bett und habe doch das Gefühl, nun zu sitzen. Es ist alles noch wie in der Schwebe und ich muss mir erst einen Stoss geben, aufzustehen. Auch die Bilder des Traums haben noch diese allgemeine Vieldeutigkeit und erst eine scharf erinnernde Besinnung bringt sie in feste Umrisse.) (157 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0037 (1949-03-14 - Göttingen)Ich sitze mit Professor von Rad und seiner Frau und Kind auf einer Schwebebahn, die nur aus einem einzigen Brett besteht, das frei an einem Seil hängt. Das Seil ist neben uns an einem Kirchturm befestigt. Sie sagen mir entsetzt, dass ich reitend auf dem Brett sitzen müsse und nicht im gewöhnlichen Sitz. Da bewegt sich das Brett schon und ich kann mich nur mit äusserster Mühe halten. Emmi sitzt auch mit auf dem Brett und stürzt beinahe ab. Wir hängen alle mit den Köpfen nach unten. Ich muss sie halten. - Szenenwechsel: Von der Bahn ist jetzt nur noch ein Seil übrig geblieben. Ich bin mit einem Kameraden hinaufgeklettert und wir hängen unmittelbar unterhalb der Brüstung des Turmes. Es entspinnt sich folgendes Gespräch: "Früher führte zu jedem Turm ein solcher Aufzug hinauf", sagt mein Partner. "Im Michel ist noch heute ein solcher", ist meine Antwort. - Er: "Heute unterhält man sie nicht mehr. Sie sind überall verfallen. Dieser Strick ist noch das Überbleibsel davon." - Wir hängen immer noch an dem Seil. Ich kann mich kaum mehr halten. Wir haben eine Kinderleiche bei uns und fragen die Pförtnersfrau, ob sie sie annehmen will. Mein Freund belehrt mich, der ich es nicht glauben will, wie viel dies noch vorkommt, wie viele Kinder von ihren Müttern ums Leben gebracht werden. - Die Frau fragt: "Ist es das erste Kind?" Ich weiss mit unfehlbarer Sicherheit, dass sie es nehmen wird, denn es ist das erste Kind. Diese Sitte, wenigstens ein Kind nicht unbegragen zu lassen, entspricht einer alten, in ihrer Klarheit durchsichtigen religiösen Gewohnheit. Ich kann mich kaum mehr halten und möchte sie zu einer schnellen Entscheidung drängen, aber die Sorge um das Kind verbietet es mir, obwohl ich beinahe abstürzen muss. Nach kurzer Besinnung beantwortet die Frau unsere Frage mit den Worten: "Geben Sie es her" und wir schwingen das Paket über die Brüstung. Ich wundere mich, dass alle anderen Geschwister eines solchen Kindes aus ärmster und verkommener Familie dann unbegraben bleiben werden, und erschaudere von dieser grausigen Konsequenz. - Szenenwechsel: Ich bin in einer Irrenanstalt, meine Cousine ist dort als Pflegerin und hat einige Patienten irgendwo hin zu bringen. Ein Mann sitzt rückwärts auf einem Rollstuhl und wird gezogen. Er aber will sich selber helfen, springt runter und versucht, indem er rückwärts geht, den Stuhl mitzuschieben. Als ihm das nicht gelingt, denn der Stuhl läuft immer schneller, rast er in irrem Tempo rückwärts weiter hinterher, bis er aus der Bahn gerät, in die Irre torkelt und mich dabei zu überrennen droht. Ich weiche entsetzt zur Seite. - Wir begleiten jetzt ein schwachsinniges Mädchen. Es hat einen Teller in der Hand, den es mit dem Druck der Finger zu Scherben zerbricht. Ich habe grosse Angst, dabei verletzt zu werden, aber ich lege ihr die Hand auf die Schulter und versuche, ihr zu helfen. Wir sitzen auf einer Böschung am Rande der Anstalt. Nun soll der Weg beginnen. Sie will sofort quer über die Strasse und ins Wasser gehen, denn auf der anderen Seite ist ein See. Es gelingt mir, sie von der besseren Richtung zu überzeugen. Nur bin ich ihr dabei so nahe gekommen, dass ich mich nun kaum von ihr lösen kann. Sie will mich umarmen und nur mit äusserster Gewalt kann ich mich befreien. (Es ist die selbe Situation wie bei dem Traum mit der Pariserin, nur mit einer Note tieferen Mitleidens.) Die Szene wechselt: Ich gehe durch eine enge Gasse. Jetzt sind es Pferde, die mich bedrängen. Diese Szene hat sich unmittelbar aus der vorigen ergeben. Sie kommen in beängstigender Enge von hinten an mir vorbei. Mehrmals hintereinander. Dann zwei Gefährte, von entgegengesetzter Seite zu gleicher Zeit, die sich in dieser Enge nie begegnen können. Ich stelle mich dem einen Gespann entgegen. Aber sie können beide ihre Geschwindigkeit nicht mehr bremsen und prasseln aufeinander. Ich springe im letzten Moment auf die Schwelle einer Haustür und fasse an die Klinke. Die Tür ist verschlossen. Ich drücke eine Klingel, die ich dort entdecken, mit dem Schild: "für sowieso mittlere Klingel benützen", obgleich nur eine Klingel dort ist. Ich höre kein Klingelzeichen nach hier draussen dringen. Ich bin nun in äusserster Bedrängnis, denn jeden Moment kann eins der Pferde mit den Hufen nach mir ausschlagen. (Im Erwachen variiert sich der Gadanke folgendermassen: Ein Mann kommt mit seinem Fuhrwerk von hinten und kann nicht an mir vorbeifahren, denn er weiss, dass seine Pferde schlagen werden. Aber er wartet diszipliniert, bis ich in das Haus eingelassen werde. Mein nächster Gedanke ist: Du hast wieder von Pferden geträumt, dann eröffnen sich wie neue Perspektiven nacheinander rückwärts: zunächst der vorhergehende Abschnitt des Traums, dann alle weiteren in einer unbestimmten, dämmerhaften Ferne und ich weiss, dass er auch noch weiter zurückreicht, als ich ihn jetzt verfolgt habe. (Ich war mit meinem Bruder in einem Gemeindesaal und wollte einen Turm besteigen, vor dem er aber Angst hatte.) Dann springe ich auf und schalte das Licht ein. In diesem Augenblick brauche ich eine gewaltsame Konzentration, um nicht alle Bilder zu vergessen. Einzelne Gespräche und Gedanken muss ich nachträglich fast rekonstruieren.) (842 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0038 (1949-03-16 - Göttingen)Nicolai Hartmann soll einen Vortrag halten. Der Saal ist ungeheuer überfüllt und die Luft kaum erträglich. Er kommt sehr langsam herein und sagt einige leise Worte, dass man in einen andern Saal gehen könnte. Als noch alles durcheinander redet, ruft er ihnen mit lauter Stimme zu: "Guten Morgen, meine Herren" und erklärt dann noch einmal, man solle unauffällig und in kleinen Grüppchen in den anderen Saal gehen - möglichst auf verschiedenen Wegen. Es ist nämlich Krieg. Draussen ist es finster. Ich bin völlig desorientiert und rufe einen anderen Menschen an, er möge mich mitnehmen, ich sei nachtblind. In dem anderen Saal ist ein ziemliches Durcheinander. Ich habe eine Tasche, die ich in dem laubenartigen Vorderbau zu verstecken suche, obwohl sie mir nicht gehört. - Später, auf einem Marsch, fragt mich der Besitzer der Tasche nach ihr. Wir müssen uns nun - wieder des nachts - auf den Weg machen, in das kleine Dorf, in dem der Saal gelegen war, um die Tasche zu suchen. Die Häuser sehen in der Dämmerung einander sehr ähnlich. Darum steure ich zunächst auf ein falsches zu, an dem ich einen laubenartigen Vorbau erblickt habe. Die Einwohner treten uns entgegen und sind sehr misstrauisch und hinterhältig. Wir sind in einer Partisanengegend. Auf dem Weg, der uns nun in das gesuchte Gebäude führen soll, treten uns wieder Einheimische entgegen und versuchen, uns hinzuhalten. Mein Partner kehrt um, um sein Gewehr zu holen. Auf dem Rückweg wendet er sich noch einmal und macht eine wurfartige Bewegung, als ob er eine Handgranate werfen wolle, auf mich und die Leute zu. Neben uns explodieren kleine Böhnchen, die den Leuten grossen Eindruck machen, die ich aber sofort als völlig ungefährlich erkenne. - Als er zurückkommt, das Gewehr umgehängt, sage ich: "Kannst du überhaupt schiessen, die Feder zu deinem Gewehr ist doch in der Tasche, die wir suchen?" Er bestätigt meine Befürchtung und wir machen uns nun mit unserem zweifelhaften Schutz weiter auf die Suche. (323 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0039 (1949-03-17 - Göttingen)Ich klettere einen langen, gleichmässig ansteigenden grünen Berghang hinan und denke dabei, dass er sich sehr gut zur Verteidigung eignen müsse, da er von oben bis unten übersichtlich ist. Oben auf dem Kamm will ich eine Verteidigungsstellung einrichten... Wir haben einen Gefangenen gemacht. Nun ist die Frage, ob wir ihn mitnehmen sollen, oder eine deutsche Frau. Für beide ist nicht Platz. Wenn er zurückbleibt, werden ihn seine Landsleute ums Leben bringen. Der Frau dagegen, weil sie keine militärische Person ist, wird nichts passieren. Ich rate darum, den Gefangenen mitzunehmen, weil jedes Menschenleben gerettet werden muss... Gefangene in einem Eisenbahnwagen. Ich steige ein, um Schlipse an sie zu verteilen. Für jeden ist einer da - nur für einen ein Ball. Diesen bekommt einer, der mich besonders darum bittet. Einen Augenblick ist es nicht ganz klar, ob für jeden etwas da sein wird. Da tritt einer freiwillig zurück. - Ich gebe ihm - schon im Aussteigen - einen Kuss auf die Stirn. Er hat sich in diesem Moment in ein Mädchen verwandelt (aber in der Weise, wie so oft im Traum, dass ich dies nicht weiter merke, sondern es mir erst jetzt auffällt). Ich gehe nun in den Nachbar-Raum, in dem die Schwestern sitzen. Dort werde ich genötigt, neben Bille zu sitzen. Das überrascht und erfreut mich. An der Stirnwand des Raumes sitzt Mölöchen. Sie hat ihr Bein hochgelegt, denn es ist irgendwie krank - aber sie ist zufrieden und glücklich, denn sie freut sich, dass ihre Kinder ein Fest nebenan feiern. (In diese Situation hat sich inzwischen die Traumszene gewandelt). Nun kommt eine Schwester in den Raum, um bei uns allen die Temperatur zu messen. Von meinem Thermometer liest sie ab, dass ich 37,4 1/4 Grad Fieber habe. Sie ist sehr besorgt und erkundigt sich, woher das komme. Ich sage ihr, dass es wohl nur mein akuter Schnupfen sei. 

Zweiter Traum: Ich bin mit Margund und Gisela zusammen. Da wir alle die Hooverspeisung essen, überrede ich sie, beide zusammen mit mir in die Mensa zu kommen, nachdem ich ihre Einwände wegen Zeitmangel usw. in den Wind geschlagen habe.

Dritter Traum: Aus einer Toreinfahrt kommt mir eine Einspännerfuhre entgegen. Der Kutscher ist nicht bei seinem Wagen und ich versuche, das Pferd aufzuhalten. Das gelingt mir kaum. Es tritt mit dem Vorderbein nach mir, wie es nur sehr böswillige Tiere tun. Ich habe mich an das Pferd geklammert und weiss nicht, wie ich nun loskommen soll, ohne getreten zu werden. Endlich gelingt es mir, das Pferd an einen Baum anzubinden, nachdem ich es vom Wagen abgespannt habe. Der Knecht, der nun hinzugekommen ist, nimmt kaum Notiz von dem. (435 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0040 (1949-03-18 - Göttingen)Ich bin mit Vater unterwegs mit zwei Geschützen, auf denen man sitzt wie auf einem Fahrrad und die mit Hilfe von Pedalen angetrieben werden. Vater fährt auf dem vorderen, an das das meine mit einem Seil angehängt ist. Es geht durch einen sandigen Weg und er muss sehr treten. Ich sage, dass ich absteigen wolle, denn seine Pedale haben eine Übersetzung und meine nicht, so dass er die ganze Arbeit leisten muss. Aber er sagt, es sei nicht nötig, ich solle sitzen bleiben. Dann geht es einen langen Sandweg bergab, den entlang wir hintereinander her sausen auf einer schmalen, festeren Spur, die sich durch den weicheren Sand hindurch schlängelt und die nicht zu verfehlen, man sich sehr konzentrieren muss. Jedoch verleiht diese Anspannung bei höchster Geschwindigkeit ein Gefühl grosser Befriedigung. Am Ende des Weges landen wir in dem Keller eines Hauses. Vater weiss, dass wir uns nun nach rechts halten müssen, während ich, völlig desorientiert, gerade die entgegengesetzte Richtung gegangen wäre. Aber nach rechts führen alle Türen nur in geschlossene Kellergelasse und ich schlage vor, einen langen Gang zu gehen, der nach links ins Freie führt. Draussen könne man dann bequem ums Haus herum gehen. Vater ist das nicht sympathisch und ich schliesse daraus, dass wohl Krieg sein müsse und zur linken sich die feindliche Front befindet. Als wir dann diesen Ausgang gewählt haben, eröffnet sich nach rechts draussen eine breite Strasse. Jedoch geht diese bald in einen tiefen Einschnitt über, durch den sie in ganzer Breite und mit senkrechten Wänden in den Fels gehauen ist. Oben sind grosse Querbalken über die Öffnung gelegt, über die hin eine Masse von Menschen sich bewegt, die grosse, schwere Steinbrocken auf die Strasse herunter wälzt. Es handelt sich offensichtlich um einen Strassenbau, der in seiner Aufmachung mit der Verwendung grosser Sklavenmengen und der Verwertung ganz elementaren Materials an ein antikes Unternehmen erinnert. Vater läuft schnell hindurch und ist bald vor der langsam vorschreitenden Welle der Arbeitenden über ihm und damit ausserhalb der Gefahrenzone. Jedesmal aber, wenn ich vorlaufen will, werden gerade vor mir schwere Steine hinabgeworfen, so viel ich auch rufen und für einen Augenblick um freie Bahn bitten mag. Schliesslich fasse ich mir ein Herz, doch hindurchzulaufen. Doch schon nach wenigen Schritten werde ich von einem Stein an der Seite getroffen, taumle zurück und setze mich an die Böschung. Als ich mich erholt habe, klettere ich die hohe Böschungswand hinauf, um nun oben neben diesem tiefen Einschnitt zu gehen. Oben sehe ich zur Linken die Hütten eines Dorfes liegen. Vor mir, am Ende der versenkten Strasse, dehnt sich das Meer. Dort steht mein Vater am Ausgang des Strassenschachtes, wo er in eine Steilküste am Meer mündet. Er will gerade umkehren, um nach mir zu schauen, und nur, indem ich mich flach auf den Bauch auf den Rand des Einschnittes lege, um ihm zuzurufen, kann ich ihn hindern, sich noch einmal in die Gefahrenzone zurückzubegeben. (Hier folgt im Handschrifttext eine Zeichnung, die die Szene darstellt). 

Dann Szenenwechsel. Vater ist gestorben und drinnen, das heisst, in dem Raum, den vorher dieser Schacht bildete, aufgebart. Ich sitze draussen mit Gisela vor der Tür. Es kommen eine Menge Leute, ihn zu sehen, darunter auch die Wirtin, eine kleine, neugierige und etwas aufdringliche, kupplerische Frau. Nach einer Zeit kommt Onkel Adolf. Ich stehe auf und muss mich gewaltsam zwingen, ein ernstes, trauriges Gesicht zu machen, denn all die vielen Besuche und Beileidswünsche haben mich längst zum Lächeln gebracht. (571 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0041 (1949-03-19 - Göttingen)Ich beginne mit einem Auto abzufahren, während ich noch hinten sitze und von dort vornübergebeugt steure um dann in der Fahrt nach vorne überzusteigen. Doch als der Wagen sich in Bewegung setzt, ist die Strasse schon voller Menschen, Frauen, Mädchen, Kinder, die ich rettungslos überfahren müsste. Darum trete ich noch im Stehen von hinten mit äusserster Gewalt auf den Hebel, den ich als Bremse erkenne, und kann den Wagen dadurch immer gerade so weit bremsen, dass ein Anfahren der Passanten im letzten Moment vermieden wird, jedoch nie ihn völlig zum Stehen bringen. Als ich endlich ganz vorne sitze, droht der Wagen jedoch im Gewühl allmählich stehen zu bleiben. Ich suche nun nach dem Gashebel und nehme das Steuer fest in die Hand, um endlich sicherer meinen Weg finden zu können. Das ganze war in der Theaterstrasse. 

Zweite Traumszene: Auf dem Theaterplatz ein Reiter. Haltung und Sitz sind vorbildlich. Das Pferd ist ein edles Tier. Dem Auge ist alles eine Freude. Doch plötzlich verliert er die Gewalt über sein Tier, obwohl seine Haltung nichts an Vorbildlichkeit verliert. Es droht ihn so nahe an der grossen, vierarmigen Barocklampe, die mitten auf dem Platz steht, vorbeizuführen, dass er an ihrem Pfeiler das linke Knie zerschlagen muss. Dann ein Ausfall nach rechts. Im Galopp auf mich zu. Ich springe entsetzt neben mir die kleine Böschung hoch, komme zu Fall und wälze mich noch im letzten Moment hinter den Baum, der dort steht. Dann gehen die Hufe neben mir vorüber.

Dritte Traumszene: Ich stehe bei Gisela vor der Etagentür der Wohnung, nachdem ich vorher schon festgestellt habe, dass sie nicht in ihrem Zimmer ist. Da kommt Herr J. (Rudolf Jentzsch) die Treppe herauf. Er hat nur ein Bein wie ein Kriegsversehrter und hüpft mit bewundernswerter Leichtigkeit die Stufen hinauf. Oben angekommen breitet er begrüssend die Arme aus und legt sich zurück wie ein Skifahrer. Auch trägt er eine weisse Skibluse. Ich habe grosse Angst, dass er in dieser Haltung das Gleichgewicht verlieren und die Treppe hinunterstürzen muss. Ich sage ihm, dass Fräulein W. nicht da sei. Überdem kommt noch ein dritter Herr die Treppe hinauf, den ich nur dunkel erinnere und der mir irgendwie unheimlich ist. (361 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0042 (1949-03-20 - Göttingen)Der war so schön, der Traum. Ich war mit L.S. (Lina Schmedeke) zu Hause. Sie war erfüllt von einer grossen, ganz natürlichen Heiterkeit. Wir kochten zusammen etwas in der Küche. Und wir waren eben beide ganz da - ohne Kummer, ohne Sehnsucht - so wie man nur dann da ist, wenn man sich ganz im Leben zu Hause fühlt. Diese Heiterkeit war bei ihr um so beglückender, als sie sonst leicht etwas Aschenputtelhaftes - vom Schicksal bedrücktes - hatte. Manchmal aber kam von innen heraus eine grosse innere Kindlichkeit und Selbstverständlichkeit, die so glücklich macht, weil wir uns ganz bei ihr geborgen fühlen. So war es hier im Traum - obgleich schlechterdings gar nichts geschah - es war nur diese Heiterkeit, die wie eine Glocke läutete. Es mag vieles zusammengekommen sein, diesen Traum zu erzeugen. Die Schneeglöckchen, die auf meinem Schreibtisch standen, erinnerten mich an ein kleines Bild, das sie gezeichnet hatte, in dem diese Heiterkeit ganz da ist. Dieses Bild liegt in den "Marmorklippen" an der Stelle, wo Jünger von dem Kloster der Falcifera spricht, "welches ganz im heiteren Stile erbaut" sei. - Es ist meist nur eine Bewegung, eine Gebärde, die ganz von innen heraus geschah, die solche Heiterkeit erzeugt, solche Brücken schlägt. - Darum sind Barock und Rokoko der heitere Stil, denn über ihnen liegt diese heitere Sicherheit, diese Serenitas, die die Fürsten jener Zeit zu repräsentieren hatten. Ich werde nie vergessen, wie mir einmal bei einem Menuett ein Arm entgegenkam, eine ausgestreckte Hand gereicht wurde in einer überzeugenden und doch überraschenden Sicherheit, die solche Gebärde als platisches Bild vor unserem inneren Auge stehen lässt wie die angehaltene Bewegtheit einer in Stein gehauenen Figur, bis sie in unseren Träumen wiederkehrt und uns Symbol wird für jene Heiterkeit, die jenseits aller Konflikte steht und uns zum idealen Sein wird, welches nicht nur ein Gebilde unserer Sehnsucht ist, sondern ein fester Grund, der bergend hinter unserem Wechsel steht. 

Zweiter Traum: Dann träumte ich wieder - wie gestern - von einem Kriegsversehrten auf einem Bein. Er ging auf zwei Krücken, jedoch mit einer gewissen sportlichen Eleganz. Da es aber durch Nässe sehr glatt war, drohte er das Gleichgewicht zu verlieren, und machte als Ausgleichsbewegung einige Schritte rückwärts. Dann fiel er aber doch hin, stand aber sofort wieder auf. Bald darauf kam er das zweite Mal ins Wanken. Als er wieder einige Schritte rückwärts machte, kam ein Auto von vorne und fuhr ganz dicht an ihm vorbei. Ich schaute oben aus dem Fenster und sah, dass es ihn überfahren würde, wenn er jetzt das Gleichgewicht verlöre. Aber er fiel nicht, blieb nur erschöpft stehen. Ich rief ihm von oben zu, er solle warten, ich wolle ihn begleiten. Nun musste ich erst meine Kleider wechseln und mir Schuhe anziehen, doch alles, was ich anzog, passte nicht zusammen, so dass es endlos lange dauerte und ich fürchte, er hat sehr warten müssen. Auch überlegte ich mir noch sehr, ob ich meinen Pelzmantel anziehen sollte, oder den Mantel mit dem Samtkragen, denn es konnte ja sein, dass es nicht günstig sei, in einem besetzten Land Kleider zu tragen, durch die man als Bourgeois auffiel - doch sträubte ich mich dagegen und wollte sie nun gerade anziehen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0043 (1949-03-21 - Göttingen)Es war in Muttis letzten Lebenstagen und ich sollte zu ihrer Pflege in die Berge fahren, wohin sie zur Erholung geschickt war. Vater war um mich und meine Reise sehr besorgt. Ich wollte per Anhalter fahren, wollte deshalb aber so wenig mitnehmen wie möglich und hatte mir auch zum Ideal gesetzt, bis zum letzten Moment vor der Abreise so meinen Tageslauf zu gehen wie immer. Ich hatte einige sehr schöne bronzene Gegenstände geerbt oder geschenkt bekommen, von denen Vater zwei ganz blank geputzt hatte. Ich mochte sie aber lieber so, wie sie waren, in einer Mischung von Glanz und Dunkelheit. Sie stammten von meinem Onkel, von dem ich auch eine Photographie hatte, die auf einem Familientreffen gemacht war. Vater war auch darauf - aber schon ganz von seiner letzten Krankheit und vom nahe bevorstehenden Tode gezeichnet. Wie denn überhaupt die Traumsituation dadurch merkwürdig gezeichnet war, dass sowohl Vater als Mutti kurz vor ihrem Tode standen, weshalb die innere Spannung, die Einstellung des Traums auf beide tendierte. Der Traum hatte sozusagen eine doppelten Skopus. Vor meiner Abreise liess ich noch schnell in einem Geschäft einige Photographien entwickeln, die ich gemacht hatte. Sie enttäuschten mich aber, denn sie waren unscharf, oder vielmehr, die Gegenstände waren zu klein und in die Ferne gerückt. Sie zeigten Szenen von einer Reitjagd, aber beim näheren Zusehen konnte man Reiter und Pferde wohl im Hintergrund entdecken. (229 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0044 (1949-03-26 - Göttingen)Ich gehe auf einer geraden, sonnigen Strasse den Berg hinan. Rechts und links sind schöne Tannen, in deren Schatten ein leiser Dunst über der Erde liegt, dann wieder liegt die Strasse streckenweise frei im Sonnenlicht. Von oben kommt mir ein Auto entgegen - es ist ein Volkswagen, wie sie jetzt alle Strassen bevölkern - und fährt direkt auf mich zu, weil ich mitten auf der Strasse gehe. Ich weiche nach rechts aus, er folgt mir nach rechts, ich weiche nach links aus, er folgt mir links. So merke ich bald, dass er mich nur erziehen will, weil ich ein "Verkehrssünder" bin. Der Spass gefällt mir. Schliesslich kommt er so nahe an mich ran, dass mir nichts anderes übrig bleibt, als auf den Kühler zu klettern und über das Auto herüber zu kriechen, um hinten wieder herunter zu springen. Kaum habe ich wieder Boden unter den Füssen, hat er mich in einem genialen Bogen von hinten schon wieder erreicht und das Spiel beginnt von Neuem. Ich bin erst gerettet, als es mir gelingt, in einem grossen Satz auf den Bürgersteig zu springen. Dort werde ich respektiert. Nun sind auf der Strasse einige Ausbesserungsstellen mit Teer und kleinen Steinchen, die man durch eine rotweisse Barriere kenntlich gemacht hat. Der Mann fährt nun in kühnen Kurven um diese Ausbesserungsstellen herum. Inzwischen kommt ein grauer, etwas grösserer Wagen von unten die Strasse hinauf. Es gibt beinahe einen Zusammenstoss. Die Wagen bleiben haarscharf nebeneinander stehen und mein verwegener Freund meint: "Nun wäre es doch beinahe noch schief gegangen - das kommt davon." Der Mann gefällt mir. Wir gehen zusammen in ein Haus. Er will dort irgendwelche Schriften hinbringen, um die Menschen aufzuklären - aber man hat den Eindruck, sie verstehen seinen Humor und seine Ironie gar nicht. Er geht einfach frech in die Zimmer, dass mein Erstaunen immer mehr steigt. Schliesslich reisst er eine Tür auf. Ich sehe jemanden im Bett liegen, der als mein fragender Blick ihn trifft, lächeln muss und den Kopf auf die Seite dreht. Da begreife ich, dass der Mann in sein eigenes Haus gegangen ist und mich mit dem ganzen Zauber nur aufgezogen hat. Der Spass ist sehr gelungen und ich erwache in heiterer Stimmung. (365 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0046 (1949-03-27 - Göttingen)Ich habe für einen Wettbewerb eine Plastik gemacht. Gekrönt werden je zwei Gemälde und je zwei Plastiken. Ich bekam den zweiten Preis. Die Büste stellt einen etwas dinarischen Kopf dar. Sehr dunkle Haare und tiefliegende, dunkle Augen, ein schmales Kinn. Ein wenig Ähnlichkeit mit Pastor Heinzeler. Dann ist - kurz vor meiner Abreise - zum Abschluss eine Feier. Pastor Heinzeler hält eine sehr tiefsinnige Ansprache. Mir prägen sich besonders die Gebärden seiner Hände ein, die mir eigentlich den tiefen Sinn seiner Gedanken vermitteln. Hinterher werden die Gemälde vorgezeigt. Hindenburg ist auch erschienen. Er wird zuerst in den Saal geführt und ich höre noch, wie Heinzeler ihm auf französisch sagt: "Hier sind die Gemälde - und hier die Plastiken". - Ich verhalte meinen Schritt im Fortgehen noch etwas, um zu hören, ob noch mein Name fällt. Dann kommt Hindenburg heraus, um mich zu begrüssen. Ich rede ihn im Verlauf der Unterhaltung drei Mal an. Einmal als Herr Generalfeldmarschall, einmal Exzellenz und einmal Herr General. Er ist sehr freundlich, hat ein strahlendes Gesicht und leuchtende, braune Augen. Er verabschiedet sich sehr herzlich. Dann träumte mir, ich sei aus diesem Traum erwacht und erzählte nun jemandem, wie ich im Traum eine Büste gemacht und den zweiten Preis dafür bekommen habe, aber das sei nur im Traum möglich.

Ein von hinten auf seinem Rad vorbeikommender Kriegsversehrter mit einem Bein und einer Prothese kommt dabei zu Fall und liegt nun - obgleich nicht verletzt - so unglücklich über seiner Prothese, dass er sich nicht erheben kann. Ich fasse ihn nun unter die Schultern und ziehe ihn hoch, während er sich auf sein Rad stützt. Im Fortgehen will ich meinen Arm um ihn legen, um ihn sicherer gehen zu lassen, doch er meint, das sei nicht nötig - er habe sich ja nicht weh getan. (102 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0048 (1949-03-28 - Göttingen)Ich bin in Roggow. Jedoch ist das schöne, alte Schloss von einem verständnislosen neuen Besitzer sehr ungünstig verwandelt worden. Er hat es völlig umgebaut, doch so, dass man den alten Grundriss noch erkennen kann, und innen merkwürdig ausstaffiert. Auf dem oberen Flur im Treppenhaus stehen an der Aussenwand wie in einem Krankenhaus nebeneinander lauter weisse Betten, zwischen ihnen je ein Nachttisch, der mit grünen Girlanden geschmückt ist. Auf jedem steht eine schöne Nachttischlampe, die mit einer Schnur an einen Steckkontakt angeschlossen ist. Über den Betten, zwischen den Fenstern hängen Madonnen-Bilder - und zwar serienweise immer drei oder vier mal nebeneinander die gleichen. Sie sind alle im italienischen Stil. Der eine Typ hat Ähnlichkeit mit einer weissen emaillierten Reliefmadonna auf blauem Grund, wie wir sie früher zu Hause hängen hatten und wie sie wohl häufig in Böhmen hergestellt wird. - Nun traf ich vor dem Haus Frau v. Oertzen, die mir die einzelnen Besonderheiten dieses nun so merkwürdig veränderten Hauses zeigen wollte. Sie hatte ein grosses Schlüsselbund, mit dem sie in alle Gemächer und Gänge hineinkam. - Als wir aber hineingehen wollten, musste sie unbewacht draussen einen Pferdewagen zurücklassen, für den sie aufzupassen hatte. Da es aber nur ruhige Ackerpferde waren, die ihm vorgespannt waren, machte sie dies Wagnis - doch schon als wir das Haus betraten, sah ich im Umkucken, wie eins der Pferde, durch ein von hinten kommendes Fuhrwerk erschreckt, zur Seite ausbrach. Ich sagte aber nichts, um mir den Genuss dieser Führung nicht entgehen zu lassen. So betraten wir denn das Haus und sie führte mich durch viele kleine Winkel und Gemächer. Dort hing in einer Kammer ein Vasenbild, das sie besonders liebte und an dem sie sich in diesem allgemeinen Durcheinander von Geschmacksverwirrungen wieder erfreuen mochte. Sie erzählte, dass es sie an ihre Jugend erinnere, an einen kleinen Theaterspiegel, den sie besessen - also einen kleinen Spiegel, mit dessen Hilfe man sich - ins Theater gegangen - frisierte - in den man von unten herauf so hineingesehen hätte, dass man nebenbei die einzelnen Bilder, eine Art Rokoko-Dame darstellend, miterblickt habe. 

Vor dieser Szene hatte sich der Traum schon weiter zurückerstreckt. Wir gingen durch einen Park, der diesmal mit dem von Wittmoldt das gemeinsam hatte, dass er auf einer Insel im Wasser lag. Hier war zwar eine Änderung der Anlage geplant und angefangen, aber nicht zu Ende geführt, so dass hinter den einzelnen Staffagen noch der alte Nützlichkeitssinn der ehemaligen Besitzer hindurchschaute. Z.B. sah man hinter einer Baumreihe, die Wald vorstellte, aufgerichtet eine Art Heuschober, lang hingezogen, in welchem unter dem trocknenden Heu noch Holz für den Winter aufgeschichtet lag. Hier ging ich mit Vater - und zwar war es nun während dieses Spazierganges der Park Rothspalk - und er erzählte, mit wie kurzsichtigen Mitteln irgendein Narr versucht hatte, eine neue Anlage zu schaffen. Er habe eine Fläche gerodet und gleich dort Rasen gesät, durch den ja das Unkraut durchbrechen musste - anstatt erst Bohnen und Kartoffeln zu pflanzen, die man ja auch gar nicht hätte ernten brauchen, da sie nur das Unkraut vertilgen sollten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0050 (1949-03-31 - Göttingen)Ich träumte von vielen unendlich feinen Gesprächen, deren Inhalt ich nicht mehr weiss und deren Feinheit der Form nicht mehr darzustellen ist. Ich führte sie mit den verschiedensten Menschen in den verschiedensten Räumen und Winkeln eines grossen Hauses. Schliesslich stand ich mit anderen Schlange vor dem Sprechzimmer eines Arztes. Da mir aber das Stehen zu langweilig wurde, verliess ich meinen Platz in der Schlange und setzte mich auf einem Stuhl, der mit anderen zusammen an einem Tisch in einer Sitzecke des Hauses stand. Plötzlich war aber die Schlange zu Ende und ich konnte nun ungehindert in das Sprechzimmer der Ärztin eintreten. Ich hatte meinen Waschlappen in der Hand, der noch feucht war, weswegen ich ihn nicht in die Tasche stecken mochte. So legte ich ihn zusammengedrückt auf eine Bank. Die Ärztin, die noch beschäftigt gewesen war, drehte sich zu mir rum, um mich zu untersuchen. Während wir miteinander sprachen, entdeckte sie den Waschlappen, hielt ihn für ein Taschentuch und wollte es aufheben. Als sie aber bemerkte, dass es ganz feucht war, warf sie es verächtlich in einem grossen Bogen aus dem Fenster. Ich legte meinen Arm um ihre Schultern und sagte lächelnd: "Nun haben sie meinen Waschlappen aus dem Fenster geworfen", wobei ich sie im Zimmer fortgehend so einige Schritte mittnahm. Es war eine kleine Frau, wohl Ende der Dreissiger, die einen weissen Arztkittel trug. "Ich muss ihn nachher unten aufheben", sagte ich mit freundlicher Miene und stellte mir vor, wie er den unten wandelnden Patienten auf den Kopf gefallen sein möge. Als ich unten ankam, sah ich neben dem vielstöckigen Haus, in dem ich gewesen war, eine kleinere Villa stehen. In dem schmalen Raum zwischen beiden lag mein Waschlappen in dem Garten der Villa. Ich ging schnell unbemerkt durch die Gartenpforte hinein, da ich nicht über den Zaun steigen mochte, ging dann um das Haus herum und holte mir meinen Waschlappen. Dann ging ich durch die Strassen der Stadt. Es war Hamburg. Zur Linken sah ich ein strahlend erleuchtetes Kino mit dem Reklameschild. "Das Capitol gegenüber dem alten Führer und dem neuen Führer". Gegenüber stand ein grosses Gebäude mit einer einzigen erleuchteten Glaswand zur Strasse. Dort war früher zu lesen gewesen: "Kreisleitung der NSDAP", jetzt stand die Aufschrift einer modernen Verwaltungsbehörde daran. Ich ging nun die Treppe im Treppenhaus hinauf und hörte und sah gleichzeitig, wie in einem Film, in dem zeitlich auseinanderliegend Aufeinanderfolgendes in fortlaufender Reihe in Bildern gezeigt und in Worten erläutert wird, so sah ich, wie das verfallene Gebäude wieder hergerichtet worden war, wie es zuerst durchgeregnet hatte und die Tropfen auf die Treppenstufen des gekachelten Treppenhauses fielen, dann wie es sauber gemacht wurde und mir jemand, mit dem Besen die einzelnen Stufen abfegend, entgegenkam usw. Gleichzeitig hörte ich die Beschreibung dieser Errungenschaften. Als ich in einem oberen Stockwerk angekommen war, war es Winter und das Eis in der Strasse, die nun zu einem Fluss geworden war, schwoll immer mehr an, bis es in meiner Höhe war und ich an dem Rand entlang ging. Noch immer wurden alle Bilder von einer, wie im Film, erklärenden Stimme begleitet. Autos und Wagen fuhren über das Eis und ich wunderte mich, dass sie nicht einbrachen. Dann kam mir ein schlittschuhlaufender Junge entgegen, mit ganz grossen, langen Schlittschuhen, mit denen er keine Kurven laufen konnte. So kam er ganz gerade auf mich zu und wäre mir über die Füsse gefahren, wenn ich ihn nicht im letzten Augenblick gefasst und meinen Arm um ihn gelegt hätte. Wir unterhielten uns eine Weile. Dann sah ich, wie andere das Eis überquerten, um an das andere Ufer zu kommen, obwohl es schon dünn war. Ich ging weiter und trat in eine Pfütze und spritze mich dabei voll. Ich trug eine kurze Flanellhose, denn es war schon warm, und lange seidene Strümpfe, die ich bei näherem Zusehen als Damenstrümpfe erkannte, worüber ich mich wunderte. Ich fühlte mich in der Leichtigkeit der Kleidung sehr wohl. Dann lief auch ich über das Eis und kam auf der anderen Seite über einen Acker, den ich nun mit dem jüngeren Kai zusammen in Wittmodt überquerte. Bald waren wir auf einem Feld, das zu bearbeiten war, und er sagte, wenn wir um zwei Uhr her gehen, müssen wir eigentlich um fünf fertig sein. In drei Stunden könnten wir das schaffen. Ich stimmte zwar zu, hatte aber ein ungemütliches Gefühl bei dem Gedanken an körperliche Arbeit. Dann ging der Weg weiter. Ich ging mit einem Knecht neben einem Gespann. Es waren zwei Gespanne zusammengespannt, aber mit unzureichenden Mitteln, sodass bei abschüssigem Weg der hintere auf den vorderen Wagen rollen musste und die Pferde dazwischen verletzt werden. Es waren braune Pferde. So hielt ich denn mit an dem Strick, der den Wagen zurückhalten sollte. Schliesslich kam ich dabei auf dem Wagen zu liegen, und zwar so, dass vier Räder unter mir waren und an meinem Anzug schleiften und dass ich eigentlich nur auf diesen Rädern lag. Ich schrie dem Knecht:"Halt, Halt!" zu, aber er fuhr immer schneller, und hielt erst an, als er mich verstanden hatte. Ich fragte jemand, ob mein Anzug gelitten habe, und er sagte, es sei ein kleines Loch. Als ich mich umschaute, sah ich drei dicke Bremsenspuren von den Rädern auf ihm und der Stoff war völlig abgeschabt. Es war mein guter, grüner Anzug und ich war sehr verzweifelt. Ich lief einen kleinen Hang zu einer Brüstung hinunter, von wo man eine schöne Aussicht hatte und legte meinen Kopf auf die Mauer und überliess mich meiner Verzweiflung, die wie eine erwürgende Leerheit in mir war. Dann tröstete mich irgendjemand und ich erwachte. (924 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0051 (1949-04-01 - Göttingen)Ich bin im Hause eines alten Herrn aus Anlass einer Gesellschaft. Er bekommt einen Schwindelanfall, als ich gerade bei ihm stehe. Ich lege den Arm um seine Schulter, um ihn zu seinem Bett zu führen. Als wir an einem grünen Sofa vorbeikommen, haucht er noch mit letzter Kraft: "Hier dieses Sofa", und ich lasse ihn dort nieder. Es stellt sich heraus, dass er schon ein Jahr lang schwer herzkrank ist, ohne dass seine Frau etwas davon geahnt hat. - In der nächsten Traumszene ist es ein wesentlich jüngerer Mann. Er liegt auf dem Sofa ausgestreckt. Die ganze Gesellschaft sitzt noch um ihn herum im Zimmer. Als er aus seiner Ohnmacht erwacht, sitze ich an seinem Kopfende. Er redet wirres Zeug wie im Fieber und sagt, es sei immerhin keine Kleinigkeit, wenn man die Tollwut gehabt habe. Ich höre sehr gespannt seinen Reden zu und begreife den tieferen Sinn, der noch hinter seiner äusserlich ungereimten Worten steckt. Der Mann hat einen Kopf von auffallender Schädelbildung, eine grosse, gewölbte Stirn und einen weit nach hinten ausladenden Hinterkopf. Das Gesicht läuft nach unten relativ schmal zu, so dass er den Eindruck eines sehr klugen, aber wenig energischen Mannes macht. Ich habe die Hand auf seine Stirn gelegt und führe sie leise hin und her. Er bittet mich, ihn noch länger so zu kraulen und zu massieren, das sei so wohltuend, und ich versuche, dies mit grösster Leichtigkeit und Feinheit auszuführen. Als ich dabei einmal auch die Gegend des Hinterkopfes berühre, bittet er mich, mit medizinischen Ausdrücken, nur die vordere Kopfpartie zu massieren. Ich wechsle die Hände manchmal ab, wenn sie müde geworden sind, und berühre zuletzt nur noch ganz fein mit den Fingerspitzen seine Kopfhaut zwischen den über der Stirn schon spärlichen Haaren. Als es ihm schon wieder besser geht, habe ich ihn auf dem Wege durch die Stadt zu begleiten. Wir gehen über eine Art Bahnsteig. Der Schaffner ruft:"Vorsicht, der Zug fährt ab!", nachdem mühsam alle Reisenden eingestiegen sind, und ich sehe einen einzigen Strassenbahnwagen mit einer französischen Aufschrift abfahren. Ich frage, was das zu bedeuten habe, und mein Patient, dem ich noch immer den Arm um die Schulter gelegt habe, antwortet mir, dass wir hier ganz dicht an der holländischen Grenze seien und dieser Wagen führe nur bis zur Grenze. Wir gehen weiter durch die Stadt. Dort sehe ich einen sehr schönen, sehr alten romanischen Rundbau. Bei näherem Zusehen entdecke ich, dass er schon frühgotische Züge trägt. Ich halte es zuerst für eine Kirche, erkenne es dann aber als ein Brunnenhaus. Mein Begleiter legt einmal seinen Kopf auf meinen Arm zurück. Ich denke, er bekomme wieder einen Anfall, aber er sagt nur, es sei dies so wohltuend für ihn. Er hat nun die Züge eines Vetters von mior angenommen. Wir suchen einen Konzertsaal in der Stadt, zu dem die übrige Gesellschaft mit der besagten Strassenbahn gefahren ist. Wir können den richtigen Weg nicht mehr finden und ich sage zu ihm:"Wollen wir doch das geschminkte Mädchen fragen, das dort an der Ecke steht". Er geht etwas betroffen auf sie zu und spricht einige Worte. Als er schon im Fortgehen ist, frage ich sie nach dem Weg und sie antwortet mir und redet mich dabei mit dem Vornamen meines Bruders an. Ich schaue ihr ins Gesicht. Sie ist sehr schön, hat dunkle, schwarze Haare, einen tiefsinnigen russischen Gesichtsausdruck und kräftige rote Lippen. Besonders der Blick der Augen prägt sich ganz tief ein. Ich frage sie:"Woher kennen Sie meinen Namen?" Sie antwortet mit den Worten: "Frag mich nicht". Ihr Gesicht bekommt einen tiefschmerzlichen Ausdruck und sie wendet sich zum Gehen. In diesem Augenblick begreife ich, dass es die Frau des Vetters, eine nach Frankreich emigrierte Russin sein muss. Ich fasse im Gehen ihre Hand und ziehe sie, die mir nur widerstrebend folgt, noch einmal so weit zu mir heran, dass ich auf die von hinten gereichte Hand flüchtig einen Kuss drücken kann, ehe sie sich aus der meinen löst. Dann laufe ich meinem Begleiter nach, der auf der anderen Strassenseite in grossen, kräftigen Schritten dem Konzertsaal zustrebt. Er bedarf meiner Stütze nicht mehr. Er mutet mich jetzt noch wesentlich grösser und schlanker an als vorher und trägt eine grüne Uniform. Wir fragen einen entgegenkommenden Polizisten nach dem Weg, der uns nun entgültige Auskunft gibt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0052 (1949-04-02 - Göttingen)Spaziergang mit Krischan (Christian) und einem ihm bekannten Mädchen. Wir stehen vor unserer Haustür und Krischan drückt während des Gesprächs bei heftigem Gebärden, doch ganz in Gedanken, zweimal die Klingel meiner Oberbewohner. Als ich begreife, was passiert ist, rate ich zum Weitergehen, um eine peinliche Situation zu vermeiden. Auf dem Wege höre ich noch, wie die Frau, die uns oben aus dem Fenster gesehen hat, ihre kleine Tochter hinter uns her schickt. Ich denke mir schnell eine Geschichte aus, mit der man das Mädchen abspeisen kann. - Nächste Traumszene: Wir sitzen nun zu dritt auf einer kleinen Bank des Abends auf einem Platz in der Stadt. Um uns herrscht reger Betrieb. Die Frauen kucken aus den Fenstern und unterhalten sich über die Strasse. Aus ihrem Gespräch kündigt sich an, dass jetzt der Förster kommt, eine anscheinend wichtige Person im Stadtleben. Nun sehen wir ihn aus einer Seitengasse kommen, über den Platz spazieren, eine prächtige Erscheinung. Er hat einen grünen Anzug an und trägt einen weiten Hut auf dem Kopf. Er ist begleitet von zwei Frauen, deren eine zu ihm zu gehören scheint, während die andere mehr wie eine zufällige Begleitung wirkt und sich auch nach einigen Schritten allmählich einen eigenen Weg in anderer Richtung sucht. Uns gegenüber auf einer Bank auf der anderen Seite des Platzes sitzt eine Frau im Pelzmantel, von der wir schon wissen, dass sie etwas von dem Förster will. Wir hören nun, wie die Frauen aus den Fenstern rufen, jetzt sei es die Zeit für sie, zu ihm zu gehen. Sie hat sich unschlüssig von ihrer Bank erhoben und jammert laut, dass es für sie doch keinen Zweck haben werde, die andere Frau da schiene er ja auch weggeschickt zu haben. Krischan ist jetzt aufgestanden, um etwas von der Sache zu erforschen und mit dem Förster zu sprechen, der bald die andere Seite des Platzes erreicht hat. Ich sehe nun, wie sich die Frau ihm nähert. Erscheinung und Bewegung der Figuren haben etwas Marionettenhaftes, Distanziertes und wirken wie auf einer fernliegenden Bühne. Gleichzeitig höre ich, wie die Frauen sagen: "Hört ihr seinen Pfiff" und vernehme ein feines, sehr einprägsames Pfeifsignal von der anderen Seite des Platzes wie ein Vogelpfiff. Das Mädchen neben mir folgt der Szene mit gleicher Gespanntheit. Wir erkennen, wie sich die Frau dem Förster zu nähern vermag. Ich bemerke, dass es oft auffällig ist, wie es Frauen in impulsiver Weise verstehen, sich der Situation zu bemächtigen und wie oft sie es sind, die die ersten Brücken zu einem Verstehen schlagen. Sie antwortet mir, dass diese Frau nur etwas ganz äusserliches von dem Manne wolle. Während unser beider Blicke gespannt auf die Situation gerichtet sind, rücken wir auf unserer Bank aneinander und ich lege meinen Arm um sie und ziehe sie ganz nahe zu mir ran. Dann kommt ein Student vorbei und setzt sich auf den hierdurch auf der rechten Seite frei gewordenen Platz. Als Christian zurückkommt, sagt er nur: "Aber Kinder, so können wir doch heute Nacht hier nicht schlafen". Der Student rückt nun ganz an das äusserste Ende der Bank, so dass er eigentlich nur noch halb und wie ein ungern gesehener Gast auf ihr sitzt. Wir rücken nach und Krischan setzt sich links neben mir nieder. Es erscheint mir ein ungemütlicher Gedanke, auf dieser harten Bank des Nachts schlafen zu sollen, und ich überlege, warum es Krischan vorzieht, anstatt zu uns nach Hause zu wandern. (564 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0053 (1949-04-02 - Göttingen)Heute nacht unterhielt ich mich in einer Kette von Träumen mit den verschiedensten Personen. Besonders in Erinnerung geblieben sind mir davon nur zwei. Das eine war ein Altersgenosse, der aus der Kriegsgefangenschaft heimkehrte. Es war ein Klassenkamerad meines Bruders. Nun fand er beide Eltern tot und alles ausgestorben. Dies Leid ergriff mich so sehr - es war in der Zeit kurz nach dem Tode meines Vaters, dass ich aus dem eigenen Innern einen Strom tiefer Trauer hervorquellen fühlte - obgleich ich sonst dem Tode meines Vaters sehr nüchtern und sachlich kühl gegenüber gestanden hatte und keine Träne vergossen, weil ich ihn nur wohltuend und als reife Frucht empfand. - Hier nun war es ein süsses Gefühl, die Trauer aus einer grossen Tiefe hervorquellen zu sehen. Er ergriff meine Hand und tröstete mich, und gehalten von dieser festen Form, gab ich mich ganz der ausströmenden Traurigkeit hin und fühlte mich so, wunderbar geöffnet und atmete tief auf. - In dem anderen Traum war ich bei meiner Mutter, die schon schwer lungenkrank, auf ihrem Bett lag. Wir sassen beieinander und fühlten uns sehr innig verbunden und während wir sonst grosse Distanz wahrten, um jede Ansteckungsgefahr zu vermeiden, empfand ich hier eine Gleichgültigkeit gegen alle praktischen Rücksichten und war bereit, dem Wert dieser Stunde alle Vorsicht zu opfern. Ich spürte bei meiner Mutter ein ähnliches Empfinden und ähnliche Konsequenzen, so dass ich nur leise erschrak, als, da ich näher mich zu ihr auf das Bett gesetzt hatte, mein Fuss den ihren berührte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0054 (1949-04-04 - Göttingen)Ich war in Roggow. Doch hob sich das Bild feinen Glanzes und edler Formen schon von dem düsteren Untergrund revolutionärer Stimmungen und Unruhe ab. Ich ging am Morgen durch die Räume des Schlosses. Es war ein strahlender schöner Sommermorgen in aller Frühe. Plötzlich hörte ich Musik. Ich beugte mich aus dem Fenster, doch sah nichts, nur die stille morgendliche Landschaft. Dann schaute ich in einer anderen Himmelsrichtung hinaus. Als ich zum Fenster ging, hörte ich schon am nahen Klang der Musik, dass es hier sein musste. Ich beugte mich hinaus, und sah eine Dorfkapelle aufgebaut. Als ich hinabging, fand ich Herrn und Frau v.O. (von Oertzen), die Geburtstag hatte. Die Leute gratulierten. Als sie fortgingen durch die Räume des Hauses, sahen sie den schönen Gabentisch und einen gedeckten Tisch. Ihre spitzen Bemerkungen durchzuckten mich wie ein plötzlicher Schreck. Herr v.O. sagte noch ein freundliches Wort und sie gingen. Es war etwas Unheimliches in der ganzen Situation. Herr v.O. zeigte mir das Frühstückstischchen und sagte, "den zu decken, war eigentlich Eure Aufgabe. Jetzt rasch, hole mir den richtigen Teller, der dort hingehört, ich habe nur irgend einen ergriffen." Dort stand, richtig aufgebaut, irgendein Service, das wohl lange nicht mehr gebraucht im Schrank gestanden hatte. Ich betrachtete es und schickte mich an, das neue zu holen. (214 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0055 (1949-04-05 - Göttingen)In einem Turnsaal Gymnastikübungen. Als sie beendet sind, sehe ich noch ein Mädchen in einer wunderbaren Beherrschtheit ihres Körpers einige Übungen ausüben. Ich will ihr beispringen, doch nur bei einigen Bewegungen, in denen es besonders schwer ist, die Gleichgewichtslage zu halten, gestattet sie, dass ich ihr die Hand zur Hilfestellung reiche. Dann jedoch sagt sie: "Sie können sich ruhig hier auf diese Seite ganz zu mir stellen" und bittet mich, den Teppich, auf dem sie bei ihren Übungen steht, noch ein wenig zur Seite zu ziehen. Dann stehe ich auf dem Rande des Teppichs. Es ist eine wunderbare Schönheit in ihren Bewegungen, die keineswegs darin aufgeht, eine sinnliche Freude zu sein, sondern viel mehr hoch über einer solchen schwebt in einer grossen praktischen Uninteressiertheit und in beglückender Leichtigkeit.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0057 (1949-04-10 - Göttingen)Ich sah irgendwo eine Schlange stehen. Es wurden Liebesgaben verteilt. Doch war es mir zu anstrengend, mich mitanzustellen. Als ich mich erkundigte, was dort verteilt werde, erfuhr ich, dass man auch eine Reise nach England geschenkt bekommen könne. Man musste seine Wünsche irgendwie aufzeichnen. Ich sah einen Tisch, in den kleine Heftzwecken gesteckt wurden. Auf einer Heftzwecke entdeckte ich eine kleine Sonne, die auf ein Stück Papier gekritzelt war, welches um den Kopf der eingesteckten Zwecke geschlagen und auf diese Weise festgeklemmt war. Bei näherem Zuschauen erkannte ich den Tisch als eine Landkarte von England ohne Ortseintragungen. Jeder steckte seine Zwecke dorthin, wo er hinreisen wollte, und schrieb den Namen des Ortes daneben. Ich sah schon die Namen London und Kent dort stehen und versuchte, den Namen Biddenden - das ist der Ort, wo meine Verwandten wohnen - an die richtige Stelle in Kent zu schreiben. Dann fiel mir noch ein, dass ich auch den Namen Bishopsdale (so heisst ihre kleine Farm) dazuschreiben müsse. Ich hatte nun mit meiner grossen Schrift fast die ganze Landkarte vollgeschrieben. Die beiden Namen sprangen auf den ersten Blick in die Augen. Ich war gewiss, in meinen Wünschen berücksichtigt zu werden. Um meine Heftzwecke einzustecken, musste ich vorher ein Papier um sie schlagen und durch die übergeschlagenen Enden dieses Papiers den Stift der Zwecke bohren, damit es sich nicht loslösen könne. Dies wollte mir nicht gelingen und ich schaute voll Sorge auf die Tür, in der nun die Schlange verschwunden war und hinter der gerade die letzten Leute abgefertigt wurde. Gleichzeitig war ich froh, um das Schlangestehen herumgekommen zu sein. Hierbei wandelte sich die Szene. Ich stand in einer Kirche und hatte meine Zwecke auf dem Altar zu befestigen. Doch musste ich vorher ein grosses Tuch herumschlagen, das eigentlich viel zu gross war. Als ich endlich fertig war, trug ich den so entstanden weissen Gegenstand, der auf einmal viel grösser war, schnell nach vorn und drücke ihn fest auf die Deckplatte. Vor dem Altar stand ein Pastor, der gerade mit einer Lesung beschäftigt war. Erst jetzt wurde ich gewahr, dass ich ihn in der Ausübungen seiner Funktion störte. Ich ging zu meinem Platz in der vordersten Reihe zurück und stellte mich wieder zwischen die anderen Menschen. Mir wurde sehr schlecht, und ich sagte zu Emmi, die neben mir stand: "Ich kann nicht mehr stehen" und setzte mich dann sofort und etwas ostentativ nieder. Da entdeckte ich, dass nun auch alle anderen Menschen schon sassen. Nur Emmi stand noch. Es war ihr wohl peinlich und sie machte einen Anlauf und sprang und klettere über die erste Bank, um sich in die zweite Reihe zu setzen. Wohl wollte sie etwas in den Hintergrund gerückt sein. - Mir war sehr heiss geworden und ich hatte mir sofort die Jacke ausgezogen und dafür meinen blauen Rollkragenpullover angezogen. Nun wollte ich mir die Jacke wieder anziehen doch war sie inzwischen zu dem Pastor am Altar geraten. Ich bat sie zurück und er warf sie mir unwillig an den Kopf. Ich sagte sehr laut und deutlich. "Auch in der Kirche kann man höflich sein". (513 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0058 (1949-04-11 - Göttingen)Ich war zur Heilgymnastikstunde bei Annelie aus Hildesheim und lag auf meiner Bank zur Rückenmassage. Vor mir hatte ich ein Kunstgeschichtsbuch liegen, das ich dort irgendwo aufgetrieben hatte, und in dem ich blätterte. Sie schaute über meine Schulter mit in das Buch. Als ich an eine Aktdarstellung im Rubenschen Stil kam, merkte ich, wie sie sie ganz nach anatomischen Gesichtspunkten beurteilte. Sie hatte einiges daran auszusetzen, auch an der Farbe, die einen goldenen Schimmer von eigentlich sehr grosser Feinheit über die Haut legte. Unter dem Bild stand aber zu meiner Verwunderung der Name Botticelli - Jedoch nicht mit dem Vornamen Sandro, sondern mit irgend einem anderen. Als ich weiterblätterte, stiess ich auf Handzeichnungen von Goethe. Auf der nächsten Seite waren humorvolle Zeichnungen von ihm, die Frauen mit ganz grossem Doppelkinn darstellt, jedoch nur ganz fein angedeutet, sodass man sie nur erraten konnte. - Dann folgten ausgedehnte Wiedergaben von Goetheschen Kinderzeichnungen. Ich meinte entrüstet, dass es eigentlich wirklich unnötig sei, so die Blätter mit künstlerisch völlig nebensächlichen Kinderzeichnungen zu füllen, bloss weil Goethe ein berühmter Mann gewesen sei. Das gehöre nicht in eine Kunstgeschichte. Es entspann sich zwischen uns ein lebhaftes Gespräch, in dessen Verlauf sie sich einmal versprach und mich Du nannte. Ich drehte mich um und schaute ihr schalkhaft in das Gesicht, das in seiner Feinheit der Linien wirklich an einen Botticelli oder Filippino Lippi erinnerte. Sie tat aber, als ob sie gar nichts merkte, und redete mich ruhig weiter mit Du an. Ich antwortete ihr auf die selbe Weise. Und erst später im Verlauf des Gespräch liess sie es unmerklich in die Sie-Form zurückgleiten. Ich wollte noch einmal Du sagen, aber ich erwachte. (275 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0059 (1949-04-18 - Bayern)Ich gehe am oberen Rande eines hohen Abhanges und unterhalte mich mit Menschen, die an seinem Fuss und auf halber Höhe wandern. Ein Offizier gibt Instruktionen über den Verlauf und die strategischen Fehler des Ostfeldzuges. Er sagt, Durchbrüche könnten nur dort gelingen, wo eine Truppe schon einmal Erfolg dabei gehabt hätte, oder wo sie Vertrauen auf eine besonders gute Ausrüstung haben dürfe. Er sprach von römischen Legionen. Ich erlebte es mit und sah mich als einen aus ihren Reihen. Das Gepäck war eingeteilt und wurde den vorauseilenden, schnell beweglichen Mannschaften nachgeschickt: ein Rucksack Waffen, ein Rucksack Ausrüstung und ein Rucksack Kleidung und ein Päckchen Rosinen. Ich sah mich einen Augenblick lang auf einem Lagerplatz, umgeben von all diesen Herrlichkeiten und mit ihnen glücklich. - Dann nahm das Gespräch eine andere Wendung. Frau v.Oertzen war auch da und beschenkte uns mit Eiern. Ich versuchte, zu essen, doch wusste ich nicht, wie ich das weiche Ei halten sollte, nachdem die Schale abgepellt war. Ich balancierte es mit grosser Mühe im letzten Moment in einen Eierbecher. Wenn ich die Bissen zum Munde führen wollte, rutschten sie vom Löffel oder schlappten aus dem Munde. Das Gespräch glitt ab ins Komische. Ich zog in der Pose mein Taschentuch aus der Tasche. Dabei flatterte ein anderes, kleines, dreckiges Taschentuch mit hinaus, ausserdem viele Papierfetzen und Eierschalen, die sich über die Stufen des Abhanges verteilten. Ich eilte hinab, um alles wieder aufzusammeln, und versuchte indess, dass Gespräch wieder auf ernste Dinge zu lenken, was mir mit Mühe gelang. (251 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0060 (1949-04-19 - Bayrischzell)Ich sah den Angeklagten Weizsäcker (im Wilhelm Strassen-Prozess). Er sah völlig ungebrochen aus. Er trug die Schlipsnadel, die ich immer trage, einen goldenen Knoten, an dessen freien Enden zwei kleine Perlen hängen, und hatte meine goldene Uhr, deren Deckel er so energisch zuschlug, dass die Perlen eingeklemmt wurde und kleine Stücke herausgebrochen wurden. Ich hörte, wie alle anderen Angeklagten sagten, dass sie die Gefängniszeit wohl nicht überstehen würden, er aber sagte, dass er noch viel vorhabe und in dieser Zeit nicht zerbrechen werde.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0061 (1949-04-19 - Bayrischzell)Ich war beim Psychotherapeuten. Er stellte fest, dass das Erlebnis, das mich am tiefsten bewegt habe, auf einer Reise mit meiner Mutter nach Kärnten gewesen sei. Ich war verwundert, denn es war nicht das stärkste und erfuhr, dass nicht die Stärke, sondern die Tiefe des Erlebens massgebend sei. Ich versetzte mich in die Erinnerung und empfand eine wohltuende elementare Losgelöstheit. (60 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0062 (1949-04-20 - Bayrischzell)Ich ging zu Weizsäcker, um mich mit ihm über Psychotherapie zu unterhalten. Wir führten ein längeres Gespräch. Adelheid war zeitweise auch dabei und es handelte sich um Vater. Dann ging ich zu Gisela. Sie wohnte in einer mehrstöckigen Neubauvilla in einem kleinen, von der Treppe zugänglichen, Zimmer. An der Tür steckte ein Zettel mit der Aufschrift "Für Herrn v.Uslar und für Herrn Krydt". Sie selbst war nicht zuhause. Ich kniete mich vor die Tür, um das Briefchen, das unter den Zettel geklemmt war, herauszuziehen. Dabei kamen Leute die Treppe rauf, denen ich im Wege sass. Auf dem Briefchen stand. "Lieber Herr v.U. Seit zwei Tagen warte ich vergebens abends oder morgens, irgendwann auf einen Besuch. Unser erstes Wiedersehen war zu kurz und zu lang, um von keinem weiteren gefolgt zu werden. Sie glauben gar nicht, wie ich mich von hier wegsehne. Ihre Gisela." Ich überlegte, dass ich schon zweimal sie nicht angetroffen habe, dann sah ich um mich die Berge und es fiel mir ein, dass ich noch gar nicht wieder in Göttingen sei und das beruhigte mich, da ich nun wusste, dass ich also nichts absichtlich versäumt hatte. Als ich das Haus verlassen hatte, merkte ich, dass ich nur eine Nachthose anhatte. Es war mir sehr peinlich, in diesem Aufzug bei Weizsäcker gewesen zu sein. Dann aber entdeckte ich, dass ich doch eine grüne Hose darüber hatte, die ich doch nicht erinnerte, übergezogen zu haben, unter der die Nachthose nur herausguckte. Ich steckte sie ein und beruhigte mich dabei. - Übrigens hatte ich oben auch den Zettel an Herrn Krydt mit einem Blick gestreift und gesehen, dass es sich um eine ganz unpersönliche Mitteilung handelte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0063 (1949-04-26 - Göttingen)Ich hörte im Radio die Eroika. Emmi war auch im Zimmer zusammen mit noch mehreren anderen Leuten, die sich unterhielten. Es war in Wittmoldt, von dem ich vorher schon manches geträumt hatte, zum Beispiel, dass es uns verboten worden war, auf dem Flügel zu spielen, der im Jungens-Zimmer stand, damit nicht die neuen Lehrlinge dies sehen und selbst dort den ganzen Tag spielen wollten. Es war dies eine Sparmassnahme, die von Tante Jusi ausging. Auch hatte ich den eigenen Schlüssel zu unserem Zimmer zurückgeben müssen. Nun gebot mir Emmi auch noch, das Radio abzustellen, da es bei der Unterhaltung störe. Das Orchester begann gerade, den zweiten Satz der Eroika zu spielen, und ich war völlig in der Musik befangen. - In einer Mischung von Wut und Verzweiflung versuchte ich sehr energisch und in Pose, den Aparat abzustellen, doch nach jeder Drehung und dem Knacken im Aparat, was man beim Abstellen hört, wurde es zwar etwas leiser, doch die Musik war nicht zum Schweigen zu bringen. Ich eilte die Treppe hinauf. Auf halber Höhe begegnete mir mein Bruder, der die Schlüssel zu unserem Zimmer in der Hand hatte. Ich forderte den Schlüssel und als ich ihn nicht gleich bekam, riss ich ihm das Schlüsselbund aus der Hand und versuchte gegen seinen Widerstand den Zimmerschlüssel vom Ring zu lösen. Er wehrte sich - doch eigentlich nur zum Schein, um mir nicht sogleich nachzugeben. Dann aber begann er mich rührend zu trösten. Ich lief den Rest der Treppe empor - es war übrigens in dieser Szene das Treppenhaus in Schwerin - und streckte mich in meinem Zimmer auf das Bett aus. Von unten drang die Musik der Eroika herauf und ich wachte auf mit ihren Klängen im Ohr und zugleich in dem Gefühl eines wunderbaren Befriedigtseins. (293 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0065 (1949-04-27 - Göttingen)Ich befand mich in einer Art von Kabinett. Es war kein Wachsfiguren-Kabinett, aber so etwas Ähnliches. In langer Reihe sassen an den Wänden historische Figuren, jede auf einem Stuhl. Es waren hauptsächlich weibliche. Ein alter Herr ging zwischen ihnen rum und scherzte mit ihnen. Er wollte ihnen neue Frisuren machen. Dazu malte er mit einem roten Stift auf ihr Gesicht neben ihre biederen Frisuren die Konturen neuer modischer und eleganter Frisuren und erzählte ihnen dabei, wie anders und wie viel schicker sie nun aussehen würden. Einem Mädchen malte er im scherzenden Gespräch dabei eine rote Nasenspitze. Ich ging neben ihm her und unterhielt mich ebenfalls mit den Figuren. Einmal fragte ich eine etwas vorwitzig, ob sie denn auch aufstehen und sich bewegen könnten. Ich bekam zur Antwort, ich solle sie nur hochziehen, dann werde ich es sehen. Es war mir gruselig dabei zumute, denn die Figuren waren ja nur Gerippe, die unter den Kleidern verborgen waren. Lediglich die Köpfe waren ganz wie lebendige gebildet. Ich reichte ihr beide Hände, um die schwere Gestalt hochzuziehen. Dabei trat sie mir auf den vorgestellten rechten Fuss und dieser schmerzte sehr unter dem festen, knöchernen Tritt. Ich sagte, so geht es nicht, ich muss den Fuss erst wegziehen. Endlich hatte sich die Figur ganz erhoben und wankte im Raume hin und her. Als sie wieder sass, sagte ich zu ihr: "Du hast ja einen abgebrochenen Stock in der Hand", denn sie trug in der Tat einen Krückstock, der dicht unter der Krücke abgebrochen war, in ihrer Rechten. Da sank sie lächelnd auf die linke Seite herüber, so dass das Krückstockende nun auf die Stuhllehne gestützt war, so wie man wohl auf Statuen irgend ein solches Stöckchen zur Stützung der Figur an einem Sessel oder einem Stamm oder ähnlichem Hilfsgegenstand angebracht sieht. Ich sah nun, dass die Figur also wieder ganz in ihrer alten Haltung sass, in der das Krückstockendchen nicht mehr abgebrochen wirkte, da man das längere Ende des Stockes wie bei einer Plastik, als hinter dem Stuhl verborgen, einfach nicht sehen konnte. - Ausser dem alten Herrn und mir befanden sich noch zwei Jungens im Saal. Der eine schien mir wie zur Oberwelt zu gehören. Er war etwas wie ein kleiner Phantast, der dort zwischen den Gerippen herumforschte. Der andere aber war dort unten zuhause, obwohl lebendig. Er schien so etwas wie ein Hausmeisterssohn zu sein, hatte einen runden Kugelkopf und war etwas stupide, wenn nicht gar schwachsinnig. Darum versuchte der andere Junge, sich von ihm fernzuhalten. Ich sah sie beide durch den Raum laufen. Der kleine Phantast wollte wieder nach draussen in die Oberwelt und der Rundkopf lief hinter ihm her, wohl um ihn zu halten und rief "Passt nur auf, dass er uns nicht wegläuft, damit er nicht verrät, dass wir das Ei erfunden haben", oder so etwas ähnliches. (Ich kann mich leider nicht mehr ganz scharf besinnen, ob es wirklich das Ei war, oder etwas ähnliches, das sie erfunden hatten, ich glaube aber doch das Ei). 

Später sah ich beide oben auf der Strasse laufen, und zwar trug der kleine Junge jetzt ein blaues Gewand mit langen Hosen (wie ein Indianeranzug - aber sehr leicht) und hüpfte seitwärts auf der Strasse fort wie im Polkaschritt. Gegenüber auf der anderen Strassenseite bewegte sich auf die gleiche Weise der Rundkopf. Beide hatten das Gesicht einander zugekehrt. Der Junge erzählte phantastische Geschichten, von denen ich fast alles vergessen habe. Nur erinnere ich noch, dass er an irgendeinem Platz, wie Kinder es sich oft vornehmen, etwas aufbauen und lebendig werden lassen wollte, was an irgendeine historische germanische Vorzeit erinnerte. Die Attribute dazu hatte er sich aus jenem Knochenkabinett gemaust, es waren irgendwelche wichtigen Teile von Wotans Pferd und eine grosse germanische Rundbrosche und anderes. - Überhaupt hatte sein ganzes Vorhaben Ähnlichkeit mit dem Unternehmen einer prähistorischen Ausgrabung und auch der Platz, den er gewählt hatte, stand mit solchen Dingen im Zusammenhang.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0066 (1949-04-30 - Göttingen)Ich bin im Kellergeschoss eines grossen, kasernenartigen Gebäudes. Dort begegnen mir Figuren aus meiner Militärzeit. Ein kleiner, elastischer Wachtmeister, der mir gut gefiel, kommt seitlich aus einem Gang, der das Gebäude der Länge nach durchläuft. Er war Westfale, doch erscheint er hier im Traum als Italiener. Ich mache einen Unteroffizier nach, der durch seine eckigen Gebärden und eine bullerige, etwas lispelnde Sprache besonders komisch wirkte. Nachher steht er selbst in seinem Diensteifer vor mir. Ich versuche, die räumlichen Zusammenhänge dieses Kellergeschosses wiederzuerkennen. Ich selbst befinde mich in einem Gang, der quer zu dem andern (also die kurze Seite des Gebäudes) durchschneidet. Doch kann ich ihm nicht einfach folgen, dort wo er den andern Gang überkreuzt, denn er ist durch zwei Glastüren abgesperrt, zwischen denen neuerdings ein Extraraum gebildet ist, den ich noch nicht kenne und der etwas Unheimliches hat. Der Eintritt ist verboten. Der Gang führt in einem Halbkreis drum herum. Inzwischen hat sich die Szene gewandelt. Ich bin nun in einer grossen Gemeinschaftsküche. Ich habe dort ein grosses Gefäss mit Kuchenteig abzugeben. Dazu klettere ich barfuss auf den Küchentisch. Das ist so üblich. Auch erkenne ich den Koch wieder, der zu mir kommt, um den Teig zu übernehmen. Er kommt gerade zu mir auf den Tisch geklettert. Auch das andere Personal kenne ich. Es sind die Mädchen aus Wittwoldt. - Aber er klettert noch einmal von der Tischkante herunter, um jemandem zu helfen, der seitlich eine Treppe herauf und dann hinter dem Vorhang zum Vorschein kommt. Ich höre den Namen Hella, bin aber erstaunt, nur einen Boy zu sehen in langen, getreiften Hosen und ebensolcher Bluse, die Haare allerdings hochgesteckt wie in einer weiblichen Frisur. Dann erst begreife ich, dass das kesse Mädchen sich so sehr in diese Rolle hineingespielt hatte, dass man sie zunächst nicht wiedererkennt. Als ich nachher auf dem Fliesenfussboden der Küche bei den andern Mädchen stehe und schon im Begriff, wieder zu gehen, da ich meinen Auftrag erfüllt habe, ist da noch ein anderes Mädchen, das ich vom Volkstanz her kenne, nicht sonderlich hübsch und etwas merkwürdig - aber auch nicht direkt schlecht aussehend. Sie möchte noch meine Hilfe in Anspruch nehmen und ich gewähre sie ihr ungern. Sie sagt, oben auf Station gibt es noch viel zu tun. (Wir sind also jetzt in einem Krankenhaus). Ich frage, was es denn zu tun gibt. Sie lächelt. Die anderen Mädchen lächeln auch. Ich begreife schon, worum es sich handelt. Sie sagt: Oben vor den Türen stehen lauter Pöttchen. Während wir noch so sprechen, kommt unsere Volkstanzlehrerin mit mehreren anderen Mädchen in einem sportlichen Anzug und ganz sportlichem Gebahren von der Seite herein. Die Mädchen, mit denen ich auf einem Haufen stehe, sind jetzt auch alle vom Volkstanz. Ich schaue den Ankommenden entgegen und sie mustern mich mit strengen Blicken - halb im Scherz. Die Anführerin tritt mir entgegen und ich sage - ebenfalls im Scherz - "Huh, ein Mann im Nonnenkloster", versuche aber dabei, meine Rolle ernsthaft zu spielen, verschwinde schnell hinter einem Vorhang, der gerade neben mir ist, und hinter dem es unmittelbar eine Treppe hinabgeht, deren Stufen ich hinabsteige, während ich noch mit dem Oberkörper in den Raum hinein rage und es mir noch nicht ganz gelingt, mich hinter dem Vorhang zu verbergen. Dabei wird der Scherz fast zum Ernst und ich erwache mit dem spannenden und unheimlichen Gefühl einer C.F. Meyerschen Novelle. (559 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0067 (1949-05-01 - Göttingen)Ich hatte ein Fernlastauto quer durch Deutschland über grosse Strecken zu fahren. Dafür, dass ich das erste Mal am Steuer sass, ging es ganz gut. Ich versuchte sorgfältig, mit den Füssen Gashebel und Bremshebel auseinander zu halten und gewann mit der Zeit eine gewisse Sicherheit in ihrer Unterscheidung. Einmal, als ich nach hinten gegangen war, um etwas zu erledigen, hatte ich den Wagen so stehenlassen, dass er in einem von Strassenbahnschienen gebildeten Dreieck stand. Die vorbeikommenden Bahnen konnten gerade an ihm vorbeistreifen, doch einmal erfasste ihn ein breiterer Wagen und schleppte ihn ein Stück mit. Ich eilte nach vorne und konnte nun in der Aufregung die Hebel nicht richtig unterscheiden. Ich fragte meinen Beifahrer, dessen Antwort mir aber offensichtlich Unkenntnis zeigte. Er hielt die Gangschaltung für den Bremshebel. In dem Gefühl der Überlegenheit meines Wissens beruhigte ich mich wieder und konnte nun die einzelnen Hebel richtig handhaben und ein Unglück verhüten. 

Zweite Traumszene: Ich war mit einem Schiff in Amerika angekommen. Nun wusste ich nicht, wohin. Zunächst versuchte ich, mein Gepäck bei der Aufbewahrung abzugeben. Dabei liess ich meine Brieftasche liegen. Dann wollte ich meine beiden deutschen Reisebegleiter nach dem Weg fragen. Doch zwischen den vielen Menschen, die dort waren, wurde ich unsicher im Wiedererkennen und alle, die ich anredete, antworteten mir auf Englisch, das ich nicht verstand, und machten sich über mich lustig. Ich ging nun zur Gepäckaufbewahrung zurück, um meine vergessene Brieftasche zu holen. Der Mann wollte sie unterschlagen, doch ich wies ihm nach, wo sie hingefallen sein müsste und bekam sie wieder. Nun beschloss ich, den Konsul eines kleinen europäischen Landes, der mit mir gereist war, um weiteren Rat zu fragen, und erkundigte mich nach dem Konsulat seines Landes. Allein, dort war er nicht bekannt und nie angekommen. - Später fand ich mich in einer Art Werkstattraum wieder, in dem zwei Männer grossen, würfelförmigen, gemauerten Ofen, wie einem Backofen, beschäftigt waren. Es war eine unheimliche Umgebung und ich vermutete hier den Konsul. Durch eine unvorsichtige Bemerkung des einen Gesellen, etwa des Wortlauts "die nackten Füsse in einem Gefäss mit kaltem Wasser sitzt er dort unten in der Glut", erfuhr ich, dass der Konsul dort seit langem gefoltert wurde und noch immer am Leben war. Der eine Geselle wollte mich aus dem Fenster werfen, als ich Anstalten machte, an den Ofen heranzukommen. Es gelang ihm aber irgendwie nicht.

Dritte Traumszene: Ich sass in einem Filmatelier und las dort Bücher. Später schaute ich aus dem Fenster meines Zimmers, das ich dort bewohnte. Unter mir dehnte sich ein flaches Dach, wie bei einer Fabrikanlage. Es überdachte die eigentlichen Atelierräume. Dort kuckte aus einer Dachlucke ein Mann, von dem ich nicht wusste, ob es der Regisseur selber oder eine andere wichtige Persönlichkeit sei. Er sagte zu mir: "was wollen Sie eigentlich hier. Sie sitzen immer und lesen ihre Bücher. In die Räume des Ateliers sind Sie noch nie gekommen, andere Menschen, wenn sie hier sind, lassen sich alles von uns zeigen - das kann ich verstehen; aber Sie sind hier ganz sinnlos." Ich wollte ihm sehr von oben herab etwas antworten, da ich mich ihm turmhoch überlegen fühlte. Dann erwachte ich und malte mir noch im Halbwachen eine gesalzene Antwort aus. (530 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0068 (1949-06-02 - Göttingen)[Vorbemerkung: Der Traum kommt zeitlich nach seinem Datum erst nach dem folgenden Traum Nr. 69, ist aber versehentlich schon lange als Nr. 68 gezählt worden, so dass die Zählung auch so bleiben muss.] 

Ich ging durch eine zertrümmerte Stadt, doch waren die Trümmer schön und von grosser Form. In einer Strasse hatte sich das alte Ruinenbild verändert. Eine Kirche, die aus einem anmutigen Rund von Säulen und einer Kuppel bestand, die man ehedem hoch über sich schweben sah, war gleichsam auseinandergenommen und in mehreren Höhendurchschnitten flach auf den Boden gesetzt, so dass die Kuppel direkt vor einem auf der Strasse stand, ohne doch etwas von dem Eindruck der Höhe eingebüsst zu haben. Es war, als sei das ganze Kunstwerk in seine letzten Urelemente aufgelöst worden. Um die ganze Trümmerstätte zog sich ein Kranz von feinen Rauchsäulen. Sie rührten von den Explosionen her, die jene Sprengung veranlasst hatte. Ich ging mit grosser Eile, denn ich fürchtete, dass Gebäude könne über mich zusammenstürzen. Dabei lief ich mich in eine kleine Sackgasse fest, in die der Fusssteig sich in einer Trümmerbarriere verlief. So war ich auf drei Seiten von kleinen Schuttwänden umgeben, über die ich aber ohne Mühe hinwegklettern könnte, wenn nicht zwei Hunde mir den Weg verstellt hätten. Ich wagte nicht, den Sprung zu machen, weil mich die Hunde dann angesprungen hätten. Schliesslich stieg ich in eine Strassenbahn. Sie setzte sich in Bewegung, ehe ich wieder aussteigen konnte. An der nächsten Haltestelle suchte ich wieder hinauszukommen, ohne Geld bezahlt zu haben. Der Schaffner wollte mir einen verbilligten Preis machen. Schliesslich war er aber verschwunden und ich stand allein auf der Strasse. Neben mir war ein kleines, altes Kloster. Es war im gotischen Stil, aber architektonisch nicht sehr gelungen. Ich wollte noch einmal in den Strassenbahnwagen zurück. Doch als ich die Tür öffnete, geriet ich in das Kloster. Ich hörte drinnen die Stimmen von Nonnen und kehrte sofort um. Ich ging die Strasse fort, die wieder eine Sackgasse wurde. Am Ende sassen in einer romantischen Umgebung die Madonna von den Sieben Monden und der Räuber Nino, zwei Figuren aus einem englischen Film. Ich setzte mich zu ihnen zum Essen und genoss die Freiheit. Sie waren hier gleichsam privat, und bei allem, was sie taten - ob sie sich nun das Brot reichten, oder irgend etwas anderes taten - machten sie feine, humorvolle Anspielungen auf ihren Film. Schliesslich gingen wir zusammen auf die Strasse. Sie entschuldigte sich, dass sie nur Sandalen ohne Strümpfe trüge und ich sagte, dass ich dasselbe auch täte und froh darüber sei. (389 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0069 (1949-05-15 - Göttingen)Ich sass in einem grossen Raum und hörte Musik. Dann sah ich das Orchester spielen: Die Geigen bewegten sich alle im gleichen Takt, sehr schnell. Plötzlich sah ich, wie die Fanfaren aufgehoben wurden. Dann kam ein Stoss - so gewaltig, dass ich aufspringen wollte, wie man in der Kirche zum Gebet tut, und sah, wie noch ein paar andere Leute, die in den leeren Bankreihen sassen, dasselbe wollten, dann aber sitzenblieben, da sie ebenso wie ich im Aufblicken, wie aus einem Traum erwachend, merkten, dass sie ja nur in einem Konzertsaal waren. Es war Bachsche Musik. (Als ich erwachte, war Gewitter. Als ich mich niedergelegt hatte, war es schon sehr schwül gewesen. In den Ohren klangen mir die Melodien der 5. Symphonie von Beethoven, die mein Nachbar vorher lange auf dem Klavier gespielt hatte.) (134 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0070 (1949-05-22 - Göttingen)Ein grosser, junger Schäferhund auf einer Strasse. Gegenüber das Wohnhaus und daneben eine Baracke, in der ich nachts mit ihm schlafen sollte. Ich wollte den Hund über die Strasse locken und er erhob sich sofort, als ich sagte "Steh auf". - Als ich ihn aber mit Namen rief "Angka, komm", setzte er sich wieder und wurde immer störrischer. Schliesslich wollte er überhaupt nicht mehr und ich hörte, wie er in sich dachte "Jetzt bleib ich einfach sitzen". Er wollte mich beissen und mein anfängliches Überlegenheitsgefühl brach völlig in sich zusammen und wich der Angst. Einmal hörte ich auch in der Ferne ein Auto, so dass ich fürchten musste, er könne auf der Strasse überfahren werden. Plötzlich kullerte von hinten ein dunkler Gummireifen heran und traf den Hund im Rücken. Ich dachte: Was soll die Albernheit, das haben sicher die Kinder getan. Dann sah ich, wie der Reifen sich zur Schlange auseinanderrollte, die den Hund beissen wollte, und erkannte, dass diese Tiere sich auf solche Weise unerkannt an ihre Beute heranmachen. Auch wurde mir klar, dass die Schlange schon früher den Hund gebissen haben müsse, weswegen er so störrisch war. Doch war ich wie gebannt und wusste nicht, wie ich die Schlange töten sollte. Ich erwachte noch wie gelähmt von diesem Bann und ganz befangen von der Einsicht in etwas Furchtbares und zugleich heimlich Erregendes. In der nächsten Bewusstseinsstufe erschien mir das lachende Gesicht von einem Mädchen mit einem Mozartzopf, das ich zu einem Fest eingeladen hatte, und als ich die Augen ganz öffnete, schien das Bild der Maria aus dem Englischen Gruss an der Stirnwand meines Bettes ganz belebt, als wenn ein Schleier sich von dem Gesicht lösen und etwas von ihm ausströmen wollte, wie es dies eigentlich nur nach sehr schönen Träumen tut und wie es genau auch das Gesicht tat, nach dessen Ähnlichkeit ich einstmals das Bild ausgewählt hatte. (Gemeint ist Ika. Der englische Gruss ist von Veit Stoss. Das ursprüngliche Gesicht: Eli). (325 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0071 (1949-06-10 - Göttingen)Ort der Handlung: Unsere Wohnung in Schwerin. - Personen: Vater und Emmi. Es war eine Unstimmigkeit gewesen. Ich hatte irgendwelches Geschirr zerbrochen. Nun sollte ich den Tisch decken und ging aus irgend einem Grunde über den Flur in die Küche, nachdem ich vorher im Tellerschrank gesucht hatte. - Die Wut stieg so in mir hoch, dass ich auf dem Flur gehend sagte: "Jetzt schmeiss ich einen Teller kaputt". Dann nahm ich den Teller, den ich in der Hand hatte, und zerknackte ihn am Boden. Vater und Emmi, die es gehört hatten, kamen entsetzt von innen heraus. Es kam zu einer Auseinandersetzung, die damit endete, dass Vater zu mir sagte: "Von der Rute will ich absehen" - ich unterbrach ihn: "das will ich mir auch verbeten haben" - "aber Du bekommst heute abend nichts mehr zu essen". Ich sagte: "Weisst Du überhaupt, seit wann ich heute nichts mehr zu essen gehabt habe" - denn ich hatte seit dem frühen Vormittag nichts mehr gegessen - "aber das ist ja auch ganz nebensächlich", dachte und sagte ich dann, und es fiel mir auch ein, dass ich vor dem Konzert abends ein wenig gegessen hatte. - Ich ging in mein Zimmer (hinauslaufen mochte ich nicht, denn ich wollte doch wenigstens irgendwie von Emmi getröstet werden können, obwohl ich auch wütend auf sie war). Im Zimmer trommelte ich mit den Fäusten an die Wand und trampelte gleichzeitig mit den Füssen auf den Boden, bis ich erwachte. (241 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0072 (1949-06-19 - Göttingen)Ich liege nachts in meinem Bett und beobachte durch das offene Fenster auf dem Dach des gegenüberliegenden Hauses einen starken Funkenflug an einer elektrischen Leitung, den ich für feuergefährlich halte. Er sieht aus wie das Bild einer mehrfach verästelten, kleinen Blitzbahn auf dem Hintergrund eines schwarzen Nachthimmels. Ich will mit meinem Brunder darüber sprechen, doch der ist so müde und schon im Einschlafen, dass er mich nur immer bittet, endlich nicht mehr mit ihm zu sprechen, und meine Worte nicht mehr begreift. Wenn ich meine Nachttischlampe ausschalte, sehe ich drüben den Funkenflug noch stärker. Daran merke ich, dass das Brennen meiner Lampe nicht die Ursache sein kann. Endlich nach langer Zeit geht drüben in einem Zimmer unter dem Dach das Licht an. Die Einwohner müssen das Knistern über sich bemerkt haben und schicken sich an, zu löschen. Ich bin mir im Zweifel, ob man einen so elektrisch verursachten Schaden durch einfaches Löschen beseitigen kann. Dann sehe ich ein kleines Mädchen mit Zöpfen und Haarschleifen auf dem Dach erscheinen. Ich werde von einer furchtbaren Angst befallen, das Mädchen könne vom Dach stürzen, und kann nicht mehr hinsehen, sondern verberge den Kopf in der Bettdecke und muss auf einmal beten. Ich wundere mich selbst darüber. Es ist jetzt dunkel geworden, das Mädchen ist wieder in seiner Stube und hat das Licht gelöscht. Doch schon nach kurzer Zeit - wie ich befürchtet hatte, werden die Funken wieder sichtbar. Nun erscheint Vater und ich flehe ihn an, die Feuerwehr zu benachrichtigen, aber er ist mit anderen Dingen beschäftigt und hat kein Ohr für mich. Schliesslich sagt er "Ach, lass mich in Frieden, ich kann den Kerl nicht leiden", denn er hat eine Antipathie gegen den Mann, der da zu benachrichtigen wäre. Stattdessen trägt er nur schöne Geburtstagsgeschenke herum, um mich zu beruhigen, Kinderspielzeug und rote Spielbaukästen. Ich bin tief verzweifelt, dass er mich so wenig ernst nimmt und ganz wie ein Kind behandelt und sage, ob es denn gleichgültig sei, ob das Haus dort drüben morgen früh noch stände oder abgebrannt wäre und ob diese anderen Dinge etwa wichtiger seien.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0073 (1949-06-20 - Göttingen)Erster Traum: Ich träumte innerhalb weiterer Zusammenhänge von einer elektrisch geladenen Weckeruhr, von der Blitze ausgingen. Es war der Taschenwecker meines Bruders. (22 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0074 (1949-06-20 - Göttingen)Onkel Adolf arbeitete als Konsistorialrat in der deutschen Kirchenregierung. Diese war auf dem Lande untergebracht. Ich wohnte auf dem selben Gut und wollte ihn in seinem Arbeitszimmer besuchen, um ihm irgendeine belanglose Bestellung auszurichten. Ich erstaunte, als ich sah, dass die ganze Kirchenleitung in einem winzigen, verfallenen und verbauten Häuschen, wohl einem ausgebauten Hühnerhaus, untergebracht war. Der Portier sagte mir, er könne mich leider jetzt nicht einlassen und fragte nach meinem Namen. Dann aber kam er nach einer Weile wieder und sagte: Bitte treten Sie ein, Herr Kapitän Lieutenant. Er wies mich eine kleine Treppe hoch, dort eine Tür am Korridor links. Als ich dort versuchte, hineinzukommen, sagte mir eine Frau, von hier aus würde ich das Zimmer schlecht erreichen, ich würde besser von aussen hereinkommen, wenn ich hinten um das Haus herum ginge. Ich tat dies und fand dort schliesslich über einer kleinen, fensterartigen Öffnung an einem Fachwerkbalken des primitiven Mauerbaus die betreffende Zimmernummer eingeritzt. Die Fensteröffnung war zu ebener Erde, wie ein Kellerfenster, und mit Balken und Steinen verstellt wie bei einem Luftschutzkeller. Als ich die Steine fortgeräumt hatte, merkte ich, dass die Fensteröffnung nur in das oberste Ende des viel tiefer liegenden Raumes, in dem Onkel Adolf sass, hineinragte und ausserdem noch vergittert sei. Ich stellte mir vor, dass es mir unmöglich sei, mich da hindurchzuzwängen, und rief Adolf an. Dieser war sehr verstört über die Störung seiner umgebenden Ordnung und bedeutete mir, dass ich so nicht hereinkönne, eine Tür sei weiter links. - Schliesslich bemerkte ich nach langem Suchen, dass die zweite Tür weiter links auf einem weiteren Umwege in das Zimmer führe und erwachte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0075 (1949-06-21 - Göttingen)Ich blätterte in einem alten Buch und las viele Gedichte und Gedanken, die Vater bei seinen Lebzeiten mit der Schreibmaschine aufgeschrieben hatte. Ich fand dabei Gedanken wieder aus den Gesprächen, die er mit mir geführt hatte, als ich etwa 16 Jahre alt war und wir uns Abende lang über religiöse Dinge unterhielten, wobei die Meinungen scharf aufeinander platzten. - Dann las ich alte Briefe aus der Zeit unserer Grossväter und sah sie vergleichsweise mit Briefen unserer Zeit über die selben Gegenstände. Dabei nun sah ich, dass man damals alles religiös ausgedrückt hatte, was man heute einfach ohne Einkleidung beschrieb - doch hörte ich diese Briefe zwar, sah sie aber nicht, sondern ich sah etwas wie den Prozess ihrer inneren Entstehung. Es waren grosse Kästen, die in mehrere Abteilungen eingeteilt waren, welche mit irgendeinem Stoff angefüllt waren, dessen Oberfläche fest und verkrustet war, wie bei einem lange nicht bearbeiteten Gartenland in trockener Zeit. Durch den Vorgang nun, in dem die Briefe entstanden und den ich wörtlich als den Inhalt der Briefe vernahm, wurde dieser Stoff von innen aufgewühlt und wie beim Pflügen aufgebrochen, bis am Ende eine feste Form zurückblieb. - 

Das Ganze hatte etwas Ähnlichkeit mit den technischen Darstellungen im Film, die von den Worten des Ansagers begleitet werden. Ich empfand eine innere Beruhigung, als ich im Vergleich der Briefe merkte, dass man damals alles in religiöser Einkleidung ausgedrückt hatte, was man heute einfach als Beschreibung der Sachlage sagt, denn das zeigte mir, dass meine eigene Tendenz nur einem allgemeinen geschichtlichen Prozesse folgt. (Zeit des Traums: Gegen Morgen, kurz vor dem Erwachen, während schon mein Bruder beim Aufstehen war.) (269 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0076 (1949-06-21 - Göttingen)Kurz vorher hatte ich einen längeren Traum. Ich lag noch im Bett, während mein Bruder schon aufgestanden war und in der Stube wirkte. Mit ihm wirkte dort Tante Pinchen aus Wittmoldt. Es wurde immer später und ich gab mich sinnlichen Vorstellungen hin. Wenn sie an mein Bett kam, stellte ich mich schlafend. Schliesslich machte sie der Sache ein Ende, in dem sie mir einen Fliegenschirm über den Unterleib setzte und etwas von der Verderbtheit der Jugend sagte und ein Sprüchlein, etwa "Schlechte Gedanken verderben gute Sitten". - Ich bequemte mich nun, aufzustehen, doch wie ich auch den Wandschirm um den Waschtisch stellen wollte, immer fiel er um oder schirmte die Blicke entweder zum Fenster oder zur Tür hin nicht richtig ab. - Endlich kam Erna - der Hausgeist meiner hiesigen Verwandten - in die Stube. Ich rief: Das geht jetzt noch nicht. Sie aber sagte: "Das muss ich jetzt unbedingt haben" und holte aus der Stube das Kehrblech und den Besen. In diesem Traum und während des langen Liegens am Morgen darin geisterten Bilder aus einer grossen Gebirgstour, von der ich geträumt hatte. (Gleich folgender Traum Nr. 77). (188 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0077 (1949-06-21 - Göttingen)[In diesem Traum - Nr. 76 - und während des langen Liegens am Morgen darin, geisterten Gedanken und Bilder aus einer Gebirgstour, von der ich vorher geträumt hatte:] Ich sah die einzelnen Kirchtürme zwischen den Bergen und versuchte, mich zu besinnen, zu welchen Dörfern und Städten sie gehörten, durch die ich vorher gekommen war. Dabei dauerte es manchmal lange, bis die richtigen Namen mir einfielen, und ich erinnere mich, dass einzelne Namen einen Klang hatten, der dem der Dörfer und Städte in den slovakischen Gebirgen ähnlich war, die wir gegen Ende des Krieges durchzogen. 

- Die Türme, die ich zwischen den Bergen sah, waren teilweise sehr schön. Mir schwebt noch ein sehr flüssiger, fürstlich geformter Barockturm vor, der irgendwo sehr hoch in den Bergen aus einem kleinen Teil empor - ja, er reckte sich nicht, er zeigte auch nicht, er wuchs mit jener Leichtigkeit und Flüssigkeit und mit jener Würde und Serenität, mit der ganzen Präsenz, die uns heiter stimmt, wie sie nur barocke Bauwerke haben. Er stammte aus einem kleinen, breitstrassigen Flecken, der jenen wohlklingenden slovakischen Namen trug. (151 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0078 (1949-06-22 - Göttingen)Heute nacht träumte ich von Maria Reichardt. Ich traf sie plötzlich auf der Strasse, nachdem ich schon einige Tage wusste, dass sie hier war. Sie hakte mich ein und wir gingen eine Weile. Dann musste ich mich wieder verabschieden, weil in diesen Tagen meine Schwester zu Besuch war, die am Abend wieder fortfuhr, und die zur Bahn zu bringen ich versprochen hatte. - Das nächste Mal ging ich mit einer Medizinerin an dem Haus vorbei, in dem Maria wohnte. Wir hörten sie ein Kinderlied singen und sahen sie dann zum Fenster hinaus schauen. Ich zeigte sie ihr. Dann rief ich Maria zu, ich wolle sie nachher noch besuchen. Das war ihr zuerst nicht recht. Als sie aber erfuhr, dass ich dazu nicht extra mit der Strassenbahn fahren brauchte, war sie sehr erfreut. - Im Fortgehen fragte ich die Medizinerin, was sie von ihr gefunden hätte; da erfuhr ich, "sie hat Augen wie ein Arzt". Sie hatte sich in ihr angesprochen gefühlt. (161 words)

Zunächst war es sehr viel Polizei. Es fand gerade ein Wachablösung statt. Dann blieb nur ein Posten zurück, der aber ein grosses Gerät aufgebaut hatte, mit dem alle Passanten photographiert wurden. - Da ich nicht herein kam, beschloss ich, Gisela in ihrer Wohnung zu besuchen, da ich sie seit der Rückkehr von ihrer Reise noch nicht gesehen hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0081 (1949-06-26 - Göttingen)Ich traf mit I. (Ika) zusammen auf dem Lande. Wir verbrachten eine Nacht zusammen, halb schlafend, halb in besinnlichem Gespräch, zwar in enger Berührung, doch ohne einen Verkehr, um eine innere Grenze nicht zu überschreiten, die wir uns ohne Worte gesetzt hatten. - 

Zweite Traumszene: Ich hatte von Emmi den Auftrag, einen Sommeranzug für meinen Bruder zu besorgen. Ausserdem Knöpfe und einiges andere. Ich ging in ein Warenhaus und forderte Knöpfe. Unter der vorgelegten Auswahl fand ich durch Zufall solche, die der etwas seltenen Knopfsorte an meinem Regenmantel entsprachen. Nur schienen sie mir ein ganz wenig kleiner. Ich zählte in Gedanken aus, wieviele ich brauchen würde, doch da nicht so viele vorhanden waren, trug mir der Mann nun ähnliche heran in anderen Grössen bis hin zu der Grösse eines kleinen Bilderrahmens. Plötzlich bemerkte ich, dass ich den Regenmantel mit den alten Knöpfen ja gerade an hatte und konnte nun direkt vergleichen und auswählen. Dann erwarb ich einen gestreiften Anzug für meinen Bruder. - Erst später auf dem Wege merkte ich, dass ich in dem Halbdunkel und bei meiner Farbenblindheit einen kakelbunten Anzug gekauft hatte. Ich kehrte um und fuhr mit einer alten Frau im Kuller-Wagen die Strase bergab. Sie war es gewohnt, diese Strecke zu fahren und fuhr mit einer solchen Geschwindigkeit, dass wir am Schluss, als wir vor dem Gebäude ankamen- es hatte Ähnlichkeit mit dem Göttinger Bahnhof - mitten in die Bauarbeiter hineinfuhren, die dort die Strasse ausbesserten. Ich konnte aber so steuern, dass wir niemand anfuhren und nur über einige Eimer und Gefässe hinfuhren, die aber zwischen den Rädern Platz hatten. Vor dem Eingang waren Schwarzhändler. Ich ging in das Warenhaus mit dem Mann, der den Anzug verkauft hatte. Es war schon nach Geschäftsschluss und drinnen wachte ein Polizist. Der Mann verschwand und sagte: "Wenden Sie sich an meine Agenten". - Das Innere des Hauses hatte die Gestalt eines Museums, in dem sich die Schwarzhändler herumtrieben. Der Unauffälligkeit halber blieb ich noch eine Weile sitzen, als ob ich ein Gemälde betrachte. Der Polizist schnappte hier und da einen Schwarzhändler, ging aber an mir vorbei. Ich wurde unruhig und stand auf. Dadurch wurde er auf mich aufmerksam, kam auf mich zu, legte den Arm um mich und sagte: "Na, Junge, auch was verbrochen, komm auch mal mit in den Wagen". - Ich sagte: "Das, glaube ich, wird nicht nötig sein", verschwieg ihm aber die kleine Unrechtmässigkeit mit den Agenten, um unnötige Komplikationen zu vermeiden. Er schaute mir in die Augten und sagte: "Du bist mir gleich aufgefallen durch Deinen tiefen, dunklen Blick" - Er selber hatte strahlende, blaue Augen - "dann mach aber keinen Unsinn.". Er liess mich wieder gehen, nachdem er meinen Namen erfragt hatte, und ich ging und beschloss, nicht zu den Agenten zu gehen, sondern meinen Bruder morgen in der Geschäftszeit den Anzug tauschen zu lassen.

Traum am folgenden Tag (29.6.1949): Ich war mit Ika zusammen. Ich nannte sie Du und umarmte sie und küsste sie. Dabei fiel mir auf, wie eiskalt ihr Mund war und wie schmal ihre ganze Figur und doch wie kraftvoll ihre Leidenschaft. (75 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0084 (1949-06-30 - Göttingen)Ich war auf dem Lande zur Gartenarbeit. Auf der Suche nach Hacke und Harke geriet ich in eine Baracke. as Dach, das über ihre Aufgangstreppe gezogen war, so niedrig, dass ich nur gebückt gehen konnte und gezwungen war, mich irgendwo festzuhalten. Ich nahm an, es sei der Speiseraum der Gärtner und ekelte mich sehr. Später merkte ich, dass es sich um einen Schweinestall handeln musste. Die Gartenanlage selbst war von einem neuen Gärtner in romantischer Weise mit Palmen aufgezogen. In der Baracke sah ich einen alten Mann als Schweinemeister, der sich gerade auskleidete. Er hatte Ähnlichkeit mit der Dürerschen Figur des verlorenen Sohnes unter den Schweinen. Im Anfang des Traumes spielte Frau v. Bülow aus Wittmoldt eine Rolle, die mich zur Arbeit schickte. Später erschien Frau v.Oertzen, Roggow. (128 words)

Doch verwunderte ich mich, dass meine Hausnachbarn dort grosse Vorkehrungen trafen. Sie hatten Tische mit Kuchen aufgestellt und bauten Spaliere an die Wand. Auf den Gartenwegen liefen kleine Hunde, die mich ansprangen. Als ich mit einem spielte, biss er mich in den Finger. Als ich ihn darauf, sehr enttäuscht, genauer ansah, entdeckte ich, dass es ein sehr hässlicher, mopsköpfiger Hund war, über dessen Hinterlist ich mich nicht wundern konnte. (81 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0087 (1949-07-13 - Göttingen)Ich war bei Emmis alten Eltern. Vatting bastelte in seiner Werkstatt, Mudding las laut aus Büchern, die sie zwar in geistiger Wirre nicht mehr verstehen konnte, aus deren Worten und Zusammenhängen man sich aber den Sinn konstruieren konnte. Der kleine Enkel machte allerhand Streiche in einer Art Jungensbande und hatte dabei Geld gegen irgendwelche Dinge getauscht und grosse Verluste gemacht. - Emmi führte mich auf den Boden. Doch war der Weg dorthin nicht nur ein Treppenhaus und ein langer Flur, sondern zugleich winklige Strassen, die in eine lange grade mündeten (welche ja früher den Weg zu Muddings Wohnung gebildet hatten). Ich konnte mich nicht mehr ganz zurecht finden und fragte Emmi etwas. Sie sagte "Das weisst Du doch" - aber ich wunderte mich, dass jetzt in den Dimensionen alles viel kleiner schien, was mir als Kind gross erschienen war. Auf dem Boden war Vatting in seiner Werkstatt. Er führte mich zu den Jungens der Bande, zu denen der kleine Enkelsohn gehörte. Ich war verwundert, lauter grössere Jungens zu finden. Sie hatten sich eine Art Werkstatt aus Holzbänken gebaut, in der sie mit grossen Mauernägeln hantieren, die alle in gleicher Reihe dort lagen. Ich war erstaunt über die grosse Solidarität, mit der sie alle zusammenhielten. Sie hielten etwas wie eine eigene Gerichtsbarkeit, mit der sie über den Jungen urteilten. Ich sagte ihnen, dass er noch viel zu klein für ihre Masstäbe sei, sie seien doch schliesslich alle grössere Jungens. Sie antworteten, er sei doch alt genug, daran, dass er körperlich so klein sei, sei ich dann ja Schuld, denn sie hielten mich für den Vater. Ich klärte sie in dem Irrtum auf. (271 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0088 (1949-07-14 - Göttingen)Ich wurde von vielen Tieren, Katzen und Hunden, angesprungen, die ich vergeblich abzuschütteln suchte. Es war in einer ländlichen Umgebung und auch die Hilfe anderer Menschen vermochte nicht, mich von den Tieren zu befreien, die mir bis in den Nacken krochen. - 

Zweite Traumszene: Ich war als Wärter auf einem Leuchtturm. Es war eine militärische Situation. Während ich früher diesen Posten ohne weiteres hatte ausfüllen können, bekam ich nun auf einmal Schwindelgefühle, denn der neue Leuchtturm war überhaupt nicht richtig im Boden verankert und seine Plattform war viel zu klein. Ich kämpfte mit äusserster Konzentration dagegen, ohne die Schwindelgefühle loszuwerden. Schliesslich entschloss ich mich, hinab zu klettern, obwohl ich von den Umstehenden die Worte gehört hatte: "da ist einer, der simuliert nur". Um herab zu kommen, musste ich mit dem Kopf zuerst durch ein kleines Fenster kriechen, wobei der ganze Leuchtturm ins Wanken geriet. Dann rutschte ich innen in dem blanken Stahlgehäuse in grosser Eile und ohne Mühe hinab, bis ich festen Boden unter den Füssen hatte.

Dritte Szene: Ich sah nun ein Feuerschiff im Meer und hörte gleichzeitig das Geräusch der Funkgeräte und einzelne Bruchstücke der gesendeten Sprüche. Es handelte sich um eine Situation, in der die Besatzung in Not war und der Sohn, der die Besatzung führte, auf Befehl seines Vaters, des Leuchtturmwärters, an Bord bleiben musste. Dann wandelte sich die Szene bei gleicher Situation: Es war eine Luftwarnzentrale: eine grosse Halle mit vielen uniformierten Menschen zwischen einem Gewirr von Kabeln und Nachrichtengeräten. Sie übermittelten ihre Nachrichten mit grosser Präzision, doch durch einen Luftangriff kamen sie in grosse Gefahr und bekamen den Befehl, den Saal zu räumen und in einen Luftschutzkeller überzusiedeln. Doch hörte ich dabei Stimmen im Hintergrund: "Die werden in Sicherheit gebracht und durch die Unzuverlässigkeit eines provisorischen Nachrichtennetzes werden dafür Tausende gefährdet." Ich sah sie den Saal verlassen und durch Gänge und Räume fortstürzen. Dann ging der Weg weiter durchs Freie, durch Trümmer und kellerartige offene Steingänge. Man hörte schon das Motorengeräusch der Flugzeuge und dann die ersten Detonationen, bei denen dunkle Sprengwolken ganz in der Nähe aufstiegen. Wir warfen uns platt auf den Boden. Dann galt es, sich durch kleine Fensterlöcher in ein scheinbar unzureichendes, nicht von Häusern überbautes Kellergewölbe zu zwängen, und ich erwachte. (371 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0089 (1949-07-15 - Göttingen)Ich traf beim Baden einen englischen Vetter, einen schon älteren Herrn, der hier einen Verwaltungsposten inne hatte. Ich musste ihn auf dem Heimweg, als ich ihn begrüssen wollte, von hinten ansprechen, denn er ging sehr schnell. Er erschrak sehr und dachte, es solle ein Anschlag auf ihn gemacht werden. Er trug einen steifen Kragen, in dem er etwas altmodisch wirkte, und eine Brille. Dazu hatte er etwas krause Haare und war recht hager. Ich wusste nicht, ob ich ihn nun Du oder Sie nennen sollte, überlegte aber, dass ihm als Engländer dieser Unterschied kaum in die Augen fallen würde. Wir begegneten auf dem Wege zweimal militärischen Leichenbegängnissen der Engländer. Es waren Lafetten mit den Särgen, vor die ein ganzes Feld von Pferden gespannt war. Ich zählte einmal neunzehn Reihen hintereinander. Da sie alle unbemannt waren, wirkte es wie ein ganzes Geflecht von Pferden. Um das Gewicht auf dem abwärtsgeneigten Weg zurückzahalten, war hinter jede Lafette eine Strassenbahn gespannt. Der Engländer erkundigte sich bei einem der hinterher fahrenden Wagen, wer der Gestorbene sei. Es war ein hoher Verwaltungsbeamter und der Vetter wurde sehr bestürzt, denn er hoffte gerade von diesem eine Beförderung in eine höhere Stellung. Ich sah nun die Urkunde, in der für diese schon alles vorbereitet war. (208 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0090 (1949-07-16 - Göttingen)Man hatte neue Methoden zur Förderung des Getreide- und Futter-Anbaus erfunden: kleine Schaufeln wurden den Feldtieren an die Füsse und den Leib gebunden, mit denen sie bei jeder Bewegung den Acker umgruben. Diese Erfindung wurde ausprobiert an einem kleinen Zwerghahn. Es sah sehr putzig aus, wenn er mit seiner Bewaffnung an Krallen und Schnabel auf dem Acker umherlief. Plötzlich kam ein grosser Hahn und hackte auf das Tier ein. Doch unsere Erwartungen wurden nicht enttäuscht, nun einen lustigen Zweikampf zu sehen, denn von den scharfen Werkzeugen des anderen wurde der Angreifer übel zugerichtet. Aber der Zwerghahn, sicher geworden, wurde immer nachlässiger und schliesslich, als er wie ein Pfau triumphierend seine Federn spreitze, hackte der andere zu und schleppte ihn, wie ein Fuchs, der die Gans gestohlen hat, als Beute ab.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0091 (1949-07-16 - Göttingen)Nachmittags: Ich hörte aus einem anderen Zimmer Gisela Klavier spielen in einer wunderbar festen und sicheren Form und meinte, sie an dieser inneren Form der Töne wiederzuerkennen. Ich öffnete eine quietschende Tür in einen kleinen Raum und, wenn ich hinein ging, hörte ich Emmi und meine Schwester sprechen im Nachbarzimmer. Das Klavierspiel aber wurde leiser, wenn ich die Tür hinter mir schloss. Ich hörte Alli (Adelheid) sagen: "Ach, da quietscht schon wieder diese schreckliche Tür" und Emmi in einer sehr durchdringenden und schrillen Stimme antworten: "Ach, Du bist auch zu empfindlich; Wenn ich spreche, sagst Du, es ist zu laut und das Türquietschen stört Dich auch". - Ich öffnete noch einmal die Tür, - wobei sie wieder quietschte -, um die Musik besser hören zu können. Gleichzeitig stellte ich genaue Überlegungen über die Räumlichkeit an, wie es möglich sei, dass ich in diesem Raume das Gespräch besser, die Musik aber schwächer hören konnte, und kam zu dem Schluss, dass neben dieser Kammer noch irgendein Wandschrank oder vielleicht das Gehäuse einer kleinen Treppe sein musste, was sonst den Schall zwischen den beiden Zimmern und jetzt die Schallverbindung zu dem entfernten Raum, aus dem die Musik klang, isolierte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0092 (1949-07-17 - Göttingen)Ich war in einem fremden Land. Doch hörte ich in einem Haus die Geschichte vieler Männer, die nacheinander um eines Mädchens Willen in den Tod gegangen waren. Ich fragte tief erschüttert, ob in allen diesen Schicksalen es jenes Mädchen gewesen sei, das mir dort gegenüber sass. Die Frage wurde bejaht. Ich liebte das Mädchen und heiratete sie. Jeder der Männer hatte nacheinander ein Reis eines anderen Baumes auf einen grünen Zweig aufgepfropft. Ich sagte zu dem Mädchen: wir wollen diesen Zweig in die Erde stecken und wachsen lassen. Er wurde ein grosser Baum. An ihm wuchsen Weiden und Rotdorn und blühende Linden. Ich sah die Frau, als sie ein Kind geboren hatte und sehr glücklich war. Der Junge wurde grösser und sehr ungebärdig. Aber wir freuten uns daran. Er hatte etwas von dem slawischen Temperament ihres Vaters geerbt. Er ging mit kräftigen Schritten auf und ab, hatte wilde, fliegende Haare und forderte ungebärdig, eine fremde Sprache zu lernen. (158 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0093 (1949-07-18 - Göttingen)Ich ging in ein Café und bestellte mir zwei Stücke Kuchen, deren Preis eine geringe Geldsumme nicht überschreiten durfte. Dann setzte ich mich in einen Sessel etwas abseits am Fenster und war erstaunt, wie schnell der Kellner, der mich noch nie gesehen hatte, mich hier finden konnte. Es war dort auch ein älterer Herr, wohl ein abgedankter Offizier, von dessen Arbeit die Rede war. Es stellte sich heraus, dass er ganz primitive Arbeit tun musste. Er hatte ein modriges Wasserbecken auszuschaufeln, das man sehen konnte, wenn man durch das milchig trübe Glasfenster schaute. Ich verliess nun das Café. Ich war Offizier. Es war im Kriege. Ein anderer, sehr zuverlässiger, jüngerer Offizier begleitete mich zur Tür. Es war in einer kleinen, sehr unsicheren Stadt und ich sagte ihm, dass ich vor diesem Gang durch die nächtlichen Gassen dieser Stadt mehr Angst habe, als vor allen Gefahren des Krieges. Er erbot sich sofort, mich zu begleiten, aber ich wies es zurück, da es nur ihn und mich in Gefahr gebracht hätte. Ich ging so schnell wie möglich durch eine schmale, lange Strasse, die auf einem vieleckigen Platz endete. Dann hatte ich meinen Weg zu finden durch eine von zwei schmalen Gassen, die beide auf eine breitere Hauptstrasse führten, in der ich dann vor Überfällen sicher gewesen wäre. Ich wählte die rechte und ging schnell hinein. Dann musste ich links in eine Tür, zu der ich schon den Schlüssel in der Hand hatte. - Da hörte ich in der Ferne die Stimme des jungen Offiziers schallen, der mich begleitet hatte "Donner, Sie sind in der falschen Gasse, Sie müssen die linke wählen". (Ich führte den Namen eines Baron Donner). - Ich drückte den Schlüssel und einen 5-Mark-Schein schnell einem jungen Burschen in die Hand, der schon in der Tür stand und mich überfallen wollte. Dann lief ich so schnell wie möglich zum Platz zurück und bog in die richtige Gasse ein. - Später im Zusammenhang anderer Traumbilder sah ich noch einmal die Konditorei und schaute aus dem Fenster, als ich die Leute sagen hörte "Nun haben sie endlich das Wasser abgelassen". Ich sah, dass das grosse Wasserbecken, das den Hof bildete, leergelaufen und voller Morast war. Der ganze Lichthof, auf den unendliche Fenster mündeten, war überdacht von einem völlig dichten Glasdach wie von einem Oberlichtfenster. Ich stellte mir vor, wie hier eine denkbar ungesunde Luft entstehen musste. (394 words)

Ich musste den Jungen dauernd ermahnen: "leg dich nach vorne, leg dich nicht zu weit nach rechts", da wir sonst rückwärts die Treppe, oder seitwärts den Schacht hinabgestürzt wären, da alle Stufen nach rechts geneigt und die Treppe ohne Geländer war. Ab und an liessen die Fenster schon einen Ausblick frei auf die Stadt und ich konzentrierte mich immer mehr auf den Gedanken, dass ich jetzt auf keinen Fall schwindlig werden durfte, da ich die Verantwortung für den Jungen trug.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0096 (1949-07-22 - Göttingen)Heute Nacht träumte ich wieder, wie ich einem Hunde die Kiefer auseinanderhalten musste. Die Zähne bohrten sich immer tiefer in meine Hände ein und ich erwog, den Hund in einem grossen Schwung über den Zaun zu schleudern, um ihn loszuwerden. Aber ich wagte es nicht, weil er mich dann nur umso heftiger angesprungen hätte. 

Gegen Morgen träumte ich von einer grossen Tanzszene vor dem Nymphenburger Schloss. Alle Figuren spiegelten sich im Wasser und die Hauptfigur auf einer Insel hatte etwas von der Zentralstellung, die barocke Gartenfiguren in der Landschaft inne haben. Sie war bis an die Lenden geschürzt. Die Arme waren eingestemmt und der Körper hatte einen leisen Schwung in der Beugung nach aussen bei gebauschten Gewande. (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0101 (1949-07-28 - Göttingen)Ich war als Hospitant in einer grossen Nervenklinik und hörte bei der Visite die Ausführungen des leitenden Arztes über einen Mann, der infolge einer Gehirnerfrierung merkwürdige Verbrechen, wie zum Beispiel Überfälle auf die Dampfer einer Flussschiffahrtsgesellschaft verübte. Es war ein bekannterer Fall, über den schon diskutiert und geschrieben worden war. Deswegen wurden die Ausführungen sehr breit. Die genauen geographischen Umstände wurden festgehalten, zum Beispiel die genauere Lage eines Wäldchens etc. - Ich griff einmal zum Notizblock des Arztes, der mir dicht gegenüber sass, um genauere Angaben nachzusehen. Als ich merkte, dass der Arzt seinen Notizblock brauchte, schob ich ihn langsam zurück. Ich beobachtete ihn genau und dachte darüber nach, welches Gefühl seine Berühmtheit in dieser Situation erzeugen musste. Er war ein sehr junger Mann und trug seine Dinge mit einer gewissen Entäusserung, einer gewissen Scheu und Zurückhaltung, die die Bestimmtheit nicht ausschloss, vor. Während seines Vortrags verwandelte sich mir der Gegenstand seiner Rede in die Ereignisse während einer grossen Überseeschiffahrt, die ich nun erlebte. Wir fuhren unter den Klängen rhythmischer Musik in die Häfen exotischer Länder ein. (177 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0102 (1949-07-31 - Göttingen)Ich war mit Professor P. (Helmuth Plessner) zusammen in einem Ausspracheabend. Er wollte etwas vortragen, doch wurde er dauernd unterbrochen von einem aufdringlichen Studenten, der unbedingt seine Theorien an den Mann bringen musste. Ich sagte zu Christian v.Ferber, der neben mir sass: "Ist das nicht furchtbar". Er nickte mit dem Kopf und neben uns nickte Helmuth Plessner noch tiefer und tief resigniert. Als er zu Ende gesprochen, verliess er den Saal und verabschiedete sich noch schnell von dem Publikum, ehe eine Diskussionsleiterin abschliessende Worte sagen wollte. Wir beschlossen, nun auch zu gehen. (92 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0103 (1949-08-02 - Göttingen)Ausflicken eines Wandschirms dessen Schnüre durchschnitten sind, so dass die einzelnen Bespannungen aus dem Gestell fallen müssen. Dabei Gespräch mit Emmi, die um Hilfe gebeten wird. Erinnerungen, in denen Tessen-Werner eine Rolle spielt, durchziehen das Gespräch. - Dann Auseinandersetzung mit Vater. Dabei Situation wie in Schwerin in unserer Wohnung in der ersten Etage. Anschliessend Gang die Treppe hinunter zum Briefkasten, in dem sich die Schuhe finden, die der Schuster geschickt hat, und Gespräch mit der Botenfrau, die sich auf diese Weise Geld verdient. Endlich Empfang von Kaffeepulver beim Schweizer Hilfswerk und Streit mit der Frau, die die Rationen ausgibt und mir nicht die Portion in zwei kleine Tüten geben will, da ich keine zureichend grosse bei mir habe. Sie besteht darauf, dass ich noch einmal wieder komme. Ich klage über den Zeitverlust. (132 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0104 (1949-08-03 - Göttingen)Ich träumte mich als Reiter. Ich hatte eine Erbschaft zu übernehmen, mit der ich auch ein Amt antreten musste. Bei diesem hatte ich zwei grosse Lastzüge zu führen, die zuerst inspiziert wurden, und zuletzt bekam ich auch ein Pferd. Ich ritt sehr vorsichtig durch die Stadt und versuchte alle Komplikationen mit dem Autoverkehr zu vermeiden. Es gelang mir einigermassen, das Tier zu beherrschen. Auf dem Wege über den Theaterplatz hörte ich schon von Ferne Giselas und Christians Stimmen aus Giselas Zimmer. Ich wollte ihnen zurufen, um ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf mich zu lenken. In diesem Moment wurde das Tier scheu. Vor mir am Strassenrand war das Pflaster aufgerissen bei einer Bauarbeit. Ich versuchte, um die Stelle herum zu reiten. Doch konnte ich mein Pferd nicht mehr lenken, über das ich gerade erst das Vollgefühl der Herrschaft erlangt hatte. Es ging schliesslich rückwärts und drohte dabei, in das aufgerissene Loch zu stürzen. Ich zerrte am Zügel und das Pferd legte seinen Kopf zurück und biss mich in die Finger. Ich öffnete ihm vorsichtig mit der anderen Hand das Maul und während ich mich aus dem Biss befreien konnte, erwachte ich mit dem Bewusstsein, wieder von beissenden Tieren geträumt zu haben, und mit dem Gedanken an die triebhafte Grundlage dieser Traumbilder. Ich begann, sie aufzuzeichnen, und freute mich, als Datum schon den 3. dieses Monats einsetzen zu können. Es war mir sehr heiss und ich schlug die Decke weit zurück. Auch war ich verwundert, mitten in der Nacht so hellwach geworden zu sein, da mir sonst die Träume erst gegen Morgen bewusst werden. (260 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0105 (1949-08-04 - Göttingen)Ich suchte den Weg vom Flugplatz zu einem Vorort "Görries". Zunächst wurde ich durch einen langen, sandigen Anfahrtsweg an die Chaussee geschickt. Von dort rieten mir die Polizisten einen Abkürzungsweg, der fast in gleicher Richtung zurückführte. Als sie merkten, dass ich im Aufnehmen ihrer Wegbeschreibung unsicher wurde, fürchteten sie, ich könne mich im Walde verlaufen, da die Dämmerung schon hereinbrach. Da kam einem von ihnen der Einfall, ich könne den Fussweg gehen, der den Bahngeleisen folgt. Dazu musste ich über schmale, gitterlose Brücken balancieren und auch zunächst die Hilfe eines Beamten in Anspruch nehmen, der dort im Kahn auf dem Wasser fuhr, wo der Zugang zur ersten Brücke unterbrochen war. Ich fürchtete, von ihm abgewiesen zu werden, doch wurde ich dieser Sorge enthoben, da mich einer der Polizisten auf einem kleinen Umwege sicher an den Anfang des Pfades begleitete. Als ich allein auf dem Wege war, versuchte ich mich zu orientieren, und es fiel mir ein, dass mir Emmi als kleinem Kind zuweilen gesagt hätte: "Du gehst ja nach Görries", wenn ich anstatt des Nach-Hause-Weges die entgegengesetzte Richtung eingeschlagen hatte. Ich setzte noch im Erwachen diese Orientierungsversuche fort und versuchte durch ein Hinausprojizieren des Standpunktes meiner Göttinger Wohnung in die entgegengestzte Richtung der Stadt, die Lage dieses Vororts zu ermitteln. Dann erst fiel mir ein, dass Görries ein Vorort von Schwerin sei, bei dem der dortige Flugplatz gelegen war. Im Nachsinnen über die Lage der Göttinger Vororte schlief ich wieder ein und sah mich nun auf der Suche nach dem Weg nach Geismar. Schliesslich erreichte ich einen grösseren, ansehnlichen Ort, mit Marktplatz und Rathaus. Doch konnte ich niemand nach dem Namen fragen. Ich fand auf dem Platz einen regen, fast grosstädtischen Autoverkehr und als ich in eine schmalere Seitenstrasse einbog, sah ich eine sehr reizvolle Kinoreklame für einen Film mit dem Namen "Der blaue Traum", die mich heimlich befriedigte und fesselte. Dann befand ich mich auf der Suche nach einem Wahllokal. Ich musste in einem Behördenhaus viele Treppen hinauf- und hinabgehen und traf mich mit andern Verirrten und Suchenden. Schliesslich fand ich, der allgemeinen Richtung folgend, einen grossen, kellerartigen Raum, in dem an verschiedenen Wahltischen lange Schlangen standen. Da bei meinem Namensbuchstaben U niemand wartete, wurde ich sofort abgefertigt. Nachdem ich eine unbestimmte Weile in dem Raum geblieben war, streckte ich mich dort auf einem Bett hinter einem Wandschirm zum Schlafen aus. Doch wurde ich häufig gestört und schliesslich warfen Kinder, die mit mir spielend, einen seiner Flügel verstellen wollten, den ganzen Wandschirm um und ich erwachte. (417 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0106 (1949-08-05 - Göttingen)Ich traf einen Studenten beim Essen. Dann gingen wir um den Rasen herum. Später hörte ich ein Gespräch zwischen Student und Schuster. Jeder wollte dem andern klar machen, dass sein Beruf der schwerere sei. Als der Schuster gegangen war, versuchte ich dem Studenten klarzumachen, dass unser Beruf in der Tat leichter sei, weil wir ihn mit Freude betätigten - dagegen jener Schuster mit Unwillen. 

Ich träumte auch von der Lage eines Hauses im Strassenbild. Ich sah die Reihe der Häuser von hinten vom Stadtwall herabblickend. Während alle andern die Strasse säumten, war dieses Haus mitten in seinem Garten gelegen und es wurde ein Gespräch geführt, ob sich dieses Haus würde behaupten können, oder ob man jenen Garten als leer und raumverschwendend verschreien würde, weil man das Haus im Hintergrund nicht sah. Als ich erwachte, sah ich einen Wandschirm, an dem zwei leuchtend weisse Handtücher hingen. Als ich näher zusah, erkannte ich die bunten Fenstergardinen, von deren Fläche sich die hellen Felder der lichtdurchlässigen Rollos in scharfen Konturen abhoben. - Der Wandschirm ist etwas, hinter dem man Schutz suchen und sich verbergen kann. Mein Zimmer kann von der Strasse eingesehen werden. Ich überlege mir manchmal, ob ich hinter dem Wandschirm, der zum Fenster teilweise offen steht, beim Waschen genügend verborgen bin. (210 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0107 (1949-08-06 - Göttingen)Es war kurz vor Ostern. Zunächst ging ich mit Maria Reichhardt zum Bahnhof. Ihr Zug fuhr 9.15 Uhr. Dann waren wir Geschwister und unser Vater zusammen, der schon krank war. Er fiel dauernd hin und stiess sich dabei sehr. Schliesslich fuhren wir ihn in einem Rollstuhl. Mein Brunder stellte sich dabei sehr ungeschickt an und führte ihn dauern fast ins Gräben, zwischen engen Baumstämmen usw. - Schliesslich sassen wir alle beim Osterkaffee. Meine Schwester führte die Wirtschaft. In einem unbewachten Moment ging Vater allein heraus. Bald darauf kam Emmi und sagte, er sei im Ankleidezimmer wieder auf das Gesicht gefallen. Auf dem Flur stand eine Menge leerer Flaschen und Weingläster, deren Ordnung durcheinander gebracht war und die Spuren eines unsicher hindurch gegangenen Menschen zeigte. Vater tat sich merkwürdigerweise wenig bei den häufigen Fällen und so konnte ich ihm immer wieder aufhelfen. (141 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0108 (1949-08-07 - Göttingen)In meiner Wohnung sind zwei Einbrecher, von denen ich immer jeweils einen notdürftig bändigen kann, während der andere in der Wohnung verschwindet. Dieser Kampf zieht sich durch endlose Zeiten hin mit immer neuen Mitteln. Umschwenken des andern bis zu seiner Bewusstlosigkeit, Auf-ihn-Einschlagen wie auf eine halbtote Fliege usw. Schliesslich gelingt es mir, Margund zu verständigen, die ich als Schattenriss hinter der Glastür sehe. Sie soll das Überfallkommando anrufen. Ich rufe ihr noch die Treppe hinab meine genaue Hausnummer nach. Sie versteht 14 anstatt 40 und, indem ich noch einmal in aller Anstrengung das Wort vierzig hinausbringe, erwache ich über diesem Versuch und höre mich laut die Zahl vierzig sagen. Mein nächster Gedanke ist, ob Herr Stresau dieses laute Wort mitten in der Nacht gehört haben mag und wie er es deuten wird. (132 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0109 (1949-08-07 - Göttingen)Ich träumte ein langes Gesetz über Kastration und Sterilisation. Es war von dem, der diese Eingriffe verlangte, ein sorgfältig festgelegter Ritus gefordert, in dem er durch Handauflegung und unmissverständliche Bezeichnung sagen musste, was er von seinem Körper entfernt haben wollte. Ich las das Gesetz mit einer gewissen Abscheu gegen diesen handgreiflichen Ritus, bis ich begriff, dass in ihm die äusserste Sicherung gegen allen Missbrauch und alle Voreiligkeit geschaffen war. Es war ein "Nazigesetz" und ich erstaunte, dass man in Praxi so gegen sein eigenes Gesetz hatte verstossen können. (88 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0110 (1949-08-08 - Göttingen)Ich kaufe mir beim Bäcker einige Fünfpfennigstücke. Dann ging ich durch die Strassen und fand mich schliesslich vor dem Schaufenster der Töpferei. Ich schaute hinein und sah drinnen eine lustige Bilderfolge auf einigen Gegenständen. Ich musste darüber lachen und redete in meiner Freude leise vor mich hin. Plötzlich entdeckte ich Ikas Gesicht hinter der Fensterauslage, das mir lächelnd zuschaute, und begriff, dass man drinnen alle meine Worte gehört hatte. Ich machte eine drohende Gebärde mit dem Kuchen, als wenn ich ihn durchs Schaufenster werfen wollte. Dann öffnete ich ein wenig die Tür und schob eins der Stücke, das in der Form eines Löwen gebildet war, hinein, bis es in Ikas Mund landete. Wir wechselten einige Worte und sie wurde auf einmal sehr ernst. Dann ging ich weiter. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0111 (1949-08-08 - Göttingen)Ich war Braunschweig, um Margund zu besuchen. Um in die Wohnung in der 1. Etage zu kommen, musste ich durch ein Zimmer der Unterbewohner gehen, aus dem eine kleine Treppe in die Wohnung hinauf führte. Doch war die Treppe eingezogen und ich musste über Möbelstücke und die Fensterbank, mühsam mich von Stück zu Stück stemmend und immer neuen Halt suchend, hinaufklettern. Ehe ich mich an dem Fensterkreuz hinaufzog, prüfte ich sorgfältig, ob auch das Fenster fest geschlossen sei, so dass es mir wirklich Halt geben könne. Später frage ich Margund, ob der Eingang in ihre Wohnung immer mit solchen Schwierigkeiten verbunden sei, und erfuhr, dass noch eine zweite breite Treppe vorhanden sei, die in das Zimmer der Eltern führe. Jene kleine aber zögen die Unterbewohner immer zu den Zeiten ein, in denen das Theater keine Spielzeit habe, da dann keine Spätheimkehrenden dieser Treppe bedürften. (144 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0112 (1949-08-10 - Göttingen)Weihnachtskuchen in Hülle und Fülle. Mein Bruder und ich haben jeder seinen eigenen Vorrat, aus dem wir Geschenke machen, selber essen usw., doch sind die meinen weich und bröckelicht und zerbrechen bei der ersten Berührung, während die meines Bruders fest und sehr haltbar aussehen. - Ich will in ein Konzert des "Driesch-Quartetts" gehen. Doch ist mir die Zeit der Aufführung entfallen. Mein Bruder meint, es sei morgens um sieben und ich stehe auf in aller Frühe. Dann entdecke ich auf der Karte die aufgedruckte Anfangszeit 20.30 Uhr. Ich bin sehr enttäuscht, denn um diese Zeit kann ich doch am Weihnachtstag nicht hingehen, aber Emmi meint, ich könne es schon machen. Sie stört es, dass das Konzert in der Kirche aufgeführt wird - aber ich erwidere: Driesch ist doch einer unserer besten Geiger, und sie lässt sich überzeugen. - Im Wohnungsflur steht ein kleiner Junge. Er bittet um etwas, erhält es und wird dann hinterher frech. Ich will ihm eine runterhauen. Er läuft weg und zieht den Kopf ein. Durch sehr bestimmte Worte bringe ich ihn zum Stehen. Ich muss ihm einige Stufen entgegen gehen. Um ihn zu schlagen, muss ich erst die Arme festhalten. Dann versetze ich ihm eine Ohrfeige, danach eine zweite. Doch bei der zweiten wird es Emmi zuviel. Sie protestiert und läuft hinterher. (216 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0114 (1949-08-10 - Göttingen)Ich bin zu Besuch bei Christian. Er ist sehr überanstrengt und innerlich depremiert und sucht sich bei diesem Besuch zu erholen. Wir liegen auf dem Bett und schauen aus dem Fenster auf einen Marktplatz. Ich spreche darüber, dass es in Göttingen einige wirklich schöne Plätze gebe: so dieser Markt (Er hatte in dem Traum Ähnlichkeit mit dem Markt von Schwerin), der Theaterplatz und andere. Überdem schläft Christian ein. Ich höre, wie seine Wirtin kommt, um ihm etwas zu bringen. Ich will es ihm sagen und bemerke dabei erst, dass er eingeschlafen ist. Doch gelingt es mir nicht, ihn zu wecken. Erst als die Wirtin klopft, erhebt er sich völlig verschlafen. (110 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0116 (1949-08-12 - Göttingen)Besichtigung durch den General - jedoch in einer zivilen Situation. Wir führen unseren Garten vor. Margund und ich stehen vorne vor den Beeten, wo er an uns vorbeikommt. Die anderen sind hinten hinter höheren Pflanzen verborgen. Während er mit uns spricht, schaue ich ganz versunken in die Erbsen, die sich wie eine grosse grüne Mauer mit vielen weissen Blüten zwischen dem schwarzen Geäst des Erbsbusches aufbauen. - Als er vorbei ist, kommen die andern - es sind Jungens und Mädchen - hervor und Margund triumphiert, denn sie hat gerade gestern das Unkraut zwischen den Gartenkräutern gejätet, die man als ganz kleine Pflänzchen unten im Schatten der Erbsbüsche auf der schwarzen Erde stehen liess. Ich bin mir indess im Zweifel, ob der General auf solche Kleinigkeiten geachtet haben mag. (128 words)

Er monierte die Unterscheidung von "Stehen" des Körpers überhaupt (Positionalität) und seinem Stehen relativ auf einen bestimmten Ort. Ich erklärte es ihm aus dem Phänomensein des Körpers. Dann kam Adelheid und brachte das Essen. Vater hatte einen verdorbenen Magen und bekam einen zwar schönen, aber nicht kräftigen Brei. Er war damit sehr unzufrieden und zog ein Gesicht. (65 words)

Ich war damit nicht ordentlich genug, den Eltern vorgestellt zu werden. Dann hörte ich sie sprechen. Die Stimme des Vaters war hell und heiter wie bei einem jungen Menschen. Ich wurde schnell in die Küche versteckt und dann als ein fremder Mann vorgestellt. Doch wusste man sogleich Bescheid. Die Mutter war kräftig und riesengross, der Vater mit sehr langen Beinen und einem sehr feinen Gesicht. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0120 (1949-08-18 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte heute Nacht lange von einer Operation, die an mir ausgeführt werden sollte, ohne dass ich im einzelnen davon vorher erfuhr. Später war es eine ländliche Situation - ähnlich Roggow - wieder auf dem Hintergrund revolutionärer Stimmungen. Der Herr des Hauses lag krank und man erwartete seinen Tod. Es durfte keine Musik gespielt werden. Einmal, als wir durch sein Zimmer gingen, hiess es: "Er ist eingeschlafen". Ich wiederholte: "organisch eingeschlafen", um den Schlaf vom Tode zu unterscheiden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0122 (1949-08-21 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte gegen Morgen von einem Glase, in dem sich Phosphor befand, der dauernd in kleinen Funken in den Raum sprühte, während das Wasser im Glase kochte. Alle anderen Umstände habe ich vergessen, da ich im Nachsinnen über den Traum einschlief und neue Bilder hinzufügte. So erwachte ich mehrere Male und schlief wieder ein und veränderte dabei den Traum, bis er sich völlig verwischte. Nur weiss ich noch, dass die Bilder allmählich ins Kriegerische übergingen und schliesslich in einem Gang an der Zonengrenze zwischen russischer und englischer Besatzung endeten. (89 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0124 (1949-08-26 - Wittmoldt)Ich hatte Besuch von Emmi in Göttingen. Wir wollten zusammen eine Reise machen nach Hamburg. Wir sassen schon beide mit allem unserem Gepäck im Zuge und dieser setzte sich vor seiner Abfahrt zum Rangieren in Bewegung. Emmi sagte hocherfreut: "Jetzt geht es los". "Nein", sagte ich: "Der rangiert erst". Dann stand er vor der Bahnhofshalle und wir mussten nun aussteigen, um aussen rum in die selbe zurückzugehen, um dort von neuem einzusteigen. An der Sperre wurde ich nicht durchgelassen, weil meine Karte schon gelocht war. - Hier erwachte ich ein wenig und malte die Möglichkeiten dieser Situation in Gedanken aus. So mag es gekommen sein, dass Emmi schon im Zuge sass, als ich weiterträumte. - Sie rief mir zu: "Du musst seitwärts eine Treppe rauf gehen". Ich rannte die Treppe hinauf, dann eine andere wieder herunter, bis ich schliesslich auf dem Bahnsteig stand. Das letzte Ende des Zuges sah ich gerade noch aus der Halle rollen. Ich rannte mit äusserster Kraft hinterher, natürlich vergeblich. Dann sah ich am andern Ende des Bahnsteigs das Ende eines anderen Zuges, der sich sehr langsam bewegte. - Obwohl ich wissen musste, dass er in die falsche Richtung fuhr, nahm ich noch einmal alle Kraft zusammen und lief, bis ich den Zug eingeholt hatte, der inzwischen wieder angehalten hatte. Es standen ausländische Namen an den Wagen. Als ich den Schaffner erreicht hatte, sagte ich zu ihm: "Entschuldigen Sie, fährt dieser Zug nach Göttingen?" "Nein", sagte er, "diesen Triebwagen dürfen sie ausserdem auch nicht benutzen". - "Gibt es eine Möglichkeit, den D-Zug, der eben abgefahren ist, noch wieder einzuholen?" - "Nein". Ich stand nun hoffnungslos auf dem Bahnsteig, nachdem auch die letzten Illusionen zerbrochen waren, und erwachte. (281 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0125 (1949-08-25 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte, ich suchte auf einem langen Flur ein Zimmer wieder, in dem ich gewohnt hatte, konnte es jedoch nicht finden. Ich schloss eine Tür nach der andern auf, wobei sich der Schlüssel immer mehr verbog, und sah in jedem Zimmer eine andere Möbelanordnung als die gewohnte. Schliesslich kam ich auf die Idee, dass ich das ganze Haus in verkehrter Front durchsucht hätte und brauchte mich nur auf die gegenüberliegende Seite des Flurs zu wenden, um auf Anhieb die richtige Tür zu finden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0126 (1949-08-27 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte von Helmuth Plessner, dass er die Teilnehmer seines Kollegs photographierte in einem grossen Gruppenbild. Zur zweiten Aufnahme schob er mir die Kamera ganz dicht vor das Gesicht und ich versuchte, mit weit geöffneten Augen ins Objektiv zu schauen, dessen genauen Ort ich aber hinter einer grossen, braunen Blendplatte nicht entdecken konnte. Später sagten die Leute, er hätte das zweite Mal nur mich photographiert. Erst jetzt begriff ich das und bekam einen ganz heissen Kopf. Später hielt Plessner einen soziologischen Vortrag über den Wert des Photographierens, der von den jeweiligen Zeitgenossen schwerlich begriffen würde. Erst später würde den Mangel an guten Bilddokumenten empfunden. Sodann stellte er fest, dass er bei seiner ersten Aufnahme zu weit ab, bei der zweiten zu nahe heran gegangen sei. Er entwickelte die Bilder sofort nach der Aufnahme in einer kleinen gerümpelhaften Kammer. (138 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0127 (1949-08-27 - Wittmoldt)Ich ging nächtlich durch die Bahnhofssperre und sah das Häuschen, in dem der Kontrollbeamte sass, an seinem hellerleuchteten Fenster. Der Posten wurde vertretungsweise ausgefüllt von einem Studenten. Später hatte ich diesen Dienst zu machen und entdeckte nun erst, dass das Häuschen so ungünstig gelegen sei, dass der grösste Teil der Passanten unbemerkt daran vorbeigehen konnte, da es weit vom Wege ablag. Dafür wollten viele Leute bei mir Briefmarken kaufen, als einmal ein grosser Autobus vor der Tür hielt. Ich wies sie ab, doch gab ich der Schaffnerin, die als erste kam, aus Freundlichkeit. Sie entlohnte mich dafür reich mit mehr Groschenstücken, als nötig waren, die sich jedoch später als unecht herausstellten. Ich verliess mehrmals das Häuschen, da ich das Gefühl hatte, es könne vielleicht nicht das richtige sein. Doch stellte sich der Raum, dessen Fenster direkt an die Sperre grenzten, als ein Zigarrenladen raus. Er war gut geheizt und die Leute sagten mir, dass sie auch nachts hier blieben, da sie ja keinen anderen Platz hätten. Als ich in meine Zelle zurückkam, stellte ich fest, dass in ihr nur ein schwaches, rotes Licht brannte, bei dem man kaum lesen konnte. Auch war mir bei der Anweisung der Zelle durch den Schaffner am Anfang aufgefallen, dass sich das Licht nur einschalten liess, wenn die kleine Fallklappe zum Publikum geöffnet war. Es war ein Mechanismus ähnlich wie in einer Telephonzelle. Am Ende der Nacht bemerkte ich, dass ich keine einzige Karte gelocht hatte, doch legte sich meine Betrübnis darüber bei der Überlegung, dass es nicht nötig sei, den Polizei- und Kontrollwahn noch zu stützen, der in Deutschland so verbreitet sei.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0128 (1949-08-28 - Wittmoldt)Ich schrieb im Traum die Träume dieser Nacht auf. Dann schlief ich ein und fragte träumend einen Mann nach seinen Träumen und er erzählte mir die meinen als die seinen. Erwachend nun, erzählte ich einem andern von diesem Traum von meinen Träumen. - Als ich erwacht war, hatte ich nichts gesprochen noch geschrieben, wohl aber von dem Traum im Traum - geträumt. Es war der Traum von einer grossen Reise, auf der ich Heimweh hatte und unter fremden Decken schlafen musste. Und später setzte sich dann dieser Traum fort: Da schaute ich des Morgens aus dem Fenster, und noch vom Schlaf geblendet, sah ich Wogen über Wogen und sprach davon zu meinem Bruder, obwohl ich wusste, dass er eine andere Landschaft sehen musste. Dann klärte Berg um Berg sich aus den Meereswogen ab, bis sich eine vollkommene Gipfellandschaft sah, und ich beschloss, mit meinem Bruder die Heimreise nun anzutreten. (149 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0129 (1949-08-31 - Göttingen)Ich lag auf meinem Bett und las im Don Quichote. Die kleine Sigrid spielte um mich und schliesslich wurde sie müde und legte sich neben mich und spielte Auto. Sie machte dabei solchen Krach und tobte so, dass wir schliesslich beide halb aus dem Bett fielen. Auch Emmi war im Zimmer, die immer wieder auf den besseren Don Quichote hinwies, von dem dies nur eine schlechte Ausgabe sei. (68 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0130 (1949-09-01 - Göttingen)Ich wurde auf einer Waage gewogen, die zugleich die Arbeitszeit angab, die aus dem Verhältnis von Länge und Körpergewicht ermittelt wurde. Bei mir kam eine ganz minimale Arbeitszeit heraus. Die Waage stammte aus dem vorigen Jahrhundert. 

Dann handelte es sich um Umstellungen unseres Zimmers. Mein Bruder und ich hatten aus irgendeinem Grunde den Platz unserer Betten gewechselt. An einem Morgen hatten wir beide den Wunsch, unsere Betten wieder an unseren alten Platz zu stellen, da wir beide an den altgewohnten Plätzen besser schlafen konnten. Auch Emmi spielte hierbei eine Rolle und das Ganze hatte einen Anstrich von der Erinnerung an die Möbelumstellungen in unserer Kinderzeit, die Vater gerne vornahm und die für uns immer ein grosses Ereignis waren.

Sodann las ich in einem Brief meines Bruders, in dem er sich über die Auswirkungen seiner Verlobung aussprach. Er stellte Veränderungen fest, dass er des Abends fester und bestimmter einschliefe und des Morgens sicherer wieder erwachte. Zuletzt träumte ich von einem grossen Haufen von Schuhen, aus dem ich mir ein Paar ganz leichter Sandalen heraussuchen sollte. (174 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0131 (1949-09-01 - Göttingen)Im Einschlafen träumte ich etwas über das Verhältnis des Numinosen zum Körperlichen. Ein Kandidat vertrat in einer Vorlesung die Meinung, dass jenes an dieses gebunden sein könne. Ein älterer, angesehenerer Mann, unterbrach ihn in seinem Vortrag und stellte das Eintreten dieses Falles als so unwahrscheinlich hin, dass es lächerlich wirkte und der Vortrag durch schallendes Gelächter der Zuhörer quittiert wurde. Ich erwachte und wollte mich auf die Zusammenhänge besinnen, doch waren mir die näheren Verhältnisse sogleich entfallen, obwohl sie in dem Traum sehr deutlich gewesen waren. Es handelt sich natürlich um das Erlebnis des Numinosen und seine eventuelle Gebundenheit an körperliche - unter Umständen negative Veraussetzungen, wie etwa Krankheit etc. Giselas Krankheit mag bei diesem Gedanken eine Rolle gespielt haben, auch das Wissen, dass der Zustand völliger Erschöpfung neue Bereiche des Schauens erschliesst - weiter die Begschäftigung mit dem Leib-Seele-Problem und die allmähliche Erkenntnis, dass sich aus der Gebundenheit des seelischen Erlebens an das körperliche nicht alles erklären lässt. Das trat in der Skepsis des alten Mannes hervor. Die ganze Situation hatte die Gestalt eines Seminars oder einer Art Probevorlesung. Die Figur des älteren Mannes, wohl eines Professors, war sehr deutlich. Ein breiter Mann, der die Arme etwas in die Seite stämmte. Das Gelächter, mit dem der Kanditat missverstanden wurde, ärgerte mich. (212 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0132 (1949-09-03 - Göttingen)Ich träumte von Hans-Werner B., doch in der Gestalt eines Mädchens. Wir führten ein tief verstehendes Gespräch, das seine Akzente in feinen körperlichen Berührungen erhielt. (25 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0133 (1949-09-07 - Göttingen)Ich schlief heut Nacht bei Rudolf (Rudolf Jentzsch) und träumte von Wirtinnen in allen Schattierungen, da er abends nicht gewusst hatte, ob es seiner Wirtin recht sein würde. Dann träumte ich von einem Stapel von unendlich vielen Briefen, die ich ordnen und sichten musste. Das liegt daran, dass ich gestern den ganzen Tag damit beschäftigt war, alte Briefe und Aufzeichnungen zu sortieren. 

Als Drittes träumte ich von der Räumlichkeit, in der ich schlief, doch war sie in dem Traum komplizierter und liess den Blick zum Fenster nur durch andere vorgeschaltete Räumlichkeiten frei. In Wirklichkeit hat das Zimmer einen ganz kleinen, mansardenartigen Vorbau. (102 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0134 (1949-09-08 - Göttingen)Ich schrieb einen Brief an meine Schwester und steckte ihn in den Briefkasten. Auch waren einige lose Blätter mit Aufzeichnungen dabei. Diese lösten sich beim Einstecken aus dem Packen und lagen allein im Briefkasten. Ich griff durch den Schlitz hinein, um sie wieder herauszuholen, obwohl ich wusste, dass das verboten sei. Sie wären sonst verloren gegangen, da sie keine Adresse trugen. Ich schrieb nun nicht die Anschrift in den Bergen, sondern eine neue Anschrift irgendwo im Norden dazu. Dann setzte ich mich auf die S-Bahn, um selbst gen Norden zu fahren. Als ich in den Wagen ging, sah ich ganz vorne ein Mädchen im Pelzmantel sitzen, das mir zuzunicken schien. Ich dachte es sei Gardi und setzte mich neben sie. Doch da schien mir das Mädchen fremd und ich war im Zweifel und sagte unschlüssig guten Morgen. Aus der Art, wie sie den Gruss erwiderte, erkannte ich, dass es ein fremdes Mädchen sei. Ich konnte nach vorne durch das Fenster des Führerhauses aus dem Wagen gucken in eine sehr schöne Landschaft. Hier spielte eine andere Traumszene hinein, die mich an frühere Träume erinnerte, denn ich sah vor mir einen langen Weg, entlang einer Obstplantage, dann Gras, dann eine zweite mir bekannte. Rechts des Weges Wald. Es war dieser Weg die Verbindung von einem mir unbekannten Ort, den ich auf einem grossen Spaziergang erreicht hatte, zu einem wohlbekannten, von dem ich ausgegangen war. Doch schien mir diese Verbindung denkbar kurz nach so langer Wegzeit. Auch sprach ich mit einer Frau, die ihr Kind suchte, das sich vom selben Ausgangsort spielend verirrt hatte. Und eigentlich erst im Laufe des Gespräches begriffen wir, dass wir von diesem Ort so weit nicht entfert seien, und an der Lage der einzelnen Waldhügel zueinander rekonstruierten wir den Zusammenhang der Landschaft. - Ich fuhr nun mit einer S-Bahn in diese Landschaft hinein. Es war jene andere Szene, nicht zeitlich, sondern nur in der Erinnerung, in den Gang dieses S-Bahn-Traums eingeschaltet. Als ich vor mir in den Wald starrte, wurde vom Schaffner eine Warnung ausgesprochen, nicht so weit vorne zu sitzen, wegen der Gefahr, die diese Fahrt durch den Schwarzwald mit sich brächte, da das und das direkt auf einen zukäme. Das und das war ein Berg, Wald oder Ähnliches, von dem eine urtümliche Gefahr ausging. Doch ich blieb auf meinem Platze, da ich mir überlegte, dass ja dann der Mann im Führerhaus genauso gefärdet sei, wie wir, obwohl die Insassen des Wagens mir abrieten. Da wurde mir auf einmal klar, dass ich in falscher Richtung fuhr, denn der Schwarzwald lag ja im Süden. Ich verabschiedete mich von dem etwas zweifelhaften Mädchen im Pelz und ging eilig nach hinten, doch hatte ich meine Jacke vergessen und kehrte noch einmal um. Ein kleiner Mann in einem Rollstuhl strebte schon in grosser Eile meinem Platz zu und fuhr gerade mit seinen Rädern über meine Jacke, die am Boden lag. Nur mit Mühe konnte ich sie ergreifen und an der Station den Wagen verlassen. Ich war nun in Eutin, obwohl ich in Plön gedacht hatte, in einen Zug eingestiegen zu sein, der weiter nördlich fuhr. Auch spielte Vater hier eine Rolle, der auch in jener Traumszene von den Obstplantagen vorgekommen war, indem er dort Äpfel vom Boden aufgehoben hatte, obwohl es verboten war, was mir vor den Kindern peinlich war. - Die Lage der Bahnsteige im Eutiner Bahnhof war mir schon bekannt. Als ich den Wagen verliess, sagten die Leute, dadrüben steht sicher der andere Zug. Ich sah am Ende des Bahnsteigs einen andern in senkrechter Richtung dazu sich erstreckenden und dort verschiedene Züge und Wagen, darunter auch einen Triebwagen, der mir der richtige erschien. Auch sah ich, wie ein Bahnsteighäuschen sich bewegte, das in diesem modernen Bahnhof ebenfalls elektrisch gezogen wurde, mit den selben Antriebsmitteln wie die S-Bahn. Während ich mit meinem schweren Koffer dem Wagen in grosser Eile zustrebte, fiel mir ein, dass die Verbindung von hier nach Plön laut Vaters Erzählungen sehr umständlich und mit vielem Umsteigen und Warten verbunden sein müsse, obwohl mir das sehr merkwürdig schien, nachdem ich dieselbe Strecke in der anderen Richtung so schnell und mühelos zurückgelegt hatte. Ich dachte darüber nach, wie hoffnungslos schwer es ist, das Versäumte einzuholen, wenn man im Anfang die richtige Richtung verfehlt hat. Ich gab nun auf, das Fest noch zu erreichen. - Meine Koffer durch die Strassen tragend, begegnete mir die Frau von vorhin, die nun ihr Reiseziel erreicht hatte. Sie war in Begleitung einiger Herren, die ihre Koffer trugen, und ich grüsste sie von hinten an ihr vorbei kommend. Da ihre Begleiter gerade hier ihre Koffer absetzten, war ich zwischen ihnen und der Hauswand eingeklemmt und konnte die paar Schritte bis zu meiner Wohnung, die ich zum Einstecken der Briefe verlassen hatte, nicht zurücklegen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0135 (1949-09-08 - Göttingen)Ich beschaute mit Ika die Auslagen eines Kunstgewerbegeschäftes. Ich vertiefte mich in die Bilder Dürers und Albrecht Altdorfers. Sie hatte ihre Freude an einigen schönen Schalen und an vertrockneten Kuchen, die seit langem darin ausgestellt waren und bunte Farben angenommen hatten. Auch manch andere Bilder nahmen wir in uns auf, so eine Schar ganz kleiner Kinder, die auf winzigen Motorrädern uns entgegenkamen. Ich packte sie manchmal im Eifer des Gespräch am Arm und nannte sie aus Versehen Du. Anschliessend entschuldigte ich mich dann immer. 

In einer zweiten Traumszene begegnete ich nachts in dunkler Strasse einem dicken Herren, mit grossem, kreissägenförmigen Strohhut. Er trat einige Schritte zurück, erhob seinen Arm und ich sah in seiner Hand die Mündung eines Revolvers erscheinen. Ich warf mich zu Boden, um dem Schuss zu entgehen. Und während ich noch auf dem Rücken lag und zappelte, sagte er "Darf ich eine Aufnahme von Ihnen machen?" und starrte mich etwas fassungslos an über mein Gebahren. Ich wollte es kaum glauben, dass es nur eine Kamera sei, was er in der Hand hielt. (175 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0137 (1949-09-08 - Göttingen)Der Tag schloss sich aus Vormittag und Nachmittag wie eine grosse Acht zusammen, die völlig in sich selbst zurücklief, und beide, die sonst ins Endlose tendierten, hielten sich das Gleichgewicht. Diese Art, wie die Glieder des Traums in die Waage kommen, ist der Einschlag, mit dem das Erwachen in die Dynamik des Traums einspielt und sie bei einer endgültigen Form festhält. 

Erst später leuchtete mir wieder ein, was vormittags und nachmittags geschehen war. Und so konnte ich aus dem Schema dieses Traums seinen Inhalt wieder finden. Ich machte am Vormittag einen grossen Spaziergang mit Margund. Wir stiegen auf den Hügel von Nikolausberg und waren alleine in der alten Kirche. Wir lebten völlig zeit- und sorgenlos und liessen die Bilder der Landschaft auf uns wirken. Am Nachmittage aber war ich bei Gisela und manches Reifende war in Schwermut und Trauer gehüllt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0138 (1949-09-10 - Göttingen)Ich träumte von einem Seminar Nicolai Hartmanns. Eine Liste ging herum, in der man sich einzutragen hatte. Diese war in verschiedene Gruppen nach verschiedenen Arbeitsgebieten eingeteilt. Ich trug mich unter dem Namen Eduard Spranger ein. Als gemeinsamen Obertitel las ich "Seelsorge und Leben" oder ähnlich. Hartmann nannte manchmal meinen Namen. Er hielt mich für in Holstein auf dem Lande eingesessen. Einmal wollte er einen Satz von mir zu Ende gesprochen haben. Ich sagte, dass ich es nicht könne, da ich mich gerade mit der Liste beschäftigt hatte. (87 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0139 (1949-09-11 - Göttingen)Ich träumte heute Nacht von meiner Tante und einer Nähmaschinennadel. Denn hier besass ich eine sehr komplette und, da sie keine hatte, wollte ich meine leihen. Die Nadel war mit ausschraubbarer Spitze und überaus stark und sehr manierlich. Die Tante war verwundert und beschämt ob solcher Gabe. 

Fortsetzung am 12.9.1949 (139a): Ich wachte eben aus meinen Träumen auf mit dem geheimnisvollen Gefühl, mich selbst geweckt zu haben. Ich sprach das amerikanische Wort clay vor mich hin und fuhr mit einem gewissen Erschrecken aus dem Schlaf. Ich entsinne mich, dass in den Träumen meine frühere Wirtin eine Rolle spielte. Sie war von einer Reise zurückgekehrt und ihr Reisegepäck in unserem Zimmer abgestellt. Ich fand in ihrer Reisetasche einen Stapel von Briefen, die ich vor langer Zeit an sie geschrieben hatte, und wunderte mich, wie eine alte Frau so an mir hängen könne. (141 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0140 (1949-09-13 - Göttingen)Ich träumte von Christian, er sei doch noch aus dem Bergwerk zurückgekehrt. Ich traf ihn in der Post. Er legte den Kopf an meine Schulter und machte eine Gebärde des Sinnes: Du hast doch recht gehabt, und sagte: Die Arbeit war doch zu schwer. Er sprach von Novalis-abenden, die er dort mitgemacht hätte. 

Vorher träumte ich von Nicolai Hartmann. Wir sassen in einer Stube beieinander und führten lange Gespräche tiefen Einverständnisses. Zu unseren Themen gehörte das Problem, dass im Gemeinschaftsleben der Menschen das Wissen um die richtigen Kategorien zur zureichenden Einsicht in die Komplexheit seiner Zusammenhänge noch sehr mangelhaft sei, und dass infolge dessen die Kurzsichtigkeit allen Handels auf diesem Gebiet noch gross wäre.

Auch auf anderen Gebieten zeigte sich eine grosse Übereinstimmung der Ansichten. Zuletzt erzählte uns Hartmann ein Märchen. Da kam ein Kriegsheimkehrer hinzu, der ihn unterbrach und verbesserte, da er das Märchen besser kannte. Da klatschte Hartmann zur Anerkennung leise, und nur beinahe angedeutet, in die Hände. Übrigens ist es sehr interessant, woraus sich die Gestalt Hartmanns in dem Traum entwickelt hat. Es war ein Hauslehrer, den man auf einem Gut angenommen hatte, ein über 90-jähriger Mann, der wie ein Einsiedler gekleidet war, aber noch grosse Rüstigkeit zeigte. Später stellte ich fest, dass es ein jüngerer Mann war, der sich aus Tarnungsgründen verkleidet hatte. Während der langen Gespräche nahm er allmählich die Züge Hartmanns an. Zuletzt lief das Gespräch in eine Prüfungssituation aus. (236 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0141 (1949-09-13 - Göttingen)Ich fand im Traum mein Zimmer merkwürdig verändert. Möbelstücke standen in anderen Abständen und an anderen Stellen, als ich gewohnt war. Ich konnte mich nicht besinnen, sie umgestellt zu haben, tastete mit den Fingern nach, um zu sehen, ob ich mich nicht täusche. Schliesslich kam ich zu dem Schluss, dass ich im Traume sein müsste. Doch gelang es mir nicht, den Bann zu durchbrechen. Da merkte ich, wie ich eben ein Möbelstück an einer Stelle gesehen und sogar seine Schubladen geöffnet habe, an der zu stehen es ganz unmöglich Platz haben konnte. Ich war nun gewiss, im Traum zu sein und beschloss, ins helle Licht des Fensters zu sehen, um zu erwachen. Ich tat dies und erwachte sofort, obwohl in der Richtung, in die ich meine Augen aufgeschlagen hatte, gar kein Fenster war. Auch erstaunte ich sehr, dass ich mich in meinem Bett befand und meine Lage im Zimmer mit der Orientierung im Traum gar keine Ähnlichkeit hatte. Das äusserst Merkwürdige ist, dass ich in diesem Traum ein ganz klares Bewusstsein hatte, zu träumen, und diese Tatsache sogar logisch aus der Ungereimtheit der Raumverhältnisse und der Raumausfüllung durch die Gegenstände erschloss. Ich bemerkte direkt, dass mir meine Kommode nur in der Form eines Bildes erschienen war, weil an der Stelle, an der ich sie gesehen und sogar ihre Schubladen handelnd geöffnet hatte, in Wirklichkeit gar nicht genug Raum war; ich tastete auch mit den Händen sorgfältig die leergebliebene Stelle ab, an der sie eigentlich stehen musste, und doch konnte ich den Bann des Traumes nicht durchbrechen, ehe ich nicht von dem Ins-Licht-Schauen geträumt hatte, das zum Erwachen führt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0142 (1949-09-13 - Göttingen)Heute zwischen Wachen und Träumen fiel mir ein, dass ein Weg in meinen Träumen eine grosse Rolle spielt, den ich 1946 in Eutin ging, wenngleich er noch nie bis in jenes Bewusstsein hineingelangt ist, in dem man die Träume aufschreiben kann. Es ist der Weg um den Kellersee. Dort gibt es in dem Städtchen Malente ein Wegstückchen, das einen vom Ufer abführt. Ich versuchte, an den See zurückzukommen, und verirrte mich in Strassen und Gartenwege, aus denen ich erst allmählich wieder herausfand. Überhaupt hat jener Gang einen tiefen Eindruck auf mich gemacht. So dass klassizistische Haus, das dort inmitten hoher Wälder in bewunderungswürdiger Heiterkeit am Ufer liegt. Ein kleines Tempelchen liegt am Gartenrand schon halb im Wasser. Dort blieb ich eine Weile und schaute wechselnd auf den See hinaus und auf das Haus zurück. Dann verliess ich den Park und kam bald zwischen Herden hindurch in das Dorf und zum Uhleier Fährhaus. (152 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0143 (1949-09-14 - Göttingen)"Wo Ruinen fehlen, da ist Museum", so sprach in meinem Traum ein alter, beleibter Herr, der auf seinem Sonntagsspaziergang vor dem Haus stehen geblieben war und in die Fenster schaute. Er trug noch einen feierlichen, schwarzen Rock mit glänzender Weste und eine schwarze Fliege. An die Beine hatte er schon die bequemeren grauen Hosen gezogen. Er sprach die sinnierenden Worte zu seiner Frau und liess das Gespräch dann ins Biologische übergehen, doch immer noch im belehrenden Ton. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0146 (1949-10-02 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte heute nacht in vielen Bildern, die alle darauf hinausliefen, dass Leuten, die in Bedrängnis waren, finanziell geholfen werden sollte und dass ich das nicht für mich in Anspruch zu nehmen wagte. Zuerst ging ich, mir einen Hut zu kaufen. Doch alle hatten nicht die richtige Form. Dann wollte ich meine goldene Uhr in Ordnung bringen lassen. Doch der Uhrmacher wollte sie sogleich reinigen und einen hohen Preis dafür nehmen (9 Mark). Ich weigerte mich, da ich kein Geld hätte. Da kam eine Frau angelaufen mit einem Zettel, den ich ausfüllen solle. Es könne an Menschen in grosser finanzieller Not, die sich nicht mehr zu helfen wüssten, eine Summe von 10 DM vom Roten Kreuz ausgezahlt werden. Ich musste es ablehnen, denn ohne goldene Uhr kann man leben. Aber ich erhielt solche Zettel, um eventuell anderen helfen zu können. Sofort danach kam eine Frau in Bedrängnis. Sie hatte eine Tür zugeschlagen und kam nun aus dem Raum, in dem sie eingesperrt war, nicht mehr heraus. Ich musste ihr von aussen öffnen. Dann ging ich durch die Strassen und überlegte, wie man, bei kriegerischer Gefahr in die Häuser kommen würde, auch wenn die Eingangstüren an den Vorderfronten versperrt seien. Es war in Schwerin in der Werderstrasse vor Muddings Haus (jene Strasse, in der ich mich als Kind oft mit dem Gedanken beschäftigte, wie es wäre, wenn ein böser Geist hier nur Kulissen anstatt Häusern vor mir aufgebaut hätte). Es wurden nun viele Auswege von einem Passanten vorgeschlagen. Ein schmaler Gang, der auf die Höfe führte, über die Dächer laufen etc. Zuletzt war ich auf einem hohen Berg auf der Terrasse eines Ausflugslokals. Dort hatte ein geschäftstüchtiger Mann eine Radfahrerausleihe eingerichtet und gab durch einen Lautsprecher den Leuten Anweisungen zum Radfahren lernen. - Auch hatte er einen Erfrischungsraum sehr modern eingerichtet. Ich sah die Kuchen im Fenster doch konnte sie mir nicht kaufen. Sie waren zu teuer. Am nächsten Tag ging ich in das Lokal, um die Aussicht zu geniessen. Doch es regnete. Man konnte keine Berge sehen. Ich fragte den Ober "Haben Sie etwas zu essen?" - "Ja, eine Tasse Kaffee können Sie haben oder Gerundetes" - "Was ist das? den Namen kenne ich nicht" - er zeigte mir eine bregenartige Masse (Wir assen gestern Bregen). "Preis?" - "9 Mark". Alle anderen Preise waren ähnlich. "Nein, das kann ich nicht, ich habe kein Geld". Ich wollte aufstehen. Aber der Ober sagte "Ja, wenn Sie eben kein Geld haben, dann müssen wir es ihnen umsonst geben. Wir müssen eben keine Rechnung ausstellen". Ich wollte etwas dagegen sagen, aber er erwiderte, sie täten das schon, wenn auch hier ja eigentlich nicht der richtige Ort für einen wäre, wenn man kein Geld hätte. Aber ich konnte es nicht annehmen, denn nebenan war ja das Jugendberghaus, in dem meine Schwester wohnte, bei der ich bequem hätte essen können. (474 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0147 (1949-10-12 - Wittmoldt)Gespräch mit Dieter (Dieter Kruse) über meine hiesige Arbeit. - Er sagt, man habe es moniert, ich habe meine Arbeit auf den Terrassen (so statt Vorplätzen) des Hauses unterbrochen. Ich erwidere, da mir das sehr peinlich ist, solchen Vorwurf zu hören, ich sei zwar ein langsamer Arbeiter, aber ich habe stetig gearbeitet. 

2. Traumszene: Ich esse mit einer Person, die auch Züge von Vater trägt, Früchtepudding (Die Früchte haben Ähnlichkeit mit Fliederbeeren oder Rosinen). Am Boden der Schüssel ist der Pudding angebrannt. Ich denke, mein Vater wolle nicht zum zweiten Mal essen - wegen des Angebrannten. Er will es aber doch und ich gebe ihm von meinem Teller wieder ab, obwohl mir das peinlich ist - aber ich habe viel weicheres, saftiges, noch nicht angebranntes auf meinem Teller, von dem ich ihm geben kann.

3. Traumszene: Ich bin in einem Krankenwagen (Selbstfahrer für Gehbehinderte). Während ich die Reste von meinem Teller aufesse, bekomme ich das Angebrannte in den Mund. Ich spucke es heimlich aus. Es fängt an zu regnen und, da mich mein Bruder gezwungen hat, mit dem Krankenwagen aus dem Schuppen auf den freien Platz (Es ist der Ziegenmarkt in Schwerin) zu fahren, werde ich nass. Aber ich bleibe in passiver Resistenz einfach sitzen. Mein Bruder ruft mir immer wieder zu, ich solle aufstehen. Schliesslich tue ich es und gehe auf ein Haus zu (Es ist die Drogerie Gerard) und dann weiter in die Richtung Amtstrasse (Dort war früher auch meine Schule - der Weg führte durch sie und Ziegenmarkt-Münzstrasse auch zu Mudding Schultz, von wo ich Hichi (Maria Reichardt) oft in der gefährlichen Russenzeit heimbrachte). Als ich mich umsehe, ist der Krankenwagen weg. Ich laufe verzweifelt hinterher und sehe ihn in einem Hauseingang in der Münzstrasse verschwinden. Dort hole ich den Dieb ein, als der Wagen gerade, von einem Auto gezogen, in einer Garagentür (oder ähnlichem) verschwunden ist. Ich sammle mich im Hingehen. Und sage sehr bestimmt: Geben Sie sofort meinen Wagen her. Der Mann sagt ganz unverholen, dass er den Wagen brauche als Kastenwagen. - Da sehe ich zwei Polizeibeamten auf dem Hof, kutschierend auf dem Bock eines Pferdewagens. Ich rufe sofort: Polizei, zu Hilfe, obwohl der eine Beamte einen Generalsstern trägt, so dass ich in Zweifel komme, ob es überhaupt Polizisten sind. Aber sie tragen beide ganz einfache Schulterstücke. Sie kommen freundlich zur Hilfe, doch als ich den Dieb neben mir überführen will, trägt er auf einmal auch Polizeiuniform. Ich sage: der hat sich nur maskiert, und will ihm den Chacho vom Kopf stossen (den er trägt, während die andern ja nur Mützen haben). Ich sage auch, er habe unter seinem Mantel nur Zivil an. - Doch er knöpft sofort den Mantel auf und zeigt eine alte, abgegriffene Polizeijacke. Ich sage "So, Sie haben sich geschickt maskiert" und erwache. (463 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0150 (1949-11-10 - Göttingen)In einem grossen Treppenhaus ein Bernhardinerhund. Ich habe, wie vor allen Hunden im Traum, Angst, von ihm gebissen zu werden, doch nicht so stark als sonst, denn es ist ja ein Bernhardinerhund und diese gelten doch als besonders treu. Zuletzt will ich aus der Haustür gehen und schiebe den Hund mit aller Gewalt am Kopf zurück, da er mir folgen will, ich aber weiss, dass er im Haus bleiben soll. 

Einmal knackt schon die Tür im Schloss, während ich sehe, dass er immer noch seine Pfote hinausstreckt, ich muss also die Tür wieder öffnen und der Vorgang des Zurückdrängens setzte sich noch lange fort, bis seine Herrin kam und den Hund zurückhielt. (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0151 (1949-11-13 - Göttingen)Sehr interessante Träume von Nicolai Hartmann und Ernst Jünger. Ihn besuchte ich in seinem Haus in einer kleinen, winkligen Stadt. Er war gross und dick, ganz anders, als ich ihn mir vorgestellt hatte. Zwei Hunde hatte er. Einer sah sehr fürstlich aus wie eine Spanierin mit in der Mitte gescheitelten Haaren und von langsamer Bewegung. Der andere hatte ein schmales Gesicht und einen Hahnenkamm und wirkte doch damit sehr effeminiert. Bei Hartmann war ein Seminar, in dem seine Bücher gelesen wurden. Neben mir sass ein Ausländer, der den selben Text auf Englisch geschrieben hatte und schlecht übersetzen konnte, denn es handelte sich um eine Stelle, die in volkstümlichem Deutsch und mit Apostrophierungen geschrieben war. 

Später ein Fest in einer grossen, gotischen Kirche. Die Menschen wurden bald betrunken und benahmen sich sehr komisch. Hartmann besass auch einen Automaten, aus dem man Schokolade holen konnte. Ein Mädchen schloss sich mit mir in eine kleine Kammer ein. Sie hatte etwas Leuchtendes in ihrem Gesicht wie Feeli und etwas Packendes in ihren Bewegungen wie Gisela. Das lag daran, dass sie mit mir allein sein wollte, den ein Betrunkener verfolgte uns und wollte uns einen grossen Teller mit Sauce über den Anzug giessen. Der Schokoladenautomat war übrigens bald leer und dann erschien eine leuchtende Aufschrift auf seinem Schild mit dem Wort "Steril". Ich hatte zuletzt drei Tafeln auf einmal mit einem Groschen bekommen, doch hatte ein schlechtes Gewissen und warf die beiden anderen Groschen noch nach. Nicolai Hartmann hatte auch einen Autobus, um uns alle zu fahren, in dem er selbst am Steuer sass. Später sah ich Autobusse und Strassenbahnen und Lastwagen, die sich ganz dicht auf der verkehrsreichen Strasse begegneten, ohne sich zu schrammen. (280 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0152 (1949-11-14 - Göttingen)Träume aus dem Irrenhaus. Ich werde dort zur Beobachtung eingeliefert. Frau v.Bülow kühlt mir die Stirn, um das Schlimmste zu verhüten. Sie befürchtet bei mir wohl die gleiche Krankheit wie bei Vater (Ateriosklerose). Ich sage ihr, dass ich dazu noch zu jung sei. Dann Aufenthalt in der Anstalt. Der Anstaltsleiter schläft in einem Lederstuhl (Es ist der kleine Sessel, der zu Hause bei uns neben dem Radio steht, in dem Vater immer Mittagsschlaf hielt). Die andern halten Mittagsschlaf auf dem Fussboden. Einer sieht im Halbwachen mich dort stehen und macht mir Platz auf seiner Decke. Ich lege mich neben ihn und denke: Dies wird also jetzt dein Kamerad sein, denn er hat sich als erster um dich bekümmert. Allmählich geht die Handlung des Traums in eine Geschichte über eine solche Untersuchung über, die ich in einem Kinderbuch lese und später gleichzeitig als Film sehe und teilweise in der Rolle des Helden der Geschichte, eines kleinen Jungen, selbst erlebe. - Zunächst lese ich, obwohl es im Zimmer schon so dunkel ist, dass man fast nichts mehr sehen kann (Ich sitze vor der Balkontür in Muttis Zimmer in Schwerin) und probiere nun die Experimente, die man zur Untersuchung des Jungen anstellt, an mir selbst aus. Zunächst muss er die Augen schliessen und eine Ärztin nähert sich ihm mit den Händen und fragt ihn, ob seine Hände warm seien. Dabei hat sie aber eine Zigarette in der Hand und brennt ihn damit an den Händen, so dass er natürlich sagt: Warm. Ich schreie dazwischen und sage: So könne man das Experiment nicht machen. Später las ich ein Ereignis, wo direkt vor den Augen des Jungen ein Schiff auseinanderbirst. Danach sah ich dasselbe Bild in einem Bilderheft zur Illustration der Geschichte. - Im Laufe des Traumes sage ich auch einmal zu einem Kapitän, der viele Querfalten auf der Stirne hat, dass dies ein Zeichen der Hysterie sei. Er sagt: "Haben Sie etwa keine Querfalten?" - "Doch freilich", sage ich. - Die Geschichte von dem Jungen ist eine Fortsetzungsgeschichte und endet jedesmal so, dass er irrtümlich doch wieder für wahnsinnig gehalten wird. Zuletzt soll ich Zentnersäcke auf ein Schiff vor der Balkontür laden und weigere mich, weil sie zu schwer sind. (366 words)

Ein Gebirge seitlich der Stadt macht das Überfliegen unmöglich. Die Landkarte täuscht, da in Wahrheit zwei Städte (Hannover und Burgdorf) in eine zusammengewachsen sind. Dann Traum vom Blindflug und vom Orientierungsflug über ein Gebirge. Zuletzt Erzählungen von einem Flieger über dem Bodensee, der seine Beine heraushängen liess, um sie ins Wasser zu tauchen und dabei hineinfiel. Gedanke: Er brauchte doch nicht zu ertrinken, er konnte ja schwimmen. Dann die Vorstellung, wie der Flieger über dem See Kurven machen muss, um nicht gegen die Berge zu fliegen. (103 words)

Zuletzt laufe ich wahnsinnig schnell die Treppenstufen herunter und schlage die Tür hinter mir zu, sodass der Fuchs drinnen eingesperrt bleibt. Dann um viele Strassenecken, damit er mich nicht wiederfindet. Dabei einmal Gedanke: Was wird nun mit dem Fuchs passieren. - Später ging es in Strassenträume über. Eine Strassenbahn fährt ab. Verschiedene Menschen sitzen darin, von denen ich einige kennen sollte und nicht wiedererkannt habe. (126 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0155 (1949-11-17 - Göttingen)Träumte von vielen Strassen, in denen ich mich nicht zurechtfinden konnte. Dann sah ich einen Menschenauflauf. Ein Mann röchelte wie ein Erstochener. Dann hörte man ein Kind wie ein Neugeborenes schreien und sah eine Frau in Ohnmacht fallen. Andere Menschen eilten zur Hilfe. Ich suchte meinen Weg durch eine Seitengasse. Ich hatte einen Stapel Zeitungen, die ich zu einem Verwandten tragen musste, für den ich auch eine Weinkiste geschickt bekommen hatte. Ich ging zu Gisela und fragte sie, ob sie mein verlorenes Geld gefunden hatte. Sie hatte die Hälfte gefunden und schenkte mir die andere. Ich war sehr beglückt. Später lag ich zuhause im Bett und bemühte mich, mich auf meine Träume zu besinnen und sie aufzuschreiben. Ich reckte mich aus, um die Kerze auf dem Nachttisch anzuzünden. Doch stand statt ihrer eine Weinflasche da, an deren Hals ich mit dem brennenden Streichholz entlangglitt, bis ich merkte, dass hinter ihr der Leuchter stand, in welchem nun eine rote Kerze steckte, die ich anzündete mit dem Gedanken, mein Bruder müsse sie hineingesteckt haben. Dann sah ich die grosse Standuhr (die auf dem Flur steht) vor meinem Bett stehen und bemühte mich, die Zeit abzulesen. Es war schon zwanzig Minuten nach Acht. Später war sie fort und ich erkannte das Bild als ein Traumbild. Mein Bruder sagte, er habe sie auch gesehen und ich fragte ihn, ob er sie von seinem Bett in einem schrägen Winkel gesehen habe, da ich sie ja aus dem meinen frontal sah. Er bestätigte es und ich sah damit ihre Realität bewiesen. Ich tastete mit geschlossenen Augen die Stelle ab und fühlte sofort einen Gegenstand. Aber es war nicht die Uhr sondern eine Weinkiste. Hiernach brauchte ich noch lange bis zum vollen Erwachen. (286 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0156 (1949-12-03 - Göttingen)Träumte heute nacht von lauter Doppelgängern und dann, wie ich Gisela und Margund davon erzählte. Zuerst waren es zwei Doppelgänger meines Bruders, die in meine Stube kamen und meinen Schrank ausplündern wollten. Nach einer Zeit gelang es mir, sie zu bändigen. Ich würgte sie und warf sie auf die rote Decke meines Bettes. Dann zwang ich sie beide nacheinander, mir ihr Profil zu zeigen, damit ich den Doppelgänger von meinem echten Bruder unterscheiden könne. Doch beide hatten eine Hakennase und waren also beide unecht. Später kam mein Bruder selbst. - Bald darauf kam eine Frau, die sich als Frau v.Uslar vorstellte. Ich erkannte bald, dass sie nicht echt war, doch sagte nichts, da ich sie gerne mochte und im Laufe der Zeit sogar mit dem Gedanken spielte, sie zu heiraten. Zuletzt kam ein Doppelgänger meines Onkels Gerd aus Hamburg. Wir standen auf dem Flur und, als ich entsetzt ausrief, es sei ein Dieb oder ein Betrüger, nahm ein kleiner Junge, der dort stand, einen Revolver und schoss ihn tot, ohne dass ich diese voreilige Handlung verhindern konnte. 

Gisela träumte heute nacht von einem Pferd, mit dem sie über die Dächer der Stadt reiten konnte.

4.12.1949. Am Vormittag, nachdem ich dieses schrieb, erfuhr ich, dass mein Onkel Gerd am 1.12. sich durch Gift das Leben nahm. Ich wusste, dass er sich mit diesem Gedanken trug, hatte jedoch wochenlang nicht mehr daran gedacht. Ich erfuhr es durch Onkel Adolf, der am Vormittag des 3.12. hierher reiste und es uns beiden bei der Gelegenheit mitteilte. - Das Traumbild von dem Revolver mag aus einer Erzählung Onkel Gerds stammen, als ich ihn das letzte Mal im August besuchte. Es handelte sich um ein Mädchen, dass sich vor langem mit einem Revolver erschossen hatte. (289 words)

Wir winkten zunächst vergeblich. Dann an einer Ecke, die der Greenhouse-Partie in Schwerin glich. Ein kleines, offenes Sportauto. Ein Herr in altmodischer Kleidung sagte: "Jedem erzähle ich, dass dem Wagen Nummer 9 verboten ist, Menschen mitzunehmen". Dann liess er uns einsteigen. Alle hatten Platz bis auf mich. Gisela war in ein Gespräch vertieft und achtete nicht auf mich. Ich rief empört ihren Namen und schlug ihr mit einem Buch auf den Arm. Sie drehte sich langsam und sehr bestimmt um und sagte: Was fällt Dir eigentlich ein. Ich erwägte im Erwachen, ob ich auf den Hacken Kehrt machen sollte oder nicht. (151 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0162 (1949-12-27 - Wittmoldt)Ich ging mit dem Komponisten W. Kienzel -, mit dem ich vorher schon eine Opernprobe mitgemacht, bei der zuletzt vor Anstrengung fast alle in Ohnmacht fielen,- über den Vorplatz des Gutshauses in Roggow, während sehr langsam ein viermotoriger Bomber ganz niedrig über uns hinflog, in dem die Besatzung wie in einem Jagdflugzeug so frei sass, dass man jeden einzelnen sehen konnte. Besonders prägten sich mir die Züge eines sehr gut aussehenden englischen Leutnants mit schwarzen gewellten Haaren ein. Vor dem Hause stand ein englischer Tank und später kam ein grünes Postauto. Als wir in dieses einstiegen und schon ein Stück gefahren waren, sahen wir, wie das Flugzeug immer niedriger ging, um eine Notlandung zu versuchen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0165 (1950-02-07 - Göttingen)Mittags. Ich lag im Halbschlaf, dauernd wie an der Oberfläche des Schlafes hingeschleppt. Immer wieder wachte ich durch einen neuen Schrecken auf. Einmal war ich mit dem Schädel gegen einen Laternenpfahl gerannt, dass es einen dumpfen, dröhnenden Klang gab, bei dem ich mir des ganzen Unheils bewusst wurde, mit jener erschlaffenden Gleichgültigkeit des Entsetztens, die das Geschehene nicht mehr rückgängig machen kann und doch zu einer richtigen Stellungnahme noch nicht fähig ist. Einmal hörte ich es drei Mal klingeln, während ich gerade beim Umziehen war, und schickte Gisela schnell zum Aufmachen hinaus. Einmal hörte ich die Stimmen meines Bruders und seines Freundes hereinkommen und konnte weder mich vom Bett erheben, noch die Augen öffnen. - Manchmal sann ich langen, bei wachem Betrachten völlig sinnlosen Sätzen nach, die alle im Stile Schleiermachers gebildetet waren. (Ich hatte wenig geschlafen, heute Morgen starken Tee getrunken und dann mehrere Stunden im Schleiermacher gearbeitet). (149 words)

Ich drücke mich etwas befangen, aber Unbefangenheit spielend, aus der Tür. Denn ich war aus der - allerdings offenen - Arestzelle ausgekniffen, in der jeder zu Beginn eine Zeit lang zur Probe bleiben musste, weil ich damals einsah, dass hier nie der Ort meines Bleibens sein würde. Auch wurden Vollstreckungen an andern Delinquenten von einem verlangt, die undurchführbar waren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0177 (1950-02-17 - Göttingen)Im Bergwerk. Der Schacht ist durch irgendeine Katastrophe versoffen. Ich stehe auf einem wackligen Brett und versenke an einem grossen Strick ein Bündel Papier ins Wasser, bis es tief unter den Gewässern die Region des Feuers erreicht, um es dann hochzuziehen und damit die Stichflamme an die Oberfläche zu locken. Es ist ein Spiel mit dem Feuer, doch die Reinigung des Schachtes gelingt. Die Flamme schlägt durch, ohne mich zu verzehren. Es ist sehr reizvoll, die blauen Flämmchen auf der Fläche des Wassers erscheinen zu sehen. - Später im Aufenthaltsraum der Bergleute. Urtümliche, fast hölzerne, bärtige Gesichter. Zum Teil mit schielenden Augen. Ein Konglomerat aller Ausgestossenen der Welt. Dort herrscht eine merkwürdige Grusssitte. Die Kumpels reichen sich die Hand und schlagen sich dann selbst mit der eigenen Hand eine Ohrfeige. Ein Angehöriger einer südlichen Bevölkerungsgruppe kommt herein mit diesem Gruss und bekreuzigt sich dann feierlich. Nächste Szene: Ein Bad in den Gewässern, die aus dem Schacht ausgetreten sind. Zunächst beschäftige ich mich wieder mit dem Versenken eines Stricks in der Tiefe. Diesmal hängt ein Eimer daran. Doch die Badenden verschieben die Bretter, gefährden meinen Standpunkt und machen das Unternehmen unmöglich. - Zuletzt eine Diskussion in bergmännischen Kreisen. Daran beteiligt ein Junge mit Samtbarret. Später derselbe mit seinem jüngeren Bruder am Klavier. Beide sehen reizend aus. Sehr selbstbewusst mit ihren Samtkappen im holsteinischen Stil. Darunter volles, kräftiges Haar, zurückgekemmt und dabei etwas hochgebauscht (ähnlich wie auf dem Bild von Margunds Bruder). Sie spielen ein barockes, sehr heiteres Stück, das in jedem Part mit drei hellen, glockenartigen Tönen beginnt. Doch können sie sich nicht ganz einigen. Der Kleinere ist etwas lebhafter und impulsiver, der Grosse verhaltener und bedächtiger. Später sehe ich mich mit meinem Bruder im Kinderzimmer in Schwerin. Ich werde von den Erinnerungen überwältigt und muss weinen. Doch als ich erwache, schäme ich mich des Weinens. (305 words)

Den Schupo an der Kreuzung sehe ich gerade noch in einer Verkehrspause im Polizeiauto abfahren. Er hat nichts mehr zu tun. Schlendernd gerate ich in eine Nebenstrasse. Dort sitzt in einem Fenster ein nacktes Mädchen, jung und etwas braungebrannt. Sie sagt, sie sei erhängt worden und dann dort in die Fensternische gesetzt. Sie ist aber lebendig. Ich lege den Arm um sie und ziehe sie zu mir hinab. So geht sie festgehalten neben mir her. Nur scheu und flüchtig berühre ich einmal ihre Brüste.

Gisela will dort hinauf, weil sie im indischen Stil gebaut ist. - Der Traum ging hervor aus einem anderen, in dem mich Krischan (Christian) auf einem Umweg in den schon geschlossenen Katalogsaal der Universitätsbibliothek führen will. Viele Stufen tastend hinab in einem völlig dunkeln Kellertreppenhaus, das ich nicht kenne und in dem ich ihm kaum zu folgen vermag. Dann wird die Tür ins Helle aufgestossen und wir stehen verwundert an ganz anderer Stelle im Schloss- oder Burghof. Hier Übergang in den Traum mit Gisela und den aufsteigenden Wendeltreppen. - Ein Arbeiter hat uns den Schlüssel gegeben. Die breiten Treppen vermeiden wir, um nicht vor die Absperrungskordeln der Museumsverwaltung zu geraten. - Vom Hofe aus sahen wir die Kuppel und auch zwei andere vergoldete Bekrönungen. Die eine, eine Art goldener Aussichtskuppel, in der man die Leute Karrusselfahren sieht. - Ein Gang durch den Burggarten sollte uns an das richtige Treppenhaus bringen. Einmal teilt sich der Weg in zwei Brücken. Die eine aus Stein, dammartig aufgeschichtet, die andere hölzern, etwas morsch. Ich wähle den Weg über die erste. Doch sie ist sehr schmal und glitschig und erst allmählich kann ich mich vergewissern, dass sie auch wirklich zum Ziel führt, hingegen sehe ich, dass die andere den einfacheren und kürzeren Weg bildet und auf einen breiten Kiesweg hinausführt. Ich rufe Gisela zu, dort zu gehen, und wir treffen uns am Ende der Brücke wieder und finden endlich in das richtige Treppenhaus. Nach dem Erwachen weiss ich nur noch aus der Art der Erinnerung, dass ich von Gisela geträumt haben muss. Gedanke dabei: Es ist wie auf der Jagd nach einem sehr edlen und seltenen Wild, das nur wenige Augenblicke in der Dämmerung aus dem Dickicht hervortritt und erst, nachdem es verschwunden ist, wird man sich dessen bewusst, dass man ihm gegenüber gestanden hat. Dann erst werden mir die einzelnen Züge des Traums allmählich deutlicher. (328 words)

Auf dem Flur hatten die Handwerker ungeschickt mit einer Kette das grosse Bild des Grossvaters heruntergerissen und in Stücke zerbrochen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0185 (1950-02-25 - Göttingen)Die Vögel singen. Es ist morgen. Ich war im Traum in russische Gefangenschaft geraten. Plötzlich auf dem Marsch wurde ich von einem älteren deutschen Offizier in Obhut genommen, zusammen mit einem anderen Kamaraden. Wir wurden in einer kleinen Zelle untergebracht, die breite Fenster zur Einfahrt eines grossen Schlosses öffnete. Dort sassen wir immer und schauten hinaus, hatten alle Freiheiten und waren gut gekleidet, doch wussten wir nicht, wer in dem Schloss wohnte oder hatten es vergessen. Eines abends sah ich ein wenig entfernt die Russen tanzen. Es waren junge Offiziere, die dort Tänze lernten. Ich sagte zu meinem deutschen Hüter, der gerade vorbeikam: "Dort würde ich gerne mittanzen. Solche Tänze würde ich gerne lernen". Er sagte: "Heute Abend hast Du Ausgang und kannst dort im grossen Haufen mittanzen". Ich schaute auf den Schlosshof und in dem Moment sah ich von der königlichen weiss-roten Fassade des Bauwerks eine Gruppe Menschen herankommen, in deren Mitte mir ein hoher deutscher Offizier auffiel. Zuerst entdeckte ich eine Spange mit den Schwingen eines Adlers an seiner Uniform, die ihn als hohen Offizier der Luftwaffe auszeichnete. Ich machte meinen Kumpanen darauf aufmerksam und unser Unteroffizier sagte: "Da kommt der Badener". Es war der Grossherzog von Baden, der hier gefangen lag. Als er das Tor durchschritt und alle ihm huldigten und grüssten, sah ich genau sein würdiges, vom Alter gezeichnetes Gesicht, das diese Huldigungen etwas verwundert und befremdet entgegennahm. Sein Rock war mit vielen Orden geschmückt, unter denen ich das Eiserne Kreuz und den Pour le mérite klar erkannte. Ich dachte: Es steht einem Fürsten auch in Gefangenschaft nicht an, seine Orden abzulegen. Er ist wahrhaft Fürst geblieben. Ich träumte im Erwachen noch viel von Russland, sah mich mit Gisela dort zusammentreffen, die ebenfalls gefangen war. Wir lebten in einem Russenhäuschen und hatten ein Kind. Dann machten wir grosse Reisen bis zu Stalin, und baten von ihm die Freiheit, heimzukehren, wann wir wollten. Wir waren in russischen Grosstädten und arbeiteten an russischen Filmen. Doch waren dies alles keine Bilder mehr, sondern nur noch Gedanken. (337 words)

Doch als wir Gisela begegneten, musste ich sie absetzen und stehenlassen. - Dieter kam zu Besuch und hatte gleich das Bedürfnis, in der Stube Ordnung zu schaffen. Verabredungen mit Gisela spielten in den Traum hinein. So mussten wir an ein Ufer gehen, um sie im Boot abzuholen. Doch waren die Verhältnisse sehr verwickelt und unübersichtlich. Ich erinnere nur noch, dass sie eine Strecke, die mit dem Boot zu durchqueren war, sehr kurz abschätzte und sich wunderte, als ich meinte, dass man, über sie zu rudern, länger brauchte. - (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0187 (1950-02-27 - Göttingen)In einer fremden Stadt auf der Suche nach dem Bahnhof. Ich gehe meinem Gefühl nach auf das Stadtzentrum zu, indem ich dem Gefälle der Strassen folge (Kiel). Merkwürdige Strassennamen, die mir von einem Passanten etymologisch erklärt werden. Sie ändern sich zuweilen, indem sie aus dem selben Stamm andere Bildungen hervortreiben oder mit anderen Namen kombiniert werden. - Dann begegnet mir eine lange Kolonne von Zünften, die in einem Vorbeimarsch Zeichen und Symbole ihrer Arbeit tragen, auch kurze Darstellungen des Arbeitsganges der Zunft. Ich habe die Aufgabe, mich an die Spitze des Zuges zu setzen, der jetzt in meiner Richtung geht. Es geht aus der Stadt hinaus. An der Spitze sind zwei weissbraune Pferde, die der Führung bedürfen, weil sie schon einmal ausgebrochen sind. Ich habe einen älteren, erfahrenen Begleiter, der von einem Wagen das eine Pferd kutschiert. Das andere habe ich Mühe zu halten. Schliesslich sind wir an einem grossen Gatter angelangt, über das die Pferde in ein Gehege zu bringen sind. Der ältere Mann - es ist ein Unteroffizier - setzt sich auf das eine Pferd und ein zweiter Begleiter auf das andere. Während der erste sofort mühelos über das Gatter kommt, bäumt sich das Pferd des anderen auf und sucht im Sprung die höchste Stelle des Gatters, dessen oberste Stange es mit dem Bauche streift, so dass es sekundenlang darauf schwebt. Dann bricht alles zusammen und Pferd und Reiter überschlagen sich. Ich sehe diesen Vorgang in Zeitloupe und während ich erkenne, wie der Reiter in einem gewaltigen Salto rückwärts sich dem schweren Fall des Pferdes entzieht, durchfährt mich der Gedanke, wie es möglich sei, diese Aufnahme in diesem dramatischen Moment in Zeitloupe zu bringen. Es begleitet mich dabei die Vorstellung einer Kamera, die oben auf dem Gatter angebracht ist und den Vorgang filmt, gleichzeitig damit, dass ich ihn sehe. - Es wäre - das bedrückt mich tief - meine Aufgabe gewesen, die oberste Stange des Gatters zu entfernen. Doch hatte ich es nicht für nötig gehalten, da das erste Pferd so glatt passiert war. Das gestürzte Pferd ist sogleich tot und nach einer Weile erkenne ich an einem grossen weissen Blatt, auf dem der Name des Reiters mit einem Kreuz eingetragen ist, dass auch er tot ist. Mit dem Bewusstsein einer entsetzlich drückenden Schuld erwache ich. In einem erneuten Einschlafen setzt sich das Motiv der Pferde fort in einem Traum mit Gisela, der umso beglückender ist. Sie hat eine Krankheit, die ihr die Beine lähmt, doch der Arzt, der die Gestalt Lehmanns (des Dirigenten Fritz Lehmann) hat, stellt fest, dass nur eine seelische Hemmung vorliegt. Er fährt ihr mit der Hand zwischen die Beine und elektrisiert sie dadurch so, dass sie völlig gelöst wird und in grosse Heiterkeit ausbricht. Mit diesem Gefühl der Heiterkeit und einer grossen Sicherheit wache ich auf. Man sollte diese Sicherheit des Traumes nicht verachten, auch wenn sie unseren Wünschen folgt. Sie ist eine Quelle grosser Kraft und reicht bis in metaphysische Tiefen hinab, dorthin, wo wir wirklich einen Zugang zu dem Sein des anderen haben. (502 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0191 (1950-03-08 - Wittmoldt)Politischer Traum. Sehr kühl und rational. Gespräch ohne sichtbare Personen. Zwischengestalten aus dem Mittelalter. Typen etwa wie Wilhelm II und Bismarck. Es geht um eine Kriegführung, zu der ein Länderbund dem Kaiser verpflichtet ist. Einige Länder fehlen in diesem Bund. Der Grund zu diesem Fehlen wird von einer Frauenstimme erzählt. Es ist die Stimme einer Frau, die zu diesem Bund gehört, der noch jetzt wie manches alte eine schattenhafte gesellschaftliche Existenz führt. Mehr theaterhaft. Die Geschichte geht auf finanzielle Streitigkeiten zwischen dem Kaiser und dem Wittelsbacher zurück. Dieser erhält ein freies Haus für Künstler. Man sieht eine sehr schöne, mit viel Glas errichtete Villa. Der Kaiser will Geld von ihm und, als der Bayer sagt, dass er jetzt keines hat, hört man den Kaiser sagen: es muss doch jeder (sc. von den Künstlern) etwas dazu geben können. Der Bayer antwortet erbost: "Macht euren Dreck allene". Er meinte nur: Ich will mit der Geldsache nichts zu tun haben. Der Kaiser legt es als Austritt aus dem Bund aus und entlässt ihn. - Das Fehlen anderer Länder ist in folgender Szene begründet. Einige aufsässige Städte werden von deren umliegenden Ländern belagert. Als nun das Heer des Kaisers kommt, um die Aufsässigen niederzuschlagen, findet es den Zugang zu den Städten von den belagernden Heeren versperrt. Der Kaiser fasst das irrtümlich als Gegnerschaft auf und das kaiserliche Heer legt nun einen zweiten Belagerungsring um die Belagerer. (232 words)

Ich kam in Gefahr, durch das Hantieren mit der Stange Autos und Strassenbahnen durcheinander zu bringen und selbst übergefahren zu werden. So sprang ich schliesslich immer schneller zwischen diesen Fahrzeugen hin und her, ohne dass mir die Annäherung and diese Tür gelang.

Zuletzt die Bilder über den Schweriner Dom. Ich trat, um sie mit der Wirklichkeit zu vergleichen, in das Portal des Domes ein. Drinnen Orgelmusik, eine Sängerin und einige Zuhörer. Die Probe zu einem abendlichen Konzert. Auch einen Sänger entdeckte ich später und N.G. (Professor Niedeggen-Gebhardt) als Regisseur. Ich setzte mich auf eine Bank. Die wackelte. Darum stand ich mit einer Entschuldigung, die ich zu meinem Nebenmann, Professor Wolf, sprach, auf, mit dem ich Rücken an Rücken sass. Später auf einem Stuhl neben Frau Strehlocke, die mir gut zuredete. Mein Blick wanderte und blieb an einem stilisierten Altarbild hängen, die Gesichter Ertrinkender, die kaum erkennbar in den Wellen gebildet waren. Ein Grauen erfasste mich: So also ist der Tod. Ich erwachte mit dem Gefühl grenzenloser Einsamkeit. Doch dachte ich daran, dass der Heiland mit unter den Ertrinkenden war. Dann fiel mein Blick auf das Bild von Gisela und es fiel mir ein, dass ich nie mehr allein bin. Auch wusste ich, dass Du nicht mehr von mir sagen kannst, Du könnest es nicht ertragen, dass ein Mensch wie ein Sklave von dir abhängig sei. (216 words)

Dazu hielt der Standesbeamte eine feierliche Rede, in der es hiess, dass die Dinge lange in schwierigen Debatten in der Schwebe bleiben könnten, bis ein Zeuge Gottes käme und die ganze Sache wie von selbst in die Reihe käme. Mir war die ganze Angelegenheit widrig, und ich kniff die Augen. Dann war ich erwacht und sass in Schwerin im Esszimmer, um den Traum aufzuschreiben. Mix sass mir gegenüber und erzählte laut Geschichten. So kam ich nicht zum Aufschreiben und hörte sie geduldig an. Doch als es mir zu bunt wurde, verbot ich ihr einfach den Mund, weil ich den Traum sonst vergessen hätte. Da gab es einen Tumult, in den sich Vater und Emmi einmischten. Ich konnte nun den Traum erst recht nicht mehr behalten und wurde noch lauter. In der Debatte hiess es, wenn ich an den Nervenarzt Dr. Köhler geschrieben hätte, dann müsse ich ja auch krank sein, und was denn eigentlich los sei. Man wollte mir mein Traumbuch entreissen, und ich wehrte mich. Ich konnte mich gar nicht mehr besinnen, geschrieben zu haben. Doch schliesslich sah ich einen Antwortbrief aus Paris an meinen Bruder und mich, des Inhalts, dass die Schreiber jetzt keine Zeit hätten, auf unsere Gedanken einzugehen. Dazu ein Couvert mit der Adresse: Dr. sowieso, Paris, chez Driesch. Ich erkannte daraus, dass er bei Driesch wohnte, und beneidete ihn um den schönen Aufenthalt in Paris. Dann wachte ich endgültig auf und ärgerte mich über den vergessenen Traum, bis mir seine Teile wieder einfielen. (279 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0204 (1950-03-31 - Wittmoldt)Träume von Feeli, Ika und Gisela. Der Inhalt ist mir leider entfallen. Mit Feeli handelte es sich um Kuchenessen. Ich war sehr gierig und nahm ihr sogar die Stücke, von denen sie selber ass, halb im Traumzustand aus der Hand. Ich war selber erstaunt über meine Gier. Ein Restaurant hatte den ganzen Dachgarten mit Mohnkuchenstücken gepflastert. Nun regnete es, und ich war sehr um das Schicksal des Kuchens besorgt. - Andere Träume gingen um einen Film, der völlig in seiner Handlung ausgesponnen war und den ich später sogar jemand erzählte. Ich weiss noch, dass, ich in dieser Erzählung vieles fortliess, um die Spannung nicht zu vermindern. Jetzt tut es mir leid, dass ich das tat. Ich hätte sonst den Gang der Handlung wohl besser behalten. Es waren Anklänge an den "Dritten Mann" und das Thema von "Arzt und Dämon". Ein Mann hatte die Möglichkeit, durch eine Zauberformel sich zu verwandeln in was er wollte. Er musste dazu auf einen dicken Strich steigen, und auf diesem stehend war er dann die gewünschte Person. In dem Film spielte eine Reise - ich glaube von Wien nach Paris - eine Rolle. (188 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0208 (1950-04-07 - Wittmoldt)Am Morgen nach dem Erwachen. Ich bekam eben im Traum einen Brief von Ernst Jünger. Auf dem Absender standen die Worte: Ernst Jünger / In den Bergen Österreichs / Auf der Reise nach den Schneebergen Asiens. - Ich öffnete vorsichtig den Umschlag und begann, die netzartig über das Papier ausgeworfene Schrift zu entziffern. Da wurde mir klar, dass alles nur Traum sei, aber ich behielt die Augen geschlossen und las weiter. Dabei nahm ich mir vor, nichts dort zu suchen, was mir schmeicheln könnte. Nach einigen freundlichen Sätzen fand ich eine tiefgründige Kritik: "Sie haben viel getan, um ihre Tage zu runden, aber Tage runden sich ganz von selber." Auch wurde mir gesagt, dass ich meine Gedanken nicht nur in Briefen aufschreiben dürfe, sondern auch Tagebuchaufzeichnungen für mich ganz allein machen müsse. Das ist um so merkwürdiger, als ich erst vor kurzer Zeit in einem Brief den Gedanken aufschrieb, dass der Dialog dem Monologe überlegen sei. - Schliesslich zweifelte ich doch daran, dass der Brief, den ich vor mit hatte, nur ein Traumbild sei. Ich riss die Augen auf und tippte auf das Papier - aber ich hatte nur auf die Bettdecke getippt, und nun war alles verloren. Aber ich wurde mir dabei klar, welch reiche Fischzüge wir im Reich des Traumes machen können. und wie objektiv die Dinge sind, die wir dort finden. - So sah ich ganz deutlich den Brief vor mir, und obwohl ich wusste, dass es nur Traum war, war ich doch von einer solchen Neugier gepackt, dass ich wie ein Schlafwandler weiter las. Ich weiss noch, dass ich beim Öffnen des Couverts mich bemühte, es nicht zu zerreissen. (273 words)

Ich stand mit Gisela vor dem Gebäude, in dessen 11. Stockwerk sich das Zimmer befand. Die drei obersten Stockwerke waren einsturzgefährdet, weil der Dachstuhl, aus dem sie als Giebel hervorragten, zu weich war. Gisela erzählte, dass sie schon damals Befürchtungen gehabt hätte, als sie in dem Zimmer gelegen hatte. (Erinnerungen an die Zimmerklinik) Teilweise war es auch in Hannover - es handelte sich um das Wiederfinden des Gebäudes und die Orientierung in den Strassen (Louisenhof) - und später in München. Hier kam ich mit Emmi zusammen dorthin. Ich wollte noch einige vergessene Sachen in dem Zimmer zusammen suchen, doch Emmi strebte heraus, weil sie zu sehr an die Zeit erinnert wurde, in der sie ganz dort gewohnt hatte (Jugendberghaus in Bayrischzell). - Mit Ika handelte es sich um eine Korrespondenz auf einer Postkarte mit einem Bild des Hauses, auf der sie das Fenster ihres Zimmers mit einem Kreuz bezeichnet hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0219 (1950-05-09 - Göttingen)Wieder im Hause künftiger Wohnherren, bei denen auch Alli und Emmi wohnen sollen. Sie wohnen in einem entzückenden und königlich gepflegten Barocklandhaus. Die Kunst des Blumeneinstellens ist dort entwickelt wie in China, und mit grossem Genuss helfe ich, die Blumenstile in den Vasen zurechtrücken, auf deren Glasur noch feuchte Tröpfchen hängen. Es ist eine ideale Welt. - Vorher teilweise Wohnung auf einem Dachboden, den man nur auf dem Bauche oder Rücken kriechend erreichen kann. Ich habe dabei Angst, meine grauen Anzug, den ich so liebe, zu strapazieren. Dort oben ist es erdrückend schwül und dumpfig. Ich öffne eine Dachluke. Frische Luft. Unten wohnt Vater. Er hat ein Radio, das erst umgepolt werden muss, um richtigen Empfang zu geben. Wir haben Gleichstrom. Im Keller wirkt Emmi mit einer Hilfskraft. Grosse Wäsche. Später - das war vor dem Einzug in das gepflegte Landhaus - mit Alli zusammen wartend auf dem Hof. Wir haben gleichzeitig ein Pferd, einen Hund (wie Pfiffi) und ein Baby (im Wagen) zu hüten, die schwer zu bändigen sind. Dass das Pferd nicht in den Kinderwagen schlägt, der Hund nicht zu dem Baby kommt. Doch gelingt mit Mühe die Direktion aller dieser unbändigen Kräfte, an der ich eine gewisse Freude empfinde. Dann ist der Eintritt in das weite Haus und das Gespräch mit der wohlgesinnten Frau wie eine grosse Erquickung und Belohnung. Ich fühle mich wie der Fisch ins Wasser geworfen. Auch hierbei habe ich den Hund an der Leine, die er bis zum äussersten straff zieht. Ich helfe der Frau, die Tischchen zwischen den Blumenvasen umzusetzen, und sie sagt dabei: "nur langsam". Ich fühle mich in einer königlichen Atmosphäre, in der man das Gewicht der Dinge, die man hebt, erkennt. Ein unbeschreibliches Glücksgefühl erfüllt mich - noch jetzt in der Erinnerung, in der die Dinge unverrückbar mit der Gestalt Giselas verbunden sind. - Übrigens, die Kräfte des Kindes beruhen in der Schwerkraft des Wagens, der oft kaum vom Pferde fern zu halten ist.

Mich fasste ein Schauder bei der Vorstellung, dass nun alles, worin ich lange Zeit gelebt hatte, vernichtet sei. Auf der Treppe begegnete mir gleich, völlig verzweifelt, mein Bruder, und ich tröstete ihn sehr. Die vordere Zimmerfront des Hauses war ausgebrannt. Die Möbel unseres Zimmers waren alle gerettet und standen bereits wieder in anderer Zusammenordnung in einem kleineren Raum des Hauses. Auch Stresaus hatten fast alles gerettet. Dagegen waren die Möbel in den Zimmern des Arztes über uns vernichtet. Die Feuerwehr rollte bereits die Schläuche zusammen, und mich beschäftigte der Gedanke, dass in dieser Situation es einmal wirklich berechtigt sei, was man als Kind so oft gemacht habe: Abends aus dem Fenster schauen, ob das Haus nicht brenne.

Das Ganze hing wohl zusammen mit einem fremdsprachigen Text, den wir vorher in einem Seminar lasen, wobei wir ziemlich schnell den Stoff bewältigten, der nur 3 Kapitel umfasste. Doch spielten hier auch Märcheninhalte hinein. Es war eine andere Fassung des Filminhaltes (Schneewittchen), den ich gestern sah. - Andere Traumelemente: ein Tanzfest, der Sportlerball, den ich mit Margund mitmachte, hier aber in kirchlicher Umgebung - und der Wunsch, etwas auszuleihen (das Grammophon, das ich gestern für Rudolf von einem Theologiestudenten entleihen sollte) hier aber eine Harke oder anderes Gartengerät. Hier spielte wieder die Frau eines Studentenpfarrers hinein. Im Grunde wohl die Gestalt der Frau vom Sportinstitut, die mich durch die Gartennachbarschaft zu Giselas Garten kannte. Doch trug die Frau die Züge eines Mädchens, die ich gestern in dem Film (Kino) sah und vom Volkstanz her kenne, die einen ganz bestimmten Typ verkörpert, wie ihn Pfarrersfrauen oft haben. Freundlich, unternehmungslustig, stolz, mit Elan, aber etwas auf bestimmte Geleise eingefahren, so dass man nicht immer mit ihnen zusammen bleiben möchte. (195 words)

Dann ein neues Abwehrmittel gegen die Krankheit, das uns in Form einer süssen, schokoladen- oder chremeartigen Speise von einem Arzt gereicht wurde. Im Erwachen Gedanke an Helga E. In den Traum spielte die Szene eines Tanzfestes hinein in einem Hause, in dem diese Krankheit herrschte. Ich wurde untersucht und zeigte bereits latente Symptome, so ein Erlaschen der Körperspannung. Ich fiel in mich zusammen und wurde dem Bilde des Hirsches ähnlich, dem der Kopf hintenüber hing. Auch erwartete ich die geistigen Folgen der Krankheit. - Als ich aber von der Speise gegessen hatte, fühlte ich mich frisch gestärkt, und nach dem Erwachen fiel mir die heitere Melodie einer Arie aus einer Bachschen Pfingstkantate ein, die ich gestern in der Kirche hörte und die mich sehr berührte, weil ich sie in den letzten Wochen oft von J.H.F. hörte, wenn ich bei Gisela zu Besuch war (174 words)

Ferber verteidigt mich, es sei bei mir bloss das Streben, mich möglichst kurz aufzudrücken. Die Dinge, die ich "in Hamburg geschrieben" habe, seien in der Form sehr schön.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0246 (1950-05-31 - Göttingen)Träumte heute Nacht von Jürgen Wächter, dass er nicht gefallen, sondern aus der Gefangenschaft heimgekehrt sei. Die Nachricht von seinem Tode stellte sich als Verwechslung heraus, deren Einzelheiten er mir genau erzählte. Auch bezog sich unser Gespräch hauptsächlich auf militärische Dinge, auf die Truppenansammlungen zur Zeit des Kriegsendes in der Stadt Göttingen. Diese Truppen befanden sich hauptsächlich in dem Gelände nordöstlich der Stadt, in dem ich im vorigen Sommer meine grossen Spaziergänge machte und das ich seitdem nur selten betreten habe. - Die Initiation zu dem Traum mit Jürgen Wächter war folgendermassen: Ich nahm mit Gisela an einem Seminar des Psychotherapeuten Kühnel teil, obwohl sie eigentlich nicht dafür angemeldet war. Als er in der Beziehung einmal eine allgemeine Frage stellte, wollte ich sie zurückhalten, sich noch nachträglich zu melden, weil es im Gedränge gar nicht aufgefallen wäre. Sie aber tauschte wie selbstverständlich einige Blicke mit ihm und erhielt seine Bestätigung. Nach Beendigung des Seminars hatte ich noch zwei Stunden Zeit bis zu Beginn des Kurses in der Rasemühle und hatte nun die Wahl, diese Stunden mit Gisela zu verbringen, oder Christian aus dem Webetanz zu diktieren. Wir standen noch unschlüssig vor seinem Haus, als Christian erschien und mir Jürgens Ankunft verkündigte. Dann wechselte die Szene und ich war mit diesem zusammen. Nach dem militärischen Gespräch erwähnte ich etwas aus unserer Vergangenheit - ich glaube, es bezog sich auf seine Veranlagung für psychologische Dinge. - Da sagte er: "Es ist schön, wenn Du mich an diese Zeit erinnerst. Sie ist meiner Erinnerung ganz entfallen." (253 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0249 (1950-06-04 - Göttingen)Ich spielte im Traum die Rolle eines hohen Offiziers, in der ich eine Parade abnehmen musste, wobei immer neue Menschen an mir vorbeizogen. (In dieser Art stehe ich manchmal am Fenster und beobachte die Strassenpassanten.) Die Szene bildete einen Ausschnitt aus einem langen Film, in den immer wieder das Erwachen wie das Aufleuchten des Lichts im Zuschauerraum einspielte. Eine Zeit lang war ich ganz wach und erwartete das Einschlafen, um den Film weiterzusehen. Es war ein langer französischer Film voller mimischer Feinheiten (Etwa in der Form der "Kinder des Olymp", die ich aus Giselas Schilderung her kenne). Einmal in einer Szene, in der das Wort dominierte, hatte ich die Augen geschlossen. Ich wurde geweckt durch das Klatschen der Zuschauer und sah, als ich die Augen öffnete, eine bezaubernde Szene: Kinder auf einem kleinen Karussell, das sich in feiner Rhythmik wiegte. Ich war erstaunt über die Bannkraft dieses Spiels, die so gross war, dass sie das Bewusstsein der blossen Technik des Vorgangs durchbrach. Im Kino klatscht man sonst ja nicht, weil niemand gegenwärtig ist, der den Beifall entgegennehmen könnte. - Bei einer Szene im Gespräch mit Emmi, die neben mir sass, über Geisteskrankheit. Ich erklärte ihr, dass solche Krankheit oftmals körperlich bedingt sei. (Lektüre gestern abend. - Muddings Arteriosklerose.) Mudding sass in einem Stuhl vor uns und genoss den Film. (Fortsetzung des Traumtextes aus dem Kontext:) So entwickelte sich die Traumszene auch aus einer anderen Handlung, in der ich das Gelände des Filmateliers durchschritt und den Gesprächen einiger Fachleute über die Möglichkeiten lauschte, die diese Landschaft böte. Es war eine Landschaft, ähnlich der des kleinen Friedhofs am Wall, auf dem ein Teil des Films "die Nachtwache" gedreht wurde und die eine grosse Rolle spielt in dem System, das die Strassen und Wege dieser Stadt in meinem Unterbewusstsein bilden. In einer anderen Szene des Traums sagte mir Margund, dass sie sich ganz von mir lösen wolle. (314 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0250 (1950-06-05 - Göttingen)In einer grossen Töpferei auf dem Lande. Ich trug ein mächtiges Tongefäss ohne Boden, den Teil eines grösseren Gebildes, in ein scheunenartiges Gebäude. Vor dem Eingang begegnete mir die Meisterin mit den Käufern dieses Gefässes, die sich beschwerten, dass sie den Eingang in das Gebäude nicht gefunden hätten. Drinnen seien lauter so stachelige Kakteen. Sie forderte sogleich von ihnen für das grosse Teilstück, das ich trug, Bezahlung. Sie könne dafür allein das Risiko nicht mehr tragen. Ich wusste nun, das ich sehr vorsichtig damit umgehen musste. Ich rief mir zwei in der Nähe Arbeitende herbei, um es noch einmal vorsichtig abzusetzen und dann erneut aufzunehmen und in die Scheune zu tragen. Drinnen war es plötzlich ein Gerippe, das ich zu transportieren hatte. Ich legte es mit einer anderen Hilfe sehr sorgfältig Stück für Stück hinter der Tür an der Wand in der gepflasterten Diele nieder. Es bestand aus drei Teilen: Kopf, Schultern und dem oberen Teil der Wirbelsäule. Das stellte ich etwas hochgekantet in die Ecke hinter der Tür. Dann das Mittelstück mit den Rippen, was ungefähr die Form der zylinderförmigen Gefässwand hatte, die ich im Anfang tragen musste, - überhaupt waren alle Teile des Gerippes sehr stilisiert - und als dritten Teil die Beckenknochen mit den Hüften und den Beinen. (Ich lag gestern lange in der Obstplantage und betrachtete die Menschen, die sich dort sonnten. Die Einteilung des Gerippes ist stark beeinflusst einerseits von der sexuellen Betonung des Körpers - Hüften, Beine, Becken - andererseits von der Art, wie die zweiteiligen Badeanzüge einen Frauenkörper aufteilen). - Ich war sehr besorgt, die Teile möglichst natürlich hinzulegen, damit die Angehörigen von dem Anblick nicht betroffen seien. Dann ging mein Gehilfe weg, und ich stand nun allein bei dem Gerippe, das hinter der Tür im Schatten lag, während die Sonne auf das Steinpflaster schien. Doch da entdeckte ich hinter dem anderen Türflügel im Schatten einen grossen dunklen Schmetterling, der die Rolle eines Aasgeiers spielte. Ich mochte darum das Gerippe nicht allein lassen und rief den jungen Herrn v. B. herein, den ich im Hintergrund der Scheune sah - die Szene spielte jetzt in Wittmoldt. - Wir packten das Gerippe in einen Sarg, ohne die Teile noch einmal anfassen zu müssen, denn es lag jetzt in Holzwolle, wie man sie in Särgen hat, war auch mit solcher bedeckt und das Ganze in ein grosses Papier gehüllt (weihnachtspapierartig), an dem wir es nur zu ergreifen brauchten, um das Ganze Bündel in den schwarzen Sarg zu versenken. Ich hatte Sorgen, dass es nicht hineinpassen würde, doch es passte haargenau. (Hier spielen Erinnerungen von der Einsargung meines Vaters eine grosse Rolle, die ja in Wittmoldt vor sich ging). Ich wollte noch einmal hineinsehen, ob die drei Teile des Gerippes auch richtig lägen, doch sagte man mir, dies sei nicht nötig, die Angehörigen würden doch nicht mehr hineinsehen und sie lägen auch richtig. - Übrigens trug mein Gehilfe beim ersten Niederlegen der Teile die Züge eines Psychologen, den ich gestern beim Sonnen in der Obstplantage traf und der mir beiläufig drei Träume über Plessner analysierte, die ich ihm erzählte) (512 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0257 (1950-06-10 - Göttingen)Besuch bei Rudolf (Jaentzsch) vor seiner Abreise. Ich half ihm noch die Schubladen durchsehen, ob er auch nichts vergessen hatte. - Auf dem Balkan: Betrachtung der Meereswogen am Strand. Doch hörte ich nichts. - Einen dritten Teil des Traums hatte ich heute Nacht schon Wort für Wort zur Niederschrift überlegt und war am Morgen auch des Glaubens, ihn aufgeschrieben zu haben. Jetzt habe ich ausser einem diffusen Sitationsgefühl, dass es sich um ein Mitschreiben verbunden mit Radiohören handelte und andere Personen dabei eine Rolle spielten, fast alles vergessen: Ich erinnere mich noch dunkel, das ich eigentlich nichts zu schreiben wusste, wohl weil ich nur hören wollte. Auch stand der Traum mit dem Bild von der Meeresbrandung in Zusammenhang, und ich weiss, dass in dem ganzen Traumgebilde und seiner geplanten Suchschrift das Gleichgewicht, das Bild einer Waage, eine Rolle spielte. Heute Morgen erwachte ich mit dem Gefühl, mein seelisches Gleichgewicht verloren zu haben. In dieser Niederschrift scheint es mir wiederhergestellt.-- (Später im Tagebuch dieses Tags:) Plötzlich fällt mir der Traum ein, den ich heute Nacht vergessen habe. Ich ging zu Ru . ach das hab ich ja schon aufgeschrieben - also doch nicht der vergessene Teil.- Die richtige Verbindung von philosophischer und naturwissenschaftlicher Psychologie scheint mir ein Schlüssel zur richtigen Vermittlung idealistischer und realistischer Weltansichten zu bilden. (Einfall bei der Lektüre von "Sein und Zeit". - Der Gedanke kündigte sich übrigens durch einen Pfiff an, der meinen Bruder zu den verwunderten Worten veranlasste "Was ist denn mit Dir los?" ( Erste Erwähnung von "Sein und Zeit". Vorhergegangen ein längeres Tagebuchstück über Kretschmers "Medizinische Psychologie") - ( In dem dem diesem Traum 257 vorhergehenden Tagebuch ist von Gisela und Franz die Rede. - Rudolf, ich und Franz waren nacheinander ihre Freude. Rudolf wart in Bulgarien geboren ). (295 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0258 (1950-06-11 - Göttingen)Die Gespräche des Traums und des Halbbewussten registriere ich mehr in klanglicher Art. Ich kann dann meine Erinnerung belauschen und die Worte und Sätze aufschreiben, oft ohne ihren Sinn zu verstehen. Erst später an Hand der Nachschrift oder wach bewusster Erinnerung wird mir dann oft der Sinn deutlich. So entstehen wohl manche Gedanken und Conceptionen durch ein halb probierendes Vorsichhinsprechen. Sie kommen ins Bewusstsein wie das Ende eines abgerissene Films. Wenn irgend ein äusseres Geräusch mich stört, ist dann manchmal die akustische Erinnerung verloren - Heute Nacht träumte ich etwas von Bille und es ging um die Frage, ob sie basedowoid veranlagt sei. (Hier ist wohl etwas von Gisela auf Bille übertragen) - Das Hören von Stimmen ist für meine Träume recht charakteristisch - meist verbunden mit dem motorischen Erlebnis des eigene Sprechens - so wie man manchmal im Erwachen sich selber - aber von innen heraus - schnarchen hört. Das gibt dann ein dröhnendes, rasselndes Geräusch und Empfinden, das wie durch einen Schlund zu strudeln scheint. So ähnlich sind auch hier Gehör und Sprachempfinden im Traumgespräch gekoppelt. Zuweilen allerdings - und zwar im tieferen Traum - sind die Sätze auch eindeutig fremden Personen zugeordnet und es gibt richtige Gespräche. (200 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0259 (1950-06-13 - Göttingen)Träumte heute Nacht von Frl. Av. und Gisela, mit denen ich einen Koffer eine steile Bodentreppe hinauftragen musste. Ich war eifersüchtig, denn die beiden waren verheiratet. Nur war mir die Situation nicht ganz klar. Der Dachboden war sehr eng und spitzwinklig. Wenn man die Fensterluken öffnete, wurden die Wäscheleinen mit hochgerissen, die an deren Griffen befestigt waren. Zuletzt sank ich vor Giselas Füssen in mich zusammen und diese tröstete mich sehr.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0260 (1950-06-13 - Göttingen)Ein anderer Traum: Ich sah einen Ausschnitt aus einem sehr raffinierten Film. Eine Uhr in schematischer Gestalt eines Vogels, der die Zeit verschlingt (Trickaufnahme - ähnlich wie im Scheewittchenfilm) und erst gesättigt ist, als er Krieg ausgestossen hat. Dann wechselt das Bild. Man sieht von oben auf einen grossen Platz voller Menschen und Getriebe. Dann wird dieser Platz einmal herumgeschwenkt wie der Boden einer Luftschaukel, die sich überschlägt, dass alle Menschen auf dem Kopf stehen, oder als machte der Kameramann einen Louping. - Ich sitze sehr versunken in meinem Zuschauerstuhl und merke kaum, wie ich von der Platzanweiserin angestossen werde, weil ich mit meiner Karte auf einem zu teuren Platz sitze. Erwachen. (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0261 (1950-06-14 - Göttingen)Um ein Haar fiel ich in ein Wasserloch beim Vollschöpfen der Giesskanne. Dann drohte mir der Eimer im Morast zu versinken. Zuletzt konnte ich die gefüllten Gefässe nicht über die glitschige Böschung hochkriegen. Dann wachte ich auf und war sichtlich erleichtert, dass ich mich darum nun nicht mehr zu kümmern brauchte. In einem der Nachbargärten sah ich beim Hinweg einen Mann ganz unbekleidet bei der Arbeit auf der Erde knien. Als Grund dafür gab er an, er habe einen Sonnenbrand und könne darum keine Kleidung auf der Haut vertragen. (89 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0262 (1950-06-15 - Göttingen)Sah heute Nacht im Traum einen wunderbaren Film. Ein sehr gepflegtes Institutsgebäude - gleichzeitig Erholungsheim - mit vielen gekachelten Badeanlagen wird von einer Truppe belegt. Der Mann, der die Belegung anordnet, trägt eine grosse metallene Kette um den Hals, die gleichzeitig wie die Kette einer militärischen Frontpolizei und wie die Kette eines Kanzlers aussieht. Der Mann ist auch der Vorgesetzte der Truppe. Er verhandelt mit einer Frau, der die Obhut über das Haus anvertraut ist. Während dieser Verhandlung, die an einem Tisch vor sich geht, an dem auch die ganze Truppe wie zu einer Mahlzeit versammelt ist, zeigt der Mann sehr geistige Züge. Fast die Physiognomie eines Schauspielers. Er hofft, der Frau das Heim nach Ende des Krieges - so deutet er an - unversehrt wieder übergeben zu können, oder eventuell beschädigte Einrichtungen dann wiederherzustellen - wenn es dann überhaupt noch eine Technik gäbe, mit der das möglich sei - so deutet er an -, was allerdings fraglich und auch nicht wünschenswert wäre. Man spürt, dass er sich eine orientalische Kultur wünscht, in der die Zweckkategorie eine untergeordnete Rolle spielt. Später weist der Mann seine Truppe an, in die Räume einzuziehen: "Aber seht Euch vor, dass Ihr nichts kaputt macht". Dann geht er die Treppe zum Ausgang hinab, und ich spiele nun diese Rolle. Vor der Tür hält mich ein Mann an, der eine Uniform trägt, die an Polizei und Luftschutz erinnert: "Wo willst Du hin?" - "Nach draussen" - "Aber doch nicht im Schlafanzug!" - Ich schaue meine Uniform an. Sie trägt keinerlei Abzeichen und zeigt bewusst vereinfachte Formen. Ich drehe mich um und zeige auf Andere, die auch die Treppe runter kommen: "Kuck mal, die gehen alle im Schlafanzug". Nun gehe ich unangefochten aus der Tür. Draussen sehe ich auf einer Wiese einen Jungen, der ein wildes Pferd am Zaum führt. Es bricht immer wieder aus, und schliesslich sieht man beide stürzen. Ich fürchte, dass der Junge vom Pferd verletzt ist, doch beide erheben sich langsam. Doch nun sind es zwei Pferde, die sich jagen, ein Rappe und ein gescheckter Schimmel. Sie kommen gefährlich nah auf mich zu. Doch nun ist schon die ganze Weide voller Pferde. Menschen sieht man dazwischen gehen, andere spielen Fussball, alles tummelt sich durcheinander. Ich muss zuweilen ausweichen, um nicht umgerannt zu werden. Dann entdecke ich zwischen den Menschen auch sehr primitive und derbe Gesichter aus vorgeschichtlicher Zeit. Es leuchtet mir ein, dass wir uns in einer Zeit befinden, in der hochgradig verfeinerte Rassen mit solchen primitiven Frühtypen durcheinander leben (Ferner Anklang an Heliopolis). Einer von ihnen zielt mit einem Revolver - so zum Spass - auf einen anderen. Ich untersage es ihm. Darauf richtet er den Revolver grinsend auf mich. Es fällt mir ein, dass ich ihm scharf in die Augen sehen muss, um Macht über ihn zu haben. Während ich es tue und dabei langsam erwache, sehe ich noch undeutlich, wie hinter einem Schleier, so wie die Dinge bei einem überkonzentrierten und hypnotischen Blick erscheinen, dass ihm der Revolver aus der Hand sinkt. Dann erscheint noch für einen Augenblick eine Tür mit der Aufschrift "Grusssitten nach Stresemann", wobei mir einleuchtet, dass sich die Grusssitten auf die Weise des überlegenen Blicks beziehen, der Name Stresemann aber die Figur des Kanzlers andeuten soll. Im Erwachen fühle ich mich sehr heiter und befreit. Ich habe das Gefühl, mit den elementaren Mächten frei spielen zu können. - In einem vorhergehenden Traum war ich mit Emmi und Tessen-Werner in einem Zimmer ähnlich der elterlichen Wohnung in Schwerin und stellte fest, dass man weit drüben am anderen Ufer in die Zimmer der erleuchteten Häuser einblicken konnte. Es war eine hoher Genuss in dieser Überdeutlichkeit, und die Situation hatte ein wenig von der Atmosphäre des van Goghschen Bildes einer erleuchteten Nacht, in der unendliche Lichter sich in einem grossen Wasser spiegeln.

Dabei Szenenwechsel: wie auf einem Bahnhof. Beinahe hätte ich dem Kellner in der Enge das Tablett aus der Hand gestossen. - Ursel G. findet auf ihrem Sitzplatz Emmis Handtäschchen* und Portemonnaie. Dort finde ich den vierten Pfennig. Auf meinem Platz findet sich ein sehr hübsches Handtäschchen und ein Elfenbeingegenstand. Ich stecke es ein, um später die Besitzerin ausfindig zu machen. Am Ende ist mir das peinlich. - Auf dem Bahnhof musste ich noch allerhand in den Koffer packen. Dadurch droht das Frachtgeld teurer zu werden. Es war an sich erstaunlich billig.

Die letzten Löschmannschaften verlassen die brüchige Fassade kurz, eh sie einzustürzen droht. - 2. Ein Märchenfilm wird im Theater vorgeführt. Figuren u.a: Die böse Hexe und der Jägersmann. Die Hexe geht ins Wasser, damit der Jägersmann nicht seinen Hund auf sie loslassen kann. Als das der Hund neben mir auf dem Stuhl wahrnimmt, wird er sehr unruhig und will von seinem Platze los. Plötzlich wird der Film unterbrochen Ein Mann mit einem Korporalsbart* tritt auf die Bühne und sagt: "Es tut mir leid - aber die Theaterangelegenheit steht auch nicht ganz in meiner Macht.

Gisela marschiert in ihrem Zug in einem der ersten Glieder. Sie kuckt ganz starr nach vorne und hört unser Rufen nicht, und ihre Augen sind mit Tränen gefüllt. Dann laufen wir hinterher und dann ist sie selig. Hinterher noch Gespräche über den Koffer mit dem Vater. Jeder der Tonklumpen hat den Namen eines Schutzheiligen. Bloss einer fehlt, er ging nicht mehr in den Koffer, aber dieser Schutzheilige passt auch nicht für die Wanderschaft in der fremdem Stadt. Darum sagt der Vater, war es ganz richtig, dass er nicht mitkam. - Der Koffer war ein gelber Lederkoffer und ich kriegte ihn kaum zu.

Schon der Gedanke, da herab springen zu müssen, ist mir furchtbar. (Angst immer noch Nachwirkung des Coffeins). - Ein Pferd will mich beissen. - Ein Hausmeister verteilt das Essen. Ich helfe ihm. Für mich bleibt nichts übrig. Ich bin enttäuscht, denn ich habe Hunger. Er winkt mich zu sich und überreicht mir eine grosse Tüte Bonbons. Indem er einen herausnimmt und mir schenkt, deutet er an, dass ich die anderen bezahlen soll. Ich kaufe sie- wider Willen - denn Bonbons zu kaufen lässt meine wirtschaftliche Lage garnicht zu, und ich hätte lieber etwas richtiges zu essen. (Symbolbedeutung für das gehemmte sexuelle Habenwollen) - In einer anderen Traumszene in einem Bücherladen schenkt mir der Verkäufer drei Stück Kuchen für mich und Herrn Specht (Wir kauften gestern Nachmittag Kuchen in einem Bäckerladen, in dem allerdings nur Verkäuferinnen waren, - und assen ihn zu dem Kaffee.) - Der Verkäufer sagt, dass dies Geschenk ihm garnichts ausmache, dass es auch garnicht weiter zu bewerten sei. Er zeigt uns und anderen ein Kofferradio, das er sich gekauft hat. Er entlockt ihn immer andere Musik, indem er den Finger immer an einer anderen Stelle an die Antenne hält. (An unseren Schreibtisch ist ein Draht gespannt, um die Beine zusammen zu halten, der immer andere Töne gibt, wenn man ihn zupft wie eine Saite - je nachdem, ob man den Draht länger oder kürzer hält.) - Aus dem Kofferradio kommt von allen Sendern nur Tanzmusik, obgleich ich gerne schwere Musik gehört hätte. - In dem Traum klangen auch die Strassenverhältnisse aus dem nächtlichen Traum von Krischan und Rosmarie wieder an.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0272 (1950-06-24 - Göttingen)Ein anderer Traum in Filmform, den ein Professor erfunden hat. Die Gesichter sind alle bewusst energisch und etwas bürgerlich steif gezeichnet. Es handelt sich um einen Mann, der einem moderne Grossinquisitor in die Hände fällt und mit einer scheusslichen Krankheit vergiftet werden soll. Die Assistentin aber, die mit einem kleine Messerchen den Mann mit Bazillen heimlich impfen soll, ritzt stattdessen damit den Grossinquisitor, obgleich dieser sich bis zum äussersten wehrt und selbst versucht, mit einem anderen Messer zuvor das Mädchen auf dieselbe Weise ausser Kampf zu setzen. Als aber seine Haut mit dem Messer berührt ist, schlägt er sofort den Kragen hoch, lehnt sich zurück und erwartet den Tod. Man sieht und hört, wie ihn die Vorstellung rauschenden Blutes an seinem Arm quält. Dann aber kommt er auf die satanische Idee, durch einen Kuss den Mann, den er vergiften wollte, nun doch noch anzustecken. Auch dieser zeigt sofort Erschlaffung und Verzerrung und äussert Angst davor, die Pest bekommen zu haben. Zuletzt steckt er ihm noch seine eigene angerauchte Zigarre in den Mund, um so die Infektion zu vollenden. (178 words)

Sie ist die Frau eines Diplomaten. Als nächstes kommt ein Soldat, der alles zerstören will, was sie heilgelassen hat. Aber auch er ist gebildet und erzählt mir von der "Germanistik" in einem Nachbarstaat, eine Art von "Deutschem Institut". Wir befinden uns in einem slavischen Land.Ich breche aus, werde verfolgt und suche mein rotes Auto. Hier wache ich allmählich auf, setze aber den Traum fort, bis er zuletzt in Gedanken übergeht.

Er sagt: "Das ist der Vogelfall". Dann schlägt ein toter Vogelkörper vor unseren Füssen auf, und schon hat sich der Schwarm zu einer schwarzen Wolke verdichtet. Ich schaue den toten Körper lange und betroffen an, während mein Begleiter den Vorgang für selbstverständlich hält, der die Initiationshandlung zum Schwärmen bildet. (93 words)

Dann gibt er mir noch eine zweites 50 Pfg. Stück, damit ich mir im Erfrischungsraum etwas Nettes kaufen kann. (65 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0290 (1950-07-12 - Göttingen)Nachmittagsschlaf. Traum: Gespräche mit Herrn Specht über Hartmanns Philosophie - und zwar in Hartmanns Haus und in Gegenwart von dessen Frau.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0291 (1950-07-13 - Göttingen)Ich trat in einer Ecke des Zimmers auf etwas Zusammengerolltes, papier- oder stoffartiges. ich hob es mit dem gekrallten Fuss auf und nahm es in die Hand. Es war das Taschentuch von Margund, die dort vorher gesessen und geweint hatte. Aber eigentlich war es Giselas Taschentuch, denn es hatte einen Spitzenrand. Ich roch daran und berührte es mit der Haut des Gesichtes. Dann tastete ich mit den Fingern, um das Monogramm M zu finden. Doch, bevor ich es gefunden hatte, erwachte ich. (82 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0292 (1950-07-14 - Göttingen)Ich träumte von einem Mädchen, das sich später als verkleideter Mann entpuppte, ohne doch dabei seine Fraulichkeit eigentlich einzubüssen. Spionagezusammenhänge spielten herein. Doch stand ich immer auf ihrer Seite. Die Männlichkeit erkannte ich daran, dass sie eine Badehose trug, in der das männliche Glied in einem geschlossenen Ärmel steckte. Ich empfand diese Lösung als glücklich und sehr ehrlich. (58 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0293 (1950-07-18 - Göttingen)Traum von Gisela. Zunächst gemeinsame Fahrt mit einer Strassenbahn aus der Stadt heraus - am Faulen See (Schwerin) vorbei. - Dann in ein kleines Haus. Dort waren wir sehr glücklich (Einfall: Fahrt zum Elternhaus in der Cäcilienallee) Dann Mutti. Sie war schon sehr krank und wie aus einer anderen Welt. Sie brachte ich in die Stadt zurück (Markt in Göttingen) Sie konnte kaum noch gehen - doch war sie in allen Bewegungen wie schwebend. Ich brachte sie viele Treppen hoch in ihre Stube. Ich hatte keine Angst vor Ansteckung an ihrer Krankheit. Wie mussten an vielen Blumen vorbei, die teilweise den Weg auf der Treppe fast verstellten. Doch alles war sehr glücklich. -Dann Vater. Er war in seiner Krankheit schon ganz wirr, doch von phantastischer Konsequenz in seiner Psycho-Logik. Er lag in seinem Bett und seine Bilder quälten ihn sehr. Es waren alles Bilder des Kampfes. Nachher stieg er einfach in mein Bett, wozu er mit einmal Kobolz schoss. Ich fing alle Bewegungen mit Ruhe auf und liess ihn möglichst gewähren, um es ihm nicht schwer zu machen. (Erst bei den Einfällen aufgeschrieben): Bei Gisela kam übrigens ein anderer Mann, der etwas mit ihrer Musik zu tun hatte und uns sehr bedrohte. Er kriegte einen Kinnhaken. Dann waren wir wieder alleine. (211 words)

Dort sitzen Andere, die nicht gestört werden dürfen, in der Halle beim Essen, unter ihnen Christian und Dieter. (72 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0296 (1950-07-23 - Göttingen)Ich wachte gestern vor dem Einschlafen noch einmal mit einem Fall-Schreck auf, weil ich mich nicht wie gewöhnlich auf die rechte sondern auf die linke Seite gelegt hatte. Der Schreck bestand darin, dass ich auf ein Siel in der Strasse trat, das meinem Tritt nachgab, wobei es sich sozusagen um seine eigene Achse drehte und mein Fuss zu versinken drohte. Solche Traumbilder sind bei mir häufig. (66 words)

Er musste über Hartmanns Beine steigen, die dieser beim Sitzen in den Gang gestellt hatte. Er dachte offenbar, die Vorlesung hätte noch nicht angefangen, weil alles so legèr war. (75 words)

Ich bin allein im Wagen, in dem als einzigem kein Gaslicht, sondern eine anderes brennt. Ich überlege einen Moment, ob ich mich im Klo einschliessen solle. Tue es aber nicht, weil dort entdeckt zu werden, wegen der Offensichtlickeit des Versteckens die sichere Verhaftung bringen würde. Ich gehe ganz nach vorne in dem Zug in der Hoffnung, dass die Lokomotive schon auf deutschen Boden steht. Der Zug steht auf der Oderbrücke. - Vorher Traum von einer Eisenbahnfahrt in Afrika. Die meisten Menschen gehen in die völlig offenen Wagen. Ich ziehe den gedeckten wegen des Schattens vor. Ich habe einen Schein, von dem ich nicht genau weiss, ob er ein Geldschein oder ein Fahrschein ist. Der eingeborene Schaffner identifiziert ihn als Fahrschein. - Von hier ging dann der Traum wohl in den zuerst beschriebenen über. Dazwischen noch ein Bindeglied. Ich sitze allein im Wagen und habe keinen richtigen Fahrschein. - Ich lenke den Schaffner durch ein Gespräch über die gaslose Beleuchtung ab. Auch handelt es sich darum, dass ich in diesem Wagen ja kein Gasgeld zu bezahlen brauche und dadurch irgendwie gerechtfertigt bin. (190 words)

Ich lag im Bett, von einem Wandschirm umgeben, durch dessen Ritze er während dieses Gesprächs guckte, denn er sass nebenan in einem Sessel. Diese Situation war dadurch entstanden, dass die Probe in demselben Raum stattfand, in dem ich auch übernachtete.

Um andere Traumbilder wurde ich betrogen, da ich von ihrer Niederschrift nur träumte. Zuletzt Gespräch mit dem Grossherzog über den Roggower. Jetzt fällt mir ein. Es handelte sich bei den anderen Träumen um eine Arbeitssituation. Verdichtung aus HJ-Dienst und Gartenarbeit in Wittmoldt. Eine allgemeine Grosszügigkeit war eingerissen, die durch einen neuen Fanatiker rückgängig gemacht wurde. Bei der Arbeit handelte es sich darum, dass ich meine Kleider, besonders mein Leinenhemd, weiss anstreichen musste (so eben wie ich neulich meine Sandalen weisste). Dazu wurden sie zuerst mit Fett eingerieben, damit die Farbe besser haftete (Sexualakzent - weiss nur nicht wie. Man hat aber hier ein leise mitschwingendes Gefühl dieser Bedeutung). (125 words)

Und das alles während mir die Morgensonne auf den Kopf schien - um 6 Uhr. (Christian hatte mir schon oft von dieser Art des Weckens erzählt. Ich hatte mich darauf gefreut - aber keinen Angsttraunm erwartet.- (vgl. den zweiten Traum der Nacht, s.u.: Traum 309) - Auch Träume von Franz, der mich gestern Abend besuchte. Er hatte ebensolche kleinen bunten Handschuhe, wie mir Gisela einmal schenkte. Ich fürchtete, auch meine kämen von ihm (Bild der Eifersucht). - Dann träumte ich noch, meine Wirtin hätte mir den Kaffee gebracht, und als ich ihn getrunken hatte, entdeckte ich, dass es noch ganz früh war, und es tat mir leid, nicht wieder einschlafen zu können. Auch träumte ich, dass ich meine gewaschenen Strümpfe auf dem Handtuchständer in die Sonne stellen wollte. Und immer gelang es nicht, für sie den Sonnenfleck im Zimmer zu finden. - In dem Gang nach draussen sah ich dämmernde, zauberhafte Landschaft: Ich suchte sie immer dort, wo in Wahrheit Häuser stehen.

Ich merke es daran, dass die Tür zum Arbeitsraum, in den ich gerade gehen will, von selber aufspringt, so dass noch ein Begleiter zu mir sagt: "Siehst Du, die Tür geht extra für Dich auf". Dann aber höre ich das Gehen der Bibliothekstür, deren Luftdruck die andere mit geöffnet hatte, und gleichzeitig mit der Angst um den unerlaubten Einbruch in die mir anvertrauten Räume kommt mir der Gedanke, dass ja nur dieser eine Eingang besteht und mir der Einbrecher unfehlbar in die Arme laufen muss.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0317 (1950-08-10 - Göttingen)Träumte von Lehmann. Er wollte mich im Autobus mitnehmen. Gisela hatte es vermittelt. Ich hatte noch ein Stück Strasse zu laufen bis zur Abfahrt und die Zeit war knapp. Ich fragte einen Strassenpassanten nach dem Weg und er unterrichtete mich gut. An der nächsten Ecke bei dem Turm sei es. (Ich ging gestern einen anderen, mir noch ziemlich unbekannten Weg nach Hause, der mir ziemlich lang erschien. Gisela war gestern bei Lehmann) Aber ich konnte plötzlich nicht ordentlich laufen, als wenn ich steife Beine hätte. Aber ich wusste, dass das in solchen Fällen oft so sei bei mir, und rief das noch den Passanten zu. (Obwohl ich nicht wusste, dass ich im Traum sei, hatte ich doch hier eine Erinnerung, die typisch aus der Traumsphäre stammt. Die Continuität der Traumwelt) Schliesslich sah ich ein Personenauto mit der Aufschrift Fritz Lehmann an der Tür. (Es war sein Volkswagen - doch fällt mir zur Aufschrift der Name ein, der immer an dem Wagen des Dr. Brenkle steht,. nach dessen Auto ich gestern Ausschau hielt, weil meine Verdienstmöglichkeit sich erst bei seiner Rückkunft entscheidet.) Übrigens zu dem Laufen mit steifen Beinen: als ich einmal tief Luft holte und mich locker machte, ging es wieder besser und ich dachte : es ist also doch psychogen (Dazu fällt mir ein meine Neigung zu Krämpfen, die vorgestern bei der Fussmassage immer auftraten und bei denen mir klar wurde, dass psychogene Faktoren starken lösenden und verstärkenden Einfluss darauf haben können.) Schliesslich fand ich noch den Autobus und setzte mich hinein. (So wie gestern, als ich bei der Filmgesellschaft nach Hause fuhr). Dann setzt sich rechts neben mir ein Mädchen, und ich fragte sie, ob sie auch lieber den Fensterplatz haben wollte. - Dann noch Träume vom Schlittenfahren, wo die Jungens sich immer alle gegenseitig überfuhren. Es war halb wie ein Schauerfilm. Ich wusste, dass es nicht so ernst war (Gestern im Autobus fürchtete ich manchmal Zusammenstösse. Misstrauen. Gehemmtes Hingabebedürfnis, Angst.) Schliesslich ein kleiner Junge, der Angst hatte und den ich mit Obst tröstete. Zuletzt kam ich mit dem Obst in Roggow (zugleich Wittmoldt) auf die Diele. Feeli war auch dabei. Wir deckten die unerlaubt gepflückten Bickbeeren mit Äpfeln zu und gingen fix hindurch. Es war gerade Andacht. (Sie wurde in Roggow auf der Diele gehalten. Feeli ist aber in Wittmoldt. Hier also die beiden Güter verdichtet). (389 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0320 (1950-08-13 - Göttingen)Muddings Tod und danach Vaddings Tod (In Wirklichkeit starb Vadding Schultz vor Mudding Schultz). Vadding war aber während Muddings Tod krank und hatte einen Pfleger, einen Gefangenen mit gefesselten Händen, der sehr ungehobelt war. Dann aber hatte er sich wieder erholt und erledigte alles, was notwendig war nach Muddings Tod. Er war stark und kurz wie ein Dragoner. Ich bot ihm meine Hilfe an, aber er wollte alles allein machen. Ich sagte, das sei sehr sympathisch. Dann war die Überlegung, wie Emmi ihn versorgen und gleichzeitig bei uns im Schlossgarten bleiben konnte. Sie wollte ein Zimmer in der Stadt mieten und dort zeitweilig wohnen Sie fuhr ihm Essen in einem Behälter hin. Es wurde viel zu viel eingeladen, und ich wurde dabei mit einer weissen, halbflüssigen Masse, ähnlich Becamell-Kartoffen begossen. (Bild der Ejakulation). Ich nahm es gelassen hin. -. Dann war auch Vadding tot und ich in seiner Wohnung und empfing dort Besuch von vielen Bekannten, die ich einander und meiner später kommenden Schwester vorstellen sollte. Ich brachte aber alle Namen durcheinander. (Ich hatte Gisela vorgestern die Genese des Namenskomplexes erzählt - uneheliches Kind). - Ich nahm es aber nicht tragisch. Ein Mädchen küsste mich. Ich wachte auf.- Fortsetzung des Traums nach dem Einschlafen: Franzens und mein Zimmer liegen in zwei Häusern nebeneinander, und zwar merke ich plötzlich, dass ich in seine Mansarde Einblick habe, wenn er das Licht einschaltet. ich sehe seine Bewegungen auch im Spiegel. Ich stehe am Fenster mit der Front zu ihm. Er spricht beim Hantieren leise vor sich hin. Das Dienstmädchen hat irgend etwas falsch oder ungeschickt hingelegt. Schliesslich sage ich leise aber mit tiefer und etwas unheimlicher Stimme: "Guten Morgen". Er erschrickt etwas und schreibt das Gehörte dann irgendwie dem Dienstmädchen zu. Dann gehet das Licht aus. Ich wundere mich erst und begreife dann, dass er nun hinausgegangen ist, weil Gisela ihn abgeholt hat zu der Tour, die sie heute am Sonntag machen wollen (320 words)

Beide hatten mich zu einem Aussprachekreis eingeladen und beide zur gleichen Zeit (um Halb-Vier). Ich schwankte lange, zu wem ich gehen sollte, und entschied mich dann für Brückner, weil ich bei ihm am längsten nicht gewesen war und Hoffmann das am besten plausibel machen konnte. Dann ging ich mit Anderen in die Kirche, wo es sein sollte. Ich schwankte aber noch beim Eingang ins Mittelschiff. Die anderen wollten schräg hinten ins Seitenschiff gehen, weil von dort hinten der Vortrag auf englisch käme. Ich beschloss, schnurgerade auf meinen alten Platz zu gehen an den Tisch, wo ich vorhin schon gesessen hatte. Es handelte sich um Träume vom Essen in Kaffees u. s. w., die vorausgegangen waren, auch ein Gemeinschaftessen, das der Kurator leitete, kam dort vor. Nach dem Essen sammelten sich seine Bekannten zwanglos, sozusagen von selbst um ihn. Ich dachte, was hat der Mann für 'nen grossen Einfluss, war aber nicht dabei. Am Ende des Traums von der Kirche Erwachen vom Weckerklingeln. - Vor allem noch ein Traum vom Gang durchs Werderholz bis zum Stadteingang. Tore wie beim Eutiner Schlosspark. (Ich sprach gestern Abend mit Beuermann von Eutin). Frage des kürzesten Weges. Breiter Waldweg voller Pfützen, die ich in grossen mühelosen Sprüngen, die grosse Lust bereiteten, vermied.

Man ist schon in einem fortgeschrittenen Stadium, in dem man die Dinge sehr sachlich nimmt. Zuweilen sieht man das Ankommen der Granatsplitter in langen feinen Bahnen vorher aufblitzen. Mein Bruder liegt neben mir und wird am rechten Zeigefinger getroffen. Aber es ist nur eine feine weisse Staubmasse, die sich um den Finger sofort am Boden bildet. Sieht aus wie weisse Schlämmkreide. Ich sage: Rausziehen. Er zieht sofort den Finger weg, und es ist nichts passiert. - Entstanden war der Angriff dadurch, dass ein Radio in einem Auto am Waldrand überhaupt angestellt wurde. Kinder hatten es getan. Ich sprach jedoch mit ihnen und hatte ihnen verboten, mit dem Auto zu spielen. Nach dem Erwachen dachte ich aber, ich hätte es getan, und wollte es darum zuerst am liebsten garnicht aufschreiben. (137 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0328 (1950-08-23 - Göttingen)Traum (Zweiter Traum) Ich wollte ein altes photokopiertes Buch abschreiben und ging dazu regelmässig in die Arbeitsräume eines grossen alten patrizischen Handelshauses. Einmal hörte ich eine Unterredung an des alten Seniorchefs mit seiner erwachsenen Tochter, die ein ausschweifendes Leben führte. Er sagte: Dann hätte ich noch eher verstanden, wenn Du zu diesem Man gegangen wärst, aber dass Du ihn in unser Haus gebracht hast, ist unmöglich. Es handelte sich um irgend einen berüchtigten Mann. Einmal, als ich nach einer kleinen Pause wieder reinkomme, höre ich, wie der Kontorvorsteher einem Mann sagt: Den Platz können Sie nicht besetzen. Da sitzt doch Herr v. Uslar. Ich bleibe halb verblüfft vor der Tür stehen. Als er mich sieht, kriege ich einen Tadel, weil ich draussen lausche. Später ist es eine Bibliothek. Gisela kommt zu mir (altes Traumthema!). Sie geht ein bisschen derb mit einem der - nein so war das nicht, sie erwartete, dass der Hausmeister ihr jederzeit eins der Bücher gibt und sagt zur Begründung: Es ist doch extra für mich von einer anderen Bibliothek hierher ausgeliehen. (Einfall: Beuermanns Buch-Abschreiben in der Bach-Ausstellung) - Später ist die Bibliothek gleichzeitig auch mein Zimmer. - Dann bin ich im Gebirge. Ein Hang wird befestigt, der sonst in der Schneeschmelze immer weggeschwemmt wird. (vgl. Thema des matschigen Weges im gestrigen Traum!) Man zieht lange hölzerne Ablaufrinnen, um das Wasser zu lenken. Dann sehe ich viele Männer und Frauen in Badehosen auf einer sonnigen Wiese sich tummeln. Eine Frau trägt nur eine Hose. Ich sehe sie, die sehr unbefangen ist, etwas verstohlen an. Dann kommt ein grosser rotbrauner Windhund und will mich beissen. Doch ich nehme es mehr wie ein Spiel, kriege dann aber doch Angst, weil er meine Hände fest zwischen den Zähnen hält. Als ich aufwache, liegt der Hund immer noch neben mir. Ich bin erstaunt und reisse die Augen auf. Es ist meine rote Bettdecke, auf die die erste Morgensonne scheint. (318 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0330 (1950-08-24 - Göttingen)Kauf von Teegebäck in einer sehr bedienungslahmen Bäckerei. Emmi, von der ich vorher schon geträumt hatte, dass sie in meiner Stube kochte, hatte mir aufgetragen, Anisplätzchen und anderes auszusuchen. Während ich dort stand, umfasste mich ein Mädchen, mit gelähmtem Unterkörper, um sich an mir hoch zu ziehen, und liess sich dann in meinen ausgestreckten Arm gleiten, so dass ich ihre Schultern umfasste und sie hinaus geleiten konnte. Sie hatte eine schöne Figur und war elegant angezogen. An der Tür holte sie ein Mann ab. Sie sagte, wenn sie keinen Stock habe, müsse sie sich stützen lassen. Das eine gelähmte Bein war sehr schmal und unbekleidet. Es war nach innen gedreht. Ich nickte ihr zu und schaute in sehr schöne blaue Augen. Dann wollte ich den Kuchenkauf beenden, doch die Bedienung war inzwischen noch nicht einen Schritt weiter gekommen. Ich sagte: Hier ist ein Saubetrieb. Ich trug einen schweren Rucksack, den ich nun ablegte. Auch zog ich meine schwarze Jacke und den blauen Rollkragenpullover aus. Doch weil ich Hosenträger trug (das ist so bei dem alten schwarzen Anzug, den ich übrigens jetzt nie mehr trage), hängte ich die Jacke wieder um. Der ganze Traum hatte übrigens damit angefangen, dass ich in meinem Bett lag und die elektrischen Schnüre auf meinem Nachttisch durcheinander gekommen waren, so dass die Geräte teilweise über mir in der Luft hingen. Dann kam Emmi und baute ihre Kochplatte auf den Nachttisch. Es war mir garnicht recht, weil ich gerade beim Essen war und das Essen nun kalt wurde. Ich nahm das anscheinend sehr wichtig. - Vor allem dem, glaube ich, waren Pferdeträume, doch kann es auch sein, dass die Erinnerung an den Film trügt, den ich gestern abend mit Gisela sah, in dem viele Pferde vorkamen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0334 (1950-08-30 - Wittmoldt)"Nägel, bei denen Spitze und Kreuz gebrochen sind", sagte ein kleines Mädchen in meinem Traum, als mein Gastgeber ein Schild mit meinem Namen an einer Tür befestigen wollte und dabei allen Nägel Kopf und Spitze abbrach. Zuletzt hängte er es an einen vorne abgebrochenen Haken. Vorher Ersteigen enger Treppen in dem kleinen Einfamilienhäuschen. Ich war eine Treppe zu hoch gestiegen. Da sass das Mädchen (vielleicht ein zwölfjähriges, in Jacke und dreiviertel langen Hosen, beide braun kariert) und nahm mit grosser Lässigkeit seine langen Beine zur Seite, damit ich die Treppe weitergehen konnte. Daraus folgte die Nägelszene. Vor dem allen schon vielfache Träume von Reisen und Gastgebern, mit Länger-Bleiben und Später-Fahren, in denen sich Göttingen und Wittmoldt, Bülows und frühere Gastgeber, Giselas Wohnung und Frau Heitmüller vielfach verquickten. Gisela gab mir noch im Wegfahren einen Rat, was ich zu Frau Heitmüller, ihrer Wirtin, sagen sollte, um noch ein paar Tage länger in der Stube hausen zu können. (156 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0335 (1950-08-31 - Wittmoldt)Ich sitze vor einem grossen Mietshaus in der Dämmerung auf dem Rasen, und sehe, wie im Treppenhaus eine Gestalt immer auf und abhuscht. Es kommt mir unheimlich vor. Da kommt auch schon die Gestalt auf mich zu, bedroht mich und beginnt, mich zu würgen. Ich erkenne ein schizophrenes Mädchen. Ich ringe lange mit ihr und bringe sie allmählich zur Ruhe. Als erstes riss sie meine Schlipsnadel mit dem gewunden Goldknoten und den zwei Perlen heraus, versuchte sie zu zerbrechen und warf sie auf den Rasen. Ganz zuletzt, als schon alles in Ordnung ist, kommt sie noch einmal wieder und sucht voll Reue nach der Nadel. (105 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0336 (1950-08-31 - Wittmoldt)Später Träume von Schriftbildern (Klages, "Handschrift und Charakter") und von einer Skelettsammlung. Auch die Abbildung einer ganzen Familie, die sich das Leben genommen hatte, weil sie sich für wahnsinnig hielt, obwohl sie nur etwas neurotisch war. (Hypochondrisches Thema, angeregt durch die medizinische Lektüre). Die Skelette waren zum Teil phantastisch ausgeführt und zeigten die Plastik des Leibes. (56 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0337 (1950-09-01 - Wittmoldt)Vielerlei Träume von Haltung, Kleidung, Tanz, vom Filmen und anderen Dingen. Es war wie eine grosse Materialsammlung dessen, was ich gerne tue. Und nach dem Erwachen habe ich das Gefühl: So findet man zu sich selbst. (36 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0338 (1950-09-01 - Wittmoldt)Abends. Bei einem Selbstgespräch über meinen Zustand nickte ich ein. Der imaginäre Partner war Gisela -- ich sitze viel in der Sonne, bade, lese und ruhe mich aus. Nur zuweilen stolpere ich über irgend eine Erinnerung wie über einen ausgespannten Faden. Hier ist ja nichts, was mich nicht an Dich erinnert und schmerzt. Aber das ist nur im ersten Moment so. Hier sind aber auch grosse Kräfte aufgespeichert, von denen ich mir Kraft hole. Ich sehe einen Hahn, der angezapft wird. Vorstellung: Im letzten Moment fuhr ich hierher, um wieder Kraft für meine Sachen zu schöpfen. Überlegung: Woher kommt diese Kraft? Ist es nur Trug der Erinnerung? Nein, es ist wirklich objektive Kraft hier aufgespeichert, zeitlos. Es liegt auch an der Landschaft. Diese Landschaft ist eben anders. Hier kam die Vorstellung eines Strudels, der das Wort anders erfasste, das als Druckbild zu sehen war. Anders, anders, anders, in ganz rhythmischer Folge. Dann wurde ich auf die Erscheinung aufmerksam und des Einschlafens inne. (162 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0339 (1950-09-02 - Wittmoldt)Lange Gespräche im Traum mit einem Dichter über seine Werke, das Alte Testament und meine Stellung zur Theologie. Bis ins Einzelste ausgeführt. Ich machte mir Notizen über die Namen der Werke und numerierte diese. Vorher Kriegssituation. Beschiessung. Wir sitzen am Fuss einer Scheune. Durch Lautsprecherpropaganda wird vom Feind eine Beschiessung bekannt gegeben. Unter anderem: "Der Tee-Club da am Fuss der Scheune wird auch bald nicht mehr sein". Wir stieben auseinander. -- Dann Stadt am Ufer eines Sees. Ich bewundere ein Blockhaus. Dann ein tiefer kellerartiger Schacht, in dem unten eine Wasserleitung läuft. Er war repariert worden, weil die Leitung nicht funktionierte. Ich gehe mit Dieter dort hin. Die Leute sind noch am Saubermachen von den Bauarbeiten. Man muss sich das so vorstellen, dass diese Quelle oder Leitung unterhalb eines Hauses liegt, das auf die Steilküste und in die Steilküste hinein gebaut ist. Es ist vielleicht mehr ein Kamin als ein Schacht. (151 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0340 (1952-09-03 - Wittmoldt)Mancherlei Träume, in denen einmal auch das Autogene Training eine Rolle spielte, doch sozusagen negativ vorgeführt: Die Kiefer wurden ganz fest aufeinander gepresst. Ich musste selbst im Traum darüber lachen. Dann das eigene Leibbewusstsein in vielerlei Abstufungen und Bildern, die mir schon im Halbwachen als solche deutlich wurden. Ich sonnte mich und badete gestern nackend und empfand das stärkere Innewerden des eigenen Körpers dabei wohltuend. Auch wurde mir zwischen diesen Träumen deutlich, wie sehr alle unsere Träume auch Leiberlebnisse sind. Man sollte solches Baden und Sonnen auch zur Heilung verwenden, denn diese Körpernähe verschafft einen Kontakt zur Realität, der vielen heilsam werden könnte. Die Hitze spannte ein Tuch um mich, aus Sonnenstrahlen gewoben, und zuletzt glitt ich wie ganz von selbst ins Wasser, das mich nahtlos umschloss. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0341 (1950-09-03 - Wittmoldt)Ein anderer Traum von meiner goldenen Uhr, jedoch nicht die, von welcher ich in Krischans Stube einmal träumte, dass ich sie aufgegessen hätte, sondern die andere, die ich früher trug und in der letzten Zeit neben meinem Bett aufhängte und die ich eigentlich Gisela mitgeben wollte und, da sie das nicht mochte, ihr versprach, beim (Aufstehen - Fehlleistung! -:) Aufziehen immer an sie zu denken. Diese Uhr überschlug im Traum zuweilen die Stunde. Zuletzt gebärdete sich der Stundenzeiger ganz eigenwillig, ging vor und rückwärts pendelnd, ganz gleichgültig gegen die Richtung der Zeit, ohne dass ich etwas daran ändern konnte. Es ist sehr reizvoll, wenn dann gegen Morgen einem solche Träume wieder einfallen und man dann plötzlich ihren Sinn errät. Jetzt fällt mir ein, dass ich dann auch von einer dritten goldenen Uhr noch träumte, die durch mehrfache Deckel verschlossen war. Das alles stand im Zusammenhang mit Mudding Schultz, also einem Menschen aus meiner Kinderzeit. Auch war die Entdeckung mehr wie ein Wiederfinden. Ebenfalls sah ich das silberne Empire-Gefäss, das meine Mutter Mudding (Emmis Mutter) schenkte und diese dann später an mich. (181 words)

Der Alligator hat vier Beine, mit Krallen bewehrte Klauen und sieht im übrigen aus wie ein Hund. Auf der Flucht vor der Schlange gerate ich vor den Alligator. Noch am letzten Ende eines Zweiges schwebend frage ich Christian, ob der Alligator mir gefährlich sei, und höre von hinten seine Antwort: "Kaum, denn jetzt ist er gerade mit dem Eichhörnchen beschäftigt". Ich lasse mich fast lautlos auf die Erde nieder, aber sofort kommen beide Tiere auf mich zu. Ich schaue scharf dem Alligator in die Augen, um ihn zu bannen, und gehe nun immer rückwärts. Er unterhält sich mit mir und gibt mir zuweilen seine Krallen-bewehrte Klaue, aber so vorsichtig, dass mir nichts passiert. Zuletzt lange ich, so rückwärts gehend, bei der Terrasse des Hauses an. Die Silberpappel hatte da gestanden, wo hier die grossen Linden an der Auffahrt stehen, und der Weg war am Ufer des Sees entlang gegangen. Nun gibt er mir zum Abschied noch einmal die Hand und vor allen Leuten kratzt er mich dabei noch ordentlich mit den Krallen. (193 words)

Als ich dort war, bekam ich eine Kamera, die aussah wie ein elektrischer Föhn, behauptete auch, alles zu können, und musste von einem hohen Gerüst aus irgend eine Szene filmen, die sehr dramatisch war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0345 (1950-09-07, 05:30 - Wittmoldt)Spaziergang mit Nicolai Hartmann. Er erzählte über seine Arbeit. Er wäre magenkrank, darum könnte er immer erst spät zu Bett gehen. (Ich hatte gestern Abend Magenschmerzen!) Das störte ihn oft bei der Arbeit. Ich wäre ja ganz gesund, ich müsse noch mehr arbeiten. Dann von einem Philosophen, der ihn sehr beeinflusst habe namens Beisinger. Später Begegnung mit Kamlah, der strahlend von einem sehr guten Philosophen Beisinger erzählte. Ich sagte ihm, was Hartmann mir eben gesagt hatte. -- Anderer Traum: Begegnung mit Herrn Rosswoge (Theaterwissenschaftler und Volontär im Filmatelier). Er sprach mich an und bestätigte mir, was ich schon durch einen Brief wusste, dass im Augenblick bei den Dreharbeiten das Zuschauen nicht möglich sei. Dann Frage, wie ich dazu gekommen sei: "Wie lange sind Sie eigentlich schon beim Wiederholen?" Ich: "Wiederholen? Wieso?" Er: "Was haben Sie denn studiert, wie lange haben Sie Sport studiert?" Ich erzähle ihm nun genau die Entwicklung meines Studienganges und, dass ich Sport nicht studiert, sondern dort nur Volkstänze gelernt hätte. Während ich noch die Semesterzahlen für die einzelnen Gebiete ausrechnete, wachte ich auf und rechnete automatisch weiter, bis ich zu dem Ergebnis kam: (187 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0347 (1950-09-08 - Wittmoldt)Sah heute im Traum einen geradezu genialen Film. Auch Gisela, die genau hinter mir sass, war immer wieder begeistert. Den Titel habe ich leider vergessen. Letzte Szene: Ein Mann, der lange mit einer Besatzung irgendwo in Afrika gelegen hat, wird im Luftschloss (Fehlleistung!) Luftschiff abgeholt. Im letzten Moment steigt er völlig erschöpft ein und sinkt im Schlaf zusammen. Als er erwacht, befindet sich der Zeppelin schon in der Luft. Man spürt das leise Schwanken der Kabine, hört ein undeutliches Durcheinanderschwirren der Stimmen, eine Frau, die von ihren Träumen spricht: "Da war plötzlich so ein Gitterberg ... . Hoffentlich tritt das alles nicht wieder ein." Andere Stimmen. Es leuchtet ihm ein: Es ist ja Krieg. Die Frau hat von einer Artilleriebeschiessung geträumt. Das Luftschiff nähert sich jetzt einer Stadt. Man sieht die Dächer ganz dicht unter sich. Es geht immer tiefer, dann wieder plötzlich hoch, so dass die ganze Szenerie schief steht. Plötzlich bemerkt er, dass das Schiff schon zwischen den Häusern in den Strassen fliegt. Warum nur? In unglaublichen Wendungen windet es sich durch. Wie wird es aus dem Schacht wieder herauskommen? Dann plötzlich steil hoch -- man sieht die Frauen, die aus dem Fenster gucken, entsetzt die Augen aufreissen. Aber es ist gut gegangen. Sofort sucht das Schiff einen neuen Schutz. Und jetzt erkennt er oben in der Luft die Geschwader feindlicher Flugzeuge. Haben sie das Luftschiff schon entdeckt? Die ganze Gefahr wird ihm bewusst. Einen Augenblick Totenstille. Man hört nur das Ticken der Uhr. Gisela flüstert hinter mir: "Fabelhaft". Ich habe Angst, die anderen Kinobesucher zu stören, aber sage dann zu ihr: "Ja, wirklich fabelhaft". Dann eine neue Szene. Man sieht den Vorraum zu einem grossen Ballsaal, durch den die Menschen in leuchtenden Kleidern strömen. Ein drahtiger, schwarzhaariger Tanzmeister zieht mit seiner Partnerin voran. Er hat etwas Zügiges in seinen Bewegungen, die unbedingt überzeugen. Ich stosse Gisela an: Den Schauspieler kenne ich, das ist der Tanzmeister, bei dem ich das Menuett gelernt habe. Von ihm dachte ich immer, dass er Giselas Tanzmeister werden könnte. Dann Erwachen: Ich höre wieder das Ticken der Uhr, die hinter mir auf dem Nachtisch steht. -- Vor diesem allen waren noch andere Traumszenen. Kofferpacken, Aufbruchsituation, knappe Zeit. Zuletzt suchte ich noch den Weg eine Treppe hinauf, der mir beschrieben war. Sie führte bald aus einem alten Fachwerkhaus nach aussen als Freitreppe, die halb im überhängenden Dach verborgen ins Grenzenlose anstieg. Man musste sich bücken, um hochsteigen zu können. Doch verband sich durch das überhängend schützende Dacht das Gefühl der Grenzenlosigkeit mit dem der schützenden Geborgenheit und dem der zügigen Führung, so wie eine Kugel durch den gezogenen Lauf fährt. Dabei hatte man das Gefühl einer steigenden Stetigkeit und des Entdeckens ferner Länder: (Dazu fällt mir ein: "Laufet -- Brüder -- Bäume -- Bahn: Die für mich eindrucksvollste Stelle aus der Neunten Symphonie). Aus dieser Szene ging der Traum vom Luftschiff dann hervor." (479 words)

Gedanke: Gisela stört es vielleicht, dass man auf der Strasse geht. -- So im Traum. Später: Das Haus wurde umgebaut. Sämtliche Treppen waren abgerissen, alle Klosetts abmontiert. (49 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0349 (1950-09-10 - Wittmoldt)Reiseträume: Ungarn, England, Tante Milly, Tante Lu (Kirchberg). Verirren in Strassen einer Stadt. Mischung aus Göttingen und Schwerin. Thema: Parallelstrassen (Nikolausberger-Weg und Willhelm-Weber-Strasse in Göttingen -- so hiessen die Strassen, aber es waren nicht Villen-Strassen wie in Göttingen, sondern Altstadtstrassen wie etwa in Schwerin "der grosse" und "kleine Moor".) Und schräge Verbindungen: Burgstrasse (Schwerin) - die dann zu weit oben mündeten. In dieser Szenerie schläfrige Verwirrung. Dolos Fahrrad, das sie mir geliehen hatte, kann ich plötzlich vor einem Haus zwischen lauter anderen Fahrrädern nicht wiederfinden. Dann Schlafszenen: Ich bin auf einer fremden Couch (wie bei Tante Lu oder Tante Milly) einfach eingeschlafen. Mühseliges Erwachen. (104 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0350 (1950-09-11 - Wittmoldt)Besuch in Wuppertal. Spaziergang mit Gisela. Zwischen Kohlenzügen. Auch das Pflaster ist mit feinem schwarzen Kohlenstaub bedeckt. Gespräch im Hausflur. Gisela sagt: "Nicht so laut. Man kann es hören". Mutter hat gesagt: "Warum schreit der eigentlich immer so? Aber man kann es ja verstehen. Ich muss ihm Speck und Schinken geben, damit er wieder gesund wird." Später Wagenfahrt mit Emmi. Ich nehme ihr die Zügel aus der Hand. Oft muss ich auf der verschneiten Strasse ganz scharfe Kurven nehmen, um niemanden zu überfahren. Das bereitet mir Lust, während es als Zuschauer mich in Angst versetzt haben würde. Ich merke, wie man beim Lenken mit dem Wagen verwächst und von ihm ein Leibgefühl bekommt. (Jaspers). Zuletzt ist es nur noch ein Handwagen, auf dem ich allein einen steilen Berg hinabrolle, während sich die Strasse immer mehr mit Fussgängern füllt. Ich versuche, möglichst viele anzurufen und zu warnen und steure so gut als möglich zwischen ihnen durch. Ein Hund sitzt mitten auf der Strasse. Rechts und links Fussgänger. Ich kann ihn nicht mehr umsteuern, wenn ich nicht Menschen überfahren will. Ich rufe laut: "Hallo, Hund!" Niemand hört mich. Er weicht nicht vom Fleck: Dann nur noch der Gedanke: er wird mich vor Schreck und Schmerz beissen. Nach dem Zusammenprall fühle ich mich völlig erschöpft. Dann kommt die Polizei. Ein weiss gekleideter Beamter ist mir entgegen gekommen. Ich sehe aber ein, dass ich im Unrecht bin, weil mein Wagen keine Bremsen hatte. Der Hund hat das Spielbein gebrochen. Es wird eine Anklage geben. Der Polizist rät: "Sie müssen das vermeiden, auf die Waage zu fahren und -- nicht schon jetzt -- aber, wenn sie auf den Hof kommen, etwas humpeln." Ich fühle mich sehr erschöpft und stütze mich auf Franz, da niemand anders mehr da ist und im Augenblick auch das mir Recht ist. (301 words)

Wir schlafen beide in einem Bett, und zwar jeder mit dem Kopf am anderen Bettende als der Andere. Gerd Grambow will mich besuchen. Er ruft unter dem Fenster. Nächste Szene: Gisela wohnt im selben Häuserblock. Sie beschreibt ihr Zimmer: Genau mir gegenüber im Geviert. Nächste Szene: Gespräch mit der Wirtin. Daraus hervorgehend: Ländliche Situation (ähnlich wie hier). Irgend etwas wird in eine Jauchegrube versenkt. Daraus hervorgehend Schützenplatz-ähnliche Situation. Die Grube nur ein Teil eines holzüberdachten Schuppens. Dort war wohl eine Versammlung. Ich werde mitgenommen. Nächste Szene: Vor dem Bahnhof einer Kleinstadt winkt mir ein Mann. Er kommt mir bekannt vor, ich laufe hin, kann mich aber nicht besinnen. Er begrüsst mich strahlend und selbstverständlich. Ich gucke ihn fragend an. Er zupft mit der Spitze seines Stockes an meinem Pullover. Ich denke, das kann nur Herr Neckelmann sein, der mir Onkel Gerds Sachen, und darunter auch einen Pullover gab. Ich gehe um ihn herum, um ihn besser zu erkennen. Er sagt: "Sie suchen wohl meine Narbe, die ist nicht mehr da. Die ist mit Gamma-Strahlen beseitigt". Nächste Szene: Feeli stapelt Kisten auf (Wieder vereint -- zugleich Kriegssituation. Munitionskisten und Verbandskisten.) Nächste Szene: Eisenbahnstrecke: ich fahre mit einem Anderen zusammen, der den Ehrgeiz hat, schneller zu sein als die Lokomotive, auf einem Art Schienenfahrrad. Gefahr. Anrollende Lokomotiven. Schnelles Absteigen. (225 words)

Der kleine Hans Jürgen kommt angelaufen, bringt Dolo eine angebrochene Tafel Schokolade und sagt: "Hier ist Ihre Schokolade." Ich bin erstaunt, dass er sie ganz von selbst zurückgebracht hat. Sie gibt ihm und mir etwas. Nächste Szene: Ich habe in jeder Hand ein dickes Stück Schokolade und kaue eifrig. Dann gehe ich auf ein Klo und Dieter sagt: "Willst Du da essen?" Es ist mir eigentlich ziemlich egal, aber ich gehe wieder heraus, zumal der Ort oben Fenster hat, durch die Dieter und Hans Kurt hereingucken können. (92 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0354 (1950-09-14 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte, meine Abreise stünde bevor. Gespräch mit Dolo, das ich mich recht nett bei Mölöchen verabschieden müsse, da es ihr im Augenblick nicht gut ginge und sie der Freundlichkeit bedürfe. Dolo sah einen Glückskäfer in meinem Haar krabbeln. Ich sagte: "Nimm ihn Dir doch!" - "Nein, der muss da bleiben", antwortete sie. Dann sah ich einen Glückskäfer von meinem Finger zu ihr über kriechen. Ich sagte: "Guck mal, da kriecht er zu Dir über". - "Oh ja", sagte sie, "da ist ja noch einer". Dann wachte ich auf, und bald darauf kam Dolo herein, um Dieter zu wecken, wie auch gestern nach meinem Traum. (105 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0356 (1950-09-16 - Wittmoldt)Brief von Gisela: "Ich bin nur noch Sonnabendnachmittag in Göttingen. Zu Dir kommen kann ich wahrscheinlich nicht, denn ich will nicht noch eine Nacht in diesem abgebrochenen Gemach bleiben. Darum habe ich gedacht, dass ich alle zu mir zum Tee einlade. Abends zum Weiterfahren holt Mutter mich dann ab. Vielleicht komme ich aber auch Montag. Du weißt, dass ich die Montag-Abende liebe. Du kannst dann also kommen, wann Du durch die Post den Tag erfährst." Ich wachte auf, unglücklich darüber, dass ich nur noch einer von allen sei: Der Satz: "Zu Dir kommen kann ich wahrscheinlich nicht" war innerhalb des Briefes eigentlich wie ein Gesprächsstückchen -- so, dass ich den Brief bis dahin las -- im Lesen die Bitte äusserte: "Dann kannst Du zu mir kommen" und dann die Antwort vernahm: "Wahrscheinlich nicht...", die eben auch so sehr enttäuschte. Interessant ist, wie hier der Brief in die Gesprächsform sich auflöst, da wir ja auch im Wachen aufregenderes in dieser Weise lesen. (161 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0357 (1950-09-16 - Wittmoldt)Gespräche bei der Tafel über einen Propheten und Weltverbesserer. Die Tür öffnet sich. Ein kleiner untersetzter Herr kommt herein, altmodisch gekleidet, mit einer Schädelform wie Oswald Spengler, aber grossen, etwas starren Augen. Er beginnt zu reden. Ich versuche, ihn zu durchschauen und seinen Blick zu fangen. Doch das ist nicht möglich und ich rufe ihm schliesslich ein "Halt" zu. Dann sehe ich Bilder an der Wand. Unter anderem eine grosse Frauengestalt ohne Kleider. Als ich mich in das Bild vertiefen will, fühle ich, wie mir von hinten ein Tuch über den Kopf geworfen wird, und ich werde fortgezogen. Dann öffnet sich das Tuch zu einem Spalt vor den Augen und ich sehe eine wilde schwarze Meergöttin nackend auf einem Pferd auf dem Rücken liegen. Ich erkenne Gisela, die mich von dem Bild fortgezogen hatte, lasse mich auf sie fallen und überdecke sie mit Küssen. Dabei scheine ich zu erwachen, aber küsse auf dem Bauch liegend weiter, was mir vorkommt, meine Arme und alle Gegenstände. Als ich mich aufrichte, sehe ich durch das Fenster draussen in der morgendlichen Dämmerung uniformierte Gestalten auf dem dünnen Eise. Sie scheinen einen Toten zu tragen. Dann erkenne ich an ihren Pelzmützen und den Schulterstücken, die sie tragen, dass es russische Offiziere sind. Die ganze Szene hatte in ihrer kristallenen Lautlosigkeit etwas von den Bildern des Napoleonischen Winterfeldzuges. Andere Männer sehe ich nackend im Wasser schwimmen. Dann hat mich einer der Russen am Fenster entdeckt und ich schütze mich hinter der Mauer, um nicht erschossen zu werden, und beschliesse, mich nun völlig anzukleiden, um allen Kriegsstrapazen gewachsen zu sein.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0359 (1950-09-19 - Wittmoldt)Ich versuchte im Traum, in einem Treppenhaus hoch zu steigen. Doch ich war wie festgewurzelt -- und zwar umso mehr, je mehr die anderen (Dieter, Hans Kurt u.a..), die oben aus der Tür guckten, mich sehen konnten. Schliesslich versuchte ich, auf dem Rücken gleitend, ihren Blicken zu entkommen, so ungefähr, wie man unter einen Tisch kriecht. (56 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0360 (1950-09-20 - Wittmoldt)Träumte heute Nacht von einer Szenerie, die nacheinander Bundestag, Befehlsstelle und Filmatelier war. Es wechselten nur die Inhalte. Die Rollen blieben die selben. So wurde aus dem Bundeskanzler der Kommandeur und aus diesem der Aufnahmeleiter. In der militärischen Szene kam ich aber in Gefahr, zusammen mit dem Stab erschossen zu werden, entwich aber in eine Tür, weil ich mich mit der Sache, um die gekämpft wurde, nicht identisch fühlte.

Ja - , aber er hoffe, dass ich meine Nummer noch sehr verbessern könne. - "Nein, das ist mir viel zu mühsam, denn ich bin jetzt nicht vorbereitet, und vielleicht wird dann die Nummer anstatt besser schlechter". -- Der Lehrer sehr enttäuscht: "Na, wenn Sie nicht wollen -- dann werde ich eben, so lange die Prüfung dauert, bis zum 2. Oktober, kein Wort mehr mit Ihnen sprechen. Ich habe überhaupt viel Komisches von Ihnen gehört. Als Sie in den Bergen waren, kannten Sie meinen Vater nicht mal mit Namen, und da haben Sie immer (den Webetanz?) gepfiffen, so dass keiner heraushören konnte, was gemeint war, und überhaupt: Sie haben angefangen, zu studieren wie alle Anderen und jetzt sind alle Anderen schon etwas geworden und Sie sind noch immer nichts."

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0363 (1950-09-23 - Wittmoldt)Auf einer Latrine. Ein Landser kommt herein -- mit weissem Käppi auf dem Kopf. Ich kenne ihn als zuverlässigen Koch. Hinter ihm seine Frau. Sie sprechen über eine Malaria, die am Ort grassiert, und geraten dabei in Streit. Schliesslich, als ich mich erhoben habe, reisst der Mann sinnlos Papier von einer Rolle, und wirft es in das Becken, bis das Wasser überfliesst. Als ich endlich -- ähnlich wie die Frau ihn davon zu überzeugen suche, dass er aufhören und zum Mindesten warten müsse, bis das Wasser abgeflossen ist, stürzt er wütend auf mich ein und packt mich an den Händen. Ich schicke die Frau fort, die nun zwischen unseren Armen steht und bleibe so ruhig, dass seine Wut in leise Verzweiflung umschlägt. Dann beruhige ich ihn, indem ich seinen Kopf an meine Schulter lege. (134 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0364 (1950-09-23 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte, ich hätte Halluzinationen gehabt und wollte sie gerade aufschreiben mit den Worten: "Kurz nach dem Erwachen erscheinen mir manchmal halluzinatorische Gestalten, Gebilde meiner Phantasie, mit denen ich mich unterhalte. Eben wollte ich einem auf den Kopf tippen, weil ich an seiner Echtheit zweifelte, und wurde dabei erst der Täuschung inne." Als ich den Satz aufschreiben wollte, merkte ich erst, dass ich noch gar nicht wach war und, als es mir gelang, die Augen zu öffnen, war das Zimmer, in dem ich lag, ganz anders als das, von dem ich geträumt hatte, und es herrschte nicht Dämmerung, sondern helles Tageslicht.

Ich hatte also das Geräusch als Farbe angesprochen. Dabei war es nicht etwa so, dass ich -- noch im Traum - etwas Blaues sah, sondern es war wirklich das Geräusch, das ich wahrnahm und das sich auch im vollen Erwachen nicht änderte, nur dass ich es nicht als Geräusch erkannte, sondern dieses Etwas für eine Farbe hielt. Darum war ich sehr entsetzt, als es dadurch nicht aufhörte, sondern seine Unheimlichkeit behielt, die drohend war. Das dauerte einen Moment, bis es mir klar wurde, dass ich etwas hörte, und dass es die Weckeruhr war. (111 words)

Ich fasste sie an, und spürte, dass ihr Gesicht sehr heiss war und fragte: "Hast Du Fieber?", und erwachte. Nach dem Erwachen klopfte es, und Dolo kam herein, um Dieter zu wecken. Ich sagte ihr: "Wie geht es Dir?" - "Gut" - "Ich habe geträumt, Du hättest Fieber" - "Das habe ich auch heute Nacht geträumt". (86 words)

Vorher träumte ich, dass die Mädchen in unserem Zimmer waren und uns massierten. Lindi sass auf Dieters Bett und Mix auf meinem. Später kam Tante Pienchen, vor der wir aber nichts verbargen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0369 (1950-09-29 - Wittmoldt)Im Botanischen Garten. Ich war über den Stacheldrahtzaun geklettert, weil draussen mich drei Hunde bedrängten (zwei zwillingsgleiche und ein anderer). Drinnen bekomme ich sofort mein Strafmandat über DM 1.50, weil es verboten ist, über den Zaun zu klettern. In zügelloser Wut zerreisse ich das Papier und was sonst an Post auf dem Tisch liegt. Ein Brief ist dabei, den ich nicht sofort kaputtkriege. Da sagt Emmi, deren Blick auf die Adresse fällt, da steht von Oertzen-Roggow drauf (das "Falkenau" des Webetanzes.). Zweiter Traum: Ich will in das Haus des Gärtners (Wittmoldt) eindringen. Da fällt mich ein Hund an. Es gelingt mir noch, ihm einen Knüppel ins Gebiss zu stecken, doch versucht er, den Kopf so zur Seite zur drehen, dass er auch noch meine Finger in den Biss bekommt. Als ihm das schon fast gelungen ist, rufe ich laut um Hilfe. Der herbeikommende Schweizer Ivan, ein Pole, der mich immer an den Ballettmeister Krischan aus den "Roten Schuhen" erinnert sagt, ich solle ganz ruhig den Hund auf die Fensterbank setzen, dann werde er mich nicht wieder anspringen. Ich tue es, es gelingt, und ich erwache. (185 words)

Kriegstraum: Ich bin irgendwo völlig allein, mit einem Radio und in zivilen Umständen, und soll eine Stellung verteidigen. Es hat aber gar keinen Sinn, Hilfe anzufordern, weil auch dort, wo man den Befehl erteilt hat, keine Truppen mehr entbehrt werden können. Ich überlege, ob ich schiessen solle, um den Eindruck von Macht zu erwecken, oder ob ich schweigen solle, um den Feind nicht auf mich aufmerksam zu machen.

Ich warte dort eine Weile, während er und der Geschäftsmann etwas holen, und höre inzwischen eine Geschichte so vor mich hin, die in diesem Tonfall erzählt wird. Währenddessen hantiert eine alte Frau auf dem Flur, auf dem ich stehe. Später kommt der Mann alleine wieder, und ehe wir die geschäftlichen Angelegenheiten erledigen, erzähle ich ihm meine merkwürdig gehörte Geschichte. Es ist die Geschichte eines Pfluges, den ein junger Bauer besitzt und in den ein alter Mann sich verliebt hat und ihn nun auf jede Art und Weise zu bekommen sucht.

Dazu hatte sie auf einmal rabenschwarze Haare und eine gelblich braune Haut. Sie wollte es nicht anders aufsetzen. Ich war verzweifelt und schliesslich riss ich es ihr vom Kopf. Dann wiederholte sich die Traumszene noch einmal sozusagen variiert: Es war gleichzeitig ein Heimkehrer aus der Gefangenschaft, ein Offizier, Ernst Jünger. Diesmal hatte er eine Schirmmütze auf. Es stand zur Debatte, ob ein Soldat diese erworbene Starre ablegen dürfe. Dabei stand er wie vor einer Tür oder Spalte, vor der ein Pendel hin und her schwankt. Dranghaftes Erwachen. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0393 (1950-10-11 - Horst)Dann Träume von N.N. Sie war bei einem Luftangriff ums Leben gekommen. Ich ging noch während des Angriffs durch die Strassen bis zu einer katholischen Kirche, in der zwei sargartige Tragbahren aufgestellt waren, in deren einer N.N. lag. Ausser mir waren auch noch einige Jungen in der Kirche. Einer von ihnen öffnete neugierig diesen Sarg, den ich bewachte. Der war drinnen mit Krepp-artigen Papier gefüllt, in das die Tote gepackt war. Es war schon etwas vom Blute verklebt und rot gefleckt. Er hob, während ich hineinschaute, die Packung vorne etwas an und die Haut der Stirn mit dem Haaransatz wurde sichtbar. Mich schauderte bei diesem Anblick, der mich doch eigenartig berührte. Dann deckte er alles wieder zu, stopfte das Papier zurecht, und trat, da es nicht reinging, es mit dem Fuss zusammen. Ich bat ihn vorsichtig zu sein. Er sagte, die Angehörigen würden den Sarg doch nicht mehr öffnen. Ich antwortete: "Würdest Du es gerne sehen, wenn die, die Du geliebt hast, auf den Kopf getreten wird?" Er lachte und es gab eine Schlägerei, bei der mich aber mehr die körperliche Leidenschaft als die Kampfwut überkam. In einer anderen Szene hatte ich eine kleine Handorgel, die N.N.'s Eltern, wohl für die Beerdigung, geschickt hatten und die Emmi mir gab. Sie hatte vorne und hinten Tasten und ich spielte zunächst einige Töne darauf, die auf Emmi nur störend wirkten, weil sie keine Melodie ergaben. Dann untersuchte ich das ganze Instrument. Es hatte in seinem Unterbau viele flache Fächer, wie man sie an Nähkästen kennt. Darin waren Grammophonnadeln, X-Hacken und anderes, sorgfältig geordnet. Schliesslich drehte ich das Instrument um und tippte auf die hinteren Tasten, während ich von ferne sehr schöne andere Musik hörte. Die Tasten hatten nur einen ganz geringen Hubraum, als wären sie festgelegt und gaben nur bezaubernde kleine Silbertöne, wie die obersten Tasten eines Cembalo. Ich tippte nur gleichsam wahllos die Tasten an, und sie gaben immer eine wunderbare Begleitung zu der Musik, die ich von ferne hörte. Ich gewann das Instrument sehr lieb und überlegte, ob ich es N.N's Eltern zurückgeben müsse, die es sicher längst vergessen hatten, oder es auch gar nicht zurückhaben wollten. (357 words)

Der Traum ging hervor aus einer Szene mit mehreren Personen, die miteinander klönten und diskutierten. - Anderer Traum: Mit Emmi. Betrachten eines Gemäldes. Zunächst ein wildes Farbendurcheinander. Emmi sagt: "Was soll das Bild überhaupt?" Ich sage: "Oh, da ist ja ein Tiger, ein Tiger in einem Urwald. " Dann sehe ich das Bild plötzlich anders. Die Kapitelle eines klassischen Gemachs. Die anderen Linien kann man nur erraten. Dann wird plötzlich alles immer sicherer. Das Bild springt mir überragender Deutlichkeit heraus (in klarem, glattem Marmor). Einzelne Farbstriche und Kleckse wie vorher sind überhaupt nicht mehr festzustellen. Eine wunderbare gegliederte Wand des Gemachs mit zwei grossen Flügeltüren, die noch geschlossen sind (ähnlich der Göttinger Aula, aber schöner).

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0396 (1950-10-13 - Horst)Ein Traum vor dem Erwachen: Ich las einen Brief von Gisela, doch konnte ich seine Schrift immer nur für Augenblicke erfassen. Dann entschwand sie mir und verwischte sich. Es begann mit den Worten "mein Geliebter". Doch sah ich nachher andere Worte an dieser Stelle. Das periodische Entschwinden liess mich nur Bruchstücke der Sätze erfassen. Hans Kurt, der im Hintergrund der Stube stand, versuchte mich zu stören und abzulenken. Ich versuchte, mich umso mehr ungespannt und ruhig auf den Brief zu konzentrieren. So wurde das Lesen zu einer Art Sport. Es leuchtete mir ein, dass es sich nur um ein Traumbild handelte, doch suchte ich so viel wie möglich zu erfassen. Ich entsinne mich noch des Wortes "Homburg". (117 words)

Dann erzählte sie mir umständlich, wo sie wohnte (Bebelstrasse 37, oder Merkelstrasse 1, es war ein Eckhaus). Sie erzählte von ihren anderen Freunden, und es war alles ganz natürlich. Es war halt ein Mädchen, mit dem man über alles sprechen konnte.

Den mir Sympathischsten lasse ich bis zuletzt. Er setzt sich an meine Bettkante, und wir sprechen noch eine Weile über irgend einen Namensvetter. Da hören wir plötzlich draussen ein Geräusch von vorbeifahrenden Autos und Sirenen. Krieg. Die Russen. Ich will aufstehen. Er drückt meine Füsse nieder: "Ruhig" und lauscht. Ich flüstere: "Anziehen".

Dann von Gisela, mit der ich sehr glücklich war, doch verlor ich sie an einem Bahnübergang. Ich versuchte später vergeblich, nach ihr zu pfeifen, da ich keinen Ton herausbrachte. Dann träumte ich von Margund, die mir von einem Freund erzählte, dessen Äusserungen mir nicht behagten. So trennte ich mich schweren Herzens mit den Worten: "Ich geb Dich frei". - Gleichzeitig war es unsere Emmi. Sie rief mich später wieder, und ich folgte ihr in das Dunkle, wobei ich fast nur schwebend lief, ohne den Boden zu berühren, ausser bei einigen wenigen Absprüngen. Ich konnte den Freund im Dunklen nicht sehen. Er drückte mir nur sehr fest die Hand. Vorher hatte ich mich noch mit einem Jungen geschlagen, der mir im Wege stand und frech wurde.

Als wir am Ende der Nebenstrassen uns trennen, sage ich ihm, bei nächster Gelegenheit solle er berichtigen, es sei durchaus nicht "aus", auch wenn ich in Philosophie promoviere und auch wenn ich nicht der kirchlichen dogmatischen Überzeugung sei -- aber das sei auch wieder missverständlich, ich sei nicht etwa antidogmatisch. Dann musste ich noch durch eine Tür gehen, vor der ein Schäferhund stand, dem ich schon vorsorglich ein lautes "Ruhig" zurief, der dann mit mir durch die Tür ging und draussen mit einem anderen Hund spielte, während ein Junge und ein Mädchen direkt und unbekümmert dabeistanden.

Der Augenblick des Erwachens ist dann ein Augenblick äusserster Entspannung. Nicht nur als Befreiung von Gefahr sondern als Befreiung von Schuld empfunden. Ich hatte mich sekundär und fast unwissend an einem Messingdiebstahl beteiligt. Ich wurde von der Polizei ausgefragt, aber so, dass ich ohne direkt etwas falsches zu sagen, doch über alles was ich wusste, nichts auszusagen brauchte und so auch meine kleine Ungenauigkeit verschweigen konnte. Doch jedesmal, wenn ich an dem kleinem Laden vorbeikam, der dem Dieb gehörte, und jedesmal, wenn ich das Wort Messing hörte, schlug mein Gewissen. Schliesslich merkte es mein Bruder. Er fragte mich, warum ich immer so unruhig sei, und mit der Überlegung, ob ich es ihm sagen und damit auch ihn noch in Gewissenskonflikte bringen sollte, und mit dem Wunsch, lieber standhaft zu sein, wachte ich auf.

Er fährt unter dem Bett hervor und bellt so laut wie ein Schäferhund. Davon Erwachen. -- 3. Ich will das Fenster mit einer Decke zuhängen. Im selben Moment höre ich Herrn von Ebens Stimme, nehme die Decke weg und ziehe den freundlich lächelnden alten Herrn herein. Bei dieser Bewegung Erwachen. Ich ziehe gerade die Beine zurück, weil mein Plumeau mir auf die Füsse fällt. (130 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0428 (1950-11-07, 05:00 - Freiburg)[in Giselas Stube.] Gespräche mit Gogarten über Verantwortung, Schuld, Verbrechen und Schuldlosigkeit: "Was man tut, indem man dem andern klar in die Augen sieht (vorausgesetzt, dies geschieht nicht im Krampf), ist eigentlich kein Verbrechen." Beispiel: Die Gegensätze: Berührung und Vergewaltigung; Mord und Kampf. Gogarten vertrat eine etwas andere Meinung, die mehr die Objektivität der Schuld sah, indem wir alles, was wir getan haben, auch selber sind. Er brauchte - in dem Traum - das Bild einer Schwebebahn: Wir sind die Pfeiler, sind die Rollen, über die alles hinwegrollt, sind zugleich aber auch alles, das, was jeweils über uns hinwegrollt, das wir tun, das geschieht. So wenigstens verstand ich sein Bild. Das Gespräch war noch sehr im Keime angelegt, bestand erst in wenigen Thesen, und Erwiderungen und musste noch ausgefochten werden, als ich erwachte. Das Bild der Schwebebahn war etwa so: Pfeiler. Querbalken mit Rollen, über die die Seile laufen, an welchen die Bahnen hängen. Eine psychologische Zwischenbemerkung, die Gogarten machte: "Sie haben mehr Ideen, ich habe weniger, aber Sie verknüpfen sie nicht genügend." Meine Erwiderung schon im Erwachen: "Das ist ganz natürlich, ich habe keine systematische Veranlagung. Man sieht es an der Schrift. Sie ist zerstückelt, wenig verknüpft".- Das ganze Gespräch hatte sich aus einer anderen Traumserie entwickelt, in der sich die Hauptfigur erst allmählich zur Gestalt Gogartens ausformte: Zuerst Kriegssituation. Überlegung, ob man vor den Russen fliehen solle. Gespräche wohl mit Krischan darüber - dann Übergang in Ausbildungs- und Garnisonssituation. Zuerst nachts. Schlafen im Stroh auf einer Scheunendiele. Vier, fünf Mann, die sich in zwei Parteien trennen, weil sie sich nicht vertragen können. Ich überlege, ob man eine Versöhnung versuchen solle. Eine Art Familiensituation, mit leisen in der Veranlagung begründeten Gegensätzen. Die Gestalt meiner Schwester spielt herein. Dann Heimkehr von der Übung in einen ständigen Standort. Dort bin ich Zeuge, wie der Feldwebel einem Mann Vorhaltungen macht, der nachts zu seinem Mädchen gegangen ist. Er habe nicht richtig, habe verbrecherisch gehandelt. Die Einzelheiten habe ich vergessen (wie immer die Quellpunkte des Traums am schnellsten verdeckt werden). Hieraus entspannt sich dann das Gespräch mit Gogarten, der darin übrigens nicht nur sich selbst sondern mehr die Geisteshaltung der Existenzphilosophie verkörperte. (356 words)

Bille sagt, die Sachen gingen auf ihre Kosten und gehörten teilweise ihr. Sie würde 2 Mark 70 dafür bezahlen müssen. Der Mann öffnet trotzdem das Paket indem er die Schnüre abstreift. Ich sage: "Es ist schade, was sie da tun, denn sie verderben durch dies Misstrauen den guten Ruf ihres Geschäftes. Sie verdächtigen sie, gelogen zu haben." Er antwortet: "Ja, das wissen wir vom ersten Moment an, dass sie das tut." Das Paket ist geöffnet. Anzüge kommen zum Vorschein, ein Mantel, eine Reithose. Bille sagt bei einigen Sachen: "Das ist von meinem Mann". Der Mantel und die Hose bleiben als Besitz des Geschäftes übrig. Darüber zeigen sich einige Konservendosen. "Das alles soll bloss 2 Mark 70 kosten?", sagt der Mann. Ich streichle Bille die Hand, die sehr verzweifelt ist. (192 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0443 (1950-11-29 - Freiburg)Die Kaiserin ist todkrank und liegt im Sterben. Ich komme zufällig mit Mutti in das Knesebecksche Haus, wo sie sich noch der Blumen annahm, wenn ihr Zustand sich zuweilen besserte. Zunächst bleibe ich im Hintergrund zurück, trete dann allmählich näher, bis an das Krankenbett. Während wir weniges sprechen, schaue ich der Kranken in die Augen, die fast zur Unkenntlichkeit verschleiert und gebrochen sind und sich immer wieder für kurze Augenblicke zu leuchtender Klarheit sammeln. Wir geben ihr Rotwein zu trinken, und während sich ihre Kräfte noch einmal sammeln, spürt sie ein Bedürfnis nach Bewegung, bei der ich innerlich mitgehe. Dabei verwandelt sich die Traumfigur teilweise in die Gestalt eines kleinen Mädchens, dessen rhythmische Bewegung an Gehversuche erinnert, die ich mit ihm ausführe. Schliesslich kommt mein Vater zu Pferde heim. Ich berichte ihm. Der Gestalt der Sterbenden ist jetzt als dritte Facette die Figur der Gattin und Mutter angeschliffen. Vater gibt ihr noch einmal etwas Rotwein zu trinken und beginnt dann einen Ausritt, bei dem ich ihn begleiten möchte. Die Kranke hat allmählich wieder ganz die Gestalt eines Kindes angenommen, doch ist dieser Gestaltwandel nicht im Traum von mir bemerkt, sondern nachträglich in der Besinnung konstatiert. Zuletzt wird das Mädchen, dessen Krankheits-Zustand nicht mehr so bedenklich scheint, gleichzeitig mit einem kleinen Jungen, der aber ganz gesund ist, zu Bett gebracht - in Etagenbetten, die mit einer Klappe geschlossen werden sie werden da gleichsam wie in einem Mechanismus hineingeschoben - wie in einen Backofen oder irgendeinem anderen - nicht gefährlichen - Apparat.

Die Brezel zertrat es, das derbere, den Gummiball hat es mit nach Hause genommen, weil er so leidenschaftlich sprang. Dann von Iwand, der seine Vorlesung so oft ausfallen liess, dass ein Anderer sie weiter führte, doch nahm Iwand sie wieder auf und jeder spann sie dann auf seine Weise weiter.

Ich versuche, ihn nicht mehr aus meinem Blick zu entlassen und ziehe mich langsam durch die Tür zurück, nachdem die Kinder fort sind. Dann schliesse ich schnell die Tür zu, laufe über den Flur in das Kinderzimmer, das Glastüren zu den anderen Räumen hat, durch welche ich den Hund nun laufen sehe, und verschliesse auch diesen Zugang. Der Hund hat nun noch eine Zimmerflucht von drei Zimmern zur Verfügung, doch kann er in das Kinderzimmer nicht hinein. - Zweite Szene: Beim Essen in diesem Raum Gespräche über Psychoanalyse. Über die Quellen meines Wissens befragt, gebe ich unter anderem auch die Autoanalyse an. Bedenkliche Gesichter. - Dritte Szene: Gefangenschaft. Transport in einer Art Strassenbahn. Hier setzt sich die Gesprächsszene fort. Ein Russe aus dem Mannschaftsdienstgrade beginnt, im Spiel mich zu untersuchen. Als er aber mit dem Finger mir in den Hals fährt, um den Kehlkopf zu prüfen, halte ich seine Hand fest, weil er kein Arzt ist und ich ihn für ungeschickt halte. Er wird sehr böse. Wir geraten in eine Debatte, bei der wir beide die Hilfe eines anwesenden Leutnants (russischen) anrufen. Der findet die Sache sehr komisch und erzählt, dass schon einer seiner Gefangenen, namens Ferber, sich in ebensolcher Situation ebenso verhalten habe. Während des Gesprächs führen mir die Soldaten in den Arm eine Spritze ein, offenbar zur Beruhigung, was sie wohl für nötig halten.

In einem elektrischen Kocher werden irgendwelche Flüssigkeiten gekocht, eine Mischung aus Wasser, Milch und Brotbrocken - oder ähnlich - in drei schmalen Gefässen, wie Trinkgläser, die nebeneinander im Kocher stehen. Sie kochen dann über und das Übergekochte schwimmt im Kocher herum. Onkel Adolf berührt es unangenehm, dass während meines Gesprächs mit Kühnel das Radio spielt, während doch Vater so kurz vor dem Tode ist. Mir ist das alles egal, ich halte es für nebensächlich, formal. Kühnel spricht mit mir über die Möglichkeit einer Rente aus dem Waisenhaus.

Ich fürchte, ich werde die Orientierung verlieren, weil ich keinen Kompass habe.- Dann in einem Raum der Universität, in dem gleich ein Kolloquium stattfinden soll, zu dem ich mich aber nicht gemeldet habe. Man sagt mir, wenn ich noch rausgehen wolle, müsse ich mich beeilen, da das Kolloquium gleich beginne. Die Antipoden des Gespräches sind ein genialischer Typ mit langen Haaren (wie Rheindell) und ein gewissenhafter (wie Wittram). Irgendein mir bekannter Professor kommt in den Raum, doch weiss nicht, ob er eigentlich zu dem Kolloquium gehört oder nicht. Er hat es vergessen. Man nimmt ihn freundlich auf und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass man ja auch improvisieren könne. Nächste Szene: Ich gehe mit der kleinen Sibylla nach Hause. Der kürzeste Weg geht durch schmale Gassen, die auf dem Münsterplatz münden. Dazwischen muss man einmal quer durchs Münster gehen. Wir irren beim Überqueren des Platzes aber seitlich ab. Sibylla sieht die Reklame einer Zeitung 4711 und strebt ohne jede Rücksicht auf den Strassenverkehr starr und steif auf sie zu. Ich kann sie kaum davon abhalten, geradewegs in das nächste Auto zu rennen, muss sie schliesslich schlagen, und es gibt Tränen. Als wir endlich den Bürgersteig erreicht haben, fragt eine Frau, was denn der Kummer wäre. Sibylla jammert nach der Zeitung 4711.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0468 (1950-12-27 - München)Gespräche mit Jünger über Hitler und mit Franz über Gisela. Es ist erstaunlich, wie man im Traum Möglichkeiten durchprobiert, auf die man im Wachen nie verfallen wird. So vertrat Jünger hier eine andere und viel freiere und positivere Ansicht über Hitler als die zeitübliche. Das Gespräch wurde in grosser Gelassenheit geführt und durch lange Blickpausen unterbrochen. Das Gespräch mit Franz entwickelte sich aus einigen Bemerkungen über einen Mann, der sich von seiner Frau scheiden lassen wollte ohne Angabe des Grundes, nur weil er ihrer überdrüssig sei. Ich vertrat die These, dass dann eine andere Frau dahinter stehen müsse, und entwickelte die Theorie der Übertragung, über die ich länger sprach, wobei ich mich in mich selbst abkapselte und in die Anschauung dieser Zusammenhänge vertiefte. Franz, der aufmerksam zugehört hatte, erwiderte, das sei alles wie eine Theorie von oben her und die Tatsachen schienen ihm anders zu sprechen. Ich war erstaunt, wie wenig er diese Zusammenhänge sehen konnte, war aber doch durch das Gespräch in einen solchen Kontakt mit ihm gekommen, dass wir nun von selbst auf Gisela zu sprechen kamen. Er sprach von dem Acht-Tage-Termin, einem Begriff aus dem Hundertjährigen Kalender, den ich nicht kannte. Er meinte damit, dass in einer Periodizität von ungefähr acht Tagen eine stärkere Annäherung zwischen mir und Gisela stattfände, wie er sie sehr wohl gemerkt habe. Während unseres Gespräches wurde es dunkler, und ich versank in eine Art hypnotischen Zustand, in dem ich einen körperlichen Kontakt zu Franz bekam, über den ich mich selbst sehr wunderte, da ich daneben immer noch die leibliche Abneigung äussersten Hasses verspürte. Doch kam auch er mir darin entgegen und so kam es, dass ich, schon halb im Schlaf, die Haut seines Armes mit leisem Küssen berührte. In der nächsten Szene ging ich in ein grosses burgartiges Haus, in welchem Schwestern pflegten und in dem Gisela im Bett lag, und erwachte bei dem Unternehmen, Franz durchs Fenster zu rufen, nachdem ich festgestellt hatte, dass Gisela nicht schlief. Ich überlegte schon im Erwachen, dass ich dazu das Beethoven Konzert pfeifen wollte, und glitt dann in die Reflexion über, dass in diesem Thema, das Franz stets vor Giselas Fenster gepfiffen hat, sich äusserster Hass mit äusserster Liebe in mir berühren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0481 (1951-01-09 - München)Im Schuhgeschäft. Neue Wildlederschuhe, in die ich mit nackten Füssen hineinfahre. Tanz mit Gisela.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0482 (1951-01-10 - München)Spaziergang mit Emmi. Gespräche über Sorgfalt und Grosszügigkeit. Ich werfe ihr vor, beim Abwaschen die Glasur von den Tellern durch Unachtsamkeit angekratzt zu haben. Verschiedenheiten der gesamten Weltauffassung schimmern bei der verschiedenen Behandlungsart der Dinge durch, Unterschiede moralischer und ästhetischer Behandlung. Reinigung und Polituren. Dann werde ich von einem Schäferhunde angefallen. Ich erkenne das sofort als Traumbild, mache zunächst Autogenes Training, um die Angst zu dämpfen, und beschliesse dann, den Hund so lange mit dem Kopf gegen eine Mauer zu schlagen, bis das Traumbild zerstört ist. Doch gelingt mir nicht sogleich das Erwachen, und mich erschreckt die Brutalität meines Vorgehens, da aller Schein der Wirklichkeit gegen mich spricht. Ich habe gegenüber den Strassenpassanten das geheimnisvolle Gefühl eines Mannes, der die Wirklichkeit anbohrt, um dahinter auf die eigentliche Realität zu stossen, bei alledem habe ich das Maul des Hundes fest geschlossen und werfe das ganze Gewicht meines Körpers hinter jedem Rammstoss an die Mauer bis zum Erwachen.

In einer Ruhepause entdeckt mich der grosse junge Schäferhund, stürmt auf mich zu und liebkost mich mit offenem Maul im Gesicht. Ich lasse alles geschehen, obwohl ich weiss, dass der Hund sonst an der Kette liegt und gefährlich ist. Habe auch keine Furcht, da die Müdigkeit alle Spannungen gelockert hat. (73 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0484 (1951-01-13 - München)Allerlei Träume. Gespräch mit Baumgarten. Blick aus seinem Fenster auf spitze, schneebedeckte Berge (Alpenlandschaft anstatt des Schwarzwaldpanoramas, das man aus seinem Fenster in Wirklichkeit sieht). -- Brief mit verwirrender Adresse, vielfach nachgeschickt. Besuch bei meinem gefallenen Freund Jürgen Wächter. -- Tanz mit meiner Schwester. An der Haustür in Freiburg. Alle Namensschilder sind abgerissen. Alles soll neu beschriftet werden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0485 (1951-01-14 - München)Träume von Plessner. Dann von meiner Schwester. Ich hörte sie in ihrem Bett weinen, stand auf und ging zu ihr, um sie zu trösten. "So kannst du da nicht sitzen, es ist zu kalt", sagte sie, als ich bei ihr auf der Bettkante sass, "dann musst du schon reinkommen". Dann kroch ich zu ihr ins Bett. Doch nach einer Weile hörte ich draussen Schritte und sprang heraus, um niemand Anstoss zu geben, und lief zu meinem eigenen Bett zurück. (79 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0486 (1951-01-18 - Freiburg)Träume von Ernst Jünger. Sehr vergnügt und ausgelassen. Er schneidet Figuren aus einem Papier von sehr verwegener Gestalt. Dazu raffinierte Waffen. Ein Schwert, dass aus dem Bild einer Klinge von Stahl zurechtgestutzt wird. Er geht dabei so vor, dass er das Bein einer Frau, die auf dem selben Bilde abgebildet war, mit seiner Schere nicht ausschneidet. Ich spürte, wie mit wenigen Schnitten unfehlbar die Konzeption heraussprang. (66 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0487 (1951-01-18 - Freiburg)Vorher anderer Traum von Jünger: Abschied von Speidel, der nach Paris fährt. Jünger schon halb uniformiert, mit einem Käppi, wie es Offiziere an der Front tragen, bleibt zurück. Davor Fahrt zu ihm, in einer Strassenbahn -- über die Ludwigstrasse in München. Davor Durchfahrt durch einsturzgefährliche Gebäude (ähnlich den Propyläen am Königlichen Platz) in denen die Strassenbahn schliesslich stecken bleibt. Ich steige aus und gehe zu Fuss. (Ähnlichkeit mit dem Traum von der Säulenkirche vor zwei Jahren! -- Traum 69). Eigentlich war es eine Fahrt von einem Hause Heideggers zu einem anderen, denn das zweite sollte vom Wohnungsamt beschlagnahmt werden, obwohl er dort seine Vorträge halten wollte. (106 words)

Während des Zuschauens las ich in einer Mappe mit Gedichtentwürfen Giselas. Zuletzt sprang ich eine Treppe hoch in mein Zimmer. Die letzten Stufen legte ich nackt zurück. Räumlichkeit und Atmosphäre dieses Traums enthielten ausser der Tanzschule die Musikhochschule und die Kunstakademie. Die vorkommenden Personen stammen teilweise aus der Wittmoldter Umgebung. Auch ein Schuss aus dem Geist der roten Schuhe war dem Ganzen untermischt. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0492 (1951-01-27 - Freiburg)Ich kam aus Wittmoldt und war nur mit einem ganz leichten Hemd bekleidet, das aber ungeschickt geschnitten war. Auf meinem Spaziergang nun versuchte ich, von hinten an den Hof heranzukommen. Ich trat durch ein grosses Tor in einen Park ein und ging meinem Gefühl nach in der Richtung dem Hof zu. Doch musste ich über eine kleine Landbrücke zwischen zwei Teichen, auf der ein Kettenhund schlief. Ich versuchte, mich ganz am Rande entlangzudrücken, doch der Hund erwachte. Es war mein Glück, dass er in seine Kette noch verwickelt war, die sich mehrfach um den Bauch geschlungen hatte. Ich strebte auf dem kürzesten Weg aus der Gefahrenzone fort und spürte sehr bald den Hund mir auf den Fersen, dessen Kette endlos zu sein schien. Schliesslich sah ich mich ins Wasser gedrängt, in das ich mit einem leisen Ekel hinein trat, weil es von Landgewächsen und Grünem erfüllt war. Ich bewegte meine Füsse in einer halb gehenden, halb schwimmenden Bewegung, während ich den Hund dicht hinter mir an seiner Kette schwimmen sah und hörte. Kurz bevor ich an das Land trat und erwachte, merkte ich, dass seine Kette aufgebraucht war, und er begann zu bellen. (193 words)

Ich trat in ihr noch halbdunkles Zimmer ein, in dem eine warme und unendlich wohlige Atmosphäre herrschte. Sie drehte sich auf die andere Seite und reckte sich im Schlaf, so das ein Fuss unter der Bettdecke herausfuhr. Erwachen. (85 words)

Ich war damit beschäftigt, alle Fenster vor ihm zu schliessen. Doch konnte ich das immer erst im letzten Moment bewältigen. So stürzte ich von Fenster zu Fenster, um das Krokodil auszusperren.

Sie leben in straffer Familienzucht, haben aber alle Freiheiten, zum Beispiel Autofahren. Die ganz kleinen lassen sich spazierenfahren. Alle diese Ordnungen blitzen nur auf an einem kleinen Genrebild, wo ein kleiner Junge und ein kleines Mädchen eine Kellertreppe runtersteigen, um ein Spiel zu holen. Das Ganze ist zwar in die Ebneter Familie projiziert, spielt aber offensichtlich eine Generation früher, wo es wirklich die vielen Jungen und ein Mädchen gab. Der Traum gleichzeitig eine Art Erzählung von Elisabeth Baumgarten. (96 words)

Ich sagte: vielleicht, ich wisse es nicht, es könne auch sein, dass ich ähnliche Bilder nur in einer Illustrierten gesehen habe. Die beschäftigten mich dann so sehr, als ob ich einen Film gesehen habe. Er: Was für eine schöne Gabe! -- Ich: Ja, ich bin etwas eidetisch veranlagt. -- Ich beschloss, solche Bilder zu sammeln, um später Filmaufnahmen nach ihnen zu machen.

Die ländliche Orientierung hat etwas ganz anderes an sich als die städtische. Die Namen, die man sich einzuprägen hat, sind nicht aus der Geschichte genommen, wie die Strassennamen der Städte, sondern es sind Namen von lebenden Menschen, die jeweils in einer Kate wohnen, einen Acker besitzen.

Eins der Mädchen, die mit mir an den Wänden lehnen, sagt mir etwas Gutes zum Webetanz und strahlt mich dabei an.

Ich dämpfe die aufsteigende innere Verzweiflung und Trauer, in dem ich in einem grossen Schaukelstuhl zurückgelehnt im Rhythmus der inneren Bewegung hin und her schaukele. -- aus dem hinteren Tiefpunkt, der zugleich ein Höhepunkt der inneren Leidenschaft ist, welche ja im Sich-Fallen-Lassen wächst, rufe ich den Kopf zurücklegend meinen Freund zu. mit den Armen auf die anderen weisend: "Sind das alle deine Brüder?".

Ich schwimme mit einem Boot auf dem See. Ich will auf einen anderen See übersetzen. Es gibt keinen Verbindungskanal und es ist schon Abend. Ich trage das Boot über eine Landenge. Schleifen kann ich es nicht, weil dann die Wiese geschädigt wird -- und oben über einem Hange steht ein Polizist. Eine Herde. Kuh mit Kälbern. Fruchtbarkeit. -- Plötzlich ein Stier. Ich weiche auf den Hang zurück, will ihm das Boot vor die Füsse werfen. Hier geht das Bildhafte des Traums in das Gehörhafte einer Geschichte über, die ich in einem Buch Ernst Jüngers lese. So lange der Stier nicht wagt, das ihm unbekannte Gelände eines steilen Hanges zu betreten, ist man in Sicherheit. Hat er den Sprung getan, ist man unweigerlich verloren, weil er viel schneller ist. -- Ein wenig weiter, am Rande einer Strasse, liegt ein Mädchen in seinem Blut, aus dem die Zwillinge ausgetreten sind, die sie empfangen hat.

Ich formulierte meine Achtung für Klopstock, der hohe Dimensionen des Sternraums in Worte gefasst habe. Heiss stellte Rilke dagegen. Er sprach in Symbolen, indem er Gläser auf den Tisch stellte, einen Römer, um den er runde und bäuerlich hölzerne Symbole gruppierte -- "dies alles muss den andeuten -- diesen Lebensweg", sagte er -- und dann ein ohne Bauchung geöffnetes Glas, das wohl den wenig erdigen, den Menschen von geringerem Format darstellte. Während wir noch sprachen, wobei ich vor einer kleinen Kiste, auf der alles aufgebaut war, kniete, kam ein alter Mann herein mit einer Blume, die wie ein abgeblautes Veilchen war, zugleich nur eine geöffnete unter vielen Knospen, die in einer Traube wie eine Taubnessel angeordnet waren. Er hatte alle anderen nicht als Blüten erkannt. Mich zog er am Rock zu sich in die Ecke, um mir die Blüten zu zeigen und mich nach ihrem Namen zu fragen.

Nachts vier Uhr. -- Ich bin in einer neu ausgebauten, im Ausbau befindlichen Art Felsenwohnung, eher wie ein Schloss oder Palast, wo in einem Raum in die natürliche Spalte eines Felsens Strom- und Gasleitung verlegt werden. Die Elektriker haben bereits sich mit der Stromleitung befasst. Plessner ist für die Verlegung der Gasleitung zuständig. Einer der Arbeiter hat bereits als Vorarbeit einen Schlauch durch die sehr gewundene Spalte gezwängt. Die Elektriker im Nachbarraum hört man laut schimpfen: Er hätte damit den Stein und ihre Arbeit gefährdet. Ich öffne die Türe und mahne sie zur Ruhe. Der Mann sei zwar nicht da -- aber wäre er da gewesen, würde er das alles gehört haben. Während dem sieht man durchs Fenster draussen Plessner auf- und ab gehen mit Regenmantel und Hut. Er steht vor einem Gedenkstein und liest die eingehauene Schrift, in dem er mit dem Finger darin langfährt. Ich denke: Ein hoch-taktiler Mensch, der ein ursprüngliches Verhältnis zum Stofflichen hat. Sonst hätte man ihm auch nicht die Aufgabe übertragen, die Gasleitung durch die Spalte des Felsblockes zu legen, die das wichtigste Stück der Wohnung zu sein scheint. Eine Art Heiligtum. Ich frage die anderen, ob ihnen diese taktile Eigenart Plessners aufgefallen sei. Sie haben sie zwar gesehen, aber nicht in ihrer Bedeutsamkeit verstanden. -- Nächste Szene im Nachbarzimmer, also wieder dem Raum, in dem die Leitungen gelegt sind. Eine Frau, die vom Wohnungsamt in einen dritten angrenzenden Raum eingewiesen ist. Mit Pelzkragen und spiessigem Hut. Ich denke: Die wird nun eingewiesen und weiss sicher gar nicht, in was für einem Heiligtum sie wohnt. Dann ist auch Emmi dort. Ich will Licht machen, damit die Frau was sehen kann. Die Sicherung ist kaputt. Ich bringe sie in Ordnung. Emmi kommt an einen Draht und kann nicht wieder los. Der Strom hält sie fest, die Frau will ihr helfen, bleibt ebenfalls hängen. Emmi schreit. Ich will die Schnur losreissen. Es gelingt nicht. Ich laufe umher, schaue ins Nachbarzimmer, um Vater zu suchen, und schreie: "Haupthahn ausschalten, Haupthahn ausschalten..." -- allmähliches Erwachen mit starken Herzklopfen und grosser Angst.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0581 (1951-06-07, 07:00 - Freiburg)Angsttraum beim Erwachen während des Heulens einer Sirene. Orphées Tod musste selber sterben. Vom Auto überfahren. Die Leiche dargestellt durch einen Draht und eine elektrische Birne. Die Birne wirkt übrigens wie ein embryonaler Kopf eines zu früh geborenen Kaninchens, das ich einmal mit Schauder beseitigte und später wieder suchte, mit der Furcht, es könne noch leben. Orphées Tod als Leiche. Nur ein Draht und diese gläserne Birne -- und das war so erschütternd ähnlich. Die Frau, die in meiner Begleitung war, schrie sofort: "Ein Leichentuch. " Ich umfasste sie von hinten (um sie selber zugleich zu halten) und schloss die Augen und vergrub mich in ihrem Gewand, bis das Tuch in Eile gerafft und über die Leiche geworfen war. Das Ganze war in seiner surrealistischen Darstellung zugleich die Handlung eines Films. -- Folgende Vorgeschichte mit dauernden Changieren der Personen: Eine Hungersnot im Lande. Ein Mann musste sterben, weil er Sägespäne gegessen hatte. Ich höre gerade die Geschichte von ihm selbst erzählt. In dem Moment sehe ich andere -- Professoren der Musikhochschule und Studenten -- heimlich in ein Nebenzimmer gehen und in die Handtücher beissen, die dort hängen. Ich halte alle davon zurück, indem ich sie fortreisse, die in wollige Handtücher gebissen haben. -- Nur die, die in leinene gebissen haben, lasse ich daran hängen (wie ein Kind an den Brüsten der Mutter) -- vielleicht müssen auch sie sterben. Aber es ist möglich, dass sie am Leben bleiben. Einer der Männer, die ich fortgerissen habe, beisst stattdessen in meinen Anzug und durch den Stoff hindurch in meinen Leib (Bauch). Aber da er nur wenig Fleisch zu fassen bekommt, lasse ich ihn. Folgende Szene sehe ich wieder wie als Film: Ein Mädchen wird von einem Amerikaner in einem schönem Auto fortgenommen in die Welt, wo es zu essen gibt. Sie verspricht ihrem Geliebten, ihm alles Brot zuzuwerfen, das es ihm Wagen gibt. Ich sitze nun selbst an der Stelle des Mädchens, sehe sie aber dennoch zugleich zeitweilig ihre Rolle spielen. Der Amerikaner hat ihr keine Brotlaibe gegeben, nur gestrichenes Brot. Ich höre ihn sagen: "Du siehst, dass wir keinen Hunger haben: wenn man massenweise Quark aufs Brot klackt und doch selbst nichts isst." Ich denke, das Mädchen habe alles gegessen -- aber ich fühle -- jetzt wieder ihre Rolle spielend und an ihrem Platz im Wagen sitzend -- die in Pergamentpapier gewickelten Brote unter mir, halb seitlich -- sie versteckend auf ihnen sitzend. -- Ich will sie nun dem Geliebten, der jetzt -- als mein Partner -- eine Frau ist, zustecken. Sie steht ganz dicht am Wagen. Der Amerikaner scheint sich nicht umzukucken. Dann ist plötzlich der Amerikaner am Steuer fort. Ich sehe die Szene wieder als Film: Eine Frau -- der Tod Orphées, die gleichzeitig, da ich als Mann das Mädchen war, selbst als Frau die Rolle des Steuernden hat, sitzt nicht mehr im Wagen (wo jetzt schon wieder statt meiner das Mädchen, das ich zu spielen hatte, ratlos selber lenkend am Steuer des fremden Wagens sitzt). Der Tod Orphées jedoch, zugleich der eigentliche Steuermann des Wagens, liegt überfahren auf der Strasse -- inmitten eines Menschengewühls -- dargestellt nur durch einen Draht und eine dazugehörige gläserne Birne als Kopf, doch von so erschütternder Realistik, dass das Mädchen aus dem Wagen, die inzwischen wie eine Frau geworden ist, mich festhält und laut ruft: "Ein Leichentuch! " Das Tuch (ein weisses Laken) wird in Eile gerafft und über die Leiche geworfen. Ich schliesse die Augen, grabe meinen Kopf in ihrem Rücken in das Kleid der Frau und umklammere sie zugleich selbst, um sie vor dem Fallen zu bewahren. (595 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0588 (1951-06-18 - Freiburg)Traum von einem Mädchen, die mich in gebrochenem Deutsch ansprach. Sie war sehr schmal, trug einen Rock von gelblichem Leinen und eine Uniformjacke, darunter eine weisse Leinenbluse, die am Ausschnitt mit kleinen weissen Bändern leicht zugeschnürt war. Ich trug ein ähnliches Hemd, an dem sie mir die Bänder aufzog. Sie wollte einen "Bringe-Koffer" von mir geliehen haben. Ich zog sie heran, um sie zunächst zu erforschen. Specht stand abwartend im Hintergrund und antwortete nur mit "Sie müssen selber wissen", das in seinen Augen lag, auf meine fragenden Blicke. Ihre Sachen machten einen geordneten Eindruck und ihre Antworten zeugten von einer hohen Bildung. Verwundern tat mich die alte feldgraue Uniformjacke, die noch alle Dienstabzeichen trug. Später kam mir das Mädchen aus den Augen, das mich übrigens vor einem psychologischen Seminar angesprochen hatte, und ich machte mich auf, sie zu suchen. Auch jetzt noch beschäftigt mich die Gestalt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0589 (1951-06-20 - Freiburg)Heidegger wählt einen Kreis von Schülern, die dafür sorgen sollen, dass nur echtes Brot von ihm als "Heideggers Brot" in den Handel kommt. Darunter auch Specht und mich. Das Brot ist blütenweisses Weissbrot in einem runden Laib und sehr festes Vollkornbrot in ebensolchem Laib. Dann wird Kuchen verteilt. Ich möchte aber lieber von dem Brot. Dann von einem Film von Cocteau. Jetzt werden numerierte Exemplare des Buches, über das der Film gedreht ist, für eine Mark verkauft. Ich bekomme das letzte Exemplar. In dieses stehen einige Namen eingeschrieben, die das Buch vor mir besassen. Hier ist überhaupt der Szenenwechsel und der zuerst erzählte Traum kommt erst hier: Unter den Namen finde ich auch Spechts und meinen. Das ist dann die Karte, wo Heidegger die Namen der Brotbewahrer aufgeschrieben hat. Das Eine-Mark-Stück ist nun zu einer Drachme geworden, über die und deren Echtheit in dem Seminar gesprochen wird. Ich sehe mich in einer Szene die Drachme erhalten und in mein Portemonnaie stecken in einer Zeit, da sie noch gültig ist, also im alten Rom. Sodann schaue ich -- heute -- in mein Portemonnaie und sehe darin die Drachme. Ich schliesse daraus, dass ich sehr bewahrend gewesen bin und die Drachme vom alten Rom bis heute in ihrer Echtheit bewahrt habe. Ich bin glücklich darüber und erzähle es Heidegger während des Seminars. In der Erzählung aber durchschaue ich den Trugschluss und füge das hinzu: Die römische Szene muss Traum gewesen sein, sonst müsste man ja annehmen, dass ich zweitausend Jahre alt sei. Ich höre jemanden während des Seminars laut Flöte spielen. Ich nehme an, dass es der Bildhauer und Weinbauernsohn Graffe im Hintergrund ist. Graffe sitzt aber zugleich neben mir. Solche Doppelheit ist schon vorher in dem Traum einmal vorgekommen: Als ich in das Kino ging, sagte ich zu Gisela, die mich begleitete: "Beleg schon einmal einen Platz für mich mit, ich will noch mal raus gehen und sehen, ob Gisela da ist, obwohl ich nicht glaube, dass sie kommt, da sie in den letzten Tagen nicht mehr gekommen ist." -- Dann spricht Heidegger über Handschrift. Er malt eine Handschrift an die Tafel, und meint, dass man die Schrift stärker nicht vereinfachen könne. Ich erwidere, dass es sehr zerlöste Schriften gebe, die in ihrer Vereinfachung zugleich oft sehr schön seien. Er malt ein Beispiel an die Tafel: G r a f f. Ich sage: "Nein, nicht so. Hier sind ja nur die Buchstaben isoliert gesetzt. Ich will vielleicht selbst schnell ein Beispiel anschreiben." Man lacht. Ich erwache, während ich an die Tafel gehe und ein Bild des Wortes entwerfe, das ich anschreiben will: (Hier sind die Buchstaben G r a f f e sehr vereinfacht geschrieben). (444 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0590 (1951-06-17 - Freiburg)Erst vom Essen. Dann Aufstieg auf einer Treppe, zusammen mit Karl Marx. Ich sage: "Ihr Name kommt mir bekannt vor". " Er: "Sie denken an den Marxisten. " Ich: "Nicht so sehr. Zunächst an den Maler, an den Bildhauer und andere. " -- "Sie wohnen hier?" Er: "Ja, auf dem Boden habe ich ein Zimmer. Dort lese ich und schreibe ich." Ich: "Werden Sie sehr überwacht? " Er: "Nein, nicht besonders." (Es ist während der Nazizeit.) Ich steige während des Gesprächs höher mit ihm die Treppe hinauf, als ich eigentlich gewollt hatte. Plötzlich steht ein Hund im Weg, an einer Leine, die aber so befestigt ist, dass er sie samt ihrem Befestigungspunkt mit sich ziehen kann. Karl Marx geht vorbei. Ich weiche zurück. Die Treppe hinab. Der Hund folgt mir. Angst. Dann aber plötzlich hält er inne, weil auf einmal am anderen Ende der Leine ein Hase angebunden ist, so dass sich beide die Waage halten. Ich werde erheitert der Traumsymbolik inne und erwache langsam. Vorher andere Träume: Ich soll für meine Schwester telephonieren. Die Verbindung kommt immer nicht zustande (Ferngespräch nach Kiel).

Ich wollte dirigieren, hob schwungvoll meine Hände, während die Musik intonierte, konnte jedoch meine eigenen Hände vor meinen eigenen Augen nicht sehen. So zog es sich lange hin. Ich sah zum Beispiel eine Drehscheibe, als ich aber gemerkt hatte, dass es wieder nur eidetisch war, und die Augen öffnete, sah ich, dass die Leisten aus dem Gestänge über meinem Bett das Bild erzeugt hatten. Diese war jedoch da immer noch anders als in Wirklichkeit. Die Grenzen zwischen Traum und Aufwachen sind hier kaum anzugeben, weil der Traum selbst durch das Thema Eidetik sich verschleierte. Auch sah ich einmal ein Blatt, auf dem ich versucht hatte, einen Traum aufzuschreiben, ohne dass es gelungen war. Die Worte waren sinnlos verteilt und zum Teil sinnlos wiederholt, senkrecht untereinander lauter Wiederholungen. Dann wachte ich aber erst richtig auf, und nun war auch das Blatt fort. Erst jetzt komme ich zu dem Schluss -- das natürlich alles nur Traum war -- also erst etwa fünf Minuten nach dem Erwachen. (167 words)

Am Tore eines Bauernhofes hatte ich beim Aussteigen die Mappe mit meinen Traumaufzeichnungen stehen lassen. Ich kehrte also noch einmal zurück, fand sie auch, doch trat mir nun ein Bulle in den Weg, obzwar noch sehr klein, wie ein Kalb, der die Hörner nach mir ausreckte. Ich versuchte, ihn mit den Augen zu bannen und an seinen Hörnern zu ergreifen, doch er begann, mich zu beissen, und als ich schon die Hand zwischen den Zähnen hatte, erkannte ich das Traumbild und wachte allmählich auf.

Es war ein schwieriges und komplexes Gebilde, das am Ende völlig in sich selbst zurück schwand, als die letzten Träume die Schlüssel aller ersten enthielten. Wie ein roter Faden geht durch diese Träume das Bedürfnis, zunächst von der Hitze und Schwüle sich abzudecken und das Kopfkissen immerwährend zu verschieben, und zuletzt gegen Morgen in der Kühle sich langsam zu bedecken. Dies in der Form, dass die vorher zerlegten Handschriften langsam wieder deutlich wurden und sich in ihren Formen zeigten. Alles Inhaltliche habe ich vergessen, doch ist es, als hätte ich einen grossen Haufen der Stilgerüste abgegessener Weintrauben vor mir, die ich in der Nacht verspeiste. Das Ganze war wie eine starke Prüfung oder Probe, in der es um das Durchhalten ging, und in der das Glück sich in der Zeit behauptete. (160 words)

Sie sagte mir, man hielte sich deswegen für verrückt, da man dächte, dass sie alle meine Sonderheiten nun auch annehmen würde wie Aktstehen in der Akademie, sich paradiesisch sonnen auf dem Dach, eine rote Badehose haben, in Sandalen spazieren gehen. Sie schrieb eine Bilderschrift, in der sie mir dies aufzeichnete. Sie sagte: Das ist die Schrift der Graphologen. Aus einem ungeheuer gleitenden, nur von dem Bild geführten und durch keine Form schematisierten Bewegungsfluss sprangen die Bilder hervor, leuchteten die Glieder auf, die sie auf das Papier zeichnete.

Indessen wäre auch eine Traumdeutung möglich, die das Sein des Traums nicht von hierher auslegen, sondern von dem ausgehen würde, was sich im Traum uns zeigt -- Tiere und Gestalten, die darin ihr Leben haben. Beide Ansichten sind wahrscheinlich richtig. Auch wird man hier den Schichtungsgedanken anwenden dürfen. Man könnte - analog zur Deutung der Handschrift -von einem Triebbild des Traumes treffen (wie vom Bewegungsbild der Schrift), dem die Entschlüsselung nachspüren würde -- dann von einem Formbild, das uns in der Art und in dem Niveau seiner Verschlüsselung interessieren würde -- und endlich von der Welt des Traumes im Ganzen, von der Art, wie wir darin in unser Leben eingelassen sind: seinen Raum: und Zeitbild. Dies würde die eigentlich geschichtliche Seite des Traumes ausmachen. Der Ort der Handlung, ihre Zeit, die Fülle der Zeiten, der Wechsel der Szene, die Verdichtung der Personen würden hierher gehören. So hätten wir Bewegung, Stil und Räumlichkeit des Traums. Endlich ist wichtig noch die Sicht auf Möglichkeiten, sein Abtasten der Zukunft, sein Tendieren auf ein Telos. Auch das Hyletische im Traum ist wichtig. Die Stofflichkeit, die in ihm vorherrscht und gesucht wird, endlich der Einschlag unserer körperlichen Masse, den die Auslegung in ihrer Messung zu Grunde zu legen hat. -- So gibt es sehr viele Gesichtspunkte für die Auslegung des Traums.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0618 (1951-07-15 - Freiburg)Traum heute nacht: Ich fuhr mit Specht in der Eisenbahn und musste an einer Station Köln-Sülz umsteigen. Ich sah hinter dem Bahnsteig die Gewässer und jenseits als schmalen Streifen das bewaldete Ufer. Jedoch dachte ich, dass erst die nächste Station der Ort meines Umsteigens. Als der Zug anfuhr, kam es heraus, dass wir bereits Köln-Sülz verlassen hatten. Mich bestürzte der Gedanke, das ganze nun kommende Stück zurückfahren zu müssen, denn der D-Zug, in dem wir sassen, würde nun bis zur nächsten Grossstadt viele Stunden durchfahren. Ehe ich mich entschliessen konnte, abzuspringen und mein Gepäck hinauszuwerfen, hatte der Zug eine solche Geschwindigkeit erreicht, das dies nicht mehr möglich war. Kurz hinter der Station jedoch bremste er noch einmal, ich sprang heraus, Specht warf mir meine Koffer nach und stieg, schon im Anrollen des Zuges, noch selbst hinaus, um ein schwereres Stück hinabzusetzen. Dabei fuhr auch ihm der Zug davon. (148 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0619 (1951-07-15 - Freiburg)Ich trug irgendetwas in der Tasche, was durch seinen Geruch die Hunde anziehen musste. Ein kleiner Windhund, der mir begegnete, kehrte denn auch sofort um, als er den Geruch witterte, und versuchte, mir spielend in die Hände zu beissen. Ich dachte, ihn fortzuscheuchen, indem ich mit der Tasche wedelte. Über dem kam noch ein anderes Tier hinzu. Ich sagte: Ach, nun kommt auch noch eine Gans. - "Ich bin doch keine Gans, ich bin doch eine Ente", antwortete es. Ich versuchte nun, die Tiere abzustreifen, indem ich in einen Korridor entwich, von welchem rechts eine Tür zum Badezimmer führte. Am Eingang zum Korridor war an der Wand ein Turm von leeren Streichholzschachtelfächern aufgerichtet, halb zum Spiel, die bei meinem Durchgang umfielen. Ich versuchte, sie wieder aufzurichten. Es gelang mir jedoch nicht. Die obersten Stücke warfen jeweils den Turm um. Die Situation verdichtete sich: Es war vor Weihnachten. Das Bauen des Turmes nahm Geschenkcharakter an. Mein Bruder und mein Vater, der im Badezimmer aus der Wanne gestiegen war, halfen mir. Wir hatten eine Idee: Man müsste die Schachteln stärken. Dann würden sie in sich fest sein und aneinander und an der ölfarbigen Wand haften. Mein Vater holte also aus seiner Kragenschachtel ein wenig Stärkepulver, wir schütteten es in sein Badewasser, das sich damit rotbräunlich färbte und warfen alle Streichholzschachteln hinein. Dann baute ich den Turm, während mein Bruder mir die Schachteln aus dem Wasser zuwarf. Der Bau unterlag nun jedoch einer neuen Störung, denn mein Vater hatte Bücher und Hefte mit in den Turm gefügt, die aus irgend einem Grunde ebenfalls ins Wasser geraten waren. Ich musste also den Turm einreissen und von vorne beginnen. Um der grösseren Festigkeit willen baute ich diesmal zwei Reihen nebeneinander hoch. Doch reichten die Schachteln jetzt nicht mehr die Wand hinauf, sondern nur bis zu einem Bord, das vorher nicht da gewesen war. So blieb der Trum ein Torso, als ich erwachte und ihn wie visionär unter dem Weihnachtsbaum sah. (325 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0620 (1951-07-16 - Freiburg)Traum von einer Verzauberung, in der ich schweben konnte über Gängen und Treppen durch märchenhafte Feste und endlich (hungrig), wieder zurückkam in die kellerhafte Zellen, in denen ich als Soldat lebte. Doch erlebte ich dies alles zugleich wie ein Märchen, in dessen Hauptfigur nur von ferne mein eigenes Ich einfloss. Die Rückkehr war schwierig, da ich das lange Fehlen im Dienst motivieren musste. Auch konnte ich die Zelle nicht wiederfinden, da ich sie mit Aborten verwechselte. -- Davor ein anderer Traum, in dem ich mit halbzahmen Antilopen spielte. Als sie mich jedoch beissen wollten, lockte ich sie in ihre Ställe zurück. Sie drohte -- die eine -- jedoch, mich über die halbhohe Barriere wieder anzuspringen, weil sie unzufrieden war, dass ihr das angespannte Gummiseil fehlte, auf dem sie sonst mit aufgestützten Vorderpfoten auf- und niederhüpfte und sich so austobte. Ich lief sofort zu Emmi, die für den Stall verantwortlich war, und teilte ihr das Unheil mit. (156 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0621 (1951-07-19 - Freiburg)Schiffahrt über den Ozean. Mit zwei Amerikanern in eine Kabine, in der nur langweilige Leute waren. Wir siedelten darum in eine Kabine über, die die Amerikaner ausfindig gemacht hatten, weil in ihr nur zwei Mädchen wohnten. Wir sahen zunächst die Betten und zwei Sofas, später die Mädchen selber. Szenenwechsel: Nacht. Ich war neben dem Bett, in dem das eine Mädchen, eine Türkin, lag, mit sehr braunem Gesicht, die einen strengen Eindruck machte. Das andere Mädchen, eine Asiatin, mit blendend weissen Zähnen, die sich zu ihrem hellen Haar eine dunkle Locke ins Gesicht gemacht hatte, legte sich neben mich, und versuchte, mich zu sich zu ziehen. Sie war im ganzen derber als die Türkin, aber von stärkerer Vitalität. Ich fühlte mich zwischen beiden hin- und hergerissen, glitt aber schliesslich zu der Asiatin, da die Türkin mir zu unbeweglich schien. Dann verlief sich die Szene. -- Nächste Szene: Ich suchte -- mit Emmis Assistenz -- meine Decken in dem Schiff und fand sie alle bis auf eine gestreifte, die der Baumgärtnerin gehörte (das ist diejenige, mit der ich immer in der Sonne auf dem Dach liege. Paradiesisch. Dabei hat sie sehr gelitten und ich möchte nicht, dass die Baumgärtnerin sie sieht, ehe Emmi sie geflickt hat). Das Schiff glich bei diesem Suchen einer Bühne, auf der man nach dem Schauspiel seine Utensilien zusammensucht. Schliesslich fand ich eine gestreifte Decke. Es war aber nicht die richtige. Da leuchtete mir ein, dass die richtige auf dem anderen Schiff sein müsse, das längst in eine andere Himmelsrichtung gefahren war. Der Kabinenwechsel war also inzwischen zum Schiffswechsel (in der Traumerinnerung) geworden. Ich schwankte nun, ob ich die gefundene Decke nehmen solle, da die andere mir ja unzugänglich war. Als ich mich aufrichtete, bemerkte ich im Spiegel meine Tätowierung, die ich mir auf dem Schiff hatte machen lassen: Meine Wappenfarben schwarz-silber-rot, in breiten Streifen um die Schultern gelegt, so wie das blonde asiatische Mädchen, die sich zu mir gelegt hatte, ein breit um die Schultern gestreiftes Gewand hatte, das einer umgeworfenen Kamelhaardecke glich, deren Meandermuster einen breiten Streifen um die Schultern bildete. Die breiten bunten Streifen waren aus der Haut wahrscheinlich nicht mehr zu entfernen, und ich erkannte nun, dass das Mädchen und die beiden Amerikaner mich geprägt hatten. (372 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0624 (1951-07-21 - Freiburg)Ernst Jünger schenkte mir eine sehr schöne Facsimile-Ausgabe der Zeichnungen Jean Cocteaus, die ich auf einem Spaziergang mit ihm und seinem Begleiter beschaute, während dieser ihm einen längeren Traum wiedererzählte, den Jünger ihm am Morgen nach dem Erwachen mitgeteilt, dann aber selbst wieder vergessen hatte. Den Inhalt, der lang und sehr interessant war, so dass Jünger selbst im Zuhören über einige Wendungen immer wieder überrascht war, habe ich leider vergessen. Mit der Facsimile-Ausgabe der Zeichnungen Cocteaus hatte es noch einen besondere Bewandtnis. Sie war gebunden wie Giselas Facsimile-Ausgabe der Violin-Sonaten Bachs, die ich zur Zeit bei mir habe. Sie hatte neben meinem Bett an der Mauer gestanden und war von dieser in der Regenzeit durchgefeuchtet, so dass die Zeichungen gelbe Ränder bekommen hatten, die ich später mit dem Radiergummi zu entfernen suchte. Dazu ist bemerkenswert: ich habe unter meinen Büchern eine allerdings nur primitiv brochierte Ausgabe der Zeichnungen Cocteaus "de la table ronde" aus dem Institut Français liegen. In meinem Traumbuch nun kamen aus diesem Exemplar gerade die Zeichnungen vor, die die Eifersucht des Artus darstellen und die ich immer mit Genugtuung betrachtet habe. Dort gibt es ein Bild (la jalousie d'Artus), wo er der Frau eine Ohrfeige auszuteilen scheint, was dadurch ausgedrückt ist, dass sein Arm schon ausholt, ihr Gesicht aber von einem merkwürdig dunklen Fleck verdeckt ist. Specht hat diese Zeichnung auf einem Blatt kopiert (unter dem Titel "Die Ohrfeige by Jean Cocteau"), das ebenfalls zwischen meinen Büchern liegt. Mit den Regenflecken hat es nun folgende Bewandtnis: auf der einen Seite spielt dies Bild der Ohrfeige mit dem verdunkelnden Flecken hinein, auf der anderen Seite die Befürchtung, die Facsimile-Ausgabe Bachs, die bei diesem Traumbild Pate gestanden hat, könne bei Regen unter meinem Fenster Schaden leiden. Endlich an die Wand direkt neben meinem Bett, die im Traum durchfeuchtet war, stelle ich zuweilen Bilder, die ich vor dem Schlafengehen betrachten will, so vor allem Aktaufnahmen. Hier verdichten sich also die Eifersucht und die Leidenschaft mit dem Symbol der Überflutung, die im Flecken sichtbar wird. Die Rolle Cocteaus ist in meinen Vorstellungen im Augenblick sehr entscheidend, da ich mir ihn zum Lehrmeister wünsche, seit ich den Film Orphée gesehen habe. In dieses Buch nun war Jüngers Widmung eingeschrieben, wie in die Ausgabe der goldenen Muschel und Myrduns, die er mir nach seiner Rückkehr aus Antibes schickte. Ich wartete damals eine Weile mit der Antwort, und so war ich im Traum sehr verwirrt, weil ich nicht wusste, ob ich mich schon für die die Cocteau-Ausgabe bedankt hatte. - (Anderer Traum). Auf der Strasse (Schwerin) tanzten Neger. Einer fuhr auf Rollschuhen sehr schnell dahin. Dann kam ein amerikanisches Auto (Jeep) entgegen, auf dem auf einer braun-gelben Decke die Einrichtung eines Indianerzeltes und zwei Leichen ausgebreitet waren. Die toten Indianer trugen Sonnenbrillen. Ich schrie dem Auto nach: "Ihr seid Mörder, Ihr verruchten Hunde, Ihr seid Mörder, nur wegen eines Skalps". Aufwachen mit Erregung und Herzklopfen. - (Anderer Traum). Auf der Strasse (Schwerin) tanzten Neger. Einer fuhr auf Rollschuhen sehr schnell dahin.

Gisela stand in schwarzer Kleidung neben mir in dem Raum, in dem man auf den Sarg wartete. Neben ihr trug jemand die kleinen Kinder auf dem Arm. Gisela wurde sehr traurig und wir gingen in einen Nebenraum, wo sie zu weinen begann. Dann war der Leichenwagen gekommen, aber als wir in den Raum zurückkamen, stand da nicht ein richtiger Sarg, sondern nur eine ringsum geschlossene Tragbahre aus glattem Holz, wie man sie zum ersten Transport der Toten verwendet und die in der Form an ägyptische Mumiensärge erinnern, da sie auf die Raummasse des Körpers zugeschnitten sind.

Wohl eine Vorstellung im nachbildhaften Farben. Das Gesicht hatte strahlende, beglückende Züge. Dann von dieser Kammer, in der ich zusammen mit Gisela und meinem Bruder schlief. Der Raum war eng, doch das Erwachen heiter. Mein Bruder war zum Spassen aufgelegt, Gisela versonnen und verspielt, entkleidete sich schliesslich ganz und ich fasste sie lange ins Auge. Später sah ich aus meinem anders gestellten Bett durch ein klares gläsernes Fenster über eine weite Landschaft bis zu den Vogesen, die sich mit den weissbeschneiten Kuppen deutlich am Ende des Bildes abhoben. Mir fällt dazu jetzt das Bild Van Goghs, die Landschaft mit dem blauen Wagen, ein, das ungeheuer tief, gegliedert am Ende den Blick in den leichten Mittelgebirgszügen fängt, das unter meinem Fenster steht, aus welchem man bei klarem Wetter am Horizont über der Stadt als blauen, wolkenhaften Streifen die Vogesen sieht. Mit Gisela sprach ich gestern abend über einige Bilder van Goghs, darunter eine Landschaft, deren Tiefe sie beglückte. Später änderte sich der Traum, ich kniete auf meinem Stuhl, hatte das Lukenfenster hochgeschlagen, und sah auf die Dinge direkt hinter dem abfallenden Dach, die ich sonst übersehen hatte. Da war ein Kanal, wie ich später merkte, die Dreisam, über die Brücken führten, jenseits seiner eine Autostrasse. Dann setzte sich das Ganze in Bewegung. Die Kammer war in einem Zug. Wir bogen von dem Kanal ab und näherten uns den Bergen. Ich merkte immer mehr, wie alle diese Bilder nur Traumbilder waren, blieb jedoch noch eine Weilte mit geschlossenen Augen liegen und nahm sie in das allmähliche Erwachen hinein. (273 words)

Später beobachtete ich aus einem der Zimmer dieses Hauses eine Achterbahn, die genau bis zur Höhe des Fensters anstieg, so dass ich den Insassen des Wagens ins Gesicht sehen konnte. Endlich in einem dieser Zimmer, in welchen -- wie in einem Freudenhaus -- für Geld, das man auf den Tisch legte -- Aktmodelle zum Zeichnen verkauft wurden.

Die Lage meiner Freiburger Mansarde spielte dabei eine Rolle. Zuletzt noch bei dem Einstieg in die Luke drohten Blätter und Flaschen hinabzustürzen. Die beschriebenen Blätter rettete ich. Die Flaschen dagegen fielen in die Dachrinne, wo ich sie zunächst stehen liess, da ich zur ihrer Bergung nicht mehr die Kraft hatte und auf dem schrägen roten Dach abgeglitten wäre. Etwas weiter unten sah ich Gesine am Fenster ihrer Mansarde hantieren. Sie benutzte die Dachrinne zum Kühlstellen der Flaschen, die ihr von ihrem Fenster aus so greifbar blieben. Später spielte Plessner eine Rolle, der mit der Gestalt Heideggers zusammenhing. Er gab meiner Mutter einen Beleg über meinen Zustand in dem Käfig. Wir warteten dabei auf dem Bahnsteig einer Kleinbahn. Kurz ehe die Lokomotive kam, fiel meine Sonnenbrille auf die Schienen. Ich wollte sie retten, stiess dabei mit dem Fuss dagegen und zertrümmerte sie. Zuletzt war meine Mutter krank, jedoch im Zustand vorübergehender Besserung. Als sie eine Weile unseren Gastgebern berichtet hatte, trieb ich sie zum Aufbruch, da ihr das Sprechen zuviel geworden wäre. (191 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0643 (1951-08-10 - Wittmoldt)Fahrt mit einer kleinen und schmalen und offenen Eisenbahn, auf der man wie auf einem Karussell sass. Ich war mit Gisela aus dem Norden Bremens bis nach Freiburg gekommen und auf dem Rückweg. Wir durchquerten -- das Verkehrsmittel hatte sich nun wohl geändert - , eine Stadt, in der der Verkehr lautlos vor sich ging. Gepflegte breite Strassen, durch die die Kolonnen der Autos rollten und eine fürstlich heitere Barockkirche. Es war der Sitz des Erzbischofs, gegen dessen moralische Tiraden in Freiburg ich eine Abscheu hegte. Vorher die Besteigung eines Aussichtsturms, der in seiner Eisenkonstruktion der offenen Eisenbahn glich und dessen Besteigung ähnlicher Vorsicht bedurfte. Die beiden Bilder gingen überhaupt ineinander über. So war es vor allem wichtig, sich an den zu zweien und in Form der Quadrille angelegten Sitzen gut festzuhalten und nicht von der Fliehkraft fortgerissen zu werden. Ähnliches galt von dem ob der leichten Bauweise leise schwankenden Turm. Merkwürdig war es, dass man festen Grund erreichte, nachdem man schon lange gestiegen war. Es musste an der bergigen Form der Landschaft liegen. Überhaupt gingen Steigen und Fahren in ihrer Bewegung ineinander über. (184 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0644 (1951-08-13 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Vater. Zum Einschlafen halten wir eine von zwei gleichzeitig tickenden Uhren an. Dann von der Baumgärtnerin. Apfelpflücken. Jemand redet von der Reife: "Die müssten seit dem ersten September reif sein, wie die Schönheitsköniginnen". Die Baumgärtnerin sagt: "Da war neulich eine bei mir sogar, - eine kalmarische Medizinstudentin, die hier in der Nähe ihr Quartier aufgeschlagen hat, und den Käfig (meine Stube also) zum Arbeiten haben wollte. Wenn er frei gewesen wäre. Die hatte so schöne Glieder, dass ich mich immer wieder nach ihr umgesehen habe". (Die Baumgärtnerin ist Malerin). Dann erzählte sie ihre Geschichte (die ich bald von der Stimme der Studentin selber hörte, dann auch als Traumhandlung sah): "Ich wurde von einer Freundin aufgefordert, da hin zu fahren. Das tat ich auch. Der Dirigent war gerade beim Spielen. Meine Freundin sagte, ich sollte ihn einfach unterbrechen. Da sagte ich, ich muss mich erst mal nach der Reise waschen, und dann gingen wir an das Wasser und ich sagte: Ich bin so braun, dass ich mich ganz ausziehen kann. Da sagte meine Freundin so laut, dass es der Dirigent hören konnte: Nur unter den Achseln ist sie noch etwas weiss, sonst ist sie überall so braun, auch in der Mitte und unten." Da schielte der Dirigent schon etwas nach ihr hin und nachher unterbrach er seine Musik. (219 words)

Der alte Mann, der mich wohl noch aus der Zeit meines Vaters kannte, setzte seine ganze Bude wie eine Strassenbahn in Bewegung, da er die von mir gewünschte Sorte nicht mehr vorrätig hatte und sie erst einkaufen musste. Später fuhr ich auf Emmis Fahrrad und begegnete Ingemarie und ihrem Mann, die gestern hier waren. Das Fahrrad war indessen so hoch in der Lenkstange, dass ich die Arme nach oben ausrecken musste, um zu fahren. Zugleich war es so kurz gebaut, dass ich die Hände dabei hinter dem Kopf kreuzen konnte, so wie Gisela schläft. Das Rad war im übrigen rot wie Giselas Rad. (107 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0646 (1951-08-15 - Wittmoldt)Traum von einer Autofahrt aus Horst. Wir nahmen viele halbvolle, jedoch unverkorkte Weinflaschen mit, die wir nachträglich noch notdürftig verschlossen. Der Hof selbst hatte mehr die Form eines grossen Landhauses mit angebauten Ställen. An seinem Eingang musste man Hunde, Schafe und Ziegen passieren, die alle angriffslustig waren. (47 words)

Zuletzt in einem Atelier der Kunstakademie, wo ich mich am Zeichnen eines weiblichen Aktes beteiligte. Ich begann damit, die sehr markanten Beckenpartien aufzuzeichnen.

Dann eine andere Szene, in der Willi Birgel eine Beratung führte. Die Versammlung selbst war nicht zu sehen, jedoch wurde die Länge der Beratung durch drei niederbrennende Kerzen auf einem Barockleuchter dargestellt, die sich zuletzt vor Hitze zur Erde bogen. Aus diesem Traumbild wurde ich durch Feelis Klopfen geweckt, die über den See gesetzt werden wollte. (118 words)

Er hatte sie dazu aus dem alten Rahmen genommen, und es stellte sich heraus, dass auf dem unsichtbaren Teil des Papiers noch mehrere sehr schöne Engelsköpfe in barocker Art skizziert waren. Mein Vater hielt sie nicht für echt und wollte diesen Teil des Papiers abreissen, da er ihn wegen seiner helleren Farbe nur für angeklebt hielt und annahm, meine Mutter hätte das gemacht. Ich wollte gerne das Stück als Ganzes erhalten und flehte ihn an, bis er endlich die schon zum Riss angesetzte Hand zurücknahm. Ich hatte dabei grosse Angst und erwachte mit starkem Herzklopfen, während mich noch lange das Bild der Engelsköpfe verfolgte. (114 words)

So fuhren wir eine kleine, steil ansteigende Nebenstrasse, die tunnelartig gewunden nach dem Prinzip einer Achterbahn angelegt war: Man wurde mit kleinen Zahnradketten hochgeschoben. Nach der Überwindung des Höhepunktes tauchte vor uns das Münster auf mit mächtigem dreigeteiltem Längsschiff, das Dach besetzt mit einer Fülle kleiner Dachreiter im heiteren Stil, die Filigranarbeit des Turmes im Nebel fast verborgen.

Wir betrachteten ein Aktbildnis, dessen Figur ähnlich wie die alten Fruchtbarkeitsgöttinnen viele Brüste hatte. Umstehende lachten, doch sie erklärte ihnen, dass dies völlig ernst sei. Später sassen wir allein auf einem Bett und ich tastete ihre Glieder ab. Als ich die Oberschenkel berührte, sagte sie: "Das darfst du nicht" in dem gebrochenen Deutsch, das ein Ausländer spricht. Doch ich widersprach und handelte nicht danach. Später befanden wir uns mit dem Bett in dem grossen Jungenszimmer in Wittmoldt, in dem viele Jungens und Mädchen durcheinander schliefen -- etwas zur Verwunderung der "Erwachsenen". Das Bett war wunderbar leicht gefedert und wiegend wie ein Boot. Zuletzt in einem Szenenwechsel wandelte es sich in einen ganz leichten Dogcard-Wagen, von einem trabenden Pferd gezogen, den ich fast spielend lenkte und beinahe liegend ausgestreckt. Andere Szenen waren mit dem Traum verquickt. So ging ich mit der Griechin in einen Raum, in dem bis vor kurzem ein Toter gelegen hatte, und suchte dort die Bettwäsche. Auch später beim Essen waren die Toten anwesend, so die alte Frau v.K. (197 words)

Zugleich schaute man genau winkelrecht zu dieser Anlage auf das Ludwigsluster Schloss. Wir begaben uns nun schwebend in einer Bahn in Richtung auf das Schloss zu, und während dieser Fahrt tauchten wie Sterne in wunderbarer geometrischer Ordnung die übrigen Bauwerke der Stadt, so der Dom, auf, die aus dem Grün hervorstrebten. -- Später Traum von Barbara Köhler, die mir zur Veröffentlichung des Webetanzes helfen wollte.

An der Hastigkeit ihrer Bewegungen und der Art, wie einer von ihnen die Lebensmittel prüfte, indem er sie zwischen den Händen unter der Nase rieb, merkte ich die Illegitimität ihres Vorhabens. Ich fasste mir ein Herz und trat dazwischen, um sie zu verscheuchen. Sie schimpften zwar, waren aber eingeschüchtert. Später wurden sie durch ein richtiges Mittagessen gestillt, in dem es Pfannkuchen gab.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0683 (1951-09-28 - Göttingen)Ich wohnte sehr hoch in einem Hause und schaute hinaus auf die Strasse. Unten stand Gisela, frech die Beine etwas gespreizt, und war wie ein grosses Mädchen. Später, ich hatte mich von oben mit ihr über ihre neuesten Arbeitsmöglichkeiten unterhalten, sie verkaufte nämlich Apparate für den Apfelsinenbaum und musste dafür nach Afrika oder an die Nordsee reisen, wo man Apfelsinen baute, - später also kamen einige andere Mädchen, die sehr steif aussahen, und sehr dünne, kalkweisse Beine hatten. Sie waren wie zu einem Umzug formiert, denn es war der erste Mai. Gisela liess sich von ihnen mitnehmen, denn sie meinte: "Wenn ich bei den Leutchen arbeite, muss ich wohl auch mit ihnen marschieren." Dann kam ein jüngerer Mann die Strasse lang, hob etwas auf: "Hier liegt ein Halstuch, das hat jemand liegengelassen, das darf aber nicht sein." Er zeigte es hoch: "Wem gehört das?" Es war mein wollenes Halstuch, das mir Emmi einmal schenkte, und ich rief: "Hier". Er warf es an die Ecke meines Hauses, und ich ging aus der Wohnung und segelte auf dem Geländer die vielen Treppen hinunter. Eine Etage unter mir wohnte Gisela. Ich dachte im Vorbeigehen: wie schön, so dicht beieinander zu wohnen, das hätte Gisela noch bis vor kurzem nicht für gut gehalten. Unten war ich ganz taumelig von den vielen Kurven des Treppengeländers und suchte mir halb kriechend, halb an den Wänden gehend, den Weg durch den noch dunklen Flur. Draussen auf der kleinen Haustreppe, ungefähr da, wo mein Tuch hingefallen war, lag Kottmeier, um sich auszuruhen, doch so auf den Stufen, dass die Beine oben lagen und der Kopf ganz unten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0690 (1951-10-04 - Freiburg)Beim Arzt. Ich habe mir den Kopf gestossen (so wie Gisela gestern). Der Arzt ist sehr besorgt (so wie Giselas Eltern gestern) und ordnet eine umständliche Behandlung an. Die Anordnung ist aber illusorisch, denn ich will schon am Nachmittag auf Reisen gehen. Jedoch der Arzt und einer seiner Patienten, ein Herr von Sowieso, laden mich zu einem Kirmesfest im Orte ein. Das Angebot ist verlockend, doch ich lehne ab. Ich ging zunächst zu Fuss, reiste dann auf einem Fahrzeug, einer kleinen Landmaschine, deren federnder Eisensitz sehr dicht über der Erde war, man sass fast liegend. Grosse Räder, die die Sicht nach vorne hinderten, und eine Antriebskraft, die mir unbekannt war. Mit diesem Fahrzeug rollte ich über die Feldwege, zuweilen den Saaten ausweichend, vor allem als Polizei in der Nähe war. Einmal standen in einem Hohlweg Katzen im Wege. Eine sprang nicht schnell genug hinweg, und ich hörte einen Aufschrei, wie man ihn zuweilen nachts von Frauen hört, denn ich war ihr über das Bein gefahren. Ich hatte nun eine Begleiterin, die mich vor mir selbst entschuldigte. Es war eine Reiterin im dunklen Reitanzug mit einer eleganten Jockey-Mütze. Ich folgte ihr mit einem zweiten Pferd im gemessenen Abstand. Ich trug einen roten Rock und Zylinder. Nach einer Weile kam uns eine Jagdgesellschaft entgegen und die Reiterin wollte ihres Renommés wegen jetzt das zweite Pferd neben sich haben. Mich ärgerte dieser Zug, und ich stieg deswegen ab und jagte ihr das zweite Pferd ohne Reiter nach. Indessen sah ich schon von unten ein anderes Pferd entgegenkommen und befürchtete einen Zusammenstoss. Das andere Pferd kam immer schneller heran und ich fürchtete, da die Strasse furchtbar schmal war, nun selbst von dem galoppierenden Tier überrannt zu werden. Ich erinnerte mich, kurz vorher eine Nische gesehen zu haben, und tastete mich zu dieser zurück, die Gasse war jetzt nicht breiter als mein Körper und wie von Schränken gebildet, zuweilen so eng, dass ich mich nur noch hindurch-quetschen konnte. Auch wurde ich -- wie vom Sturm -- von einer unsichtbaren Macht zurückgehalten. Ich krallte die Finger hinter kleine Vorsprünge und Leisten und versuchte, mit ausgestrecktem Arm mich weiter heranzuziehen. Die erste Nische war zu eng. Schliesslich hatte ich die richtige erreicht, in der ich gerade Platz hatte. Das Pferd schien den Eingang in die Gasse nicht gefunden zu haben. Als ich mich langsam vorbeugte, sah ich jedoch einen Schatten und bald darauf ein Geweih um einen Vorsprung auftauchen, das dem Schatten voraus geworfen hatte. Dann stand der Hirsch vor mir. Ich drückte mich in die Nische, in die er mit dem breiten Geweih nicht hinein konnte, und streichelte ihm die Nase. Später jedoch beugte der Hirsch seinen Kopf nieder, um mit dem Geweih meinen Fuss zu beharken, der aus der Nische hervorragte. Ich erwachte mit dem Gedanken, so wie Nicolai Hartmann auf dem einsamen Weg zum Mount Wilson die Adler, die in bedrohlicher Nähe kreisten, durch die Gebärde des Anlegens verscheuchte, mich auch aus dieser Nische zu befreien.

Ich mochte ihn am Morgen nicht aufschreiben, da er mich in Missstimmung versetzte. Erst beim Erzählen leuchtete mir sein Sinn ein. Nach Anderem, das ich vergessen habe: Ich drang mit einem Gewehr bewaffnet in ein Zimmer ein, in dem Banditen waren. Als ich abdrücken wollte, stellte sich heraus, dass die Waffe ungeladen war. In diesem kritischen Moment schlug einer der Räuber eine Pistole gegen mich an. Ich ergriff ihn bei der Faust und versuchte, die Waffe abzuwenden und auf seine Kumpanen zu richten. Ich drückte ab, als es nach einigem Ringen gelang. Da spritzte eine braune Masse heraus, die in alle Richtungen zerstob und die Getroffenen mit kleinen Spritzern übersäte. "Wissen Sie, womit Sie geschossen haben?" fragte der Besitzer der Pistole. "Nein". - "Mit Kaffee". Ich musste sehr lachen, aber einer der Getroffenen erwiderte: "Sie haben gut lachen. Wenn Sie wüssten, wie das brennt!" Es war eine Art von gebranntem noch glühend heissem Kaffee, oder, das was zurückbleibt, wenn man die Bohnen aus der Pfanne nimmt. Dann kam der Kommissar und verhaftete mich. Er führte mich in eine Amtszimmer und sagte: "Sie werden jetzt die Folgen tragen müssen von dem, was Sie angerichtet haben." (203 words)

Dann zeige ich ihr eine Reihe von Marienbildern, auf deren einem man die Maria schon nach der Empfängnis mit tragendem Unterleib sieht. Erwache. (114 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0694 (1951-10-09 - Freiburg)Anderer Traum, von der Frankfurter Messe. Es gilt, viele Leitern zu ersteigen, um in den Ausstellungsraum zu kommen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0695 (1951-10-09 - Freiburg)Andere Träume: Ein neues Buch von Ernst Jünger, in dem er mich zitiert hatte mit den Worten: "So beruht die Verbindung zu den Freunden ursprünglich auf der Liebe zur Mutter." Später konnte ich das Zitat mit meinem Namen, das schon aus der Zeit des Krieges stammen musste, nicht mehr finden und erkannte die Wahrnehmung als Halluzination. Dann eine Ausstellung mit Zeichnungen von Jünger, die mich faszinierten. Auch die Ausstellung dieser Zeichnungen befand sich in einem Warenhaus, das dem des Messegeländes im vergangenen Traum verwandt war. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0696 (1951-10-09 - Freiburg)Ein Traum, in dem Milieu und Personen merkwürdig gegeneinander verschoben waren. So schlich ich mich heimlich in Margunds Elternhaus, eine Treppe hoch an den Praxisräumen des Vaters vorbei, um dort -- Brigitte zu besuchen. Ich klopfte an die Tür, die die richtige zu sein schien, und hörte noch verschlafen: "Herein". Brigitte lag im Bett. Das Zimmer trug Züge von meiner und Giselas Göttinger Wohnungen. Das Problem war nun, wie ich so barfuss und zur unmöglichen Stunde in diesem strengen -- Margunds -- Elternhaus zu rechtfertigen war. Wir bedachten allerlei Versteckmöglichkeiten, die aber zu klein waren. Indessen schlich draussen vor dem Glasfenster in der oberen Türfüllung eine Gipsplastik -- Dante-ähnlich im Profil -- vorbei, die, wie ich danach sah, von Margunds Bruder getragen wurde, dessen Gesicht ich einen Augenblick wahrnahm. Ich drückte mich in die Ecke, doch er hatte mich schon gesehen und trat sehr heiter herein. Von ihm war keine Gefahr zu befürchten. Auch Ika spielte gesprächsweise hinein, doch als ob sie -- statt Brigittes -- in Preetz war und so, als wenn ich über sie mit Gisela spräche. (179 words)

Es war eine merkwürdige Versammlung. Zwei weibliche Polizistinnen in Zivil waren als Spitzel darunter, die, als sie von den Zivilisten erkannt wurden, von diesen geboxt wurden. Jeder Schlag hatte für mich als Zuschauer eine sexuelle Potenz. Die Mädchen hatten glänzende und eindringliche Augen. Schliesslich wurde ich von dem Kommissar herausgeführt, der mich ebenfalls wie einen Privatdetektiv aushorchen wollte. Erwachen bei den Überlegungen der Antwort. (90 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0698 (1951-10-09 - Freiburg)Gisela hatte mir von einer Ausführung des hiesigen Theaters -- wir leben irgendwo in der Gegend von Plön bis Eutin -- und der hiesigen Musikhochschule (Scheck) -- in Kassel erzählt. Ich liege morgens noch im Bett und sehe sie plötzlich schon zur Abreise bereit in der Bahn am Fenster stehen. Sie hat einen breitkrempigen Wiener Hut auf -- oder wie vom Balkan -- und lange, glattt bis auf die Schulter fallende Haare. Ich winke ihr und will mich erheben, als schon der Zug zu rollen beginnt. Müde und noch wie vom Schlaf gelähmt ziehe ich mich mit äusserster Anstrengung hoch und erhebe mit eben solcher Mühe den noch schlafenden Arm, um mit einem eben aufgegriffenen weitmaschig beschriebenen Papier, wie sie in meiner Stube liegen, zu winken, bis der letzte Wagen des Zuges über der Böschung verschwindet. Einem kleinem Jungen, der mich in meinem Nachthemd komisch findet, drohe ich scherzhaft mit dem Finger. Das Bild der wegfahrenden Gisela mit den langen Haaren beschäftigte mich noch lange im Erwachen, bis ich gänzlich in die Wirklichkeit zurückfand. (174 words)

Sein Knurren ist freundlich gemeint, doch habe ich Angst, er könnte trotzdem zuschnappen, wenn ich mit dem Fuss über ihn wegtrete. Ich warte darum, bis die Frau ihn hat aufstehen lassen. Dann ist da noch ein Jagdhund mit Schlappohren, den ich als den meinen, oder der Familie zugehörig erkenne, bei der ich lebe. Er springt mich freundlich an und folgt mir, die Hand fest zwischen seine Kiefer genommen, doch so, dass er nicht beisst, sondern nur die Hand fest zwischen den fleischigen Teilen hält. (112 words)

Gedichte an der Wand, die sich in rührender Weise mit seinen und meinen Lieben beschäftigen, nach dem Schema des Verzichts und neuer Hoffnung. Eines von ihnen, das mich betrifft, will ich auslöschen, weil es mich ärgert. Es ist aber in einer sehr anständigen Schrift geschrieben und von sehr gekonnten Zeichnungen, die farbig sind, begleitet, etwa im Stile Cézannes. Unter den Zeichnungen steht die Urheberschaft "Ich bin's J.S.B." (70 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0703 (1951-10-16 - Freiburg)Ich kam mit Franz vom Bahnhof. Wir unterhielten uns über Gisela in einer Atmosphäre tiefen Einverständnisses, doch nicht auf Grund eines Vertrages, sondern auf Grund von Freundschaft. Auch duzten wir uns. Er sagte: "Ich muss hier noch mal nach jemandem gucken, Du kannst schon mal gehen und Zigaretten holen." Wir einigten uns über die Marke, dann ging ich. Doch traumverloren kam ich zuerst in die Post. Ich kehrte sofort um und fürchtete, nun Franz zu verfehlen. Ich pfiff darum leise das Thema aus dem 1. Satz des Beethoven-Konzertes, bekam aber sofort Antwort. Unterwegs sah ich einige Tierplastiken, die ein Antiquar auf der Strasse ausgestellt hatte und von denen ich eine stark stilisierte zu kaufen dachte. Sie hatte die Farbe eines schwarzen Kiesels und die Formen sehr eleganter Flutlinien, wie sie das Meer auf einem Steine einschleift. (136 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0704 (1951-10-17 - Freiburg)Kein Friedhof, kein Direktor, kein Regisseur: Strassenbahnhaltestelle. König. Diese Worte standen auf einer Tafel in dem Gartengelände hinter unserem Haus in Schwerin, dicht am Franzosenweg, in schwarzer Schrift auf weissem Grunde. Ich wusste, dass Gisela und ihre Freunde das im Spass getan hatten. Sie hatten auf einen Wegweiser die ersten drei Worte durch diese drei "Keine" ersetzt. Das einsame, ein wenig verwahrloste Vorstadt-Gartengelände sah so aus, dass man dort in der Nähe ein Atelier oder einen Friedhof vermuten könnte. Indessen früher hatte es an der Stelle überhaupt keinen Wegweiser gegeben. -- Dem Traum heute Nacht gingen noch andere Szenen voran: Ich wohnte wieder in unserem alten Kinderzimmer, das später die Familie Tosch bezogen hatte. Ich ging in das gegenüber liegende Klosett, das in einem Holzverschlag unter der Bodentreppe angebracht war -- doch der Raum war viel grösser, anstatt des alten wackeligen Beckens standen dort viele weisse Waschwannen und Becken verschiedenster Art mit schwellenden weissen Böschungen und blitzenden Hähnen. Das Klosett war als eines unter ihnen kaum zu finden, es brannte nur ein rotes Notlicht, viele Schalter waren an der Wand, und doch mit keinem konnte man ein Licht entzünden. Draussen flüsterte die Familie T., weil ich in ihr Allerheiligstes eingedrungen war. Der Raum wirkte wie eine Kultstätte, und ich verliess ihn eingeschüchtert, ehe ich mich gesetzt hatte. -- Eine andere Traumszene, an die dann jene mit dem Wegweiser anschloss: Ich lief den einsamen Gartenweg hinab, nur noch mit einem weissen Bademantel bekleidet, und legte mich ins Gras, die Beine entblössend, damit sie von der noch warmen Herbstsonne beschienen würden. Doch schloss ich den Spalt des Mantels so weit wieder, dass die Scham bedeckt war. Dann gab ich mich der Wärme der Sonne hin. Ich hörte ein Freudengeheul von Gesine und ihren Freundinnen, die im Spiel den Weg hinunter gelaufen kamen. Ich veränderte meine Lage jedoch nicht. (306 words)

Der stieg von da hinab." - Zweiter Traum: Abends Traum kurz nach dem Einschlafen: Ein Mann wollte mir den Kopf zwischen die Tür einklemmen. Ich sagte: "Sie sind ja wahnsinnig",und schützte den Kopf mit den erhobenen Händen. Ich mochte sein Gesicht nicht antasten, obwohl es mir mit den Händen greifbar war. Dann rief ich die Leute hinter mir um Hilfe an mit den Worten: "He, helft mir doch", da er nicht nachliess, und wachte mit wahnsinniger Angst auf und starkem Herzklopfen, den Kopf zwischen die Arme eingeklemmt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0706 (1951-10-19 - Freiburg)Traum von Elisabeth Baumgarten. Ich hatte den Ziehwagen für sie an die Strassenkante gestellt und ging fort, als sie noch etwa drei Meter von dem Wagen entfernt war. Er geriet auf dem leicht abfallenden Gelände ins Rollen, und sie konnte ihn vor Schreck nicht aufhalten, lief jedoch entsetzt neben ihm her. Der Wagen entschwand mitten im Verkehr. Ein grosses Lastauto und ein Anhänger mit einer Art Deichsel fuhren ineinander. Ich fürchtete, der Baumgärtnerin sei etwas zugestossen und lief hinterher, sah sie jedoch jenseits der Kreuzung am Strassenrand stehen. Die Leute zogen gerade die Fahrzeuge auseinander, die fast unversehrt geblieben waren. Nur von dem Ziehwagen, der ein wenig abseits stand, waren ein Rad und die Deichsel zertrümmert. Ich dachte nach dem Erwachen noch lange über die Schuldfrage nach. Elisabeth Baumgarten, der ich den Traum erzählte, schrieb mir die Schuld zu. (139 words)

Dann wieder war ich im Urwald bei wilden Tieren, die ich erlegen musste. Ein Löwe, vor dem ich mich auf einen Baum zu retten suchte, um dann einen Stein auf ihn herabzuwerfen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0718 (1951-11-01 - Freiburg)Traum von Handschuhen. Ich habe mehrere Paare, darunter drei lederne (die übrigens den dreien gleichen, die ich besitze) an mich genommen in einem grossen Baukomplex von Räumen und Gängen, der wie ein abgeschlossenes Barackenlager oder das ausgedehnte Innere eines Schiffsbaus ist. In dem Kasten, in dem ich die Handschuhe habe, sind auch noch leinene, in weissen, roten und bunten Farben (wie Dreieckbadehosen). Es findet nun unter der Mannschaft anscheinend eine Art Handschuhverteilung statt. Eine Frau entdeckt mich mit einem Kasten in einem Gang und sagt: "Ah, da sind ja die Handschuhe, die uns gerade noch fehlen für den Soundso und den Soundso und so weiter, die noch keine haben." Sie geht noch einmal fort, und diesen Moment benutze ich, um den Kasten zu ergreifen und in Windeseile durch eine Tür, die glücklicherweise offen ist, mit dem Kasten unter dem Arm aus dem Lager zu entweichen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0719 (1951-11-02 - Freiburg)Traum von Brigitte. Folgende Vorgeschichte: Beim Bäcker. Eine Frau kauft Kuchen und eine Tasse Kaffee und dann -- einen kleinen Flügel. Dieser wird nun geschoben durch einen eigentlich unbestimmten Raum -- wie auf einer Bühne. Das heisst: Eigentlich soll der Transport erst beginnen. Alles wird gut geschlossen. Mein Vater ordnet die letzten Handgriffe an. Aber dann liegt plötzlich ein Mann auf dem Bauch auf dem Flügel, um noch etwas zu ändern. Ich finde es unerhört. Er zieht irgendwo einen Hebel heraus. Der Flügel wird gespielt, aber er klingt nun -- durch die Verstellung des Hebels -- wie eine Orgel. Zunächst Melodien im Stile von Bach, die dann in weichere, romantische Formen übergleiten. Ich sehe lange, blonde Haare der Spielerin, oben hinter dem Flügel hin und her wehen, und den Kopf, der im Takt geworfen wird. Dann erkenne ich Brigitte. Erwachen. (140 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0721 (1951-11-04 - Freiburg)Traum von einem indischen Gottesdienst und vom theologischen Seminar, wo ich die Bibliotheken durchstöberte. Doch der Direktor des Seminars (Wolf) erkannte mich nicht mehr. In einer vorhergegangenen Szene war es übrigens das Musikwissenschaftliche Seminar, wo ich altes Notenpapier für Giselas Vater suchte, in dessen Haus ich davor zum Essen -- dort nur halb geduldet -- gewesen war. Der indische Gottesdienst war in einer modernisierten, aber ganz indischen Kirche. Man musste sich bis auf eine Dreieckshose entkleiden.- Ich trug eine solche aus dem gelben Stoff, den ich mir für ein Halstuch kaufte. Die Beter mussten auf dem Boden auf den Knien entlang rutschen. Dafür gab es eigentlich kleine Rollwägelchen, die hier aber fehlten. Vor dem Gottesdienst wurde zwanglos geplaudert, auch Schokolade gegessen. Ich begrüsste Bekannte, so auch den jungen Kai und Ingemarie und ihren Mann, deren Hände ich versehentlich auf einmal ergriff. (141 words)

Ich bewunderte die Fülle der Produktion. (40 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0724 (1951-11-15 - Freiburg)Traum von einem Kamel, das mich liebkoste. Es war in einer Strasse, in der eine Kolonne von Kamelen mit kleinen Schritten, die sich zuweilen in die Lüfte hoben, fortzog. Vorher von einer ganz modernen Strassenbahn, die bis Paris oder Italien fahren sollte. Sie wurde gewendet, zwar so, dass dabei die Vorderräder aus den Schienen herausliefen und in grossem Schwung der ganze Wagen umschwang, um dann in die Schienen zurückzuspringen. Ich stand in dem Raum, der durch diesen Schwung gefährdet war, flüchtete mich bis an eine Hausecke, vor der aber der Wagen mich getroffen hätte, wenn er sich ganz aus den Schienen gelöst hätte. Das Kamel spielte übrigens, bevor es mich liebkoste, mit dem Gesicht eines kleinen Jungen. Das Tier war in seiner Grösse schön und stolz, erregend und zugleich milde -- der übliche Sinn von "Kamel" schien in dem Traum ausgeschaltet, wie wir ja überhaupt im Traum dem Eigentlichen der Tiere näher sind als im Schimpfwort.

Ein Mann knallte mit der Peitsche und machte meine Pferde wild, so dass sie über einen kleinen Zaun sprangen. Ich zog sie im letzten Moment zurück, ehe sich der Wagen dort verfing, so dass sie den Sprung gleichsam rückwärts wiederholten und der Wagen rückwärts lief. Der Mann indessen knallte weiter mit der Peitsche, obwohl ich ihm zurief, er solle es lassen. (74 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0730 (1951-11-26 - Freiburg)Ein Wolf ist geschlachtet, offenbar zur Fütterung der Menschen und Tiere. Ich trage ihn im Rucksack und begegne drei Windhunden, die sofort das Fleisch gewittert haben und mich anfallen wollen. Zu meinem Glück sind sie an Leinen festgebunden und ich kann aus ihrem Bannkreis fliehen, aber ich kann nun die Strasse nicht zu Ende gehen, da der Radius der Leinen, an denen die Hunde laufen, die Strasse fast bis an die Mauer bestreicht. In dem schmalen freien Streifen sehe ich gerade, wie eine ältere Frau mit drei schwarzen Dackeln sich versucht durchzudrücken. Sie fallen dabei auf die Seite, es gibt ein Durcheinander, die Windhunde reissen sich los und werden zunächst von der Frau mit den Dackeln abgewehrt und beschäftigt. Ich benutze die Gelegenheit und stürze in der Richtung meines Weges durch den ehemaligen Bannkreis der Hunde fort, doch diese, die nun frei sind, haben mich bald eingeholt. Ich nehme den schweren Rucksack (mit dem toten Wolf) ab und bin im Begriffe, ihn um mich zu schleudern, zur Abwehr der Hunde. Erwachen, weil meine Haustürglocke schellt. Der Briefträger brachte mir einen Traum von Ika über das Totenreich. Nun fällt mir eine weitere, vorhergehenden Szene aus meinem Traum ein: Ich will per Anhalter fahren und verlasse dafür das Stadtzentrum zunächst in der Strassenbahn. Ich setze mich neben den Fahrer, zuweilen mit den Beinen zwischen seine Hebel kommend. Lege meinen Rucksack ab und trinke aus meiner Tasse (einer grossen Teetasse, die ich dann wieder im Rucksack verstaue). Der Fahrer nickt zuweilen ein, während die Bahn auf den Schienen sicher weiterrollt. Die Autos weichen ihr von selber aus. Er erzählt im Traum -- vom Totenreich (dieser Traum war aber bevor ich Ikas Brief bekam). Ich höre seine Worte und denke, dass es merkwürdig sein müsse, wenn es jetzt einen Zusammenstoss geben würde und die Worte würden Wirklichkeit. Diese Vorstellung hat etwas fast Beruhigendes.

Dort ein stattlicher Rehbock, der schliesslich bis zu mir kommt und das Kind liebhat. Ich halte dabei die Hand vor sein Geweih, damit kein Schaden entsteht. Andere Szene: Ich gehe über einen Schulplatz, wo die Kinder Kugel stossen und dauernd fast meinen Kopf treffen. Andere Szene: Ich betrachte mit anderen, auch mehreren Mädchen, Aktbilder, darunter eines, in dem eine Frau im Wasser steht, aus dem nur Kopf und Becken und der gebeugte Rücken in wunderbarer Plastik hervorragen, während das Wasser leise spielt. Man sieht die Bewegung genau. Moderne Architektur und Fahrzeuge in der Umgebung. Andere Bilder von sehr archaischer Schönheit, fast ägyptischem Charakter. (145 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0734 (1951-11-30 - Freiburg)Neueinzug in ein grosses Zimmer mit breiter und tiefgehender Fensterfront, vor die mehrfach durchsichtige Gardinen gezogen werden, zur Abschirmung von Licht und Einblick. Ich finde Blumen und Früchte im Zimmer vor. Die Atmosphäre ist freundlich, geräumig und patrizisch. Ich beginne, mich zu entkleiden, ziehe noch während dessen die Gardinen vor und lege mich noch mit verhülltem Oberkörper, sonst entkleidet, auf das Bett. Ich höre ein Kichern, sehe ein zweites Bett hinter dem meinen und spüre die Anwesenheit von zwei Mädchen in dem halbdunklen Raum. Die eine, deren blonde Haare ich erblicke, ziehe ich zu mir, küsse sie, wobei ihre Lippen die meinen wie ein Rüssel ergreifen, und werfe mich über sie. Sie beginnt, sich hinzugeben, hält sich aber zugleich zurück mit den Worten: "Ich würde vorsichtig sein, bei einem ganz fremden Menschen: Man kann nie wissen, ob er krank ist." Ich sehe dann das Gesicht, das sehr derb und etwas putig wirkt, mit sinnlich aufgewölbten Lippen. Ich erwache enttäuscht über die Banalität des Erlebens in diesem schönen Zimmer. Im Laufe der Besinnung über den Traum tritt jedoch die Schönheit des Zimmers wieder deutlich hervor, das Erlebnis beginnt, sich als ein eigentlich fremdes von dem Traum abzutrennen. Ich habe das Gefühl, als wenn zwei Träume kombiniert seien. (206 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0740 (1951-12-05 - Freiburg)Traum von einer geplanten Brückensprengung, die ich entdeckte, und im letzten Moment verriet -- schweren Herzens, da mir der Rebell, der Maler, zwar verfeindet, aber nicht ferne war. Ein grosser technischer Apparat war mit der Abwendung der Sprengung verbunden. Es handelte sich um eine Brücke, die wie eine Zugbrücke in eine Art Schloss oder Burg führte, in dem ich auch lebte (von der Grösse und Modernität etwa einer Rheinbrücke), über die der Bundeskanzler am Tage ihrer Einweihung mit einem modernen Auto fahren sollte. Die ganzen technischen Einzelheiten spielten nun um die Abwendung dieser Sprengung. Dazu kam ein riesiger Stab ins Haus, der aber nicht lückenlos arbeitete, so dass ich ihn dauernd überwachen musste, und ausserdem Militär. Die Fahrt des Kanzlers über die Brücke ist ein Wagnis -- mit grosser Spannung erwartet und tapfer durchgeführt. Man warf Staniolsilber aus der Luft ab, um eine etwaige Fernzündung durch elektrische Strahlungen zu verhindern. Die Überfahrt gelang. (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0745 (1951-12-09 - Freiburg)Ich schaue aus einem Zug auf das Schienengewirr in dem Rangiergelände einer grossen Stadt. Plötzlich sehe ich Rauchwolken aufsteigen: Irgendwo in einem Zug brennt es. Dann sieht man flüssiges Feuer über die Schienen rollen, unerbittlich sich ausbreitend. Zug um Zug, Gebäude um Gebäude müssen geräumt werden. Autos gehen in Flammen auf. Alles ist unheimlich und unverständlich. Der Flammenbereich nähert sich. Ich sehe einen französischen Soldaten, der mit einem Hammerschlag auf die Schienen die jeweilige Grenze angibt und dann die Menschen aus der Gefahr treibt. Jetzt ertönt der Hammerschlag auf der Schiene unter unserem Zuge. Dann die Austreibung. Mit äusserster Mühe nur gelingt es mir, so schnell zu laufen wie die Gefahr erfordert. Neben mir ein kleiner Junge, den ich am Arm packe und mitziehe. Später merke ich, dass es ein alter Mann ist. (133 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0747 (1951-12-10 - Freiburg)Ein Traumbild der letzten Nacht fiel mir erst heute in Gespräch wieder ein. Ricarda hatte im Gespräch von einem sehr neuen amerikanischen Wagen mit automatischer Gangschaltung erzählt, den sie mit ihrer Mutter fuhr. Diesen Wagen sah ich im Traum, elfenbeinfarben, doch von alter Konstruktion, von steilen und gradlinigen Formen, wie sehr frühe Wagen. Er erhöhte allmählich seine Geschwindigkeit, und jedes Mal, wenn diese eine bestimmte Grenzen überschritten hatte, die eigentlich eine neue Schaltung verlangt hätte, setzte die automatische Schaltung und trieb dabei einen grossen kompakten Hebel seitlich aus dem Wagen heraus, dessen Hervortreten den Vorgang sichtbar machte. Die allmähliche Beschleunigung der Geschwindigkeit wirkte dabei ähnlich zügig und unwirklich wie die des grossen Rolls Noir (Orphée) beim Einfahren in die Zone des Totenreiches. (122 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0748 (1951-12-10 - Freiburg)Ich blieb den Vormittag über in meinem Bett, wie in einem warmen Bade, umgeben von einer Fülle von Traumbildern, die sich jedoch nicht mehr fassen lassen, und deren Reiz in der Konsistenzlosigkeit und im tieferen Einverständnis lag. Sie hatten alle etwas Märchenhaftes und zugleich Ernstes und nahe am Schaudern wohnendes wie die Opern von Mozart. Das Vergessen gehörte zu ihrem Wesen. (61 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0749 (1951-12-11 - Freiburg)Traum aus dem Elternhaus. Der See hatte das gesamte Gartengelände überschwemmt, so dass das Haus nun direkt am Wasser stand. Ich empfand das als ungeheuer beglückend. Der Wind kräuselte und färbte das Wasser. Ein schmaler Streifen hinter dem Haus war in der Weise einer barocken Gartenanlage befestigt. Alles war durchzogen von Heiterkeit. (52 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0750 (1951-12-11 - Freiburg)Andere Träume heute Nacht: Ich ging durch ein unbekanntes Gelände, das aber traummässig mit dem Schweriner Traum zusammenhing, zunächst durch eine fremde Stadt, dann durch ihr leicht bergiges, lehmartiges Vorgelände. Jungens rollten und schmissen mit Steinen, vor denen man sich vorsehen musste. Es waren zum Teil grosse Brocken. Doch da ich sie kannte, liess ich sie. Schliesslich aber, als auch fremde nach mir zielten, durch die ich in die Gefahr des Getroffenwerdens kam, knöpfte ich sie mir vor und stellte sie zur Rede. Später Rückweg in die Stadt, wobei ich mich in eine Sackgasse, eigentlich eine Kette von Höfen, festlief. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0751 (1951-12-15 - Freiburg)Abends: Als eben eine erleuchtete Strassenbahn durch den schwarzen Raum meiner dunklen Fenster fuhr, schienen Traumbilder der letzten Nacht wieder vorbeizuhuschen. Eines, das ich fassen wollte, und das sich heute morgen schon entzog, liess sich jedoch nicht fixieren. Das andere: Kinder (kleine Mädchen), die auch im Winter im Schnee barfuss und mit nackendem Oberkörper spielten. Ich musste, als ich sie sah, mir die Eltern vorstellen, die mir dabei, obwohl ich sie nicht kannte, in ihrer Leidenschaftlichkeit sichtbar schienen. - Von meinem eigenen zweiten Traumbild weiss ich nur noch dieses, dass ein merkwürdiges Changieren darin war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0752 (1951-12-16 - Freiburg)Traumbild: Ein nackter Radfahrer am Franzosenweg (Uferstrasse in Schwerin). Er nutzt die wenigen Strahlen der Wintersonne. Anderes Traumbild: Ich gehe durch ein grosses Zimmer auf eine Gruppe zu, die ich durch ein gebogenes Eckfenster sehe, das von der Decke bis zum Boden reicht. Ich suche dann eine Klappe, die ich öffne, um mit ihnen zu sprechen. Anderes Traumbild: Singen in einem kirchlichen Raum: Vor dem Fenster erscheint ein Amerikaner, der den Raum als Unterkunft beschlagnahmen will. Er ergreift eine Monstranz, um mit Kreide die Beschlagnahme des Raumes darauf zu schreiben. Der schwarz gekleidete Pfarrer (der die Züge des hiesigen Studentenpfarres trägt) nimmt sie ihm langsam wieder weg. (107 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0754 (1951-12-18 - Freiburg)Traum von einem tollwütigen Hunde, der unter meinen Mantel kriechen will, um mich zu beissen. Ich trete die Säume meines Mantels fest mit den Füssen auf den Boden, so dass ein geschlossener Raum entsteht. Schliesslich ist der Hund aber doch eingedrungen. Ich spüre ihn zwischen den Schenkeln emporschnellen und packe im letzten Moment durch das Kleid seinen Kopf und würge ihn. Dann wird er in einen Käfig gesperrt, den ich fest zu Boden drücke, da er keinen Boden hat und der Hund immer wieder versucht, einzelne Glieder, Kopf, Schwanz und Pfoten darunter heraus zu schieben, um sich zu befreien. Bei alledem bin ich mir der ungeheuren Gefahr jedes einzelnen Bisses bewusst. Dann ein Wechsel der Situation: Aus der Ansteckungsgefahr der Tollwut ist die der Schlafkrankheit geworden -- jedoch wie jene übertragbar durch den Biss. Ein Kind ist bereits infiziert. Gemeinsam mit der Mutter und einem hilfsbereiten Mann bringen wir es in einen Eisenbahnwagen. Das Einsteigen gelingt ihnen noch im letzten Moment. Überlegungen über eine mir bevorstehende Reise nach Lübeck (zu Tante Tabitha) spielen in diese Szene hinein, so ob ich nicht auf dem Bahnsteig bleiben und schwarz fahren soll. Ich verlasse dann aber auf einem schmalen Nebenweg den Bahnsteig (einer kleinen Landstation), wobei ich mich zunächst im Garten des Bahnwärters verlaufe, dann aber auf eine Strasse gelange und schliesslich die anderen Glieder der Familie und Emmi wiederfinde. Wir sprechen über die gefährliche Krankheit und ihre Übertragungsmittel. Nicht das Sich-Hüten vor dem Biss des Hundes genügt, sondern schon ein Kuss kann die Krankheit übertragen, wenn ein Mensch die Bazillen der Krankheit trägt. Der Traum ging dann weiter: Ich fuhr mit einem Auto, um aus dem vor der Schlafkrankheit befallenen Gebiet zu entrinnen, wurde indessen selber müde, als es dunkelte, konnte das Licht nicht einschalten und den Bremshebel nicht finden. Dann kam ich durch eine grosse Stadt, in der die Krankheit schon ausgebrochen war. Überall schwankten müde von ihr befallene Gestalten. Ich hatte noch eine gesunde Begleiterin, ich glaube Gisela, im Wagen, konnte aber von den Kranken niemand mitnehmen, da wir dann unweigerlich verloren gewesen wären. Schliesslich hielt ich ausserhalb der Stadt an, lief einen kleinen gewundenen Pfad von der Strasse hinab und erwachte. (362 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0755 (1951-12-19 - Freiburg)Ich bin Maler. Als ich in mein Atelier zurückkomme, finde ich dort eine Menge von Menschen -- betrachtend -- von denen einer sich über ein umgefallenes Bild lehnt und es dabei verbiegt. Ich herrsche ihn an, es zu lassen, und als er nur lahm reagiert, schmeisse ich ihn wütend raus und ebenfalls alle anderen, die murren. Peinliche Stille bleibt um mich zurück. Auf der Fensterbank steht eine Fülle blühender Blumen, darunter wunderbar rosa Azaleen. Nächstes Traumbild: Spielt bei meinen Geschwistern. Emmi packt mir ein Lebensmittelpaket, das mit einer grossen Dose voller Zucker beginnt. Nächste Szene handelt von Gogarten und Bach (die miteinander versippt sind). Um Bach herum hat ein Rennen stattgefunden, bei dem Fahrräder von Motorrädern gezogen werden. Alle gleiten dabei und stürzen. Nur einer kommt ins Ziel, und der muss sein Fahrrad schieben und blutet von einer Hautabschürfung. Ich habe zunächst das Rennen gesehen, dann es Bach erzählt, der zu Gogarten geht -- diesmal ist es aber offenbar so, dass Gogarten es war, um den herum das Rennen ging. (170 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0756 (1951-12-23 - Freiburg)Zuerst auf dem Lande (wie in Roggow oder Wittmoldt) zur Arbeit und gleichzeitig Erholung, in einer Art Pavillon, gleichzeitig wie ein Château oder eine Bibliothek, wo ich vor einer Wand alte Aufzeichnungen von mir, die zugleich meine Arbeit in einem sehr umständlichen Stil betreffen, entziffere und entschlüssele. Einer der Landleute kommt vorbei und meint, ich habe mich noch schlecht erholt, ich sei noch zu mager. Die Schrift ist an die Wand gekritztelt wie in einem Aussichtspavillon, die Texte sind aber gleichzeitig von der Art, wie man sie in Bibliotheken liest, betreffen aber eine praktische, recht tangierende Arbeit, die ich wohl an dem Tempelchen zu leisten habe. Andere Szene: Nicolai Hartmann zu Besuch: Ich gebe ihm im dunklen Raum, Zimmer, einige Pinsel, damit er etwas, einen Traum oder ähnliches, für mich aufzeichnen kann. Er sucht sorgfältig den feinsten Pinsel heraus und zeichnet dann mit einer grossen Sicherheit. Ich habe davon vor allem noch eine diagonale Linie auf einer rechteckigen Fläche in Erinnerung. Die ganze Zeichnung hatte etwas geistig Konstruktives und zugleich den Gegebenheiten des Traumes Angenähertes. Dann sieht er durch das Fenster Professor Gerstel hereinkommen und wir beschliessen darum fortzugehen, in seine Wohnung, da er wohl vor ihm zu zeichnen befangen ist. Er borgt sich einen Hut von mir. Ich gebe ihm alle meine Hüte, zumeist von Vater geerbte, zur Wahl, rate ihm aber einen dunkelblauen, sehr breitkrempigen, den ich ihm scherzhaft mit den Worten gebe: "Ich möchte doch mal sehen, wie der Ihnen steht." Der ist ihm aber viel zu weit und er sieht darunter aus wie eine Figur aus einem englischen Film. Wir probieren dann noch andere Hüte, und er ist in allem diesen sehr geduldig und gütig, zugleich in einer souveränen Heiterkeit über das Spiel erhaben. Der braune Hut meines Vaters zum Beispiel, der ursprünglich einmal für mich gekauft wurde, steht ihm genau so wenig wie meinem Vater, meinem Bruder oder mir. Doch schliesslich finden wir etwas Passendes. Dritte Szene. Ich beschaue Bücher, die mir ein Papier- oder Holz-Händler gebracht hat. Er verkauft die Dinger zum Heizen, aber an einen seiner Kunden, so an einen alten Einsiedler, von dem er erzählt, liefert er die Bücher auch zum Lesen. Ich blättere zunächst in einer alten griechischen und hebräischen Textausgabe, in der anscheinend auch die griechischen Textausgaben der Tragödien enthalten sind -- wie ich später feststelle eine Art Journal, in dem man Verschiedenes gesammelt hat. Dann ein Buch mit Bildern, Stichen, zum Teil koloriert, aus Heidelberg. Das Buch mag aus der Zeit um die Jahrhundertwende stammen. Ich wundere mich, dass die Bilder so viel Stil beweisen. Bilder der Stadt und Bilder aus dem Studentenleben. So sieht man in einem alten Haus mit hölzernen verschalten Wänden nachts einen jungen Studenten zu einem blonden Mädchen gehen, die ihm nackt, nur leicht einen Mantel umgeworfen, über eine kleine Treppe herab entgegenkommt und ihm die Hand reicht. Ich denke an Marion, der das Mädchen gleicht, und wundere mich über die Ähnlichkeit in diesem alten Buch. (491 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0758 (1951-12-26 - Freiburg)Traumbilder: Eine Maske, mit leicht geöffnetem Mund. Wenn man sich ihr -- von oben sie betrachtend -- nähert, gibt es einen Moment, in dem sie plötzlich den Mund schliesst, doch so, dass nicht bei einer allmählichen Näherung die Öffnung des Mundes nur immer weniger zu sehen ist, bis sich die Lippen geschlossen zu haben scheinen, sondern so, dass in einem bestimmten Stadium, der Mund sich plötzlich und wie von der Maske ausgehend schliesst. Mich beschäftigt dieses Phänomen, das ich öfters wiederhole und auch einem anderen zeige. -- Zweites Traumbild: Ein Haus mit drei Balkonen übereinander, auf deren jedem eine trauernde Frau steht, bei deren Anblick -- von unten nach oben immer stärker werdend -- die Trauer in mir hochsteigt. Es ist ein Urbild der Trauer, in dessen Anblick ihr Vollzug liegt ohne Grund. Die Dreiheit und das Steigen des Blicks werden eine Einheit in dem Aufsteigen der Trauer, das in ihnen nicht mehr als Bild, sondern als es selbst verkörpert ist. -- Andere Traumszene: Ich sitze bei Marion -- und zwar neben ihr, auf dem Bettrand ihres Bruders. Sie ist erst zurück gekommen oder aufgewacht, und sagt zu mir: "Ich bitte dich, drei Monate nicht zu mir zu kommen." Da steigt die Trauer in mir hoch. (Doch ist dies Traumbild ein nachkommendes -- nicht dem Bild der Trauer -- oben -- vorausgehendes.) Andere Traumszene: Mein Bruder hat sich mit einer Fürstenberg befreundet. Wir stehen vor einem Bunker dieser Familie, der im Stil einer neuromanischen Kirche erbaut ist. Auch wird dort Gottesdienst abgehalten. Die Bewohner der Stadt finden dieses Bauwerk schön und lassen sich nicht belehren. (265 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0759 (1951-12-27 - Freiburg)Traum von Ricarda -- bis zu innigsten und leiblichen Vereinigung. (Es geschieht zum ersten Mal, dass ich von solchen Dingen unverstellt und ohne Bild geträumt habe). Schön war das Spiel mit den Schenkeln und Hüften und voll tiefen Einverständnisses, jenes Einverständnisses, das sich plötzlich nach anfänglichen Widerstand unserer bemächtigt. So war es beglückend, das hellbraune wollene Hemd von der Haut zu streifen, die es locker umschlossen hatte. Zunächst bewegten wir uns im Bereich des Gespräches, das sich jedoch plötzlich in Widerstände verstrickte, und als sie anfing, mich zu ärgern und zu hänseln, schwieg ich, obwohl die Trauer bis zum Halse in mir hochstieg, dann schlug ich ihr rechts und links eine Ohrfeige und darin leitete sich die Umarmung ein. Der Traum war begleitet von einem merkwürdigen Nachspiel: Als ich den Vorhang zurückschlug, sass dort Katharina Gerstel, die Malerin, die aus irgend einem Grunde wegen eines Zwistes, aus der elterlichen Wohnung fortgelaufen war und bei uns eine Zuflucht gesucht hatte. Sie war schweigend hinter dem Vorhang sitzen geblieben. Auch mein Bruder spielte in den Traum hinein, doch wohl in der vorausgegangen Szene, die mir nicht mehr erinnerlich ist. (187 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0761 (1951-12-30 - Frankfurt a.M.)Gespräche mit Elisabeth Baumgarten über Giselas Eltern, bei dem Elisabeth Baumgarten die Eltern gegen alles, das ich einwandte, verteidigte. So sagte ich, dass die Mutter vieles, um den Vater zu schonen, täte, dass der Vater von sich aus nie tun würde, und dass dadurch zuweilen ein Circulus vitiosus entstünde. Elisabeth Baumgarten fand das sehr natürlich und verteidigte vor allem die Mutter. Elisabeth Baumgarten ist von allen Menschen, die ich kenne, diejenige, der ich das sicherste und tiefste Urteil über Menschen zutraue. Auch in dem Traum dürfte sie diese Rolle spielen. Gestern begab ich mich auf Ikas Brief und meinen Traum hin auf die Reise. Gelangte dabei zunächst bis Frankfurt, wo ich bei Gisela Haas und Michel übernachtete. (Gisela Haas, meine Cousine). Wuppertal ist das Ziel meiner Reise, wo ich Ika besuchen und auch Gisela und ihre Eltern sehen will. (139 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0762 (1951-12-30 - Frankfurt a.M.)Ich wohne in Michels Haus, wo ich krank im Bett liege. Er besucht mich am Bett, zusammen mit einem Arzt, der die Züge von Elisabeth Baumgartens Vater trägt (von dem Gymnasialprofessor in Freiburg, von dem ich ein Bild bei ihr sah und über den ich viel von ihr hörte). Der Arzt zeigt mir in einem Notizbuch eine Art Rorschachtest, jedoch nur aus leuchtend roter Tinte, den er mit mir gemacht hat und in den er die Gestalten, die ich gedeutet habe, eingezeichnet hat. Es sind nackte Figuren im Stil Michelangelos. Ich kann mich zunächst nicht erinnern, vor allem nicht an etwas, das ich auch in seiner Zeichnung nicht wiedererkenne, wohl eine Mädchengestalt, denn ich erkenne die Haare. Später blättere ich heimlich in dem Buch zurück auf die Deutungen anderer Patienten. Es sind primitive Gestalten (im Stile der Negerplastiken, die ich in Volksdorf im Hause von Maetzels sah). Andere Szene: Ein Spaziergang mit Emmi auf der Strasse: Wir überholen den Psychotherapeuten Rommelsbacher und einige andere, die über den Pfister-Test (Farbpyramidentest nach Heiss) sprechen. Ich höre im Vorbeigehen gerade das Bruchstück eines Satzes: "...viel Violett..". Emmi, die zwischen mir und dem Therapeuten geht, wechselt bei diesem Satz auf meine andere Seite über. Ich sage: "...merkwürdig, wo Du doch gerade so viel Violett gelegt hast!" (Anmerkung: Ich habe mit Emmi nie diesen Test gemacht). Andere Szene: Ich wasche mich in meinem Zimmer in Michels Haus vor dem offenen Fenster. Zudringliche Leute kommen herein, um die Glyzinie am Haus zu pflücken. (247 words)

Ich ziehe die Beine hoch und es beleckt meine Unterschenkel. Dann kommt eine Polizeikommission und sucht nach dem Reiter. Er liegt ganz dicht bei uns hinter einer Böschung an der kleinen Kurve, ganz von Lehm bespritzt und das Hemd von Blut verklebt.

Ikas Bewegungen waren von einer besonderen Kraft des Zupackens und ihre Augen hatten eine fast zerschneidende Leuchtkraft. Die Beckerin schmeckte wie Ricarda und küsste wie eine sich Betrinkende. In allem diesem war eine Stärke und Intensität des Glücks, wie ich sie wohl noch nie so geträumt habe. (89 words)

Ich überschwemme beim Waschen den Fussboden, so dass ich ein Durchlecken des Wassers fürchten muss, das sich sofort in zwei Richtungen schnell fliessend ausbreitet. Ich laufe mit schon entblösstem Oberkörper über den Flur, um den Feudel zu holen, und beginne aufzuwischen. Dabei wandelt sich die Szene: Die Fläche, auf der ich wische, ist beschrieben mit dem Offizierspatent meines Vaters (oder einer ähnlichen Schrift). Statt des Auftrocknens ist es eine radierende Bewegung. Das so Ausgelöschte will ich nachher wieder hinschreiben, doch plötzlich fällt mir ein, dass ich den Text nicht auswendig gelernt habe. Auch setze ich mir eine Grenze, bis zu der ich nur wischen will -- so wie man beim Puddingessen zuweilen die Felder einteilt oder beim Rasieren methodisch vorgeht. Hiernach kommt erst die Szene mit dem Assistenten, doch so, dass noch Strassenträume dazwischen liegen, in denen es, glaube ich, um die Wohnung eines Philosophen, wohl die Gestalt Heideggers geht.

Später eine andere Szene. Zwei Schäferhunde, von denen der eine ihr gehört, der andere irgend einem Fremden. Die Hunde werden aufeinander aufmerksam und schiessen, als der Fremde seinen loslässt, aufeinander los. Doch verhindert Ina die Begegnung, indem sie im letzten Moment ihren Hund mit dem Bein in die Luft hebt, so dass der ganze Hund mit seinem Leib auf ihrem waagerecht erhobenen Schienbein ruht und nur die vier Hundebeine herunterhängen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0783 (1952-01-25 - Freiburg)Ich erhalte einen Musterungsbefehl, ausgestellt von einer polizeilichen Behörde, gehe aber nicht hin, da ich diese nicht, und im Augenblick überhaupt keine, zum Ausstellen solcher Befehle für berechtigt halte und in der Wiedereinführung der Wehrpflicht die Gefahr des Bürgerkrieges sehe. Andere Szene: Ich treffe die Beckerin, die aussieht, als ob sie schwanger wäre. Wir küssen uns, doch unterbricht sie eine engere Vereinigung: "Ich würde nichts anfangen, wozu wir jetzt nicht die Zeit haben, es zu Ende zu machen." Sie meint das ganz real. In dem Zimmer, in dem sie im Bett liegt, sind jetzt auch Mitglieder meiner Familie. Oben in einer zweiten Etage, die mit ihren Fenstern noch in den sehr hohen Raum hineinragt und mit einem einen Art Altar. In dieser oberen Etage sieht man die Gemusterten herauskommen und hereindrängen. Ich hatte eigentlich eine Karte schreiben wollen, dass ich dem Befehl nicht nachkommen würde, da ich ihn nicht für legitim ansehe, hatte das Schreiben aber unterlassen. Mein Bruder und meine Freunde fanden den Befehl so unbegründet, dass sie auch dies Schreiben für unnötig hielten. Mein Vater aber fragt enttäuscht: "Willst Du denn nicht Soldat werden?" und kann meine Gegengründe nicht verstehen. Dann eine Fahrt mit der Strassenbahn, zunächst mit meiner Cousine Dietlind, von der aber dann nur allgemein die Gestalt des blonden Mädchens übrigbleibt und die zugleich (wohl durch die Ähnlichkeit des Haarschnitts) wie eine Verwandlung von der Beckerin ins Blond erscheint. Die Strassenbahn fährt länger, als ich gedacht hatte, zwischen zwei Städten, nämlich zwischen Mannheim und Heidelberg und heisst O.L.G. Das Mädchen hat mein Fahrgeld bezahlt. Es sitzt über mir in einem Art Gebälk oder Dachstuhl. Die Bahn fährt sehr leicht und wiegend unter einem wunderbaren Viadukt dahin, das ich für ein altrömisches halte, zuweilen herrliche Ausblicke in eine etwas felsige verschneite Landschaft. Dann Ausstieg. Eintritt in eine Stadt, an deren Tor, etwas kitschig aufgemalt, in goldenen Buchstaben der Name Rostock steht -- ungefähr in der Wendung: "Nun aber doch Rostock". Man kommt sofort auf einen wunderbaren alten Klosterhof mit rötlichen Wänden, dann weiter in die Stadt hinein. In einem Heim oder einer Jugendherberge, zugleich öffentliches Rathaus oder ähnliches, in dem die Zugänge zu den verschiedenen Zimmern angezeigt sind, unter anderem auch zu Plato, treffe ich, wie in einer Herberge im Feldbett liegend, Ikas Bruder Ernst. Er ist nicht einverstanden mit meiner Rebellion gegen den Musterungsbefehl und versteht meine Gegengründe nicht. Schon die Gegenwart Platos in dieser Stadt weist aber auf geordnete Verhältnisse hin. Auf dem Hof des Gebäudes kommen mir viele neugebackene Soldaten entgegen, in feldgrauen Uniformen, fast alle bereits in silbernen Litzen und Sternen (Chargierte). Sie haben ihre alten Ränge aus dem letzten Kriege übernommen. Auf der Suche nach jemanden, dem ich mein Protestanliegen vorbringen kann, finde ich einen höflichen Mann, Kellner-artig im schwarzen Frack, der zu mir sagt: "Gehen Sie bitte dorthin auf Zimmer soundsoviel, dort können alle Studenten ihr Protestanliegen vorbringen".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0784 (1952-01-26 - Freiburg)Verwirrende Traumszenen, die ich lange bedachte. Es war schwer, sie in der Besinnung in ihre Reihenfolge zu ordnen, da die innere erregte Beteiligung noch zu stark war. Erste Szene handelt um eine Lehranalyse und spielt in einem Klinikgebiet. Es sind verschiedene Analytiker, weibliche und männliche, die als Analytiker in Frage kommen. Zunächst behandelt mich eine freundliche, aber wohl noch nicht sehr erfahrene junge Doktorin. Zuletzt ein Mann. Wir sprechen miteinander in einem kellerartigen Raum. Dann deutet er an, dass er mich nun untersuchen wolle -- anscheinend physisch. Ich solle doch einmal in die Klinik in die Station des Doktor Soundso gehen und mich auf ein Bett legen. Ich gehe in die Station durch eine Tür (Räumlichkeit wie in der Freiburger Nervenklinik, in der ich gestern einen Abort suchte, vor dem psychotherapeutischen Seminar, und ich hinterher mit Professor v. Hattingberg über die Möglichkeiten einer Lehranalyse, und wer sie machen könnte, sprach). In der Station liegt nur ein kleiner Junge, der mit dieses oder jenes Bett als frei bezeichnet. Doch immer, wenn wir näher zusehen, merken wir, dass es doch belegt ist (mit irgendwelchen Kleidungsstücken oder sonstigem von seinem Besitzer). Andere Szene: Ich trage eine kleine schwarze Katze auf dem Arm, die ich sehr liebe. Sie beisst mich ein wenig mit den kleinen Zähnchen im Spiel in den Finger. Ich liess schnell die Katze abspringen und ins Haus laufen. Auf einer Freitreppe, die wohl in ein Landschloss führte (ähnlich Roggow) sahen wir einen braun-gelben Hund herankommen, der die Katze hasste und ihr zu Leibe wollte. Der Hund wandte sich nun mir zu und biss mich in die Hand. Ich rief alle Leute auf der Treppe um Hilfe an, während ich langsam hinaufstieg, aber alle waren schweigend oder achselzuckend und halfen mir nicht, während der Hund fest meine Hand im Gebiss hielt -- dieser Vorgang war jedoch (wie immer in dieser Traumszene) nicht schmerzhaft, sondern nur von sehr grosser Angst begleitet. Andere Szene: In Roggow. Der Herr des Hauses trägt jedoch zugleich die Züge von Professor Gerstel, dem Bildhauer. Ich habe einen Brief von Christian v. Ferber bekommen, der in der Ostzone lebt. Der Herr des Hauses sagt, ich solle ihm nicht viel über die Zustände in Roggow schreiben. Er macht eine Art Geheimnis darum. Eine politische Bedrohlichkeit scheint im Spiel zu sein. Nächste Szene: Ich spiele jetzt Christians Rolle. Bin im Osten. Gehe in den Wald (auch er hatte mir in dem Brief, den ich vorher im Traum von ihm erhielt, von einem Spaziergang in den Wald geschrieben, doch schien er ganz sorglos zu sein, während ich jetzt Angst hatte. Rechts und links sah ich Häuser (Katen) im Wald.) So durfte ich die Situation noch für ungefährlich halten. Ein altmodisches Auto kam mir entgegen. Der Mann am Steuer erhob hinter dem Fenster eine Pistole gegen mich. Ich streckte den Zeigefinger gegen ihn, genau auf die Mündung seiner Pistole aus, und sah ihm scharf in die Augen, um ihn zu hypnotisieren. So konnte er nicht abdrücken. Dieser Zustand schien sich Minutenlang auszudehnen, und der Bann stand jeden Augenblick in Gefahr, zusammenzubrechen. Schliesslich gab der Mann es auf und fuhr mit dem Auto langsam weiter. In diesem Augenblick löste sich auch in mir der Bann, und ich bedrohte ihn wütend mit einem Nagel (einem grossen Mauernagel), den auch er schon vorher gegen mich erhoben hatte. Es kam zu einem Handgemenge. Hier schloss sich wohl eine Ringkampfszene an, die mich in ihrer Eleganz beglückte. Ich bekam darin jene Griffe demonstriert, in denen man zunächst den Anderen die Überhand bekommen lässt, um ihn dann in einem grossen Salto auf den Rücken zu werfen. Ich genoss den Flug dieses Saltos und die Exaktheit und Zügigkeit der körperlichen Berührung. (611 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0785 (1952-01-27 - Freiburg)Morgens Traum von einer Fahrt durch Breisach. Die Stadt lag in diesem Traum direkter am Kaiserstuhl, als am Tage und überragte mit ihren Dächern dessen Gipfel. Freiburg war in der Ferne zu sehen. Aus dem Rückfenster des fahrenden Zuges oder Strassenwagens (vielleicht Ähnlichkeit mit der Schwebebahn in Wuppertal) sah ich auf dies zauberhaft unwirkliche Panorama so herab, dass ich zuweilen dachte, dies alles sei nur ein Film. Die Veränderung der Landschaft war so, wie sie auf den phantastischen Landschaftsbildern und Architekturen Altorfers vor sich gegangen ist. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0786 (1952-01-28 - Freiburg)Traumszenen, in denen die Farben grün-weiss-gelb eine Rolle spielten. Später eine Perlenkette oder eigentlich mehrere. Mein Vater und mein Grossvater kamen herein und nahmen aus einer Schublade neben dem Bett jeder eine Perlenkette an sich. Ich sagte, ist es denn schon nötig zu fliehen? (Krieg). Mein Vater antwortete: "Die Leute fliehen allenthalben." Doch schien er nicht viel von der Flucht zu erwarten. Eine dritte, kleinere Perlenkette schloss er mir um den Arm. Ich blieb in der Wärme meines Bettes liegen und betastete selig die Perlen. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0787 (1952-01-30 - Freiburg)Erste Szene spielt in einer Zeit, in der ich mit meinem Bruder zusammen wohne. Wir liegen schon in unseren Betten, die an zwei verschiedenen Wänden im rechten Winkel zueinander stehen. Er wünscht, dass die Vorhänge geschlossen werden, doch sagt dies -- halb in seinem Bette aufgerichtet -- in einer Weise, die mich zum Widerspruch reizt. Gleichzeitig habe ich auf meinem Bett ein Schloss liegen, mit dem man, nach der Weise eines Fahrradschlosses durch verschiedene Einstellungen des Schlüssels das Gewicht der Decke regulieren kann, die dann drückend schwer oder federleicht wird. Ich geniesse diese elegante Einrichtung. Schliesslich schliesse ich die leichten grünen Fenstervorhänge, die in kleinen Rollen auf einer Schiene gleiten, und lege mich wieder. Szenenwechsel. Aus dem Raum, in dem ich liege, ist eine grosse Turnhalle geworden. Chinesen (oder Japaner) stürmen hinein mit vielen grossen Bällen in den Armen und über dem Kopf getragen. Ich fürchte, sie wollen hier ein Spiel beginnen und bin ärgerlich über die Störung, doch bemerke ich bald, dass sie die Bälle nur ablegen und überhaupt eine sehr leises und diszipliniertes Auftreten haben. Auch japanische Mädchen kommen herein in weiten wehenden Mänteln. Eine der Figuren fällt mir besonders auf: Ihr Mantel, glockenförmig um sie fallend, ist von schwarz-weiss geschecktem Leopardenfell. Ich bin inzwischen aufgestanden und beginne mich anzukleiden. Die Japanerinnen bewundern den Europäer mit den flüsternden Worten: "Oh, wie sauber ist der." Ich bin zunächst über diesen Vergleich erstaunt, merke dann aber, dass die Asiaten in ihren schwarzen Haaren und ihrer gelblichen und braunen Haut alle etwas erdhaftes haben. Auch die Frauen sind in ihren weiten schwingenden Mänteln wie schöne Tiere, doch kann ich den Eindruck verstehen, den das Europäische auf sie macht, das aus einer anderen Sphäre kommt. Im Grunde ist es der Eindruck der Zivilisation, der sie beglückt. Eines der Mädchen mit aufgesteckten Haaren und in einem weissen chinesischen Gewand kommt zu mir heran und bringt mir die Bruchstücke meines Schlosses, mit dem ich das Gewicht der Decke regulieren konnte. Ich bin etwas erstaunt, wie sie mir die Teile in die Hand legt, nehme sie aber wie selbstverständlich entgegen. Sie trägt mir nun eine Bestellung in Deutschland auf, für die sie eine umständliche Reisebeschreibung mit Angaben der Eisenbahnlinie und --stationen unternimmt. Die Verständigung fällt uns schwer in den verschiedenen Sprachen. In einer etwas gewandelten Szene, die aber noch in derselben Räumlichkeit und bei entfernter Anwesenheit der Japaner spielt, habe ich eines der Mädchen, das einen Pagenschnitt trägt, auf dem Schoss und küsse ihr den Hals.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0789 (1952-02-01 - Freiburg)Heiss spielt Klavier, und zwar moderne Jazzmusik mit grosser Eleganz und trifft zugleich mit wenigen Worten die Theorie der Sache, ohne sich durch irgendwelche Vormeinungen stören zu lassen. Er hat oben auf dem Flügel eine zweite kleine Tastatur stehen (die im Grunde den Klötzchen gleicht, die man beim Anschlagspiel der Saiten sich heben und sich senken sieht, wenn ein Flügel geöffnet ist). Diese Tastatur handhabt er mit solcher Leichtigkeit, wie man sie sonst bei dem Spiel dieser Klötzchen sieht. Später schaltet einer seiner Adepten die Tastatur mit einer Orgel parallel und spielt sie selbst. Da ein Priester gegenwärtig ist und wir uns in einem kirchlichen Raum befinden, zum anderen ihm auch die Eleganz seines Meisters fehlt, scheinen mir die Grenzen überschritten. Andere Szene: Besuch von Plessner, der sehr liebenswürdig wirkt. Gang mit ihm in ein Seminar von Heiss. Auch seine Frau, ernst und bürgerlich (er hat in Wirklichkeit keine) ist mitgekommen. Nächste Szene: Gang mit Heiss durch einen Schwimmbad-artigen Raum (so wenigstens die Atmosphäre der Umgebung). Gespräch wohl über meine Arbeit. Er rät mir, mal allein mit seiner Frau zu sprechen, die eine starke Zuwendung -- auch körperlicher Art -- habe. Ich solle mich darüber nicht wundern, er habe nichts dagegen, nur wolle er in solchem Falle nicht die Speisen, die für mich gekocht seien, zu Ende essen und die Kleider zu Ende tragen. Mich beeindruckte die Grosszügigkeit solcher Regelung, ähnlich wie bei den Äusserungen über den Jazz (Es kann sein, dass die Seminarszene nicht zwischen diesen beiden Szenen, sondern an einer anderen Stelle im Traum gestanden hat). Nächste Szene: Hf., der wie ich Modell steht. Die Räumlichkeit ist noch ähnlich wie in der Szene mit Heiss. Auch war Hf. wohl schon bei Heissens letzten Worten zugegen. Hf. hat bereits das Podium bestiegen, singt aber, ehe er sich entkleidet, den Leuten noch etwas vor. Ich stehe hinter einer Glastür, durch die ich ihm zuzwinkere, und bereite mich ebenfalls für das Modellstehen vor. (322 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0790 (1952-02-02 - Freiburg)Ich sehe in einem modernen Film, der aufnahmetechnisch so gut ist, dass ich hell begeistert bin und zuweilen meine Begleiter neben mir aufmerksam darauf mache. So wird zum Beispiel ein Bergpanorama nicht so gezeigt, dass die einzelnen Berge und Bergzüge im Wandern der Kamera nebeneinander erscheinen, sondern die Kamera wird in einem grossen Bogen so geschwenkt, dass darin zugleich die Tiefe der Landschaft mit erscheint. Es ist, als ob diese kreisförmige Führung der Kamera mehr erschliesst wie eine einfach lineare. Die Bewegung der Optik verliert ihre Zufälligkeit und bekommt durch die vollendete Form der Kreislinie Ähnlichkeit mit einer geführten Tanzfigur, die zugleich in der Bewegung das Sichtbare erschliesst, indem sie Weite und Tiefe des Raumes verstehbar einander zuordnet. Der Film ist von einem ungarischen Regisseur. Andere Traumszenen: Abfahrt mit einer Strassenbahn. Die Haltestelle ist so angelegt, dass die Bahn zunächst bis zu ihr eine Weile steigen muss, dann aber kommt unmittelbar nach der Haltestelle ein Abhang, der so steil ist, dass das Gefälle schwebend überbrückt werden muss. Wir sehen gerade aus der entgegengesetzten Richtung einen so zur Schwebenbahn gewordenen Wagen entgegenkommen, der dann am Kopfe des Abhanges, bei der Haltestelle, elegant wieder in die Schienen einsetzt. Als Seil beim Schweben dient die Oberleitung, als Aufhängevorrichtung der Strombügel. Meine Begleiterin hat zunächst Angst, in eine solche schwebende Strassenbahn einzusteigen, während mir der Gedanke Genuss bereitet. Sie möchte indessen lieber den Abhang zu Fuss hinunter gehen und unten einsteigen. Dann kommt aber schon die Strassenbahn und wir steigen ein. Schon unten auf der tiefer gelegenen aber noch geneigten Ebene beginnt der Strom auszuschalten, doch nutzt der Fahrer das Gefälle aus, zieht nur die Bremsen soweit an, dass er mit ihnen den Wagen notfalls zum Stehen bringen kann, den er nun nicht mehr mit den Motor bremsen kann. Ich rechne mir aus, dass er so noch ein ganzes Stück fahren kann, denn es ist die Strecke am Faulen See (Schwerin), wo die Strassenbahn auf einem extra Grünstreifen neben der Strasse fahren kann, also nicht mit dem Verkehr in Konflikt gerät, und das Gefälle andauert. Mir imponiert diese Art, die Bewegung auszunutzen, und ich rechne mir aus, dass dann das Stück über den ansteigenden Paulshöherweg und durch den Rest der Strasse, in der wir wohnen, bis nach Hause (Elternhaus) nur noch kurz ist. Hier wechselt jedoch die Orientierung der Szene: Die Bahn fährt, immer noch dem Gefälle folgend, auf einer Asphaltstrasse und gerät nun mit dem Verkehr in Konflikt, da ein sehr kleines Auto (Hannomag), ein Strassenfloh, wie man zu sagen pflegt, seinen Motor nicht mehr abstellen kann und vor uns auf den Schienen fährt, doch langsamer als wir, die wir den Schwung der Schwerkraft haben. Im letzten Moment gelingt es ihm auszuweichen, doch gerät es dabei unter ein normales Auto, wohl einen Opel, der jedoch so hoch ist, dass es unversehrt unter der Karosserie stehen bleibt. Der Fahrer des Wagens hat sofort gestoppt und steigt wütend aus, auch der Fahrer des kleinen Wagens ist ausgestiegen -- die Szene ist hier allmählich wieder zum Film geworden -- zieht seinen kleinen Wagen unter dem grosse raus, nimmt ihn wie ein Spielzeugauto in die Hand, um ihn aufzuziehen und dann in der Richtung der Strasse abzuburren. Hier ist zugleich das Ende des Films, der in einer Freilichtaufführung gezeigt wird. Aus der Leinwand wird die Kulisse: Man sieht in die mit kleinen Lichtern besetzte abendliche Strasse hinein, die sich nach hinten verjüngt -- doch durch ein Verschieben der rechten Strassenseite, die Kulisse ist, stellt sich das Bild einer Freiburger Passage her, die den Raum des Freilichtkinos bildet. Die Kulissenwand wird dann noch einmal zurück geschoben, so dass das letzte Bild des Films wiederkehrt, und so gleichsam ein Changieren der Raumauffassung zwischen Spiel und Wirklichkeit erzeugt wird, das mir sehr imponiert. Andere Traumszenen: Vorne links ist eine Kasse, offenbar die Kinokasse, doch hier dient sie dem Verkauf von Bildern, Kunstreproduktionen. Ich betrachte einen solchen Stapel. Die Verkäuferin gesellt sich hinzu und will mir etwas verkaufen. Ich habe jedoch kein Geld bei mir und vertröste sie auf später. Die kleinen, Postkarten-grossen, Reproduktionen kosten 30 Pfennig, -- die grossen Bilder fünf Mark. Auf einem dieser Bilder sieht man eine Frau mit enthüllten Brüsten. Andere Traumszene: Ich gehe direkt am Ufer der See auf einer Promenade: Gelber Sand und Steinweg. Der Sturm schlägt die Wogen in mächtiger Brandung an die Quaimauer, über der sie mannshoch aufschäumen. Ich gehe so dicht an den Wogen an der sehr niedrigen Quaimauer, dass eine auch nur etwas grössere Woge mich überfluten würde. Dann sehe ich draussen in den Wellen ein Schiff -- und bin auf diesem Schiff. Dort ist ein Mädchen, das ich oft in der Mensa sehe und das mir wegen seiner derben und zugleich doch differenzierten und sehr urtümlichen Sinnlichkeit gefällt und mit dem ich einmal einige Worte wechselte. Ich setzte mich zu ihr und betaste ihre Brust, deren Sein zum Saugen mir besonders klar deutlich wird. Mich beglückt und erregt diese Einheit des Sinnvollen mit dem Leidenschaftlichen. Erwachen.

Dann bin auch ich wieder dort -- und nun auch Gisela, die sich in dieser Jungensschule wohler fühlt als im Lyceum. Sie läuft während des Sports nackt auf dem Schulhof herum. Andere Traumszene: Jemand hält eine Abiturrede über den Humanismus bei Goethe. Ich sage: "Merkwürdig, über dasselbe Thema habe ich meine Abiturrede gehalten." Szenenwechsel: Herr F. kommt herein, mit Bart, etwas existentialistisch. Er unterhält sich mit Emmi, die das Essen kocht, auf Plattdeutsch. Er ist am Dickdarm operiert worden. Ich kann nicht alles verstehen, was er sagt. Emmi flüstert mir zu, es wäre eine grosse Schmiererei gewesen. (121 words)

Heidegger liess sich die Studienbücher aller Teilnehmer geben, um etwas darin einzutragen.

Während er noch dabei ist meinen Begleiter, der sich geschickt entzieht, ins Kreuzverhör zu nehmen, gehe ich langsam und unauffällig fort, durch den Schnee um eine grosse Kirche und überlege, ob ich nun in wenigen Sätzen fliehen soll, wofür wenig Chancen bestehen oder den Kontrolleur ins Vertrauen ziehen und überreden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0796 (1952-02-08 - Freiburg)Besuch bei einer Grossherzogin, einer sehr eigenen älteren Dame, mit der ich frühstücke. Dann Fahrt mit ihrem Hofstaat in der Strassenbahn. Es geht aus ihrem Wohnsitz durch eine schöne Landschaft in die Stadt hinein. Auf der Rückfahrt hat die Bahn mehrfach Betriebsstörungen (der Strom bleibt weg). Umsteigen in eine andere Strassenbahn. Die Szene ist jetzt so, dass diese Linie ins Elternhaus führt -- nur angedeutet: Schwerin. Ich stehe vorne in der Strassenbahn mit vielen jungen Mädchen, die sich eng an mich schmiegen und Schutz und Liebe suchen. Einmal sehe ich links auf einem roten Ziegeldach einen Radfahrer wie einen Seiltänzer oder Nachtwandler fahren. Später verlässt er das Dach, um schwebend über die Strassen hinweg ein anderes Haus zu erreichen. Hier bricht das Bild ab. Andere Szene: Emmi schneidet mir die Haare. Meine Schwester Adelheid tritt herzu, als die Haare gerade seitlich gekämmt sind, und will die eine Seite kurz, die andere Seite lang geschnitten haben, das sehe netter aus. Ich nehme jedoch den Rat nicht an, sondern lasse die Haare wie zuvor zurückkämmen und nur die unterste längere Schicht mit einem grossen Schnitt kürzen. Emmi schneidet mir dabei fast ins Ohrläppchen hinein. Erwachen in glücklicher und ausgeruhter Lage. (198 words)

Ich sprach sie aus dem Fenster einer unteren Etage, während sie oben auf einem gläsernen Balkon lag, der von unten durchsichtig war. Sie nannte mich mit dem Nachnamen, offenbar um ihrer Stellung als Schwester wegen, doch war ich geneigt, sie wie immer mit ihrem Vornamen Maria anzureden. (75 words)

Ich will auf die Insel Kaninchenwerder (im Schweriner See). Die Frage ist, zu welcher Dampferhaltestelle ich gehen soll (Zippendorf oder Stadtmitte). Ich gehe in Richtung Zippendorf. Es geht ums Milch holen. Elisabeth Baumgarten, die mir den Auftrag gegeben hat, spielt hinein. Auf der Insel ist ein alter Bauernhof -- rückwärtig, wenn man um die Insel herumgeht. Dort fliesst ein Rinnsal in den See. Schon als Kind, wie ich Elisabeth Baumgarten erzähle, haben wir dort Milch geholt -- als sie zweifelt, dass ich die Stelle finden würde. Das ganze Unternehmen hat etwas Geheimnisvolles. Auf dem Weg nach Zippendorf verirre ich mich jedoch am Eingang des Waldes, komme von dem Uferweg des grossen Sees nach rechts ab und sehe plötzlich den Faulen See -- von seinem Ende aus überschaubar, über ihm lauter Krähen. Andere Szene spielt um Kottmeier und Israel, wobei Israel die Rolle eines Art Psychotherapeuten für uns für uns spielt oder spielen will. (167 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0802 (1952-02-18 - Freiburg)Gisela, die zugleich Züge von Emmi und meiner Schwester trägt, hat ein Negerbaby, das sie mit aller Selbstverständlichkeit füttert und versorgt. Ich glaube ihr indessen nicht, dass es von ihr sei, da ich sie nicht schwanger gesehen habe. Aus einer Mitteilung im Radio, in der der Name des Kindes und seiner Schwester, ein englisch klingender Name, genannt wird, entnehme ich, dass es eine andere Mutter hat. Andere Szene: Besuch von zwei Engländerinnen. Sie sehen auf der Fensterbank Engelins Kopfplastik (Gipsabguss) stehen, die er von mir gemacht hat. Aus der Backen- und Nasengegend ist ein Stück abgebröckelt, das sie wieder ankleben wollen, wobei es noch mehr zu zerbrechen droht. Ich bitte sie, es zu lassen. In der Eile fallen mir nur französische Worte ein: "non, s'il vous plaît". Nächste Szene: Ich erzähle Gisela von einem Film, den ich dabei gleichzeitig sehe, in dem das Leben eines modernen Menschen dadurch karikiert ist, dass er von Behörde zu Behörde laufen muss -- doch in abstrakter Darstellung: Die Behörde, mit Schildern versehen, wie Torbögen in einem Krokettspielfeld. Die Langsamkeit des ganzen Vorgangs wird mit umgekehrten Vorzeichen dargestellt, wie ein Film im Zeitraffer, in dem er im Blitztempo von einer Behörde zur anderen gelangt, in jeder Schlange vorgelassen wird, und im Nu alles erledigt hat. Das Ganze erzähle ich als eine Szene aus dem Revuefilm "Pariser Nächte". Später sehen wir noch andere Filmtricks: Reklamen, bei denen Zuschauerraum und die Bühne, auf der die Leinwand hängt, durch raffinierte Beleuchtungseffekte mitspielen, illusionäres Licht, das durch Spiegelungen den Raum wie eine Fata Morgana auf der Leinwand mit erscheinen lässt. Auch orangefarbene Vorhänge. (264 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0804 (1952-02-20 - Freiburg)Es ist Krieg. Ich bin mit Ika an dem Grenzfluss zwischen Ostpreussen und Russland, wo sie in einem Haus mit ihren Eltern und Geschwistern wohnt. Wir stehen beide am Ufer des Flusses und betrachten die Kriegsschiffe auf ihm, zwei leichte deutsche Kreuzer in hellgrauer Farbe und feindliche Schiffe. Ika meint, sie würden wohl demnächst schiessen, aber wir brauchten nichts zu fürchten, sie schössen ja nur aufeinander. Dann entsteht plötzlich eine Bewegung. Einer der Kreuzer beginnt nach links fortzufahren. Kleine schwarze Schnellboote flitzen über den Strom. Am anderen Ufer sieht man fremde, englische Soldaten auftauchen. Unheimlich ist die Lautlosigkeit des ganzen Vorgangs, die um so stärker seinen zügigen Zusammenhang durchschauen lässt. Wir starren gespannt auf die Soldaten am anderen Ufer. Diese legen plötzlich auf uns an, da sie uns für ihnen gefährliche Beobachter halten müssen. Wir kehren ihnen den Rücken, was uns für sie gefahrlos macht, und begeben uns ins Haus, wo wir die nichtsahnenden Eltern auf die Ereignisse vorbereiten. Andere Szene: Ich beginne mit einem anderen Mädchen, das irgendwie von weiter rechts kommen muss, die Flucht, wobei wir zunächst durch den Flur des Hauses von Ikas Eltern und Familie hindurchgehen, leise die Türen öffnen und irgendwie den Hauch des Lebens und des Schlafes hinter nur angelehnten Seitentüren spüren. Andere Szene: Flucht -- jetzt wieder ohne das Mädchen -- zunächst auf Schiffen auf der Ostsee (von diesem Szenenteil habe ich nur eine sehr vage Erinnerung), dann in einem angehaltenen Auto auf der Uferstrasse, einer nicht sehr breiten Asphaltstrasse, die direkt am Rande der Ostsee entlang führt. Der Wagen, in dem ich mitfahre, gleicht einem der kleinen Volkswagen-Omnibuse, in denen man hoch sitzt und durch eine grosse Glasscheibe die ganze Landschaft überschaut. Dann Einzug in Lübeck. Sehr beglückend. Ich bewundere die alte Architektur, das Holstentor und alte Ruinen, die zum Teil romanische Züge haben, den Charakter einer Einfahrt (das Bild bestimmter Fassaden nach der ersten Zerstörung der Stadt Rostock scheint herein zu spielen). Andere Szene: in einem Lazarett, von dem aus die Entlassung vorzugehen scheint. Dort werden, glaube ich, die Haare geschnitten. Schleswig-Holstein scheint irgendwie hinein zu spielen, auf der anderen Seite in der Räumlichkeit der Schweriner Schlosshof. (356 words)

Ich hatte ein etwas schlechtes Gewissen, genoss aber. Nach der Ankunft nahm mich Adenauer mit in sein Haus zu einer Debatte. Die SPD-Leute redeten sehr lebhaft, während er unbeweglich neben mir sass und zuhörte. Dieses Schweigen machte ihn mir sehr sympathisch. Schliesslich fiel der Hauptredner der SPD plötzlich hin . Ich war nun sehr erstaunt, wie behutsam und gütig sich Adenauer um ihn bemühte und ihn mit mir ins Badezimmer trug. Später erzählte ich den ganzen Vorfall als Anhalter-Erlebnis meinem Vater.

Ich kneife indessen ein wenig die Augen, weil ich nicht sicher bin, ob er nicht doch im letzten Moment zuhacken wird. Bei dem ganzen Vorgang sitze ich in einem Fenster, das in einen grossen kubischen Raum hineinschaut, der einem Tierpsychologischen Institut angehört. Ein Mann mit einer Kamera scheint den Vorgang zu filmen. In einer anderen Szene ist auch der Direktor dieses Psychologischen Instituts gegenwärtig, der seine Assistenten anweist. Ich höre ihn sagen: Ich wünsche, dass auf jeden Anruf die Kamera sofort gegenwärtig ist, falls sie mit ihr umherfahren. Ein Assistent antwortet: "Zur Zeit ist das Telephon kaputt." Vor diesem allem und noch vor der Vogelszene folgende Traumszene: Ich bin Assistent in einem psychologischen Seminar, das sich "Seminar für Medizinische Psychologie" nennt. Während ich ein Telephongespräch führe, ist mir der Name meines Chefs entfallen, worüber man am anderen Ende der Leitung im "Psychologischen Seminar II", das ich angerufen habe, mich auslacht.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0808 (1952-02-23 - Freiburg)Einfahrt mit der Eisenbahn in eine zerstörte Stadt. Über Brücken und Flüsse hinweg (wie in Hamburg). Endlich sehe ich zwischen lauter Trümmern und Ruinen wieder ein Haus im Aufbau -- aber viel zu dicht an der Bahn -- ach so, das baut man aus den alten Trümmern wieder zusammen (weisser Stein). Ich gehe hinein und wundere mich, dass man die alten Putten wieder verwandt hat -- zum Teil noch abgestützt durch Holzstreben. An einer Stelle hat man die Putten einfach provisorisch über Kopf eingesetzt. Um aus dem Haus herauszukommen, muss ich gerade an dieser Stelle kriechen. Der Gang wird immer enger. Schliesslich sitze ich, den Kopf schon draussen, aber zwischen lauter Stacheldraht fest, der mich bei jeder Bewegung am Hals und am Kopf verletzen muss. Dann wohnt aber Gisela in dem Haus. Sie weiss ein Kellerfenster, wo man die Gitterstäbe einfach abdecken und dann heraussteigen kann. (146 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0809 (1952-02-25 - Freiburg)Traumszene: Ich habe Geburtstag. Unten flutet das Faschingsvolk über einen Balkon in das Haus hinein und will eine Führung haben. Oben sind in meinem Käfigstübchen Tante Lu und andere zu Besuch, die mir einen reizenden Geburtstagstisch aufgebaut haben. Irgend etwas, ein Geschenk, das in seinen Feldern quadratisch aufgeteilt ist, wird später mit Butter bekleckst und dadurch unleserlich. Andere Traumszene: Ein Mann mit Pferdewagen. Das Pferd wird wild, will durchgehen. Er steht hinten und zwiebelt es sehr brutal am Schwanz, bis es wieder ruhig ist. Dann setzt er sich auf den Bock und fährt ab, sich sehr gemütlich an sein Tier anlehnend. Beide sind jetzt ein Herz und eine Seele. Das Tier muss übrigens, was mir während des Traumes nicht aufgefallen ist, nicht vor, sondern hinter dem Wagen gegangen sein, denn sonst hätte er zuerst nicht frei hinter seinem Schwanz stehen können, nachher sich nicht so gemütlich an seine Schnauze anlehnen, was er direkt von vorne, jedoch auf seinem Kutschbock sitzend, tat. Ich kann das ganze Bild nicht mehr richtig rekonstruieren. Anscheinend war in der Bewegung des ganzen Fahrzeugs auch etwas wie die Selbstbewegung eines Autos, so dass das Pferd irgendwie gleichzeitig Mitfahrer war. Ich kann jedoch die Anschauung des ganzen Bildes nicht mehr bekommen, nur die Details. Andere Szene: Tanzende Paare. Mädchen mit weissen Röcken in weit geöffneter Stellung, Tänzer die ihr Glied wie einen Pfahl in sie hinein gerammt haben. Die Bewegung der Paare hatte etwas Schwebendes wie Segelboote, die Figuren wie Aufnahmen aus grossen Balletts, bei denen die Tänzerin in der Luft einen grossen Spagat macht. Das Ganze von ägyptischer Ruhe und Hingabe. (265 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0810 (1952-02-27 - Freiburg)Traumszenen: Spaziergang mit Ika durch Freiburg. Zweitens: Eine grosse Glocke, die im Durchgang eines Rathauses aufgehängt ist und die Passanten an den Kopf zu schlagen droht, weil sie sehr niedrig hängt. Sie ist der Form nach nicht rund, sondern etwas flach (wie eine Kuh-Schelle). Ich meine mich dunkel an eine Traumszene mit Giselas Vater zu erinnern, doch wollen mir Einzelheiten nicht einfallen. Es könnte ein Zusammenhang mit der Glockenszene durch die Assoziation zu einem Filmbild bestehen, in dem ich ihn die Glocke des Köngisberger Doms läuten sah, die man in Burg aufgehängt hat. -- Drittens: Ein Bild in einer Zeitung, die meinem Bruder gehört, auf dem man mehrere blonde Mädchen sieht, die wohl Kinder betreuen; eines dieser Mädchen sieht dem Haarschnitt und der Haltung nach ganz aus wie Marion. Ich komme zu dem Schluss, dass sie es sei. - Viertens: Dann Traum vom Erzbischof. Er will eine Vorlesung über den Spuk halten. Ich begleite ihn aus einer Kapelle, in der er eine Messe gehalten hat, einer Art Domkapelle, in seinem Kutschwagen. Er trägt ein weites Gewand (das genau dem gleicht, das ich in einem der vergangenen Faschingsfeste in der Kunstakademie und Musikhochschule getragen habe, nämlich Giselas Gardine, die ich mir weit um die Schultern warf, und die in der Tat an ein priesterliches Gewand erinnerte, zugleich durch ihren geblümten Stoff an etwas Chinesisches erinnerte.) Wir sprechen während der Fahrt über die Messe, die etwas zu lange gedauert hat, weil einer der Priester sich einmal in der Liturgie versprochen und auch zu langsam gelesen hat. Wir steigen dann aus, und während wir eine Treppe in einem grossen Gebäude hochsteigen, gibt er mir den Auftrag, etwas an einen Professor auszurichten, das ich nur schwer behalten kann, weil ich im Grunde auf diesem Gebiet dilettantisch bin. Auch weiss ich nicht, wie ich in diesem Brief an den Professor von dem Erzbischof reden soll, mit dem Titel Hochwürden und in der dritten Person oder anders. Wir verabschieden uns dann. Es gehen viele Treppen parallel in diesem Treppenhaus angeordnet wie die Orgelpfeifen, doch so, dass man oft nicht sehen kann, ob sie nach oben oder unten führen. So sehe ich den Erzbischof auf einer fortgehen, von der ich nicht weiss, ob sie ihn in die Tiefe oder nach oben führt. Ich selbst muss oft über Geländer steigen, um die richtige Treppe jeweils zu finden. (389 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0811 (1952-03-02 - Rötteln)[Rötteln am Hochrhein] Traumbilder: Ich bin Oberleutnant geworden und Batteriechef. Glücklicherweise ist der ehemalige Batteriechef noch anwesend, da ich noch nicht viel von der Sache verstehe. Einmal musste ich in Erledigung irgend eines Auftrages von meiner Truppe fort. Als ich zurückkomme, ist dort gerade ein grosse Musterung durch den General. Ich suche vergeblich meinen Haufen, den ich noch wenig kenne. Höre, wie der General sagt: "Ich zähle bis drei, dann muss jeder an seinem Platz stehen." Es gelingt mir im letzten Moment den richtigen Platz zu finden. Meine Leute sind nicht da, doch steht ein Tisch von ihnen da, wie ein Weihnachtstisch mit Kuchenresten. Die Leute offenbar im Einsatz. Ich bitte den General um Urlaub, um zu ihnen zu reiten. Andere Szene: Ein Hund "Flecki", der aber aussieht wie "Pfiffi", beisst einen kleinen schwarzen so lange, bis er tot ist. Ich höre den schwarzen Hund rufen: "Hör doch auf, du beisst mich ja tot". Aber Flock scheint taub zu sein. Ich stosse ihn mit dem Fuss, doch nichts hilft. Schliesslich liegt der schwarze Hund sterbend da. Flock zieht seine blutige Schnauze zurück, starr und schaut entsetzt ,was er angerichtet hat, aber doch voller Gier. Andere Szene: Radfahren mit Monsieur Mignot: Wir suchen eine Arbeit auf einem Gut am anderen Ufer des Schweriner Sees. Doch noch ehe wir die Stadt verlassen haben, wird es ihm zuviel, weil er vormittags schon per Anhalter in Frankfurt war. Die letzten Kurven durch die engen Gassen sind schwierig zu fahren, da überall die Menschen Glasgefässe auf den Strassen aufgestellt haben, die wie auf einem Rembrandt'schen Bild im Schatten kaum zu sehen, nur zu ahnen sind. Dritte Szene: Ein Faschingsfest, bei dem Gisela fast nackend auf einem Tisch liegt. Ich bin in meinen Gefühlen hin und her gerissen zwischen wildem Zupacken und stolzem Rückzug, weil mich ihre Worte kränken. In einer anderen Traumszene küsse ich sie, doch bin ich gehemmt, weil ein Mann dabei ist, der mich vorher mit einem anderen Mädchen sah, das ich auch liebe. (328 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0813 (1952-03-05 - Rötteln)[Schloss Rötteln am Rhein] Architekturtraum. Schwerin. Haltestelle der Strassenbahn in der Königstrasse bei der Schelfkirche, an der ausserdem noch der Name eines Stifts und der Name Roggow ausgerufen wird. Man sieht auf dem schön geformten Schelfplatz rechts das Stift, links das Schloss in gotischer Architektur mit einer grossen Kirche. Es wird mir gesagt, dass jetzt irgend etwas anderes in dem Schloss Roggow untergebracht sei. Ich sehe Licht in dem grossen Kirchenschiff, das eigentlich den Hauptteil des Schlosses einnimmt, und versuche, hereinzusehen, um zu entdecken, ob der Raum noch als Kirche dient und ich also hineingehen kann. Andere Szene: Liesel Hartmann und Ika, die mich beide lieben und darum beide traurig sind. Sie wohnen beide in einer grossen Scheune, an deren Rande Kammern ausgespart sind. Vor allem Ika wartet sehr. Ich will durch eine lukenartige Tür in die Scheune einsteigen. Doch drinnen steht B. mit einigen Komplizen und wirft mit grossen Steinbrocken nach mir. Ich drehe mich nicht um, da er mich dann sofort im Rücken getroffen hätte, sondern strecke nur die geöffnete Hand aus, an deren Innenfläche die Steine fast schmerzlos, von hypnotischer Kraft gebremst abprallen. Ich bin mir dieser Kraft bewusst und suche, mich auf sie zu konzentrieren. Schliesslich lasse ich mich in den Raum herabgleiten. Dies ist der gefährlichste Augenblick, denn in diesem Moment bin ich nicht voll in der Lage, die Steine abzuwehren. Auch Hf. ist im Raum, doch ohne mir helfen zu können. Ich wäre jetzt in der Lage, B. und seine Helfer zu überführen, doch lasse ich sie. Andere Szene spielt um das Abnehmen von Gardinen im Zuge des Ausräumens irgend einer Kammer in der selben Räumlichkeit. Ich kann wohl die Gardinen abnehmen und auch die Ringe, nicht aber die Schnüre, an denen sie hängen, weil sie mit diesen zugleich gezogen werden. Es ist ein kompliziertes Netz von Schnüren, das sich in einem Strang auch schräg unter der Decke hinzieht und an ein Leitungsnetz erinnert. Hf., der anscheinend selbst mit seinen Gardinen an der Sache beteiligt ist, berät mich. (330 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0823 (1952-03-14 - Bonn)Traum von Jörg Brena. Er begegnete mir auf der Strasse und erzählte mir, sehr leise sprechend, einen Traum, während wir in ein Geschäft reingingen, wo er etwas kaufte. Zuweilen musste ich ihm während dessen auf sein Geheiss seinen Kragen zurecht ziehen und an seinem Anzug etwas ordnen. Ich deutete ihm dann den Traum, in dem seine Mutter und, ich glaube, seine Freundin eine grosse Rolle spielten. Leider habe ich im Einzelnen den sehr fein differenzierten und gut deutbaren Traum vergessen. Ich weiss noch, dass es mir leicht fiel, ihn verstehbar zu machen, dass auch Tiere -- es kann sein, ein geflügeltes Pferd, darin eine Rolle spielten. Dann ging ich zu Mudding Schultz, in der Werderstrasse (Emmis Mutter), die krank war, und brachte ihr etwas zu essen. Ich hatte, als besonderen Leckerbissen, einen Teil meiner Traumsammlung, den ich früher einmal zerrissen hatte, auf süsses Papier abgeschrieben. Doch konnte ich mich schliesslich nicht davon trennen, da ich es wohl auch schade fand, dass Schriftwerk zu essen, und ausserdem fürchtete, Mudding, die eine starke Ateriosklerose hatte und bereits in einer fremden Phantasiewelt lebte, könne es zu falschen Zwecken gebrauchen. Ich fand in ihrer Stube schon verschiedene Mahlzeiten bereitet, zum Teil sehr hübsch garniert, auch mit Papierservietten, und hörte auch Geräusche -- offenbar von hilfreichen Nachbarn -- aus dem Nebenzimmer. Vor allem sah ich viele Pfannkuchen in einem Teller auf dem Tisch stehen. Ich sagte zu Mudding: "Du hast Pfannkuchen". Sie antwortete nichts verstehend und schelmisch lachend: "Pfannkuchen? Du Schlingel!" (246 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0824 (1952-03-16 - München)Träume vom Autofahren und Reiten. Erste Szene: Verlegung des amerikanischen Hauptquartiers von Heidelberg nach Wien. Unendliche Kolonnen breiter amerikanischer Wagen auf den Strassen, auch Panzer. Der deutsche Verkehr der Volkswagen und kleinen Modelle spielte sich auf kleinen und steilen Neben- und Umleitungsstrassen ab, auf denen oft ein Begegnen kaum möglich war und nur bei schwierigem Umfahren von Baumstämmen und Steinen. Ich war erstaunt, wie dies bei der Geschwindigkeit und dem Gefälle doch immer glückte, doch froh, dass ich nicht selber zu lenken brauchte. -- Andere Szene spielt um eine Art Verfolgung, wohl durch Russen, die ich einerseits sah, andererseits erzählt hörte und drittens selber erlebte. Schwierige Klettereien mit Treppen und Leitern. Plötzliches Springen und Entweichen in seitliche Haustüren. Entzug im letzten Augenblick durch immer neue Einfälle, Umdrehen eines Hebels, das wohl die Tür zu einem Kamin öffnete, und ähnliches. -- Drittens: Reitszene: Zunächst nur mit einem Freund zusammen, der Züge von Hf. trägt. Hier spielen die Russen noch hinein. Er hat eine Art Trabrennbahn gebaut durch ein Flussbett und über ein Sandsteingeröll. Die Russen gaben dazu die Erlaubnis. Dann reite ich selber. Galoppieren auf Pferden, die wie im Fluge den Kopf auf den Rücken zurücklegen, so dass er einem fast im Schoss liegt und die Nüstern des Tieres das Glied des Reiters berühren. Mein Begleiter sagt, als ich die Haltung der Tiere mit dem Zügel korrigieren will: "Lass ihm doch die Freude". Ich lerne allmählich, eine feine und spielende Macht über das Tier zu gewinnen, mit den Knien die richtigen Hilfen zu geben, mich mit den Oberschenkeln richtig festzuklemmen. Einmal bin ich erstaunt über das feine Reagieren auf eine Zügelbewegung, wie man sie bei durchgehenden Pferden macht. Später ist dann eine Begleiterin bei uns, deren Gegenwart mich unendlich beglückt. Einmal, als ich sie an den Schultern fassen will, entsteht die Gebärde des Mantel Ausziehens, dadurch dass das Pferd unter ihr weiter geht und sie sozusagen aus dem Kleidungsstück fortträgt. Wir brechen in ein herrliches Gelächter aus, da uns die Szene an eine Ulkzeichnung aus einem Reiterbuch erinnert. Überhaupt besass diese ganze Begegnung eine grosse Heiterkeit, und nach dem Erwachen bleiben mir die strahlenden Augen des Mädchens im Sinne, ohne dass ich verstehen kann, welchem Menschen sie gehören. Die schmale Gestalt hatte Züge von meiner Schwester und ihrer Tochter Sigrid. Dann auf einmal leuchtete mir ein, dass es die Augen von Spechts Freundin Dagmar in Bonn waren, die aber eine ganz andere Körperlichkeit hat. (403 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0826 (1952-03-18 - München)Ich komme nach Hause und finde mein Zimmer voller indischer Düfte, die Gisela mit einem ihrer Räucherstäbchen erzeugt hat, und einen Brief von Gisela auf meinem Bett liegen. Es sind aber noch andere Betten im Raum -- es muss ein Zimmer in Wittmoldt sein --, eines neben den meinen ist mir verständlich, es gehört einem Stubengenossen, ein drittes macht mich zunächst stutzig, zumal es eigentlich ein Kinderbett ist -- dann erfahre ich, dass es für einen weiteren Wittmoldter Bekannten, den Gottfried N., gedacht ist. (Dieser ist zwar jung, aber sehr lang.) Andere Szene: Ich gehe in die Schule. Mein Bruder und ich sind lange krank gewesen, und ich will die Lage für uns erforschen. Zunächst begegnet mir Herr Plate, vor dem ich eine gewisse Verlegenheit habe und der sehr höflich zu mir ist. Dann ein Schüler (den Zügen nach wohl eigentlich ein Mitstudent), der von "Eigo" Walter redet und, dass dieser gesagt habe, "die Uslars sind intelligent", ich habe aber nicht genau verstanden, ob "sehr" intelligent "nicht" intelligent, und folge darum dem Schüler, um ihn nochmal zu fragen, und werde dabei in ein Spiel auf dem Schulhof verwickelt. Der Schüler ging in eine Art Lehmgrube, in die die oben am Rande Stehenden Lehmbrocken auf die unten Stehenden hineinwarfen. Die Aufgabe der unten Stehenden, zu denen ich nun auch gehöre, ist es, den Brocken geschickt auszuweichen. Doch das Ausweichen wird mir bald über. Ich fasse den Flug der Brocken ins Auge, strecke die Hände aus, an deren Handtellern die Brocken leicht abprallen. Diese ruhige und konzentrierte Art der Abwehr befriedigt mich mehr als das Gejagtwerden und dauernde Springen. Andere Szene: Eine Strassenbahn mit drei Anhängern. Ich will nach Littenweiler mit einem Begleiter. Die Strassenbahn fährt nur alle zwanzig Minuten, die Szene des Abfahrtsplatzes entspricht jedoch dem Marienplatz in Schwerin, von wo die Linie Drei ins Elternhaus abging. Ich rate meinem Begleiter einen Lauf, da ich einen Wagen sich der seitab von der Verkehrsinsel gelegenen Haltestelle nähern sehe, auf dem ein Schild "E-Wagen" (in Freiburg = Einsatzwagen) steht. Dann beginnt die Bahn zu rangieren und sich der Verkehrsinsel zu nähern. Ich entdecke jetzt die drei Anhänger. Sie fährt auf einem extra kleinem Bahnsteig auf der Verkehrsinsel ein und ich höre, wie ausgerufen wird: "Alle Amerikaner bitte hierher kommen " - es ist nämlich so, dass die Strassenbahn in einen Vorort fährt, in dem irgendein Hauptquartier der Amerikaner oder ähnliches liegt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0827 (1952-03-19 - Freiburg)Traum von Gisela. Sie will mich besuchen. Die Szenerie gleicht der des Elternhauses in Schwerin vor 1938: Oben mein (unser) Zimmer, in der mittleren Etage die Familienwohnräume, zur Haustüre muss man eine Treppe hinab gehen und aufschliessen -- doch den Freiburger Verhältnissen glich, dass für die oberste Etage eine extra Klingel war. An dieser nun klingelte Gisela, während ich unten beschäftigt war. Ich konnte nicht gleich hinablaufen -- als ich an der Haustüre ankam, war Gisela bereits zornig im Weggehen begriffen. Sie trug nur einen schwarzen Büstenhalter, eine offenstehende schwarze Samtjacke und ihren dunkelbraunen russischen Rock, so dass sich die Haut des Körpers scharf gegen die schwarzen Stoffe abhob. Ihre Lippen waren tief dunkelrot geschminkt, das Gesicht hatte etwas weniger gefasstes als sonst, Weicheres und Fleischlicheres. (126 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0828 (1952-03-19 - Freiburg)Ein Haus, in dem ich wohne. Ein grosser gigantischer Bau, in dem oben irgendwo unterm Dach mein Käfig ist. Zuweilen bröckeln Teile von dem bombengeschädigten Haus ab. Dabei wird einmal mein Käfig so erschüttert, dass er zu bluten beginnt und das Gestänge aus rohem Holz mit hellrotem Blut bespritzt ist. Wenn man das Haus von aussen besieht, sieht man, dass eigentlich nur die oberen Etagen bewohnt sind, die über der Ruinenhaftigkeit der unteren schweben, zuweilen wie Erker frei in der Luft. Ganz oben geht eine Eisenbahnlinie hindurch, die in den oberen Stock wie in einen Hügel einschneidet. Schon das Vorbeigehen auf der Strasse an diesem Haus ist gefährlich, wegen der herabstürzenden Brocken. In diesem Haus, das zugleich eine Art Jugendherberge ist, wohnt auch meine Schwester mit Bekannten, darunter einem Arzt, mit denen ich zu Mittag speisen soll. Meine Schwester schickt mich aber aus dem Speisezimmer noch einmal zurück, weil ich noch meine Hose mit dem geflickten Knien anhabe (in die ich mir in Frankfurt beim Fallen ein Loch gerissen hatte). Ich solle die heile braune anziehen. Auf dem Wege zu meinem Käfig suche ich einen Abort. Ich finde aber nur Misthaufen hinter Verschlägen. Dann steige ich eine Treppe hoch und komme in das Terrain, wo die Eisenbahn in das Haus einschneidet. Der Gleiskörper ist mit Gittern gesichert. Blink-Lampen warnen wie bei unbewachten Bahnübergängen. In der Mitte des Hauses, auf dessen anderer Seite mein Käfig ist (es hat zwei Treppenhäuser), sind grosse Säle zu durchqueren. (244 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0829 (1952-03-21 - Freiburg)Vielerlei Traumszenen, die ich wohl im Einzelnen, aber nicht der Reihe nach behalten konnte. Eine Szene: Franzosen, wohl Pioniere, auf Fahrrädern in einer Kolonne unterwegs. Die beiden letzten tragen ein sehr langes Brett (hinter einander fahrend) und fahren dabei sehr schnell um eine Ecke. Das überstehende Ende des Brettes verstellt in der Drehung einem alten Mann, der auf seinem Fahrrad aus einer Seitenstrasse kommt, den Weg und zwingt ihn in eine andere Richtung. Er ergreift in seiner Angst das Brett, wird auf die Brüstung am Ufer eines Flusses zugetrieben, kann sich erst im letzten Moment entschliessen, loszulassen, und wird durch die Geschwindigkeit von seinem Rad herunter und im Salto Mortale über die Brüstung in den Fluss geschleudert. Die Franzosen kümmern sich nicht darum und fahren im selben Tempo weiter. Ich rufe ihnen nach: "Halt, halt", um die Schuldigen zur Rede zu stellen -- niemand kann sie halten. Dann laufe ich zur Böschung des Stromes. Ich sehe den Mann bereits wieder aus dem Wasser auftauchen mit erhobenen Armen unter einer Brücke, zu der die Brüstung gehörte, und sich dem Ufer nähern. Als ich ein wenig weiter, wo ich inzwischen stehe, die Böschung zum Fluss hinab klettern will, recken sich mir zwei nackte Mädchenarme entgegen, ganz leicht mit Wasser beperlt. Ich ziehe dann das ganze Mädchen zu mir heraus, das eine wunderbare, weiche Körperlichkeit hat. Sie trägt einen weiss-grauen Badeanzug, der wie der Körper in einen leicht feuchten Schleier gehüllt ist, und hat ein wenig die Züge von Ulli Baum, doch nur angedeutet und bei anderer Körperlichkeit. Ich schmiege das Mädchen an mich, und wir sprechen über den Fall des alten Mannes, der sich inzwischen wie fast leblos am Ufer ausruht. Andere Szene: Ich gehe mit einem Mädchen auf der Strasse. Ein winziger Stier, sozusagen ein Stierkalb, verstellt uns den Weg. Doch hat er schon beachtliche kleine Hörner. Ich starre dem Tier in die Augen, um es zu bannen, das den Kopf so weit hebt, dass unsere Blicke sich gerade noch im flachsten Winkel treffen, während das Mädchen Schutz suchen hinter mich tritt. Andere Szene: Ich fahre in einem Auto -- altes Modell, wie bei Benders Wagen -- auf den Gutshof von Rothspalk, der in der Tat viel schöner und weniger pedantisch geordnet ist, als ich gedacht und neulich in einem Gespräch mit meiner Schwester behauptet hatte. Ich gebe ihr darum jetzt in Gedanken Recht, während ich die Auffahrt zum Hof hinauffahre, zum ersten Mal in meinem Leben selber steuernd. Alles gelingt gut, doch vor der Wand des Hauses, weiss ich zwar, wie ich den Wagen zum Stoppen bringen kann -- indem ich auf die Fussbremse trete und die Handbremse anziehe -, doch nicht, wie ich den Motor abstellen soll. Da beide Bremsen den Wagen nicht ganz halten, bewegt er sich langsam aber sicher auf die Hauswand zu -- ich bedenke schon, den Arm auszustrecken, um in so mit der Kraft des Armes von einem Aufprall abzuhalten, denn ich weiss, dass schon bei geringer Geschwindigkeit ein Anprall schwere Zerstörung hervorrufen kann. Allerlei Mönche gehen vorbei, ohne mir helfen zu können. Dann bricht die Szene irgendwie ab. Später, in einem Gespräch sage ich zu meinem Begleiter: "Jetzt weiss ich, wie ich den Motor hätte abstellen können. Ich hätte die Gangschaltung auf Null schalten müssen und den Schlüssel abziehen." Andere Szene: Eine Bulldogge will mir zu Leibe am Eingang zu einem ländlichen Gebäude, wohl eine Art Scheune. Ich versuche, sie mit den Augen zu bannen. Schliesslich gelingt es mir, durch einen ausgestreckt zeigenden Arm sie zum Fortgehen zu zwingen, und durch eine grosse Seitentüre zu entwischen, die ich dann gerade noch schliessen kann, doch hat der Hund ein Loch in halber Höhe in der Wand gefunden, durch das er sofort wieder hineinspringt. Andere Szene: Ähnlich: Ich liege. Jenseits der Wand sind Katzen, die plötzlich in Massen durch die Wand kriechen und mit ihren Krallen mit mir spielen wollen. Andere Szene: Treffe Krischan bei meinem Bruder. Da dieser aber immerzu erzählt, kommen wir kaum dazu, ein Wort zu wechseln. (664 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0830 (1952-03-22 - Freiburg)Gespräch mit der Baumgärtnerin über Fahrten im ewigen Schnee (die ich dabei zugleich sehe).

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0832 (1952-03-23 - Freiburg)Ich esse ein Ei, wohl ein Spiegelei, in dem ein hartes Stück drin ist. Eine Nonne, die wie eine Kindergartentante oder die Kochschwester in der Mensa ist, sagt zu mir: "Das kann man nicht mitessen, das ist vom Puter" Ich begucke das Stück, das wie ein Pfannkuchenstück im Ei aussieht und, wenn man es mit dem Löffel betastet, durchaus essbar scheint, und sage: "Ich glaube das kann ich ruhig mitessen". Sie guckt mich gross und verständig an und sagt noch einmal: "Das kann man nicht essen, das ist vom Puter." Jetzt leuchtet mir ein, dass es irgend ein Hautfetzen sein muss, der bei der Befruchtung mit in das Ei gekommen ist, und dass man es wirklich nicht essen kann. Ich sage: "Nun habe ich es kapiert", zugleich überläuft mich ein kalter Schauder. Die Szene wechselt. Ich ziehe ein riesenhaftes Ei sozusagen aus dem Leib der Pute heraus. Es ist so sehr in den Leib eingepasst, dass es sozusagen birnenförmig ist. Die Schale ist ungeheuer dünn und porös rauh, und als ich das Ei hochhebe, zerplatzt es und, wie das Ganze hinabfällt, wenn man ein Ei in die Pfanne schlägt, fällt wiederum ein Ei mit Schale herab, ebenfalls riesengross, aber in richtiger ovaler Form ohne den Ansatz. Ich erhebe auch dieses, das ebenfalls eine sehr dünne Schale hat und zerplatzt, und nun fällt der essbare Teil herab, dessen riesenhafte Masse, Eiweiss und Eigelb, ich zu verzehren beginne, wobei mir allmählich schlecht wird. Der Zusammenhang mit den Fetzen, den ich im ersten Ei fand, und der Doppelschaligkeit wurde mir sofort klar. Ich bin während des Essens zuletzt in einer Art Wohnwagen, der in einem Garten steht, an dessen Rande ein Wall, auf dem ich gackernde Hühner und einen Puter sehe. In dem Garten sitzt meine Cousine Gerda an einem Tisch unter einem Baum und flickt etwas für mich, obwohl es regnet. Sie sagt, sie sässe gerne da, denn drinnen wäre Besuch, und sie wäre lieber allein und hier in den Regen würde ihr gewiss niemand folgen. Andere Szene: Anhalterfahren. Zunächst in einem Autobus, dann hat mir jemand ein altes Auto geschenkt, im Typ wie Benders Wagen. Obwohl ich gar nicht fahren kann, fahre ich damit einfach los, und es gelingt mir gut. An einem Strassenteil, auf dem die eine Seite der Fahrbahn wegen Bauarbeiten abgesperrt und der Verkehr sehr eng ist, versuche ich rechts herum über einen Platz auszuweichen, sehe aber schon beim Einfahren, dass das nicht zum Ziele führt, schlage eine elegante grosse Kurve und kann dann schräg auf die Verkehrsstrasse wieder einfahren, muss dabei über einen Mantel, der dort wie auf einem Tisch ausgebreitet liegt, hinwegfahren. Das Ganze gelingt mir gut. Ich sehe daran, dass ich das Fahren gelernt habe. Andere Szene: Bender hält eine Vorlesung über Pommer'sche Schlösser, bei der auch Heiss zuhört. Er erzählt von ihrer Bauart, dem Material ihres Steins, doch zuweilen kann er seine Handschrift nicht lesen, er ist schlecht vorbereitet. Ich finde es schade, gerade, wo Heiss zuhört. Andere Szene: Heiss leiht sich ein dickes Buch von mir, von einem Autor mit dem Namen Schmuggler, eine Erzählung, die irgendwie das selbe ist wie der Inhalt von Benders Vorlesung. Der Einband des Buches ist hell. Es liegt ein Zettel in dem Buch. (536 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0833 (1952-03-24 - Freiburg)Traum von Gisela. Auf einem Fest mit meinen Freunden, bei dem sie trunken war. Das zeigte sich, indem sich plötzlich ihre Bewegungen veränderten und ekstatisch wurden. Ich begleitete sie heraus, weil sie spucken musste -- durch einen langen Korridor ihrer elterlichen Wohnung, der dann um die Ecke bog und zum Badezimmer und den Schlafzimmern führte. Ihr Vater schenkte mir etwas, ein Paket Seife. Ich sah daran, dass er mich wieder aufgenommen hatte. (72 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0834 (1952-03-24 - Freiburg)Schwerer Nachmittagsschlaf. Solch ein Nachmittagsschlaf kann sein wie ein Becher schweren Rotweins. Durchzuckt von Blitzen und von Farbigkeit. Hier war ich einerseits bei meinem Vater, der schon krank war, und Emmi und meiner Schwester voller Traurigkeit. Emmi sah dabei aus wie aus den Bildern in der Akademie, die ich heute sah, wo ich wieder gemalt werde. Sie hatte Augen wie das Bild, das Frl. Dickreuter von mir und wie das, das sie von einer Frau gemacht hat. Überhaupt waren es die Farben und Linien ihrer Bilder, die den Traum durchwalteten. -- Gleichzeitig die Ereignisse meiner letzten Anhalterreise, die ich in den Pausen des Modellstehens meinem Onkel (Vaters Bruder) in einem Brief geschildert hatte. Überhaupt war ich Vagabund in dem Traum. Gleichzeitig ragte das Leben Trudels wie eine grosse unbekannte Landschaft in den Traum hinein, der sie erwartete. Die Verschlingung der Bezüge war vielfältig. Über meinem Bett hängt ein Bild meiner Mutter. Die Wand ist mit einem Holzgestänge (zur Bildung von Fächern) kassettenartig überzogen. In einem dieser Raumkassetten sozusagen hängt das Bild. In einem kurzen Einbruch des Tagesbildes in den Schlaf sah ich es zugleich verdoppelt in der nachbarlichen Kassette, doch in der Szene so, dass diese schräge, leicht geneigte Wand den waagerechten, etwas steigenden Boden bildete, über den ich hinwegtastete, um in ein Schiff zu kommen, meine in Wahrheit waagerechte Lage im Bett aber als aufgerichtet - in der Stellung des hastenden Läufers - empfunden wurde. Das ist eine Erscheinung, die charakteristisch ist für die Nachmittagsträume: wie die Bilder der Umwelt, die durch die Lider, oder ihr kurzes Aufschlagen hineindringen, eingewoben werden in den Traum, doch ohne Rücksicht auf oben und unten, senkrecht und waagerecht, das heisst auf die Schwerkraft. Die Traumszene war, dass ich vor einer Tür, durch die man, wie durch eine Sperre auf den Bahnsteig, im letzten Moment an das Ufer gelassen wurde, auf ein Schiff wartete. Das Schiff erschien schon -- andere hatten es über den Holzzaun gesehen. Man vergass, uns die Tür zu öffnen. Einer klingelte. Dann sprang sie auf. Ich war im Augenblick wie gelähmt, wie halb umnachtet -- riss die Augen auf -- sah die Bilder meiner Mutter und das Gestänge -- erkannte darin meine Welt und hastete wie ein Nachtwandler darüber hinweg, blitzschnell erfassend, wo ich hintreten durfte ohne etwas zu zerstören. -- Dann war, wohl auf dem Umweg über das Bild meiner Mutter -- mein Vater in das Bild einbezogen -- wohnend bei meiner Schwester. Ich auf der Reise -- als Vagabund -- nach Frankfurt (dahin sollte wohl das Schiff führen), wo aber nicht Ika, sondern Trudel war. (An Ika schrieb ich heute Morgen an der Akademie). -- Zugleich kehrte ich wieder zu Emmi und meiner Schwester zurück, obwohl ich mich von meinem Vater getrennt hatte -- aber nur, um dort zu übernachten. Bei meiner Rückkehr sah Emmi so traurig aus, wie eines der Bilder von heute Morgen. (477 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0837 (1952-03-27 - Freiburg)Traum von einem sehr intelligenten und sympathischen Russen, einem jungen Offizier, mit dem ich ein Stück des Weges ging. Er nannte mich "Dellev". Es war im Osten -- die Szene jedoch wie in Freiburg. Ich kam eine Strasse, die der Mozartstrasse glich, hinab und wollte geradeaus weitergehen (Schlossbergstrasse). Dann hörte ich aber, wie jemand einem Kleinmotorradfahrer, der dort hineinfuhr, nachrief: "Da dürfen Sie nicht fahren, Professor, sonst kommen Sie nicht nach Kassel." Ich sah russische Posten in der Strasse und wusste, dass die Russen dort ihr Hauptquartier hatten. So wäre der Mann nach Russland gekommen (deportiert). Ich bog also nach rechts ab (Karlsplatz), in der Absicht, die nächste Parallelstrasse (Herrenstrasse) zu gehen. -- Während ich auf dem Karlsplatz gehend in meinem westlichen Pass blätterte, bemerkt mich der junge Russe, spricht mich darauf an, und wir wechseln ein paar Worte, die ihn mir sympathisch machen. Dann bleiben wir von einem Baume stehen, an dem russische Strick- und Stickarbeiten ausgestellt sind, von denen mir einige in Material und Farbtönung besonders gut gefallen, was ich sage. Dann kommen andere Leute, die diese Dinge in überschwenglichen Tönen loben, nur um sich einzuschmeicheln. Ich merke, wie das auch dem Russen lächerlich erscheint. Wir sprechen dann noch einiges, dessen Inhalt ich leider vergass. (207 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0838 (1952-03-28 - Freiburg)Traum von Nicolai Hartmann. Ich traf ihn und seine Frau in tiefer Trauer. Wir, das heisst einige andere Seminarangehörige und ich, mussten sofort ins Nebenzimmer gehen. Hartmanns Frau war ganz in Schwarz gekleidet. Er konnte keinen Besuch ertragen. Dann kam er in das Nebenzimmer und hielt eine Abschieds- oder Erinnerungsrede, in der er sagte: "Die Theorie (theoria) ist das Wesen das Lebens." Dieser Satz ergriff mich tief, denn ich sah die Übereinstimmung mit dem, was Heidegger über Hegel sagt, von der Skepsis am Sein, als der Schau ins Sein des Seienden als des Erscheinens des Erscheinenden. Ich verstand den Satz Hartmanns in dem Traum in der ganzen Schwere und Bedeutsamkeit jeden Wortes, mit der die Sätze Heideggers zu lesen sind. So bedeutete der Satz nicht die Theorie im landläufigen Sinn und nicht das Leben im landläufigen Sinn, sondern theoria in jenem Ursinn, in dem das Sein im Schauen west und Leben in jenem Ursinn, in dem alles Seiende Leben ist. -- Dieses Verständnis des Satzes ist auch nicht nachträglich in den Traum hineingedeutet, sondern es war gerade das Kernstück des Traums, die bis zu Tränen führende Freude in der Einsicht der Übereinstimmung des Denkens, das aus diesem Satzes spricht, mit dem Denken Hegels und Nietzsches, wie es in den Holzwegen dargestellt wird. Ich habe in diesem Buch mit grosser und irgendwie beglückter Sammlung in den letzten Tagen gelesen. Anderes Traumbild: Ich sah ein aufgehängtes Wäschestück (wohl ein Handtuch, das von vielen Besitzern mit Buchstaben gezeichnet war, ausserdem mit ausgeschriebenen Namen: Nicolai Hartmann, Helmuth Plessner, Robert Heiss, Detlev v. Uslar). Der Zusammenhang kam mir vertraut vor. -- Dann eine Traumszene, in der ich bei Hartmanns zu Gast war. Liesels Platz am Tisch war frei, weil sie verreist war. Die Mutter sprach von ihr als ihrer Tochter. Ich sagte: "Ja - Liesel". Andere Traumszene: Ein Seminar bei Heiss. Es kommt auf einen Psychologen von auswärts die Rede, der aber als Gast anwesend ist und neben mir sitzt. Jemand, der das nicht weiss, fragt Heiss nach ihm und seiner Denk- und Arbeitsweise. Heiss antwortet verschmitzt, dabei ihn anschauend: "Er schafft das mit seinem glänzenden Gedächtnis, weniger mit seinem Verstehen, das ist er bei dem da -- mich anschauend --, wie heisst er doch, ich habe seinen Namen vergessen." Ich spüre genau, dass er mich meint, fühle mich aber doch irgendwie unsicher und kann den Kontakt nicht finden, um ihm meinen Namen zu nennen. (400 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0842 (1952-04-01 - Freiburg)Traum von zwei Mädchen, die erste war blond, weich und bergend, die andere schwarz und temperamentvoll, trug den Pullover direkt auf der nackten Haut. Wir wollten -- es waren Strassenzüge wie in Schwerin -- in eine etwas abgelegene Seitenstrasse (Baaderstrasse) und mussten dafür von der Hauptstrasse (Königstrasse) links abbiegen. Doch an der Ecke sollte ein Schutzmann stehen, der den Weg versperrt. So mussten wir schon vorher durch eine der seitlichen Gassen abbiegen, die über einen abgelegenen Markt führten (hinter dem Rathaus). Auf einen solchen Eingang achtend schlenderten wir durch die Strassen. Doch das Mädchen, das ganz der "Antje" vom Fasching glich (die auch ein samtenes Kostüm trug, das dort wo man beim Tanzen führt, den Rücken freigab) bog verschmitzt in einen Gang ein, der in Treppen zwischen Schaufenstern hinauf in obere Etagen führte, dann wurde das Ganze wie zu einer Achterbahn beim Zirkus, auf deren Sitzen wir schliesslich hoch und beinahe frei im Raum hockten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0847 (1952-04-10 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Indianern. Einer unter ihnen -- ich spiele seine Rolle -- hat von Europäern eine Axt erworben. Man sieht während der Szene einmal über einem Dachgiebel ein wolliges federartiges Zeug herüberkommen. Ich halte es zuerst für gefährlich, sehe dann aber, dass es ein Schmuck, wohl eines kultischen Spiels, ist. Ich höre dann, dass die anderen Indianer den einen wegen der Erwerbung der Axt jetzt vergöttern. Ich gehe in das Zelt des Stammesältesten und habe Angst, dass er um seine Stellung fürchten und mit mir kämpfen wird. Er tritt heraus mit einem Kuchenbrot in der Hand, um mir seine Gastfreundschaft anzubieten. Ich erkenne die Geste nicht sofort und fahre unwillkürlich mit der Hand an den Gürtel, in dem die Axt steckt. Er ist traurig ob dieser Gebärde und kehrt resigniert in sein Zelt zurück, um seine Waffe zu holen. Ich sage ihm, dass allein die Angst mein Motiv gewesen sei, und versuche, seine Trauer zu versöhnen. Andere Szene, die mir nur sehr bruchstückhaft in Erinnerung ist: Ich komme in einen Betrieb, in dem der Besitzer, mit dem ich verwandt oder bekannt bin, nicht viel zu sagen hat. Es ist ein gehöftartiger Gebäudekomplex. Auf der Strasse ist es dreckig. Weisser Abfall. Wir treten in die Tür in eine Art Wirtschaft. Dort herrscht eine Wirtschafterin, die macht, was sie will. Sie nimmt kaum Notiz von dem Besitzer und fragt mich: "Was wünschen Sie?" Ich antworte sehr bestimmt: "Ich wünsche einen Aufnehmer, einen Eimer und einen ihrer Gesellen." Sie gibt mir ein Mädchen, eine ihrer beiden Gesellinnen mit, die mir sehr gut gefällt. Wir gehen hinaus, finden aber die Pfütze nicht mehr. Bei näherem Zusehen erweist sich die Sache als eine komplizierte Einrichtung, bei der die Bewohner ihren Abfall durch ein trichterartiges Gebilde in einen Schacht werfen, der mit einem Strassenbau -- sozusagen einer unterirdischen Strasse -- zusammenhängt, in der die Dinge, auch das weisse Zeugs, das wir gesehen hatten, verschwinden. Ich kehre etwas bedripst wegen der Blamage zurück. Andere Traumszene: Ernüchterndes endloses Gespräch. Andere Szene: Ich erzähle Dolo, das Deckbett sei zu schwer gewesen. Ihre Antwort: "Wir schlafen immer unter solchen Deckbetten." Zuletzt: Traum von einer schwarz-rot-weiss-grün gezeichneten Schale, die Ika in der Hand hatte. Der Grund war von schwarzer Glasur, die rot-weiss-grüne Zeichnung stellte wohl Jagdszenen dar. Die Grundform war rechteckig. (380 words)

Anderes Traumstück: Bekanntschaft mit einer Familie und deren Tochter. Die verschiedenen Anlässe dieser Bekanntschaft, die ich vergessen habe, waren in dem Traum ausgeführt. Es spielte in beiden Traumszenen eine sehr freie und leibnahe Atmosphäre. So spielte das unbefangene und sehr lange Wasserlassen darin eine Rolle, das zugleich ein Beweis der Freiheit und der Kraft war. Die Wohnung der Familie irgendwie fahrzeugartig. Das Essen spielte ebenfalls eine grosse Rolle -- vor allem von Kuchen und Schokolade. Andere Traumszene: Vom Modellstehen. Während der Zeichenprofessor etwas an meiner Nase zeigen wollte, kam Prof. Köhler herein und sagte: "Nur nicht die Nase berühren, wissen Sie nicht, dass es dann eine Stupsnase gibt?" Ich dachte: Die armen Chinesen, dann können Sie ja gar keine Nasenküsse geben. (137 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0849 (1952-04-13 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Nicolai Hartmann und Heidegger. Zuerst die letzten Vorlesungen von Hartmann. Eines Tages hatte ich gefehlt. Die nächste Vorlesung konnte er nicht mehr halten, weil er am Herzschlag gestorben war. Dann ein Buch, in dem über Nicolai Hartmann und seine Philosophie berichtet war und er gegen Heidegger herausgestrichen wurde. Dann vom Heidegger-Seminar. Ich ging an dem Raum vorbei, in dem er seine Seminare hält, sah einige der Teilnehmer herauskommen und ihn selbst drinnen stehen. Ich fürchtete, eine Seminarsitzung verpasst zu haben, erfuhr aber, dass es nur eine technische Besprechung war. (91 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0850 (1952-04-14 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Franz Schu. Der Gutsherr gab ihm völlige Narrenfreiheit, und er durfte sagen, was er wollte. So hatte er ein Schild geschrieben: "Wir arbeiten nicht hier, wir fahren nicht nach Kiel, wir spielen nur herum". Der Gutsherr hatte darunter geschrieben: "Entschuldigung und Freiheit" und seine Unterschrift. Er nahm, was auf ihn gemünzt war, mit Humor hin. Andere Szene: Zugleich Kunstakademie, Töpferei und Universität: Wie vor dem Modellstehen konnte ich eine Zeit lang mit Nichtstun verbringen, weil noch niemand von den Malern da war. Dann kamen diese und zugleich der Professor. Das war aber nicht ein Mal-Professor, sondern Professor Heiss, mein Doktorvater. Ich tat nun selbst sehr geschäftig, um zu tun, als ob wir schon lange an der Arbeit wären. Zuletzt rechnete ich Zettel zusammen in der Form eines Pfistertest-Formulars, auf denen aber vermerkt war, dass eine Kollegin wegen "innerer Zwistigkeiten in der Werkstatt" so und so viele nicht ausgerechnet hatte und mir das übergeben hatte. Die Meisterin (Monika Maetzel) fand diesen Vermerk albern. (164 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0851 (1952-04-15 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Gisela. Sie stand plötzlich hier vor der Dielentür auf der Terrasse vor dem Haus in ihrem Russenkleid. Dolo, obwohl sie sie nie gesehen hat, erkannte sie sofort und sagte: "Da ist ja Gisela". Gisela, die mit einem Begleiter im Motorradanzug über eine Karte gebeugt war, guckte auf mit einem etwas unwilligen Gesicht, wie: "Still doch, ich will doch etwas überraschen." Ich sagte zunächst: "Was machen wir nun," weil doch gerade Ika hier gewesen war und es nun sehr schwer sein würde, auch Gisela, die ja Feeli aus Göttingen kennt, bei Mölöchen einzuführen und hier übernachten zu lassen. -- Dolo sagte nur: "Und machst Du gar nichts?", weil ich noch immer auf der Diele stand und nicht gleich hinaus stürzte. Andere Traumszene: Spielt im Gebirge im Grenzgebiet. Es ist die Schweizer Grenze wie bei Tante Lu am Oberrhein (Rötteln), aber Berge und Panorama wie in Bayrischzell bei Adelheid, dicht an der österreichischen Grenze, Personen jedoch wie in Wittmoldt. Man sieht in das Nachbarland und seine Berge hinein. Die verschiedenen Menschen, Tante Jusi und Kaili und andere begeben sich in verschiedene Richtungen in das Nachbarland, die wir mit den Augen verfolgen. (191 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0853 (1952-04-16 - Wittmoldt)Autofahrt mit einem Jeep mit Werner Buchholz. Als es einen steilen Berg hinab geht, stellt er fest: "Unser linkes Hinterrad ist lose". Wir bereiten uns beide auf einen Unfall vor. Ich wundere mich nur, wie ruhig ich bin. Ich strecke nur die Beine und suche, mich zu entspannen. Wir sitzen merkwürdigerweise beide hinten. Er bringt den Wagen sehr langsam und vorsichtig am Strassenrand zum Stehen. Andere Szene: Fahrt im Flugzeug. Wir steigen steil auf, um über die Sturmsphäre zu kommen, die über Asien liegt, das wir am äussersten Ostzipfel Sibiriens berühren. Dann nach einer Fahrt, die mir sehr kurz erscheint, tauchen wir durch die Wolken hinab und haben eine leuchtende Landschaft unter uns, in der wir landen. Es ist die Stadt Charkow, in der wir spazieren gehen, und die, wie ich von den anderen erfahre, in Rumänien liegt. Ich lese viele deutsche Namen an den Türschildern, unter anderem den Namen von dem Knesebeck. Wir gingen auf eine Anhöhe, von der aus man einen wunderbaren Ausblick hatte auf einen blauen See oder die See. Ich fühlte mich sehr zu Hause -- auch durch die vielen Deutsch sprechenden dort. Andere Szene: Bei Maetzels. Herr Maetzel malt an einem Teppichentwurf, den er auf ein grosses Podium skizziert, das aus einfachen Treppen gezimmert im Zimmer steht. Zunächst hat er nur die Figur mit farbigen Linien angedeutet und die Farben mit Bleistift hineingeschrieben. Es gefällt mir sehr gut. Monika zeigt es mir. Später malt er mit wenigen, sehr schnell gezogenen Strichen auf eine Wandtafel mit Kreide eine Schlange, die in ihrer Gestalt im Carré gelagert zugleich irgendwie ein Haus darstellt. Es werden dann noch die Tropfen oder Bissen, die ihr aus dem Munde fallen, dargestellt durch Kreise im Wasser, das unter ihrem Kopfe ist. Ich ziehe diese Kreise mit der Kreide, sehr schnell erfassend, was Herr Maetzel will. Dann sitzen hinten in einem Türrahmen (der ganze Traum spielt in einer Art Diele) zwei Jungens, die Ika auch gut gefallen, und die dort irgendwie zur Familie gehören. Sie haben ganz lange, oben glatte und hinten wie ein Panzerhemd um den Kopf herum geflochtene Haare, die nur in einem schildförmigen Ausschnitt das Gesicht frei lassen, oben über der Stirn sind sie zum Pony geschnitten. Das Ganze wirkt wie Prinz Eisenherz im Kettenpanzer. Ich sitze bei ihnen, betrachte ihre Gesichter. Sie fragen mich, ob ich wisse, was auf die Tür zu Herrn Maetzels Atelier, die gegenüber von der Diele abgeht, gemalt sei. Ich sage: "Eine Töpferei" (wie in der Göttinger Töpferei) und auf die Seite: eine Palette. Im Erwachen denke ich, die Jungen könnten verkleidete Mädchen sein. (429 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0854 (1952-04-17 - Wittmoldt)Ich lag krank im Hause einer älteren, mir befreundeten Dame, die in ihrem Wesen Züge von der Baumgärtnerin trug, gleichzeitig aber etwas Gesetzteres, Ruhigeres, weniger Bewegliches, doch ebenso Vertrauliches an sich trug. In dem Wohnzimmer, in dem ich lag, hatten sich um meine Couch, wie es bei einer Krankheit ist, allerlei Dinge angesammelt, so eine kleine Kommode in der Mitte neben dem Bett, etwa in Hüfthöhe, auf der die Speisen abgestellt wurden und anderes. Ein männlicher Verwandter nun, der die pedantischen Züge von Heinz B. (einem angeheirateten Vetter) und zugleich ein wenig die geistigeren, aber ebenfalls etwas gespannten von B.M. (der Jurist ist) räumte mir alle diese Gegenstände weg, weil sie seine Ordnung störten, und wollte mich schliesslich in ein kaltes Zimmer irgendwo abseits legen. Ich schlug zuletzt mit einem Tuch im Kreise um mich, um ihn zu verscheuchen und klagte dann mein Leid der alten Dame, die es verstand. Andere Traumszene vom alten Herrn Maetzel, der ein winziges Auto hatte, so gross wie eine Sänfte, mit dem er sehr flink und wendig fuhr. Er öffnete dann die grossen weissen Türflügel des Eingangsportals seines Hauses (das ein wenig wie Schloss Rötteln wirkte, so, dass er sehr repräsentativ aussah) und freute sich daran. Letzte Szene spielt auf dem Klo. Es sind jeweils viele Becken zusammen, nicht durch Wände getrennt. Ich suche lange nach einem für sich abgeschlossenen, bis ich merke, dass auch F. auf einem in der Reihe sitzt und das humorvoll nimmt. (242 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0855 (1952-04-17 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Ika. Wir wollten zusammen in einer Badewanne baden gehen. Es war aber sehr schwierig, die Tür abzuschliessen, weil das Schloss klemmte. Als es uns schliesslich gelungen war, merkten wir, dass die Tür gar keine Scharniere hatte und aus ihrer anderen Seite einfach aufklappbar war. Dann entdeckten wir aber einen Kette, mit der man sie in dreiviertel Höhe an beiden Seiten festmachen konnte, wobei man die Kette quer über die Tür spannte. Nun konnte man aber die Tür um ihre Querachse drehen und so hineinschauen. Schliesslich entdeckten wir einen Vorhang, den man vorziehen konnte, der aber nicht richtig schloss. Da beschlossen wir, trotzdem zu baden. Andere Szene: Ika hatte Besuch von einem Gott oder Halbgott in menschlicher Gestalt, den sie aber wohl nicht als solchen erkannte. Der gab ihr eine grosse ovale silberne Münze mit einem Bild von barocker Prägung. Dieses silberne Stück wirkte als Heckmünze. Das Geld aller Menschen, das sie Ika brachten, vermehrte sich. Sie konnte so auch ihren Schuldnern helfen, wenn sie ihr das Geld zurück brachten, vermehrte es sich so, dass sie ihnen noch mehr gab. Doch war das alles in dem Traum nicht so verständlich. Man spürte nur etwas von einer geheimnisvollen Fruchtbarkeit. Andere Szene: War hier irgendwie eingesponnen. Giselas Vater, wohl in der Figur des Halbgottes, hat etwas mit der silbernen Münze und zugleich mit der Musik zu tun, die überhaupt zusammenhängen. Zuletzt spielte ich selber an einem Flügel.

Sehr schön war die Linienführung des Bildes, die Verteilung von Licht und Schattenflächen, so das Licht auf dem Standbein, das eine gerade Linie bildet, darüber der Unterkörper in einer leicht geschwungen Biegung,
