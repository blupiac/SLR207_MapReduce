 long and climbed onto the counter and then it got really big and fat -- huge. Then there were these two little slugs crawling around and I wondered, "Where did they come from?" (92 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#14 I came into work and my manager was there. She was mad that I hadn't done the maids' schedule for next pay period, even though it wasn't my job. She started yelling at me and telling me that I needed to learn. I was so scared and I didn't know what to say. (53 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#15 I dreamt that I had a huge pimple on my face and I couldn't resist picking it. When I picked at it, this huge long white worm came out. I kept pulling at it and I could practically feel it coming out of my face. It was very long. (49 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#16 I am laying in bed and I feel little pricks at my legs. I stand up and start walking. Someone says, "You have blood on your legs." I take my hand and wipe the back of my legs, and my hand is covered in blood and there is this huge spider on my hand. I go to the mirror and all I can see are spider bites and blood covering the back of my legs. (75 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#17 I am in this huge auditorium and it is a celebration for our college graduation. However, everyone there is from my high school for a reunion to celebrate college graduation. Everyone was there. It was so big. Gwen (my best friend from high school) wasn't there, however. I remember sitting on my knees and I was wearing a tight skirt and it was pulled up so my underwear showed. Then a well-known TV host pulled it down and I wasn't embarrassed at all. Then at the front of the auditorium they were doing little skits and they called me down for one, but I didn't want to do it. Then someone told me it was a skit about the 60's and if you do it, you get a bong hit, so I did it. It was weird. I stood in line and when it got to be my turn, I walked up to this desk and signed a piece of paper that this boy gave me to sign. Then I went to get my bong hit. The bong was being passed around, so I walked around and saw so many people from my graduating class. Finally I found the bong and my friend came over with me. I asked him for a lighter and he gave it to me, but I couldn't get it to work at all, so I ended up having to use matches. (236 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#18 I am in this huge arena and it is packed with people. I am at the very top of the arena and I start walking down the aisle. As I get to the center, I realize that there is a concert going on. It is very crowded, I realize that the group is New Kids on the Block. They all looked so cute and I was so excited to be there. Then Joe from the band saw me and smiled. I was so happy. Then he pointed at me and walked down the stage stairs and took my hand. That's all I remember. (103 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#19 I was back in high school walking down the corridors during passing time. Everyone there was in college; all of my college friends were there, but none of my high school friends. I was trying to get to my math class, but I couldn't find it. I kept walking into all of the wrong rooms. (55 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#20 I am on my mom's boat and we are sailing in the bay, but Richard isn't there. Only my mom is working the sails. I am standing on the bow and the waves keep hitting me in the face, and I can taste the salt water. My mom calls me to help her with the sails, but I don't know what I am doing. So then I go back to the bow and look around. The weird thing about my dream is that I never really saw my mom. (89 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#21 I was watching Saturday Night Live and they were doing a parody of Fantasy Island. There were six huge muscular men holding back Tattoo. They were like those really butch gay men in leather and wearing black leather pants and vests. They won't let Tattoo go and he keeps saying, "Let me go, let me go, I need to go." Finally they let Tattoo go and he runs to this huge puff of smoke. Then Tattoo says to the men, "Do you see what happened? You didn't let me warn him." It was never stated, but the moral was that since Tattoo could not warn Ricardo Montablan about the plane, the plane hit him. (114 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#22 I was with Bob and we went to this hotel to meet with one of his friends. I think it was this guy Donald, and right after we met, we went into the bathroom and he laid over the bathtub and I gave him a blow job. It was very vague and I didn't actually do it, but in my mind I knew I was giving him a blow job. (70 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#23 I am at this party and Melanie is there. There are lots of people. I am going somewhere that Melanie's friend is going, so Melanie asks me if I'll take her friend for her. I said that I will let her know when I am leaving. I walk around this party and it is in such a big building. I walk down the stairs and then the building was also a store. I was looking through the soaps and some other girl in the aisle was looking for shower gel. She wanted Lemon cream flavored, but she couldn't find it, so she asked someone that worked there. They told her to go to Woolworth's and they might have that flavor. They said, "Look on the ground level at Woolworth's." Then I went to find Melanie and when I found her, I told her I was ready to go. She had decided that she was going to the place that I was going to. She asked me if I could still take her friend to where she needed to go. I said, "I will still take her, but we need to leave when I say I need to leave. I can't wait around for her all night," and Melanie said that it was no problem. (214 words)

Dahlia: concerns with appearance:#24 I was sitting at work, very bored, and no one was there, so I smoked some pot. Then I noticed that my boss was coming there soon. I knew I had to open doors and turn on the fans, but my boss came in before I could get around to it. When she walked into the office, she sniffed around and gave me a dirty look. She said I could leave, so I left, but I forgot my backpack. I didn't realize that I didn't have it until I was at the store. I went back to work and asked my manager for my backpack. She threw all of my books at me and I asked her if she looked through it. She had found my pot and was very angry. She said that they would have to have a big meeting about the problem. Then I was in this room with a bunch of people that I didn't know. (160 words)

David: teenage dreams:#1 (01/02/90)I was in the Grammar School playground, and this time Angela had taken off to somewhere in the school. So I ran over to Julie and asked her if she knew where Angela was, and she said: "I can't tell you that." At first I thought she was just being a bitch about it. But then I asked her why. Then she sort of laughed and said: "I haven't seen her all day. Why don't you talk to her brother over there?" So then I walked over to the bus stop. I was greeted by a 7-foot-tall giant of a dork who said: "Who the hell are you?" I said: "I'm David, have you seen Angela? He said, "Yeah, she's in the school building." I said, "Great," and started walking to the school. He stopped me, gave me a giant slab of masking tape rolled up to look like a joint the size of a cigar. He said, "first let's play some games." We both walked out into the street to a cone, then stood there until a truck came by. Then we'd wait until the truck was a little bit away, then we'd run into the bushes pretending to swear in Spanish. We did this five or six times, then I woke up. (214 words)

David: teenage dreams:#2 (01/13/90)Funny dream last night. Kinda hard to remember it all, except Steve and I were doing a lot of serious ass-kicking, and what's really funny, Michelle, who I haven't even given thought to in months, asked me out in this dream, in this soft, weak voice. I was either playing a video game or a pinball game, or I was kicking a soda machine that wouldn't give me its soda. Anyway, I was preoccupied, and when I heard her say "Wanna go out with me," I stopped with an amused look on my face, and, after a silence -- presumably I was thinking -- I said, "Sure, guess so." I woke up then at 9:30. (115 words)

David: teenage dreams:#3 (01/14/90)Last night I had a dream I was in Payless, wearing my boots. I was returning a pair of shoes, I don't know if I got a new one or not, but I was thinking about returning mine. (38 words)

David: teenage dreams:#4 (01/14/90)I was outside my house, at dusk, with Steve and Matt. I was wearing my boots. Also, Bill Murray was with us. we were running up and down the side of my road on that rise, like I used to do, when all of a sudden there were dogs. I remember my dog was there, and I knew the rest, but I can't remember them. Then I had a memory of something in a book (probably a hunting book) and I yelled something that made the dogs go away, but not before many bites by all of them. (98 words)

David: teenage dreams:#5 (01/14/90)I was in K-Mart, by some kind of loudspeaker. I popped in a King Diamond tape called "The Dark Side" and was playing "No Presents for Christmas". And in the beginning I was thinking about how "Santa Claus couldn't know about everyone, because it's physically impossible." I told Steve I played the song and he giggled. (56 words)

David: teenage dreams:#6 (01/25/90)I drove the Buick to the DMV to get it insured. (11 words)

David: teenage dreams:#7 (01/26/90)Our whole school went on this trip to Spain or France, I think, at any rate. The jet landed at the school, and everyone got out and went into the Pavillion. There were like 20 pay phones in there. I saw Angela walk towards the phones, I watched her for a sec, then cut in front of her. (58 words)

David: teenage dreams:#8 (02/18/90)It was nighttime, and cold; I could see my breath. I was an outcast because the friends I had chosen were not socially acceptable. I was condemned to walk along on the grass and concrete for an unknown time. All of a sudden I meet Angela along the way. For some unknown reason I asked her what her name was. We talked and walked for a good twenty minutes and had a great conversation going. I felt great. (78 words)

David: teenage dreams:#9 (03/02/90)For a while I dreamt I was having sex with Lisa and Cara. When we were done they sort of left and I hooked the modem up to my computer and I tried to call the BBS that was toll free. I never could make it through, and I set up a large "boat-anchor" TV. And I started watching a horror movie. It seemed all this was happening in the middle of the night. In the morning (in the dream) I went to B.J.'s house. I spent the night there, and every time I went out of the room to get water or something, I'd open the wrong door somewhere and my eyes would get to feast upon dead bodies and people and animals, all dead. Once I found Alice Cooper in a room with a 50's style band crowded in around him all behind tattered white sheets. All the people's skin was blue. The next morning I walked to Guitar Showcase. They were having a party there, and a guy named Heavy Harv was hosting. I pictured Heavy Harv as a 50 year old Mexican who wore 70's style clothes, with his shirt wide open. The funny thing was, they announced they were using Steve's records! I was hanging out by the wall, talking to some chick. I have no idea who it was, because in the dream, I never actually turned my head to look at her. I ended up buying something to hold pencils that cost eighty-nine cents. (251 words)

David: teenage dreams:#10 (04/13/90)There was this girl with long brown hair. She was pretty. She was dressed in these green sweatclothes. She was being a bitch because she was making fun of me and my friends and laughing at the same time. She had two friends with her. Finally I got tired of it, and I pulled out a strip of metal, a thick metal bar. I hit her with it gently but firmly three times on her sides, legs. Then I suddenly hit her on the back of the neck. It went halfway through and I pulled it out. There was no blood, just a dark line where it went in. Everybody but myself ran away from her. Then I woke up. (120 words)

David: teenage dreams:#11 (04/17/90)For some reason the school was at the Camp again. A bunch of girls from the school were doing a strip tease in the eating hall. It was pretty cool until Lisa noticed me watching, put her clothes back on and pushed me out of the room. (47 words)

David: teenage dreams:#12 (04/17/90)I had this other one where I was at that dead field where they're building the homes. It was pre-dusk, same time most of my dreams are. The dead field was still there, though, and Steve had parked a new trailer there. A new trailer! We hung out there and listened to records 'til twilight, then I had to go home. (61 words)

David: teenage dreams:#13 (06/16/90)I am in hell. It is a frozen, barren wasteland filled with screaming souls. The icy wind cut through my skin like daggers. Satan appears as a huge black cloud that demons flew around, changing from twisted shape to twisted shape. (41 words)

David: teenage dreams:#14 (06/20/90)I dreamt Mr. N had a gun, and was holding all the 6th grade teachers (but Mr. P) and a bunch of students hostage in his classroom. I think Mr. M owed money to Mr. N, so he got the hostages. He was getting ready to shoot James because Mr. M was taking too long. So Cara stopped him by stalling him. She stalled him right until this part ended. Then I dreamt I woke up, and went outside to play frisbee with my grandpa! It was on Green Drive, and I accidentally threw the frisbee over the highway near Green Drive. Right then Chris ("Smokey") came by. He was dressed up in a colorfully striped Dairy Queen uniform. He had a great big map and asked me for loose change! (131 words)

David: teenage dreams:#15 (06/10/91)Tim was in bed with two girls. I climbed in and did drugs with them. I was down by a lake. Richard was trying to drown me. There was an open garage. A black guy was running for his life towards it and Matt was chasing him. (47 words)

David: teenage dreams:#16 (05/17/92)Set in a desert, at night. I had taken a trip in an airplane with Amy. She was wearing the traditional desert garb, for fun it seems. I was wearing a coat. Apparently, we had broken some kind of law because we were about to be executed with guns by soldiers on a stretch of the desert. Time passes. Back in the desert. Amy and I have escaped execution somehow. Rumors reach me that Tara is also in the area, and has been attacked. I run into her eventually and seems she has been stripped of clothing, but not much else. I am angry that someone would do that. I provide her my coat. She is very flustered and I find that I have to comfort her. When she has calmed down, I find Amy and we all find refuge in a cave, in which we fall asleep. There is a moment of darkness, and then I wake up (for real). (161 words)

David: teenage dreams:#17 (05/17/92)I'm in the computer room at school, only the windows are gone. Mr. S is not there. Instead, there is some woman with very short hair. I scrawl a name that isn't mine on the wall with a pen, and wipe it off later. Later I am still at school, only now in the theater room. Mrs. P announces that she is going to try a musical rendition of her lesson. I tell her that I play the guitar, and will be happy to learn the guitar part. Amy is near me. She asks to be taught a few chords. (After class.) I teach her the chords A, C, and E. (111 words)

David: teenage dreams:#18 (07/22/92)Amy and I were together, watching some show on a couch, and she was massaging my back. (17 words)

David: teenage dreams:#19 (11/05/92)Heather and I were in the kitchen. She was sitting on the counter, speaking in Spanish. I tried to talk to her, but all that would come out was French. She jumped down and put her arms around me and kissed me, but we couldn't communicate. No matter how hard we tried, neither of us could understand what the other was saying, and for some reason, neither of us could force our lips to make English words. (77 words)

David: teenage dreams:#20 (01/22/93)I drove my car to school, and parked it behind the music building, right up next to the fence. I had something in my hand which my inner voice kept referring to as a Blitz, and I didn't want it. It looked a lot like a candybar. I rolled down my window and threw the Blitz out. The Blitz struck the fence with a hollow rattling sound and dropped from sight. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#21 (01/22/93)I was walking down Green Drive in the middle of the night, heading from Quik Stop back to home. It was raining very hard, and I was wearing a raincoat. I got to the shopping center, and I went into the parking lot. I looked around myself, and my attention centered upon Home Video. So I pulled a key out of my pocket and unlocked the door, pushing the door open and walking inside as I did so. The interior of this building was not much; it was about six feet square and looked like a repair shop for VCR's. Parts of VCR's lay strewn about the floor. I grabbed a movie, after much consideration, and left five dollars on the counter. My biggest concern at this point was to get back out with the movie in hand and yet not be suspected by the police as a theif. For some reason, I could not get back outside for a long time. This dream ended when I crossed the threshold into the parking lot. (174 words)

David: teenage dreams:#22 (01/22/93)In my last major dream, it was wartime. Rather, it was as though a war had passed, and I was the bodiless witness to the carnage. My attention focussed upon one poor man's bloody upper torso. His body had been ripped away from the waist down, and his eyes stared blankly into the void. He had a crewcut, and in portions of his facial skin, you could see the underlying skull. I could tell, from my astral vantage point, that he had begun to rot. 

Suddenly a dog came along. It was a small dog, perhaps six inches tall, opne foot long. Brown patches splotched its fur. I do not know whether the patches were natural or the result of some other occurrence. At any rate, the dog too took an interest in the carcass, and grabbed the man by the arm, dragging him along to wherever it was going. The dog dragged this man over hills and rocks, through fields and lakes, through forests and mountains. As the dog did all this, little bits and pieces of the man kept falling off- he was being eroded away. Finally the dog came to rest with the man's remains, and I realized that they were laying at my feet.

I knelt down and examined the man. He had been nearly completely decomposed; he now had no chest, with the notable exception of a few jagged ribs. His skull was nearly intact, but now he had no eyes. Most of his skin had fallen away, only leaving a large sheet covering his back (which was unusual, since the dog had been dragging the man along his back- not his frontside!) The man's arm's (now skeletl) were intact. During this examination, I left my own body and became a witness to the scene. I think I was watching from the point of view of the dog, because I was low to the ground. This dream self said: "Wait, there's been a mistake. This man is not quite dead yet!"

Then I was watching the scene from above my own head. I saw blood pulsing within the skin of the skeletal form, and I began thinking to myself: "Oh god. This is going to be like one of those cheesy horror movies where the skeleton comes to life and strangles the guy." but that was not what happened. Down there, I pulled out a gun and tried to shoot the skeleton, but the shot did not harm it. Its jaw worked, and it reached for an antenna which was laying nearby.

It aimed the antenna at me, and it pulled an imaginary trigger. My head was suddenly filled with the wrenching noise of a telephone's ring, and suddenly, I understood what the skelton was trying to show me. It was illustrating for me that men are forced to be like machines in war. Further, when machines perform their duties, it is like getting a phone call; they (the machines) always involve people in some way. Conversely, when a man is killed it is as though he is receiving a phone call from the gods. The man always finds a way to involve one of them in his death. Hah! (535 words)

David: teenage dreams:#23 (01/23/94)I had a school dream last night. It was actually kind of frustrating. I wanted to get my classes changed, but first, I wanted to get my geometry class changed back to Mr. St's. I suppose I was at someone else's house, and Mr. St called, to check on this person, to see if they were cutting class. I connected Mr. St to the parents of the household, and as I hung up, I commented: "You know, Mr. St *does* sound like Rush Limbaugh over the phone." 

"Thank you!" I heard him reply. Then I hit a button to hang up.

Then I was standing in a long line at his desk. All these people, including me, wanted to get back into his class. The line was so long, that I whipped out an entire steak dinner and began to eat it in line. By the time the line had gotten down to the last few people and me, I only had one bite left on my plate: some of the steak. So I bit into it. It was the worst, most god-awful steak I had ever had in my entire life, I was sure of it. It was dry, and tasted like roast beef. What's worse, as soon as I began chewing it, the bite expanded in my mouth and filled it with this awful roast beef stuff. I had to let everyone else go ahead of me, and I still wasn't able to talk by the time Mr. St had gotten up and left. So I fell asleep (in the dream), and when I woke up again, I was again at the end of a line. I stood up, and I found that my balance was so bad that I kept falling down every time I stood up. Again, by the time I had finally gotten my balance back, Mr. St had gotten up and left. That was frustrating. (321 words)

David: teenage dreams:#24 (01/24/94)My brother and I were standing outside of a giant green lake. I knew that this was a "sea world" kind of thing, where there were shows and stuff. At any rate, we were standing on a ledge which was perched over this giant pool with green water, and I noticed two people in the far corner of the lake: an old lady in a diving suit and my dad, talking to her. My brother, I guess, fancied himself a performer of some sort, and he was standing at the very edge of our ledge, threatening to jump into the lake at the next exhibit. I could see that he held in his hand several sheets of music, professionally printed, with each bar being two half-note chords, second-inversion ninth chords in C. Each chord was the same chord. I could see seaweed and other things floating around in the lake, and I decided to ask my brother whether jumping in was such a good idea; does he know how deep it is in there? 

My brother replied, insolently; "Of course I do! I know what I'm doing!"

So I laughed. The next show was going to be the killer whale show, and when it was announced, my brother hesitated, long enough to see a monstrous black shark-looking thing emerge from the water. The lake had, at some point, changed into an incredible swimming pool, but the water remained green, and everone remained where they were. My brother decided not to jump. He laughed kind of feebly, and said: "Oh, maybe you're right, David." Then he sort of faded away. The next thing I knew, I was in the water. The giant "killer whale" was coming towards me, but I didn't care, because killer whales are reputed to be harmless. I wouldn't drown, anyway, because I was walking on the water. So the giant killer whale careened at me, and I'm not sure what happened next, but at some point I ended up in the water, with the killer whale some distance away. I swam up, up, up, and the water followed me. The old lady in the suit warned me: "you're not going to want to have such a strong reaction to him."

It didn't help, anyway, because soon enough, the killer whale had pinned me against the towering pool wall and was trying earnestly to roll me into a pulp. I woke up feeling spasms in my back which simulated the way I felt in the dream. (418 words)

David: teenage dreams:#25 (01/25/94)Well, I don't remember any dreams, per se, but I do remember a vision of a stack of videos, all with blue covers, like the ones Home Video has, and they were all marked with X's. (36 words)

David: teenage dreams:#26 (12/14/94)Last night I had the most convoluted dream about Laura, Josh, Hannah, Grace, and Grace's poetry that she had written for Andy Warhol. In the dream, poetry was represented by these very geometric, and angular figures, with strange curves and endpoints. I tried to make a drawing of them when I woke up but didn't do it very well. Not least because they were 3-dimensional. You wrote them into the thin air with your pen. In the dream, I drew a "poem" from Hannah's chin, and I said: "You're a poet now!" We all laughed. I seem to remember the dream was mainly about looking for Laura. She was around, just hard to approach because she was elusive. (118 words)

David: teenage dreams:#27 (06/14/95)Alright. I'm in J City, but it's sometime way in the future, so the city is as big as Los Angeles. For some reason it's really warm and humid, and feels like San Antonio. The first few seconds of my dream are set in the daytime. I drive my car up to the top of this really big hill, and I come to an intersection where I can't make a right turn for some reason; it's a one way in the other direction or something... at any rate, the road is blocked off. So I park my car in this downtown section where all the buildings are sort of greenish. It reminds me of what I think of when I think "Jungle". The air is really, really humid. At any rate, I'm either looking around for a Chinese restaurant or my friend's house. I can't remember which but it may have been both. One way or another, I keep getting lost in this little tiny two-block area of huge green buildings, and this really attractive Italian woman comes around in front of me and says: "You're ----, aren't you?" She said some name, but it wasn't mine in real life. It was mine in the dream, though. So I said "Yes, I am." I probably would have agreed if she didn't say my name. She was absolutely gorgeous. 

Anyway, it's been nighttime for a few hours, dream time. I have not been able to find the Chinese restaurant. So the Italian woman takes me by the hand and leads me through all these wierd back streets among these green-tinted buildings and we finally arrive at this one nice looking house that looks sort of like a greenhouse with wooden frames. Plants are growing everywhere, and I keep hearing congo drums someplace. So I get into this house, and the woman sits me down in the kitchen, at the counter, on a stool, like it's a bar or something. Then, she just kind of disappears, not to return until later in the dream. I get pretty bored listening to the congo drums, and so I get up to look for the Italian woman. Then I find this little tiny room with an absolutely huge mattress on the ground, tons of congo drums everywhere, and a REAAAAAALLLLLY fat guy playing the congos.

So as soon as he sees me, he jumps up and shakes my hand. He's really sweaty. I almost don't want to touch his hand. He's wearing this white cotton T-shirt that doesn't quite fit, so his belly is just everywhere. It's really gross to look at, so I look away. Apparently this fat guy is some kind of amazing musician that gets paid millions an hour to play congos, and he has this entire house just for playing music. Or so he says.

So we go back out into the kitchen, and along the way, he loses about 200 pounds. For some reason, it doesn't matter that much to me when that happens. The Italian woman is back in the kitchen, now wearing an apron. Now a really good looking blond woman has joined her. The fat guy introduces me to them, but I can't remember their names. Now, this blond kinda skinny guy arrives on the scene. he has longish hair, and he looks a lot like the male version of the blond woman. So there's a few minutes of conversation, and the fat guy drops another whole load of fat, and now he's starting to look pretty average. He eventually suggests that we all go back into the bedroom, and we all go back into the bedroom. Then we all take off our clothes. A few moments ensue, which aren't really sexual on anyone's part, just a lot of kissing and stuff. Then, The fat guy, who by now looks great, and the skinny blondish guy have an announcement to make.

The by-now great looking guy says: "Well, the two of us are... straight," then they look at each other, "but we're gay, too."

The blond woman is obviously disgusted, and she says so: "Oh my god, that is so gross. Here, let me show you this." And she immediately produces a copy of "THE WIZARD OF OZ"!! She says, "Here, read the last three pages," and starts ranting. I refuse to read the last three pages, and she hits me over the head with the book. I put my clothes back on and kept looking for that Chinese restaurant. (753 words)

David: teenage dreams:#28 (09/01/95)I'm making out with Laura in my room and there's a bar of this white deodorant-like stuff. It's caky. This is supposed to be spermicide. She grabs it and we strip down. She rubs the "spermicide" all over her body, lays on the bed, cocks her pelvis upwards and claims: "I'm receptive!" But I've had to piss the whole time, so I tell her I'll go do that. But as I run for the bathroom I hear my family come home. I scramble and get the key for my room so I can get back in there without letting on there's someone in there, much less Laura in such a "receptive" mood. My brother asks me why I'm locking my room and I tell him bluntly that there are things in there I don't want him to see. I still have to urinate, but while I'm trying to lock the door, Nick uses the bathroom. My mother walks into the bathroom, and then walks back out, assuring me that there is "plenty of garbage" in that bathroom. By now, the feeling that I have to piss is so strong I feel I'll burst. My mother keeps going back into the bathroom and coming out, assuring me there's "plenty of garbage" in there. In frustration I finally just start pissing all over the walls in the hallway. (226 words)

David: teenage dreams:#29 (09/01/95)I dreamt I woke up at seven and got ready for school. I got in an argument with my brother and ended up one hour late for class. In between two classes I made a quick jaunt down the coast. (40 words)

David: teenage dreams:#30 (12/24/95)Something about the Capitol building in Washington DC. The stairs were greased. I also remember looking at photographs of a young, very attractive, mousy woman who was supposed to be named Cheryl. These were photographs of the young Cheryl, who supposedly was old and decrepit by now. (47 words)

David: teenage dreams:#31 (12/25/95)My father was searching for a job. I can't remember what happens next. I need to go to work, but my brother's walkman has a leak in it. And my car (actually Jimmy's hatchback) is "broken", though my Dad drives it down to the Chevron station to get it fixed. 

I need my car to get to work, but in the meantime, I go down to Jimmy's house for a bit. When I walk back up, there's some kind of bear/cat/monkey creature in the road. It has a dark, black face like a monkey, and sharp fangs and claws like a cat. It has light grey fur all over it's body, and bounds around on all fours. It is scared of me, so as I stroll up the road, it leaps up into the trees and walks back around me. I figured it was going to go back to eat the stalks of grass, so I didn't care much. But the next thing I knew, with a symphonic crash, the bear thing has bitten into my hand, and we are spinning around in a circle rapidly. We get into a huge struggle, but miraculously, I just get scratched up as if I were fighting a cat. The dust clears, and I somehow get the cat thing to call a truce. We start to walk up the road together, and it stands erect and turns into a human being. I comment, "I should have told you I wasn't going to hurt you. That might have saved you some trouble." He replied, "Yes. I would probably have gone right back to eating."

We get to my house and we walk over to the deck. Jimmy's waiting there for us. Just then my Dad re-surfaces in the car. My Dad walks over to me. He's wearing a dark blue uniform that looks like a policeman's uniform, or a military uniform. It is well fitting and has plenty of shiny brass buttons, as well as a short-brimmed policeman's style hat. He pushes his hat back on his head. The bear person disappears. I notice for the first time that over my Dad's right breast is a patch with an American flag and the Chevron symbol. "I got a job!" he says, "At Chevron! Although they're closed..."

"They're closed?! I have to get to work in..." I look at my wristwatch and see that I have half an hour before I must go to work. My Dad says, "That's O.K. Now that I've got a job there, I've got all the tools!" And then he immediately sets to work on my (Jimmy's) car.

Meanwhile, my cuts and bruises are just throbbing, so I rush down to the bathroom and strip naked so I can see what damage has been done. I am covered with shallow slices, all of which have already scabbed over. I still go for an application of Trisporic everywhere, which burns. I notice that my black mug is filled with mint tea, and I'm careful not to get any dandruff, hair, snot, blood, etc in it. I take a big gulp of it, and find that it's lukewarm. I remember that I left it there several days before, and marvel at the cup's ability to keep things warm. Then I search around in the medicine cabinet behind the mirror for painkiller pills, and I swallow them down with tea. Out loud, I say: "This really keeps things warm, I can't believe it! I left it here like a week ago and it's still warm!"

Next, for some reason, I pull out two large pieces of tinfoil, and suddenly feel the urge to put something repulsive in them. I start to throw up, but then I remember I just took some medicine, so throwing up for fun would just be a real waste of medicine. I stop myself just in time and manage to keep my stomach down. The next thing I consider is taking a shit in the tinfoil, but I discard that idea right away, because it would probably be too squishy and I would probably get some on my hands. I give up, and I start to crumple the foil together, when I suddenly get AN IDEA! I hock up, and attempt to spit out, an enormous mouth-sized snot and phlegm ball. It is spongy and porous. My revulsion at this repulsive choice wakes me up. (736 words)

David: teenage dreams:#32 (12/25/95)A massive quest for pornography. Everyone was searching for porn. It's too vague for me to remember, but I recall videos laying in the street, a magazine on a table. Then I ended up at the junior college library, which was a horseshoe shaped parking lot/cafe/criogenic freezing lab. Everything was dark and smoky. I walked up one of the aisles and noticed a coffee-and-muffins stand. I thought to myself: 'How hypocritical. This is just like a movie theater. They tell you to leave your food and drinks outside and then sell you coffee and muffins while you read.' I had dived into the 'library' to avoid Eric, an irritating friend. That's when I noticed the criogenic freezing slabs. There were five of them, and each had a Windows display on the side of the slab. The slabs were orange concrete, and the criogenically frozen people were all just laying on top of the big orange blocks, under a set of flashing sheets. Each block was numbered, but only four had people laying on top. The life status of these four were displayed on the Windows 'status bar'. This information was transmitted via wires in the flashing sheets. I then realized that these slabs weren't real at all, but a publicity stunt orchestrated by Devo. I laid down on the free one and pretended to be asleep, under the criogenic flashing glow-in-the-dark electronic Devo sheets. Eric came along and looked. "How long you been asleep, man?" he asks. I didn't respond. Someone told him to check out the display. Eric went away eventually, and I decided to get a book. I eventually found a copy of Finnegans Wake, only it was in this orange folio edition. It looked exactly like a book of methanol and ethanol emissions ratings that I had just returned. I ran around the library, waving this folio in hand, proclaiming: "Everybody should read this book! The questions to everything are in here!" The edition came off of somebody's typewriter. I opened it up to the first page, and recopied the bottom printed half onto the blank top half of the page, thinking all the while that "this page needs some filling." It occured to me that since Joyce was a Catholic, it's likely that some of the answers to the questions in Finnegans Wake are in the Bible. I search for a Bible in the library, but on the shelf in place of Bible, between two books, is a large, soft blueberry muffin, abandoned to fate. I eat it. (422 words)

David: teenage dreams:#33 (12/28/95)I lived in this strange house, where video games, toys and other inanimate objects came to life and mixed with the living. It started at school. I was going around, trying to take my finals. I get to my PE and Math finals, and look on my sheet of paper. Damn! They're being held at the same time! I take a look at the teacher's name. Patterson. This guy was the quintessential chaw-munchin football coachin' American bastard when I was in the 10th grade. I think, "He WOULD follow my to college and ruin my life. Just to ruin my life." So I run over to his final, do it very quickly, and then run all the way back across the campus to do my math final as quickly as possible. I remember that I've never been to the class, but I breeze through the material anyway. I hunt around in empty classrooms for mathbooks and dictionaries to steal. Once I've got my backpack loaded up with valuable "study materials", I'm all ready to go. 

All of a sudden, I realize I'm not at college at all but at home, and my parents have arrived with some Africans in tribal gear and colorful robes and neck rings, and are having tea with them. I stay downstairs, just so I don't have to deal with my family. Then, as usual, I have to go to the bathroom really bad, and I keep trying to piss in garbage cans. That doesn't work out too well. As I'm trying to find a garbage can to piss in, some person materializes out of nowhere, comes up to me, and shows me his "closet", which is filled with toys that come to life. To demonstrate, he activates one especially ugly one, and it nearly beats him to death. It gets me a little too, but I escape. (312 words)

David: teenage dreams:#34 (12/28/95)I dreamed that I was in some kind of medieval landscape, laying in the base of a cylindrical tower with my enemy. Guess it was a dungeon. We conversed for a while, very politely and pleasantly, but then, it suddenly came to him that I was after him and after a brief struggle, I leapt out of the dungeon-hole, knowing that he was superior. Everything melted, and the next thing I knew, I was in a supermarket. I see these four painted canvases of cavemen, in the Flintstones leopard-skins that hang on one shoulder, looking very strong, with the legend, "Christian Soldiers Unite!" written across them. Suddenly, all the canvasses of cavemen are lowered, and I see that they're being held up by two bare-chested boys and two bare-chested girls. But, as I get closer, I realize that they are all girls, as one of the older ones takes off her shirt. I find the Christian leader eventually, who's a middle aged man, and I ask him about the girls. He mumbles something, and I beat him up. My friend Bonnie sees this and she tells me that she is very impressed. (192 words)

David: teenage dreams:#35 (12/28/95)I'm walking around downtown in my raincoat and hat, not really knowing what to do. A woman comes up to me and asks me for change, but I remind her that she's already asked me twice today. She groans and takes off to a group across the street. "Wow!" I exclaim to myself, "Amy is over there!" I hadn't seen her since Junior High, so I walk over to her and say hello. She gives me a partial hug and we talk for a while. After a brief conversation, I pretend to be a Mafioso, and I look across the street at all the brand new seventeen story magnificent gleaming coffee places. I hop across the street, and take off my jacket. An old lady walks up, and I whisper something to her in Italian. She nods knowingly, and disappears. I put my coat back on, look around shiftily, and go inside and get an espresso. (156 words)

David: teenage dreams:#36 (12/29/95)I was standing upon a beach with a huge milling crowd of people. I didn't really know what was going on, but it seemed to be some sort of good-natured rock fight. People were picking rocks up and flinging them playfully at each other. They weren't pebbles either, they were ROCKS. Then, everybody started going crazy, and it was like a battle. People were throwing to kill. Talk about a shift. Then a gang called "VS" showed up, and things really got vicious. One girl got me good in the stomach with a big rock and I followed her around, determined to kill her. As it turns out, it was one of my brother's old friends, who he "hates" now. (120 words)

David: teenage dreams:#37 (12/30/95)An abstract dream: I dreamt about patterns, shapes, colors, and lights. (11 words)

David: teenage dreams:#38 (01/01/96)I'm sitting outside with my friends on a massive lawn. We are having a picnic or something. I suddenly realize, as I stand up, that when I press down on the raw earth, I can make sounds. Every time I push down on a place, it forces some air in air pockets out through the grains of dirt, and it makes a farting noise with a note to it, kind of like a tuba. After playing a bit of a song, the earth becomes seriously disturbed, and big rocks and chunks of brick lay everywhere. I guess we had too much fun. Music seems to emanate from beneath these bricks. After we replaced the earth, and I "play" it a few more times only to get the same results, we realize that the underground brick and concrete structure is part of a prison. In fact, the part where they put the most dangerous criminals, and we all struggle in vain to replace the bricks and concrete and dirt before it is too late and the prisoners escape and kill us!! The dreams ends when I jump off the ground and fly away. (192 words)

David: teenage dreams:#39 (01/02/96)The first thing I remember is a dream in which I was eating food out of somebody's hand. Now I'm sitting up in bed. My maternal grandfather appears at the foot of the bed, and asks me "Can you EVER forgive me?" 

I said, "Of course! if you hadn't been such a bastard, I wouldn't have had this life!"

Then he asks, "Is all my money going to end up in ... little pockets?"

I said, "I don't know." Then I apparently woke up, the alarm went off, and I was sitting in the office, kind of sweaty from sleeping in my clothes. It turns out that the alarm was actually the ringing telephone. It's the lunch hour. My supervisor, Ed, (middle aged balding guy with long hair, really greasy and wears glasses, very unclean person.) rushes in, getting things ready. He picks up the phone and begins to deal with the customers, and as usual, another line suddenly lit up, and I had to deal with this person. The person on the telephone was an old lady. An old, deaf lady trying to order some kind of lunch that wasn't on the damn lunch menu. Plus, she was talking too quietly. "I'm sorry, could you repeat yourself?" She muttered again. "I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Could you speak louder please?" She mutters again, and in vain I try to turn up the speaker on the phone. Finally I think "Why am I apologizing? SHE'S the one causing the communication problem!!" "GOD DAMMIT!" I yell. "SPEAK UP! I CAN'T HEAR YOU! CAN'T YOU TALK LOUDER?!" I thought, 'I hope El's put me on the clock for this.'

Finally Carrie, one of the drivers, comes in and gives me this look like, "Stupid customer, huh?" Then I really wake up. (300 words)

David: teenage dreams:#40 (01/03/96)I was scheduled to go to the city with Brad and Jimmy at five or six PM. I was getting ready to go when my brother came in needing help on some stupid class assignment. I helped him for a while, and when I looked at the clock again, it was 8:00pm, and too late to go. I yelled and I screamed and made a fuss. I went to the library, checked out, and read, a book on the various forms of fussmaking. And then my room was getting dark. The hair fell out of my picture of Grieg on the wall. Instead of striking me as odd, this just scared the shit out of me and I "woke up". I sat up in bed, leaned forward, and kind of examined the floor underneath the Greig picture. I turned on the light and everything. After I was finally satisfied that hair had not fallen out of the picture, I had a dream involving the little theater downtown. The theater had just gone out of business and the proprietors had turned it into an antique shop. I thought this was a disgrace. At the very least they could have turned it onto a film museum. (204 words)

David: teenage dreams:#41 (01/08/96)As I recall, it began when I needed to go over to Jimmy's house to do a report. I brought a book that I needed, but it turned out not to be enough, so I went upstairs (in Jimmy's house) to get a new book, setting down the jar of peanut butter I was suddenly, inexplicably holding. Jimmy's house dissolves into my house. Time passes. Night arrives. My parents come home, and we all start talking together. There is a party of some sort going on around us, and we hear a news report that the police are careening off to some crime. We get in our car and start down Green Drive, pausing to let the police pass when they do. Laura's in the car. We decide to follow the cops, and they lead us to the other end of town, where the K-Mart is, and there is a bank there. We walk inside, and a policeman announces. "Well folks, there's at least one dead teller. Of Penn and Teller." Sure enough, some guy is wired to a computer with lots of squiggly wires. But he doesn't look like Teller of Penn and Teller. Amusingly, he looks exactly like Edward Teller, the nuclear physicist. I think, very dramatically, "HOW to STOP this MONSTER?? AAAH YESS! PLAYING MUSIC OVER THE TELEPHONE!" 

I turn to my mother. "QUICK mom! What number combination WAS IT???"

Frantic, she screams, "THREE FIVE O! THREE FIVE O!!"

I run over to the payphone, and dial 350 and random music selections. I look over at the "Teller Machine", and realize with dismay that it is millions of years old. "DIIIIEEEE!!!" it whispers in a gravely voice. I immediately sense my mistake. A sinking terror overcomes me, and I wake up. Gee, I've never been menaced by an ancient physicist before! (304 words)

David: teenage dreams:#42 (01/15/96)Will's parents owned a bookstore. It was a popular hangout spot. I watched a video about the Iran Contra affair. At the end, they took 142 leaders from different countries and hung them twenty at a time from gigantic steel gallows. I thought, and said, "Gee, that's dumb! They didn't hang anybody from the United States!!" My mom overheard this, and we got into another one of those stupid political debates. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#43 (01/16/96)Typical travel dream. I tried to go, kept getting delayed, lost my money, as I was walking along the road I kept tripping over things, etc. etc. (27 words)

David: teenage dreams:#44 (01/21/96)I was listening to jazz, and I thought of the ancient skeleton found in Kenya, supposed to be the oldest human specimen ever found. And I thought, "we are all children of Africa!" Sometimes I have the tritest thoughts in dreams. (41 words)

David: teenage dreams:#45 (02/03/96)I was standing by the window in the living room looking down on the berry bushes, and suddenly acquired binocular telescopic vision. I zoomed into this big black spot I saw, and saw that it was a spider. But not a normal spider, NOOOOOOO. This spider was huge, first off. Maybe a foot across. Second, instead of having a globe shaped abdomen like normal spiders, it had a giant rectangular box. This disgusting thing was almost enough to wake me up. I drifted halfway up out of the dream (long enough to register the spider as a dream) and sank back down into it. Now a bee was crawling around in my right shoe. I was wearing my black boots, and the plastic toe shield had fallen off. I thought to myself, "Well, as long as I don't antagonize the bee, it'll be okay." I talk with my brother for a bit, and soon he asked me why I wasn't worried about the bee. I explained why, but no sooner had I finished, but the bee started stinging me over and over again on my fourth toe. I contracted my foot, to pull he tail off the bee, but I only succeeded in pulling the bee into my shoe. OH NO! Then I woke up. (215 words)

David: teenage dreams:#46 (05/01/96)I was making plans with Jimmy and Will to travel. They had just come back from a trip. I said "You know where'd be a cool place to go?" Everyone responded, "Europe!" So, we built a boat and sailed over. Yup, rolled up our sleeves and built a boat. We landed in some country after sailing the Ocean Blue. I guess it was France, because everybody was speaking French. I walked up to an office building, and hurt the feelings of an attractive woman, with long black hair and large breasts. I don't remember feeling very bad about it. We were standing in a place that looked like San Francisco, and along with all the people doing Tai-Chi, Napoleon was there! Yup, in his uniform. Getting very angry. We tried to change the language of the country so we could understand what was going on, but I did not succeed. For three seconds, I was in 1904 Dublin, standing on a bridge, across the river Liffey, watching a procession of people mentioned in *Ulysses*. Leopold Bloom leaned over to me and said, "Pity, isn't it, that they're all dead? Still, you can't argue with them I suppose." He then tried to sell me something for five pounds sixpence. Then, I was back in "France". The woman with large breasts was standing around trying to seduce Napoleon. We were very glad she was doing that, because Napoleon had gotten extremely annoying. (240 words)

David: teenage dreams:#47 (08/10/96)I was staying in a hotel with Laura and some other people. My family, her family, and a bunch of weirdoes. I was playing with this mechanical grabber thing. The kind you use to pick up repulsive garbage. We were all on the roof of the hotel, and I was playing with things down on the sidewalk with the grabber. It was very long, obviously. Suddenly, quite without meaning to, I picked up a tree and accidentally flung it into the road, where a little baby was standing. I almost killed it. I immediately slumped over onto the railing, not able to believe my stupididty. The mother, or one of the women down below, began to complain about me. She pointed at me and shook her hand and said in a hysterical voice "Well, ARISTOTLE over there just keeps playing in his happy world, he almost kills my baby!" 

I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned around to see Laura, and a tall slightly pudgy girl. Conveniently, at one corner of the roof, there was a large ... bed! So we went over to the bed, and stripped down, and just as we were all going to get into it, Laura said "Ohhh shit!" and pushed the pudgy girl off of her. "What?" we wondered. "My MOM!" Laura said. "I have to buy it for her."

"Can't you buy it later?!"

"NO. I have to buy it NOW. SHIT!" And she sprang up out of bed, got dressed, and ran downstairs.

The next thing I remember is seeing the ground below from an omniscient perspective, and the door that Laura had run through in a rush to buy "it" for her Mom. Another woman, looking like a character from Destinos (a really lame Spanish instruction series, like a soap opera) saw the door open and looked around. Cautiously, she walked in. Somehow, I knew about all this, and to keep her off the roof I locked the door. I don't know why I wanted to keep her off the roof, but apparently it was pretty important. She got out anyway, pushing open a different door that I didn't know about.

She led me inside to a very brownish room, and sat down in a chair. Suddenly "Jean-Paul Sartre" walks in. Only his head is HUGE, way out of proportion to his body, which is spindly and weak looking, and he's about four feet tall. And he doesn't speak French. He speaks English in a very raspy skater's voice. He goes over to the window and lights his pipe. He doesn't say anything philosophical at all in the entire speech he delivers at this point. Basically, this is how it goes. In a very laid back way, he pontificates about drinking beer, eating food, smoking, and fucking, pausing between each sentence to puff pondiferously on his pipe. Then, "Sartre" leads us to the banquet hall. There, everyone is eating food (surprisingly enough). All our families are there. All the waiters speak German ONLY. They're walking around service these pastries on silver hors d'oeuvres platters. These pastries are filled with eel chunks and sugar. I decide to eat one, because, after all, I'M IN PARIS!!!

PARIS. Suddenly, I was away from the hall, and virtually walking through a postcard. As I watched the sun rise over the Seine, "City of the Lost Children"-type carnival music came on in the background, and a cheesy radio announcer's voice came on as I walked through the sights.

"Paris." it intoned. "City of history and dreams. Henry Miller once wrote that 'Paris changes anybody who lives there for more than a year.'" (I had just read this phrase in a book by Ernest Hemingway, so in the dream I kind of laughed and thought, "yeah, they *would* get it wrong!") "On this side of the city, we have the historical city, the Seine." Flash to a picture of the river. "The Academie Francais." Another picture. "The Arc de Triomphe." Click. Then I was suddenly standing below an enormous bridge, which everybody had to cross, was really easy to fall off of, and which if you fell off of it, you'd die. It was constructed of this weird inflated doughy stuff, like high yeast bread dough that's been sitting for a few hours -- really porous and spongy. It had huge 20-story high arches. When you looked up from the base, you couldn't see the top. It was very steep. The colors were alternate stripes of yellow and blue, going all the way up. As I recall, there was supposed to be a flag at the top for those who made it. Remember this was a commuter's bridge, that everyone had to cross!

The voice intoned: "... This insane bridge." Then click to a picture of McDonalds. The voice said "Then, there's the other side of Paris. A dirtier side." Here the voice and music cut off and I was standing at a corner made by two blue walls. Suddenly I noticed an alley, and I started to walk down it, when two tiny little Pomeranians ran around the corner, yipping. One had the word GUARD spray painted in purple on its side. The other was painted with the word DOGS. So these were the GUARD DOGS. I started to walk by them, but they attacked me, and they were far too strong to fight, even though they were Pomeranians. I called out for help, but the painter guy, standing on a ladder and painting the wall, just turned around and laughed. I couldn't figure out whether he was laughing at my cries for help, the fact that I was crying for help from two sub-Chihuahuas, or the words painted on them. (Maybe he laughed because, after all, he's in PARIS!!!) At any rate, by the time the GUARD Pomeranian had eaten half of my leg off, the sensation became too realistic and I woke up. (991 words)

David: teenage dreams:#48 (08/18/96)A man gives his girlfriend a single joint. Somehow, they are caught, and after a long, absurd trial, they are given concurrent sentences, but special sentences. She is sentenced to live in a solitary cell for seven years and he is sentenced to bring her all of her meals. The catch? He can only eat once he's brought her the food, and he can only stay for five minutes. So, three times a day, he's faced with the decision: "should I stuff my face, or should I go hungry this morning and be able to talk to the woman I love?" BLAH!! Creepy dream. (104 words)

David: teenage dreams:#49 (09/16/96)First off, I was a friend of Jack Kerouac. He was trying to kill himself, and I was trying very desperately to keep him from committing suicide while trying to save a huge Glad bag filled with his manuscripts from the certain destruction he had consigned them to by putting them in the closet. Don't ask me the connection; I don't know what closets and certain destruction have to do with each other. Anyway, he succeeded in killing himself. I ended up rescuing only the manuscripts, because I decided he had written quite enough already. (95 words)

David: teenage dreams:#50 (10/19/96)The basic scene is a giant ship kind of setting, but it's still docked. My family and I are living on it, paying for our rooms. The telephone in my mom's car is ringing, and we're on the top floor of the ship, floor four. Jimmy and I try to convince Washington Sanders (a character from a book) to come with us on the "express" elevator but no, he's afraid of elevators. It goes to the second floor, where we have to get off and run across the ship to the other side to get to the bottom. My dad intercepts us and follows us. By now it's too late to get the phone and we just want the message they left. Washington wouldn't say anything but "no. no." and stare off into space. (134 words)

David: teenage dreams:#51 (10/19/96)A haircut. A bad haircut. What I remember here is going to the barbershop and asking for a little off the sides. Bastard gave me a mohawk. I actually kind of liked it but I refused to pay because he didn't respect my wishes. I woke up before anything real happened. (51 words)

David: teenage dreams:#52 (10/21/96)The town was bigger: I don't mean that in terms of more crap in town; but in terms of sheer *size*. Each block was very large. Incredible size. Remember the guy with frizzy hair who used to stand at the corner by parking garage, listening to his headphones and playing air guitar? He walked by, holding a small rectangular piece of paper, like a check, in his hand, whispering "yes! yes!" (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#53 (10/22/96)People had fixed middle names; their first and last names kept changing, but the middle names remained constant. (18 words)

David: teenage dreams:#54 (10/27/96)I was driving my car late at night with Laura. Suddenly I saw an airplane, and noticed that it was dropping a bomb nearby. I began to drive very quickly, frantically telling Laura, who hadn't seen it. I was wondering what it would feel like, would we die instantly, would we be crushed, would our car roll over many times, etc. And while I was imagining all these terrible ways of dying, my instincts were pressing me to drive as far from the place I saw the bomb fall as possible. 

Still, at the same time, a part of me was saying: well, this is it. We're going to die. It's finally come down to it. No escape. It just doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all. (127 words)

David: teenage dreams:#55 (10/28/96)All I remember is a skinhead telling me, "pour le petit dijeuner, j'ai cafi noire et des cigarettes." (For breakfast, I have black coffee and cigarettes.) (26 words)

David: teenage dreams:#56 (10/31/96)I recall a stack of old Dr. Suess books. Great fun. I thought of finding the Lorax and giving it to Laura. (22 words)

David: teenage dreams:#57 (10/31/96)I was fencing with somebody that resembled Jimmy. Only, he had a sword and I didn't. So I pretended to have a sword, which worked pretty well until he noticed. Then a sword appeared in my hand and we really began to fight. We fought for a long time. We were both really getting into it. Finally, he had me at his mercy and we stopped fighting. I thought to myself that sport is the most sublime meditation avaliable to the average individual, to be completely in tune with a healthy body. I thought how much better this was than the time I almost drowned, in shallow water no less. (110 words)

David: teenage dreams:#58 (11/01/96)I was going to the High School, which was located at the junior college. So I get on a skateboard (apparently my only means of transportation) and skateboard to school. I get there in the evening -- there is some kind of athletic event going on. It is fall, and nobody is around, so I skate all the way up to the light on College Drive and "park" my skateboard. I actually parallel park it. Then I step off and think to myself: Anybody could steal it that way! So I put it in my pocket and go down to the track event. I watch a pretty girl running around with the other runners. Apparently this is my girlfriend, and I came down to see her run. Something happens, and I see her being lifted onto people's shoulders. She must have won, I think before waking up. (147 words)

David: teenage dreams:#59 (11/02/96)I was taking a boat to or from India, I don't know which. I need to get my things from my hotel room. Nobody will let me. Finally I sneak past a "stewardess" and look back later to see that she's turned into an elephant. (45 words)

David: teenage dreams:#60 (11/05/96)I remember driving on a country road in winter. We're in the Rockies and it's very dangerous. I almost get hit a few times. I park my car and walk for about four miles until I get to the place where the "concert" is supposed to be. It's this huge snowy field. I go out into the middle and look for Laura. No Laura. Eventually a wall grows up around the sides and the people begin to chant the performer's name. I realize that Rhonda is with me now. She changes into Laura and then Laura changes back into Rhonda. She keeps oscillating this way as they chant. By now there's literally millions of people in the auditorium, and I'm up near the front. Then the announcement: no performance. The people immediately stop chanting and crush out the door. We get trampled. 

Next thing I know, it's morning, and Laura/Rhonda and I are the last ones out the door. We collapse on the ground next to each other, in the snow. There we lay. I have my hand on her thigh and rub it unconsciously. Then I open my eyes and look over, to find that it's neither Laura nor Rhonda but this really tall blonde girl from the junior college. She laughs at me. "I though you said you could tell women apart by the feel of their thighs," she taunts me. "No, I didn't," I reply, and stand up to trek back to the car. The four mile trek was cut out. So was the drive.

Then I'm at the college, talking to people. I talk to Laura about philosophy. She goes to class and I grab a random person. "Wanna go to coffee?" I ask. He -- a big fat guy -- agrees, and we drive downtown to a parking lot where I have to pay 3 cents for parking for the coffee house, 4 cents for the bagel place, and 2 cents for something else, which everybody is at. I go inside the Coffee House and order a coffee at the counter. While she gets my coffee I speak to of the book of Job. The story interests me with its many layers of meaning. My coffee comes, and I order a scone which is sitting right next to me. She tells me it isn't a real scone, but if I'll get her a danish from one of the tables (danishes and muffins are like salt and pepper shakers here: one for each table) she'll get me a scone. So I retrieve a jelly (strawberry) danish for her. She gives me a scone and tells me that "Gary" does that kind of thing all the time. I have no idea what this meant. (457 words)

David: teenage dreams:#61 (11/11/96)One quite vivid image from last night's dream is my own stocky torso and legs with my head totally blown off, blood everywhere. Laura not wanting to see the corpse but ending up holding my hand. Had to identify me, you see. (42 words)

David: teenage dreams:#62 (02/14/97)I was walking through an alleyway, and this guy asks for change. I looked at him, decided he could use some cash and gave him a buck. 

"Thanks," he said. "But what I really wanted, was to show you this funky wall."

He points to my right. Sure enough, it is a pretty funky wall: all bricks, red. Certain door shaped portions stand out from the rest of the wall, with huge leather straps running across them. The bum goes and knocks on one of them.

"Watch," he commands me. Soon, a tall, portly black man with a face like the Mayor's opens the door in a red smoking jacket. He is wearing red silk pyjamas underneath as well; you can see the fabric from his kees down to his feet.

"What the hell you want from me?" he asks the bum. "I don't have no gold pieces in here. No gold pieces. What you want? I told you I don't have no gold pieces in here!"

He shakes his head and slams the door in our face, Q.E.D.

Meantime, Jimmy comes out of a door somewhat to my right. Passing me, he thumbs over his shoulder:

"My sister's right in there."

I go into the hallway, follow it to the end, and see Lisa lying there on the bed, nude, back arched. I walk to the foot of the bed. "I find you very attractive," I say, very matter-of-factly. I put my hand between her legs. "Mind if I express that?" I ask in a scholar's tone. We make love. (261 words)

David: teenage dreams:#63 (03/03/97)I'm walking around. On a sunny, sunny street in Puerto Vallarta. I was standing up against some kind of railing over a Marine-world type pool with lots of clouds floating around in it. Lots of Mario Bros Three type clouds. There was this really neat airplane flying around in the air at high speed and altitudes. It was doing all kinds of crazy loops and spins everywhere. So I ducked into the junior college library (!) and looked at the periodicals. Why these two events are related I don't know. I walked up to the counter and loudly demanded that they provide me with the latest issue of "Playboy". "I am sorry sir. We do not carry Playboy," says the really attractive redheaded librarian that I continually drool over whenever I go in. I am very embarrassed and I sneak out of a hole in the wall. 

Suddenly I'm back, leaning on the railing over the pool. This airplane, which is a World War II-style bomber, starts doing really, really wide angle turns. A giant metal rod zooms out from the motor. A rocket is attached to the end of this rod. As far as I can tell, this is some kind of device to keep it in the air as it does these insane turns.

"Yes!" says the disembodied voice. "It is a stabilizing device!" Suddenly I reflect that nobody is using contractions, and for some reason this creeps me out.

While this stabilizing device is in motion, a man gets out of the airplane (seemingly by sneaking out of a hole in the fuselage) and climbs up on top of the top wing of the biplane. He grabs onto the wing, and stomps on the plane with both feet. Immediately, the plane's motor stops, and both plane and man fall into the pool, making a resounding crash. This crash makes all the Mario Brothers clouds shatter and fall into the water.

The man walks up to me, and soberly informs me: "I have landed my biplane. Follow me."

I follow him as he walks. We pass his "office". I look inside and see a woman, in her thirties or forties, posing for the camera in nothing but panties and a bra. I should clairfy: in nothing but Victoria's Secret-style lacy lingerie. The woman behind the camera sees me looking, warns the woman posing, and, *poof*! She's immediately fully dressed!

The man waves his hand towards a second pool. "This program has been sponsored by Coca-Cola," he says. I look where he points, into the other pool, and I see a pool filled with about five billion cans of coke on ice. The voice of Carl Sagan comes into my head, saying "billions and billions..." I woke myself up with laughing. (462 words)

David: teenage dreams:#64 (05/04/97)This morning I had a dream about Gwen. I was holding in my hand the original draft of my novel, and I was telling her: "See this? I wrote this because of you. This book is about you. You brought this story into my life, and I told it." Then our friend Sarah came along and disappeared. Gwen implored me to come and find Sarah, to get Sarah. (68 words)

David: teenage dreams:#65 (07/08/97)The area by the beach was condemned as a whole, quarantined and evacuated. People went in and cleaned it up. The town begins to resemble Venice. The Pope is coming to make a tour. Somehow I meet the Pope and take him around downtown, I talk to him but he keeps breaking into Ukranian and Greek. He says he's going to go meet the Ali Baba Kiosk guy, "Jimmy", over in the entrance to the city (a long green-walled channel sixteen feet deep) because it reminds him of his "native Macedonia". The Pope has made a four CD set wherein he comments on and talks about our town. In a variety of languages, of course. I, his new friend, am to walk around the newly refurbished beach area selling the CD. All the houses were sparkling blue and white. There was a dance hall by the entrance to the city; Perry's Coffee Shop moved into it because its old building was condemned. We were listening to Middle Eastern music. On the Pope's orders nobody could drink caffeine. Naturally, everybody in Perry's was pissed! So I went down into the beach -- I was smuggling caffeineated coke in. And the way I got it in was by putting it in these huge berry gatorade jars. This is how I met the Pope -- he saw me bringing the "non-caffeinated" drinks into the "ghettoes" (now the best part of town) and decided I was his friend. Before the pope left to meet "Jimmy", he told me I couldn't come, because they would be talking about "highly secret things." But wait -- I didn't speak a word of colloquial Albanian, did I? So I could come along if I liked. It occurred to me that I should run over to the library and learn Albanian real quick so I could hear all the Pope's secret discussions. (313 words)

David: teenage dreams:#66 (07/17/97)I dreamt that Jimmy, Laura, my mother-in-law and I were all going on a camping trip, like the Pinnacles trip I just took with them. Only Jimmy had an orange Volkswagen bus (like my mother-in-law) and he was driving us all. So I packed up. Then, I started reading a biography of somebody. It was just some random person somebody wrote a biography of. It wasn't anybody special, nobody strange, nobody unique or remarkable, or even famous. Just some idiot with a name like John Smith. And they had written this huge fourteen-hundred-plus biography of this totally random person. Yet, it was fascinating. I'd never seen anybody devote so much work to something so completely worthless. The author of this biography said, in the introduction, that he didn't think his book was worth writing. In fact, he thought that it was a total waste of time. The author never justified himself in chronicling every half-second of this guy's life. His source, said the author, was this man's diaries, which he had kept from the age of one day (quite a feat!) until after he died (another feat)! I read it, completely absorbed in the trivialities of this completely trivial person's day to day existence, until I looked up at the clock, and saw that it was four in the morning. 'Shit!' I thought to myself. 'I guess I had better stay up all night.' I began to feel very tired, like I ought to go to sleep, but then I decided against it. I walked around in my kitchen until five or so. Then I went outside and watched the sun rise. Then I woke up. It was around six-thirty, just about when I settled down into 'bed' in my dream to 'go back to sleep'. In my dream, I looked at the clock and said, 'ah! Six thirty. Now I can sleep!' It was so vivid, that when my alarm went off a few minutes later, I actually said 'Shit! Now I'll never get any sleep!' It took a little bit of head-clearing before I realized that I had in fact slept, and that I needed to get up and take a shower. What clued me in was the fact that we weren't going on a camping trip.

David: teenage dreams:#67 (08/09/97)I dreamt that at one point, I had had an older brother named Simon, who died when I was twelve in a motorcycle accident. One of the things that made this dream so wierd was that I had vividly *re-imagined* old family photographs to include this third brother who had never existed. He looked sort of like a cross between myself, Andy and Brent. (64 words)

David: teenage dreams:#68 (08/10/97)I lived on the rooftop of the a building near the beach with Laura. It smelled really bad, just like the waterfront, like piss and saltwater and dead fish. Nonetheless, it was really expensive. To get in, we had to climb this ladder up the side of the building that was made of fresh, untreated pine boards. Each had the legend DO NOT INVENTORY painted on it in green block letters. Laura and I were going to move because it was too expensive. So we were trying to use the phone to get in touch with Jimmy and Kelly, for some reason. But the phone wouldn't work! I climbed down the ladder, found a payphone, and dialed PacBell. I chewed them out: we haven't left yet! Damn you! Now they can call in but we can't call out! Damn it! ARRRGH!! BLAH BLAH BLAH I hung up the phone angrily and looked around. I was in front of some kind of 'Hotel'. But the entryway was kind of a dock. People would sail up, get off their boats, and their boats would be sailed off by valets. I rushed back up the ladder. Some kind of calamity had transpired. All these people were in the apartment, including some firemen, some police, a few young boys, and their father. I was talking to one who was about twelve, and he was complaining that he didn't have anything to read. His father produces a huge tome and drops it on his son's head: "read this," he advised. (255 words)

David: teenage dreams:#69 (09/24/97)We were back in my parents' house: me, Laura, and one of her friends. We were hanging out in my old room; we had brought some stuff in and were preparing to clean it and some other things out. One of these things was a black backpack with a book on 'Black Magic' in it. Inside this book -- rather, on top of it, between the covers -- was a huge mass of yellowish-brown chunky material. I knew this to be 'human remains', and it was somehow associated with the Ku Klux Klan and racist politicians. It was something I had found in the house. 

We all had to take showers before we left because we were all dirty. Laura took hers, and I took mine. I came back into my old room, naked, and saw that Laura's friend was about to touch the 'human remains'. I told her not to do that, and let me tell her the story. And by the way, the shower was free. So I lead her over to my parents' shower and I begin to tell her the story about the human remains, but then I notice that my parents have come back home and are in their bed (which is right by the door to their bedroom). In fact, my mother has sat up and is glaring at me. I realize I'm naked, and immediately I jump into the bathroom and begin looking for a towel to wrap around myself, but they're all too small. After finding two smaller towels, I discover a big one that will wrap around me. I exit the bathroom thus covered, and find that my parents -- rather, my mother -- is about the house causing a ruckus, moaning and crying because Laura and I call elsewhere "home". "Let's go home," I say to Laura. She says: "Wait. I have to train these vines first."

In my old room there is a huge box with these foot long, caterpillar-like things in them. These are the vines. Laura has twisted each one with another, sometimes a smaller one, sometimes not. These are writhing and turning like animals, and swimming around on the surface of the box like bacteria under a microscope. They are bulging out at the ends.

"Look," I say. "They're trying to sprout. Shouldn't you put them in water?"

"Naah," says Laura. "They'll live."

"We should pack up the rest of this stuff," I said.

"Why is there so much, anyway?"

"Remember?" I say. "We thought they'd be coming back tomorrow. We had an extra day."

I start going through the box in the closet. I dispose of the 'human remains' out the window, take the perfectly clean book entitled "Black Magic", I take a few other books, and leave in the closet a few adolescent romance novels. None of the stuff in the box was mine. (480 words)

David: teenage dreams:#70 (10/27/97)I'm downtown, on C. street, standing on the sidewalk. Across the way is the used book store; the parking lot is behind me. Laura walks up with an old friend of hers, Katy. They talk for a while. Earl and Hannah talk for a while. Suddenly I realize that I'm very wet. I'm dripping with water. So I bid my friends farewell and walk down the street. 

All of C street and what used to be the bookstore's parking lot is a huge market. I'm actually on C Street, and all that is being sold on this street are tortillas. Piles and piles of them. Everywhere on the ground are big piles of tortillas with Mexican vendors offering them. The strange thing about this street is that I seem to be the only consumer in the entire tortilla market, and nobody is offering me any. I come to the end of the street and see what looks like a huge, black composting bin. Opposite sides of this bocks have these circular apertures with plastic flaps, like recycling bins. Except it's big enough for a person to go into. Curiously, I inspect the label.

"Drying Machine."

Underneath this was a description of how it worked. It massaged your entire body with towels until it was dry. Then it spit you out the other end. You had to take off your clothes, though, and either rent a locker for them, or just leave them on the sidewalk and hope nobody stole them. If you had a wetsuit, you could leave it on. (!) I noticed a bunch of ads underneath:

"Surfers can't get enough of it! Jews love it! Wet people need it! Try THE DRYING MACHINE (tm) TODAY!!!!!!" I didn't want to leave my clothes on the sidewalk, so I didn't try it. ("Jews love it!"???) (305 words)

David: teenage dreams:#71 (10/27/97)Jimmy is seeing an older woman, fortyish. She has an absolutely *stupendous* body. She sits on the futon for a while as Laura and I talk. The woman is rather domineering. Laura and I were removing plants from the side of the road I used to live on in Green City. Laura was wearing a nearly completely transparent shirt. (59 words)

David: teenage dreams:#72 (12/02/97)I was laying on a bed, staring up at the ceiling. An old, withered voice says: "This is a most exquisite statue of Our Savior, most exquisite indeeEed." 

I sit up and see a very realistic statue of Jesus sitting there in the middle of the room. The voice came from this thin old man with a gray goatee and he's dressed up like the Pope, so I assume he's the pope. The guy actually came from a BBC production of King John, where he played the meddling bishop. I have a computer next to me, and I'm sending email to my friend Dylan. Meanwhile the Pope just begins ranting. I stand up from the bed and turn to see what the Pope is looking at. By golly, it's Thomas Merton. He's dressed up in gardening clothes and looks very jolly, but he seems a trifle hurt by the Pope's words, whatever they were. With very dirty hands, he spreads a variety of squashes, zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, etc. "From my garden," he explains. He's wearing a straw hat and overalls. (180 words)

David: teenage dreams:#73 (01/07/98)Will and Bryan are telling us in horrid and grotesque detail of a riot they witnessed. Will in particular tells me about a body he saw which was slashed from the tailbone to the base of his neck. He tells me about it and I visualize it in all its bloody hideousness. It is so revolting I wake the hell up. (61 words)

David: teenage dreams:#74 (01/08/98)A party. At somebody's expensive looking house. It is connected in some way with poetry. Jennifer is there, making the party go round. I realize somehow, when everyone has gone home, that Laura is asleep in the next room. The heating element on the stove, the coil part, begins to burn like a fuse, and I know that if I let it burn to the center ("the transistor", I call it in my dream) it will explode and kill us. I try to drag Laura out of the house, frantically pulling and shouting at her to wake up. I wake up, instead. (102 words)

David: teenage dreams:#75 (01/09/98)I was standing before three large spaghetti sauce jars, all of which seemed crusty and old. Just as well, because two of them contained spiders. The jars were stacked vertically. The middle one had the most spiders -- seven or eight little brown things with mre or less spherical abdomens. The jar was also filled with little green strings. Each of these strings had a ball at the end. They had emanated from the spiders somehow. The lower jar had only two or three spiders in it, and these were more common-looking: largish legs, small, flat bodies. All of a sudden I notice I'm holding a book. I look down and open it to the proper page. I read: "The spiders in the middle jar are offensive little things. They're not good for anything, and they emanate a little green thread that many people wonder at. Do not be decieved! These little green threads are solid farts! Many times in my presence small unruly children have lit them on fire for a joke. I much prefer the spiders in the lower jar. They are not so offensive and, what's more, they make great tahini sauce!" Repulsed by the idea of making anything to eat out of a spider, I shut the book. (212 words)

David: teenage dreams:#76 (01/11/98)The doorbell rang (!) and I looked outside on the steps. There was a package there. "Ooo!" I think. "My Stephen Hawking book!" I pick the package up and bring it inside to the kitchen. I remember some aria from Il Trovatore was playing. Laura's working next to me in the kitchen. I open the package: inside are four stacks of County Transit bus schedules. Along with three maps: one of a nearby city, one of San Francisco, and a geological/topographical map of the world. "Odd," I said. "I only sent away for one schedule." (95 words)

David: teenage dreams:#77 (01/15/98)I was walking through a "Museum of Human Anatomy" with a number of other people. We come soon to the skull display. There is one skull in full light, and another one beside it, indirectly lit, so it is mainly in the darkness. This skull has skin stretched over it, dead, straw-like hair, and eyeballs. The lips seem to be cut off. It doesn't look like he died a very pleasant death. Most of this is pretty well hidden by the obscure lighting, however. So we're walking along, and this idiot hippie guy bumps into the case, knocking the hideous head out into the full light. Everybody is very disgusted and turns away. The hippie guy says: "Whoa... sick." It wakes me up. (123 words)

David: teenage dreams:#78 (01/15/98)I'm in Patrick's "hovel". Patrick has built a bizzare little house for himself among the roots of a huge oak tree. It's one main room and a couple of side rooms. Patrick has died, and in his will he left me my old Apple II+! I turn the computer on and begin poking with the files "on it", as if it had a hard drive. (65 words)

David: teenage dreams:#79 (01/15/98)My family is staying in this really fancy hotel in the middle of a huge city. They offered to let me stay there for free, so of course I agreed to come along. I can't remember much of the "plot", such as it was, but I remember a few details: The main stairwell was blocked at both ends by this wierd fence thing, presumably to keep infants off the stairs. It was beyond me, though, so it succeeded in keeping me off the stairs as well until somebody showed me how to climb under it. As I got up the stairs, though, I found my way blocked by a net thing that folded over three steps. I picked it up and played with it a bit. Suddenly I noticed the crown at my feet. Of course! It's a tiara! The best way to get from room to room (if you were sure of your footing) was by climbing from porch to porch. Once I climbed into the wrong people's room and created much havoc. I was in my room at one point, thinking of taking a shower. I got a phone call from some woman. "Hi David," she says, and goes on talking like she knows me real well. I have no idea who it is. "Tell ya what," I say. "How about I meet you in the lobby down there in half an hour? I'll be reading a book." 

"Okay," she says.

I then see that the room I'm in has no shower. We say goodbye and hang up. I walk down to the lobby and accost somebody. "I need to take a shower!" I say. He points me down the street, a huge, busy city street, to where the showers are. I thank him and skip off to take my shower. (303 words)

David: teenage dreams:#80 (01/20/98)We had the corpses of Saul Bellow and "Nathan Zuckerman" (Philip Roth) in caskets in our apartment. They were dead and we were to bury them the following day. Roth had a cheap casket, made of paperboard, and Bellow had a fine ebony one. I was to deliver the eulogies. Laura and I decided to put them outside because they were beginning to stink. Only problem was, it was raining. We stacked them on the porch, Bellow (who was tall) on the bottom and Roth (who'd been short) on the top, and covered them with a blue blanket to protect them from rain. The subjects of the eulogies were to be "Seize the Day" and "The Ghost Writer". I was rereading both of them late at night to think of something to say. We were laying in bed. This is when Laura noticed the corpses were stinking. We then moved Bellow off the kitchen table with his dark black wooden casket and Roth with his blue paperboard ex-musical instrument case (with metal reinforced corners) off the stool, and moved them out. Then we laid our own blankets back out. I thought I spied a spider in the blankets, but on inspection, it turned out to be some orange lint. I menioned to Laura: "Roth must have been really fucking cheap. I'll bet he wouldn't pay a dollar fifty for coffee." There was something earlier involving buses, but I no longer recall. (241 words)

David: teenage dreams:#81 (01/21/98)Laura, Jimmy and I were in Germany. Jimmy and I were in a bookstore which was underground. All the people spoke in these wierd voices that sounded amplified, tinny, and distorted. Naturally they were saying things in German. I remember one large man saying to another: "Bitte! Ich moechte mich unterhalten!" (Please! I'd like to enjoy myself!) At one point Laura came flying down the stairs with three ostriches. She was riding one of them. "I got these for twelve bucks!" she said. "No, you didn't!" Jimmy corrected her, examining the price tags. "You paid twelve pounds each! That's like 90 dollars!" We all got on the ostriches and blasted down the stairs through the bookstore, startling all the Bavarians. Suddenly we were in a river, an underground river. At one point I recall floating a fat person around on the water. We eventually got washed to Vienna. So now we're in a hotel in Vienna. A fat man and his wife, the same fat man we'd been floating in the river, tells us they're looking for their daughter, and shows us a picture of her. (186 words)

David: teenage dreams:#82 (01/24/98)I was getting on a bus at the Green City Denny's. This was a bus that drove up Green Drive, turned around, and drove back. Tim was on the bus. I hated him for years because I believed he stole my girlfriend, and all that hate came back in this dream. (51 words)

David: teenage dreams:#83 (01/25/98)I was naked. So was Laura. I was re-stringing an unvarnished electric bass, so I guess it was naked, too. At one point I put a screw in to secure a string, but then realized I wasn't holding the bass but Laura, and I had attempted to affix the string to her cunt. She seemed to like it, though, so I kept turning the screw. (65 words)

David: teenage dreams:#84 (01/31/98)I am a Chinese man, and I'm going to marry a wealthy man's daughter. This makes me the inheritor of this man's fortune. In order to claim my right both to the daughter and the fortune, however, I must kill her younger brother. He's now jealous because the fortune would have gone to him. So I end by shooting him through the head with crossbow bolts, literally pinning him to the wall. (72 words)

David: teenage dreams:#85 (02/01/98)First of all, I'm in a bookstore, and I see that Tim Eagan has brought out a new collection of Subconscious Stuff. Or so it seems. I look again and see that it's actually a four-volume set -- two diaries, a sketchbook, and a little book of his philosophy. Since I like his comics I buy these books. We're going to a brunch with my family. I need to use the bathroom, so I tell my parents this, and I use their bathroom to take a crap. I read the first entry -- it's a very serious entry all about a 'new direction' in his life. However, he ends the entry with: "Oh well. I'm not as excited as when I first brought these notebooks into the can." The books are hardbound, but they're printed on newsprint. At the beginning is a "picture of Tim Eagan". He looks like an evangelist. A fat laughing guy in a tacky dark-colored suit is next to him in the photo. In the sketchbook, in the very beginning, there is a strange drawing entitled 'me'. This, I supposed, was his cartoon self-portrait. While I'm cleaning up, I hear my mother complaining to my father: "I wish you'd throw them away. I just don't like it when Nick has access to all these pictures of naked women! You never did outgrow dirty pictures..." Sarcastically I mutter something about mothers and I leave the bathroom. I ask if everyone's ready. "David," he says. "the brunch isn't until 1:30 or so." "Wow," says I. "that's a long time." I go into the living room. My dad follows. On the machine are several angry phone calls from Sonja. She calls again and I hear my dad's side of the conversation. She's coming soon, I gather. Eventually she arrives. She looks haggard and disheveled. "I haven't slept for 25 hours," she says. 

We go have brunch. It's some kind of big to-do. Tim Eagan is there. I recognize him by his self-portrait. The photo was completely wrong. I tell him I liked his new books. He thanks me. I give a little speech and sing a song, with a music stand for a podium. Everybody compliments me on these -- but everyone seems to feel a need to denigrate the music stand. "Sigh," I think. "It's always something." One such person was a thirtyish, long-haired type. Almost everyone I recognize in town was at this thing -- Jeff G., people from cafes. I go outside for some fresh air, and immediately run into a couple of "professional bums". " 'Ello, Guv'ner!" one says in his cockney. I recognize them and greet them by name, but I can't remember what I called them. I dug in my pockets and gave them all but my quarters -- all my change but those twelve cents. One of them calls my father a 'skinflint'. This last part's unclear. I've gotten a bus pass, an 'All' bus pass, orange, with a big 'A' on it. It's good anywhere, anytime, for any ride, "except route 40". I'm climbing around on some rocks outside the building the 'brunch' was in (incidentally, it's dark as night out), and I'm trying not to smash a big grey spider named 'Max'. (542 words)

David: teenage dreams:#86 (02/05/98)I'm in the desert, having a conversation with a couple of German people. The conversation is moving along smoothly, until I can't remember the word for 'battery'. "Ist es 'batt-err-ee'?" I ask. I get laughter. I hem and haw for a while. "Ich weiss dass!" I turn to one of them. "Wie sagt man "battery" auf Deutsch?" 

One of them, a young exchange student looking type, smiles and says: "Wir werden Sie drei Tagen verlassen. Wenn Sie sich erinnern nicht, wir sagen werden." (We'll give you three days. If you can't remember then, we'll tell you." And they disappear, leaving me to trek back through the desert to my 'home'. They drive off in a jeep.

By the time I get home, it is nighttime, and something has happened to the rest of humanity. Laura shows me a large circular map. "My mother just went out there and mapped the whole city. She didn't find anyone. They're all gone."

Indeed, I look at the map and see rows of individual houses, each marked with a little 'e' for 'empty'. "She checked all those places?" I ask.

"Well, it's like the Census," Laura said. "She checked a certain number and then extrapolated the data." Laura plays with a protractor and compass on the map for a while. She talks again: "At any rate, everyone's gone, whatever it means."

"If there's a God," I joke, "he probably wiped out the rest of humanity because they suck, and He wanted to start over from us. Like Noah."

Laura laughs. "But doesn't it say, in the Bible, that God said he wouldn't do that again, ever?"

"Laura, I was joking. It's a myth. Whatever happened, they probably just missed us."

Laura looks out the door. "Oh man," she laments. "Here comes another one! Can I have a pair of scissors, something sharp?"

I hand her the nearest pair. "This one has a little glue on it. Is that okay? Can you use it?"

"I'd rather not." She really doesn't want to. "It might get stuck, and then it wouldn't deflate."

"What wouldn't?"

"Oh, these damn inflatable babies!"

I grab a pitchfork and walk to the door. Sure enough, a malicious looking plastic inflatable baby, with little drawn on dots for eyes, is crawling towards the door. I should add that it was about six feet long and two or three feet high at the shoulder. It obviously means harm. "When you stab it," Laura advises, "try to leave the pitchfork in while still letting out the air. Otherwise they blow all over the place like a balloon." I stab the baby several times as it enters the house. As the baby deflates, it turns into a shrivelled-up, forlorn-looking plastic garbage bag. "How many of these have you killed?" I ask.

"Oh, two or three."

We walk outside. It's still nighttime out and there's a wierd glow to everything. I hear a voice and direct my attention to it. After a while we discover the source. The tall, blonde library page whose legs I once dreamt about feeling is sitting on top of some huge twenty gallon drums, nude, and some nondescript man is industriously making love to her. She keeps making cute little noises and thanking him.

I point to them and turn to Laura. "Under these circumstances, probably the best idea," I say. Then, after a short pause: "It's 'die Batterie', I'm sure of it. They were just fucking with me."

"David!" Laura says. "Get over it! Does it really matter right now?" I laugh, conceding the point. (595 words)

David: teenage dreams:#87 (02/08/98)So! I'm working at the Hillside Library, with Will. But today, even though it's insanely busy, he's not helping out at all. He's on the phone, talking with his boyfriend Bryan, who currently lives in Boulder or Denver. Right then Will walks out, and I pick up the phone to see what they're talking about. I say "Hello? Hello?" but they completely ignore me: in the background, quietly, they're talking about stocks. Finally one of them addresses me directly, and says: "You know, there's some kind of SubGenius thing going on in town tomorrow..." 

I set down the phone in order to help a patron. This patron begins to talk about a book that he just read, telling me all about it, in the long winded way a patron will sometimes do when there's a thousand people in line. As I listen to him tell the story, I enter into it myself: I see my father standing at the telephone in the kitchen at their house, and he speaks in a voice-over:

"My father, your grandfather, is in his last days. He never called much before. But the last two days he called me at SEVEN in the morning to talk about his grave and burial with me..."

Now I see my grandfather, Bob, smoking a pipe and standing outside a huge grey building. (Yes, my grandfather really IS named Bob, and he really DOES smoke a pipe.) His voice starts in:

His voice sounds like William S. Burroughs. "One day I came to work at the silk factory... Jones is dead!" We see him, shocked at learning the news. "Came in the next day... Wilkinson is dead!" We see him learning the news from a secretary, fear growing. "Next day another one had died; the following day, another!" He's in front of the silk factory again: "I know that I'm next."

The next part is somewhat confused, but somehow, my grandfather has already died and his ghost is now chasing me around the front of the silk factory. He wants to freeze me to death with snow. As I run down a path around the factory, I think the following 'profound' thought: "He's got nothing on me, because if I beat him, I live; if I die, I'm dead." He corners me in a large chicken coop, but somehow, I knew we had 'agreed' to meet there in some secret way. But there's already somebody there: a tall, thin, dark-haired woman in a skimpy, red, white and blue one-piece swimsuit. This woman I recognize as one of the models in a stretching book Laura and I had been using through January. She's going to help me against my grandfather's ghost. Grandfather Bob very tersely says to her: "Get out of the coop. Now." And snow begins to blizzard around him.

At this point the story dissolves and I'm back in the library again, talking to the patron. I tell him: "Thanks anyway, but I hate fiction like that." Will, in the meantime, has come back from his break. He tells me: "Hey! I won a million dollars on the stock market!" He hands me the phone. Bryan is repeating in a monotone voice: ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILL... ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILL...

I tell Will, "God, Will, it's busy today. Can't you help out a little instead of talking to Bryan?" As I wake up I think that if the ghost killed me that I at least knew there was an afterlife because a ghost killed me. (589 words)

David: teenage dreams:#88 (02/17/98)I'm standing in a church. Dozens of clones of Matt (a friend) are being gunned down in cold blood by machine gun fire. I hide under a pew when the gunfire starts. I see the clones' heads being blown off, etc. Somehow I knew that the situation outside was really crappy, and that even if I did make it out alive, living would be a highly questionable alternative to dying. Whatever the situation was, it was probably better to be dead than to be crawling around half-dead, running for my life. Besides, I figured, there were two other things about dying: First of all, if I got myself killed just then, and death turned out to be nothing, then great. At least I wouldn't be in agony; at least the torturers couldn't get me too. Second, if death turned out any other way, than equally great, because then I'd be out of this crappy situation and in some other state of affairs. On this thought, I stood up and had my body ripped through by machine-gun fire. After I died, I found myself in a room with two beautiful, naked women, one brunette, one blonde. And Matt. I have sex with the blonde woman for a while, and then we stop to invite the brunette. She can't. She points over at a hallway. She explains that she needs to go get her womb, or her ovaries, or her 'placenta' -- I remember it was some part of the reproductive system, or the placenta; I don't know whether this latter was supposed to be her own or her baby's -- but every time she goes into the hallway, Matt shoots her to death and she has to start all over again. So she never goes to get 'it', and she never joins me and the blonde. (305 words)

David: teenage dreams:#89 (02/20/98)It happened like this. Laura and I were walking through an old, deserted street -- at least, I thought it was a street. There were rows of concrete stairs going up to wooden doors with white paint flaking off of them, as though they hadn't been repainted for years. I look around on the ground and see that it is completely covered with rotting vegetation -- old dead leaves, mushrooms, dirt, etc... forest debris, in other words. This old street had been deserted and nature was taking over. 

"Neat road," I say. "Not a road," says Laura. "An ancient mansion." She points up, and I look. Sure enough, there was the framework of a long-since rotted out roof up there. So we were in an entrance hall. We both have to use the bathroom. So we go into a door Laura knows and find a toilet. A little man is waiting in the bathroom. Laura can use the regular toilet, he explains, and since I have to go so bad, there's a special toilet that I can use right -- here! He opens a small panel near the bottom of the wall. The way it works is, I climb into this small chamber, and squat with one leg out, leaning my back against the framework. This way I can piss and shit at the same time with no mess. The man then begins to talk to me about Balzac. As I leave the bathroom, I hear a narrator say that this was the ancestral home of Aureliano Buendia (from One Hundred Years of Solitude) where he and his friends partied all night in "all the lustiness of youth". (278 words)

David: teenage dreams:#90 (02/21/98)I am sitting at a 4-partition desk like they have got at the junior college library, intended for studying. I'm sitting in front of a large window of some sort, at this desk, 'working on my style'. Laura and I have dinner there and she leaves. I get frustrated with the stupid blue desk lamp -- it keeps flickering on and off -- and so I throw it out the window. I turn on the computer and hook it up to the window (which I'm using as a movie screen) to watch an animated movie, which is done all in blue tints. I put the movie in because the box said it was "Heartwarming". But -- a hick cop on the street shines his light in. Apparently I'm violating some sort of law by watching a blue film. I must stop. Not wanting to stop, I simply pull the shades. Now on the screen I get a Windows error box. It says: "Stop. 3 Minutes." I stop the movie and wait. Another message: "Revert To Wood. Now." Everything goes black. I wake, inexplicably scared. (184 words)

David: teenage dreams:#91 (02/23/98)Crazy dream. To begin with, I'm working in the apartment. It's filthy and disgusting, and Carol from the library is helping me to clean it. I inspect the carpet and see that it's more dirt than carpet: the dirt is so thick that oxalis is flourishing, blooming like crazy, right in the middle of the room. Laura comes home, and she helps in the cleaning too. After a while we get hungry and want to leave for a restaurant. But Jimmy and I are laying on the floor talking! We're discussing 'principles'. I told him that ignoring principles altogether will soon bring him misery enough. I had just read this, in waking life, in a book by Bertrand Russell. What I thought Russell meant was that abstract ethical principles are derived from concrete experience: it has been shown that if you kill somebody his brother will be very angry with you and his brother will try to kill you. Today the surrogate big brother, the judicial system, will get its revenge. Thus you should follow the principle of not killing other people. Less extreme, if you eat too much cake, you'll get sick. You are ignoring the principle of moderation in eating. I was trying to get this across, but naturally, failed, because I had just read it and the meaning had not quite sunk in. What interrupted our conversation was a middle-aged asshole reading a Bill Cosby book. He shook his head very disapprovingly and disagrees with everything we say, it seems, on principle. Laura knows him; she hates him. She cleaned his house once: he performed medical experiments on humans. Apparently the guy was trying to say Well I ignore principles and I'm perfectly happy so nyeah! Heh. 

Now Laura and I are in a highschool classroom. We hide in a nook around the corner of the room and make out. We've stepped into a diorama of the bay on the floor. Nearby is an aquarium filled with all kinds of wierd animals, including a strange turtle, tiny, with all kinds of squarish spikes jutting out from its shell. The "aquarium" I referred to was a lot like the tidepool exhibits in the Aquarium. The owner of the diorama appears and points out the turtles. "They don't look like much, but they sure wreaked havoc on this part here--" he points down at a corner of the diorama-- "only you can't see it, because Bill fixed it too quick for me to show you properly..."

Now we're in the restaurant. Laura goes inside to get a table. Abruptly I decide I don't want to eat at a restaurant, and so I start walking home. I hitchhike: a blonde college girl gives me a ride. I thank her and get out of the car at the base of a wooden footbridge. In the background, Einsturzende Neubauten is playing. I begin to walk across the bridge and pass a skater kid. "Bitte," I say. "I mean, excuse me." The kid scowls, not appreciating my 'slip' into German. Laura meets me on the other side of the bridge. I tell her I was going to call her when I got home. We walk back across. On the other side I say "I got a ride from her--", pointing at the blonde girl, who is sitting on the lap of another girl. This girl is squeezing the blonde girl's breasts. There is a large plastic bag filled with the bagel place's Tomato Herb Bagels at her feet.

Then Laura and I walk into a hospital. We're getting flu shots. I answer a couple questions and they shove a hypo between my fingers: no pain. I joke with the very unimpressed, fat nurse that "I hate that 'full vein' feeling." Next to me is a black Caribbean man, twitching and looking generally ill. He recieves his shot and twitches away. Jimmy (who's suddenly with us again) asks the nurse something, and she begins to explain how Alex got his stomach lining surgically removed. Before she can finish, however, she is interrupted to serve up some peach pie to us patients. She uses the hypo syringe to do this. I thought to myself: "Gee, I hope she sterilized that before using it." The thought of that needle having been unsterilized (especially since it had been in the hand of that *very* infected-looking man) nearly makes me stop eating the pie, but then I figure, Hey, it's a hospital. *Everything* gets sterilized here. I wake. (750 words)

David: teenage dreams:#92 (03/11/98)I dreamt that I was standing outside a cafe when Jeff tapped me on the shoulder. "Oh, hello!" I said. "How've you been?" He responds in a typical fashion, sort of nervously, looking around at everything but me, squinting into the distance, looking obliquely at me to check my reactions, alluding to private events as though they were common knowledge. Sharp guy, but annoying to talk to. "Oh, I just moved in here, you know. Mary and I, we got back together." 

"I didn't know you were back together."

"Yeah, well. That was a pretty big thing, you know..." It turns out we're now living in the same house. I have the upstairs apartment. We open a trapdoor and find a wierd plastic sheet with lots of white plastic spiders on it. There's a few real ones; Jeff flicks those off, saying: "Oh, these are the fake spiders. You don't want the real ones there, you know." He helps me through the trapdoor into the attic room. (167 words)

David: teenage dreams:#93 (03/11/98)I was walking down one aisle of the metro station, in an entourage containing all my friends. We are, at the moment, Very Unhappy -- everybody is quite depressed, and Andy is weeping furiously. Mr. Burns, the friendly deaf old geezer who comes into the Hillside library all the time is guiding people to the funeral. He hits me in a friendly way with his rolled up newspaper in order to get me on the right track: you see, I'm leading the procession. Soon we came to the funeral. It's in the parking lot next to the bus station. This is Melanie's funeral. There is a huge Days of the Dead-style altar erected in the middle of the lot, complete with an enormous black and white photo of Melanie, with flowers ringing all around it and lots of burning candles and papier-mache skeletons and so on. A mariachi dirge is playing in the background. (154 words)

David: teenage dreams:#94 (03/14/98)I dream I'm watching an Australian film named: "The Death That Taught The Citie". Yes, it was spelled that way; "Citie" was "City". I guess that was supposed to be the Australian spelling. Anyway, the movie was about a backwater in the Australian wilderness, about two groups -- an aboriginal tribe and a white tribe. The whole story revolved around this one boy of twelve or thirteen, who had committed some horrible transgression against the (white) tribal law (it was a white boy), and was therefore being made to shoot himself in the face. The aboriginies highly disapproved -- it was 'uncivilized', according to them. They didn't understand the law. And the movie was all about this debate, and all the politics surrounding this punishment: would he be forced to, or not? In the end, it seems, he did kill himself, as custom demanded, but the message of the film was ambiguous. I found the story very interesting, but I guess that's somewhat self-serving, since I directed the film myself. (170 words)

David: teenage dreams:#95 (03/13/98)Jimmy and I were in a park, arguing over the meaning of the word 'go'. We each thought the other was completely full of shit and spent a lot of time arguing about it -- a good natured battle. (39 words)

David: teenage dreams:#96 (03/16/98)I'm exploring an ancient tomb with a friend. We'll call him Bob. This tomb is supposed to be quite ancient and archaelogically important: these are the bones and the dirt of people talked about in the Bible. It's supposed to be an old tomb, but it really resembles the dried-out dusty area under cellarless houses. In the very center we find a set of steel lockers. These lockers contain ancient books. At this point I have a typical thought: "While I'm down here, I might as well get a book." I open the lockers and riffle through them. Bob looks inside the lockers too, but there's nothing he wants. Then, of all people, a Hillside library patron whom I know walks in. He is an Indian man with some very interesting experiences described in the note below. Alan strides in, and says: "Too bad about the rats mon. With the dead people." I look on the ground and there are all these disgusting little bright red rats. Instead of noses there are long red needles. I think he meant it was too bad because of the important corpses to be found there. Later, I'm in the doctor's office because a very unusual event is occurring. Unusual -- for me, a male. I'm menstruating. To cheer me up, Laura quotes from a book about how much parents suck. (227 words)

David: teenage dreams:#97 (03/23/98)I was in some kind of warehouse, some huge hardware store, preparing for a trip with a lot of other people. I keep seeing all kinds of people from the Middle School, and I get fond farewells from Jasmine and Amanda in particular. I go into my trailer, feeling touched, and I find Jimmy there. He's toying with my computer -- he's added a soundcard and speakers. I try to play a game but the sound effects just slow the computer down so much it's useless. After talking with some of the people who'll be taking the trip with me, I realize I'll need two double-A batteries for the device in my hand. I try different batteries that are laying around; no luck. So I go back into the hardware store. I find a large backroom with lots of batteries. But, I've got to take a leak, so I stand in front of a urinal and decide to piss on the orange wall above the urinal next to me. Halfway through my piss I hear a stall door open and I turn back to the urinal. Bob, who used to work at the Music Center, comes up next to me. "Real cute," he sneers. "People have to clean that up, you know." He turns and leaves the bathroom, muttering 'Pissing on the walls...' I leave the bathroom when I'm done and find him and a few other guys sitting around a table, eating. "Is this where I find the batteries?" One guy points and says: "Over that way, see?" I see, and I go where he points, but on the way I'm distracted by a large table with all kinds of stuff on it. The item which really catches my attention is a huge magnifying glass. I magnify various things on the table and consider buying it, for fun, but then I see it will cost $56.74. I think of a picture I once saw of James Joyce holding a magnifying glass. I set down the glass and wake up. (340 words)

David: teenage dreams:#98 (03/25/98)Fragments. 

I'm sitting at a bus stop with my parents, trying to figure out the schedule. Somehow it has something to do with grammar, and I'm trying to explain word stems, infinitives, gerunds and so on. Finally my bus comes.

Jimmy is playing a video game, except it's real. It involves a skull with a fused jaw but no mouth hole, real eyeballs, and a big hole in the back. When you look inside the hole you see all kinds of putrefaction. Whenever you make it talk a hole opens up in the jaw. Whenever a squeaky sound effect is required, a very deep voice has been dubbed in to say: 'squeak squeak'

We're in the library with Matt M., another employee I saw yesterday. Laura tells me I ought to check out a book for him, that "really funny Mark Twain book". I check out a copy of The Innocents Abroad but when I come back they've gone away. (160 words)

David: teenage dreams:#99 (03/26/98)I'm standing by a large swimming pool. There are dozens of naked young women swimming in it, hanging around the sides, etc. But all are skinny-dipping. It turns out it's not just girls, because this is an experimental school run by a guy that looks like George Carlin. He says he didn't tell them to do anything: he just provided the pool and most of them (not all) just swam without clothes. After a confused part, most of the people are gone, and now I'm hanging around the pool with Andy, Melanie, the mousy blonde girl from Hillside Market, and a few other people. The women and a couple guys are now swimming around au naturel. Something happens regarding the house nearby; at any rate, it's time for people to sleep. Everybody got sleep but me, because while I'm sleeping, this hick guy and his dogs (everyone knows him) comes along and needs a place to stay. But actually this paragraph isn't right: I don't remember why I don't sleep. At the end, everybody is hanging out, discussing this problem in the main room, and I mention to Jimmy the fact I got no sleep. He says something cryptic: "Well, at least you got the *Calypso*!" and raises his eyebrows, looks around conspiratorially, and rubs his hands. Apparently he's referring to the nude girls. I'm not amused. I think, I could have done without the naked girls; I needed sleep. I could have *dreamed* them. I particularly remember having this last thought. Another fragment of this dream I cannot place, besides the hick guy and his dogs, is this: the experimental school got shut down. Naked people were too much for the authorities, it seems. (285 words)

David: teenage dreams:#100 (03/28/98)I'm testing my driving skills in the Buick with Laura at night. To see if I can be a bus driver. I dial 481-TIME to learn about the job. I drive very badly, nearly running into things. I park downtown and put things in my backpack in the car. Laura's with me. She digs through the change purse; she's going to get a treat. We walk around downtown (deserted) in the dark like that; it begins to rain. I show Laura how I wear my flannel over my backpack to protect it from rain. Now I'm in a class of some sort, with Mr. W, or somebody like him. The firebell rings and we all run outside. I pause a few minutes to select the writing tablet with the most paper to bring with me. Outside, the teacher gives a lecture on how to prepare the minimum writing supplies for use in fires and earthquakes. I don't listen to him. I think he's a fucker. Back downtown where I left off with Laura, I put my backpack in the back seat of the Buick as it starts to rain harder, and get in the driver's seat. I pull out onto West street and nearly hit a car in front of me; I swerve and go through the intersection. I can't find the brake fast enough to stop before the intersection at Main, so I glide through, find the brake, and pull the car to a halt at the left turn signal. Laura says: "God, David, you need practice." 

It is still downtown, still night, still raining. Laura is standing outside a building of some sort. It looks like a large rectangular metal vault set on concrete. I think it was supposed to be a bank. Laura might be naked, I'm not sure, but she's definitely shirtless. She has her arms crossed under her breasts, squeezing them up. They look very full and uncomfortable for her. She's waiting for me. All through this I keep thinking of J.B. Priestly. The name and the effect of his book I just read [Man and Time] hang in the background of everything, coloring every action but not changing them. It's hard to describe. I later dreamed of a Monty Python-looking guy in Elizabethan dress who announced that they're taking the POMP out of pompousness, leaving nothing but ousness. (391 words)

David: teenage dreams:#101 (03/29/98)My dad, a big fat Latin American, wants me and Laura to help him slaughter the hog he brought home for Christmas. He leads us out into a hallway with a brand new white carpet and pulls the huge, strangely docile animal out from under a shelf, holding it out. After a brief little argument over what cuts of meat we'll each get, "dad" asks me to please turn the head while he cuts the hog's throat. I do so, and as "dad" pulls the knife through the hog's throat he shouts and falls back. Naturally the place is now awash in blood. He seems surprised, but I think, What did he expect? So it now falls to me to spray the stain remover on all the blood in the house, even in the attic. I spray this noxious stuff everywhere and it poisons me half to death. I go up in the attic and spray out stains which are blood, again, and look uncomfortably like the scene of the biker's accident at L St. and M St. last week, after the cops had sprayed and labelled all the evidence. Only the stains are in miniature. Only then do I realize I've stumbled into a tangled web, a web spun by three spiders with voices. These, it seems, are Henry Miller's wives (I just finished Jay Martin's biography of Miller), and they have spun an intricate system of webs and strands to complicate each others' lives. Naturally I've stumbled through and destroyed the whole thing. I hear the voice of one of his "wives" say: 'Everything you've said about him and about us is no closer to the truth than anything else anyone has said. You can't say anything true about another human being, you just can't. In order to say anything true about him at all you would need to expand until you *became* Henry yourself..." I look down at the three wives of Henry Miller, now spiders, staking out their territories, fencing one another in, repairing the damage I did. I begin to levitate, and expand, floating on my back, until I *am* Henry Miller, himself... I wake in the exact same position I was levitating in. (369 words)

David: teenage dreams:#102 (03/29/98)It's a gift shop or a toy store or something. I'm walking around in it with my mother -- we're buying gifts for someone. But -- it's more like a party than a gift store, and people are hanging out all over the place. I see Sarah (old lust from Middle School) sitting in the corner, and this really trips me out. I walk over to say hello. She says hello back. I tell her this is really wierd, because I'd just been dreaming about her. As I talk to Sarah and all these other past acquaintances I lose track of my mother. Well, good, I think, and latch onto a group of friends. Sarah tells me she's going to a party, will I come along? Well, even though it's the middle of Los Angeles and I don't know what hotel my parents are staying in, I say okay, because I want an adventure, not another damn number of days ruined by my family. So I go with Sarah to this party in an apartment building. I keep hearing this jazz music. We go into the room and it's Thelonius Monk playing the piano! He's got a lunatic eight or nine-string upright bass, and he's trying to play with this amateur bassist, to show him a few things. I think, if he'll put up with that guy, maybe he won't mind if I noodle around a little on his piano. So I walk over to the shiny black grand piano and play a little bluesy ditty -- immediately I hear shouts coming from inside the piano. I get up and distance myself from it. Two groggy, angry skinheads crawl out and collapse on the floor, bleeding. They nurse the wounds I accidentally gave them and I join Monk at the piano. He shows me a melody and I improvise, but it's clear he wants me to go away, so I drift into conversation. I begin talking to two middle-aged black men. One is very lanky and shirtless, and has this wierd yellow fungus growing all over him. Vaguely as we talk I wonder if it's contagious. He has a very 'gay' manner. 

"You know who the French are erecting a national *monument* to?"

"Who?" says the other.

"James *Baldwin*, if you can believe that."

"I know him," I say. "When I was younger, I read 'Another Country' straight through."

It seems they didn't actually *like* James Baldwin, though, because I was then immediately excluded from the conversation. Baldwin, to them, was a fundamental issue.

So Brad comes along and we go to a party outside, on the hill, on the grass. Charles Bukowski is there with his girlfriend -- they're both young. It's a very warm night. Bukowski recites a few poems and everyone claps. I start to 'thank' him for one of his books, but then I remember his comment about that [in a book I had just flipped through] and forget it. I just talk to him and his girlfriend. But soon, Bukowski has to leave to do a poetry reading tour. So he gets in his huge armored car with his entourage and they dash off. His girlfriend is standing there, crying. Sarah puts her arm around her neck and I rub her back and hug her. I feel sorry for her that Bukowski has to leave so often, but at the same time I sense sexual possiblities between us. (Boy am I sensitive!) Then we come back to the plot of grass in Los Angeles. We look into the sky and every constellation is crammed into this absurd tiny space of sky. The rest of the sky was pitch black. I think "I didn't know you could see the stars in L.A." Somebody points out one constellation I've never seen before, a bird made of green stars with a glowing vibrant blue star for an eye. Everyone points the bird out. When I look back down to the plot, I realize Brad is gone.

"Well, shit," I think to myself.

"Your ride's gone," says Bukowski's girlfriend.

"That's alright. I don't even know what my parents' hotel was. I'll just catch a bus home later."

As we walk away from the place, I wonder who would be more likely to sleep with me, Sarah or Bukowski's girlfriend, and I decide on the latter, since she's lonely now. (722 words)

David: teenage dreams:#103 (03/29/98)I'm in my parent's RV. I'm on vacation someplace, again, and I see we're at a college, but this college is unique -- it's set up like a theme park. Each department has its own 'land' to decorate. Thus, here is Physicsland, here is Archaeologyland, etc. I stumble into the department for the study of subcultures -- everything is grungy and citylike. There's graffiti pieces everywhere, covering everything. Hookers are standing around. A street sign that says "TWO" is on the corner -- this was supposed to mean like Second Street, Downtown, etc. Somehow, I stumble into the Porn department. It seems that some religious vandal has been through, ripping the place apart, throwing videotapes and movie reels, film, photos, everywhere. Some bureaucratic vandals have been through, too -- the Porn department is being cut, immediately. The head of the department, a clean-cut, sixtyish, solid woman in a business suit, explains what's happening. As I stand there listening, two or three young women come in, wearing very casual, California surfer-type clothes. When they hear the news they become very, very upset -- one is even crying. they put a lot into their department, after all. Quite apart from the lascivious thought that I would *love* to see the films these ladies made, I feel very sorry for them. They're obviously seeing a lot of their work going down the tubes right now. I talk to one or two of them and make friends; I team up with a graffiti writer, too. We go back to my parents RV but they won't have anything to do with me; I've befriended scum and sluts. Well then, I think, fuck you too. We 'escape', taking the train tracks. Halfway along a strange plant is laying in the tracks, half green, half red. I immediately recognize it for a ludicrously huge celery plant. The red is the roots. I examine it carefully with a special examining hat the graffiti writer gives me. A huge freight train comes by and obliterates the celery. By way of contrast, I suppose, a BART train comes by and is nearly knocked off the tracks by a clod of dirt. Now somehow in here we end up carrying all these huge vegetables. Well, we're going to make our final escape through this person's house, but *somebody* slams a door, and by the time we get outside, it's TOO LATE!!! Guards are everywhere, and we're trapped. Just then a huge Native American man comes by and strikes a deal. They'll let us go if we divide up our huge veggies. We lay them on a table. We have nine. We would have had ten, but the celery was destroyed. (449 words)

David: teenage dreams:#104 (04/02/98)Brad and I are in the City of Effaced History, trading comments on books. I tell him: "You know, I like authors who've got energy first thing, like Hunter Thompson, the Dalai Lama..." Brad throws his hands up in the air. "Yes!" We get to the house. It's being held hostage by a bearded guy from the Irish Republican Army, because of a schism over the interpretation of a Buddhist text. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#105 (04/05/98)Later: In a courtyard I've seen before. Old yellow adobe buildings with old neon signs -- you know, letters outlined. I need to take a crap, so I go. While I'm on this huge concrete toilet in a large stall, a 'gang' comes in and begins gruesomely killing the person in the stall next to me. A woman who looks familiar comes into my stall and tells me she's not into what they're doing; she's going to do every perverted thing to me she's always wanted to do to a man. Okay! So she proceeds to do so. Once she's finished, I turn around and see she's metamorphosed into Laura. I hand her a copy of "V." by Thomas Pynchon. 

"This is a good book," I say. The telephone rings. I pick it up and say a lot of things in French in a gravelly voice. Finally Eric says: "David? Is that you? I knew it was you. Where are you, dude?"

"I was about to go down the coast, but it's been an hour and a half since Jimmy said he'd take me!"

"Right," says Jimmy, pulling on his pants. I remember it's storming outside, and that all this had something to do with Rhonda (female friend from highschool). (210 words)

David: teenage dreams:#106 (05/05/98)Inchoherency. I'm in a motel in town. Brad and Kathleen are in the room, which is filled with many huge bags of cheap books. I'm at the desk, writing my book. I set down the pen and go out; it starts to rain. I explain the ocean while watching the actions of a beautiful vain brunette woman on a bicycle, who later poses before the mirror admiring her own body. Sometimes she wears sweats, sometimes wears a leather thong and nothing else. Phenomenal legs. Many many months pass. A bar that everybody went into, and never came out of. Jimmy, Brad, other friends come and go. I was writing an autobiography. Water running hard through gutter. Trying to jump and grab rafters at end. (124 words)

David: teenage dreams:#107 (05/10/98)Laura and I are having sex. On a bus. In China. The driver got lost on his way to the hills. (21 words)

David: teenage dreams:#108 (05/29/98)I was reading books that Will had just written. Very Will. The covers were dark, mottled, evil looking, with shadowy pictures of him all over them, smoking cigarettes, wearing his boots, being evil. I read them through. They seemed very much like something Will would write, very natural. I thought they were unfocused, diffuse, full of sarcastic laughter and evil -- very good. They were like other of his writings but much better. 

Then, Brad and I were working on a corpse. These were the remains of a French abbe, a monk who lived in the fourteenth century. We were smashing his bones in the name of research. Or rather, I was. Because earlier I had a choice of occupation, and I chose smashing his bones, because the other job, sawing through his meat, was far too grisly for my stomach. Smashing his bones was the least gory and unpleasant of all the research Brad had to offer me. Even then, after I had the abbe's bones all laid out on the table and I picked up the skull and my hammer, I had an enormous amount of difficulty bringing myself to smash the skull in. Something about it was still too human, still too alive.

Then I guess I took a break or something, because all of a sudden I'm in a bakery, waiting in line. I ordered candied bread -- they didn't have any of that. So instead I got a loaf of raisin bread. As the baker, a young guy with blond hair and a yellow shirt, got the bread, I told him about my adventures with the abbe's bones. He was very unamused and glared at me with the most intensely angry, chilling blue eyes I have ever seen. Perhaps he was a Christian. Wisely, probably, I left the bakery and went back to bone-smashing.

When I came back, I learned that we were doing this research in the name of the National Geographic Society. No sooner had I set my loaf of bread down and picked up my hammer to keep smashing monk-bones when hot damn but George from Seinfeld reportedly steps on the work site. The resulting crush of tourists made it all but impossible to work. Luckily, I only had a metatarsal or two to grind into powder, so I finished up and packaged the dust up for Brad.

Whoops! Brad was suppossed to send the monk's bone-dust to "Cancun in China" but he sent it to somewhere called Xencin; transliteration error. Disastrous! The gleeful natives of Cancun, China nearly stole it for use as an aphrodisiac (Traditional Chinese Aphrodisiac: Powdered Monk Bones), but they sent it back to us after concluding they were on the side of science. Close one.

I guess it's after work, because now I'm passing the downtown library. I walk by the window; sitting at the tables, reading books, frozen in sleep, are all my friends from highschool. They are all asleep, sitting up straight, holding their books open. Josh in particular (a short guy with a beard, shoulder-length hair, leather jacket, smell of cologne, very soft-spoken and intelligent) has a half-there smile on his face, as though he knew I was outside the window, looking in, but he's too sharp to let people know he's awake when he's supposed to be asleep. The library was dark and closed, so evidently all these friends of mine had gotten trapped inside when the library closed, and so they had to sleep there, in the middle of their studies. Though it was more like their bodies had been put in suspended animation -- there was a very strong feeling that my friends in the window -- Josh, Nathan, Mike, and others -- had been *preserved* there somehow from time immemorial, as though they only gave the appearance of life. As though dust built up on them day after day after day, like they'd been pickled or formaldehyded and stuck with pins into their current "studying" positions.

Now I'm in some house, a hippie house in town. I'm in the main room with a very hostile guitarist. Every time I come near him he scowls and lashes out with a limb. So I keep to the other side of the room, amongst the huge pile of used books and board games. I see that these are separated into two main piles: civil rights materials, and a large pile of books and games about sex which dated from the seventies, and some porn magazines of the same era. Laura showed up from nowhere, and insisted I say something brilliant-sounding about the civil rights movement. Off the top of my head I said: "I think it was the defining political movement of the late twentieth century!"

I woke up at this point to use the bathroom, then I climbed back in bed and tried to go back to sleep. Alas, awaiting me in that half-world between sleep and waking, was an intensely frightening blue face, perfectly round, set off in the darkness. It looked like it was made of blue metal. STARING AT ME. Just this BLUE FACE, leering at me with this stupid, malevolent, menacing look. (864 words)

David: teenage dreams:#109 (06/11/98)Laura and I are at Kelly's place. We're working down on the road with a bunch of religious people. Kelly tells us to go to their bagel bakery. The baker, Que Cho (ficticious person), will give us each a bagel. Que Cho looks like he was a professional hit man before he turned to bagel baking. His skin is sompletely pockmarked and scarred, and his nose has definitely been broken more than once. Que Cho gives us each a bagel. We go back to the road. At 2 o'clock I hear somebody ask How much longer will it be until 'Jesus Hour'? Fifteen minutes, the other replies. I run back up to the house and find Laura in Kelly's room. "Kelly!" I say. "They're about to have Jesus Hour. I didn't want to get caught up in it so I came up to get Laura." 

"Don't worry," says Kelly. "When they ring the bell for Jesus Hour, just go into the closet there to hide. Later you can go by the bagel place again." Kelly picks up a stack of papers. "I had to learn a bunch of songs for today's Jesus Hour, so I can't really skip out."

They ring the bell and Laura and I go to hide in the closet. When everyone's gone, we go back to the bakery. We ask for another free bagel, and Que Cho gives it to us, but it's pretty clear that we're *really* pushing our luck with this guy. We get out as fast as we can.

For one brief instant, I'm walking up the large set of stairs at the Green Middle School. I walk by my 8th grade history teacher's room, and he's teaching a class.

Back in Kelly's room. Jesus Hour is almost over, and I really have to piss, but we can't find the bathroom, so I end up pissing in jars, cups, bowls, interrupting the flow every time the containers filled up. This went on for an absurdly long period until finally I woke up to use the bathroom. (343 words)

David: teenage dreams:#110 (06/16/98)We were cabin camping, Laura and I, but there was this strange guy following us all around the place. When he went away, Laura decided to do a little investigating and invaded his house: she examined the construction of his door, and the health of his animals. When we heard him coming we ran for it back to our cabin, and pulled the door, the blinds shut. Next day I left the cabin and out on the curb I met a Filipino kid with a skateboard. He broke something with it, he told me, and now he was fleeing his parents so he wouldn't have to 'pay'. I harbored him and his sister. His sister was younger than him, maybe eight years old, and she sat in the corner with her knees pulled up to her chest, skirt pulled up too far, rocking back and forth and chattering about everything a million miles an hour in a little squeaky voice. I remember that she was wearing white panties. I found a book on the floor that had a really creepy picture of how she would look as an adult in a leotard. Outside, the kid's parents were approaching. I told the kids: 'Go hide in the closet and pretend you're immortal!' This was supposed to protect them from their parents, but it was too late: the parents had seen us all together. They did this wierd bouncing thing, where they would take a step forward, sink down into their knees, bounce up, and step forward again, all with a transfixed glassy expression on their faces, chanting "Na na na! Na na na!" As if this wasn't enough, they were dressed like Mayflower Pilgrims. They cornered us -- the kids gave me something to read. After reading the kids' story, I said, "I put my faith in the children, not in *these* ruined adults!" and I threw a serape filled up with money at the boy. So the pilgrims shot me. Twice in the body, once in the mouth while they pushed me down into the creek. At this point I got a third person view of myself, and this person looked a lot like Mark Twain; not him, but it looked like him. They shot me/him in the mouth and the back of his head blew off, and green smoke began to pour out of his mouth as he sputtered and spit and sent teeth flying. Then he began to decay in the water. All the music stopped abruptly and I woke. Bleh. (423 words)

David: teenage dreams:#111 (06/26/98)Some crotchety old bastard was paying me to completely rewrite all of Douglas Adams' books, because he didn't like a lot of the things that were in them. And he wanted to get some things of his own in. I was instructed to give it a really long title in 18th century style: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, or, the adventures of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent blah blah blahblah blah for twelve pages. 

I was shopping at the food store with Laura. They had a new system -- you bought your food and rung it up yourself! Laura told me to get certain things, and whenever I got the wrong thing (due to some misunderstanding) she'd correct me. I was getting really irritated with her by the time she corrected me about the cereal. I poured back the wrong cereal and poured into my bag a cereal made from long strands of wheat and long strands of dried carrots. Just then Laura began helping this guy with long hair. His hair looked just like the cereal. (178 words)

David: teenage dreams:#112 (06/30/98)(Wartime in a besieged city. WWII trappings. Our hero is leaning against the wall, weeping, saying what may be his last farewell to his lover, who is also crying. A sharply dressed middle-aged man stiffly walks up to the scene. He is wearing a general's uniform.) THE GENERAL: "It is time to go to the Rue des Quatre Mains, sir." (The hero nods. Romantic music swells and fills the scene. The General moves off, and the hero delivers an impassioned speech to his lover.) THE HERO: "I'll never leave you, not even in the hour of death. If they catch me in the battle and execute me later, promise to understand, promise, that I will always be with you, always!" THE LOVER: "I promise!" (She wipes away a tear. The romantic music grows to a deafening pitch and weeping fills the theater. At the Lover's "I promise" the crowd in the movie theater does a standing ovation.) MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE: "BRavo! BRRRRrrrrravo!! What a beautiful scene! How touching!" (All the above noise cuts short as we see (third person view) that I am the author of the above scene. I am sitting on a rock, and I have just finished writing the final words spoken to the lover before being taken to his final battle. Two middle-aged women sit nearby.) WOMAN I: "I hear he's an author." WOMAN II: "That so? What's he working on?" WOMAN I: "A movie, I think." WOMAN II: "Hmm! Imagine that." (247 words)

David: teenage dreams:#113 (07/02/98)Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and Darth Vader were fighting with light sabers -- Marty McFly (Michael Fox) and Luke Skywalker were in on the action, too. At some point Marty McFly killed Luke Skywalker. Then Doc killed Darth Vader. Somehow, then, Doc was fighting his evil twin, and then somehow the good Doc became evil, too. In the end, the one evil Doc killed off the other evil Doc, and the surviving evil Doc began walking towards me, swirling his light saber around in a circle. Then the end of the saber kind of 'broke' and the evil Doc cut off his own head. It sailed through the air and hit the ground, spewing blood. Doc's head croaked: "Entire life's work... up in smoke..." Marty McFly jumped up and shouted "DOC!" like in the movie. A group of tourists walked by, but they didn't notice anything. (145 words)

David: teenage dreams:#114 (07/03/98)Dreamt about a concentration camp. I was going to rescue some people from Birkenau. A gaunt, half-starved Jewish man who looked like Kafka was guiding me. I remember, I didn't want to see the dead bodies particularly. (37 words)

David: teenage dreams:#115 (07/04/98)I dreamt all night long, but now I only remember snatches -- a spider dream, a dream about camping, one at the Hillside Library, and one about some strange backwoods country dance where one man had three dozen pairs of clay eyes running up and down the bridge of his nose, and this girl who was previously thought ugly redid her hair and ended up being gorgeous. "All the men's eyes" were on her, and the singer of the band with the three dozen eyes had them all trained on her. So the singer's three dozen eyes was supposed to represent the eyes of all the men at the dance. (110 words)

David: teenage dreams:#116 (07/05/98)I was on the bus to Hillside, and I noticed that up by the front of the bus there was a table with a pile of books for sale to whoever would want them. I flipped through the pile and they were all good books, but I didn't have any money, or not much at least. Eventually I got a Hemingway book, "A Farewell to Arms", I believe. Back at the bus station to pay for my book. As I'm waiting for the driver I hear gunshots; people right next to me have gotten their heads blown off. One guy has half his head across the way and is writhing all over the place. I calmly step over the bodies and head for the bus. But the bus is leaving! Shit! I begin to run down the street in an effort to arrive at the next bus stop before it does (usually an easy thing with the Hillside buses) but suddenly everything in that part of town turns into a really dense meadow with really tall grass, and I can't get through it fast enough to catch the bus. 

Somehow, later, I'm walking along, flipping through my new copy of "A Farewell to Arms" and suddenly I'm in 1920's Italy. Early 1920's. (Hemingway's book is set in 1917-1918 Italy.) I'm in the ballroom of a really fancy Italian hotel. It is filled with all kinds of people. A curtain draws back and we see Ernest Hemingway. He reads a notice: "All fairies, raise their hands!" A naked, hairy, fat man raises his rifle, hoots, and shoots out the light. Confusion ensues. When the light comes back on, there are 20 or 30 transvestites in shiny evening dress standing around a pool. One by one they're shot and fall into the pool. I think it's all Hemingway's doing, and that he must be standing behind that curtain, shooting them down. I think it's sick, but I don't know how to stop it, and besides, I'm out of my real time (echoes of Back to the Future again) and I don't really want to either endanger my own life or mess up history. I escape this madness by using the emergency elevator, which basically just drops you to the first floor, knoking your lower jaw through the crown of your skull on impact. Or that's how it feels, anyway. The doors slide open and I stagger into the lobby, and out onto the steps. It is a peaceful spring morning in Italy, Florence, I think. Firenzi. It is the 1920's. Hemingway is sitting by the exit, bandage wrapped around his head, staring off into space, whistling an aimless tune. (447 words)

David: teenage dreams:#117 (07/06/98)Laura and I are half-buried in the mud at the bottom of the train tunnel, laying down and hiding out. We were hiding there, I explained, for the same reasons the bums hung out at the opening end every morning -- it was a hell of a lot warmer than any other place at that time of day, due to the draft. Suddenly they built a train station around us. It would take you to New York City. It was all shiny and modern-looking, and Laura and I did go to New York. I considered how close New York was all along, and wondered why we never went. We came back and I went to work at the Green City Library with Larry. That woman Patti was at the desk. At closing time, a woman walked in and Patti refused to help her. "We're closed. Sorry. That's all. We're closed." Then she started *doing her makeup* and putting on jewelry. That annoyed me a lot. She refused to help someone at one minute to closing because she wanted to put on makeup? Larry walked with me across the wierd hills to the train station and explained how he could take my job on Mondays since I didn't like it on that day. And I was going anyway. "Yeah, but I want to *save* money before we go, and I'd lose $120 a month that way!" ($120 is 1/3 of my paycheck; I work 3 days a week.) "Besides, Laura wants to take Biology 3C and..." "But, I'm not *in* highschool anymore," she protests. "We could leave any day!" (268 words)

David: teenage dreams:#118 (07/07/98)I dreamt that I was writing quite a bit. I remember squeezing Laura's breasts, and somebody was passing around an inflatable woman. (22 words)

David: teenage dreams:#119 (07/08/98)I'm waiting to be picked up to go somewhere far away with Jimmy and I'm not sure what music to listen to -- after a while I pick Tori Amos. I pack and get all ready to go. Remembering my experience last time of not having anything to read, I load up my backpack not just with notebooks but with about 20 books, mostly 3 big shiny books by Bernard Shaw. I get into the van with Kelly and her new trucker boyfriend who wonders why I read so much. Then we're taking a bit of a break before leaving and I'm crossing this huge, rickety, wooden footbridge over the river at night. It's raining pretty hard and everything's wet and glistening. Halfway along I notice all kinds of loose change scattered across the bridge, so I go about picking it all up, especially the pennies, because "I'll need all the luck I can get." I find one really huge penny -- it's about a foot in diameter. This one's really lucky. As I'm kneeling to pick up all the change, a man comes along with his two kids. I don't want to look suspicious, so I open the cabinet in the side of the bridge and pull out two cans of Coke. He shines a flashlight on me, then goes away with his kids. (225 words)

David: teenage dreams:#120 (07/11/98)I was a delivery driver in Green City. Here there were a special kind of spiders which would help you find your way: they laid their eggs around a light and made it glow. Then I was in a fancy Indian Southwestern hotel which was like a movie theater. There were a lot of porn stars, and an orgy. A lot of dead rich people. They left me and Laura stuff. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#121 (07/14/98)Laura sold the minivan and bought, for $6000, an inflatable Mustang hovercraft. She called it an Air Car. If you drained it of air, you could fold it up and pack it away. We went for a ride in it. She told me more about it as she stood in the kitchen, naked, intermittently drinking from a glass of water. (60 words)

David: teenage dreams:#122 (07/18/98)I was in my parents' house checking email, and somehow or other the dream got transferred to some kind of workplace. One of my coworkers was a black woman and I discovered to my horror that somebody had sent her a message IN MY NAME inviting her to a movie and calling her a nigger. In my parents' house I found a dream notebook containing several lost dreams, or dreams I thought I had lost forever. I sat down at the computer to type these out in email for Jimmy; that's when I discovered the email thing. Well, it changed into an office and I went to apologize to the woman and explain how appalled I was about the message, that I would change my password. I saw a large poster of a middle-aged man with a moustasche above her desk. Supposed to be her father. The caption read: DADDY IN A BAD MOOD: WATCH OUT! There was the same picture with caption on the desk. 

And now I'm at some kind of graduation. Everybody needs to wear a tie, even me, even though I'm wearing a hooded sweatshirt. A lot of people are there: Andy, Jimmy, Brent, Larry, and so on. Someone gives me a tie and I sling it over my shoulder, pretend to be an aviator, antics like that. Then I notice Larry is tying a red tie. I call out to him: "Hey, Larry, this is kind of wierd. I dreamt about you tying a red tie just like that..." "At a graduation," Laura says, eyes wide. "Just like this," I finish, in growing fright. Fright, because I "realize" I dreamt the whole thing before in every detail, exact down to the last, and it has now come %100 true. The scare was so wrenching I woke with a shout. (304 words)

David: teenage dreams:#123 (07/20/98)We bought property in Montana, and a huge stretch of land north of there was a national park. (18 words)

David: teenage dreams:#124 (07/21/98)Last night I dreamt I was at the theater, some kind of theater production that Dylan was somehow involved with. I saw him and called him over, and we talked a while, and he invited me to go over to some cafe down the road. So we walked down the street and he showed me this cafe. All the walls were pink and stuccoed, and the barista stood behind this hole in the wall where he took your orders. Well, Dylan grabbed a 1-liter Coke and left the money on the counter, but I didn't want so much soda, so I ordered a can of Pepsi and set some quarters on the counter. Turns out the guy who ran the place was John of John's Liquors down by Eastern High School. I leaned through the hole in the wall to place my order and saw Jack sitting there, not really doing anything besides staring off into space. He took a shot of whiskey and ignored me. Then I noticed his entire extended family in the back of the cafe: his grandparents, sleeping in bed, his parents, and so on. Then, of all people, Elizabeth Church came in through the back door and gave Jack a very loving hug, just as though they had been married and were totally in love despite the 30-year age difference. Eventually Elizabeth got me my soda and I thanked her, and talked with her a while, updating her on what was going on in my life and trading info and so on. Then Dylan and I left the cafe; he waved goodbye to Elizabeth, and we walked out onto the street, which had become a field of wildflowers in the meantime. We walked through the field and I told Dylan I was going to visit that cafe more frequently in the future, since I knew so many people who hung around it, including him and Elizabeth, whereas in other cafes I went to nobody knew me at all. I told him about everything going on in my life, my plans, my book, my girlfriend (soon to be wife). At this point Dylan said something like, "The artist's job, you see, is to frame beauty in its proper setting," and we nearly tripped over Laura, who was laying on her side, naked, in the wildflowers. I introduced her and Dylan, and then we stepped over her and kept walking through the field, discussing. (407 words)

David: teenage dreams:#125 (07/23/98)A huge volcano long thought to be extinct, was erupting outside the house in Green City, sending down enormous flaming chunks of ice. I finally got into the house safely along with some few teenage girls, friends of my brother. I sat down in a booth in the living room -- it had booths just like a restaurant -- and played the guitar for my grandparents. I then went and fetched from the car some Hemingway book I bought in hardcover. Somehow, the Starship Enterprise, with warp drive beams emerging fromt the eyes of Worf and Captain Picard, had something to do with the erupting volcano. I got into a conversation with this guy in the house about language and how we develop habits of hiding behind smiles and kind words in conversation, when all we really want to do is smash in their goddamn faces. He tells me this with a strained smile. At this point my dad stands up, excusing himself to piss. I've got to do the same. We were all waiting out the volcano, see. (179 words)

David: teenage dreams:#126 (07/24/98)I was a little fat boy chasing a strange bird. It had the face of a rat with huge eyes, and huge black wings with gold tips that it beat as quickly as a hummingbird. I chased it into a meadow, whereupon I learned that the way it disguises itself is by burying itself headfirst in the dirt and sprouting a flower out its ass, so you can't tell the birds from the flowers nor the flowers from the birds. (80 words)

David: teenage dreams:#127 (07/26/98)Jimmy wanted to do something for my birthday, something I didn't want to do. Naturally, he didn't listen when I told him so, and I was constrained to hide in the old wood stove at my parents' house (I used to hide in it when I was very little.) (49 words)

David: teenage dreams:#128 (08/04/98)Bitter and angry about everything in Hillside. The Market was closing, and they wouldn't let me withdraw money. Ended dream by strangling Jimmy because he wouldn't park his damn van, just kept driving it back and forth. Laura ran up at the same moment and asked what I was doing -- just then I woke up and she was staring at me. Angry like I can't usually be -- at *everything*. Punching walls of the van. Then, after getting rid of Jimmy, we had a bum in our room. We were sitting there talking and he kind of transformed into Alan. He tells me (gold ring in his ear) It's better to be a free man than a bondsman. (Echoes of Thomas More!) I told him that all walks of life come with their own worries, troubles, bothers. He then changed into that guy from a local coffee shop, the grey-haired guy with the leather coat. He began to lecture me in that condescending way bums have when they think you don't understand just how demeaning and uncomfortable their lives are. "Now listen John, Joseph, James Josh..." He began every sentence directed at me with this formula. At one point I opened the door to force him out. (208 words)

David: teenage dreams:#129 (08/07/98)I dreamt I was going to meet Frank at the Green City Movie Theater for a movie. But I got stuck at the Hillside Library trying to find a copy of Steinbeck's book, Sea of Cortez, in a really cheap edition put out from someone's typewriter and facsimile machine. Came time to go--20 minutes past my shift's end. I ran down to Hillside and boarded two enormous German Shepherd dogs. This was a really archaic form of transportation, apparently, like caveman-transportation. I rode on the back of one until it got tired and then I switched. These dogs didn't know me too well, though, so I got a lot of bites and scratches. (113 words)

David: teenage dreams:#130 (08/12/98)First I dreamt that I was operating a little RC research car on the planet Mars. While the car was going around collecting samples of minerals, etc. I was sitting in a station somewhere on the planet. I screwed up somehow at some point and the little RC car broke open the door of my station, allowing the zero-atmosphere of Mars to rush in and destroy all life inside, including mine. (71 words)

David: teenage dreams:#131 (08/12/98)I was standing on a road near Hillside, in the middle of the night, with my supervisor. She handed me a library video and told me I needed to return it. I agreed to return it for her, and I walked over to where the Denny's is in reality. In my dream there was another building here which I lived in. I got into my room all filled with books and records and food, and suddenly there came a knock on the door. Somehow I *knew* the knocking was some old friends of mine I didn't want to see, so I didn't open the door. (My room, by the way, was like a janitor's closet in some institution. There were no windows and the only light came from a bare bulb hanging in the middle of the room.) Still, it was nice to have visitors, so I went ahead and peeked out the door. Mistake. Matt and Steve forced their way into the room. They made havoc out of a good deal of things until Robinson Jeffers showed up (poet, American, 1887-1963). I imagined him from a characoal drawing on the cover of a collection of his poems I just bought. I really had to pee, but the only thing around was a paper bag, so I pissed in that. When it was filled up and beginning to leak out the bottom, I ran into the hallway to dump it out. Naturally I had to pee when I woke up at this point. (253 words)

David: teenage dreams:#132 (08/12/98)I was down on the road I used to live on in Green City, at the bottom of the driveway where Cara used to live. Here there was a soft, marshy sort of area and in the middle of it, a tombstone. I forget what the exact words were on the thing but the gist was: some kid had run away from home and accidentally stepped into this marsh, which sucked him under and killed him. The tombstone had been placed there to warn all future runaways. I don't know how the tombstone stayed there. A whole bunch of other kids gathered and sat down around the tombstone and talked to me about it. Yeah, it's really sad, they agreed, but some kids really *need* to run away from home. Besides, there's not that many marshes out there. (138 words)

David: teenage dreams:#133 (08/12/98)I was at work and needed to take the bus back to town. So I walked down to the pickup point to get on the bus, and found there was no bus, only three or four beat-up old pickup trucks driven by good-ol-boys. Some disreputable old people from the apartment complex, Morton and his wife, plus another guy that stares at me a lot, were waiting in line, too. "Morton" and his wife were shouting at one another as usual, and the other old guy just stood there, being unnerving. Luckily, they all got in this one blue pickup together. I got in the red one behind them. As I got in the car, I asked: "So. We're going to S City?" Without really answering, the guy said: "Shuttle to B Town!" I was clasping a dollar in my hand and I resolved not to pay if I could possibly avoid it. There was a long drive along a crazy screwed up road, and the upshot was, in order to get to B Town at all we had to drive over the treetops of this really dense forest. So the goodolboy begins driving over the trees and the guy in the back really begins protesting violently, which makes the goodolboy lose his concentration (it takes a lot of concentration to drive on treetops, you know!) and the car kind of tips like a boat taking on water, and then finally falls through the trees twenty or thirty feet. Lucky for me my window was open -- I clambered through the window just as the car tipped onto its side, and took refuge in a branch. When the car hit the ground I climbed down the tree and joined the people. The other passenger was laying motionless at the bottom of a chainlink fence (wind knocked out) and same with the goodolboy. They were both alive, though, and arguing enough that I could sneak off without paying. 

The chainlink fence, as it turned out, was guarding my parents' Summer Palace. This was a huge sprawling mansion, most of its rooms hardly even used, three or four used intensively. The place was a thorough disaster. In one room the walls were lined with peeling cork. (Proust?) There was a stack of books like the donation pile at the Hillside library. These were paperbacks I have looked at in the used book store, but have decided not to buy. I was very happy to find them just sitting here now, though, because it meant I could have them for free, when it wasn't worth the two or three dollars apiece to buy them. There were books by Melville and Henry Fielding, both of whom I've had a lukewarm interest in this past month. Laura was with me in this room. She said: "Gee, it's too bad my mother doesn't live here. She deserves a big place like this." Just at that point, her mother showed up and whooshed around in her normal way, apologizing for the mess and attending to one thousand little errands at the speed of light in order to get them all done before dinner in a half hour. You get the feeling she's been going like that all day long. In an aside she mentioned to me that if I wanted to give music lessons, I can do it in her name and she'll pay me under the table, since she's registered and it would be a pain in the ass for me to register, since I'm going to be leaving in a few months. Then Laura and I walk into the next room. Here are where all the registration forms are to be found. Laura hadn't heard her mother tell me I could give lessons in her name, so I begin telling her. Right as I'm about to give away the game the old lady in charge of registrations totters up and asks me what I'm doing. "Registering to give piano lessons!" She hands me a registration form, and tells me sweetly that I really must register, since it's very illegal to give lessons without registering, etc. etc. etc. I smile and let her dodder off into the other hallways of the mansion. I turn to Laura with a look like "Whew! That was a close one!" and I wake up. (723 words)

David: teenage dreams:#134 (08/18/98)I kept dreaming about an underground room. I woke at one point thinking, 'Gee, that was Freudian." Later I dreamt of a box in a tall cabinet containing beans Laura and I had sprouted and forgotten about. They had grown somehow into lush green plants, vines which clung to the walls of the cabinet, with leaves that resembled staghorn ferns. (60 words)

David: teenage dreams:#135 (08/19/98)My supervisor tried the lights in the main room of the library -- for some reason they wouldn't go on for her. Me either. So we decided to tell Lauren we couldn't open the library because there would be no light. Lauren showed up and banged on the door -- I let her in, scowling, and told her what was happening, whereupon she tried the lights and found they worked for her. DAMN. So we had to run through the whole process of setting up, and I was angry with my supervisor for having raised my hopes in the first place. In the other room it was exactly the way everything had been in my room in Green City, except instead of my bookcase there was the pamphlet file, and of course I had no bed there. Hiding behind my chair and a large pile of books I poked idly through the 'A' file. In between American Artists and American Indians I was secretly composing a book, a few pages at a time. At one point Lauren burst in, but thankfully she didn't notice what I was doing. Somehow I began reading a pamphlet about Ed Ricketts, and I began to see the scene as it was narrated by a Steinbeck-like voice: "Back in the thirties, we hired Ed to do some rock crushing for us." (The view slowly zoomed in on Ricketts, who was standing behind a large pile of rocks in work overalls from the thirties, holding a shovel. He was beckoning me over. Narrator:) "Come over here," he said to me one day. "Look at this." (I walked up and saw that he had dug up some strange sort of tree, one which had branches coming off it like a trimmed palm tree -- that is, the branches had been sawed off -- but these chevron-shaped branches had the color and consistency of celery. Narrator:) "Ed! Thank God you cut this off at the root, because that's a part we can regrow. This is a water-bowl tree, Ed. It'll bring us a fortune!" (Ed flushed and looked abashed. He helped me pick up the tree and load it into the nursery. While this scene was going on the voice-over said:) "I think the waterbowl tree brought us $900 in 1948, the year of Rickett's death. With the money we established a memorial. I hope Ed, wherever he is, understands what we have done. These words were taken from John Steinbeck's "My Life in California"." (417 words)

David: teenage dreams:#136 (09/25/98)I was at a party of some sort, with all kinds of people from the Middle School. The crowd at this party is a very select group. They are people from the Middle School, whom I subsequently met, after gradution, under different circumstances. Thus it is an odd collection: Kelly J. and Jasmine are there, as well as that girl named Shannon. Many people who would never mix are here, because I ran into them in later life. Notably absent are most of my infatuations, though I later met some of them. The only one here is Amy. I talk to her for a little while, and she gives me her phone number, tells me to call her, and then, after I talk to Kelly J. a bit more, I dreamt I woke up. But I woke up in some mythical apartment; I did not wake into my real life but into some alternate life. Here I write down the phone number Amy gave me in my dream and after a brief hesitation, I dialed it. A man answered the phone, presumably her father, and I asked for Amy. He got her and we talked for a while. "But how did you find my number?" "Well, it's really wierd... I dreamt you gave it to me." The upshot of the conversation was I was to come and visit her, in the state she had moved to, so we could talk. I promised I'd be there as soon as I could. So I got in a car and drove to her house. She greeted me and showed me her room, and we sat down on the bed and started to talk. We had a lot to say. So much had happened in the meantime. She produced a thick bundle of papers which she had written up for college, which described everything in her life and everything she believed in, everything she wanted to do with her life and so on. I had nothing comparable so I went to the car and retrieved the first five chapters of my novel and gave it to her. We sat on the bed -- I mean laid down, and kissed and exhanged a hug. We looked into each other's eyes a while, and decided that we had made a mistake in ever separating. (388 words)

David: teenage dreams:#137 (10/05/98)I had a dream the other night that me, Woody Allen, and Laura were all sitting around a big oak table in the middle of a sparkling white kitchen. We were having a conversation, I don't remember what, but it became clear that this was Woody's beach house and we were staying there a while. We all went to sleep. In the morning Laura and I went out through the kitchen around the side of the building, along a boardwalk which stretched to the beach outside. It was just dawn. My wife was carrying a volleyball, a tennis ball, and a golf ball. When we got to the beach next to the house, we began throwing the balls back and forth, but they all accidentally fell under the house, through those rectangular vent-holes, you know what I'm talking about? My wife tried to get them out with a stick, but that project failed. In the end I tried shoving my arm through the hole and reaching for the balls. I got my shoulder stuck for a minute or two, and at that point Woody Allen joined us. He made the observation that I was stuck in the vent, and the two of them yanked me out of my fix. Then we all stood around in a circle and tossed the volleyball around. (222 words)

David: teenage dreams:#138 (10/06/98)I was standing before the mirror, applying shaving cream to my beard and hair with the back of the razor. Only, I kept getting confused as to what was hair and what was beard, so instead of shaving off the beard like I'd intended, I ended up shaving out little chunks of beard and hair. It looked horrible. I approached my father in shame. My father, in this dream, was a Tibetan nobleman. I set down the camp mirror and made sure everything was set in the camp, and my 'father' and I began to walk up the street. Towards the house. Just outside the house, I found three pennies on the ground and picked them up. Remeber, we're in Tibet. "Odd money," I said. "European money," he said. "No, American." He grabbed them and flung them into the street. Startled by his rage, I said: "Oh, right, dad. Somebody can, uh, trade them in. Buy an apple." He glared at me, then looked up at the menacing clouds in the sky; they were rushing across the sky and were amber-colored and grimy-looking. We entered the portico and I whispered to my father, so the kids wouldn't hear: "Those clouds spell trouble." He nodded, and said: "American money." He fixed me with an earnest look. "They have arrived." (218 words)

David: teenage dreams:#139 (11/01/98)First I'm in a nondescript house. My 'sister' is one of the clerks at the Hillside Market: a short, small, insubstantial brunette girl who always wears piles and piles of clothing, perhaps to add to her size. Anyway, she walks through the house wearing black sweater, black sock hat, black everything, trailed by her simian boyfriend. He has a sloping forehead, eyebrows growing together, he slouches, wears a leather jacket with a chain over a T-shirt with some band logo on it, and dirty jeans. In the meantime the place has coalesced into something resembling my mother-in-law's house, where we're sleeping tonight. I go into the other room to get my biography of James Joyce, and find that my old friend Steve has placed a band logo right over the front cover picture of Joyce, so that the cover looks like a band logo in a straw hat and tailored shirt. I'm somewhat annoyed, because my copy was in perfect condition and it's a good book, but I figure I can get the sticker off. Then I realize that Steve has signed it on the title page: "Hey David This is you're old budy Steve hey!" Idiot. God damn it, I think, dropping the book, because I realize that they've ALL been here. All the old band members of every band I've ever been in has come in and left his sticker and signature on one or another of my books. Thankfully, only some two and a half dozen books, mostly paperbacks, have been ruined, so it's no big loss. The main damage was to Ellmann's Joyce biography. So I go out into the hall carrying nothing, intending to tell Laura about this, when I find my way blocked by my younger brother, Nick. Except in the dream he's my older brother, and over the course of the following conversations and actions, he becomes the actor who plays Frazier's brother on the T.V. show Frazier. He shows me a jar filled with something grey. "What is it?" I ask. "Ashes." "Ashes?" "The ashes of Cary Grant." "Cary Grant was quite a womanizer, wasn't he?" "Yes, he was," says my brother, who shows me a film about all of Cary Grant's women. We then find ourselves in a storage room in my parent's house, riffling through a desk. We're looking for the photographs of Cary Grant's women. I turn up a small rubberbanded pile of hot rod magazines, kept, it seems, primarily for the swimsuit models. Because Nick turns very red and says: "Put those back! Now!" I kind of laugh and say, "What's wrong with them? What's the big deal?" knowing full well why he's so embarrassed, but wanting to cure him of that embarrassment. It doesn't work and he shuts the drawer himself, saying: "They're mine. You can't have them." Now we're in Arizona, my brother and I, with a bottle of Cary Grant's ashes. We're sitting at an old picnic table below a freeway. On the other side of the freeway is a huge red cliff. I open the jar of ashes to get a better look, and like an idiot, I spill them. Now, that would have been fine, except it was a picnic table, so the ashes begin to pour through the spaces between the boards. Frantically, I try to contain the pile and put as much of it as I can back in the jar. My brother, apparently (now the actor-guy) knows all about cleaning up Cary-Grant-ash-spills, and he gives me a straw. He shows me how to clean up the spill and retrieve every ash: all you have to do is put the straw in the jar and point the jar at the cliff; then, you eject the ashes at the cliff. The ashes bounced off the cliff face and swooped around the back of the table, then swooped around you again, hit the cliff face, and bounced back into the jar. The straw was to direct the initial flow, so the outgoing and incoming streams of ashes would not collide and make a mess. (681 words)

David: teenage dreams:#140 (11/01/98)What's happening is that I grew up in a big city back East, and my parents for some reason have decided to move to a suburb in California. Well, they pick a part of town that reminds them of their neighborhood in the old days, and my mother asks me to do her a favor: could I please get our new poodle puppy baptized? I take the little white poodle and begin walking down the street to the church. Even though at the beginning I was supposed to have grown up in New York, reality flashes in for a moment and now I think: good thing I grew up here or I'd never find the church. I make one left, one right, and I walk down a huge corridor of brownstone buildings. Now I begin to descend into the church area, and now the little poodle has been transformed into a little black kitten. I approach the church and its yard, which is filled with people doing things. It looks more like a firestation than a church: it too is made out of brownstone, it is blocky and square, and right in front there are four square fountains, filled with people doing all sorts of outrageous things: playing water polo, having sex, performing religious ceremonies. Well, I start to walk down thinking: it ought to be easy to get the kitten baptized in all this craziness. But right as I begin to get near a pool, one of the Hillside library patrons, a woman I've never talked to or heard talk to anyone, steps forth with her finger out, shaking her head. "No. No. No kittens are allowed in the church." I argue the point with her for several minutes, pointing out the water polo, the sex. She responds that those are human activities, not kitten activities, and that if I wanted the kitten baptized I'd have to go to a kitten church. I'm pretty annoyed by all this, and as I leave I see another one of the library patrons, a big Middle Eastern guy, shaking his head. "Don't you hate that," he laments. "Oh, I don't really care." I had resolved to tell my mother I got the kitten baptized anyway, because it didn't really seem to matter. "Senile old women," he says. "They are all senile." "Well," I try to think of a diplomatic way to disagree. "Some women are old, but not all are senile." At this point I dreamt that I woke up in Laura's mom's house and began to tell Laura the beginning of my dream, which I lost by the time I woke up for real. We have apples and orange juice, (as we'd agreed on the night before for breakfast) and as I'm telling her I keep getting interrupted: people are arriving. An odd assortment of people: Brad's younger brother Stephen, who begins to set up a computer in the corner and some homeless hippie types with boxes of leaves. The hippie types had come up in Hannah's car, and Laura and I sat in the back of her grey station wagon sorting through the boxes of leaves with tweezers. Finally I get to the part where I'm trying to baptize the kitten, and the hippie types demand their boxes of leaves, so we go back inside. I retell dramatically the part where the woman pushes me away, saying 'no', and at the whole discussion involving kitten churches, Stephen just erupts into laughter: he thinks what I'm talking about is real, because he missed the beginning. As he laughs, he begins to drool, and when he wipes his mouth on his sleeve, he accidentally stretches his lip so that it hangs to his chin. Whoops. (623 words)

David: teenage dreams:#141 (11/04/98)Andy sent me some email at some point in the past, and we're standing before a blackboard, discussing the topic: improving social skills. Andy makes a very amusing algebraic equation about the dynamics of meeting new people: "Okay. You're variable a. Right now you're talking to b. a plus b is equal to i, which is a conversation. Meanwhile there's this other person, whose existence you are not even aware of. He's constant L, for Life, because he's a part of existence you don't know about, but who's always there. Now L would like to interpolate himself on the sum-side of this equation..." And he goes on and on in a very erudite manner, graphing it and everything. Now I meet his grandparents and talk to him for a little while about this and that. He tells me something astonishing and I joke: "Well, Bob's your Uncle!" "Grandpa," Andy corrects. "Yours too." And he's right: both of us have grandparents named Bob. Now I'm in S City with Andy, Laura, two guys from Junior High who I haven't thought about since, and the main character of my book, Richard Sampson. We're just walking along, talking; Laura, as usual, is about a mile ahead, trying to avoid conversation. The two guys from junior high are talking about pizza behind us. I'm still talking to Andy about his email message. We begin to climb the scaffolding of the new parking garage downtown, and I'm telling Andy how amusing I thought his email message was, and I sort of respond to it, when Andy intervenes: "Say, shouldn't we really save this for email, to give us something to do when we log on?" I agree and we begin to climb down the scaffolding, having had enough of the view. The two pizza guys behind us suggest going to a pizzeria: apparently they know of a good one. Only, Laura is now two miles ahead and I *know* she doesn't know where the pizzeria is. I wake up before we can all regroup. (339 words)

David: teenage dreams:#142 (11/13/98)Dreamt that I went to visit my old house. My mom was there to greet me: but this was no ordinary Mom. No, this is the anti-Mom. This Mom has her own life. She has things to do. She's busy. She's together; she isn't neurotic. And she's been living in this house all along. Well, she had a job she needed to get to, but she agreed to give me a tour anyway. There was a little girl there, my analogue, or I suppose my homologue, since she would have served a different function in the life of the anti-Mom from the one I serve in real life. The girl was very bouncy and happy. (115 words)

David: teenage dreams:#143 (11/21/98)Hard to describe. First the wharf. Walking along the wharf at night. But it is more than the wharf: it is an entire waterfront, a vast wharf the length of three wharves and the width of twenty wharves. I'm moving with the loose crowd. Suddenly the ocean is filled with dozens of sea monsters. These are vast sea dragons, creatures like giant dogs with scales and spinning paddles for legs, enormous snakes with frayed tails. All the creatures are reptillian. I'm whisked along to the library. A man returns a book on tape which has many of the wrong tapes. Some of the tapes are to be used with a good computer: you pop them in and a movie runs on the screen. Most of the cassettes are audiobook tapes. One is a feature film. Several are porn movies. All are issued by the same individual: a man named Ulric. I grab one of the porn tapes and watch it on the computer. Now I'm in a castle. I ascend to the top floor, porn cassette in hand, intent on finding some private place to jack off. Lo and behold, I soon find Bill Gates' bedroom! There is a curtained bed in the room, just like kings had in castles like this. I go over to the bed, and find that, inside the curtain, there is a state-of-the-art PC installed in the bed. Perfect place, I think to myself: private, comfortable, and fully equipped with just the technology I need. Yet I'm nervous about doing this in another person's room, when I don't even know where that person is. So I decided to forget about the movie and walk downstairs: I need to take a shower. I find a shower room and begin to enter: inside the room, with her back turned to me, is one of the patrons from the Hillside library. She is large, not especially attractive, and about fourteen years old. She is stripping to take a shower. I consider: I don't give a crap about her, and I need a shower. But then: it is highly likely that she would be embarrassed and perhaps even disturbed by the presence of a nude man. Ah, shit, I say to myself. I don't want to upset anybody. So I go off in search of a different shower room, knowing fully that there is no other shower. In my search I find Ulric, who decides to hire me to read a book on tape. But then I tell him I live in my car and this bearded, balding, fat middle-aged man tells me I'm worthless, and he gets very hostile, cancelling the earlier agreement. I tell him I'm going to Mexico, and the bastard begins testing my knowledge of Spanish. I play along, though, never pretending to understand when I don't, and soon enough I uncover the holes in his Spanish. I ask him about a word he used, and he's totally speechless. He can't tell me what the word means. It's like he made it up. Bastard. (509 words)

David: teenage dreams:#144 (12/02/98)I'm going to elope with a gorgeous Jewish woman. But who's standing in our way? William S. Burroughs. I must pass his tests before we can elope. What does his primary and most important test consist of? I must take a one foot length of silk ribbon, and tie it around my neck. Now, while leaving it on my neck, I must stretch it somehow to run down my back, down my pants, around my feet, back up my pants, up through the front of my shirt, and around my neck again into a bow tie. Needless to say, I fail the test. Burroughs goes cackling off, dancing a little jig. We decide to elope anyhow. (116 words)

David: teenage dreams:#145 (12/13/98)I am the Devil, and I'm scheduled to appear in a musical. Everybody else thinks I'm a mere mortal *playing* the Devil, but I know better. I show up at the right time. The musical begins; everything is very Babylonian. There is an enormous man in the middle of the room, wearing a turban and sitting on a throne. The jungle drums begins. He throws his arms up and shakes as the chorus sings: "Seven hundred twenty eight pounds/six hundred of them fat!" Now, it is his part in the musical to jump on me, and then I was to pretend to kill him with the fake weaponry. But since I am the Devil, after all, unmitigated evil incarnate, I opt for hacking him to pieces with my axe for real when he lands on me. The audience marvels at the special effects as I walk off the stage, leaving the dismembered fat man stewing and quivering in his own blood. (161 words)

David: teenage dreams:#146 (12/13/98)I'm on a ferry with my family. The ferry is also a submarine: it's like a submarine/cruise liner. We dive underwater; I'm the only one who missed the notification, and as the ship dives at a ninety degree angle, I careen through several hallway openings before finally crash landing at the front of the ship. I land in a dining room with Nick and the family, and for a while we watch the fish floating by the outside of the glass. The dining room is designed for undersea watching, you see. Nick and I decide we've had enough and go to get our luggage. (104 words)

David: teenage dreams:#147 (12/15/98)Soft piano music with a string orchestra in the background. Autumn leaves fall around the road in a crisp wind. The sun is angling through the trees, casting a gold glow over everything. The massive RV has a large empty space in the middle, and everybody is laying around under blankets inside. The RV is slowing to a halt. It's clear our journey is coming to an end. It is my job to distribute the magazines. I give one to Laura and set one aside for myself. There are two other people I don't know in the RV, and I give them their magazines. I approach Kermit the Frog, who takes a copy of People, and thanks me profusely. I go up to the driver's cockpit as Dr. Teeth (who has been driving) brings the RV to the side of the road. I show him what we have left: Country Living and the Jarvis Catalogue. "Oh yeah man, thanks, just what I need, alright, absotively, possolutely!" He takes them and I retire to my blankets in the back of the RV with my magazine, as the piano music slows and quiets down. I drift slowly out of the dream, feeling very warm and content, thinking: Ah, what a nice dream. It takes me at least ten minutes to begin laughing. (220 words)

David: teenage dreams:#148 (12/26/98)A baby hangs from a ledge by its fingertips, a lit cigarette hanging from its lips. (16 words)

David: teenage dreams:#149 (12/27/98)I was in school again, in those regimented rows of desks, as the teacher (old P.E. teacher) blabbed on about the usual nothing, and then forced us to take one of those standardized tests. In my dream I resisted everything passively but passionately; I somehow managed to lose my test sheet, for instance. And the whole time I felt that sharp adolescent despair, as of a trapped animal, without even words to express himself. (74 words)

David: teenage dreams:#150 (12/28/98)The town had become this strange peat bog, all hemmed in by mist. At one end was 1st and 2nd street, and right after that came Miramar Avenue, on which was Will's house. I was being chased and I found refuge in Will's house. I kept going into the wrong rooms, though, which were all full of his family members, all sound asleep. Finally I found the right room, with Will and all his friends watching a horror/sci-fi movie. Apparently Will was throwing a publication party: Will had had some long school project to do, and so he had farmed sections of it out to each of his friends, and we all wrote a bit of it. The final thing ended up being like 300 pages. The teacher had thought it was so good he had it published as an anthology! I found my bit in it and read it over. The whole thing was printed in a really cool font, with unique margin illustrations on each page. But the odd thing was, this whole innocuous-sounding dream had a very strong atmosphere of foreboding. (184 words)

David: teenage dreams:#151 (12/29/98)There was a burglar burrowing under the house, preparing to drill a hole through the floor under where we were sleeping. I ran to the phone to dial 911 and Laura and I got in the van to escape. (39 words)

David: teenage dreams:#152 (12/30/98)I was getting a tattoo, or rather I wanted to, but for one thing it cost too much and for another thing all the sample designs were pretty unappealing, childish even. I mean, there was one design that looked exactly like a three-year old's drawing. But while I was in the parlor trying to leave, I struck up a conversation with a man who had a really impressive series of tattoos on his head. He had a shaved head (of course) and he had tattooed a celtic band all the way around the base of his skull. On the back of his head was an *amazing* rendering of Quetzalcoatl, and the rest of his head was covered with intertwining Aztec, Mayan, and Celtic designs, which worked together very well. He seemed to be interested in Mexico so I told him I was going there. He told me that when he went there, he had had a good time, but wherever he went people would just stare and stare and stare at him. He was genuinely puzzled as to why people would do this to him. (185 words)

David: teenage dreams:#153 (12/31/98)I'm in my mother-in-law's house, but in my dream this is the new house my parents are building. The back room (which connects to a deck) is Nick's room, in the process of construction. Plastic sheeting is hanging everywhere, and the walls are covered with irregularly placed (but identical) splotches of glowing plaster. In an adjoining room is something called a genealogy machine: you place a book of family history open on it and there it does something, God knows what. This is obviously a nod to the presence of my mother. I went out onto the back porch and realized I was being pursued by Richard Madden, a character in Borges' short story 'The Garden of Forking Paths', who is never described apart from his name, and his function: namely, to chase the narrator with a gun. I ran out under the deck and ducked. Now I'm in the side yard and there is a blonde woman on the porch. A man behind her waves and shouts: "Good bye, pa!" There is a limosuine cruising down the road: a window rolls down and the barrell of a shotgun pokes out. The woman is gone and the man who was standing behind her crumbles a head of garlic over the edge. The cloves hit the ground. There is a bang. Richard Madden has killed the woman instead of me. I walk to the gate and across the driveway a very fragile and ancient Hindu man wearing blue earmuffs shuffles by with his eyes closed. (254 words)

David: teenage dreams:#154 (02/27/99)I was laying stretched on the bed in an Aculpulco hotel, staring through a golden light. Suddenly an amazing rainbow colored cat, made out of light, appears. I recognize it as a dream, and it shrieked. Somehow I managed to keep dreaming, and changed the cat into the pretty chambermaid who I'd been looking at for days. We made love, but she kept trying to turn into the cat in a very irritating way. I had to keep concentrating to keep the figure I was making love to focused as the chambermaid. (92 words)

David: teenage dreams:#155 (07/29/99)I was having sex with a woman whose body looked a lot like Laura's, but I couldn't see her face and it definitely wasn't Laura. (25 words)

David: teenage dreams:#156 (09/13/99)There is a dorm. Laughing. Judi is there; so is Cait. Cait whispers something I'm not supposed to tell Judi. She goes away. I talk to Judi and accidentally she figures out what Cait told me. But Judi isn't disturbed. We laugh and lay down together, and continue talking and laughing. (51 words)

David: teenage dreams:#157 (09/14/99)Somebody was telling me that I should hang on to my fortune, rather than spending it all. (17 words)

David: teenage dreams:#158 (09/15/99)The three of us -- Brad, Laura and myself -- go to a local bar. Instead of it being a grungy bar, it is a very nice multicolored restaurant. We sit down to table on a second floor with three young women. One of them works at a nearby cafe, Stella's; the other two I've never seen before. We all order food. Schoenberg's Op. 11 is playing as background music! (70 words)

David: teenage dreams:#159 (09/16/99)I have a gun for self defense. It's a pistol. There's a switch on the side. If I flip it up, it becomes a light, a flashlight. So I can see through the darkness. If I flip it down, it becomes a weapon. I'm travelling through the Schwarzwald and I hear a noise. Quickly I shut off the light and shoot in the direction of the noise. I hear a howling: it was a cat. I flip the light back on: my sister's cat. I've grazed the left side of her face, which is now a raw bloody spot. But her eyes are fine and she's not seriously injured in any way, only frightened and in pain. I try to catch her, which is hard in the dark, but I eventually do and somehow manage to contain the struggling, howling, scratching, biting, hissing, screaming cat until I can take care of her. Meantime I must watch out for the Germans. (160 words)

David: teenage dreams:#160 (09/17/99)Brad is describing a joke that Hannah once played on him. As Brad tells his story, I see what happened. Brad is climbing up a ladder, embracing a gigantic can of Mountain Dew. He reaches the top and I see that he's on top of a pool slide. Right before going down the slide into the pool, he opens the can. But Hannah had set a trap. The can explodes, drenching Brad with Mountain Dew. He looks so pitifully silly that I wake myself up laughing. (86 words)

David: teenage dreams:#161 (09/18/99)Laura gets undressed and takes a shower. The mirrors are placed so that I can watch her from the bed. I watch and jack off. Later, when she's done, we go into the bathroom together; it's hot and steamy. She informs me that she figured out how to get rid of all her excess cynicism. She opened the window and pointed to all the water condensed in the metal grate in the window. "All that represents excess moisture in the atmosphere." She opened the door and turned on a huge standing fan outside the window. The switch is by the bathroom door. The fan begins blowing, spattering us with droplets of water. "That's what I have to do with my excess cynicism." "What," I joke, "spray us with it?" (129 words)

David: teenage dreams:#162 (09/20/99)The movie theater where I work is different, a wierd amalgamation of an old theater in town, the theater I work at now, and an auto mechanic's shop. Josh is working on something in the back room. He was playing music on a CD player, and we debated how these people got famous and why. Josh points out that the guy we're listening to worked here before. I'm not sure whether "here" referred to the actual theater or just crappy jobs like it. Josh takes his paints, his music, and leaves. Unrecognizable people and myself discuss the fact that Josh has left, and we go out into the second lobby. The box office has been moved here for some wierd reason. We hire a new, sexy girl, who looks a lot like Kitty from the Mayan. She also looks like a girl who works in the local copy shop. Her voice is distorted. Laura shows up late, wanting coffee, but it's too late, all the coffee is gone. Laura begins to describe something she dreamt, and the dream is taken over by that for a while. She finishes. I go into the office, which has become a huge garage. All kinds of tough-ass cowboy types from Wyoming are there. These are the friends of Sasha (supervisor). They beat people up for a living. I drive my old van out of the garage, taking an unusual direction, and find myself in fenced-off corner of the railyard. I park the van at the garage's exit and walk out into the railyard among all the crossings, under a mottled brown sky. The ancient station looms in the background, only it's disturbingly spongy. The earth is brown, rocky, and a little spongy. I see a sign on the building: "Warning: Fast Moving Trains." This looks exactly like the signs over the light rail tracks downtown. A man wearing khaki overalls and a khaki shirt and glasses runs out of the garage. He looks a lot like Harold Lloyd, the silent movie genius. He grabs me by the shoulders and pulls me off the track I'm standing on. A moment later a train screams by. I move to a different track but he yanks me off of that one right before another train nearly obliterates me. This time I notice that the trains are made of the same dry, rocky, spongy stuff as the railyard and station. The tracks are iron and wood. I talk to Lloyd as a third train rushes by on a distant track. Is there any way I could take one of these trains to the South part of town? "Sure," he says, "but go to the goddamn station. Your stuff will catch up with you later." Meantime we'd better get off the tracks. He's the switchman, who sends all the trains onto the right tracks, and only he knows the schedule by heart, well enough to avoid getting pulped by a train. "Look, I can't babysit you all goddamn night, so you better get out of the yard or you'll wind up dead before long." I go back to the van and dig through a U-haul box. I take the most important stuff and fill the backpack with it. Then I drive the van into the garage. The garage had changed into more of a parking garage with ramps and levels. But there's still tools and equipment strewn around everywhere. Before it was a very straightforward auto shop with three or four bays; now it's a confusing maze. To further complicated things, they blocked the entrance, making it necessary for me to go in backwards. The mechanics are irritated with me. (611 words)

David: teenage dreams:#163 (09/21/99)There is the theater. A man asks if there is a donut shop nearby and where. I tell him where and he goes. A woman comes by and asks the same question. I lead her halfway there and she goes the rest of the way. Before long I hear her frantic screams for help. I know that the man I talked to earlier is to blame. Swallowing my fear, I run in the direction of her screams, also shouting for help. (81 words)

David: teenage dreams:#164 (09/21/99)There was a nightclub on the penthouse floor of Smith Tower. Everyone called it "The Smith". Brad said that he for one was getting sick of stepping over piles of dried vomit, passed out drunks, and "other excretions" in the elevator every Saturday and Sunday morning, when he went downstairs to buy a paper. From now on he would take the stairs, since he only lived on the third floor, and drunk people never take the stairs. (77 words)

David: teenage dreams:#165 (09/23/99)I'm at the theater to watch "Xiu Xiu" with Laura. Laura goes into the auditorium and I go to the bathroom. The bathroom is an outsized, dirty locker room, a lot like the locker room at the public pool. I have to piss, and wind up peeing in the disused ashtrays. I hear a voice: Judi emerges from a stall. She has obviously been crying. I ask what I can do and we talk for a while. At length we get far friendlier than usual and have a good fuck on the floor. Afterwards I realize that Laura's probably wondering what the hell happened to me. By the clock only ten minutes had passed, but the sex felt too satisfying for it to have been that short. I decide my watch is wrong, and cross into the lobby. (138 words)

David: teenage dreams:#166 (10/08/99)Something about a nude club for teenagers, who are in general better swimmers than those who go to clubs where swimsuits are required. The connection is never explained. The patrons of the nude club are all issued brown towels, hence the nickname of this club, "The Brown Towel". Gah. While at this club I run into Heather. She's older, taller, more slender, has short tousled dishwater blonde hair, and is really desirable. She's basically standoffish towards me. I ask if she's still in magazine work, and she says yes. She's an editor at a small magazine, but soon she's going to move on to something bigger and better. Then she started up a computer and began working on something. I saw her in profile, and she kept changing into a woman with black hair, severely thin, and basically ugly. (139 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0001 (1949-01-19 - Göttingen)Abschrift aus den Tagebuch vom 13.2.1947: Eine merkwürdige Vermischung der Elemente des Unterbewusstseins im Traum. Ich träume oft von ganz bestimmten, mir genau bekannten Menschen, die sich im Traum genau so benehmen, dass ich sie wiedererkennen kann, und wenn ich ihnen in die Augen blicke, haben sie plötzlich ganz andere, fremde Augen und ich bin enttäuscht oder entsetzt. - Vor allem sind es immer wieder Gesichter - und zwar Augenblickseindrücke bestimmter Gesichter, die mir im Traume wieder begegnen, und insofern ist mir der Traum direkt ein nachträglicher Gradmesser für die Intensität, mit der mich ein bestimmter Gesichtsausdruck irgendeines Menschen im Unterbewusstsein beeindruckt hat.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0002 (1949-01-20 - Göttingen)Ich bin in der russischen Zone, in Schwerin (und zwar nicht früher, sondern in der Gegenwart) und gehe die Schlosstrasse hoch. Da komme ich mit zwei Jungen zusammen und gleich ins Gespräch, von denen der eine mir sehr sympathisch ist und durch eine angenehme und freundliche Art und gepflegte Ausdrucksweise mir auffällt, obwohl er noch sehr jung ist. Ich nenne ihn Du, hab nachher aber das Gefühl, ich hätte ihn Sie nennen müssen. Er ist aber in keiner Weise beleidigt. Das gefällt mir besonders gut. - Ich frage ihn, wie ich zum "Grossen Moor" komme (Parallelstrasse zur Schlosstrasse) und ob dort ein Herr von Hartwig wohne. Das "von" habe ich dabei unwillkürlich besonders betont, wie ich merke. Es zeigt sich, dass er genau orientiert ist. Der ist gerade verreist oder etwas ähnliches. Ich frage noch nach anderen Bekannten meines Vaters, denn ich weiss nicht, wo ich übernachten soll - aber er hat bei jedem einen Grund, warum ich da nicht hin kann und sagt, er sähe es als selbstverständlich an, dass ich zunächst bei ihm übernachte. (dies ist die Stelle, wo mir seine gepflegte Sprache auffällt) - und er müsse nur erst seinen Pflegevater fragen. (195 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0003 (1949-01-20 - Göttingen)Ich träumte dann noch irgend etwas Turbulentes, was mit Plünderung und Überfall - ebenfalls in der östlichen Atmosphäre - zu tun hatte, und zuletzt kam auch der Krieg noch zu seinem Recht. Diesmal war es in Wittmoldt, wo der Weg zum Hof über eine schmale Landzunge führt, - auf ihm gehend. Es schoss. Man sah es aufblitzen, hörte es pfeifen, nahm Deckung. Ich lief immer weiter zum Hof hin. Mein Begleiter rief, er wolle bleiben, wo er wäre, die schössen sich auf den Hof ein. Ich hatte den Eindruck, sie schössen sich gerade auf uns ein, schrie "nein", rannte allein weiter, nahm immer Deckung, presste mich ganz platt auf dem Bauch in eine Erdvertiefung, hatte nur den Gedanken, ins Haus zu kommen, in den Keller, zum den anderen Menschen, lieber dort mit denen umzukommen, als hier allein. - Die Schüsse kommen näher. Dann kam einer, der pfiff immerzu. Ich dachte, er würde mich treffen, - und betete - obwohl ich noch dabei überlegte, dass ich das ja lange nicht mehr getan hätte, weil mich der Zweifel, der Gedanke des Anthropomorphismus irgendwie vor dieser Art der Äusserung zurückhielt. Der Gedanke kam mir auch jetzt (oder wenigstens gleich im Erwachen, das darauf folgte), aber ich tat es trotzdem in innerer Angst. - (210 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0004 (1949-01-20 - Göttingen)Dann träumte ich weiter (es kann sein, dass dies die direkte Fortsetzung des Schweriner Traums (2) war): Wir waren viele in einem Keller in der russischen Zone. Margund kam auch. Ich stellte mich erst in den Hintergrund, um mich nicht vorzudrängen, sie zu begrüssen. Sie setzte sich auf eine Bank an der Wand zwischen andere. Ich konnte sie nicht entdecken. Sie hatte einen braunen Hut tief ins Gesicht gezogen. Ich beugte die Knie, dass ich ihr in die Augen kucken konnte, und erkannte sie sofort. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0005 (1949-01-20 - Göttingen)Letzter Traum heute Nacht: Ich war im Schuhgeschäft, um Schuhe zu kaufen, - sagte dem Mann, ich habe wenig Geld. Er zeigte mir ein Bord: "Kaufen Sie diese, die sind am billigsten zu haben". Dort lagen alte gebrauchte Turnschuhe. Ich probierte ein Paar an. Sie waren weiss und sehr bequem. [Aber unter der Sohle war eine Aber eine darin] (Diese Worte sind im Manuskript gestrichen). Aber die Sohle war kaputt. Aber es war nur eine Art Filz, der unter der eigentlichen Sohle angebracht war und den man ohne Schaden für die Schuhe hätte ganz entfernen können. Ich überlegte lange, als ich die Schuhe anprobiert hatte und in ihnen auf und ab ging, ob ich sie nehmen sollte. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0006 (1949-01-21 - Göttingen)Ich will in eine Vorlesung gehen, die ich sonst nicht höre, um Dorothea H. zu sehen, von der ich weiss, dass sie dort hingeht. Eberhard P. sagt mir: "Diesmal kommt sie schon um dreiviertel, um noch Arbeiten durchzusehen". ich wundere mich, dass sie so etwas tut, sich also wissenschaftlich beschäftigt. - Ich bin in die Vorlesung gegangen. Der Hörsaal ist voll. Ich sitze mit anderen auf dem Tisch vor der ersten Sitzreihe. H. sitzt dort und unterhält sich mit Verschiedenen. Ich kann sie aber nicht richtig zu Gesicht bekommen. Die Vorlesung beginnt. Hinter mir, in der ersten Reihe, sind noch Plätze frei. Ich lasse mich auf einen der Sitze zurückgleiten. Plötzlich ist keiner mehr frei, und ich sitze sozusagen zwischen den Stühlen. Man schimpft. Ich steige wieder nach vorne auf den Tisch (der ja im Mineralogischen Institut, um das es sich handelt, ähnlich wie eine lange Bank die letzte Sitzreihe zum Podium hin abschliesst). Als ich mich dahin setzen will, wo ich vorher sass, heisst es: das ist ja nicht Ihr Platz: Sie sitzen doch da. - Man zeigt irgendwo nach weiter rechts, wo ich nie gesessen hab. Ich kucke dahin mit einer Gebärde des Befremdens und bleibe ruhig sitzen, wo ich hingehöre. Da erhebt sich ein furchtbares Gezeter. Das ganze Auditorium gerät in Aufregung. Der Professor kommt vom Katheder auf mich zu. Ich will ihm entwas entgegnen. Aber er lässt mich gar nicht zu Worte kommen, sondern mit einer etwas spöttischen Miene sagt er: Da vorne (d.i. neben dem Katheder) ist noch ein Stuhl. Ich gehe mit ihm dorthin. Er weist mir einen Stuhl. Ich sage: nein, dieser ist bequemer und setze mich auf den bequemsten mit Seitenlehnen, strecke die Beine aus und mache es mir mit einem gewissen Trotz so bequem wie möglich. Während er später etwas an der Tafel erklärt, denke ich: eigentlich müsste man aus Protest jetzt raus gehen - aber ich tue es nicht, damit es nicht wie ein Weglaufen aus Angst aussieht. - Eine Viertelstunde später fluten viel zu spät Kommende von hinten in den Hörsaal. Man rückt in den Bankreihen zusammen, und sie bekommen alle noch Platz, während ich hier vorne vor den Augen aller mitten auf dem Podium sitze. - Ich suche mit den Augen H. in der ersten Reihe, entdecke sie dort etwas ungenau aus der Ferne und werfe ihr einen triumphierenden Blick zu und gebe mir auf meinem Stuhl einen Ruck, um einen guten Eindruck zu machen. - (408 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0007 (1949-01-21 - Göttingen)Ich laufe nur mit einem Handtuch bekleidet über die Strasse und suche den Eingang zu meiner Wohnung, aber kann ihn plötzlich nicht finden. Schliesslich habe ich ihn. Ich wohne hinter einem Friseurladen. Der Mann ist furchtbar nett und hilfsbereit zu mir. Ich habe einen Kasten für Haferflocken. Der ist kaputt. Der Mann nagelt ihn mir wieder zusammen. Der Hausmeister vom mineralogischen Institut hilft dabei. - Ich sitze und habe zwei Aluminiumtöpfe mit Essenresten von Speisungen. Ich schütte sie beide zusammen, aber der eine war salzig, der andere süss. Ich esse. Da merke ich, dass mir gegenüber Nicolai Hartmann sitzt. Er sagt sehr freundlich zu mir: "Na schmeckt denn das, was Sie da eben gemischt haben." Ich sage: "Na ja, es geht so" - und nach einer Pause, als mir einfällt, dass ich das vergessen habe "Danke". - (137 words)

Ich kann drinnen einen jüngeren Mann mit einer Brille sehen, von dem ich annehme, dass er sie besucht. Ich kehre schnell um, schleiche aus der offenen Wohnungstür, renne die Treppe runter und laufe unten möglichst leise und schnell unter ihrem Fenster vorbei, um nicht gesehen zu werden. - (88 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0010 (1949-01-21 - Göttingen)von vor einem halben Jahr, notiert ebenfalls 21.1.1949: 

Ich bin in unserer Stube mit mehreren Jungen und Mädchen zusammen, mit denen wir am Tag zuvor auf einem sehr netten Fest waren. Plötzlich kracht es furchtbar wie von einer Explosiun. Ich nehme sofort Deckung und krieche flach auf dem Bauch unter meine Couch, auf der eine leuchtend rote Decke liegt. Den anderen rate ich dasselbe, und sie nehmen auch irgendwie Deckung. Nachdem ich eine unbestimmte Weile nichts Bestimmtes erlebt habe, sehe ich meinen Bruder in seinem Bett sich hoch aufrichten - er hat ein weisses Nachthemd an, von dem seine dunklen, im Bett wüsten Haare sich krass abheben, er hält die geballte Faust hoch und wirft etwas auf mich, ich warte, bis es auf mich runterprasselt - : und es fallen lauter - Bonbons auf mich, kleine ostereierartige Fondants. Davon wache ich auf und spüre noch ein Zucken in den Augen und in der Nase und fühle mich sehr mitgenommen. (159 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0011 (1949-01-23 - Göttingen)Ich bin in einem grossen Hause in einer Art Gemeinschaftslager. Es sind schon drei ums Leben gekommen - ich glaube aus Hunger oder irgend einem Unglück -. Sie liegen nebeneinander auf dem Dachboden des Hauses. - Ich gehe das Treppenhaus hoch. (Es ist das Treppenhaus des theolog. Seminars). Dort herrrscht Trubel. Eine Art varietéförmige Aufführung. Ich höre einige Stimmen irgend ein Operettenlied singen. Mein Bruder steht auch da. Er hat nur eine kurze Unterhose und eine Art Turnhemd an, aber eine grosse Fliege umgebunden. Ich finde das unmöglich. Er erzählt begeistert von der Aufführung, sagt aber: sie haben etwas gemacht, was sie nicht dürfen. Ich sehe auch alle betroffen neugierig dastehen. Ein Mann wird die Treppe heraufgetragen. Er liegt auf einer Bahre. Alles steht und gafft. Nirgend kommt man weiter. Ich bin sehr ungehalten und sage zu den Leuten einen Goethe'schen Vers, der mir jetzt entfallen ist und mit den Worten endete "nun geht doch weiter". Sie lassen mich vorbei. Ich sage: Wie kann man nur so rumstehen, wenn einer sich bloss die Hose voll gemacht hat. - Da merke ich, dass der Mann auf der Bahre tot ist und ich mich geirrt habe. Ich bin ganz erschüttert und es sagt in mir "O Gott". Stirn und Haare und die Füsse der Leiche kucken unter der Decke raus. Sie wird neben den drei anderen auf dem Dachboden niedergesetzt. ... Wir sitzen alle in irgendwie innerlich und organisationsmässig zusammengehörigen kleinen Gruppen auf den Tischen. Schäder sagt ein Wort zu unserer kleinen Gruppe - oder lese ich es eigentlich geschrieben wie in einer kleinen Denkschrift von ihm an die Theologen. Den Wortlaut habe ich vergessen, aber es schloss mit den Worten: "die nicht waren, was sie sein sollten" und enthält eine ernste Mahnung, die mich sehr beschäftigt. - (296 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0012 (1949-01-25 - Göttingen)Erster Traum: Ich komme in das Schulgebäude in Schwerin, um ein Hemd zu holen, das ich dort vor Jahren vergessen habe. Es hängt noch an derselben Stelle auf der Kleiderablage draussen auf dem Flur zwischen Sachen der jetztigen Schüler. Ich sehe es auf Anhieb, nehme es, gehe in die Klasse, in der gerade Unterricht ist, um es dem Lehrer vorzuzeigen. Dieser erkennt mich noch. Er ist sehr höflich. Ich sage: Ich wollte Ihnen das Hemd noch erst zeigen, um es nicht so sang- und klanglos verschwinden zu lassen. Er begleitet mich noch vor die Türe und verabschiedet sich sehr höflich. (100 words)

Zum Fenster raussehend, sehe ich auf das Meer direkt unter mir. Ich winke mit einer weissen Mullbinde, die am Bein befestigt ist, hinaus. Sofort tauchen einige schnellbootförmige Fahrzeuge U-Bootartig aus dem Wasser auf. Jemand sagt: das sind die Kreuzer. Ich bin Marineoffizier und finde nichts dabei, dass sie mir zur Hilfe kommen. Sie steuern auf das Ufer zu. Die Leute springen mit Uniform und Stahlhelm ins Wasser und schwimmen ans Land. Ich habe noch das Gefühl, dass es doch wohl etwas viel Aufwand für meine kleine Verletzung am Knie sei. (108 words)

Ich sehe Herrn P. dort sitzen, der zu diesen gehört. - Ich frage Eberhard: Was willst du gerade mit dieser? Er sagt oder deutet an, er habe sie zum Theologen-Fest eingeladen. Er hat irgendwelche diplomatischen Gründe dafür. Ich suche Margund. Schliesslich finde ich sie. Sie sagt schon im voraus zu allem, was ich mir ihr verabreden will: Ich habe keine Zeit: Mittwoch nicht, Donnerstag nicht, Freitag nicht, - - und Sonnabend in acht Tagen fahre ich vielleicht nach Hause. Ich sage sehr leise, damit es die anderen nicht hören: "Da ist aber das Theologen-Fest. "- Sie: "ja, das weiss ich noch nicht." Ich: Aber dann sagen Sie mir es bitte bald, sehr bald, sonst bin ich aufgeschmissen. Ich will sagen: dann gehe ich mit jemand anderem hin, verbessere mich aber in Gedanken schnell und sage: dann gehe ich auch nicht hin. - Ich schaue auf den Ausdruck der Augen während des Gespräches. Sie haben etwas Spontanes und doch zugleich Kühles. (202 words)

Ich merke aus seiner Schilderung gleich, dass es nichts taugt, und mache die Einwende, die ich schon schriftlich gemacht habe. Ich könne mir nur das Zimmer undverbindlich mal ansehen. Zum Schluss sage ich ihm: "Nun habe ich Ihren Namen schon wieder vergessen." Er antwortet: "Jetzt sage ich ihn nicht noch mal". Ich rate noch etwas herum.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0024 (1949-03-04 - Göttingen)Ich gehe auf einem Abendspaziergang den Nikolausberger-Weg hinunter; an der Strassenecke begegnen mir Fräulein Höhndorf und Fräulein Siem. Sie gehen auch spazieren. Fräulein Höhndorf tritt gleich auf mich zu; in ihrer energisch hilfsbereiten Art redet sie mich gleich an. Fräulein Siem steht ruhig und noch zurückhaltend daneben, gibt dem Gespräch nur durch einige kleine, manchmal scharfe Bemerkungen lächelnd ihre Note. Höhndorf fragt irgend etwas, ob ich auch meinen Spaziergang mache, und ich antworte entsprechend, wie schön das ist, und sage wohl auch irgend etwas von Sport und Schwimmen. Den näheren Inhalt unserer Sätze habe ich jetzt vergessen. - Aber Fräulein Siems kleine Bemerkung habe ich nicht vergessen. Sie sagt bloss: "Ich schwimme aber nicht gleich bis zum Stadtbad und zurück". - Dann gehen wir jeder in seiner Richtung weiter und ich biege in die Hanssen-Strasse ein. Als ich noch nicht weit gegangen bin, höre ich hinten einige polternde Schritte und wie Fräulein Siem und Fräulein Höhndorf jemand anders begrüssen. Ich denke, dass könnte Krischan (Christian) sein. Bald kommen denn auch die Schritte kräftig hinter mir her und ich gehe langsam und verhalten, um abzuwarten. Als er mir begegnet, sagt Krischan:"Ho!, schon meilenweit kann man Dich an Deinem Gang erkennen -", und ich schon im selben Atemzug:"Als ich dahinten die polternden Schritte hörte, wusste ich schon, dass du es sein musstest". - Das war also die erste Begegnung nach längerem Getrenntsein. Dann gingen wir nebeneinander her und es entstand eine Pause. Ich dachte schon halb im Erwachen - 'ach, hättest du den Brief noch nicht abgeschickt, wo die Papiere drin sind, die Krischan jetzt braucht;' und dann fiel mir ein 'Ach ich hab ihn ja noch in der Tasche'.

Ich hatte die Augen im Gehen geschlossen und, als ich sie aufmache, merke ich, dass ich unmittelbar vor einer grossen, rechteckigen Öffnung im Boden stehe, an deren dunkelm Grund ich elektrische Schaltanlagen sehe - offenbar irgendeine unterirdische Anlage, ähnlich wie die Kanalisationen von oben zugänglich, deren Deckel man geöffnet hatte. - Mein erster Gedanke ist, dass es irgendein, auf der Strasse spielendes Kind sein müsse, das mich im letzten Augenblick festgehalten hat -. - Im Erwachen merke ich, dass ich auf meinem Bett liege und jemand neben mir liegt, der meine Rechte gefasst hält. Ich wage nicht, mich umzusehen und will fragen: "Wer ist da?", aber die Stimme versagt mir und ich drücke nur fest die fremde Hand. Als ich die Augen gewaltsam aufreisse, sehe ich -: das schwarze Loch, über dem ich stand, ist die dunkle Seitenwand eines Schrankes, die sich senkrecht am Fussende meines Bettes aufrichtet. Die ganze Lage war also in dem Traum um 90 Grad gedeht: Der senkrechte Schrank: waagerecht. Meine waagerechte Lage mit geschlossenen Augen: ein aufrechtes Gehen mit geschlossenen Augen. Das helle Bild an der Wand des dunklen Schrankes waren die elektrischen Geräte in dem dunklen Loch. Die Hand, die meine Rechte fest gefasst hielt, war meine eigene Linke, die im Schlaf in der Rechten gelegen hatte und die ich im Erwachen, in der Meinung, es sei die Hand eines Unbekannten, neben mir Liegenden, ganz fest gedrückt hatte. Ich lag nach diesem Erwachen noch eine Zeitlang wie gelähmt auf dem Bett, auf das ich mich zu einem kurzen Nachmittagsschlaf gelegt hatte. Das Beängstigende in diesem Traum lag darin, dass auch im Erwachen seine Realität nicht aufhörte. (294 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0026 (1949-03-06 - Göttingen)Auf einem Platz in der Stadt. Es sind mehrere Autounfälle passiert. In welche Richtung ich auch schaue, liegen die Leichen der Verunglückten, schrecklich entstellt. Ich will mich zwingen, nicht wegzusehen, denn ich habe den Gedanken, das Ertragen solchen Anblicks lernen zu müssen, denn es könnten ja auch einmal solche Menschen nur verletzt sein und ich ihnen helfen müssen. Aber ich halte es nicht mehr aus und ergreife die Flucht. - - Ich komme mit einem Gerichtsmediziner in ein Institut, wo die Köpfe der Verunglückten ausgestellt sind. Wir betrachten den Kopf eines Mannes, dessen Unfall mit einer von ihm verübten verbrecherischen Tat zusammenhängt. Er sieht merkwürdig frisch aus. Wie ich mich auch stelle, werfe ich Schatten auf den Kopf, da das Licht von mehreren Lampen kommt. Endlich bin ich so zurückgetreten, dass der Kopf frei beleuchtet ist, und mein Begleiter ihn richtig betrachten kann. Er misst die Gesichtsproportionen mit der Handspanne. Der Kopf ist am Halse abgehackt und auf einem kleinen Sockel befestigt. Ich merke, wie der Mund sich bewegt. Ich sage:"Einen merkwürdigen Ausdruck hat der Mann. So trübe und irgendwie gleichgültig. - Die Augen sind ja überhaupt offen!" Da merke ich, wie die Augen sich bewegen und mich gross anschauen. Mir wird schwindlig. Ich sage zu Emmi, die auch im Raum steht, und meinem Begleiter, der inzwischen Vaters Züge angenommen hat:"Mir ist nicht gut. Ich möchte rausgehen, aber bleibt bitte ruhig drin und lasst Euch nicht stören". Sie begleiten mich sofort nach draussen ins Freie. Ich sage, dass ich nun per Anhalter über Berlin weiterfahren wollte zu meinem Wohnsitz in München. Aber sie sagen: "Du bleibst selbstverständlich hier" und wollen mich pflegen. Wir hatten schon vorher über diese Reise gesprochen, und ich hatte da gesagt: " Ich fahre auf keinem Fall per Auto bei dieser Glätte, bei der es so viele Unfälle gibt". Sie nehmen mich in ihre Hut und ich erwache. (312 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0027 (1949-03-08 - Göttingen)Ich fahre mit einem Pferdewagen durch einen Koppelweg. Rechts und links sind Zäune. Dann muss ich nach links einbiegen und über die Koppel durch eine Mulde, die unter Wasser steht. Vor mir sind noch zwei andere, ebenfalls zweispännige Kastenwagen. Links neben mir verschwindet der Zaun im Wasser. Der Knecht vor mir biegt ein. Ich lenke ebenfalls nach links und sage noch im letzten Moment "Halt", weil ich denke, die Pferde müssen sich im Zaun verfangen, aber es geht glatt weiter. Dann wird das Wasser immer tiefer und geht bis über die Köpfe der Pferde. Der Knecht vor mir sagt: "Bleib oben, mein Pferdchen", damit sich die Tiere im Wasser nicht hinlegen. Ich sage automatisch zu meinen Pferden das selbe. Ich bin im Wagen aufgestanden und ziehe die Zügel krampfhaft hoch. Dabei merke ich, dass sie sich verwirrt haben und muss erst suchen, dass ich die beiden richtigen Leinen richtig gefasst kriege. Die Pferde tauchen wieder aus dem Wasser auf und dann geht es befreiend bergauf. Wir müssen nun nach rechts über einen zweiten Koppelzaun, um aus dem Wasser herauszukommen. Der erste Wagen steht schon an der Durchgangsstelle. Weil die Pferde aus dem tiefen Wasser zu schnell bergauf gegangen sind, stehen die Wagen nun dicht nebeneinander. Der Knecht ruft mir zu:"Du musst weiter nach links halten." - Ich sehe noch das Bild, die sechs braunen Pferde ganz plastisch nebeneinander, die Unterkörper noch im Wasser. Ich sah sie von oben, weil ich noch in meinem Wagen aufrecht stand. - Dann wurde auch die zweite Durchfahrt aus der Koppel heraus überwunden und der Weg führte weiter geradeaus. (264 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0028 (1949-03-08 - Göttingen)Vater und Emmi (oder Mutti?) betrachten einen Pelzmantel und zählen, aus wieviel grösseren Fellstücken er zusammengenäht ist. Sie können sich aber nicht ganz über die Zahl einig werden. Für mich ist das Bild verwirrend, denn von innen ist der Mantel gefüttert mit lauter unendlich vielen ganz kleinen rechteckigen Pelzstückchen. - (50 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0029 (1949-03-08 - Göttingen)Gestern träumte ich: Ich bin auf der Reise. In München hat mir mein Schwager eine Nachricht hinterlassen, die auf ein Papier geschrieben ist, das in lauter schmale Streifen auseinandergeschnitten wurde, die ich nun wie ein Geduldsspiel mühsam nebeneinander halten muss, um sie zu entziffern. Sie enthalten Warnungen und Weisungen für die Weiterreise gen Osten. (54 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0030 (1949-03-09 - Göttingen)Ich gehe durch die Stadt. Vor einem grossen Warenhaus begegnet mir eine modisch gekleidete Frau mit schwarzen Haaren, die aussieht wie eine Pariserin. Sie drängt sich mir in furchtbarer Weise auf und verfolgt mich so, dass ich schliesslich die Flucht ergreife und in ein Haus laufe. Ich komme in ein Zimmer und schliesse in grosser Hast die Tür hinter mir zu. Nach dem ersten Umschliessen des Schlüssels ist die Tür noch offen, erst nach dem zweiten Mal ist sie endlich sicher verschlossen. Ich stehe drinnen in zitternder Angst. Ich bin in das Zimmer eines Mädchens gekommen. Nach einer Weile kommt ein Herr, der sehr verwundert ist, mich in dem Zimmer zu finden, bald darauf das Mädchen selber. Es beruhigt mich in liebevoller, fast mütterlicher Art, so dass ich wieder innerlich frei werde. Dann wandelt sich die Situation. Das Erlebnis verwandelt sich in der Erinnerung in einen Kampf mit Tigern, den ich ausführen musste in einem Film, in dem ich eine Rolle zu spielen hatte. Ich habe den Titel des Films vergessen und suchte nach ihm auf einem Reklameplakat, auf dem die Tiger abgebildet sind. - (185 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0031 (1949-03-10 - Göttingen)Ich bin ins Hallenschwimmbad gegangen, ohne eine Eintrittskarte zu haben, weil die Pförtnersfrau ein Auge zugedrückt hat. Drinnen sind nur zwei oder drei Menschen, die dort springen und schwimmen. Ich gehe die Treppe herauf zu den Umkleidekabinen, kann aber die richtige nicht finden. Erst als ich nach vorne aus einer Kabine geschaut habe, wo ich aufs Wasser sehen kann, bin ich wieder orientiert. - Die anderen Leute sind inzwischen fortgegangen und ich bin nun ganz alleine im Bad. Ich habe ein schlechtes Gewissen, dass ich so ohne Eintrittskarte hier bin. (90 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0032 (1949-03-10 - Göttingen)Ich gehe mit Krischan (Christian) über eine Brücke. Er hat eine Jungvolkuniform an. Ich sage zu ihm "Sie haben dich wohl sehr geschliffen". (23 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0033 (1949-03-11 - Göttingen)Ich bin mit Krischan (Christian) auf einem Reitplatz. Wir lernen dort reiten. Auch eine ältere Damen sehe ich beim Reiten. Dann kommt Christians Mutter. Wir reden ihr gut zu, auch mitzureiten, und sie tut es. Ich muss nun zugucken, weil ein Pferd zu wenig ist. Wir sind eine kleine Treppe hochgegangen, die von unten, wie eine Kellertreppe, auf den Platz führt. Auf der stehe ich nun und muss mich vorsehen, dass mir die Pferde nicht von oben auf den Kopf treten. Dann kommt irgendeine Übung, die nur alle die mitreiten dürfen, die Stuten haben. Der Reitplatz ist mit Rasen bewachsen und liegt inmitten von grünen Koppeln, von denen er durch einen einfachen Koppelzaun getrennt ist. Die Pferde werden nun in eine der Nachbarkoppeln gelassen. Dort gehen auch die anderen alle hin. Nur der Reitlehrer und ich bleiben auf dem Platz zurück. Mit einem Mal kommt das Schönste der Pferde von weitem angaloppiert, um über das Tor in die Reitbahn zurückzuspringen. Dabei verfängt es sich und bleibt mit beiden Hinterbeinen im Tor hängen. Von drüben rufen alle entsetzt "das Tor, das Tor". Der Reitlehrer entfernt vorsichtig die eine Stange - ich denke noch einen Moment, ob ich ihm helfen soll, habe dann aber das Gefühl, dass ich dabei nur im Wege wäre. - Das Pferd befreit sich langsam. Es ist völlig in Schweiss gebadet - aber es bewegt sich mit ruhigen Schritten weiter. Alles atmet befreit auf. Dann geht das Tier zur anderen Seite der Bahn, um dort schon wieder über den Zaun zu springen, weil dort jenseits auf der Koppel eine grosse, wollige Schafherde weidet. Aber der Reitlehrer macht schnell einen lockenden Ruf, so dass die ganze Schafherde herankommt und das Pferd nicht über den Zaun zu springen braucht. Nun werden auch die anderen Pferde hereingelassen und stehen alle am Zaun bei den Schafen. Da kommt von Ferne auf der anderen Koppel eine Kuhherde heran und Gisela sagt: "Wie schade, dass wir die nicht auch noch hereinlassen können". Sie stellt sich das so vor, wie in dem paradiesischen Endzustand bei Jesaja, wo alle Tiere friedlich beieinander sind. 

- Ich darf nun noch ein besonders schönes Pferd aussuchen, um noch einmal zu reiten, weil ich vorhin zu kurz gekommen bin. Im Galoppieren wache ich allmählich auf, aber beschäftige mich im Halbwachen noch eine Weile mit dem Reiten. (386 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0034 (1949-03-12 - Göttingen)Physiologieunterricht bei einem berühmten Professor, dessen Namen ich nicht behalten kann. Er geht mit uns im Schlossgarten spazieren. Dort ist ein neuer Gärtner. Endlich ist der Rasen wieder richtig gepflegt. Dann lehnen wir an dem Geländer an einer Brücke. Es sind jetzt ausser mir nur noch zwei Studenten bei dem Professor. Er malt dem einen mit seinem Federhalter blaue Striche und Figuren auf seinen Anzug, so dass der bald sehr lustig aussieht: Ich denke, das ist eigentlich doch etwas merkwürdig, - aber als Physiologie muss der Mann ja wissen, ob man so etwas wieder abkriegt. Inzwischen begegnet uns Professor Pohl. Mein Lehrer redet ihn mit Namen an, aber sein eigener Name fällt leider nicht im Gespräch. - 

Der eine Student ist fortgegangen in den Schlossgarten. Wir gehen hinterher. Er geht dort auf den Rasen, um sich einen vom Baum gefallenen Apfel zu holen. Aber der neue Gärtner hält sich einen Hund, der nun sofort auf den Delinquenten loskommt. Dieser wirft den Apfel vor Schreck in die Luft, dass er mir vor die Füsse fällt. Der Hund denkt, ich bin's gewesen, und will mich in die Hand beissen. Ich halte ihm krampfhaft die Kinnladen auseinander. So geht es eine ganze Weile. Niemand kommt mir zu Hilfe. Ich schaue dem Hund in die Augen, aber der ist nur darauf aus, mich zu beissen. Ich rufe alle Leute um Hilfe an und bitte sie, den Gärtner zu holen, damit er seinen Hund von mir abrufen kann. Aber die zucken alle nur mit den Achseln. Es geht sie nichts an. - Als ich die Zähne des Hundes, die sich schon tief in meine Finger eingebohrt haben, beinahe nicht mehr auseinanderhalten kann und schon die Hoffnung aufgebe, wache ich auf.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0035 (1949-03-13 - Göttingen)Ich bin in einem Blumengarten von Stauden und blühenden Rosenstöcken, deren Namen ich nennen soll. Beim ersten Mal gelingt mir das gar nicht, als ich jedoch näher zusehe, und jede einzeln betaste, ob sie Dornen hat, und an jeder rieche, kann ich sie alle richtig benennen. Es sind auch unechte Rosen darunter, die jedesmal, wenn ich an ihnen rieche, eine Enttäuschung sind. (Es geht übrigens nicht darum, die Rosensorten einzeln zu unterscheiden, sondern nur festzustellen, ob es eine Rose ist, oder, wenn es eine Staude ist, wie sie heisst). (89 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0036 (1949-03-13 - Göttingen)Ich gehe durch die Strasse. Plötzlich kommt mir ein Traberwagen entgegen. Er fährt so schnell, dass man ihn nur unscharf erkennen kann. Während ich ihm noch nachschaue, kommt schon ein zweiter und ich begreife, dass es sich hier um ein Rennen handelt. Da kommt dazwischen ein Lastauto in grossem Tempo. Ich fürchte einen Zusammenstoss. Dann höre ich die Kinder "Ari, Ari" schreien. (d.h. Artillerie). Ich meine, die Umrisse von Protze und Geschütz wahrnemen zu können. Dann rufen die Kinder "Da kommt die Preussische Wehrmacht mit einer Fahne". Das ist etwas unerhörtes in dieser Zeit und klingt wie ein Fanfarenruf. (Im Erwachen höre ich draussen Kinder rufen. Ich liege auf meinem Bett und habe doch das Gefühl, nun zu sitzen. Es ist alles noch wie in der Schwebe und ich muss mir erst einen Stoss geben, aufzustehen. Auch die Bilder des Traums haben noch diese allgemeine Vieldeutigkeit und erst eine scharf erinnernde Besinnung bringt sie in feste Umrisse.) (157 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0037 (1949-03-14 - Göttingen)Ich sitze mit Professor von Rad und seiner Frau und Kind auf einer Schwebebahn, die nur aus einem einzigen Brett besteht, das frei an einem Seil hängt. Das Seil ist neben uns an einem Kirchturm befestigt. Sie sagen mir entsetzt, dass ich reitend auf dem Brett sitzen müsse und nicht im gewöhnlichen Sitz. Da bewegt sich das Brett schon und ich kann mich nur mit äusserster Mühe halten. Emmi sitzt auch mit auf dem Brett und stürzt beinahe ab. Wir hängen alle mit den Köpfen nach unten. Ich muss sie halten. - Szenenwechsel: Von der Bahn ist jetzt nur noch ein Seil übrig geblieben. Ich bin mit einem Kameraden hinaufgeklettert und wir hängen unmittelbar unterhalb der Brüstung des Turmes. Es entspinnt sich folgendes Gespräch: "Früher führte zu jedem Turm ein solcher Aufzug hinauf", sagt mein Partner. "Im Michel ist noch heute ein solcher", ist meine Antwort. - Er: "Heute unterhält man sie nicht mehr. Sie sind überall verfallen. Dieser Strick ist noch das Überbleibsel davon." - Wir hängen immer noch an dem Seil. Ich kann mich kaum mehr halten. Wir haben eine Kinderleiche bei uns und fragen die Pförtnersfrau, ob sie sie annehmen will. Mein Freund belehrt mich, der ich es nicht glauben will, wie viel dies noch vorkommt, wie viele Kinder von ihren Müttern ums Leben gebracht werden. - Die Frau fragt: "Ist es das erste Kind?" Ich weiss mit unfehlbarer Sicherheit, dass sie es nehmen wird, denn es ist das erste Kind. Diese Sitte, wenigstens ein Kind nicht unbegragen zu lassen, entspricht einer alten, in ihrer Klarheit durchsichtigen religiösen Gewohnheit. Ich kann mich kaum mehr halten und möchte sie zu einer schnellen Entscheidung drängen, aber die Sorge um das Kind verbietet es mir, obwohl ich beinahe abstürzen muss. Nach kurzer Besinnung beantwortet die Frau unsere Frage mit den Worten: "Geben Sie es her" und wir schwingen das Paket über die Brüstung. Ich wundere mich, dass alle anderen Geschwister eines solchen Kindes aus ärmster und verkommener Familie dann unbegraben bleiben werden, und erschaudere von dieser grausigen Konsequenz. - Szenenwechsel: Ich bin in einer Irrenanstalt, meine Cousine ist dort als Pflegerin und hat einige Patienten irgendwo hin zu bringen. Ein Mann sitzt rückwärts auf einem Rollstuhl und wird gezogen. Er aber will sich selber helfen, springt runter und versucht, indem er rückwärts geht, den Stuhl mitzuschieben. Als ihm das nicht gelingt, denn der Stuhl läuft immer schneller, rast er in irrem Tempo rückwärts weiter hinterher, bis er aus der Bahn gerät, in die Irre torkelt und mich dabei zu überrennen droht. Ich weiche entsetzt zur Seite. - Wir begleiten jetzt ein schwachsinniges Mädchen. Es hat einen Teller in der Hand, den es mit dem Druck der Finger zu Scherben zerbricht. Ich habe grosse Angst, dabei verletzt zu werden, aber ich lege ihr die Hand auf die Schulter und versuche, ihr zu helfen. Wir sitzen auf einer Böschung am Rande der Anstalt. Nun soll der Weg beginnen. Sie will sofort quer über die Strasse und ins Wasser gehen, denn auf der anderen Seite ist ein See. Es gelingt mir, sie von der besseren Richtung zu überzeugen. Nur bin ich ihr dabei so nahe gekommen, dass ich mich nun kaum von ihr lösen kann. Sie will mich umarmen und nur mit äusserster Gewalt kann ich mich befreien. (Es ist die selbe Situation wie bei dem Traum mit der Pariserin, nur mit einer Note tieferen Mitleidens.) Die Szene wechselt: Ich gehe durch eine enge Gasse. Jetzt sind es Pferde, die mich bedrängen. Diese Szene hat sich unmittelbar aus der vorigen ergeben. Sie kommen in beängstigender Enge von hinten an mir vorbei. Mehrmals hintereinander. Dann zwei Gefährte, von entgegengesetzter Seite zu gleicher Zeit, die sich in dieser Enge nie begegnen können. Ich stelle mich dem einen Gespann entgegen. Aber sie können beide ihre Geschwindigkeit nicht mehr bremsen und prasseln aufeinander. Ich springe im letzten Moment auf die Schwelle einer Haustür und fasse an die Klinke. Die Tür ist verschlossen. Ich drücke eine Klingel, die ich dort entdecken, mit dem Schild: "für sowieso mittlere Klingel benützen", obgleich nur eine Klingel dort ist. Ich höre kein Klingelzeichen nach hier draussen dringen. Ich bin nun in äusserster Bedrängnis, denn jeden Moment kann eins der Pferde mit den Hufen nach mir ausschlagen. (Im Erwachen variiert sich der Gadanke folgendermassen: Ein Mann kommt mit seinem Fuhrwerk von hinten und kann nicht an mir vorbeifahren, denn er weiss, dass seine Pferde schlagen werden. Aber er wartet diszipliniert, bis ich in das Haus eingelassen werde. Mein nächster Gedanke ist: Du hast wieder von Pferden geträumt, dann eröffnen sich wie neue Perspektiven nacheinander rückwärts: zunächst der vorhergehende Abschnitt des Traums, dann alle weiteren in einer unbestimmten, dämmerhaften Ferne und ich weiss, dass er auch noch weiter zurückreicht, als ich ihn jetzt verfolgt habe. (Ich war mit meinem Bruder in einem Gemeindesaal und wollte einen Turm besteigen, vor dem er aber Angst hatte.) Dann springe ich auf und schalte das Licht ein. In diesem Augenblick brauche ich eine gewaltsame Konzentration, um nicht alle Bilder zu vergessen. Einzelne Gespräche und Gedanken muss ich nachträglich fast rekonstruieren.) (842 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0038 (1949-03-16 - Göttingen)Nicolai Hartmann soll einen Vortrag halten. Der Saal ist ungeheuer überfüllt und die Luft kaum erträglich. Er kommt sehr langsam herein und sagt einige leise Worte, dass man in einen andern Saal gehen könnte. Als noch alles durcheinander redet, ruft er ihnen mit lauter Stimme zu: "Guten Morgen, meine Herren" und erklärt dann noch einmal, man solle unauffällig und in kleinen Grüppchen in den anderen Saal gehen - möglichst auf verschiedenen Wegen. Es ist nämlich Krieg. Draussen ist es finster. Ich bin völlig desorientiert und rufe einen anderen Menschen an, er möge mich mitnehmen, ich sei nachtblind. In dem anderen Saal ist ein ziemliches Durcheinander. Ich habe eine Tasche, die ich in dem laubenartigen Vorderbau zu verstecken suche, obwohl sie mir nicht gehört. - Später, auf einem Marsch, fragt mich der Besitzer der Tasche nach ihr. Wir müssen uns nun - wieder des nachts - auf den Weg machen, in das kleine Dorf, in dem der Saal gelegen war, um die Tasche zu suchen. Die Häuser sehen in der Dämmerung einander sehr ähnlich. Darum steure ich zunächst auf ein falsches zu, an dem ich einen laubenartigen Vorbau erblickt habe. Die Einwohner treten uns entgegen und sind sehr misstrauisch und hinterhältig. Wir sind in einer Partisanengegend. Auf dem Weg, der uns nun in das gesuchte Gebäude führen soll, treten uns wieder Einheimische entgegen und versuchen, uns hinzuhalten. Mein Partner kehrt um, um sein Gewehr zu holen. Auf dem Rückweg wendet er sich noch einmal und macht eine wurfartige Bewegung, als ob er eine Handgranate werfen wolle, auf mich und die Leute zu. Neben uns explodieren kleine Böhnchen, die den Leuten grossen Eindruck machen, die ich aber sofort als völlig ungefährlich erkenne. - Als er zurückkommt, das Gewehr umgehängt, sage ich: "Kannst du überhaupt schiessen, die Feder zu deinem Gewehr ist doch in der Tasche, die wir suchen?" Er bestätigt meine Befürchtung und wir machen uns nun mit unserem zweifelhaften Schutz weiter auf die Suche. (323 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0039 (1949-03-17 - Göttingen)Ich klettere einen langen, gleichmässig ansteigenden grünen Berghang hinan und denke dabei, dass er sich sehr gut zur Verteidigung eignen müsse, da er von oben bis unten übersichtlich ist. Oben auf dem Kamm will ich eine Verteidigungsstellung einrichten... Wir haben einen Gefangenen gemacht. Nun ist die Frage, ob wir ihn mitnehmen sollen, oder eine deutsche Frau. Für beide ist nicht Platz. Wenn er zurückbleibt, werden ihn seine Landsleute ums Leben bringen. Der Frau dagegen, weil sie keine militärische Person ist, wird nichts passieren. Ich rate darum, den Gefangenen mitzunehmen, weil jedes Menschenleben gerettet werden muss... Gefangene in einem Eisenbahnwagen. Ich steige ein, um Schlipse an sie zu verteilen. Für jeden ist einer da - nur für einen ein Ball. Diesen bekommt einer, der mich besonders darum bittet. Einen Augenblick ist es nicht ganz klar, ob für jeden etwas da sein wird. Da tritt einer freiwillig zurück. - Ich gebe ihm - schon im Aussteigen - einen Kuss auf die Stirn. Er hat sich in diesem Moment in ein Mädchen verwandelt (aber in der Weise, wie so oft im Traum, dass ich dies nicht weiter merke, sondern es mir erst jetzt auffällt). Ich gehe nun in den Nachbar-Raum, in dem die Schwestern sitzen. Dort werde ich genötigt, neben Bille zu sitzen. Das überrascht und erfreut mich. An der Stirnwand des Raumes sitzt Mölöchen. Sie hat ihr Bein hochgelegt, denn es ist irgendwie krank - aber sie ist zufrieden und glücklich, denn sie freut sich, dass ihre Kinder ein Fest nebenan feiern. (In diese Situation hat sich inzwischen die Traumszene gewandelt). Nun kommt eine Schwester in den Raum, um bei uns allen die Temperatur zu messen. Von meinem Thermometer liest sie ab, dass ich 37,4 1/4 Grad Fieber habe. Sie ist sehr besorgt und erkundigt sich, woher das komme. Ich sage ihr, dass es wohl nur mein akuter Schnupfen sei. 

Zweiter Traum: Ich bin mit Margund und Gisela zusammen. Da wir alle die Hooverspeisung essen, überrede ich sie, beide zusammen mit mir in die Mensa zu kommen, nachdem ich ihre Einwände wegen Zeitmangel usw. in den Wind geschlagen habe.

Dritter Traum: Aus einer Toreinfahrt kommt mir eine Einspännerfuhre entgegen. Der Kutscher ist nicht bei seinem Wagen und ich versuche, das Pferd aufzuhalten. Das gelingt mir kaum. Es tritt mit dem Vorderbein nach mir, wie es nur sehr böswillige Tiere tun. Ich habe mich an das Pferd geklammert und weiss nicht, wie ich nun loskommen soll, ohne getreten zu werden. Endlich gelingt es mir, das Pferd an einen Baum anzubinden, nachdem ich es vom Wagen abgespannt habe. Der Knecht, der nun hinzugekommen ist, nimmt kaum Notiz von dem. (435 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0040 (1949-03-18 - Göttingen)Ich bin mit Vater unterwegs mit zwei Geschützen, auf denen man sitzt wie auf einem Fahrrad und die mit Hilfe von Pedalen angetrieben werden. Vater fährt auf dem vorderen, an das das meine mit einem Seil angehängt ist. Es geht durch einen sandigen Weg und er muss sehr treten. Ich sage, dass ich absteigen wolle, denn seine Pedale haben eine Übersetzung und meine nicht, so dass er die ganze Arbeit leisten muss. Aber er sagt, es sei nicht nötig, ich solle sitzen bleiben. Dann geht es einen langen Sandweg bergab, den entlang wir hintereinander her sausen auf einer schmalen, festeren Spur, die sich durch den weicheren Sand hindurch schlängelt und die nicht zu verfehlen, man sich sehr konzentrieren muss. Jedoch verleiht diese Anspannung bei höchster Geschwindigkeit ein Gefühl grosser Befriedigung. Am Ende des Weges landen wir in dem Keller eines Hauses. Vater weiss, dass wir uns nun nach rechts halten müssen, während ich, völlig desorientiert, gerade die entgegengesetzte Richtung gegangen wäre. Aber nach rechts führen alle Türen nur in geschlossene Kellergelasse und ich schlage vor, einen langen Gang zu gehen, der nach links ins Freie führt. Draussen könne man dann bequem ums Haus herum gehen. Vater ist das nicht sympathisch und ich schliesse daraus, dass wohl Krieg sein müsse und zur linken sich die feindliche Front befindet. Als wir dann diesen Ausgang gewählt haben, eröffnet sich nach rechts draussen eine breite Strasse. Jedoch geht diese bald in einen tiefen Einschnitt über, durch den sie in ganzer Breite und mit senkrechten Wänden in den Fels gehauen ist. Oben sind grosse Querbalken über die Öffnung gelegt, über die hin eine Masse von Menschen sich bewegt, die grosse, schwere Steinbrocken auf die Strasse herunter wälzt. Es handelt sich offensichtlich um einen Strassenbau, der in seiner Aufmachung mit der Verwendung grosser Sklavenmengen und der Verwertung ganz elementaren Materials an ein antikes Unternehmen erinnert. Vater läuft schnell hindurch und ist bald vor der langsam vorschreitenden Welle der Arbeitenden über ihm und damit ausserhalb der Gefahrenzone. Jedesmal aber, wenn ich vorlaufen will, werden gerade vor mir schwere Steine hinabgeworfen, so viel ich auch rufen und für einen Augenblick um freie Bahn bitten mag. Schliesslich fasse ich mir ein Herz, doch hindurchzulaufen. Doch schon nach wenigen Schritten werde ich von einem Stein an der Seite getroffen, taumle zurück und setze mich an die Böschung. Als ich mich erholt habe, klettere ich die hohe Böschungswand hinauf, um nun oben neben diesem tiefen Einschnitt zu gehen. Oben sehe ich zur Linken die Hütten eines Dorfes liegen. Vor mir, am Ende der versenkten Strasse, dehnt sich das Meer. Dort steht mein Vater am Ausgang des Strassenschachtes, wo er in eine Steilküste am Meer mündet. Er will gerade umkehren, um nach mir zu schauen, und nur, indem ich mich flach auf den Bauch auf den Rand des Einschnittes lege, um ihm zuzurufen, kann ich ihn hindern, sich noch einmal in die Gefahrenzone zurückzubegeben. (Hier folgt im Handschrifttext eine Zeichnung, die die Szene darstellt). 

Dann Szenenwechsel. Vater ist gestorben und drinnen, das heisst, in dem Raum, den vorher dieser Schacht bildete, aufgebart. Ich sitze draussen mit Gisela vor der Tür. Es kommen eine Menge Leute, ihn zu sehen, darunter auch die Wirtin, eine kleine, neugierige und etwas aufdringliche, kupplerische Frau. Nach einer Zeit kommt Onkel Adolf. Ich stehe auf und muss mich gewaltsam zwingen, ein ernstes, trauriges Gesicht zu machen, denn all die vielen Besuche und Beileidswünsche haben mich längst zum Lächeln gebracht. (571 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0041 (1949-03-19 - Göttingen)Ich beginne mit einem Auto abzufahren, während ich noch hinten sitze und von dort vornübergebeugt steure um dann in der Fahrt nach vorne überzusteigen. Doch als der Wagen sich in Bewegung setzt, ist die Strasse schon voller Menschen, Frauen, Mädchen, Kinder, die ich rettungslos überfahren müsste. Darum trete ich noch im Stehen von hinten mit äusserster Gewalt auf den Hebel, den ich als Bremse erkenne, und kann den Wagen dadurch immer gerade so weit bremsen, dass ein Anfahren der Passanten im letzten Moment vermieden wird, jedoch nie ihn völlig zum Stehen bringen. Als ich endlich ganz vorne sitze, droht der Wagen jedoch im Gewühl allmählich stehen zu bleiben. Ich suche nun nach dem Gashebel und nehme das Steuer fest in die Hand, um endlich sicherer meinen Weg finden zu können. Das ganze war in der Theaterstrasse. 

Zweite Traumszene: Auf dem Theaterplatz ein Reiter. Haltung und Sitz sind vorbildlich. Das Pferd ist ein edles Tier. Dem Auge ist alles eine Freude. Doch plötzlich verliert er die Gewalt über sein Tier, obwohl seine Haltung nichts an Vorbildlichkeit verliert. Es droht ihn so nahe an der grossen, vierarmigen Barocklampe, die mitten auf dem Platz steht, vorbeizuführen, dass er an ihrem Pfeiler das linke Knie zerschlagen muss. Dann ein Ausfall nach rechts. Im Galopp auf mich zu. Ich springe entsetzt neben mir die kleine Böschung hoch, komme zu Fall und wälze mich noch im letzten Moment hinter den Baum, der dort steht. Dann gehen die Hufe neben mir vorüber.

Dritte Traumszene: Ich stehe bei Gisela vor der Etagentür der Wohnung, nachdem ich vorher schon festgestellt habe, dass sie nicht in ihrem Zimmer ist. Da kommt Herr J. (Rudolf Jentzsch) die Treppe herauf. Er hat nur ein Bein wie ein Kriegsversehrter und hüpft mit bewundernswerter Leichtigkeit die Stufen hinauf. Oben angekommen breitet er begrüssend die Arme aus und legt sich zurück wie ein Skifahrer. Auch trägt er eine weisse Skibluse. Ich habe grosse Angst, dass er in dieser Haltung das Gleichgewicht verlieren und die Treppe hinunterstürzen muss. Ich sage ihm, dass Fräulein W. nicht da sei. Überdem kommt noch ein dritter Herr die Treppe hinauf, den ich nur dunkel erinnere und der mir irgendwie unheimlich ist. (361 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0042 (1949-03-20 - Göttingen)Der war so schön, der Traum. Ich war mit L.S. (Lina Schmedeke) zu Hause. Sie war erfüllt von einer grossen, ganz natürlichen Heiterkeit. Wir kochten zusammen etwas in der Küche. Und wir waren eben beide ganz da - ohne Kummer, ohne Sehnsucht - so wie man nur dann da ist, wenn man sich ganz im Leben zu Hause fühlt. Diese Heiterkeit war bei ihr um so beglückender, als sie sonst leicht etwas Aschenputtelhaftes - vom Schicksal bedrücktes - hatte. Manchmal aber kam von innen heraus eine grosse innere Kindlichkeit und Selbstverständlichkeit, die so glücklich macht, weil wir uns ganz bei ihr geborgen fühlen. So war es hier im Traum - obgleich schlechterdings gar nichts geschah - es war nur diese Heiterkeit, die wie eine Glocke läutete. Es mag vieles zusammengekommen sein, diesen Traum zu erzeugen. Die Schneeglöckchen, die auf meinem Schreibtisch standen, erinnerten mich an ein kleines Bild, das sie gezeichnet hatte, in dem diese Heiterkeit ganz da ist. Dieses Bild liegt in den "Marmorklippen" an der Stelle, wo Jünger von dem Kloster der Falcifera spricht, "welches ganz im heiteren Stile erbaut" sei. - Es ist meist nur eine Bewegung, eine Gebärde, die ganz von innen heraus geschah, die solche Heiterkeit erzeugt, solche Brücken schlägt. - Darum sind Barock und Rokoko der heitere Stil, denn über ihnen liegt diese heitere Sicherheit, diese Serenitas, die die Fürsten jener Zeit zu repräsentieren hatten. Ich werde nie vergessen, wie mir einmal bei einem Menuett ein Arm entgegenkam, eine ausgestreckte Hand gereicht wurde in einer überzeugenden und doch überraschenden Sicherheit, die solche Gebärde als platisches Bild vor unserem inneren Auge stehen lässt wie die angehaltene Bewegtheit einer in Stein gehauenen Figur, bis sie in unseren Träumen wiederkehrt und uns Symbol wird für jene Heiterkeit, die jenseits aller Konflikte steht und uns zum idealen Sein wird, welches nicht nur ein Gebilde unserer Sehnsucht ist, sondern ein fester Grund, der bergend hinter unserem Wechsel steht. 

Zweiter Traum: Dann träumte ich wieder - wie gestern - von einem Kriegsversehrten auf einem Bein. Er ging auf zwei Krücken, jedoch mit einer gewissen sportlichen Eleganz. Da es aber durch Nässe sehr glatt war, drohte er das Gleichgewicht zu verlieren, und machte als Ausgleichsbewegung einige Schritte rückwärts. Dann fiel er aber doch hin, stand aber sofort wieder auf. Bald darauf kam er das zweite Mal ins Wanken. Als er wieder einige Schritte rückwärts machte, kam ein Auto von vorne und fuhr ganz dicht an ihm vorbei. Ich schaute oben aus dem Fenster und sah, dass es ihn überfahren würde, wenn er jetzt das Gleichgewicht verlöre. Aber er fiel nicht, blieb nur erschöpft stehen. Ich rief ihm von oben zu, er solle warten, ich wolle ihn begleiten. Nun musste ich erst meine Kleider wechseln und mir Schuhe anziehen, doch alles, was ich anzog, passte nicht zusammen, so dass es endlos lange dauerte und ich fürchte, er hat sehr warten müssen. Auch überlegte ich mir noch sehr, ob ich meinen Pelzmantel anziehen sollte, oder den Mantel mit dem Samtkragen, denn es konnte ja sein, dass es nicht günstig sei, in einem besetzten Land Kleider zu tragen, durch die man als Bourgeois auffiel - doch sträubte ich mich dagegen und wollte sie nun gerade anziehen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0043 (1949-03-21 - Göttingen)Es war in Muttis letzten Lebenstagen und ich sollte zu ihrer Pflege in die Berge fahren, wohin sie zur Erholung geschickt war. Vater war um mich und meine Reise sehr besorgt. Ich wollte per Anhalter fahren, wollte deshalb aber so wenig mitnehmen wie möglich und hatte mir auch zum Ideal gesetzt, bis zum letzten Moment vor der Abreise so meinen Tageslauf zu gehen wie immer. Ich hatte einige sehr schöne bronzene Gegenstände geerbt oder geschenkt bekommen, von denen Vater zwei ganz blank geputzt hatte. Ich mochte sie aber lieber so, wie sie waren, in einer Mischung von Glanz und Dunkelheit. Sie stammten von meinem Onkel, von dem ich auch eine Photographie hatte, die auf einem Familientreffen gemacht war. Vater war auch darauf - aber schon ganz von seiner letzten Krankheit und vom nahe bevorstehenden Tode gezeichnet. Wie denn überhaupt die Traumsituation dadurch merkwürdig gezeichnet war, dass sowohl Vater als Mutti kurz vor ihrem Tode standen, weshalb die innere Spannung, die Einstellung des Traums auf beide tendierte. Der Traum hatte sozusagen eine doppelten Skopus. Vor meiner Abreise liess ich noch schnell in einem Geschäft einige Photographien entwickeln, die ich gemacht hatte. Sie enttäuschten mich aber, denn sie waren unscharf, oder vielmehr, die Gegenstände waren zu klein und in die Ferne gerückt. Sie zeigten Szenen von einer Reitjagd, aber beim näheren Zusehen konnte man Reiter und Pferde wohl im Hintergrund entdecken. (229 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0044 (1949-03-26 - Göttingen)Ich gehe auf einer geraden, sonnigen Strasse den Berg hinan. Rechts und links sind schöne Tannen, in deren Schatten ein leiser Dunst über der Erde liegt, dann wieder liegt die Strasse streckenweise frei im Sonnenlicht. Von oben kommt mir ein Auto entgegen - es ist ein Volkswagen, wie sie jetzt alle Strassen bevölkern - und fährt direkt auf mich zu, weil ich mitten auf der Strasse gehe. Ich weiche nach rechts aus, er folgt mir nach rechts, ich weiche nach links aus, er folgt mir links. So merke ich bald, dass er mich nur erziehen will, weil ich ein "Verkehrssünder" bin. Der Spass gefällt mir. Schliesslich kommt er so nahe an mich ran, dass mir nichts anderes übrig bleibt, als auf den Kühler zu klettern und über das Auto herüber zu kriechen, um hinten wieder herunter zu springen. Kaum habe ich wieder Boden unter den Füssen, hat er mich in einem genialen Bogen von hinten schon wieder erreicht und das Spiel beginnt von Neuem. Ich bin erst gerettet, als es mir gelingt, in einem grossen Satz auf den Bürgersteig zu springen. Dort werde ich respektiert. Nun sind auf der Strasse einige Ausbesserungsstellen mit Teer und kleinen Steinchen, die man durch eine rotweisse Barriere kenntlich gemacht hat. Der Mann fährt nun in kühnen Kurven um diese Ausbesserungsstellen herum. Inzwischen kommt ein grauer, etwas grösserer Wagen von unten die Strasse hinauf. Es gibt beinahe einen Zusammenstoss. Die Wagen bleiben haarscharf nebeneinander stehen und mein verwegener Freund meint: "Nun wäre es doch beinahe noch schief gegangen - das kommt davon." Der Mann gefällt mir. Wir gehen zusammen in ein Haus. Er will dort irgendwelche Schriften hinbringen, um die Menschen aufzuklären - aber man hat den Eindruck, sie verstehen seinen Humor und seine Ironie gar nicht. Er geht einfach frech in die Zimmer, dass mein Erstaunen immer mehr steigt. Schliesslich reisst er eine Tür auf. Ich sehe jemanden im Bett liegen, der als mein fragender Blick ihn trifft, lächeln muss und den Kopf auf die Seite dreht. Da begreife ich, dass der Mann in sein eigenes Haus gegangen ist und mich mit dem ganzen Zauber nur aufgezogen hat. Der Spass ist sehr gelungen und ich erwache in heiterer Stimmung. (365 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0046 (1949-03-27 - Göttingen)Ich habe für einen Wettbewerb eine Plastik gemacht. Gekrönt werden je zwei Gemälde und je zwei Plastiken. Ich bekam den zweiten Preis. Die Büste stellt einen etwas dinarischen Kopf dar. Sehr dunkle Haare und tiefliegende, dunkle Augen, ein schmales Kinn. Ein wenig Ähnlichkeit mit Pastor Heinzeler. Dann ist - kurz vor meiner Abreise - zum Abschluss eine Feier. Pastor Heinzeler hält eine sehr tiefsinnige Ansprache. Mir prägen sich besonders die Gebärden seiner Hände ein, die mir eigentlich den tiefen Sinn seiner Gedanken vermitteln. Hinterher werden die Gemälde vorgezeigt. Hindenburg ist auch erschienen. Er wird zuerst in den Saal geführt und ich höre noch, wie Heinzeler ihm auf französisch sagt: "Hier sind die Gemälde - und hier die Plastiken". - Ich verhalte meinen Schritt im Fortgehen noch etwas, um zu hören, ob noch mein Name fällt. Dann kommt Hindenburg heraus, um mich zu begrüssen. Ich rede ihn im Verlauf der Unterhaltung drei Mal an. Einmal als Herr Generalfeldmarschall, einmal Exzellenz und einmal Herr General. Er ist sehr freundlich, hat ein strahlendes Gesicht und leuchtende, braune Augen. Er verabschiedet sich sehr herzlich. Dann träumte mir, ich sei aus diesem Traum erwacht und erzählte nun jemandem, wie ich im Traum eine Büste gemacht und den zweiten Preis dafür bekommen habe, aber das sei nur im Traum möglich.

Ein von hinten auf seinem Rad vorbeikommender Kriegsversehrter mit einem Bein und einer Prothese kommt dabei zu Fall und liegt nun - obgleich nicht verletzt - so unglücklich über seiner Prothese, dass er sich nicht erheben kann. Ich fasse ihn nun unter die Schultern und ziehe ihn hoch, während er sich auf sein Rad stützt. Im Fortgehen will ich meinen Arm um ihn legen, um ihn sicherer gehen zu lassen, doch er meint, das sei nicht nötig - er habe sich ja nicht weh getan. (102 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0048 (1949-03-28 - Göttingen)Ich bin in Roggow. Jedoch ist das schöne, alte Schloss von einem verständnislosen neuen Besitzer sehr ungünstig verwandelt worden. Er hat es völlig umgebaut, doch so, dass man den alten Grundriss noch erkennen kann, und innen merkwürdig ausstaffiert. Auf dem oberen Flur im Treppenhaus stehen an der Aussenwand wie in einem Krankenhaus nebeneinander lauter weisse Betten, zwischen ihnen je ein Nachttisch, der mit grünen Girlanden geschmückt ist. Auf jedem steht eine schöne Nachttischlampe, die mit einer Schnur an einen Steckkontakt angeschlossen ist. Über den Betten, zwischen den Fenstern hängen Madonnen-Bilder - und zwar serienweise immer drei oder vier mal nebeneinander die gleichen. Sie sind alle im italienischen Stil. Der eine Typ hat Ähnlichkeit mit einer weissen emaillierten Reliefmadonna auf blauem Grund, wie wir sie früher zu Hause hängen hatten und wie sie wohl häufig in Böhmen hergestellt wird. - Nun traf ich vor dem Haus Frau v. Oertzen, die mir die einzelnen Besonderheiten dieses nun so merkwürdig veränderten Hauses zeigen wollte. Sie hatte ein grosses Schlüsselbund, mit dem sie in alle Gemächer und Gänge hineinkam. - Als wir aber hineingehen wollten, musste sie unbewacht draussen einen Pferdewagen zurücklassen, für den sie aufzupassen hatte. Da es aber nur ruhige Ackerpferde waren, die ihm vorgespannt waren, machte sie dies Wagnis - doch schon als wir das Haus betraten, sah ich im Umkucken, wie eins der Pferde, durch ein von hinten kommendes Fuhrwerk erschreckt, zur Seite ausbrach. Ich sagte aber nichts, um mir den Genuss dieser Führung nicht entgehen zu lassen. So betraten wir denn das Haus und sie führte mich durch viele kleine Winkel und Gemächer. Dort hing in einer Kammer ein Vasenbild, das sie besonders liebte und an dem sie sich in diesem allgemeinen Durcheinander von Geschmacksverwirrungen wieder erfreuen mochte. Sie erzählte, dass es sie an ihre Jugend erinnere, an einen kleinen Theaterspiegel, den sie besessen - also einen kleinen Spiegel, mit dessen Hilfe man sich - ins Theater gegangen - frisierte - in den man von unten herauf so hineingesehen hätte, dass man nebenbei die einzelnen Bilder, eine Art Rokoko-Dame darstellend, miterblickt habe. 

Vor dieser Szene hatte sich der Traum schon weiter zurückerstreckt. Wir gingen durch einen Park, der diesmal mit dem von Wittmoldt das gemeinsam hatte, dass er auf einer Insel im Wasser lag. Hier war zwar eine Änderung der Anlage geplant und angefangen, aber nicht zu Ende geführt, so dass hinter den einzelnen Staffagen noch der alte Nützlichkeitssinn der ehemaligen Besitzer hindurchschaute. Z.B. sah man hinter einer Baumreihe, die Wald vorstellte, aufgerichtet eine Art Heuschober, lang hingezogen, in welchem unter dem trocknenden Heu noch Holz für den Winter aufgeschichtet lag. Hier ging ich mit Vater - und zwar war es nun während dieses Spazierganges der Park Rothspalk - und er erzählte, mit wie kurzsichtigen Mitteln irgendein Narr versucht hatte, eine neue Anlage zu schaffen. Er habe eine Fläche gerodet und gleich dort Rasen gesät, durch den ja das Unkraut durchbrechen musste - anstatt erst Bohnen und Kartoffeln zu pflanzen, die man ja auch gar nicht hätte ernten brauchen, da sie nur das Unkraut vertilgen sollten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0050 (1949-03-31 - Göttingen)Ich träumte von vielen unendlich feinen Gesprächen, deren Inhalt ich nicht mehr weiss und deren Feinheit der Form nicht mehr darzustellen ist. Ich führte sie mit den verschiedensten Menschen in den verschiedensten Räumen und Winkeln eines grossen Hauses. Schliesslich stand ich mit anderen Schlange vor dem Sprechzimmer eines Arztes. Da mir aber das Stehen zu langweilig wurde, verliess ich meinen Platz in der Schlange und setzte mich auf einem Stuhl, der mit anderen zusammen an einem Tisch in einer Sitzecke des Hauses stand. Plötzlich war aber die Schlange zu Ende und ich konnte nun ungehindert in das Sprechzimmer der Ärztin eintreten. Ich hatte meinen Waschlappen in der Hand, der noch feucht war, weswegen ich ihn nicht in die Tasche stecken mochte. So legte ich ihn zusammengedrückt auf eine Bank. Die Ärztin, die noch beschäftigt gewesen war, drehte sich zu mir rum, um mich zu untersuchen. Während wir miteinander sprachen, entdeckte sie den Waschlappen, hielt ihn für ein Taschentuch und wollte es aufheben. Als sie aber bemerkte, dass es ganz feucht war, warf sie es verächtlich in einem grossen Bogen aus dem Fenster. Ich legte meinen Arm um ihre Schultern und sagte lächelnd: "Nun haben sie meinen Waschlappen aus dem Fenster geworfen", wobei ich sie im Zimmer fortgehend so einige Schritte mittnahm. Es war eine kleine Frau, wohl Ende der Dreissiger, die einen weissen Arztkittel trug. "Ich muss ihn nachher unten aufheben", sagte ich mit freundlicher Miene und stellte mir vor, wie er den unten wandelnden Patienten auf den Kopf gefallen sein möge. Als ich unten ankam, sah ich neben dem vielstöckigen Haus, in dem ich gewesen war, eine kleinere Villa stehen. In dem schmalen Raum zwischen beiden lag mein Waschlappen in dem Garten der Villa. Ich ging schnell unbemerkt durch die Gartenpforte hinein, da ich nicht über den Zaun steigen mochte, ging dann um das Haus herum und holte mir meinen Waschlappen. Dann ging ich durch die Strassen der Stadt. Es war Hamburg. Zur Linken sah ich ein strahlend erleuchtetes Kino mit dem Reklameschild. "Das Capitol gegenüber dem alten Führer und dem neuen Führer". Gegenüber stand ein grosses Gebäude mit einer einzigen erleuchteten Glaswand zur Strasse. Dort war früher zu lesen gewesen: "Kreisleitung der NSDAP", jetzt stand die Aufschrift einer modernen Verwaltungsbehörde daran. Ich ging nun die Treppe im Treppenhaus hinauf und hörte und sah gleichzeitig, wie in einem Film, in dem zeitlich auseinanderliegend Aufeinanderfolgendes in fortlaufender Reihe in Bildern gezeigt und in Worten erläutert wird, so sah ich, wie das verfallene Gebäude wieder hergerichtet worden war, wie es zuerst durchgeregnet hatte und die Tropfen auf die Treppenstufen des gekachelten Treppenhauses fielen, dann wie es sauber gemacht wurde und mir jemand, mit dem Besen die einzelnen Stufen abfegend, entgegenkam usw. Gleichzeitig hörte ich die Beschreibung dieser Errungenschaften. Als ich in einem oberen Stockwerk angekommen war, war es Winter und das Eis in der Strasse, die nun zu einem Fluss geworden war, schwoll immer mehr an, bis es in meiner Höhe war und ich an dem Rand entlang ging. Noch immer wurden alle Bilder von einer, wie im Film, erklärenden Stimme begleitet. Autos und Wagen fuhren über das Eis und ich wunderte mich, dass sie nicht einbrachen. Dann kam mir ein schlittschuhlaufender Junge entgegen, mit ganz grossen, langen Schlittschuhen, mit denen er keine Kurven laufen konnte. So kam er ganz gerade auf mich zu und wäre mir über die Füsse gefahren, wenn ich ihn nicht im letzten Augenblick gefasst und meinen Arm um ihn gelegt hätte. Wir unterhielten uns eine Weile. Dann sah ich, wie andere das Eis überquerten, um an das andere Ufer zu kommen, obwohl es schon dünn war. Ich ging weiter und trat in eine Pfütze und spritze mich dabei voll. Ich trug eine kurze Flanellhose, denn es war schon warm, und lange seidene Strümpfe, die ich bei näherem Zusehen als Damenstrümpfe erkannte, worüber ich mich wunderte. Ich fühlte mich in der Leichtigkeit der Kleidung sehr wohl. Dann lief auch ich über das Eis und kam auf der anderen Seite über einen Acker, den ich nun mit dem jüngeren Kai zusammen in Wittmodt überquerte. Bald waren wir auf einem Feld, das zu bearbeiten war, und er sagte, wenn wir um zwei Uhr her gehen, müssen wir eigentlich um fünf fertig sein. In drei Stunden könnten wir das schaffen. Ich stimmte zwar zu, hatte aber ein ungemütliches Gefühl bei dem Gedanken an körperliche Arbeit. Dann ging der Weg weiter. Ich ging mit einem Knecht neben einem Gespann. Es waren zwei Gespanne zusammengespannt, aber mit unzureichenden Mitteln, sodass bei abschüssigem Weg der hintere auf den vorderen Wagen rollen musste und die Pferde dazwischen verletzt werden. Es waren braune Pferde. So hielt ich denn mit an dem Strick, der den Wagen zurückhalten sollte. Schliesslich kam ich dabei auf dem Wagen zu liegen, und zwar so, dass vier Räder unter mir waren und an meinem Anzug schleiften und dass ich eigentlich nur auf diesen Rädern lag. Ich schrie dem Knecht:"Halt, Halt!" zu, aber er fuhr immer schneller, und hielt erst an, als er mich verstanden hatte. Ich fragte jemand, ob mein Anzug gelitten habe, und er sagte, es sei ein kleines Loch. Als ich mich umschaute, sah ich drei dicke Bremsenspuren von den Rädern auf ihm und der Stoff war völlig abgeschabt. Es war mein guter, grüner Anzug und ich war sehr verzweifelt. Ich lief einen kleinen Hang zu einer Brüstung hinunter, von wo man eine schöne Aussicht hatte und legte meinen Kopf auf die Mauer und überliess mich meiner Verzweiflung, die wie eine erwürgende Leerheit in mir war. Dann tröstete mich irgendjemand und ich erwachte. (924 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0051 (1949-04-01 - Göttingen)Ich bin im Hause eines alten Herrn aus Anlass einer Gesellschaft. Er bekommt einen Schwindelanfall, als ich gerade bei ihm stehe. Ich lege den Arm um seine Schulter, um ihn zu seinem Bett zu führen. Als wir an einem grünen Sofa vorbeikommen, haucht er noch mit letzter Kraft: "Hier dieses Sofa", und ich lasse ihn dort nieder. Es stellt sich heraus, dass er schon ein Jahr lang schwer herzkrank ist, ohne dass seine Frau etwas davon geahnt hat. - In der nächsten Traumszene ist es ein wesentlich jüngerer Mann. Er liegt auf dem Sofa ausgestreckt. Die ganze Gesellschaft sitzt noch um ihn herum im Zimmer. Als er aus seiner Ohnmacht erwacht, sitze ich an seinem Kopfende. Er redet wirres Zeug wie im Fieber und sagt, es sei immerhin keine Kleinigkeit, wenn man die Tollwut gehabt habe. Ich höre sehr gespannt seinen Reden zu und begreife den tieferen Sinn, der noch hinter seiner äusserlich ungereimten Worten steckt. Der Mann hat einen Kopf von auffallender Schädelbildung, eine grosse, gewölbte Stirn und einen weit nach hinten ausladenden Hinterkopf. Das Gesicht läuft nach unten relativ schmal zu, so dass er den Eindruck eines sehr klugen, aber wenig energischen Mannes macht. Ich habe die Hand auf seine Stirn gelegt und führe sie leise hin und her. Er bittet mich, ihn noch länger so zu kraulen und zu massieren, das sei so wohltuend, und ich versuche, dies mit grösster Leichtigkeit und Feinheit auszuführen. Als ich dabei einmal auch die Gegend des Hinterkopfes berühre, bittet er mich, mit medizinischen Ausdrücken, nur die vordere Kopfpartie zu massieren. Ich wechsle die Hände manchmal ab, wenn sie müde geworden sind, und berühre zuletzt nur noch ganz fein mit den Fingerspitzen seine Kopfhaut zwischen den über der Stirn schon spärlichen Haaren. Als es ihm schon wieder besser geht, habe ich ihn auf dem Wege durch die Stadt zu begleiten. Wir gehen über eine Art Bahnsteig. Der Schaffner ruft:"Vorsicht, der Zug fährt ab!", nachdem mühsam alle Reisenden eingestiegen sind, und ich sehe einen einzigen Strassenbahnwagen mit einer französischen Aufschrift abfahren. Ich frage, was das zu bedeuten habe, und mein Patient, dem ich noch immer den Arm um die Schulter gelegt habe, antwortet mir, dass wir hier ganz dicht an der holländischen Grenze seien und dieser Wagen führe nur bis zur Grenze. Wir gehen weiter durch die Stadt. Dort sehe ich einen sehr schönen, sehr alten romanischen Rundbau. Bei näherem Zusehen entdecke ich, dass er schon frühgotische Züge trägt. Ich halte es zuerst für eine Kirche, erkenne es dann aber als ein Brunnenhaus. Mein Begleiter legt einmal seinen Kopf auf meinen Arm zurück. Ich denke, er bekomme wieder einen Anfall, aber er sagt nur, es sei dies so wohltuend für ihn. Er hat nun die Züge eines Vetters von mior angenommen. Wir suchen einen Konzertsaal in der Stadt, zu dem die übrige Gesellschaft mit der besagten Strassenbahn gefahren ist. Wir können den richtigen Weg nicht mehr finden und ich sage zu ihm:"Wollen wir doch das geschminkte Mädchen fragen, das dort an der Ecke steht". Er geht etwas betroffen auf sie zu und spricht einige Worte. Als er schon im Fortgehen ist, frage ich sie nach dem Weg und sie antwortet mir und redet mich dabei mit dem Vornamen meines Bruders an. Ich schaue ihr ins Gesicht. Sie ist sehr schön, hat dunkle, schwarze Haare, einen tiefsinnigen russischen Gesichtsausdruck und kräftige rote Lippen. Besonders der Blick der Augen prägt sich ganz tief ein. Ich frage sie:"Woher kennen Sie meinen Namen?" Sie antwortet mit den Worten: "Frag mich nicht". Ihr Gesicht bekommt einen tiefschmerzlichen Ausdruck und sie wendet sich zum Gehen. In diesem Augenblick begreife ich, dass es die Frau des Vetters, eine nach Frankreich emigrierte Russin sein muss. Ich fasse im Gehen ihre Hand und ziehe sie, die mir nur widerstrebend folgt, noch einmal so weit zu mir heran, dass ich auf die von hinten gereichte Hand flüchtig einen Kuss drücken kann, ehe sie sich aus der meinen löst. Dann laufe ich meinem Begleiter nach, der auf der anderen Strassenseite in grossen, kräftigen Schritten dem Konzertsaal zustrebt. Er bedarf meiner Stütze nicht mehr. Er mutet mich jetzt noch wesentlich grösser und schlanker an als vorher und trägt eine grüne Uniform. Wir fragen einen entgegenkommenden Polizisten nach dem Weg, der uns nun entgültige Auskunft gibt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0052 (1949-04-02 - Göttingen)Spaziergang mit Krischan (Christian) und einem ihm bekannten Mädchen. Wir stehen vor unserer Haustür und Krischan drückt während des Gesprächs bei heftigem Gebärden, doch ganz in Gedanken, zweimal die Klingel meiner Oberbewohner. Als ich begreife, was passiert ist, rate ich zum Weitergehen, um eine peinliche Situation zu vermeiden. Auf dem Wege höre ich noch, wie die Frau, die uns oben aus dem Fenster gesehen hat, ihre kleine Tochter hinter uns her schickt. Ich denke mir schnell eine Geschichte aus, mit der man das Mädchen abspeisen kann. - Nächste Traumszene: Wir sitzen nun zu dritt auf einer kleinen Bank des Abends auf einem Platz in der Stadt. Um uns herrscht reger Betrieb. Die Frauen kucken aus den Fenstern und unterhalten sich über die Strasse. Aus ihrem Gespräch kündigt sich an, dass jetzt der Förster kommt, eine anscheinend wichtige Person im Stadtleben. Nun sehen wir ihn aus einer Seitengasse kommen, über den Platz spazieren, eine prächtige Erscheinung. Er hat einen grünen Anzug an und trägt einen weiten Hut auf dem Kopf. Er ist begleitet von zwei Frauen, deren eine zu ihm zu gehören scheint, während die andere mehr wie eine zufällige Begleitung wirkt und sich auch nach einigen Schritten allmählich einen eigenen Weg in anderer Richtung sucht. Uns gegenüber auf einer Bank auf der anderen Seite des Platzes sitzt eine Frau im Pelzmantel, von der wir schon wissen, dass sie etwas von dem Förster will. Wir hören nun, wie die Frauen aus den Fenstern rufen, jetzt sei es die Zeit für sie, zu ihm zu gehen. Sie hat sich unschlüssig von ihrer Bank erhoben und jammert laut, dass es für sie doch keinen Zweck haben werde, die andere Frau da schiene er ja auch weggeschickt zu haben. Krischan ist jetzt aufgestanden, um etwas von der Sache zu erforschen und mit dem Förster zu sprechen, der bald die andere Seite des Platzes erreicht hat. Ich sehe nun, wie sich die Frau ihm nähert. Erscheinung und Bewegung der Figuren haben etwas Marionettenhaftes, Distanziertes und wirken wie auf einer fernliegenden Bühne. Gleichzeitig höre ich, wie die Frauen sagen: "Hört ihr seinen Pfiff" und vernehme ein feines, sehr einprägsames Pfeifsignal von der anderen Seite des Platzes wie ein Vogelpfiff. Das Mädchen neben mir folgt der Szene mit gleicher Gespanntheit. Wir erkennen, wie sich die Frau dem Förster zu nähern vermag. Ich bemerke, dass es oft auffällig ist, wie es Frauen in impulsiver Weise verstehen, sich der Situation zu bemächtigen und wie oft sie es sind, die die ersten Brücken zu einem Verstehen schlagen. Sie antwortet mir, dass diese Frau nur etwas ganz äusserliches von dem Manne wolle. Während unser beider Blicke gespannt auf die Situation gerichtet sind, rücken wir auf unserer Bank aneinander und ich lege meinen Arm um sie und ziehe sie ganz nahe zu mir ran. Dann kommt ein Student vorbei und setzt sich auf den hierdurch auf der rechten Seite frei gewordenen Platz. Als Christian zurückkommt, sagt er nur: "Aber Kinder, so können wir doch heute Nacht hier nicht schlafen". Der Student rückt nun ganz an das äusserste Ende der Bank, so dass er eigentlich nur noch halb und wie ein ungern gesehener Gast auf ihr sitzt. Wir rücken nach und Krischan setzt sich links neben mir nieder. Es erscheint mir ein ungemütlicher Gedanke, auf dieser harten Bank des Nachts schlafen zu sollen, und ich überlege, warum es Krischan vorzieht, anstatt zu uns nach Hause zu wandern. (564 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0053 (1949-04-02 - Göttingen)Heute nacht unterhielt ich mich in einer Kette von Träumen mit den verschiedensten Personen. Besonders in Erinnerung geblieben sind mir davon nur zwei. Das eine war ein Altersgenosse, der aus der Kriegsgefangenschaft heimkehrte. Es war ein Klassenkamerad meines Bruders. Nun fand er beide Eltern tot und alles ausgestorben. Dies Leid ergriff mich so sehr - es war in der Zeit kurz nach dem Tode meines Vaters, dass ich aus dem eigenen Innern einen Strom tiefer Trauer hervorquellen fühlte - obgleich ich sonst dem Tode meines Vaters sehr nüchtern und sachlich kühl gegenüber gestanden hatte und keine Träne vergossen, weil ich ihn nur wohltuend und als reife Frucht empfand. - Hier nun war es ein süsses Gefühl, die Trauer aus einer grossen Tiefe hervorquellen zu sehen. Er ergriff meine Hand und tröstete mich, und gehalten von dieser festen Form, gab ich mich ganz der ausströmenden Traurigkeit hin und fühlte mich so, wunderbar geöffnet und atmete tief auf. - In dem anderen Traum war ich bei meiner Mutter, die schon schwer lungenkrank, auf ihrem Bett lag. Wir sassen beieinander und fühlten uns sehr innig verbunden und während wir sonst grosse Distanz wahrten, um jede Ansteckungsgefahr zu vermeiden, empfand ich hier eine Gleichgültigkeit gegen alle praktischen Rücksichten und war bereit, dem Wert dieser Stunde alle Vorsicht zu opfern. Ich spürte bei meiner Mutter ein ähnliches Empfinden und ähnliche Konsequenzen, so dass ich nur leise erschrak, als, da ich näher mich zu ihr auf das Bett gesetzt hatte, mein Fuss den ihren berührte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0054 (1949-04-04 - Göttingen)Ich war in Roggow. Doch hob sich das Bild feinen Glanzes und edler Formen schon von dem düsteren Untergrund revolutionärer Stimmungen und Unruhe ab. Ich ging am Morgen durch die Räume des Schlosses. Es war ein strahlender schöner Sommermorgen in aller Frühe. Plötzlich hörte ich Musik. Ich beugte mich aus dem Fenster, doch sah nichts, nur die stille morgendliche Landschaft. Dann schaute ich in einer anderen Himmelsrichtung hinaus. Als ich zum Fenster ging, hörte ich schon am nahen Klang der Musik, dass es hier sein musste. Ich beugte mich hinaus, und sah eine Dorfkapelle aufgebaut. Als ich hinabging, fand ich Herrn und Frau v.O. (von Oertzen), die Geburtstag hatte. Die Leute gratulierten. Als sie fortgingen durch die Räume des Hauses, sahen sie den schönen Gabentisch und einen gedeckten Tisch. Ihre spitzen Bemerkungen durchzuckten mich wie ein plötzlicher Schreck. Herr v.O. sagte noch ein freundliches Wort und sie gingen. Es war etwas Unheimliches in der ganzen Situation. Herr v.O. zeigte mir das Frühstückstischchen und sagte, "den zu decken, war eigentlich Eure Aufgabe. Jetzt rasch, hole mir den richtigen Teller, der dort hingehört, ich habe nur irgend einen ergriffen." Dort stand, richtig aufgebaut, irgendein Service, das wohl lange nicht mehr gebraucht im Schrank gestanden hatte. Ich betrachtete es und schickte mich an, das neue zu holen. (214 words)

Als sie beendet sind, sehe ich noch ein Mädchen in einer wunderbaren Beherrschtheit ihres Körpers einige Übungen ausüben. Ich will ihr beispringen, doch nur bei einigen Bewegungen, in denen es besonders schwer ist, die Gleichgewichtslage zu halten, gestattet sie, dass ich ihr die Hand zur Hilfestellung reiche. Dann jedoch sagt sie: "Sie können sich ruhig hier auf diese Seite ganz zu mir stellen" und bittet mich, den Teppich, auf dem sie bei ihren Übungen steht, noch ein wenig zur Seite zu ziehen. Dann stehe ich auf dem Rande des Teppichs. Es ist eine wunderbare Schönheit in ihren Bewegungen, die keineswegs darin aufgeht, eine sinnliche Freude zu sein, sondern viel mehr hoch über einer solchen schwebt in einer grossen praktischen Uninteressiertheit und in beglückender Leichtigkeit.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0057 (1949-04-10 - Göttingen)Ich sah irgendwo eine Schlange stehen. Es wurden Liebesgaben verteilt. Doch war es mir zu anstrengend, mich mitanzustellen. Als ich mich erkundigte, was dort verteilt werde, erfuhr ich, dass man auch eine Reise nach England geschenkt bekommen könne. Man musste seine Wünsche irgendwie aufzeichnen. Ich sah einen Tisch, in den kleine Heftzwecken gesteckt wurden. Auf einer Heftzwecke entdeckte ich eine kleine Sonne, die auf ein Stück Papier gekritzelt war, welches um den Kopf der eingesteckten Zwecke geschlagen und auf diese Weise festgeklemmt war. Bei näherem Zuschauen erkannte ich den Tisch als eine Landkarte von England ohne Ortseintragungen. Jeder steckte seine Zwecke dorthin, wo er hinreisen wollte, und schrieb den Namen des Ortes daneben. Ich sah schon die Namen London und Kent dort stehen und versuchte, den Namen Biddenden - das ist der Ort, wo meine Verwandten wohnen - an die richtige Stelle in Kent zu schreiben. Dann fiel mir noch ein, dass ich auch den Namen Bishopsdale (so heisst ihre kleine Farm) dazuschreiben müsse. Ich hatte nun mit meiner grossen Schrift fast die ganze Landkarte vollgeschrieben. Die beiden Namen sprangen auf den ersten Blick in die Augen. Ich war gewiss, in meinen Wünschen berücksichtigt zu werden. Um meine Heftzwecke einzustecken, musste ich vorher ein Papier um sie schlagen und durch die übergeschlagenen Enden dieses Papiers den Stift der Zwecke bohren, damit es sich nicht loslösen könne. Dies wollte mir nicht gelingen und ich schaute voll Sorge auf die Tür, in der nun die Schlange verschwunden war und hinter der gerade die letzten Leute abgefertigt wurde. Gleichzeitig war ich froh, um das Schlangestehen herumgekommen zu sein. Hierbei wandelte sich die Szene. Ich stand in einer Kirche und hatte meine Zwecke auf dem Altar zu befestigen. Doch musste ich vorher ein grosses Tuch herumschlagen, das eigentlich viel zu gross war. Als ich endlich fertig war, trug ich den so entstanden weissen Gegenstand, der auf einmal viel grösser war, schnell nach vorn und drücke ihn fest auf die Deckplatte. Vor dem Altar stand ein Pastor, der gerade mit einer Lesung beschäftigt war. Erst jetzt wurde ich gewahr, dass ich ihn in der Ausübungen seiner Funktion störte. Ich ging zu meinem Platz in der vordersten Reihe zurück und stellte mich wieder zwischen die anderen Menschen. Mir wurde sehr schlecht, und ich sagte zu Emmi, die neben mir stand: "Ich kann nicht mehr stehen" und setzte mich dann sofort und etwas ostentativ nieder. Da entdeckte ich, dass nun auch alle anderen Menschen schon sassen. Nur Emmi stand noch. Es war ihr wohl peinlich und sie machte einen Anlauf und sprang und klettere über die erste Bank, um sich in die zweite Reihe zu setzen. Wohl wollte sie etwas in den Hintergrund gerückt sein. - Mir war sehr heiss geworden und ich hatte mir sofort die Jacke ausgezogen und dafür meinen blauen Rollkragenpullover angezogen. Nun wollte ich mir die Jacke wieder anziehen doch war sie inzwischen zu dem Pastor am Altar geraten. Ich bat sie zurück und er warf sie mir unwillig an den Kopf. Ich sagte sehr laut und deutlich. "Auch in der Kirche kann man höflich sein". (513 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0058 (1949-04-11 - Göttingen)Ich war zur Heilgymnastikstunde bei Annelie aus Hildesheim und lag auf meiner Bank zur Rückenmassage. Vor mir hatte ich ein Kunstgeschichtsbuch liegen, das ich dort irgendwo aufgetrieben hatte, und in dem ich blätterte. Sie schaute über meine Schulter mit in das Buch. Als ich an eine Aktdarstellung im Rubenschen Stil kam, merkte ich, wie sie sie ganz nach anatomischen Gesichtspunkten beurteilte. Sie hatte einiges daran auszusetzen, auch an der Farbe, die einen goldenen Schimmer von eigentlich sehr grosser Feinheit über die Haut legte. Unter dem Bild stand aber zu meiner Verwunderung der Name Botticelli - Jedoch nicht mit dem Vornamen Sandro, sondern mit irgend einem anderen. Als ich weiterblätterte, stiess ich auf Handzeichnungen von Goethe. Auf der nächsten Seite waren humorvolle Zeichnungen von ihm, die Frauen mit ganz grossem Doppelkinn darstellt, jedoch nur ganz fein angedeutet, sodass man sie nur erraten konnte. - Dann folgten ausgedehnte Wiedergaben von Goetheschen Kinderzeichnungen. Ich meinte entrüstet, dass es eigentlich wirklich unnötig sei, so die Blätter mit künstlerisch völlig nebensächlichen Kinderzeichnungen zu füllen, bloss weil Goethe ein berühmter Mann gewesen sei. Das gehöre nicht in eine Kunstgeschichte. Es entspann sich zwischen uns ein lebhaftes Gespräch, in dessen Verlauf sie sich einmal versprach und mich Du nannte. Ich drehte mich um und schaute ihr schalkhaft in das Gesicht, das in seiner Feinheit der Linien wirklich an einen Botticelli oder Filippino Lippi erinnerte. Sie tat aber, als ob sie gar nichts merkte, und redete mich ruhig weiter mit Du an. Ich antwortete ihr auf die selbe Weise. Und erst später im Verlauf des Gespräch liess sie es unmerklich in die Sie-Form zurückgleiten. Ich wollte noch einmal Du sagen, aber ich erwachte. (275 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0059 (1949-04-18 - Bayern)Ich gehe am oberen Rande eines hohen Abhanges und unterhalte mich mit Menschen, die an seinem Fuss und auf halber Höhe wandern. Ein Offizier gibt Instruktionen über den Verlauf und die strategischen Fehler des Ostfeldzuges. Er sagt, Durchbrüche könnten nur dort gelingen, wo eine Truppe schon einmal Erfolg dabei gehabt hätte, oder wo sie Vertrauen auf eine besonders gute Ausrüstung haben dürfe. Er sprach von römischen Legionen. Ich erlebte es mit und sah mich als einen aus ihren Reihen. Das Gepäck war eingeteilt und wurde den vorauseilenden, schnell beweglichen Mannschaften nachgeschickt: ein Rucksack Waffen, ein Rucksack Ausrüstung und ein Rucksack Kleidung und ein Päckchen Rosinen. Ich sah mich einen Augenblick lang auf einem Lagerplatz, umgeben von all diesen Herrlichkeiten und mit ihnen glücklich. - Dann nahm das Gespräch eine andere Wendung. Frau v.Oertzen war auch da und beschenkte uns mit Eiern. Ich versuchte, zu essen, doch wusste ich nicht, wie ich das weiche Ei halten sollte, nachdem die Schale abgepellt war. Ich balancierte es mit grosser Mühe im letzten Moment in einen Eierbecher. Wenn ich die Bissen zum Munde führen wollte, rutschten sie vom Löffel oder schlappten aus dem Munde. Das Gespräch glitt ab ins Komische. Ich zog in der Pose mein Taschentuch aus der Tasche. Dabei flatterte ein anderes, kleines, dreckiges Taschentuch mit hinaus, ausserdem viele Papierfetzen und Eierschalen, die sich über die Stufen des Abhanges verteilten. Ich eilte hinab, um alles wieder aufzusammeln, und versuchte indess, dass Gespräch wieder auf ernste Dinge zu lenken, was mir mit Mühe gelang. (251 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0060 (1949-04-19 - Bayrischzell)Ich sah den Angeklagten Weizsäcker (im Wilhelm Strassen-Prozess). Er sah völlig ungebrochen aus. Er trug die Schlipsnadel, die ich immer trage, einen goldenen Knoten, an dessen freien Enden zwei kleine Perlen hängen, und hatte meine goldene Uhr, deren Deckel er so energisch zuschlug, dass die Perlen eingeklemmt wurde und kleine Stücke herausgebrochen wurden. Ich hörte, wie alle anderen Angeklagten sagten, dass sie die Gefängniszeit wohl nicht überstehen würden, er aber sagte, dass er noch viel vorhabe und in dieser Zeit nicht zerbrechen werde.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0061 (1949-04-19 - Bayrischzell)Ich war beim Psychotherapeuten. Er stellte fest, dass das Erlebnis, das mich am tiefsten bewegt habe, auf einer Reise mit meiner Mutter nach Kärnten gewesen sei. Ich war verwundert, denn es war nicht das stärkste und erfuhr, dass nicht die Stärke, sondern die Tiefe des Erlebens massgebend sei. Ich versetzte mich in die Erinnerung und empfand eine wohltuende elementare Losgelöstheit. (60 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0062 (1949-04-20 - Bayrischzell)Ich ging zu Weizsäcker, um mich mit ihm über Psychotherapie zu unterhalten. Wir führten ein längeres Gespräch. Adelheid war zeitweise auch dabei und es handelte sich um Vater. Dann ging ich zu Gisela. Sie wohnte in einer mehrstöckigen Neubauvilla in einem kleinen, von der Treppe zugänglichen, Zimmer. An der Tür steckte ein Zettel mit der Aufschrift "Für Herrn v.Uslar und für Herrn Krydt". Sie selbst war nicht zuhause. Ich kniete mich vor die Tür, um das Briefchen, das unter den Zettel geklemmt war, herauszuziehen. Dabei kamen Leute die Treppe rauf, denen ich im Wege sass. Auf dem Briefchen stand. "Lieber Herr v.U. Seit zwei Tagen warte ich vergebens abends oder morgens, irgendwann auf einen Besuch. Unser erstes Wiedersehen war zu kurz und zu lang, um von keinem weiteren gefolgt zu werden. Sie glauben gar nicht, wie ich mich von hier wegsehne. Ihre Gisela." Ich überlegte, dass ich schon zweimal sie nicht angetroffen habe, dann sah ich um mich die Berge und es fiel mir ein, dass ich noch gar nicht wieder in Göttingen sei und das beruhigte mich, da ich nun wusste, dass ich also nichts absichtlich versäumt hatte. Als ich das Haus verlassen hatte, merkte ich, dass ich nur eine Nachthose anhatte. Es war mir sehr peinlich, in diesem Aufzug bei Weizsäcker gewesen zu sein. Dann aber entdeckte ich, dass ich doch eine grüne Hose darüber hatte, die ich doch nicht erinnerte, übergezogen zu haben, unter der die Nachthose nur herausguckte. Ich steckte sie ein und beruhigte mich dabei. - Übrigens hatte ich oben auch den Zettel an Herrn Krydt mit einem Blick gestreift und gesehen, dass es sich um eine ganz unpersönliche Mitteilung handelte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0063 (1949-04-26 - Göttingen)Ich hörte im Radio die Eroika. Emmi war auch im Zimmer zusammen mit noch mehreren anderen Leuten, die sich unterhielten. Es war in Wittmoldt, von dem ich vorher schon manches geträumt hatte, zum Beispiel, dass es uns verboten worden war, auf dem Flügel zu spielen, der im Jungens-Zimmer stand, damit nicht die neuen Lehrlinge dies sehen und selbst dort den ganzen Tag spielen wollten. Es war dies eine Sparmassnahme, die von Tante Jusi ausging. Auch hatte ich den eigenen Schlüssel zu unserem Zimmer zurückgeben müssen. Nun gebot mir Emmi auch noch, das Radio abzustellen, da es bei der Unterhaltung störe. Das Orchester begann gerade, den zweiten Satz der Eroika zu spielen, und ich war völlig in der Musik befangen. - In einer Mischung von Wut und Verzweiflung versuchte ich sehr energisch und in Pose, den Aparat abzustellen, doch nach jeder Drehung und dem Knacken im Aparat, was man beim Abstellen hört, wurde es zwar etwas leiser, doch die Musik war nicht zum Schweigen zu bringen. Ich eilte die Treppe hinauf. Auf halber Höhe begegnete mir mein Bruder, der die Schlüssel zu unserem Zimmer in der Hand hatte. Ich forderte den Schlüssel und als ich ihn nicht gleich bekam, riss ich ihm das Schlüsselbund aus der Hand und versuchte gegen seinen Widerstand den Zimmerschlüssel vom Ring zu lösen. Er wehrte sich - doch eigentlich nur zum Schein, um mir nicht sogleich nachzugeben. Dann aber begann er mich rührend zu trösten. Ich lief den Rest der Treppe empor - es war übrigens in dieser Szene das Treppenhaus in Schwerin - und streckte mich in meinem Zimmer auf das Bett aus. Von unten drang die Musik der Eroika herauf und ich wachte auf mit ihren Klängen im Ohr und zugleich in dem Gefühl eines wunderbaren Befriedigtseins. (293 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0065 (1949-04-27 - Göttingen)Ich befand mich in einer Art von Kabinett. Es war kein Wachsfiguren-Kabinett, aber so etwas Ähnliches. In langer Reihe sassen an den Wänden historische Figuren, jede auf einem Stuhl. Es waren hauptsächlich weibliche. Ein alter Herr ging zwischen ihnen rum und scherzte mit ihnen. Er wollte ihnen neue Frisuren machen. Dazu malte er mit einem roten Stift auf ihr Gesicht neben ihre biederen Frisuren die Konturen neuer modischer und eleganter Frisuren und erzählte ihnen dabei, wie anders und wie viel schicker sie nun aussehen würden. Einem Mädchen malte er im scherzenden Gespräch dabei eine rote Nasenspitze. Ich ging neben ihm her und unterhielt mich ebenfalls mit den Figuren. Einmal fragte ich eine etwas vorwitzig, ob sie denn auch aufstehen und sich bewegen könnten. Ich bekam zur Antwort, ich solle sie nur hochziehen, dann werde ich es sehen. Es war mir gruselig dabei zumute, denn die Figuren waren ja nur Gerippe, die unter den Kleidern verborgen waren. Lediglich die Köpfe waren ganz wie lebendige gebildet. Ich reichte ihr beide Hände, um die schwere Gestalt hochzuziehen. Dabei trat sie mir auf den vorgestellten rechten Fuss und dieser schmerzte sehr unter dem festen, knöchernen Tritt. Ich sagte, so geht es nicht, ich muss den Fuss erst wegziehen. Endlich hatte sich die Figur ganz erhoben und wankte im Raume hin und her. Als sie wieder sass, sagte ich zu ihr: "Du hast ja einen abgebrochenen Stock in der Hand", denn sie trug in der Tat einen Krückstock, der dicht unter der Krücke abgebrochen war, in ihrer Rechten. Da sank sie lächelnd auf die linke Seite herüber, so dass das Krückstockende nun auf die Stuhllehne gestützt war, so wie man wohl auf Statuen irgend ein solches Stöckchen zur Stützung der Figur an einem Sessel oder einem Stamm oder ähnlichem Hilfsgegenstand angebracht sieht. Ich sah nun, dass die Figur also wieder ganz in ihrer alten Haltung sass, in der das Krückstockendchen nicht mehr abgebrochen wirkte, da man das längere Ende des Stockes wie bei einer Plastik, als hinter dem Stuhl verborgen, einfach nicht sehen konnte. - Ausser dem alten Herrn und mir befanden sich noch zwei Jungens im Saal. Der eine schien mir wie zur Oberwelt zu gehören. Er war etwas wie ein kleiner Phantast, der dort zwischen den Gerippen herumforschte. Der andere aber war dort unten zuhause, obwohl lebendig. Er schien so etwas wie ein Hausmeisterssohn zu sein, hatte einen runden Kugelkopf und war etwas stupide, wenn nicht gar schwachsinnig. Darum versuchte der andere Junge, sich von ihm fernzuhalten. Ich sah sie beide durch den Raum laufen. Der kleine Phantast wollte wieder nach draussen in die Oberwelt und der Rundkopf lief hinter ihm her, wohl um ihn zu halten und rief "Passt nur auf, dass er uns nicht wegläuft, damit er nicht verrät, dass wir das Ei erfunden haben", oder so etwas ähnliches. (Ich kann mich leider nicht mehr ganz scharf besinnen, ob es wirklich das Ei war, oder etwas ähnliches, das sie erfunden hatten, ich glaube aber doch das Ei). 

Später sah ich beide oben auf der Strasse laufen, und zwar trug der kleine Junge jetzt ein blaues Gewand mit langen Hosen (wie ein Indianeranzug - aber sehr leicht) und hüpfte seitwärts auf der Strasse fort wie im Polkaschritt. Gegenüber auf der anderen Strassenseite bewegte sich auf die gleiche Weise der Rundkopf. Beide hatten das Gesicht einander zugekehrt. Der Junge erzählte phantastische Geschichten, von denen ich fast alles vergessen habe. Nur erinnere ich noch, dass er an irgendeinem Platz, wie Kinder es sich oft vornehmen, etwas aufbauen und lebendig werden lassen wollte, was an irgendeine historische germanische Vorzeit erinnerte. Die Attribute dazu hatte er sich aus jenem Knochenkabinett gemaust, es waren irgendwelche wichtigen Teile von Wotans Pferd und eine grosse germanische Rundbrosche und anderes. - Überhaupt hatte sein ganzes Vorhaben Ähnlichkeit mit dem Unternehmen einer prähistorischen Ausgrabung und auch der Platz, den er gewählt hatte, stand mit solchen Dingen im Zusammenhang.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0066 (1949-04-30 - Göttingen)Ich bin im Kellergeschoss eines grossen, kasernenartigen Gebäudes. Dort begegnen mir Figuren aus meiner Militärzeit. Ein kleiner, elastischer Wachtmeister, der mir gut gefiel, kommt seitlich aus einem Gang, der das Gebäude der Länge nach durchläuft. Er war Westfale, doch erscheint er hier im Traum als Italiener. Ich mache einen Unteroffizier nach, der durch seine eckigen Gebärden und eine bullerige, etwas lispelnde Sprache besonders komisch wirkte. Nachher steht er selbst in seinem Diensteifer vor mir. Ich versuche, die räumlichen Zusammenhänge dieses Kellergeschosses wiederzuerkennen. Ich selbst befinde mich in einem Gang, der quer zu dem andern (also die kurze Seite des Gebäudes) durchschneidet. Doch kann ich ihm nicht einfach folgen, dort wo er den andern Gang überkreuzt, denn er ist durch zwei Glastüren abgesperrt, zwischen denen neuerdings ein Extraraum gebildet ist, den ich noch nicht kenne und der etwas Unheimliches hat. Der Eintritt ist verboten. Der Gang führt in einem Halbkreis drum herum. Inzwischen hat sich die Szene gewandelt. Ich bin nun in einer grossen Gemeinschaftsküche. Ich habe dort ein grosses Gefäss mit Kuchenteig abzugeben. Dazu klettere ich barfuss auf den Küchentisch. Das ist so üblich. Auch erkenne ich den Koch wieder, der zu mir kommt, um den Teig zu übernehmen. Er kommt gerade zu mir auf den Tisch geklettert. Auch das andere Personal kenne ich. Es sind die Mädchen aus Wittwoldt. - Aber er klettert noch einmal von der Tischkante herunter, um jemandem zu helfen, der seitlich eine Treppe herauf und dann hinter dem Vorhang zum Vorschein kommt. Ich höre den Namen Hella, bin aber erstaunt, nur einen Boy zu sehen in langen, getreiften Hosen und ebensolcher Bluse, die Haare allerdings hochgesteckt wie in einer weiblichen Frisur. Dann erst begreife ich, dass das kesse Mädchen sich so sehr in diese Rolle hineingespielt hatte, dass man sie zunächst nicht wiedererkennt. Als ich nachher auf dem Fliesenfussboden der Küche bei den andern Mädchen stehe und schon im Begriff, wieder zu gehen, da ich meinen Auftrag erfüllt habe, ist da noch ein anderes Mädchen, das ich vom Volkstanz her kenne, nicht sonderlich hübsch und etwas merkwürdig - aber auch nicht direkt schlecht aussehend. Sie möchte noch meine Hilfe in Anspruch nehmen und ich gewähre sie ihr ungern. Sie sagt, oben auf Station gibt es noch viel zu tun. (Wir sind also jetzt in einem Krankenhaus). Ich frage, was es denn zu tun gibt. Sie lächelt. Die anderen Mädchen lächeln auch. Ich begreife schon, worum es sich handelt. Sie sagt: Oben vor den Türen stehen lauter Pöttchen. Während wir noch so sprechen, kommt unsere Volkstanzlehrerin mit mehreren anderen Mädchen in einem sportlichen Anzug und ganz sportlichem Gebahren von der Seite herein. Die Mädchen, mit denen ich auf einem Haufen stehe, sind jetzt auch alle vom Volkstanz. Ich schaue den Ankommenden entgegen und sie mustern mich mit strengen Blicken - halb im Scherz. Die Anführerin tritt mir entgegen und ich sage - ebenfalls im Scherz - "Huh, ein Mann im Nonnenkloster", versuche aber dabei, meine Rolle ernsthaft zu spielen, verschwinde schnell hinter einem Vorhang, der gerade neben mir ist, und hinter dem es unmittelbar eine Treppe hinabgeht, deren Stufen ich hinabsteige, während ich noch mit dem Oberkörper in den Raum hinein rage und es mir noch nicht ganz gelingt, mich hinter dem Vorhang zu verbergen. Dabei wird der Scherz fast zum Ernst und ich erwache mit dem spannenden und unheimlichen Gefühl einer C.F. Meyerschen Novelle. (559 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0067 (1949-05-01 - Göttingen)Ich hatte ein Fernlastauto quer durch Deutschland über grosse Strecken zu fahren. Dafür, dass ich das erste Mal am Steuer sass, ging es ganz gut. Ich versuchte sorgfältig, mit den Füssen Gashebel und Bremshebel auseinander zu halten und gewann mit der Zeit eine gewisse Sicherheit in ihrer Unterscheidung. Einmal, als ich nach hinten gegangen war, um etwas zu erledigen, hatte ich den Wagen so stehenlassen, dass er in einem von Strassenbahnschienen gebildeten Dreieck stand. Die vorbeikommenden Bahnen konnten gerade an ihm vorbeistreifen, doch einmal erfasste ihn ein breiterer Wagen und schleppte ihn ein Stück mit. Ich eilte nach vorne und konnte nun in der Aufregung die Hebel nicht richtig unterscheiden. Ich fragte meinen Beifahrer, dessen Antwort mir aber offensichtlich Unkenntnis zeigte. Er hielt die Gangschaltung für den Bremshebel. In dem Gefühl der Überlegenheit meines Wissens beruhigte ich mich wieder und konnte nun die einzelnen Hebel richtig handhaben und ein Unglück verhüten. 

Zweite Traumszene: Ich war mit einem Schiff in Amerika angekommen. Nun wusste ich nicht, wohin. Zunächst versuchte ich, mein Gepäck bei der Aufbewahrung abzugeben. Dabei liess ich meine Brieftasche liegen. Dann wollte ich meine beiden deutschen Reisebegleiter nach dem Weg fragen. Doch zwischen den vielen Menschen, die dort waren, wurde ich unsicher im Wiedererkennen und alle, die ich anredete, antworteten mir auf Englisch, das ich nicht verstand, und machten sich über mich lustig. Ich ging nun zur Gepäckaufbewahrung zurück, um meine vergessene Brieftasche zu holen. Der Mann wollte sie unterschlagen, doch ich wies ihm nach, wo sie hingefallen sein müsste und bekam sie wieder. Nun beschloss ich, den Konsul eines kleinen europäischen Landes, der mit mir gereist war, um weiteren Rat zu fragen, und erkundigte mich nach dem Konsulat seines Landes. Allein, dort war er nicht bekannt und nie angekommen. - Später fand ich mich in einer Art Werkstattraum wieder, in dem zwei Männer grossen, würfelförmigen, gemauerten Ofen, wie einem Backofen, beschäftigt waren. Es war eine unheimliche Umgebung und ich vermutete hier den Konsul. Durch eine unvorsichtige Bemerkung des einen Gesellen, etwa des Wortlauts "die nackten Füsse in einem Gefäss mit kaltem Wasser sitzt er dort unten in der Glut", erfuhr ich, dass der Konsul dort seit langem gefoltert wurde und noch immer am Leben war. Der eine Geselle wollte mich aus dem Fenster werfen, als ich Anstalten machte, an den Ofen heranzukommen. Es gelang ihm aber irgendwie nicht.

Dritte Traumszene: Ich sass in einem Filmatelier und las dort Bücher. Später schaute ich aus dem Fenster meines Zimmers, das ich dort bewohnte. Unter mir dehnte sich ein flaches Dach, wie bei einer Fabrikanlage. Es überdachte die eigentlichen Atelierräume. Dort kuckte aus einer Dachlucke ein Mann, von dem ich nicht wusste, ob es der Regisseur selber oder eine andere wichtige Persönlichkeit sei. Er sagte zu mir: "was wollen Sie eigentlich hier. Sie sitzen immer und lesen ihre Bücher. In die Räume des Ateliers sind Sie noch nie gekommen, andere Menschen, wenn sie hier sind, lassen sich alles von uns zeigen - das kann ich verstehen; aber Sie sind hier ganz sinnlos." Ich wollte ihm sehr von oben herab etwas antworten, da ich mich ihm turmhoch überlegen fühlte. Dann erwachte ich und malte mir noch im Halbwachen eine gesalzene Antwort aus. (530 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0068 (1949-06-02 - Göttingen)[Vorbemerkung: Der Traum kommt zeitlich nach seinem Datum erst nach dem folgenden Traum Nr. 69, ist aber versehentlich schon lange als Nr. 68 gezählt worden, so dass die Zählung auch so bleiben muss.] 

Ich ging durch eine zertrümmerte Stadt, doch waren die Trümmer schön und von grosser Form. In einer Strasse hatte sich das alte Ruinenbild verändert. Eine Kirche, die aus einem anmutigen Rund von Säulen und einer Kuppel bestand, die man ehedem hoch über sich schweben sah, war gleichsam auseinandergenommen und in mehreren Höhendurchschnitten flach auf den Boden gesetzt, so dass die Kuppel direkt vor einem auf der Strasse stand, ohne doch etwas von dem Eindruck der Höhe eingebüsst zu haben. Es war, als sei das ganze Kunstwerk in seine letzten Urelemente aufgelöst worden. Um die ganze Trümmerstätte zog sich ein Kranz von feinen Rauchsäulen. Sie rührten von den Explosionen her, die jene Sprengung veranlasst hatte. Ich ging mit grosser Eile, denn ich fürchtete, dass Gebäude könne über mich zusammenstürzen. Dabei lief ich mich in eine kleine Sackgasse fest, in die der Fusssteig sich in einer Trümmerbarriere verlief. So war ich auf drei Seiten von kleinen Schuttwänden umgeben, über die ich aber ohne Mühe hinwegklettern könnte, wenn nicht zwei Hunde mir den Weg verstellt hätten. Ich wagte nicht, den Sprung zu machen, weil mich die Hunde dann angesprungen hätten. Schliesslich stieg ich in eine Strassenbahn. Sie setzte sich in Bewegung, ehe ich wieder aussteigen konnte. An der nächsten Haltestelle suchte ich wieder hinauszukommen, ohne Geld bezahlt zu haben. Der Schaffner wollte mir einen verbilligten Preis machen. Schliesslich war er aber verschwunden und ich stand allein auf der Strasse. Neben mir war ein kleines, altes Kloster. Es war im gotischen Stil, aber architektonisch nicht sehr gelungen. Ich wollte noch einmal in den Strassenbahnwagen zurück. Doch als ich die Tür öffnete, geriet ich in das Kloster. Ich hörte drinnen die Stimmen von Nonnen und kehrte sofort um. Ich ging die Strasse fort, die wieder eine Sackgasse wurde. Am Ende sassen in einer romantischen Umgebung die Madonna von den Sieben Monden und der Räuber Nino, zwei Figuren aus einem englischen Film. Ich setzte mich zu ihnen zum Essen und genoss die Freiheit. Sie waren hier gleichsam privat, und bei allem, was sie taten - ob sie sich nun das Brot reichten, oder irgend etwas anderes taten - machten sie feine, humorvolle Anspielungen auf ihren Film. Schliesslich gingen wir zusammen auf die Strasse. Sie entschuldigte sich, dass sie nur Sandalen ohne Strümpfe trüge und ich sagte, dass ich dasselbe auch täte und froh darüber sei. (389 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0069 (1949-05-15 - Göttingen)Ich sass in einem grossen Raum und hörte Musik. Dann sah ich das Orchester spielen: Die Geigen bewegten sich alle im gleichen Takt, sehr schnell. Plötzlich sah ich, wie die Fanfaren aufgehoben wurden. Dann kam ein Stoss - so gewaltig, dass ich aufspringen wollte, wie man in der Kirche zum Gebet tut, und sah, wie noch ein paar andere Leute, die in den leeren Bankreihen sassen, dasselbe wollten, dann aber sitzenblieben, da sie ebenso wie ich im Aufblicken, wie aus einem Traum erwachend, merkten, dass sie ja nur in einem Konzertsaal waren. Es war Bachsche Musik. (Als ich erwachte, war Gewitter. Als ich mich niedergelegt hatte, war es schon sehr schwül gewesen. In den Ohren klangen mir die Melodien der 5. Symphonie von Beethoven, die mein Nachbar vorher lange auf dem Klavier gespielt hatte.) (134 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0070 (1949-05-22 - Göttingen)Ein grosser, junger Schäferhund auf einer Strasse. Gegenüber das Wohnhaus und daneben eine Baracke, in der ich nachts mit ihm schlafen sollte. Ich wollte den Hund über die Strasse locken und er erhob sich sofort, als ich sagte "Steh auf". - Als ich ihn aber mit Namen rief "Angka, komm", setzte er sich wieder und wurde immer störrischer. Schliesslich wollte er überhaupt nicht mehr und ich hörte, wie er in sich dachte "Jetzt bleib ich einfach sitzen". Er wollte mich beissen und mein anfängliches Überlegenheitsgefühl brach völlig in sich zusammen und wich der Angst. Einmal hörte ich auch in der Ferne ein Auto, so dass ich fürchten musste, er könne auf der Strasse überfahren werden. Plötzlich kullerte von hinten ein dunkler Gummireifen heran und traf den Hund im Rücken. Ich dachte: Was soll die Albernheit, das haben sicher die Kinder getan. Dann sah ich, wie der Reifen sich zur Schlange auseinanderrollte, die den Hund beissen wollte, und erkannte, dass diese Tiere sich auf solche Weise unerkannt an ihre Beute heranmachen. Auch wurde mir klar, dass die Schlange schon früher den Hund gebissen haben müsse, weswegen er so störrisch war. Doch war ich wie gebannt und wusste nicht, wie ich die Schlange töten sollte. Ich erwachte noch wie gelähmt von diesem Bann und ganz befangen von der Einsicht in etwas Furchtbares und zugleich heimlich Erregendes. In der nächsten Bewusstseinsstufe erschien mir das lachende Gesicht von einem Mädchen mit einem Mozartzopf, das ich zu einem Fest eingeladen hatte, und als ich die Augen ganz öffnete, schien das Bild der Maria aus dem Englischen Gruss an der Stirnwand meines Bettes ganz belebt, als wenn ein Schleier sich von dem Gesicht lösen und etwas von ihm ausströmen wollte, wie es dies eigentlich nur nach sehr schönen Träumen tut und wie es genau auch das Gesicht tat, nach dessen Ähnlichkeit ich einstmals das Bild ausgewählt hatte. (Gemeint ist Ika. Der englische Gruss ist von Veit Stoss. Das ursprüngliche Gesicht: Eli). (325 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0071 (1949-06-10 - Göttingen)Ort der Handlung: Unsere Wohnung in Schwerin. - Personen: Vater und Emmi. Es war eine Unstimmigkeit gewesen. Ich hatte irgendwelches Geschirr zerbrochen. Nun sollte ich den Tisch decken und ging aus irgend einem Grunde über den Flur in die Küche, nachdem ich vorher im Tellerschrank gesucht hatte. - Die Wut stieg so in mir hoch, dass ich auf dem Flur gehend sagte: "Jetzt schmeiss ich einen Teller kaputt". Dann nahm ich den Teller, den ich in der Hand hatte, und zerknackte ihn am Boden. Vater und Emmi, die es gehört hatten, kamen entsetzt von innen heraus. Es kam zu einer Auseinandersetzung, die damit endete, dass Vater zu mir sagte: "Von der Rute will ich absehen" - ich unterbrach ihn: "das will ich mir auch verbeten haben" - "aber Du bekommst heute abend nichts mehr zu essen". Ich sagte: "Weisst Du überhaupt, seit wann ich heute nichts mehr zu essen gehabt habe" - denn ich hatte seit dem frühen Vormittag nichts mehr gegessen - "aber das ist ja auch ganz nebensächlich", dachte und sagte ich dann, und es fiel mir auch ein, dass ich vor dem Konzert abends ein wenig gegessen hatte. - Ich ging in mein Zimmer (hinauslaufen mochte ich nicht, denn ich wollte doch wenigstens irgendwie von Emmi getröstet werden können, obwohl ich auch wütend auf sie war). Im Zimmer trommelte ich mit den Fäusten an die Wand und trampelte gleichzeitig mit den Füssen auf den Boden, bis ich erwachte. (241 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0072 (1949-06-19 - Göttingen)Ich liege nachts in meinem Bett und beobachte durch das offene Fenster auf dem Dach des gegenüberliegenden Hauses einen starken Funkenflug an einer elektrischen Leitung, den ich für feuergefährlich halte. Er sieht aus wie das Bild einer mehrfach verästelten, kleinen Blitzbahn auf dem Hintergrund eines schwarzen Nachthimmels. Ich will mit meinem Brunder darüber sprechen, doch der ist so müde und schon im Einschlafen, dass er mich nur immer bittet, endlich nicht mehr mit ihm zu sprechen, und meine Worte nicht mehr begreift. Wenn ich meine Nachttischlampe ausschalte, sehe ich drüben den Funkenflug noch stärker. Daran merke ich, dass das Brennen meiner Lampe nicht die Ursache sein kann. Endlich nach langer Zeit geht drüben in einem Zimmer unter dem Dach das Licht an. Die Einwohner müssen das Knistern über sich bemerkt haben und schicken sich an, zu löschen. Ich bin mir im Zweifel, ob man einen so elektrisch verursachten Schaden durch einfaches Löschen beseitigen kann. Dann sehe ich ein kleines Mädchen mit Zöpfen und Haarschleifen auf dem Dach erscheinen. Ich werde von einer furchtbaren Angst befallen, das Mädchen könne vom Dach stürzen, und kann nicht mehr hinsehen, sondern verberge den Kopf in der Bettdecke und muss auf einmal beten. Ich wundere mich selbst darüber. Es ist jetzt dunkel geworden, das Mädchen ist wieder in seiner Stube und hat das Licht gelöscht. Doch schon nach kurzer Zeit - wie ich befürchtet hatte, werden die Funken wieder sichtbar. Nun erscheint Vater und ich flehe ihn an, die Feuerwehr zu benachrichtigen, aber er ist mit anderen Dingen beschäftigt und hat kein Ohr für mich. Schliesslich sagt er "Ach, lass mich in Frieden, ich kann den Kerl nicht leiden", denn er hat eine Antipathie gegen den Mann, der da zu benachrichtigen wäre. Stattdessen trägt er nur schöne Geburtstagsgeschenke herum, um mich zu beruhigen, Kinderspielzeug und rote Spielbaukästen. Ich bin tief verzweifelt, dass er mich so wenig ernst nimmt und ganz wie ein Kind behandelt und sage, ob es denn gleichgültig sei, ob das Haus dort drüben morgen früh noch stände oder abgebrannt wäre und ob diese anderen Dinge etwa wichtiger seien.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0073 (1949-06-20 - Göttingen)Erster Traum: Ich träumte innerhalb weiterer Zusammenhänge von einer elektrisch geladenen Weckeruhr, von der Blitze ausgingen. Es war der Taschenwecker meines Bruders. (22 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0074 (1949-06-20 - Göttingen)Onkel Adolf arbeitete als Konsistorialrat in der deutschen Kirchenregierung. Diese war auf dem Lande untergebracht. Ich wohnte auf dem selben Gut und wollte ihn in seinem Arbeitszimmer besuchen, um ihm irgendeine belanglose Bestellung auszurichten. Ich erstaunte, als ich sah, dass die ganze Kirchenleitung in einem winzigen, verfallenen und verbauten Häuschen, wohl einem ausgebauten Hühnerhaus, untergebracht war. Der Portier sagte mir, er könne mich leider jetzt nicht einlassen und fragte nach meinem Namen. Dann aber kam er nach einer Weile wieder und sagte: Bitte treten Sie ein, Herr Kapitän Lieutenant. Er wies mich eine kleine Treppe hoch, dort eine Tür am Korridor links. Als ich dort versuchte, hineinzukommen, sagte mir eine Frau, von hier aus würde ich das Zimmer schlecht erreichen, ich würde besser von aussen hereinkommen, wenn ich hinten um das Haus herum ginge. Ich tat dies und fand dort schliesslich über einer kleinen, fensterartigen Öffnung an einem Fachwerkbalken des primitiven Mauerbaus die betreffende Zimmernummer eingeritzt. Die Fensteröffnung war zu ebener Erde, wie ein Kellerfenster, und mit Balken und Steinen verstellt wie bei einem Luftschutzkeller. Als ich die Steine fortgeräumt hatte, merkte ich, dass die Fensteröffnung nur in das oberste Ende des viel tiefer liegenden Raumes, in dem Onkel Adolf sass, hineinragte und ausserdem noch vergittert sei. Ich stellte mir vor, dass es mir unmöglich sei, mich da hindurchzuzwängen, und rief Adolf an. Dieser war sehr verstört über die Störung seiner umgebenden Ordnung und bedeutete mir, dass ich so nicht hereinkönne, eine Tür sei weiter links. - Schliesslich bemerkte ich nach langem Suchen, dass die zweite Tür weiter links auf einem weiteren Umwege in das Zimmer führe und erwachte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0075 (1949-06-21 - Göttingen)Ich blätterte in einem alten Buch und las viele Gedichte und Gedanken, die Vater bei seinen Lebzeiten mit der Schreibmaschine aufgeschrieben hatte. Ich fand dabei Gedanken wieder aus den Gesprächen, die er mit mir geführt hatte, als ich etwa 16 Jahre alt war und wir uns Abende lang über religiöse Dinge unterhielten, wobei die Meinungen scharf aufeinander platzten. - Dann las ich alte Briefe aus der Zeit unserer Grossväter und sah sie vergleichsweise mit Briefen unserer Zeit über die selben Gegenstände. Dabei nun sah ich, dass man damals alles religiös ausgedrückt hatte, was man heute einfach ohne Einkleidung beschrieb - doch hörte ich diese Briefe zwar, sah sie aber nicht, sondern ich sah etwas wie den Prozess ihrer inneren Entstehung. Es waren grosse Kästen, die in mehrere Abteilungen eingeteilt waren, welche mit irgendeinem Stoff angefüllt waren, dessen Oberfläche fest und verkrustet war, wie bei einem lange nicht bearbeiteten Gartenland in trockener Zeit. Durch den Vorgang nun, in dem die Briefe entstanden und den ich wörtlich als den Inhalt der Briefe vernahm, wurde dieser Stoff von innen aufgewühlt und wie beim Pflügen aufgebrochen, bis am Ende eine feste Form zurückblieb. - 

Das Ganze hatte etwas Ähnlichkeit mit den technischen Darstellungen im Film, die von den Worten des Ansagers begleitet werden. Ich empfand eine innere Beruhigung, als ich im Vergleich der Briefe merkte, dass man damals alles in religiöser Einkleidung ausgedrückt hatte, was man heute einfach als Beschreibung der Sachlage sagt, denn das zeigte mir, dass meine eigene Tendenz nur einem allgemeinen geschichtlichen Prozesse folgt. (Zeit des Traums: Gegen Morgen, kurz vor dem Erwachen, während schon mein Bruder beim Aufstehen war.) (269 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0076 (1949-06-21 - Göttingen)Kurz vorher hatte ich einen längeren Traum. Ich lag noch im Bett, während mein Bruder schon aufgestanden war und in der Stube wirkte. Mit ihm wirkte dort Tante Pinchen aus Wittmoldt. Es wurde immer später und ich gab mich sinnlichen Vorstellungen hin. Wenn sie an mein Bett kam, stellte ich mich schlafend. Schliesslich machte sie der Sache ein Ende, in dem sie mir einen Fliegenschirm über den Unterleib setzte und etwas von der Verderbtheit der Jugend sagte und ein Sprüchlein, etwa "Schlechte Gedanken verderben gute Sitten". - Ich bequemte mich nun, aufzustehen, doch wie ich auch den Wandschirm um den Waschtisch stellen wollte, immer fiel er um oder schirmte die Blicke entweder zum Fenster oder zur Tür hin nicht richtig ab. - Endlich kam Erna - der Hausgeist meiner hiesigen Verwandten - in die Stube. Ich rief: Das geht jetzt noch nicht. Sie aber sagte: "Das muss ich jetzt unbedingt haben" und holte aus der Stube das Kehrblech und den Besen. In diesem Traum und während des langen Liegens am Morgen darin geisterten Bilder aus einer grossen Gebirgstour, von der ich geträumt hatte. (Gleich folgender Traum Nr. 77). (188 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0077 (1949-06-21 - Göttingen)[In diesem Traum - Nr. 76 - und während des langen Liegens am Morgen darin, geisterten Gedanken und Bilder aus einer Gebirgstour, von der ich vorher geträumt hatte:] Ich sah die einzelnen Kirchtürme zwischen den Bergen und versuchte, mich zu besinnen, zu welchen Dörfern und Städten sie gehörten, durch die ich vorher gekommen war. Dabei dauerte es manchmal lange, bis die richtigen Namen mir einfielen, und ich erinnere mich, dass einzelne Namen einen Klang hatten, der dem der Dörfer und Städte in den slovakischen Gebirgen ähnlich war, die wir gegen Ende des Krieges durchzogen. 

- Die Türme, die ich zwischen den Bergen sah, waren teilweise sehr schön. Mir schwebt noch ein sehr flüssiger, fürstlich geformter Barockturm vor, der irgendwo sehr hoch in den Bergen aus einem kleinen Teil empor - ja, er reckte sich nicht, er zeigte auch nicht, er wuchs mit jener Leichtigkeit und Flüssigkeit und mit jener Würde und Serenität, mit der ganzen Präsenz, die uns heiter stimmt, wie sie nur barocke Bauwerke haben. Er stammte aus einem kleinen, breitstrassigen Flecken, der jenen wohlklingenden slovakischen Namen trug. (151 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0078 (1949-06-22 - Göttingen)Heute nacht träumte ich von Maria Reichardt. Ich traf sie plötzlich auf der Strasse, nachdem ich schon einige Tage wusste, dass sie hier war. Sie hakte mich ein und wir gingen eine Weile. Dann musste ich mich wieder verabschieden, weil in diesen Tagen meine Schwester zu Besuch war, die am Abend wieder fortfuhr, und die zur Bahn zu bringen ich versprochen hatte. - Das nächste Mal ging ich mit einer Medizinerin an dem Haus vorbei, in dem Maria wohnte. Wir hörten sie ein Kinderlied singen und sahen sie dann zum Fenster hinaus schauen. Ich zeigte sie ihr. Dann rief ich Maria zu, ich wolle sie nachher noch besuchen. Das war ihr zuerst nicht recht. Als sie aber erfuhr, dass ich dazu nicht extra mit der Strassenbahn fahren brauchte, war sie sehr erfreut. - Im Fortgehen fragte ich die Medizinerin, was sie von ihr gefunden hätte; da erfuhr ich, "sie hat Augen wie ein Arzt". Sie hatte sich in ihr angesprochen gefühlt. (161 words)

Zunächst war es sehr viel Polizei. Es fand gerade ein Wachablösung statt. Dann blieb nur ein Posten zurück, der aber ein grosses Gerät aufgebaut hatte, mit dem alle Passanten photographiert wurden. - Da ich nicht herein kam, beschloss ich, Gisela in ihrer Wohnung zu besuchen, da ich sie seit der Rückkehr von ihrer Reise noch nicht gesehen hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0081 (1949-06-26 - Göttingen)Ich traf mit I. (Ika) zusammen auf dem Lande. Wir verbrachten eine Nacht zusammen, halb schlafend, halb in besinnlichem Gespräch, zwar in enger Berührung, doch ohne einen Verkehr, um eine innere Grenze nicht zu überschreiten, die wir uns ohne Worte gesetzt hatten. - 

Zweite Traumszene: Ich hatte von Emmi den Auftrag, einen Sommeranzug für meinen Bruder zu besorgen. Ausserdem Knöpfe und einiges andere. Ich ging in ein Warenhaus und forderte Knöpfe. Unter der vorgelegten Auswahl fand ich durch Zufall solche, die der etwas seltenen Knopfsorte an meinem Regenmantel entsprachen. Nur schienen sie mir ein ganz wenig kleiner. Ich zählte in Gedanken aus, wieviele ich brauchen würde, doch da nicht so viele vorhanden waren, trug mir der Mann nun ähnliche heran in anderen Grössen bis hin zu der Grösse eines kleinen Bilderrahmens. Plötzlich bemerkte ich, dass ich den Regenmantel mit den alten Knöpfen ja gerade an hatte und konnte nun direkt vergleichen und auswählen. Dann erwarb ich einen gestreiften Anzug für meinen Bruder. - Erst später auf dem Wege merkte ich, dass ich in dem Halbdunkel und bei meiner Farbenblindheit einen kakelbunten Anzug gekauft hatte. Ich kehrte um und fuhr mit einer alten Frau im Kuller-Wagen die Strase bergab. Sie war es gewohnt, diese Strecke zu fahren und fuhr mit einer solchen Geschwindigkeit, dass wir am Schluss, als wir vor dem Gebäude ankamen- es hatte Ähnlichkeit mit dem Göttinger Bahnhof - mitten in die Bauarbeiter hineinfuhren, die dort die Strasse ausbesserten. Ich konnte aber so steuern, dass wir niemand anfuhren und nur über einige Eimer und Gefässe hinfuhren, die aber zwischen den Rädern Platz hatten. Vor dem Eingang waren Schwarzhändler. Ich ging in das Warenhaus mit dem Mann, der den Anzug verkauft hatte. Es war schon nach Geschäftsschluss und drinnen wachte ein Polizist. Der Mann verschwand und sagte: "Wenden Sie sich an meine Agenten". - Das Innere des Hauses hatte die Gestalt eines Museums, in dem sich die Schwarzhändler herumtrieben. Der Unauffälligkeit halber blieb ich noch eine Weile sitzen, als ob ich ein Gemälde betrachte. Der Polizist schnappte hier und da einen Schwarzhändler, ging aber an mir vorbei. Ich wurde unruhig und stand auf. Dadurch wurde er auf mich aufmerksam, kam auf mich zu, legte den Arm um mich und sagte: "Na, Junge, auch was verbrochen, komm auch mal mit in den Wagen". - Ich sagte: "Das, glaube ich, wird nicht nötig sein", verschwieg ihm aber die kleine Unrechtmässigkeit mit den Agenten, um unnötige Komplikationen zu vermeiden. Er schaute mir in die Augten und sagte: "Du bist mir gleich aufgefallen durch Deinen tiefen, dunklen Blick" - Er selber hatte strahlende, blaue Augen - "dann mach aber keinen Unsinn.". Er liess mich wieder gehen, nachdem er meinen Namen erfragt hatte, und ich ging und beschloss, nicht zu den Agenten zu gehen, sondern meinen Bruder morgen in der Geschäftszeit den Anzug tauschen zu lassen.

Traum am folgenden Tag (29.6.1949): Ich war mit Ika zusammen. Ich nannte sie Du und umarmte sie und küsste sie. Dabei fiel mir auf, wie eiskalt ihr Mund war und wie schmal ihre ganze Figur und doch wie kraftvoll ihre Leidenschaft. (75 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0084 (1949-06-30 - Göttingen)Ich war auf dem Lande zur Gartenarbeit. Auf der Suche nach Hacke und Harke geriet ich in eine Baracke. as Dach, das über ihre Aufgangstreppe gezogen war, so niedrig, dass ich nur gebückt gehen konnte und gezwungen war, mich irgendwo festzuhalten. Ich nahm an, es sei der Speiseraum der Gärtner und ekelte mich sehr. Später merkte ich, dass es sich um einen Schweinestall handeln musste. Die Gartenanlage selbst war von einem neuen Gärtner in romantischer Weise mit Palmen aufgezogen. In der Baracke sah ich einen alten Mann als Schweinemeister, der sich gerade auskleidete. Er hatte Ähnlichkeit mit der Dürerschen Figur des verlorenen Sohnes unter den Schweinen. Im Anfang des Traumes spielte Frau v. Bülow aus Wittmoldt eine Rolle, die mich zur Arbeit schickte. Später erschien Frau v.Oertzen, Roggow. (128 words)

Doch verwunderte ich mich, dass meine Hausnachbarn dort grosse Vorkehrungen trafen. Sie hatten Tische mit Kuchen aufgestellt und bauten Spaliere an die Wand. Auf den Gartenwegen liefen kleine Hunde, die mich ansprangen. Als ich mit einem spielte, biss er mich in den Finger. Als ich ihn darauf, sehr enttäuscht, genauer ansah, entdeckte ich, dass es ein sehr hässlicher, mopsköpfiger Hund war, über dessen Hinterlist ich mich nicht wundern konnte. (81 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0087 (1949-07-13 - Göttingen)Ich war bei Emmis alten Eltern. Vatting bastelte in seiner Werkstatt, Mudding las laut aus Büchern, die sie zwar in geistiger Wirre nicht mehr verstehen konnte, aus deren Worten und Zusammenhängen man sich aber den Sinn konstruieren konnte. Der kleine Enkel machte allerhand Streiche in einer Art Jungensbande und hatte dabei Geld gegen irgendwelche Dinge getauscht und grosse Verluste gemacht. - Emmi führte mich auf den Boden. Doch war der Weg dorthin nicht nur ein Treppenhaus und ein langer Flur, sondern zugleich winklige Strassen, die in eine lange grade mündeten (welche ja früher den Weg zu Muddings Wohnung gebildet hatten). Ich konnte mich nicht mehr ganz zurecht finden und fragte Emmi etwas. Sie sagte "Das weisst Du doch" - aber ich wunderte mich, dass jetzt in den Dimensionen alles viel kleiner schien, was mir als Kind gross erschienen war. Auf dem Boden war Vatting in seiner Werkstatt. Er führte mich zu den Jungens der Bande, zu denen der kleine Enkelsohn gehörte. Ich war verwundert, lauter grössere Jungens zu finden. Sie hatten sich eine Art Werkstatt aus Holzbänken gebaut, in der sie mit grossen Mauernägeln hantieren, die alle in gleicher Reihe dort lagen. Ich war erstaunt über die grosse Solidarität, mit der sie alle zusammenhielten. Sie hielten etwas wie eine eigene Gerichtsbarkeit, mit der sie über den Jungen urteilten. Ich sagte ihnen, dass er noch viel zu klein für ihre Masstäbe sei, sie seien doch schliesslich alle grössere Jungens. Sie antworteten, er sei doch alt genug, daran, dass er körperlich so klein sei, sei ich dann ja Schuld, denn sie hielten mich für den Vater. Ich klärte sie in dem Irrtum auf. (271 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0088 (1949-07-14 - Göttingen)Ich wurde von vielen Tieren, Katzen und Hunden, angesprungen, die ich vergeblich abzuschütteln suchte. Es war in einer ländlichen Umgebung und auch die Hilfe anderer Menschen vermochte nicht, mich von den Tieren zu befreien, die mir bis in den Nacken krochen. - 

Zweite Traumszene: Ich war als Wärter auf einem Leuchtturm. Es war eine militärische Situation. Während ich früher diesen Posten ohne weiteres hatte ausfüllen können, bekam ich nun auf einmal Schwindelgefühle, denn der neue Leuchtturm war überhaupt nicht richtig im Boden verankert und seine Plattform war viel zu klein. Ich kämpfte mit äusserster Konzentration dagegen, ohne die Schwindelgefühle loszuwerden. Schliesslich entschloss ich mich, hinab zu klettern, obwohl ich von den Umstehenden die Worte gehört hatte: "da ist einer, der simuliert nur". Um herab zu kommen, musste ich mit dem Kopf zuerst durch ein kleines Fenster kriechen, wobei der ganze Leuchtturm ins Wanken geriet. Dann rutschte ich innen in dem blanken Stahlgehäuse in grosser Eile und ohne Mühe hinab, bis ich festen Boden unter den Füssen hatte.

Dritte Szene: Ich sah nun ein Feuerschiff im Meer und hörte gleichzeitig das Geräusch der Funkgeräte und einzelne Bruchstücke der gesendeten Sprüche. Es handelte sich um eine Situation, in der die Besatzung in Not war und der Sohn, der die Besatzung führte, auf Befehl seines Vaters, des Leuchtturmwärters, an Bord bleiben musste. Dann wandelte sich die Szene bei gleicher Situation: Es war eine Luftwarnzentrale: eine grosse Halle mit vielen uniformierten Menschen zwischen einem Gewirr von Kabeln und Nachrichtengeräten. Sie übermittelten ihre Nachrichten mit grosser Präzision, doch durch einen Luftangriff kamen sie in grosse Gefahr und bekamen den Befehl, den Saal zu räumen und in einen Luftschutzkeller überzusiedeln. Doch hörte ich dabei Stimmen im Hintergrund: "Die werden in Sicherheit gebracht und durch die Unzuverlässigkeit eines provisorischen Nachrichtennetzes werden dafür Tausende gefährdet." Ich sah sie den Saal verlassen und durch Gänge und Räume fortstürzen. Dann ging der Weg weiter durchs Freie, durch Trümmer und kellerartige offene Steingänge. Man hörte schon das Motorengeräusch der Flugzeuge und dann die ersten Detonationen, bei denen dunkle Sprengwolken ganz in der Nähe aufstiegen. Wir warfen uns platt auf den Boden. Dann galt es, sich durch kleine Fensterlöcher in ein scheinbar unzureichendes, nicht von Häusern überbautes Kellergewölbe zu zwängen, und ich erwachte. (371 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0089 (1949-07-15 - Göttingen)Ich traf beim Baden einen englischen Vetter, einen schon älteren Herrn, der hier einen Verwaltungsposten inne hatte. Ich musste ihn auf dem Heimweg, als ich ihn begrüssen wollte, von hinten ansprechen, denn er ging sehr schnell. Er erschrak sehr und dachte, es solle ein Anschlag auf ihn gemacht werden. Er trug einen steifen Kragen, in dem er etwas altmodisch wirkte, und eine Brille. Dazu hatte er etwas krause Haare und war recht hager. Ich wusste nicht, ob ich ihn nun Du oder Sie nennen sollte, überlegte aber, dass ihm als Engländer dieser Unterschied kaum in die Augen fallen würde. Wir begegneten auf dem Wege zweimal militärischen Leichenbegängnissen der Engländer. Es waren Lafetten mit den Särgen, vor die ein ganzes Feld von Pferden gespannt war. Ich zählte einmal neunzehn Reihen hintereinander. Da sie alle unbemannt waren, wirkte es wie ein ganzes Geflecht von Pferden. Um das Gewicht auf dem abwärtsgeneigten Weg zurückzahalten, war hinter jede Lafette eine Strassenbahn gespannt. Der Engländer erkundigte sich bei einem der hinterher fahrenden Wagen, wer der Gestorbene sei. Es war ein hoher Verwaltungsbeamter und der Vetter wurde sehr bestürzt, denn er hoffte gerade von diesem eine Beförderung in eine höhere Stellung. Ich sah nun die Urkunde, in der für diese schon alles vorbereitet war. (208 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0090 (1949-07-16 - Göttingen)Man hatte neue Methoden zur Förderung des Getreide- und Futter-Anbaus erfunden: kleine Schaufeln wurden den Feldtieren an die Füsse und den Leib gebunden, mit denen sie bei jeder Bewegung den Acker umgruben. Diese Erfindung wurde ausprobiert an einem kleinen Zwerghahn. Es sah sehr putzig aus, wenn er mit seiner Bewaffnung an Krallen und Schnabel auf dem Acker umherlief. Plötzlich kam ein grosser Hahn und hackte auf das Tier ein. Doch unsere Erwartungen wurden nicht enttäuscht, nun einen lustigen Zweikampf zu sehen, denn von den scharfen Werkzeugen des anderen wurde der Angreifer übel zugerichtet. Aber der Zwerghahn, sicher geworden, wurde immer nachlässiger und schliesslich, als er wie ein Pfau triumphierend seine Federn spreitze, hackte der andere zu und schleppte ihn, wie ein Fuchs, der die Gans gestohlen hat, als Beute ab.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0091 (1949-07-16 - Göttingen)Nachmittags: Ich hörte aus einem anderen Zimmer Gisela Klavier spielen in einer wunderbar festen und sicheren Form und meinte, sie an dieser inneren Form der Töne wiederzuerkennen. Ich öffnete eine quietschende Tür in einen kleinen Raum und, wenn ich hinein ging, hörte ich Emmi und meine Schwester sprechen im Nachbarzimmer. Das Klavierspiel aber wurde leiser, wenn ich die Tür hinter mir schloss. Ich hörte Alli (Adelheid) sagen: "Ach, da quietscht schon wieder diese schreckliche Tür" und Emmi in einer sehr durchdringenden und schrillen Stimme antworten: "Ach, Du bist auch zu empfindlich; Wenn ich spreche, sagst Du, es ist zu laut und das Türquietschen stört Dich auch". - Ich öffnete noch einmal die Tür, - wobei sie wieder quietschte -, um die Musik besser hören zu können. Gleichzeitig stellte ich genaue Überlegungen über die Räumlichkeit an, wie es möglich sei, dass ich in diesem Raume das Gespräch besser, die Musik aber schwächer hören konnte, und kam zu dem Schluss, dass neben dieser Kammer noch irgendein Wandschrank oder vielleicht das Gehäuse einer kleinen Treppe sein musste, was sonst den Schall zwischen den beiden Zimmern und jetzt die Schallverbindung zu dem entfernten Raum, aus dem die Musik klang, isolierte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0092 (1949-07-17 - Göttingen)Ich war in einem fremden Land. Doch hörte ich in einem Haus die Geschichte vieler Männer, die nacheinander um eines Mädchens Willen in den Tod gegangen waren. Ich fragte tief erschüttert, ob in allen diesen Schicksalen es jenes Mädchen gewesen sei, das mir dort gegenüber sass. Die Frage wurde bejaht. Ich liebte das Mädchen und heiratete sie. Jeder der Männer hatte nacheinander ein Reis eines anderen Baumes auf einen grünen Zweig aufgepfropft. Ich sagte zu dem Mädchen: wir wollen diesen Zweig in die Erde stecken und wachsen lassen. Er wurde ein grosser Baum. An ihm wuchsen Weiden und Rotdorn und blühende Linden. Ich sah die Frau, als sie ein Kind geboren hatte und sehr glücklich war. Der Junge wurde grösser und sehr ungebärdig. Aber wir freuten uns daran. Er hatte etwas von dem slawischen Temperament ihres Vaters geerbt. Er ging mit kräftigen Schritten auf und ab, hatte wilde, fliegende Haare und forderte ungebärdig, eine fremde Sprache zu lernen. (158 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0093 (1949-07-18 - Göttingen)Ich ging in ein Café und bestellte mir zwei Stücke Kuchen, deren Preis eine geringe Geldsumme nicht überschreiten durfte. Dann setzte ich mich in einen Sessel etwas abseits am Fenster und war erstaunt, wie schnell der Kellner, der mich noch nie gesehen hatte, mich hier finden konnte. Es war dort auch ein älterer Herr, wohl ein abgedankter Offizier, von dessen Arbeit die Rede war. Es stellte sich heraus, dass er ganz primitive Arbeit tun musste. Er hatte ein modriges Wasserbecken auszuschaufeln, das man sehen konnte, wenn man durch das milchig trübe Glasfenster schaute. Ich verliess nun das Café. Ich war Offizier. Es war im Kriege. Ein anderer, sehr zuverlässiger, jüngerer Offizier begleitete mich zur Tür. Es war in einer kleinen, sehr unsicheren Stadt und ich sagte ihm, dass ich vor diesem Gang durch die nächtlichen Gassen dieser Stadt mehr Angst habe, als vor allen Gefahren des Krieges. Er erbot sich sofort, mich zu begleiten, aber ich wies es zurück, da es nur ihn und mich in Gefahr gebracht hätte. Ich ging so schnell wie möglich durch eine schmale, lange Strasse, die auf einem vieleckigen Platz endete. Dann hatte ich meinen Weg zu finden durch eine von zwei schmalen Gassen, die beide auf eine breitere Hauptstrasse führten, in der ich dann vor Überfällen sicher gewesen wäre. Ich wählte die rechte und ging schnell hinein. Dann musste ich links in eine Tür, zu der ich schon den Schlüssel in der Hand hatte. - Da hörte ich in der Ferne die Stimme des jungen Offiziers schallen, der mich begleitet hatte "Donner, Sie sind in der falschen Gasse, Sie müssen die linke wählen". (Ich führte den Namen eines Baron Donner). - Ich drückte den Schlüssel und einen 5-Mark-Schein schnell einem jungen Burschen in die Hand, der schon in der Tür stand und mich überfallen wollte. Dann lief ich so schnell wie möglich zum Platz zurück und bog in die richtige Gasse ein. - Später im Zusammenhang anderer Traumbilder sah ich noch einmal die Konditorei und schaute aus dem Fenster, als ich die Leute sagen hörte "Nun haben sie endlich das Wasser abgelassen". Ich sah, dass das grosse Wasserbecken, das den Hof bildete, leergelaufen und voller Morast war. Der ganze Lichthof, auf den unendliche Fenster mündeten, war überdacht von einem völlig dichten Glasdach wie von einem Oberlichtfenster. Ich stellte mir vor, wie hier eine denkbar ungesunde Luft entstehen musste. (394 words)

Ich musste den Jungen dauernd ermahnen: "leg dich nach vorne, leg dich nicht zu weit nach rechts", da wir sonst rückwärts die Treppe, oder seitwärts den Schacht hinabgestürzt wären, da alle Stufen nach rechts geneigt und die Treppe ohne Geländer war. Ab und an liessen die Fenster schon einen Ausblick frei auf die Stadt und ich konzentrierte mich immer mehr auf den Gedanken, dass ich jetzt auf keinen Fall schwindlig werden durfte, da ich die Verantwortung für den Jungen trug.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0096 (1949-07-22 - Göttingen)Heute Nacht träumte ich wieder, wie ich einem Hunde die Kiefer auseinanderhalten musste. Die Zähne bohrten sich immer tiefer in meine Hände ein und ich erwog, den Hund in einem grossen Schwung über den Zaun zu schleudern, um ihn loszuwerden. Aber ich wagte es nicht, weil er mich dann nur umso heftiger angesprungen hätte. 

Gegen Morgen träumte ich von einer grossen Tanzszene vor dem Nymphenburger Schloss. Alle Figuren spiegelten sich im Wasser und die Hauptfigur auf einer Insel hatte etwas von der Zentralstellung, die barocke Gartenfiguren in der Landschaft inne haben. Sie war bis an die Lenden geschürzt. Die Arme waren eingestemmt und der Körper hatte einen leisen Schwung in der Beugung nach aussen bei gebauschten Gewande. (117 words)

Ich fragte ihn nach der Herkunft seiner Bilder und war etwas enttäuscht, wieviel Zufälligkeiten dort im Spiele gewesen waren, die das kindliche Leben interessanter scheinen lassen, als es wirklich ist, weil wir seine Zufälligkeiten und Zufallsergebnisse mit den erklärenden Augen des Erwachsenen sehen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0101 (1949-07-28 - Göttingen)Ich war als Hospitant in einer grossen Nervenklinik und hörte bei der Visite die Ausführungen des leitenden Arztes über einen Mann, der infolge einer Gehirnerfrierung merkwürdige Verbrechen, wie zum Beispiel Überfälle auf die Dampfer einer Flussschiffahrtsgesellschaft verübte. Es war ein bekannterer Fall, über den schon diskutiert und geschrieben worden war. Deswegen wurden die Ausführungen sehr breit. Die genauen geographischen Umstände wurden festgehalten, zum Beispiel die genauere Lage eines Wäldchens etc. - Ich griff einmal zum Notizblock des Arztes, der mir dicht gegenüber sass, um genauere Angaben nachzusehen. Als ich merkte, dass der Arzt seinen Notizblock brauchte, schob ich ihn langsam zurück. Ich beobachtete ihn genau und dachte darüber nach, welches Gefühl seine Berühmtheit in dieser Situation erzeugen musste. Er war ein sehr junger Mann und trug seine Dinge mit einer gewissen Entäusserung, einer gewissen Scheu und Zurückhaltung, die die Bestimmtheit nicht ausschloss, vor. Während seines Vortrags verwandelte sich mir der Gegenstand seiner Rede in die Ereignisse während einer grossen Überseeschiffahrt, die ich nun erlebte. Wir fuhren unter den Klängen rhythmischer Musik in die Häfen exotischer Länder ein. (177 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0104 (1949-08-03 - Göttingen)Ich träumte mich als Reiter. Ich hatte eine Erbschaft zu übernehmen, mit der ich auch ein Amt antreten musste. Bei diesem hatte ich zwei grosse Lastzüge zu führen, die zuerst inspiziert wurden, und zuletzt bekam ich auch ein Pferd. Ich ritt sehr vorsichtig durch die Stadt und versuchte alle Komplikationen mit dem Autoverkehr zu vermeiden. Es gelang mir einigermassen, das Tier zu beherrschen. Auf dem Wege über den Theaterplatz hörte ich schon von Ferne Giselas und Christians Stimmen aus Giselas Zimmer. Ich wollte ihnen zurufen, um ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf mich zu lenken. In diesem Moment wurde das Tier scheu. Vor mir am Strassenrand war das Pflaster aufgerissen bei einer Bauarbeit. Ich versuchte, um die Stelle herum zu reiten. Doch konnte ich mein Pferd nicht mehr lenken, über das ich gerade erst das Vollgefühl der Herrschaft erlangt hatte. Es ging schliesslich rückwärts und drohte dabei, in das aufgerissene Loch zu stürzen. Ich zerrte am Zügel und das Pferd legte seinen Kopf zurück und biss mich in die Finger. Ich öffnete ihm vorsichtig mit der anderen Hand das Maul und während ich mich aus dem Biss befreien konnte, erwachte ich mit dem Bewusstsein, wieder von beissenden Tieren geträumt zu haben, und mit dem Gedanken an die triebhafte Grundlage dieser Traumbilder. Ich begann, sie aufzuzeichnen, und freute mich, als Datum schon den 3. dieses Monats einsetzen zu können. Es war mir sehr heiss und ich schlug die Decke weit zurück. Auch war ich verwundert, mitten in der Nacht so hellwach geworden zu sein, da mir sonst die Träume erst gegen Morgen bewusst werden. (260 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0105 (1949-08-04 - Göttingen)Ich suchte den Weg vom Flugplatz zu einem Vorort "Görries". Zunächst wurde ich durch einen langen, sandigen Anfahrtsweg an die Chaussee geschickt. Von dort rieten mir die Polizisten einen Abkürzungsweg, der fast in gleicher Richtung zurückführte. Als sie merkten, dass ich im Aufnehmen ihrer Wegbeschreibung unsicher wurde, fürchteten sie, ich könne mich im Walde verlaufen, da die Dämmerung schon hereinbrach. Da kam einem von ihnen der Einfall, ich könne den Fussweg gehen, der den Bahngeleisen folgt. Dazu musste ich über schmale, gitterlose Brücken balancieren und auch zunächst die Hilfe eines Beamten in Anspruch nehmen, der dort im Kahn auf dem Wasser fuhr, wo der Zugang zur ersten Brücke unterbrochen war. Ich fürchtete, von ihm abgewiesen zu werden, doch wurde ich dieser Sorge enthoben, da mich einer der Polizisten auf einem kleinen Umwege sicher an den Anfang des Pfades begleitete. Als ich allein auf dem Wege war, versuchte ich mich zu orientieren, und es fiel mir ein, dass mir Emmi als kleinem Kind zuweilen gesagt hätte: "Du gehst ja nach Görries", wenn ich anstatt des Nach-Hause-Weges die entgegengesetzte Richtung eingeschlagen hatte. Ich setzte noch im Erwachen diese Orientierungsversuche fort und versuchte durch ein Hinausprojizieren des Standpunktes meiner Göttinger Wohnung in die entgegengestzte Richtung der Stadt, die Lage dieses Vororts zu ermitteln. Dann erst fiel mir ein, dass Görries ein Vorort von Schwerin sei, bei dem der dortige Flugplatz gelegen war. Im Nachsinnen über die Lage der Göttinger Vororte schlief ich wieder ein und sah mich nun auf der Suche nach dem Weg nach Geismar. Schliesslich erreichte ich einen grösseren, ansehnlichen Ort, mit Marktplatz und Rathaus. Doch konnte ich niemand nach dem Namen fragen. Ich fand auf dem Platz einen regen, fast grosstädtischen Autoverkehr und als ich in eine schmalere Seitenstrasse einbog, sah ich eine sehr reizvolle Kinoreklame für einen Film mit dem Namen "Der blaue Traum", die mich heimlich befriedigte und fesselte. Dann befand ich mich auf der Suche nach einem Wahllokal. Ich musste in einem Behördenhaus viele Treppen hinauf- und hinabgehen und traf mich mit andern Verirrten und Suchenden. Schliesslich fand ich, der allgemeinen Richtung folgend, einen grossen, kellerartigen Raum, in dem an verschiedenen Wahltischen lange Schlangen standen. Da bei meinem Namensbuchstaben U niemand wartete, wurde ich sofort abgefertigt. Nachdem ich eine unbestimmte Weile in dem Raum geblieben war, streckte ich mich dort auf einem Bett hinter einem Wandschirm zum Schlafen aus. Doch wurde ich häufig gestört und schliesslich warfen Kinder, die mit mir spielend, einen seiner Flügel verstellen wollten, den ganzen Wandschirm um und ich erwachte. (417 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0106 (1949-08-05 - Göttingen)Ich traf einen Studenten beim Essen. Dann gingen wir um den Rasen herum. Später hörte ich ein Gespräch zwischen Student und Schuster. Jeder wollte dem andern klar machen, dass sein Beruf der schwerere sei. Als der Schuster gegangen war, versuchte ich dem Studenten klarzumachen, dass unser Beruf in der Tat leichter sei, weil wir ihn mit Freude betätigten - dagegen jener Schuster mit Unwillen. 

Ich träumte auch von der Lage eines Hauses im Strassenbild. Ich sah die Reihe der Häuser von hinten vom Stadtwall herabblickend. Während alle andern die Strasse säumten, war dieses Haus mitten in seinem Garten gelegen und es wurde ein Gespräch geführt, ob sich dieses Haus würde behaupten können, oder ob man jenen Garten als leer und raumverschwendend verschreien würde, weil man das Haus im Hintergrund nicht sah. Als ich erwachte, sah ich einen Wandschirm, an dem zwei leuchtend weisse Handtücher hingen. Als ich näher zusah, erkannte ich die bunten Fenstergardinen, von deren Fläche sich die hellen Felder der lichtdurchlässigen Rollos in scharfen Konturen abhoben. - Der Wandschirm ist etwas, hinter dem man Schutz suchen und sich verbergen kann. Mein Zimmer kann von der Strasse eingesehen werden. Ich überlege mir manchmal, ob ich hinter dem Wandschirm, der zum Fenster teilweise offen steht, beim Waschen genügend verborgen bin. (210 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0107 (1949-08-06 - Göttingen)Es war kurz vor Ostern. Zunächst ging ich mit Maria Reichhardt zum Bahnhof. Ihr Zug fuhr 9.15 Uhr. Dann waren wir Geschwister und unser Vater zusammen, der schon krank war. Er fiel dauernd hin und stiess sich dabei sehr. Schliesslich fuhren wir ihn in einem Rollstuhl. Mein Brunder stellte sich dabei sehr ungeschickt an und führte ihn dauern fast ins Gräben, zwischen engen Baumstämmen usw. - Schliesslich sassen wir alle beim Osterkaffee. Meine Schwester führte die Wirtschaft. In einem unbewachten Moment ging Vater allein heraus. Bald darauf kam Emmi und sagte, er sei im Ankleidezimmer wieder auf das Gesicht gefallen. Auf dem Flur stand eine Menge leerer Flaschen und Weingläster, deren Ordnung durcheinander gebracht war und die Spuren eines unsicher hindurch gegangenen Menschen zeigte. Vater tat sich merkwürdigerweise wenig bei den häufigen Fällen und so konnte ich ihm immer wieder aufhelfen. (141 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0108 (1949-08-07 - Göttingen)In meiner Wohnung sind zwei Einbrecher, von denen ich immer jeweils einen notdürftig bändigen kann, während der andere in der Wohnung verschwindet. Dieser Kampf zieht sich durch endlose Zeiten hin mit immer neuen Mitteln. Umschwenken des andern bis zu seiner Bewusstlosigkeit, Auf-ihn-Einschlagen wie auf eine halbtote Fliege usw. Schliesslich gelingt es mir, Margund zu verständigen, die ich als Schattenriss hinter der Glastür sehe. Sie soll das Überfallkommando anrufen. Ich rufe ihr noch die Treppe hinab meine genaue Hausnummer nach. Sie versteht 14 anstatt 40 und, indem ich noch einmal in aller Anstrengung das Wort vierzig hinausbringe, erwache ich über diesem Versuch und höre mich laut die Zahl vierzig sagen. Mein nächster Gedanke ist, ob Herr Stresau dieses laute Wort mitten in der Nacht gehört haben mag und wie er es deuten wird. (132 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0109 (1949-08-07 - Göttingen)Ich träumte ein langes Gesetz über Kastration und Sterilisation. Es war von dem, der diese Eingriffe verlangte, ein sorgfältig festgelegter Ritus gefordert, in dem er durch Handauflegung und unmissverständliche Bezeichnung sagen musste, was er von seinem Körper entfernt haben wollte. Ich las das Gesetz mit einer gewissen Abscheu gegen diesen handgreiflichen Ritus, bis ich begriff, dass in ihm die äusserste Sicherung gegen allen Missbrauch und alle Voreiligkeit geschaffen war. Es war ein "Nazigesetz" und ich erstaunte, dass man in Praxi so gegen sein eigenes Gesetz hatte verstossen können. (88 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0110 (1949-08-08 - Göttingen)Ich kaufe mir beim Bäcker einige Fünfpfennigstücke. Dann ging ich durch die Strassen und fand mich schliesslich vor dem Schaufenster der Töpferei. Ich schaute hinein und sah drinnen eine lustige Bilderfolge auf einigen Gegenständen. Ich musste darüber lachen und redete in meiner Freude leise vor mich hin. Plötzlich entdeckte ich Ikas Gesicht hinter der Fensterauslage, das mir lächelnd zuschaute, und begriff, dass man drinnen alle meine Worte gehört hatte. Ich machte eine drohende Gebärde mit dem Kuchen, als wenn ich ihn durchs Schaufenster werfen wollte. Dann öffnete ich ein wenig die Tür und schob eins der Stücke, das in der Form eines Löwen gebildet war, hinein, bis es in Ikas Mund landete. Wir wechselten einige Worte und sie wurde auf einmal sehr ernst. Dann ging ich weiter. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0111 (1949-08-08 - Göttingen)Ich war Braunschweig, um Margund zu besuchen. Um in die Wohnung in der 1. Etage zu kommen, musste ich durch ein Zimmer der Unterbewohner gehen, aus dem eine kleine Treppe in die Wohnung hinauf führte. Doch war die Treppe eingezogen und ich musste über Möbelstücke und die Fensterbank, mühsam mich von Stück zu Stück stemmend und immer neuen Halt suchend, hinaufklettern. Ehe ich mich an dem Fensterkreuz hinaufzog, prüfte ich sorgfältig, ob auch das Fenster fest geschlossen sei, so dass es mir wirklich Halt geben könne. Später frage ich Margund, ob der Eingang in ihre Wohnung immer mit solchen Schwierigkeiten verbunden sei, und erfuhr, dass noch eine zweite breite Treppe vorhanden sei, die in das Zimmer der Eltern führe. Jene kleine aber zögen die Unterbewohner immer zu den Zeiten ein, in denen das Theater keine Spielzeit habe, da dann keine Spätheimkehrenden dieser Treppe bedürften. (144 words)

Mein Bruder und ich haben jeder seinen eigenen Vorrat, aus dem wir Geschenke machen, selber essen usw., doch sind die meinen weich und bröckelicht und zerbrechen bei der ersten Berührung, während die meines Bruders fest und sehr haltbar aussehen. - Ich will in ein Konzert des "Driesch-Quartetts" gehen. Doch ist mir die Zeit der Aufführung entfallen. Mein Bruder meint, es sei morgens um sieben und ich stehe auf in aller Frühe. Dann entdecke ich auf der Karte die aufgedruckte Anfangszeit 20.30 Uhr. Ich bin sehr enttäuscht, denn um diese Zeit kann ich doch am Weihnachtstag nicht hingehen, aber Emmi meint, ich könne es schon machen. Sie stört es, dass das Konzert in der Kirche aufgeführt wird - aber ich erwidere: Driesch ist doch einer unserer besten Geiger, und sie lässt sich überzeugen. - Im Wohnungsflur steht ein kleiner Junge. Er bittet um etwas, erhält es und wird dann hinterher frech. Ich will ihm eine runterhauen. Er läuft weg und zieht den Kopf ein. Durch sehr bestimmte Worte bringe ich ihn zum Stehen. Ich muss ihm einige Stufen entgegen gehen. Um ihn zu schlagen, muss ich erst die Arme festhalten. Dann versetze ich ihm eine Ohrfeige, danach eine zweite. Doch bei der zweiten wird es Emmi zuviel. Sie protestiert und läuft hinterher. (216 words)

Wir liegen auf dem Bett und schauen aus dem Fenster auf einen Marktplatz. Ich spreche darüber, dass es in Göttingen einige wirklich schöne Plätze gebe: so dieser Markt (Er hatte in dem Traum Ähnlichkeit mit dem Markt von Schwerin), der Theaterplatz und andere. Überdem schläft Christian ein. Ich höre, wie seine Wirtin kommt, um ihm etwas zu bringen. Ich will es ihm sagen und bemerke dabei erst, dass er eingeschlafen ist. Doch gelingt es mir nicht, ihn zu wecken. Erst als die Wirtin klopft, erhebt er sich völlig verschlafen. (110 words)

Während er mit uns spricht, schaue ich ganz versunken in die Erbsen, die sich wie eine grosse grüne Mauer mit vielen weissen Blüten zwischen dem schwarzen Geäst des Erbsbusches aufbauen. - Als er vorbei ist, kommen die andern - es sind Jungens und Mädchen - hervor und Margund triumphiert, denn sie hat gerade gestern das Unkraut zwischen den Gartenkräutern gejätet, die man als ganz kleine Pflänzchen unten im Schatten der Erbsbüsche auf der schwarzen Erde stehen liess.

Alle anderen Umstände habe ich vergessen, da ich im Nachsinnen über den Traum einschlief und neue Bilder hinzufügte. So erwachte ich mehrere Male und schlief wieder ein und veränderte dabei den Traum, bis er sich völlig verwischte. Nur weiss ich noch, dass die Bilder allmählich ins Kriegerische übergingen und schliesslich in einem Gang an der Zonengrenze zwischen russischer und englischer Besatzung endeten. (89 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0124 (1949-08-26 - Wittmoldt)Ich hatte Besuch von Emmi in Göttingen. Wir wollten zusammen eine Reise machen nach Hamburg. Wir sassen schon beide mit allem unserem Gepäck im Zuge und dieser setzte sich vor seiner Abfahrt zum Rangieren in Bewegung. Emmi sagte hocherfreut: "Jetzt geht es los". "Nein", sagte ich: "Der rangiert erst". Dann stand er vor der Bahnhofshalle und wir mussten nun aussteigen, um aussen rum in die selbe zurückzugehen, um dort von neuem einzusteigen. An der Sperre wurde ich nicht durchgelassen, weil meine Karte schon gelocht war. - Hier erwachte ich ein wenig und malte die Möglichkeiten dieser Situation in Gedanken aus. So mag es gekommen sein, dass Emmi schon im Zuge sass, als ich weiterträumte. - Sie rief mir zu: "Du musst seitwärts eine Treppe rauf gehen". Ich rannte die Treppe hinauf, dann eine andere wieder herunter, bis ich schliesslich auf dem Bahnsteig stand. Das letzte Ende des Zuges sah ich gerade noch aus der Halle rollen. Ich rannte mit äusserster Kraft hinterher, natürlich vergeblich. Dann sah ich am andern Ende des Bahnsteigs das Ende eines anderen Zuges, der sich sehr langsam bewegte. - Obwohl ich wissen musste, dass er in die falsche Richtung fuhr, nahm ich noch einmal alle Kraft zusammen und lief, bis ich den Zug eingeholt hatte, der inzwischen wieder angehalten hatte. Es standen ausländische Namen an den Wagen. Als ich den Schaffner erreicht hatte, sagte ich zu ihm: "Entschuldigen Sie, fährt dieser Zug nach Göttingen?" "Nein", sagte er, "diesen Triebwagen dürfen sie ausserdem auch nicht benutzen". - "Gibt es eine Möglichkeit, den D-Zug, der eben abgefahren ist, noch wieder einzuholen?" - "Nein". Ich stand nun hoffnungslos auf dem Bahnsteig, nachdem auch die letzten Illusionen zerbrochen waren, und erwachte. (281 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0125 (1949-08-25 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte, ich suchte auf einem langen Flur ein Zimmer wieder, in dem ich gewohnt hatte, konnte es jedoch nicht finden. Ich schloss eine Tür nach der andern auf, wobei sich der Schlüssel immer mehr verbog, und sah in jedem Zimmer eine andere Möbelanordnung als die gewohnte. Schliesslich kam ich auf die Idee, dass ich das ganze Haus in verkehrter Front durchsucht hätte und brauchte mich nur auf die gegenüberliegende Seite des Flurs zu wenden, um auf Anhieb die richtige Tür zu finden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0126 (1949-08-27 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte von Helmuth Plessner, dass er die Teilnehmer seines Kollegs photographierte in einem grossen Gruppenbild. Zur zweiten Aufnahme schob er mir die Kamera ganz dicht vor das Gesicht und ich versuchte, mit weit geöffneten Augen ins Objektiv zu schauen, dessen genauen Ort ich aber hinter einer grossen, braunen Blendplatte nicht entdecken konnte. Später sagten die Leute, er hätte das zweite Mal nur mich photographiert. Erst jetzt begriff ich das und bekam einen ganz heissen Kopf. Später hielt Plessner einen soziologischen Vortrag über den Wert des Photographierens, der von den jeweiligen Zeitgenossen schwerlich begriffen würde. Erst später würde den Mangel an guten Bilddokumenten empfunden. Sodann stellte er fest, dass er bei seiner ersten Aufnahme zu weit ab, bei der zweiten zu nahe heran gegangen sei. Er entwickelte die Bilder sofort nach der Aufnahme in einer kleinen gerümpelhaften Kammer. (138 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0127 (1949-08-27 - Wittmoldt)Ich ging nächtlich durch die Bahnhofssperre und sah das Häuschen, in dem der Kontrollbeamte sass, an seinem hellerleuchteten Fenster. Der Posten wurde vertretungsweise ausgefüllt von einem Studenten. Später hatte ich diesen Dienst zu machen und entdeckte nun erst, dass das Häuschen so ungünstig gelegen sei, dass der grösste Teil der Passanten unbemerkt daran vorbeigehen konnte, da es weit vom Wege ablag. Dafür wollten viele Leute bei mir Briefmarken kaufen, als einmal ein grosser Autobus vor der Tür hielt. Ich wies sie ab, doch gab ich der Schaffnerin, die als erste kam, aus Freundlichkeit. Sie entlohnte mich dafür reich mit mehr Groschenstücken, als nötig waren, die sich jedoch später als unecht herausstellten. Ich verliess mehrmals das Häuschen, da ich das Gefühl hatte, es könne vielleicht nicht das richtige sein. Doch stellte sich der Raum, dessen Fenster direkt an die Sperre grenzten, als ein Zigarrenladen raus. Er war gut geheizt und die Leute sagten mir, dass sie auch nachts hier blieben, da sie ja keinen anderen Platz hätten. Als ich in meine Zelle zurückkam, stellte ich fest, dass in ihr nur ein schwaches, rotes Licht brannte, bei dem man kaum lesen konnte. Auch war mir bei der Anweisung der Zelle durch den Schaffner am Anfang aufgefallen, dass sich das Licht nur einschalten liess, wenn die kleine Fallklappe zum Publikum geöffnet war. Es war ein Mechanismus ähnlich wie in einer Telephonzelle. Am Ende der Nacht bemerkte ich, dass ich keine einzige Karte gelocht hatte, doch legte sich meine Betrübnis darüber bei der Überlegung, dass es nicht nötig sei, den Polizei- und Kontrollwahn noch zu stützen, der in Deutschland so verbreitet sei.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0128 (1949-08-28 - Wittmoldt)Ich schrieb im Traum die Träume dieser Nacht auf. Dann schlief ich ein und fragte träumend einen Mann nach seinen Träumen und er erzählte mir die meinen als die seinen. Erwachend nun, erzählte ich einem andern von diesem Traum von meinen Träumen. - Als ich erwacht war, hatte ich nichts gesprochen noch geschrieben, wohl aber von dem Traum im Traum - geträumt. Es war der Traum von einer grossen Reise, auf der ich Heimweh hatte und unter fremden Decken schlafen musste. Und später setzte sich dann dieser Traum fort: Da schaute ich des Morgens aus dem Fenster, und noch vom Schlaf geblendet, sah ich Wogen über Wogen und sprach davon zu meinem Bruder, obwohl ich wusste, dass er eine andere Landschaft sehen musste. Dann klärte Berg um Berg sich aus den Meereswogen ab, bis sich eine vollkommene Gipfellandschaft sah, und ich beschloss, mit meinem Bruder die Heimreise nun anzutreten. (149 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0129 (1949-08-31 - Göttingen)Ich lag auf meinem Bett und las im Don Quichote. Die kleine Sigrid spielte um mich und schliesslich wurde sie müde und legte sich neben mich und spielte Auto. Sie machte dabei solchen Krach und tobte so, dass wir schliesslich beide halb aus dem Bett fielen. Auch Emmi war im Zimmer, die immer wieder auf den besseren Don Quichote hinwies, von dem dies nur eine schlechte Ausgabe sei. (68 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0130 (1949-09-01 - Göttingen)Ich wurde auf einer Waage gewogen, die zugleich die Arbeitszeit angab, die aus dem Verhältnis von Länge und Körpergewicht ermittelt wurde. Bei mir kam eine ganz minimale Arbeitszeit heraus. Die Waage stammte aus dem vorigen Jahrhundert. 

Dann handelte es sich um Umstellungen unseres Zimmers. Mein Bruder und ich hatten aus irgendeinem Grunde den Platz unserer Betten gewechselt. An einem Morgen hatten wir beide den Wunsch, unsere Betten wieder an unseren alten Platz zu stellen, da wir beide an den altgewohnten Plätzen besser schlafen konnten. Auch Emmi spielte hierbei eine Rolle und das Ganze hatte einen Anstrich von der Erinnerung an die Möbelumstellungen in unserer Kinderzeit, die Vater gerne vornahm und die für uns immer ein grosses Ereignis waren.

Sodann las ich in einem Brief meines Bruders, in dem er sich über die Auswirkungen seiner Verlobung aussprach. Er stellte Veränderungen fest, dass er des Abends fester und bestimmter einschliefe und des Morgens sicherer wieder erwachte. Zuletzt träumte ich von einem grossen Haufen von Schuhen, aus dem ich mir ein Paar ganz leichter Sandalen heraussuchen sollte. (174 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0131 (1949-09-01 - Göttingen)Im Einschlafen träumte ich etwas über das Verhältnis des Numinosen zum Körperlichen. Ein Kandidat vertrat in einer Vorlesung die Meinung, dass jenes an dieses gebunden sein könne. Ein älterer, angesehenerer Mann, unterbrach ihn in seinem Vortrag und stellte das Eintreten dieses Falles als so unwahrscheinlich hin, dass es lächerlich wirkte und der Vortrag durch schallendes Gelächter der Zuhörer quittiert wurde. Ich erwachte und wollte mich auf die Zusammenhänge besinnen, doch waren mir die näheren Verhältnisse sogleich entfallen, obwohl sie in dem Traum sehr deutlich gewesen waren. Es handelt sich natürlich um das Erlebnis des Numinosen und seine eventuelle Gebundenheit an körperliche - unter Umständen negative Veraussetzungen, wie etwa Krankheit etc. Giselas Krankheit mag bei diesem Gedanken eine Rolle gespielt haben, auch das Wissen, dass der Zustand völliger Erschöpfung neue Bereiche des Schauens erschliesst - weiter die Begschäftigung mit dem Leib-Seele-Problem und die allmähliche Erkenntnis, dass sich aus der Gebundenheit des seelischen Erlebens an das körperliche nicht alles erklären lässt. Das trat in der Skepsis des alten Mannes hervor. Die ganze Situation hatte die Gestalt eines Seminars oder einer Art Probevorlesung. Die Figur des älteren Mannes, wohl eines Professors, war sehr deutlich. Ein breiter Mann, der die Arme etwas in die Seite stämmte. Das Gelächter, mit dem der Kanditat missverstanden wurde, ärgerte mich. (212 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0132 (1949-09-03 - Göttingen)Ich träumte von Hans-Werner B., doch in der Gestalt eines Mädchens. Wir führten ein tief verstehendes Gespräch, das seine Akzente in feinen körperlichen Berührungen erhielt. (25 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0133 (1949-09-07 - Göttingen)Ich schlief heut Nacht bei Rudolf (Rudolf Jentzsch) und träumte von Wirtinnen in allen Schattierungen, da er abends nicht gewusst hatte, ob es seiner Wirtin recht sein würde. Dann träumte ich von einem Stapel von unendlich vielen Briefen, die ich ordnen und sichten musste. Das liegt daran, dass ich gestern den ganzen Tag damit beschäftigt war, alte Briefe und Aufzeichnungen zu sortieren. 

Als Drittes träumte ich von der Räumlichkeit, in der ich schlief, doch war sie in dem Traum komplizierter und liess den Blick zum Fenster nur durch andere vorgeschaltete Räumlichkeiten frei. In Wirklichkeit hat das Zimmer einen ganz kleinen, mansardenartigen Vorbau. (102 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0134 (1949-09-08 - Göttingen)Ich schrieb einen Brief an meine Schwester und steckte ihn in den Briefkasten. Auch waren einige lose Blätter mit Aufzeichnungen dabei. Diese lösten sich beim Einstecken aus dem Packen und lagen allein im Briefkasten. Ich griff durch den Schlitz hinein, um sie wieder herauszuholen, obwohl ich wusste, dass das verboten sei. Sie wären sonst verloren gegangen, da sie keine Adresse trugen. Ich schrieb nun nicht die Anschrift in den Bergen, sondern eine neue Anschrift irgendwo im Norden dazu. Dann setzte ich mich auf die S-Bahn, um selbst gen Norden zu fahren. Als ich in den Wagen ging, sah ich ganz vorne ein Mädchen im Pelzmantel sitzen, das mir zuzunicken schien. Ich dachte es sei Gardi und setzte mich neben sie. Doch da schien mir das Mädchen fremd und ich war im Zweifel und sagte unschlüssig guten Morgen. Aus der Art, wie sie den Gruss erwiderte, erkannte ich, dass es ein fremdes Mädchen sei. Ich konnte nach vorne durch das Fenster des Führerhauses aus dem Wagen gucken in eine sehr schöne Landschaft. Hier spielte eine andere Traumszene hinein, die mich an frühere Träume erinnerte, denn ich sah vor mir einen langen Weg, entlang einer Obstplantage, dann Gras, dann eine zweite mir bekannte. Rechts des Weges Wald. Es war dieser Weg die Verbindung von einem mir unbekannten Ort, den ich auf einem grossen Spaziergang erreicht hatte, zu einem wohlbekannten, von dem ich ausgegangen war. Doch schien mir diese Verbindung denkbar kurz nach so langer Wegzeit. Auch sprach ich mit einer Frau, die ihr Kind suchte, das sich vom selben Ausgangsort spielend verirrt hatte. Und eigentlich erst im Laufe des Gespräches begriffen wir, dass wir von diesem Ort so weit nicht entfert seien, und an der Lage der einzelnen Waldhügel zueinander rekonstruierten wir den Zusammenhang der Landschaft. - Ich fuhr nun mit einer S-Bahn in diese Landschaft hinein. Es war jene andere Szene, nicht zeitlich, sondern nur in der Erinnerung, in den Gang dieses S-Bahn-Traums eingeschaltet. Als ich vor mir in den Wald starrte, wurde vom Schaffner eine Warnung ausgesprochen, nicht so weit vorne zu sitzen, wegen der Gefahr, die diese Fahrt durch den Schwarzwald mit sich brächte, da das und das direkt auf einen zukäme. Das und das war ein Berg, Wald oder Ähnliches, von dem eine urtümliche Gefahr ausging. Doch ich blieb auf meinem Platze, da ich mir überlegte, dass ja dann der Mann im Führerhaus genauso gefärdet sei, wie wir, obwohl die Insassen des Wagens mir abrieten. Da wurde mir auf einmal klar, dass ich in falscher Richtung fuhr, denn der Schwarzwald lag ja im Süden. Ich verabschiedete mich von dem etwas zweifelhaften Mädchen im Pelz und ging eilig nach hinten, doch hatte ich meine Jacke vergessen und kehrte noch einmal um. Ein kleiner Mann in einem Rollstuhl strebte schon in grosser Eile meinem Platz zu und fuhr gerade mit seinen Rädern über meine Jacke, die am Boden lag. Nur mit Mühe konnte ich sie ergreifen und an der Station den Wagen verlassen. Ich war nun in Eutin, obwohl ich in Plön gedacht hatte, in einen Zug eingestiegen zu sein, der weiter nördlich fuhr. Auch spielte Vater hier eine Rolle, der auch in jener Traumszene von den Obstplantagen vorgekommen war, indem er dort Äpfel vom Boden aufgehoben hatte, obwohl es verboten war, was mir vor den Kindern peinlich war. - Die Lage der Bahnsteige im Eutiner Bahnhof war mir schon bekannt. Als ich den Wagen verliess, sagten die Leute, dadrüben steht sicher der andere Zug. Ich sah am Ende des Bahnsteigs einen andern in senkrechter Richtung dazu sich erstreckenden und dort verschiedene Züge und Wagen, darunter auch einen Triebwagen, der mir der richtige erschien. Auch sah ich, wie ein Bahnsteighäuschen sich bewegte, das in diesem modernen Bahnhof ebenfalls elektrisch gezogen wurde, mit den selben Antriebsmitteln wie die S-Bahn. Während ich mit meinem schweren Koffer dem Wagen in grosser Eile zustrebte, fiel mir ein, dass die Verbindung von hier nach Plön laut Vaters Erzählungen sehr umständlich und mit vielem Umsteigen und Warten verbunden sein müsse, obwohl mir das sehr merkwürdig schien, nachdem ich dieselbe Strecke in der anderen Richtung so schnell und mühelos zurückgelegt hatte. Ich dachte darüber nach, wie hoffnungslos schwer es ist, das Versäumte einzuholen, wenn man im Anfang die richtige Richtung verfehlt hat. Ich gab nun auf, das Fest noch zu erreichen. - Meine Koffer durch die Strassen tragend, begegnete mir die Frau von vorhin, die nun ihr Reiseziel erreicht hatte. Sie war in Begleitung einiger Herren, die ihre Koffer trugen, und ich grüsste sie von hinten an ihr vorbei kommend. Da ihre Begleiter gerade hier ihre Koffer absetzten, war ich zwischen ihnen und der Hauswand eingeklemmt und konnte die paar Schritte bis zu meiner Wohnung, die ich zum Einstecken der Briefe verlassen hatte, nicht zurücklegen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0135 (1949-09-08 - Göttingen)Ich beschaute mit Ika die Auslagen eines Kunstgewerbegeschäftes. Ich vertiefte mich in die Bilder Dürers und Albrecht Altdorfers. Sie hatte ihre Freude an einigen schönen Schalen und an vertrockneten Kuchen, die seit langem darin ausgestellt waren und bunte Farben angenommen hatten. Auch manch andere Bilder nahmen wir in uns auf, so eine Schar ganz kleiner Kinder, die auf winzigen Motorrädern uns entgegenkamen. Ich packte sie manchmal im Eifer des Gespräch am Arm und nannte sie aus Versehen Du. Anschliessend entschuldigte ich mich dann immer. 

In einer zweiten Traumszene begegnete ich nachts in dunkler Strasse einem dicken Herren, mit grossem, kreissägenförmigen Strohhut. Er trat einige Schritte zurück, erhob seinen Arm und ich sah in seiner Hand die Mündung eines Revolvers erscheinen. Ich warf mich zu Boden, um dem Schuss zu entgehen. Und während ich noch auf dem Rücken lag und zappelte, sagte er "Darf ich eine Aufnahme von Ihnen machen?" und starrte mich etwas fassungslos an über mein Gebahren. Ich wollte es kaum glauben, dass es nur eine Kamera sei, was er in der Hand hielt. (175 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0137 (1949-09-08 - Göttingen)Der Tag schloss sich aus Vormittag und Nachmittag wie eine grosse Acht zusammen, die völlig in sich selbst zurücklief, und beide, die sonst ins Endlose tendierten, hielten sich das Gleichgewicht. Diese Art, wie die Glieder des Traums in die Waage kommen, ist der Einschlag, mit dem das Erwachen in die Dynamik des Traums einspielt und sie bei einer endgültigen Form festhält. 

Erst später leuchtete mir wieder ein, was vormittags und nachmittags geschehen war. Und so konnte ich aus dem Schema dieses Traums seinen Inhalt wieder finden. Ich machte am Vormittag einen grossen Spaziergang mit Margund. Wir stiegen auf den Hügel von Nikolausberg und waren alleine in der alten Kirche. Wir lebten völlig zeit- und sorgenlos und liessen die Bilder der Landschaft auf uns wirken. Am Nachmittage aber war ich bei Gisela und manches Reifende war in Schwermut und Trauer gehüllt.

Diese war in verschiedene Gruppen nach verschiedenen Arbeitsgebieten eingeteilt. Ich trug mich unter dem Namen Eduard Spranger ein. Als gemeinsamen Obertitel las ich "Seelsorge und Leben" oder ähnlich. Hartmann nannte manchmal meinen Namen. Er hielt mich für in Holstein auf dem Lande eingesessen. Einmal wollte er einen Satz von mir zu Ende gesprochen haben. Ich sagte, dass ich es nicht könne, da ich mich gerade mit der Liste beschäftigt hatte. (87 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0139 (1949-09-11 - Göttingen)Ich träumte heute Nacht von meiner Tante und einer Nähmaschinennadel. Denn hier besass ich eine sehr komplette und, da sie keine hatte, wollte ich meine leihen. Die Nadel war mit ausschraubbarer Spitze und überaus stark und sehr manierlich. Die Tante war verwundert und beschämt ob solcher Gabe. 

Fortsetzung am 12.9.1949 (139a): Ich wachte eben aus meinen Träumen auf mit dem geheimnisvollen Gefühl, mich selbst geweckt zu haben. Ich sprach das amerikanische Wort clay vor mich hin und fuhr mit einem gewissen Erschrecken aus dem Schlaf. Ich entsinne mich, dass in den Träumen meine frühere Wirtin eine Rolle spielte. Sie war von einer Reise zurückgekehrt und ihr Reisegepäck in unserem Zimmer abgestellt. Ich fand in ihrer Reisetasche einen Stapel von Briefen, die ich vor langer Zeit an sie geschrieben hatte, und wunderte mich, wie eine alte Frau so an mir hängen könne. (141 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0140 (1949-09-13 - Göttingen)Ich träumte von Christian, er sei doch noch aus dem Bergwerk zurückgekehrt. Ich traf ihn in der Post. Er legte den Kopf an meine Schulter und machte eine Gebärde des Sinnes: Du hast doch recht gehabt, und sagte: Die Arbeit war doch zu schwer. Er sprach von Novalis-abenden, die er dort mitgemacht hätte. 

Vorher träumte ich von Nicolai Hartmann. Wir sassen in einer Stube beieinander und führten lange Gespräche tiefen Einverständnisses. Zu unseren Themen gehörte das Problem, dass im Gemeinschaftsleben der Menschen das Wissen um die richtigen Kategorien zur zureichenden Einsicht in die Komplexheit seiner Zusammenhänge noch sehr mangelhaft sei, und dass infolge dessen die Kurzsichtigkeit allen Handels auf diesem Gebiet noch gross wäre.

Auch auf anderen Gebieten zeigte sich eine grosse Übereinstimmung der Ansichten. Zuletzt erzählte uns Hartmann ein Märchen. Da kam ein Kriegsheimkehrer hinzu, der ihn unterbrach und verbesserte, da er das Märchen besser kannte. Da klatschte Hartmann zur Anerkennung leise, und nur beinahe angedeutet, in die Hände. Übrigens ist es sehr interessant, woraus sich die Gestalt Hartmanns in dem Traum entwickelt hat. Es war ein Hauslehrer, den man auf einem Gut angenommen hatte, ein über 90-jähriger Mann, der wie ein Einsiedler gekleidet war, aber noch grosse Rüstigkeit zeigte. Später stellte ich fest, dass es ein jüngerer Mann war, der sich aus Tarnungsgründen verkleidet hatte. Während der langen Gespräche nahm er allmählich die Züge Hartmanns an. Zuletzt lief das Gespräch in eine Prüfungssituation aus. (236 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0141 (1949-09-13 - Göttingen)Ich fand im Traum mein Zimmer merkwürdig verändert. Möbelstücke standen in anderen Abständen und an anderen Stellen, als ich gewohnt war. Ich konnte mich nicht besinnen, sie umgestellt zu haben, tastete mit den Fingern nach, um zu sehen, ob ich mich nicht täusche. Schliesslich kam ich zu dem Schluss, dass ich im Traume sein müsste. Doch gelang es mir nicht, den Bann zu durchbrechen. Da merkte ich, wie ich eben ein Möbelstück an einer Stelle gesehen und sogar seine Schubladen geöffnet habe, an der zu stehen es ganz unmöglich Platz haben konnte. Ich war nun gewiss, im Traum zu sein und beschloss, ins helle Licht des Fensters zu sehen, um zu erwachen. Ich tat dies und erwachte sofort, obwohl in der Richtung, in die ich meine Augen aufgeschlagen hatte, gar kein Fenster war. Auch erstaunte ich sehr, dass ich mich in meinem Bett befand und meine Lage im Zimmer mit der Orientierung im Traum gar keine Ähnlichkeit hatte. Das äusserst Merkwürdige ist, dass ich in diesem Traum ein ganz klares Bewusstsein hatte, zu träumen, und diese Tatsache sogar logisch aus der Ungereimtheit der Raumverhältnisse und der Raumausfüllung durch die Gegenstände erschloss. Ich bemerkte direkt, dass mir meine Kommode nur in der Form eines Bildes erschienen war, weil an der Stelle, an der ich sie gesehen und sogar ihre Schubladen handelnd geöffnet hatte, in Wirklichkeit gar nicht genug Raum war; ich tastete auch mit den Händen sorgfältig die leergebliebene Stelle ab, an der sie eigentlich stehen musste, und doch konnte ich den Bann des Traumes nicht durchbrechen, ehe ich nicht von dem Ins-Licht-Schauen geträumt hatte, das zum Erwachen führt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0142 (1949-09-13 - Göttingen)Heute zwischen Wachen und Träumen fiel mir ein, dass ein Weg in meinen Träumen eine grosse Rolle spielt, den ich 1946 in Eutin ging, wenngleich er noch nie bis in jenes Bewusstsein hineingelangt ist, in dem man die Träume aufschreiben kann. Es ist der Weg um den Kellersee. Dort gibt es in dem Städtchen Malente ein Wegstückchen, das einen vom Ufer abführt. Ich versuchte, an den See zurückzukommen, und verirrte mich in Strassen und Gartenwege, aus denen ich erst allmählich wieder herausfand. Überhaupt hat jener Gang einen tiefen Eindruck auf mich gemacht. So dass klassizistische Haus, das dort inmitten hoher Wälder in bewunderungswürdiger Heiterkeit am Ufer liegt. Ein kleines Tempelchen liegt am Gartenrand schon halb im Wasser. Dort blieb ich eine Weile und schaute wechselnd auf den See hinaus und auf das Haus zurück. Dann verliess ich den Park und kam bald zwischen Herden hindurch in das Dorf und zum Uhleier Fährhaus. (152 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0143 (1949-09-14 - Göttingen)"Wo Ruinen fehlen, da ist Museum", so sprach in meinem Traum ein alter, beleibter Herr, der auf seinem Sonntagsspaziergang vor dem Haus stehen geblieben war und in die Fenster schaute. Er trug noch einen feierlichen, schwarzen Rock mit glänzender Weste und eine schwarze Fliege. An die Beine hatte er schon die bequemeren grauen Hosen gezogen. Er sprach die sinnierenden Worte zu seiner Frau und liess das Gespräch dann ins Biologische übergehen, doch immer noch im belehrenden Ton. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0146 (1949-10-02 - Wittmoldt)Ich träumte heute nacht in vielen Bildern, die alle darauf hinausliefen, dass Leuten, die in Bedrängnis waren, finanziell geholfen werden sollte und dass ich das nicht für mich in Anspruch zu nehmen wagte. Zuerst ging ich, mir einen Hut zu kaufen. Doch alle hatten nicht die richtige Form. Dann wollte ich meine goldene Uhr in Ordnung bringen lassen. Doch der Uhrmacher wollte sie sogleich reinigen und einen hohen Preis dafür nehmen (9 Mark). Ich weigerte mich, da ich kein Geld hätte. Da kam eine Frau angelaufen mit einem Zettel, den ich ausfüllen solle. Es könne an Menschen in grosser finanzieller Not, die sich nicht mehr zu helfen wüssten, eine Summe von 10 DM vom Roten Kreuz ausgezahlt werden. Ich musste es ablehnen, denn ohne goldene Uhr kann man leben. Aber ich erhielt solche Zettel, um eventuell anderen helfen zu können. Sofort danach kam eine Frau in Bedrängnis. Sie hatte eine Tür zugeschlagen und kam nun aus dem Raum, in dem sie eingesperrt war, nicht mehr heraus. Ich musste ihr von aussen öffnen. Dann ging ich durch die Strassen und überlegte, wie man, bei kriegerischer Gefahr in die Häuser kommen würde, auch wenn die Eingangstüren an den Vorderfronten versperrt seien. Es war in Schwerin in der Werderstrasse vor Muddings Haus (jene Strasse, in der ich mich als Kind oft mit dem Gedanken beschäftigte, wie es wäre, wenn ein böser Geist hier nur Kulissen anstatt Häusern vor mir aufgebaut hätte). Es wurden nun viele Auswege von einem Passanten vorgeschlagen. Ein schmaler Gang, der auf die Höfe führte, über die Dächer laufen etc. Zuletzt war ich auf einem hohen Berg auf der Terrasse eines Ausflugslokals. Dort hatte ein geschäftstüchtiger Mann eine Radfahrerausleihe eingerichtet und gab durch einen Lautsprecher den Leuten Anweisungen zum Radfahren lernen. - Auch hatte er einen Erfrischungsraum sehr modern eingerichtet. Ich sah die Kuchen im Fenster doch konnte sie mir nicht kaufen. Sie waren zu teuer. Am nächsten Tag ging ich in das Lokal, um die Aussicht zu geniessen. Doch es regnete. Man konnte keine Berge sehen. Ich fragte den Ober "Haben Sie etwas zu essen?" - "Ja, eine Tasse Kaffee können Sie haben oder Gerundetes" - "Was ist das? den Namen kenne ich nicht" - er zeigte mir eine bregenartige Masse (Wir assen gestern Bregen). "Preis?" - "9 Mark". Alle anderen Preise waren ähnlich. "Nein, das kann ich nicht, ich habe kein Geld". Ich wollte aufstehen. Aber der Ober sagte "Ja, wenn Sie eben kein Geld haben, dann müssen wir es ihnen umsonst geben. Wir müssen eben keine Rechnung ausstellen". Ich wollte etwas dagegen sagen, aber er erwiderte, sie täten das schon, wenn auch hier ja eigentlich nicht der richtige Ort für einen wäre, wenn man kein Geld hätte. Aber ich konnte es nicht annehmen, denn nebenan war ja das Jugendberghaus, in dem meine Schwester wohnte, bei der ich bequem hätte essen können. (474 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0147 (1949-10-12 - Wittmoldt)Gespräch mit Dieter (Dieter Kruse) über meine hiesige Arbeit. - Er sagt, man habe es moniert, ich habe meine Arbeit auf den Terrassen (so statt Vorplätzen) des Hauses unterbrochen. Ich erwidere, da mir das sehr peinlich ist, solchen Vorwurf zu hören, ich sei zwar ein langsamer Arbeiter, aber ich habe stetig gearbeitet. 

2. Traumszene: Ich esse mit einer Person, die auch Züge von Vater trägt, Früchtepudding (Die Früchte haben Ähnlichkeit mit Fliederbeeren oder Rosinen). Am Boden der Schüssel ist der Pudding angebrannt. Ich denke, mein Vater wolle nicht zum zweiten Mal essen - wegen des Angebrannten. Er will es aber doch und ich gebe ihm von meinem Teller wieder ab, obwohl mir das peinlich ist - aber ich habe viel weicheres, saftiges, noch nicht angebranntes auf meinem Teller, von dem ich ihm geben kann.

3. Traumszene: Ich bin in einem Krankenwagen (Selbstfahrer für Gehbehinderte). Während ich die Reste von meinem Teller aufesse, bekomme ich das Angebrannte in den Mund. Ich spucke es heimlich aus. Es fängt an zu regnen und, da mich mein Bruder gezwungen hat, mit dem Krankenwagen aus dem Schuppen auf den freien Platz (Es ist der Ziegenmarkt in Schwerin) zu fahren, werde ich nass. Aber ich bleibe in passiver Resistenz einfach sitzen. Mein Bruder ruft mir immer wieder zu, ich solle aufstehen. Schliesslich tue ich es und gehe auf ein Haus zu (Es ist die Drogerie Gerard) und dann weiter in die Richtung Amtstrasse (Dort war früher auch meine Schule - der Weg führte durch sie und Ziegenmarkt-Münzstrasse auch zu Mudding Schultz, von wo ich Hichi (Maria Reichardt) oft in der gefährlichen Russenzeit heimbrachte). Als ich mich umsehe, ist der Krankenwagen weg. Ich laufe verzweifelt hinterher und sehe ihn in einem Hauseingang in der Münzstrasse verschwinden. Dort hole ich den Dieb ein, als der Wagen gerade, von einem Auto gezogen, in einer Garagentür (oder ähnlichem) verschwunden ist. Ich sammle mich im Hingehen. Und sage sehr bestimmt: Geben Sie sofort meinen Wagen her. Der Mann sagt ganz unverholen, dass er den Wagen brauche als Kastenwagen. - Da sehe ich zwei Polizeibeamten auf dem Hof, kutschierend auf dem Bock eines Pferdewagens. Ich rufe sofort: Polizei, zu Hilfe, obwohl der eine Beamte einen Generalsstern trägt, so dass ich in Zweifel komme, ob es überhaupt Polizisten sind. Aber sie tragen beide ganz einfache Schulterstücke. Sie kommen freundlich zur Hilfe, doch als ich den Dieb neben mir überführen will, trägt er auf einmal auch Polizeiuniform. Ich sage: der hat sich nur maskiert, und will ihm den Chacho vom Kopf stossen (den er trägt, während die andern ja nur Mützen haben). Ich sage auch, er habe unter seinem Mantel nur Zivil an. - Doch er knöpft sofort den Mantel auf und zeigt eine alte, abgegriffene Polizeijacke. Ich sage "So, Sie haben sich geschickt maskiert" und erwache. (463 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0149 (1949-11-10 - Göttingen)Gespräche mit Hartmann über die Totalitätskategorie. Ich sagte: "Sie ist nicht nur die Summe, sondern die Ganzheit der Bestimmungstsücke". Er sagte: "Ja, so kommt es heraus." (26 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0150 (1949-11-10 - Göttingen)In einem grossen Treppenhaus ein Bernhardinerhund. Ich habe, wie vor allen Hunden im Traum, Angst, von ihm gebissen zu werden, doch nicht so stark als sonst, denn es ist ja ein Bernhardinerhund und diese gelten doch als besonders treu. Zuletzt will ich aus der Haustür gehen und schiebe den Hund mit aller Gewalt am Kopf zurück, da er mir folgen will, ich aber weiss, dass er im Haus bleiben soll. 

Einmal knackt schon die Tür im Schloss, während ich sehe, dass er immer noch seine Pfote hinausstreckt, ich muss also die Tür wieder öffnen und der Vorgang des Zurückdrängens setzte sich noch lange fort, bis seine Herrin kam und den Hund zurückhielt. (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0151 (1949-11-13 - Göttingen)Sehr interessante Träume von Nicolai Hartmann und Ernst Jünger. Ihn besuchte ich in seinem Haus in einer kleinen, winkligen Stadt. Er war gross und dick, ganz anders, als ich ihn mir vorgestellt hatte. Zwei Hunde hatte er. Einer sah sehr fürstlich aus wie eine Spanierin mit in der Mitte gescheitelten Haaren und von langsamer Bewegung. Der andere hatte ein schmales Gesicht und einen Hahnenkamm und wirkte doch damit sehr effeminiert. Bei Hartmann war ein Seminar, in dem seine Bücher gelesen wurden. Neben mir sass ein Ausländer, der den selben Text auf Englisch geschrieben hatte und schlecht übersetzen konnte, denn es handelte sich um eine Stelle, die in volkstümlichem Deutsch und mit Apostrophierungen geschrieben war. 

Später ein Fest in einer grossen, gotischen Kirche. Die Menschen wurden bald betrunken und benahmen sich sehr komisch. Hartmann besass auch einen Automaten, aus dem man Schokolade holen konnte. Ein Mädchen schloss sich mit mir in eine kleine Kammer ein. Sie hatte etwas Leuchtendes in ihrem Gesicht wie Feeli und etwas Packendes in ihren Bewegungen wie Gisela. Das lag daran, dass sie mit mir allein sein wollte, den ein Betrunkener verfolgte uns und wollte uns einen grossen Teller mit Sauce über den Anzug giessen. Der Schokoladenautomat war übrigens bald leer und dann erschien eine leuchtende Aufschrift auf seinem Schild mit dem Wort "Steril". Ich hatte zuletzt drei Tafeln auf einmal mit einem Groschen bekommen, doch hatte ein schlechtes Gewissen und warf die beiden anderen Groschen noch nach. Nicolai Hartmann hatte auch einen Autobus, um uns alle zu fahren, in dem er selbst am Steuer sass. Später sah ich Autobusse und Strassenbahnen und Lastwagen, die sich ganz dicht auf der verkehrsreichen Strasse begegneten, ohne sich zu schrammen. (280 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0152 (1949-11-14 - Göttingen)Träume aus dem Irrenhaus. Ich werde dort zur Beobachtung eingeliefert. Frau v.Bülow kühlt mir die Stirn, um das Schlimmste zu verhüten. Sie befürchtet bei mir wohl die gleiche Krankheit wie bei Vater (Ateriosklerose). Ich sage ihr, dass ich dazu noch zu jung sei. Dann Aufenthalt in der Anstalt. Der Anstaltsleiter schläft in einem Lederstuhl (Es ist der kleine Sessel, der zu Hause bei uns neben dem Radio steht, in dem Vater immer Mittagsschlaf hielt). Die andern halten Mittagsschlaf auf dem Fussboden. Einer sieht im Halbwachen mich dort stehen und macht mir Platz auf seiner Decke. Ich lege mich neben ihn und denke: Dies wird also jetzt dein Kamerad sein, denn er hat sich als erster um dich bekümmert. Allmählich geht die Handlung des Traums in eine Geschichte über eine solche Untersuchung über, die ich in einem Kinderbuch lese und später gleichzeitig als Film sehe und teilweise in der Rolle des Helden der Geschichte, eines kleinen Jungen, selbst erlebe. - Zunächst lese ich, obwohl es im Zimmer schon so dunkel ist, dass man fast nichts mehr sehen kann (Ich sitze vor der Balkontür in Muttis Zimmer in Schwerin) und probiere nun die Experimente, die man zur Untersuchung des Jungen anstellt, an mir selbst aus. Zunächst muss er die Augen schliessen und eine Ärztin nähert sich ihm mit den Händen und fragt ihn, ob seine Hände warm seien. Dabei hat sie aber eine Zigarette in der Hand und brennt ihn damit an den Händen, so dass er natürlich sagt: Warm. Ich schreie dazwischen und sage: So könne man das Experiment nicht machen. Später las ich ein Ereignis, wo direkt vor den Augen des Jungen ein Schiff auseinanderbirst. Danach sah ich dasselbe Bild in einem Bilderheft zur Illustration der Geschichte. - Im Laufe des Traumes sage ich auch einmal zu einem Kapitän, der viele Querfalten auf der Stirne hat, dass dies ein Zeichen der Hysterie sei. Er sagt: "Haben Sie etwa keine Querfalten?" - "Doch freilich", sage ich. - Die Geschichte von dem Jungen ist eine Fortsetzungsgeschichte und endet jedesmal so, dass er irrtümlich doch wieder für wahnsinnig gehalten wird. Zuletzt soll ich Zentnersäcke auf ein Schiff vor der Balkontür laden und weigere mich, weil sie zu schwer sind. (366 words)

Ein Gebirge seitlich der Stadt macht das Überfliegen unmöglich. Die Landkarte täuscht, da in Wahrheit zwei Städte (Hannover und Burgdorf) in eine zusammengewachsen sind. Dann Traum vom Blindflug und vom Orientierungsflug über ein Gebirge. Zuletzt Erzählungen von einem Flieger über dem Bodensee, der seine Beine heraushängen liess, um sie ins Wasser zu tauchen und dabei hineinfiel. Gedanke: Er brauchte doch nicht zu ertrinken, er konnte ja schwimmen. Dann die Vorstellung, wie der Flieger über dem See Kurven machen muss, um nicht gegen die Berge zu fliegen. (103 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0154 (1949-11-16 - Göttingen)Ein Fuchs springt mich auf der Strasse an wie ein Hund. Ich habe irgendeinen Gegenstand in der Hand, den ich vor ihm retten will. Er nimmt das für ernst und ich werd' ihn nun nicht mehr los. Er folgt mir schliesslich in ein Haus. In einer Mischung von Glück und Angst habe ich ihn auf dem Arm und spiele mit ihm. Zuletzt laufe ich wahnsinnig schnell die Treppenstufen herunter und schlage die Tür hinter mir zu, sodass der Fuchs drinnen eingesperrt bleibt. Dann um viele Strassenecken, damit er mich nicht wiederfindet. Dabei einmal Gedanke: Was wird nun mit dem Fuchs passieren. - Später ging es in Strassenträume über. Eine Strassenbahn fährt ab. Verschiedene Menschen sitzen darin, von denen ich einige kennen sollte und nicht wiedererkannt habe. (126 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0155 (1949-11-17 - Göttingen)Träumte von vielen Strassen, in denen ich mich nicht zurechtfinden konnte. Dann sah ich einen Menschenauflauf. Ein Mann röchelte wie ein Erstochener. Dann hörte man ein Kind wie ein Neugeborenes schreien und sah eine Frau in Ohnmacht fallen. Andere Menschen eilten zur Hilfe. Ich suchte meinen Weg durch eine Seitengasse. Ich hatte einen Stapel Zeitungen, die ich zu einem Verwandten tragen musste, für den ich auch eine Weinkiste geschickt bekommen hatte. Ich ging zu Gisela und fragte sie, ob sie mein verlorenes Geld gefunden hatte. Sie hatte die Hälfte gefunden und schenkte mir die andere. Ich war sehr beglückt. Später lag ich zuhause im Bett und bemühte mich, mich auf meine Träume zu besinnen und sie aufzuschreiben. Ich reckte mich aus, um die Kerze auf dem Nachttisch anzuzünden. Doch stand statt ihrer eine Weinflasche da, an deren Hals ich mit dem brennenden Streichholz entlangglitt, bis ich merkte, dass hinter ihr der Leuchter stand, in welchem nun eine rote Kerze steckte, die ich anzündete mit dem Gedanken, mein Bruder müsse sie hineingesteckt haben. Dann sah ich die grosse Standuhr (die auf dem Flur steht) vor meinem Bett stehen und bemühte mich, die Zeit abzulesen. Es war schon zwanzig Minuten nach Acht. Später war sie fort und ich erkannte das Bild als ein Traumbild. Mein Bruder sagte, er habe sie auch gesehen und ich fragte ihn, ob er sie von seinem Bett in einem schrägen Winkel gesehen habe, da ich sie ja aus dem meinen frontal sah. Er bestätigte es und ich sah damit ihre Realität bewiesen. Ich tastete mit geschlossenen Augen die Stelle ab und fühlte sofort einen Gegenstand. Aber es war nicht die Uhr sondern eine Weinkiste. Hiernach brauchte ich noch lange bis zum vollen Erwachen. (286 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0156 (1949-12-03 - Göttingen)Träumte heute nacht von lauter Doppelgängern und dann, wie ich Gisela und Margund davon erzählte. Zuerst waren es zwei Doppelgänger meines Bruders, die in meine Stube kamen und meinen Schrank ausplündern wollten. Nach einer Zeit gelang es mir, sie zu bändigen. Ich würgte sie und warf sie auf die rote Decke meines Bettes. Dann zwang ich sie beide nacheinander, mir ihr Profil zu zeigen, damit ich den Doppelgänger von meinem echten Bruder unterscheiden könne. Doch beide hatten eine Hakennase und waren also beide unecht. Später kam mein Bruder selbst. - Bald darauf kam eine Frau, die sich als Frau v.Uslar vorstellte. Ich erkannte bald, dass sie nicht echt war, doch sagte nichts, da ich sie gerne mochte und im Laufe der Zeit sogar mit dem Gedanken spielte, sie zu heiraten. Zuletzt kam ein Doppelgänger meines Onkels Gerd aus Hamburg. Wir standen auf dem Flur und, als ich entsetzt ausrief, es sei ein Dieb oder ein Betrüger, nahm ein kleiner Junge, der dort stand, einen Revolver und schoss ihn tot, ohne dass ich diese voreilige Handlung verhindern konnte. 

Gisela träumte heute nacht von einem Pferd, mit dem sie über die Dächer der Stadt reiten konnte.

4.12.1949. Am Vormittag, nachdem ich dieses schrieb, erfuhr ich, dass mein Onkel Gerd am 1.12. sich durch Gift das Leben nahm. Ich wusste, dass er sich mit diesem Gedanken trug, hatte jedoch wochenlang nicht mehr daran gedacht. Ich erfuhr es durch Onkel Adolf, der am Vormittag des 3.12. hierher reiste und es uns beiden bei der Gelegenheit mitteilte. - Das Traumbild von dem Revolver mag aus einer Erzählung Onkel Gerds stammen, als ich ihn das letzte Mal im August besuchte. Es handelte sich um ein Mädchen, dass sich vor langem mit einem Revolver erschossen hatte. (289 words)

Wir winkten zunächst vergeblich. Dann an einer Ecke, die der Greenhouse-Partie in Schwerin glich. Ein kleines, offenes Sportauto. Ein Herr in altmodischer Kleidung sagte: "Jedem erzähle ich, dass dem Wagen Nummer 9 verboten ist, Menschen mitzunehmen". Dann liess er uns einsteigen. Alle hatten Platz bis auf mich. Gisela war in ein Gespräch vertieft und achtete nicht auf mich. Ich rief empört ihren Namen und schlug ihr mit einem Buch auf den Arm. Sie drehte sich langsam und sehr bestimmt um und sagte: Was fällt Dir eigentlich ein. Ich erwägte im Erwachen, ob ich auf den Hacken Kehrt machen sollte oder nicht. (151 words)

Besonders prägten sich mir die Züge eines sehr gut aussehenden englischen Leutnants mit schwarzen gewellten Haaren ein. Vor dem Hause stand ein englischer Tank und später kam ein grünes Postauto. Als wir in dieses einstiegen und schon ein Stück gefahren waren, sahen wir, wie das Flugzeug immer niedriger ging, um eine Notlandung zu versuchen. Ich stieg aus dem Postauto aus, um schnell dorthin zu laufen, und auch der Tank setzte sich in Bewegung. Doch kam ich zu Fall und konnte dem Tank nicht mehr ausweichen.

Einmal war ich mit dem Schädel gegen einen Laternenpfahl gerannt, dass es einen dumpfen, dröhnenden Klang gab, bei dem ich mir des ganzen Unheils bewusst wurde, mit jener erschlaffenden Gleichgültigkeit des Entsetztens, die das Geschehene nicht mehr rückgängig machen kann und doch zu einer richtigen Stellungnahme noch nicht fähig ist. Einmal hörte ich es drei Mal klingeln, während ich gerade beim Umziehen war, und schickte Gisela schnell zum Aufmachen hinaus. Einmal hörte ich die Stimmen meines Bruders und seines Freundes hereinkommen und konnte weder mich vom Bett erheben, noch die Augen öffnen. - Manchmal sann ich langen, bei wachem Betrachten völlig sinnlosen Sätzen nach, die alle im Stile Schleiermachers gebildetet waren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0175 (1950-02-16 - Göttingen)Spielt vor einem Schaufenster einer Strasse und in einem Laden, der zugleich Polizeiwache ist. Auf der Strasse vor dem Schaufenster ein Taschendieb - wenigstens glaube ich, es sei ein solcher, denn er greift nach meiner Brieftasche, wie es scheint. Ich bewirke seine Festnahme durch vorbeikommende Soldaten, indem ich laut rufe "Taschendieb". Er wird abgeführt. Der vorangehende Soldat hat einen Stahlhelm auf. Er aber entkommt. Ich sage: "Die Stümper". Dann Gang in die Polizeiwache. Gespräch mit den Frauen hinter dem Ladentisch über das Frauliche und über die Kraft, die im Leben trägt. Die Frau greift das Reiten bei Frauen an. Ich verteidige es. (Gisela). Später merke ich, dass ich vor dem Schaufenster einen fremden Hut ergriffen habe, der mir gar nicht gehört. Meinen eigenen hatte ich trotzdem noch. Ich überlege, wie ich ihn seinem Besitzer wieder zustellen kann. (Hier wohl leichtes Erwachen). Dann Heimweg mit Henning und Gisela auf einem schmalen, serpentinenartigen Bergweg, der aber mit Gittern versehen ist. Ich gehe bequem mit Henning voran. Gisela aber kommt nicht nach. Ich drehe mich um und schaue auf den Weg unter mir mit dem Gedanken, mit offenen Armen hinab, ihr entgegen laufen zu müssen. Dann Erwachen mit dem Gedanken, ich müsste sie auf den Schultern hinauftragen. Gefühl der Beglückung. (207 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0177 (1950-02-17 - Göttingen)Im Bergwerk. Der Schacht ist durch irgendeine Katastrophe versoffen. Ich stehe auf einem wackligen Brett und versenke an einem grossen Strick ein Bündel Papier ins Wasser, bis es tief unter den Gewässern die Region des Feuers erreicht, um es dann hochzuziehen und damit die Stichflamme an die Oberfläche zu locken. Es ist ein Spiel mit dem Feuer, doch die Reinigung des Schachtes gelingt. Die Flamme schlägt durch, ohne mich zu verzehren. Es ist sehr reizvoll, die blauen Flämmchen auf der Fläche des Wassers erscheinen zu sehen. - Später im Aufenthaltsraum der Bergleute. Urtümliche, fast hölzerne, bärtige Gesichter. Zum Teil mit schielenden Augen. Ein Konglomerat aller Ausgestossenen der Welt. Dort herrscht eine merkwürdige Grusssitte. Die Kumpels reichen sich die Hand und schlagen sich dann selbst mit der eigenen Hand eine Ohrfeige. Ein Angehöriger einer südlichen Bevölkerungsgruppe kommt herein mit diesem Gruss und bekreuzigt sich dann feierlich. Nächste Szene: Ein Bad in den Gewässern, die aus dem Schacht ausgetreten sind. Zunächst beschäftige ich mich wieder mit dem Versenken eines Stricks in der Tiefe. Diesmal hängt ein Eimer daran. Doch die Badenden verschieben die Bretter, gefährden meinen Standpunkt und machen das Unternehmen unmöglich. - Zuletzt eine Diskussion in bergmännischen Kreisen. Daran beteiligt ein Junge mit Samtbarret. Später derselbe mit seinem jüngeren Bruder am Klavier. Beide sehen reizend aus. Sehr selbstbewusst mit ihren Samtkappen im holsteinischen Stil. Darunter volles, kräftiges Haar, zurückgekemmt und dabei etwas hochgebauscht (ähnlich wie auf dem Bild von Margunds Bruder). Sie spielen ein barockes, sehr heiteres Stück, das in jedem Part mit drei hellen, glockenartigen Tönen beginnt. Doch können sie sich nicht ganz einigen. Der Kleinere ist etwas lebhafter und impulsiver, der Grosse verhaltener und bedächtiger. Später sehe ich mich mit meinem Bruder im Kinderzimmer in Schwerin. Ich werde von den Erinnerungen überwältigt und muss weinen. Doch als ich erwache, schäme ich mich des Weinens. (305 words)

Ich bleibe standhaft und kaufe nur zwei Mohnbrötchen (Same aus dem gegenwärtigen Leben) und erkundige mich nach einem Mittagstisch. Ein solcher sei in der Carlstrasse (Hamburg, Nähe Onkel Gerds), die von der Friedrichstrasse (Göttingen bei der Aula) abgeht. Ich biege in die Friedrichstrasse ein. Den Schupo an der Kreuzung sehe ich gerade noch in einer Verkehrspause im Polizeiauto abfahren. Er hat nichts mehr zu tun. Schlendernd gerate ich in eine Nebenstrasse. Dort sitzt in einem Fenster ein nacktes Mädchen, jung und etwas braungebrannt. Sie sagt, sie sei erhängt worden und dann dort in die Fensternische gesetzt. Sie ist aber lebendig. Ich lege den Arm um sie und ziehe sie zu mir hinab. So geht sie festgehalten neben mir her. Nur scheu und flüchtig berühre ich einmal ihre Brüste. Ich erzähle ihr, dass ich die Carlstrasse gesucht hätte, das sei jetzt aber egal. Da sehe ich ein Strassenschild mit der Aufschrift Cellerstrasse (Dort wohnt Margund) und erwache. (190 words)

Gisela will dort hinauf, weil sie im indischen Stil gebaut ist. - Der Traum ging hervor aus einem anderen, in dem mich Krischan (Christian) auf einem Umweg in den schon geschlossenen Katalogsaal der Universitätsbibliothek führen will. Viele Stufen tastend hinab in einem völlig dunkeln Kellertreppenhaus, das ich nicht kenne und in dem ich ihm kaum zu folgen vermag. Dann wird die Tür ins Helle aufgestossen und wir stehen verwundert an ganz anderer Stelle im Schloss- oder Burghof. Hier Übergang in den Traum mit Gisela und den aufsteigenden Wendeltreppen. - Ein Arbeiter hat uns den Schlüssel gegeben. Die breiten Treppen vermeiden wir, um nicht vor die Absperrungskordeln der Museumsverwaltung zu geraten. - Vom Hofe aus sahen wir die Kuppel und auch zwei andere vergoldete Bekrönungen. Die eine, eine Art goldener Aussichtskuppel, in der man die Leute Karrusselfahren sieht. - Ein Gang durch den Burggarten sollte uns an das richtige Treppenhaus bringen. Einmal teilt sich der Weg in zwei Brücken. Die eine aus Stein, dammartig aufgeschichtet, die andere hölzern, etwas morsch. Ich wähle den Weg über die erste. Doch sie ist sehr schmal und glitschig und erst allmählich kann ich mich vergewissern, dass sie auch wirklich zum Ziel führt, hingegen sehe ich, dass die andere den einfacheren und kürzeren Weg bildet und auf einen breiten Kiesweg hinausführt. Ich rufe Gisela zu, dort zu gehen, und wir treffen uns am Ende der Brücke wieder und finden endlich in das richtige Treppenhaus. Nach dem Erwachen weiss ich nur noch aus der Art der Erinnerung, dass ich von Gisela geträumt haben muss. Gedanke dabei: Es ist wie auf der Jagd nach einem sehr edlen und seltenen Wild, das nur wenige Augenblicke in der Dämmerung aus dem Dickicht hervortritt und erst, nachdem es verschwunden ist, wird man sich dessen bewusst, dass man ihm gegenüber gestanden hat. Dann erst werden mir die einzelnen Züge des Traums allmählich deutlicher. (328 words)

Ich überlegte einen Augenblick lang, ob ich ihm helfen sollte, sah aber, dass es keinen Zweck hatte, weil keine Dachpappe da war ausser der alten durchlöcherten. Auf dem Flur hatten die Handwerker ungeschickt mit einer Kette das grosse Bild des Grossvaters heruntergerissen und in Stücke zerbrochen. Im Jungens-Zimmer (es hatte den Charakter unserer hiesigen Stube) wurden Doppelbetten aufgestellt. T.W. (TessenWerner) sagte, es sei nötig, wir müssten doch jetzt zu dritt hier schlafen (Emmi hinter dem Schirm). Ich: Aber da sind doch nicht so viele und zweistöckige Betten nötig.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0185 (1950-02-25 - Göttingen)Die Vögel singen. Es ist morgen. Ich war im Traum in russische Gefangenschaft geraten. Plötzlich auf dem Marsch wurde ich von einem älteren deutschen Offizier in Obhut genommen, zusammen mit einem anderen Kamaraden. Wir wurden in einer kleinen Zelle untergebracht, die breite Fenster zur Einfahrt eines grossen Schlosses öffnete. Dort sassen wir immer und schauten hinaus, hatten alle Freiheiten und waren gut gekleidet, doch wussten wir nicht, wer in dem Schloss wohnte oder hatten es vergessen. Eines abends sah ich ein wenig entfernt die Russen tanzen. Es waren junge Offiziere, die dort Tänze lernten. Ich sagte zu meinem deutschen Hüter, der gerade vorbeikam: "Dort würde ich gerne mittanzen. Solche Tänze würde ich gerne lernen". Er sagte: "Heute Abend hast Du Ausgang und kannst dort im grossen Haufen mittanzen". Ich schaute auf den Schlosshof und in dem Moment sah ich von der königlichen weiss-roten Fassade des Bauwerks eine Gruppe Menschen herankommen, in deren Mitte mir ein hoher deutscher Offizier auffiel. Zuerst entdeckte ich eine Spange mit den Schwingen eines Adlers an seiner Uniform, die ihn als hohen Offizier der Luftwaffe auszeichnete. Ich machte meinen Kumpanen darauf aufmerksam und unser Unteroffizier sagte: "Da kommt der Badener". Es war der Grossherzog von Baden, der hier gefangen lag. Als er das Tor durchschritt und alle ihm huldigten und grüssten, sah ich genau sein würdiges, vom Alter gezeichnetes Gesicht, das diese Huldigungen etwas verwundert und befremdet entgegennahm. Sein Rock war mit vielen Orden geschmückt, unter denen ich das Eiserne Kreuz und den Pour le mérite klar erkannte. Ich dachte: Es steht einem Fürsten auch in Gefangenschaft nicht an, seine Orden abzulegen. Er ist wahrhaft Fürst geblieben. Ich träumte im Erwachen noch viel von Russland, sah mich mit Gisela dort zusammentreffen, die ebenfalls gefangen war. Wir lebten in einem Russenhäuschen und hatten ein Kind. Dann machten wir grosse Reisen bis zu Stalin, und baten von ihm die Freiheit, heimzukehren, wann wir wollten. Wir waren in russischen Grosstädten und arbeiteten an russischen Filmen. Doch waren dies alles keine Bilder mehr, sondern nur noch Gedanken. (337 words)

Doch als wir Gisela begegneten, musste ich sie absetzen und stehenlassen. - Dieter kam zu Besuch und hatte gleich das Bedürfnis, in der Stube Ordnung zu schaffen. Verabredungen mit Gisela spielten in den Traum hinein. So mussten wir an ein Ufer gehen, um sie im Boot abzuholen. Doch waren die Verhältnisse sehr verwickelt und unübersichtlich. Ich erinnere nur noch, dass sie eine Strecke, die mit dem Boot zu durchqueren war, sehr kurz abschätzte und sich wunderte, als ich meinte, dass man, über sie zu rudern, länger brauchte. - (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0187 (1950-02-27 - Göttingen)In einer fremden Stadt auf der Suche nach dem Bahnhof. Ich gehe meinem Gefühl nach auf das Stadtzentrum zu, indem ich dem Gefälle der Strassen folge (Kiel). Merkwürdige Strassennamen, die mir von einem Passanten etymologisch erklärt werden. Sie ändern sich zuweilen, indem sie aus dem selben Stamm andere Bildungen hervortreiben oder mit anderen Namen kombiniert werden. - Dann begegnet mir eine lange Kolonne von Zünften, die in einem Vorbeimarsch Zeichen und Symbole ihrer Arbeit tragen, auch kurze Darstellungen des Arbeitsganges der Zunft. Ich habe die Aufgabe, mich an die Spitze des Zuges zu setzen, der jetzt in meiner Richtung geht. Es geht aus der Stadt hinaus. An der Spitze sind zwei weissbraune Pferde, die der Führung bedürfen, weil sie schon einmal ausgebrochen sind. Ich habe einen älteren, erfahrenen Begleiter, der von einem Wagen das eine Pferd kutschiert. Das andere habe ich Mühe zu halten. Schliesslich sind wir an einem grossen Gatter angelangt, über das die Pferde in ein Gehege zu bringen sind. Der ältere Mann - es ist ein Unteroffizier - setzt sich auf das eine Pferd und ein zweiter Begleiter auf das andere. Während der erste sofort mühelos über das Gatter kommt, bäumt sich das Pferd des anderen auf und sucht im Sprung die höchste Stelle des Gatters, dessen oberste Stange es mit dem Bauche streift, so dass es sekundenlang darauf schwebt. Dann bricht alles zusammen und Pferd und Reiter überschlagen sich. Ich sehe diesen Vorgang in Zeitloupe und während ich erkenne, wie der Reiter in einem gewaltigen Salto rückwärts sich dem schweren Fall des Pferdes entzieht, durchfährt mich der Gedanke, wie es möglich sei, diese Aufnahme in diesem dramatischen Moment in Zeitloupe zu bringen. Es begleitet mich dabei die Vorstellung einer Kamera, die oben auf dem Gatter angebracht ist und den Vorgang filmt, gleichzeitig damit, dass ich ihn sehe. - Es wäre - das bedrückt mich tief - meine Aufgabe gewesen, die oberste Stange des Gatters zu entfernen. Doch hatte ich es nicht für nötig gehalten, da das erste Pferd so glatt passiert war. Das gestürzte Pferd ist sogleich tot und nach einer Weile erkenne ich an einem grossen weissen Blatt, auf dem der Name des Reiters mit einem Kreuz eingetragen ist, dass auch er tot ist. Mit dem Bewusstsein einer entsetzlich drückenden Schuld erwache ich. In einem erneuten Einschlafen setzt sich das Motiv der Pferde fort in einem Traum mit Gisela, der umso beglückender ist. Sie hat eine Krankheit, die ihr die Beine lähmt, doch der Arzt, der die Gestalt Lehmanns (des Dirigenten Fritz Lehmann) hat, stellt fest, dass nur eine seelische Hemmung vorliegt. Er fährt ihr mit der Hand zwischen die Beine und elektrisiert sie dadurch so, dass sie völlig gelöst wird und in grosse Heiterkeit ausbricht. Mit diesem Gefühl der Heiterkeit und einer grossen Sicherheit wache ich auf. Man sollte diese Sicherheit des Traumes nicht verachten, auch wenn sie unseren Wünschen folgt. Sie ist eine Quelle grosser Kraft und reicht bis in metaphysische Tiefen hinab, dorthin, wo wir wirklich einen Zugang zu dem Sein des anderen haben. (502 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0191 (1950-03-08 - Wittmoldt)Politischer Traum. Sehr kühl und rational. Gespräch ohne sichtbare Personen. Zwischengestalten aus dem Mittelalter. Typen etwa wie Wilhelm II und Bismarck. Es geht um eine Kriegführung, zu der ein Länderbund dem Kaiser verpflichtet ist. Einige Länder fehlen in diesem Bund. Der Grund zu diesem Fehlen wird von einer Frauenstimme erzählt. Es ist die Stimme einer Frau, die zu diesem Bund gehört, der noch jetzt wie manches alte eine schattenhafte gesellschaftliche Existenz führt. Mehr theaterhaft. Die Geschichte geht auf finanzielle Streitigkeiten zwischen dem Kaiser und dem Wittelsbacher zurück. Dieser erhält ein freies Haus für Künstler. Man sieht eine sehr schöne, mit viel Glas errichtete Villa. Der Kaiser will Geld von ihm und, als der Bayer sagt, dass er jetzt keines hat, hört man den Kaiser sagen: es muss doch jeder (sc. von den Künstlern) etwas dazu geben können. Der Bayer antwortet erbost: "Macht euren Dreck allene". Er meinte nur: Ich will mit der Geldsache nichts zu tun haben. Der Kaiser legt es als Austritt aus dem Bund aus und entlässt ihn. - Das Fehlen anderer Länder ist in folgender Szene begründet. Einige aufsässige Städte werden von deren umliegenden Ländern belagert. Als nun das Heer des Kaisers kommt, um die Aufsässigen niederzuschlagen, findet es den Zugang zu den Städten von den belagernden Heeren versperrt. Der Kaiser fasst das irrtümlich als Gegnerschaft auf und das kaiserliche Heer legt nun einen zweiten Belagerungsring um die Belagerer. (232 words)

Doch behinderte mich eine sehr lange Stange, die ich in der Hand trug, bei der Annäherung an die verschlossene Tür, deren Schloss ich erst öffnen musste. Ich kam in Gefahr, durch das Hantieren mit der Stange Autos und Strassenbahnen durcheinander zu bringen und selbst übergefahren zu werden. So sprang ich schliesslich immer schneller zwischen diesen Fahrzeugen hin und her, ohne dass mir die Annäherung and diese Tür gelang.

Zuletzt die Bilder über den Schweriner Dom. Ich trat, um sie mit der Wirklichkeit zu vergleichen, in das Portal des Domes ein. Drinnen Orgelmusik, eine Sängerin und einige Zuhörer. Die Probe zu einem abendlichen Konzert. Auch einen Sänger entdeckte ich später und N.G. (Professor Niedeggen-Gebhardt) als Regisseur. Ich setzte mich auf eine Bank. Die wackelte. Darum stand ich mit einer Entschuldigung, die ich zu meinem Nebenmann, Professor Wolf, sprach, auf, mit dem ich Rücken an Rücken sass. Später auf einem Stuhl neben Frau Strehlocke, die mir gut zuredete.

Ich erwachte mit dem Gefühl grenzenloser Einsamkeit. Doch dachte ich daran, dass der Heiland mit unter den Ertrinkenden war. Dann fiel mein Blick auf das Bild von Gisela und es fiel mir ein, dass ich nie mehr allein bin.

Dazu hielt der Standesbeamte eine feierliche Rede, in der es hiess, dass die Dinge lange in schwierigen Debatten in der Schwebe bleiben könnten, bis ein Zeuge Gottes käme und die ganze Sache wie von selbst in die Reihe käme. Mir war die ganze Angelegenheit widrig, und ich kniff die Augen. Dann war ich erwacht und sass in Schwerin im Esszimmer, um den Traum aufzuschreiben. Mix sass mir gegenüber und erzählte laut Geschichten. So kam ich nicht zum Aufschreiben und hörte sie geduldig an. Doch als es mir zu bunt wurde, verbot ich ihr einfach den Mund, weil ich den Traum sonst vergessen hätte. Da gab es einen Tumult, in den sich Vater und Emmi einmischten. Ich konnte nun den Traum erst recht nicht mehr behalten und wurde noch lauter. In der Debatte hiess es, wenn ich an den Nervenarzt Dr. Köhler geschrieben hätte, dann müsse ich ja auch krank sein, und was denn eigentlich los sei. Man wollte mir mein Traumbuch entreissen, und ich wehrte mich. Ich konnte mich gar nicht mehr besinnen, geschrieben zu haben. Doch schliesslich sah ich einen Antwortbrief aus Paris an meinen Bruder und mich, des Inhalts, dass die Schreiber jetzt keine Zeit hätten, auf unsere Gedanken einzugehen. Dazu ein Couvert mit der Adresse: Dr. sowieso, Paris, chez Driesch. Ich erkannte daraus, dass er bei Driesch wohnte, und beneidete ihn um den schönen Aufenthalt in Paris. Dann wachte ich endgültig auf und ärgerte mich über den vergessenen Traum, bis mir seine Teile wieder einfielen. (279 words)

Ein Restaurant hatte den ganzen Dachgarten mit Mohnkuchenstücken gepflastert. Nun regnete es, und ich war sehr um das Schicksal des Kuchens besorgt. - Andere Träume gingen um einen Film, der völlig in seiner Handlung ausgesponnen war und den ich später sogar jemand erzählte. Ich weiss noch, dass, ich in dieser Erzählung vieles fortliess, um die Spannung nicht zu vermindern. Jetzt tut es mir leid, dass ich das tat. Ich hätte sonst den Gang der Handlung wohl besser behalten. Es waren Anklänge an den "Dritten Mann" und das Thema von "Arzt und Dämon". Ein Mann hatte die Möglichkeit, durch eine Zauberformel sich zu verwandeln in was er wollte. Er musste dazu auf einen dicken Strich steigen, und auf diesem stehend war er dann die gewünschte Person.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0208 (1950-04-07 - Wittmoldt)Am Morgen nach dem Erwachen. Ich bekam eben im Traum einen Brief von Ernst Jünger. Auf dem Absender standen die Worte: Ernst Jünger / In den Bergen Österreichs / Auf der Reise nach den Schneebergen Asiens. - Ich öffnete vorsichtig den Umschlag und begann, die netzartig über das Papier ausgeworfene Schrift zu entziffern. Da wurde mir klar, dass alles nur Traum sei, aber ich behielt die Augen geschlossen und las weiter. Dabei nahm ich mir vor, nichts dort zu suchen, was mir schmeicheln könnte. Nach einigen freundlichen Sätzen fand ich eine tiefgründige Kritik: "Sie haben viel getan, um ihre Tage zu runden, aber Tage runden sich ganz von selber." Auch wurde mir gesagt, dass ich meine Gedanken nicht nur in Briefen aufschreiben dürfe, sondern auch Tagebuchaufzeichnungen für mich ganz allein machen müsse. Das ist um so merkwürdiger, als ich erst vor kurzer Zeit in einem Brief den Gedanken aufschrieb, dass der Dialog dem Monologe überlegen sei. - Schliesslich zweifelte ich doch daran, dass der Brief, den ich vor mit hatte, nur ein Traumbild sei. Ich riss die Augen auf und tippte auf das Papier - aber ich hatte nur auf die Bettdecke getippt, und nun war alles verloren. Aber ich wurde mir dabei klar, welch reiche Fischzüge wir im Reich des Traumes machen können. und wie objektiv die Dinge sind, die wir dort finden. - So sah ich ganz deutlich den Brief vor mir, und obwohl ich wusste, dass es nur Traum war, war ich doch von einer solchen Neugier gepackt, dass ich wie ein Schlafwandler weiter las. Ich weiss noch, dass ich beim Öffnen des Couverts mich bemühte, es nicht zu zerreissen. (273 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0216 (1950-04-24 - Wittmoldt)Träume über ein Hotelzimmer, in dem nacheinander Emmi, Ika, Gisela und ich gewohnt hatten. Teilweise war es in Göttingen. Ich stand mit Gisela vor dem Gebäude, in dessen 11. Stockwerk sich das Zimmer befand. Die drei obersten Stockwerke waren einsturzgefährdet, weil der Dachstuhl, aus dem sie als Giebel hervorragten, zu weich war. Gisela erzählte, dass sie schon damals Befürchtungen gehabt hätte, als sie in dem Zimmer gelegen hatte. (Erinnerungen an die Zimmerklinik) Teilweise war es auch in Hannover - es handelte sich um das Wiederfinden des Gebäudes und die Orientierung in den Strassen (Louisenhof) - und später in München. Hier kam ich mit Emmi zusammen dorthin. Ich wollte noch einige vergessene Sachen in dem Zimmer zusammen suchen, doch Emmi strebte heraus, weil sie zu sehr an die Zeit erinnert wurde, in der sie ganz dort gewohnt hatte (Jugendberghaus in Bayrischzell). - Mit Ika handelte es sich um eine Korrespondenz auf einer Postkarte mit einem Bild des Hauses, auf der sie das Fenster ihres Zimmers mit einem Kreuz bezeichnet hatte. Bei der Überlegung, wie ich antworten sollte, wachte ich auf. Doch waren alle diese Phasen des Traums nicht streng getrennt, sondern ineinander geschoben, miteinander verwoben.- (194 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0219 (1950-05-09 - Göttingen)Wieder im Hause künftiger Wohnherren, bei denen auch Alli und Emmi wohnen sollen. Sie wohnen in einem entzückenden und königlich gepflegten Barocklandhaus. Die Kunst des Blumeneinstellens ist dort entwickelt wie in China, und mit grossem Genuss helfe ich, die Blumenstile in den Vasen zurechtrücken, auf deren Glasur noch feuchte Tröpfchen hängen. Es ist eine ideale Welt. - Vorher teilweise Wohnung auf einem Dachboden, den man nur auf dem Bauche oder Rücken kriechend erreichen kann. Ich habe dabei Angst, meine grauen Anzug, den ich so liebe, zu strapazieren. Dort oben ist es erdrückend schwül und dumpfig. Ich öffne eine Dachluke. Frische Luft. Unten wohnt Vater. Er hat ein Radio, das erst umgepolt werden muss, um richtigen Empfang zu geben. Wir haben Gleichstrom. Im Keller wirkt Emmi mit einer Hilfskraft. Grosse Wäsche. Später - das war vor dem Einzug in das gepflegte Landhaus - mit Alli zusammen wartend auf dem Hof. Wir haben gleichzeitig ein Pferd, einen Hund (wie Pfiffi) und ein Baby (im Wagen) zu hüten, die schwer zu bändigen sind. Dass das Pferd nicht in den Kinderwagen schlägt, der Hund nicht zu dem Baby kommt. Doch gelingt mit Mühe die Direktion aller dieser unbändigen Kräfte, an der ich eine gewisse Freude empfinde. Dann ist der Eintritt in das weite Haus und das Gespräch mit der wohlgesinnten Frau wie eine grosse Erquickung und Belohnung. Ich fühle mich wie der Fisch ins Wasser geworfen. Auch hierbei habe ich den Hund an der Leine, die er bis zum äussersten straff zieht. Ich helfe der Frau, die Tischchen zwischen den Blumenvasen umzusetzen, und sie sagt dabei: "nur langsam". Ich fühle mich in einer königlichen Atmosphäre, in der man das Gewicht der Dinge, die man hebt, erkennt. Ein unbeschreibliches Glücksgefühl erfüllt mich - noch jetzt in der Erinnerung, in der die Dinge unverrückbar mit der Gestalt Giselas verbunden sind. - Übrigens, die Kräfte des Kindes beruhen in der Schwerkraft des Wagens, der oft kaum vom Pferde fern zu halten ist.

Mich fasste ein Schauder bei der Vorstellung, dass nun alles, worin ich lange Zeit gelebt hatte, vernichtet sei. Auf der Treppe begegnete mir gleich, völlig verzweifelt, mein Bruder, und ich tröstete ihn sehr. Die vordere Zimmerfront des Hauses war ausgebrannt. Die Möbel unseres Zimmers waren alle gerettet und standen bereits wieder in anderer Zusammenordnung in einem kleineren Raum des Hauses. Auch Stresaus hatten fast alles gerettet. Dagegen waren die Möbel in den Zimmern des Arztes über uns vernichtet. Die Feuerwehr rollte bereits die Schläuche zusammen, und mich beschäftigte der Gedanke, dass in dieser Situation es einmal wirklich berechtigt sei, was man als Kind so oft gemacht habe: Abends aus dem Fenster schauen, ob das Haus nicht brenne.

Das Ganze hing wohl zusammen mit einem fremdsprachigen Text, den wir vorher in einem Seminar lasen, wobei wir ziemlich schnell den Stoff bewältigten, der nur 3 Kapitel umfasste. Doch spielten hier auch Märcheninhalte hinein. Es war eine andere Fassung des Filminhaltes (Schneewittchen), den ich gestern sah. - Andere Traumelemente: ein Tanzfest, der Sportlerball, den ich mit Margund mitmachte, hier aber in kirchlicher Umgebung - und der Wunsch, etwas auszuleihen (das Grammophon, das ich gestern für Rudolf von einem Theologiestudenten entleihen sollte) hier aber eine Harke oder anderes Gartengerät. Hier spielte wieder die Frau eines Studentenpfarrers hinein. Im Grunde wohl die Gestalt der Frau vom Sportinstitut, die mich durch die Gartennachbarschaft zu Giselas Garten kannte. Doch trug die Frau die Züge eines Mädchens, die ich gestern in dem Film (Kino) sah und vom Volkstanz her kenne, die einen ganz bestimmten Typ verkörpert, wie ihn Pfarrersfrauen oft haben. Freundlich, unternehmungslustig, stolz, mit Elan, aber etwas auf bestimmte Geleise eingefahren, so dass man nicht immer mit ihnen zusammen bleiben möchte. (195 words)

Dann ein neues Abwehrmittel gegen die Krankheit, das uns in Form einer süssen, schokoladen- oder chremeartigen Speise von einem Arzt gereicht wurde. Im Erwachen Gedanke an Helga E. In den Traum spielte die Szene eines Tanzfestes hinein in einem Hause, in dem diese Krankheit herrschte. Ich wurde untersucht und zeigte bereits latente Symptome, so ein Erlaschen der Körperspannung. Ich fiel in mich zusammen und wurde dem Bilde des Hirsches ähnlich, dem der Kopf hintenüber hing. Auch erwartete ich die geistigen Folgen der Krankheit. - Als ich aber von der Speise gegessen hatte, fühlte ich mich frisch gestärkt, und nach dem Erwachen fiel mir die heitere Melodie einer Arie aus einer Bachschen Pfingstkantate ein, die ich gestern in der Kirche hörte und die mich sehr berührte, weil ich sie in den letzten Wochen oft von J.H.F. hörte, wenn ich bei Gisela zu Besuch war (174 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0246 (1950-05-31 - Göttingen)Träumte heute Nacht von Jürgen Wächter, dass er nicht gefallen, sondern aus der Gefangenschaft heimgekehrt sei. Die Nachricht von seinem Tode stellte sich als Verwechslung heraus, deren Einzelheiten er mir genau erzählte. Auch bezog sich unser Gespräch hauptsächlich auf militärische Dinge, auf die Truppenansammlungen zur Zeit des Kriegsendes in der Stadt Göttingen. Diese Truppen befanden sich hauptsächlich in dem Gelände nordöstlich der Stadt, in dem ich im vorigen Sommer meine grossen Spaziergänge machte und das ich seitdem nur selten betreten habe. - Die Initiation zu dem Traum mit Jürgen Wächter war folgendermassen: Ich nahm mit Gisela an einem Seminar des Psychotherapeuten Kühnel teil, obwohl sie eigentlich nicht dafür angemeldet war. Als er in der Beziehung einmal eine allgemeine Frage stellte, wollte ich sie zurückhalten, sich noch nachträglich zu melden, weil es im Gedränge gar nicht aufgefallen wäre. Sie aber tauschte wie selbstverständlich einige Blicke mit ihm und erhielt seine Bestätigung. Nach Beendigung des Seminars hatte ich noch zwei Stunden Zeit bis zu Beginn des Kurses in der Rasemühle und hatte nun die Wahl, diese Stunden mit Gisela zu verbringen, oder Christian aus dem Webetanz zu diktieren. Wir standen noch unschlüssig vor seinem Haus, als Christian erschien und mir Jürgens Ankunft verkündigte. Dann wechselte die Szene und ich war mit diesem zusammen. Nach dem militärischen Gespräch erwähnte ich etwas aus unserer Vergangenheit - ich glaube, es bezog sich auf seine Veranlagung für psychologische Dinge. - Da sagte er: "Es ist schön, wenn Du mich an diese Zeit erinnerst. Sie ist meiner Erinnerung ganz entfallen." (253 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0249 (1950-06-04 - Göttingen)Ich spielte im Traum die Rolle eines hohen Offiziers, in der ich eine Parade abnehmen musste, wobei immer neue Menschen an mir vorbeizogen. (In dieser Art stehe ich manchmal am Fenster und beobachte die Strassenpassanten.) Die Szene bildete einen Ausschnitt aus einem langen Film, in den immer wieder das Erwachen wie das Aufleuchten des Lichts im Zuschauerraum einspielte. Eine Zeit lang war ich ganz wach und erwartete das Einschlafen, um den Film weiterzusehen. Es war ein langer französischer Film voller mimischer Feinheiten (Etwa in der Form der "Kinder des Olymp", die ich aus Giselas Schilderung her kenne). Einmal in einer Szene, in der das Wort dominierte, hatte ich die Augen geschlossen. Ich wurde geweckt durch das Klatschen der Zuschauer und sah, als ich die Augen öffnete, eine bezaubernde Szene: Kinder auf einem kleinen Karussell, das sich in feiner Rhythmik wiegte. Ich war erstaunt über die Bannkraft dieses Spiels, die so gross war, dass sie das Bewusstsein der blossen Technik des Vorgangs durchbrach. Im Kino klatscht man sonst ja nicht, weil niemand gegenwärtig ist, der den Beifall entgegennehmen könnte. - Bei einer Szene im Gespräch mit Emmi, die neben mir sass, über Geisteskrankheit. Ich erklärte ihr, dass solche Krankheit oftmals körperlich bedingt sei. (Lektüre gestern abend. - Muddings Arteriosklerose.) Mudding sass in einem Stuhl vor uns und genoss den Film. (Fortsetzung des Traumtextes aus dem Kontext:) So entwickelte sich die Traumszene auch aus einer anderen Handlung, in der ich das Gelände des Filmateliers durchschritt und den Gesprächen einiger Fachleute über die Möglichkeiten lauschte, die diese Landschaft böte. Es war eine Landschaft, ähnlich der des kleinen Friedhofs am Wall, auf dem ein Teil des Films "die Nachtwache" gedreht wurde und die eine grosse Rolle spielt in dem System, das die Strassen und Wege dieser Stadt in meinem Unterbewusstsein bilden. In einer anderen Szene des Traums sagte mir Margund, dass sie sich ganz von mir lösen wolle. (314 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0250 (1950-06-05 - Göttingen)In einer grossen Töpferei auf dem Lande. Ich trug ein mächtiges Tongefäss ohne Boden, den Teil eines grösseren Gebildes, in ein scheunenartiges Gebäude. Vor dem Eingang begegnete mir die Meisterin mit den Käufern dieses Gefässes, die sich beschwerten, dass sie den Eingang in das Gebäude nicht gefunden hätten. Drinnen seien lauter so stachelige Kakteen. Sie forderte sogleich von ihnen für das grosse Teilstück, das ich trug, Bezahlung. Sie könne dafür allein das Risiko nicht mehr tragen. Ich wusste nun, das ich sehr vorsichtig damit umgehen musste. Ich rief mir zwei in der Nähe Arbeitende herbei, um es noch einmal vorsichtig abzusetzen und dann erneut aufzunehmen und in die Scheune zu tragen. Drinnen war es plötzlich ein Gerippe, das ich zu transportieren hatte. Ich legte es mit einer anderen Hilfe sehr sorgfältig Stück für Stück hinter der Tür an der Wand in der gepflasterten Diele nieder. Es bestand aus drei Teilen: Kopf, Schultern und dem oberen Teil der Wirbelsäule. Das stellte ich etwas hochgekantet in die Ecke hinter der Tür. Dann das Mittelstück mit den Rippen, was ungefähr die Form der zylinderförmigen Gefässwand hatte, die ich im Anfang tragen musste, - überhaupt waren alle Teile des Gerippes sehr stilisiert - und als dritten Teil die Beckenknochen mit den Hüften und den Beinen. (Ich lag gestern lange in der Obstplantage und betrachtete die Menschen, die sich dort sonnten. Die Einteilung des Gerippes ist stark beeinflusst einerseits von der sexuellen Betonung des Körpers - Hüften, Beine, Becken - andererseits von der Art, wie die zweiteiligen Badeanzüge einen Frauenkörper aufteilen). - Ich war sehr besorgt, die Teile möglichst natürlich hinzulegen, damit die Angehörigen von dem Anblick nicht betroffen seien. Dann ging mein Gehilfe weg, und ich stand nun allein bei dem Gerippe, das hinter der Tür im Schatten lag, während die Sonne auf das Steinpflaster schien. Doch da entdeckte ich hinter dem anderen Türflügel im Schatten einen grossen dunklen Schmetterling, der die Rolle eines Aasgeiers spielte. Ich mochte darum das Gerippe nicht allein lassen und rief den jungen Herrn v. B. herein, den ich im Hintergrund der Scheune sah - die Szene spielte jetzt in Wittmoldt. - Wir packten das Gerippe in einen Sarg, ohne die Teile noch einmal anfassen zu müssen, denn es lag jetzt in Holzwolle, wie man sie in Särgen hat, war auch mit solcher bedeckt und das Ganze in ein grosses Papier gehüllt (weihnachtspapierartig), an dem wir es nur zu ergreifen brauchten, um das Ganze Bündel in den schwarzen Sarg zu versenken. Ich hatte Sorgen, dass es nicht hineinpassen würde, doch es passte haargenau. (Hier spielen Erinnerungen von der Einsargung meines Vaters eine grosse Rolle, die ja in Wittmoldt vor sich ging). Ich wollte noch einmal hineinsehen, ob die drei Teile des Gerippes auch richtig lägen, doch sagte man mir, dies sei nicht nötig, die Angehörigen würden doch nicht mehr hineinsehen und sie lägen auch richtig. - Übrigens trug mein Gehilfe beim ersten Niederlegen der Teile die Züge eines Psychologen, den ich gestern beim Sonnen in der Obstplantage traf und der mir beiläufig drei Träume über Plessner analysierte, die ich ihm erzählte) (512 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0257 (1950-06-10 - Göttingen)Besuch bei Rudolf (Jaentzsch) vor seiner Abreise. Ich half ihm noch die Schubladen durchsehen, ob er auch nichts vergessen hatte. - Auf dem Balkan: Betrachtung der Meereswogen am Strand. Doch hörte ich nichts. - Einen dritten Teil des Traums hatte ich heute Nacht schon Wort für Wort zur Niederschrift überlegt und war am Morgen auch des Glaubens, ihn aufgeschrieben zu haben. Jetzt habe ich ausser einem diffusen Sitationsgefühl, dass es sich um ein Mitschreiben verbunden mit Radiohören handelte und andere Personen dabei eine Rolle spielten, fast alles vergessen: Ich erinnere mich noch dunkel, das ich eigentlich nichts zu schreiben wusste, wohl weil ich nur hören wollte. Auch stand der Traum mit dem Bild von der Meeresbrandung in Zusammenhang, und ich weiss, dass in dem ganzen Traumgebilde und seiner geplanten Suchschrift das Gleichgewicht, das Bild einer Waage, eine Rolle spielte. Heute Morgen erwachte ich mit dem Gefühl, mein seelisches Gleichgewicht verloren zu haben. In dieser Niederschrift scheint es mir wiederhergestellt.-- (Später im Tagebuch dieses Tags:) Plötzlich fällt mir der Traum ein, den ich heute Nacht vergessen habe. Ich ging zu Ru . ach das hab ich ja schon aufgeschrieben - also doch nicht der vergessene Teil.- Die richtige Verbindung von philosophischer und naturwissenschaftlicher Psychologie scheint mir ein Schlüssel zur richtigen Vermittlung idealistischer und realistischer Weltansichten zu bilden. (Einfall bei der Lektüre von "Sein und Zeit". - Der Gedanke kündigte sich übrigens durch einen Pfiff an, der meinen Bruder zu den verwunderten Worten veranlasste "Was ist denn mit Dir los?" ( Erste Erwähnung von "Sein und Zeit". Vorhergegangen ein längeres Tagebuchstück über Kretschmers "Medizinische Psychologie") - ( In dem dem diesem Traum 257 vorhergehenden Tagebuch ist von Gisela und Franz die Rede. - Rudolf, ich und Franz waren nacheinander ihre Freude. Rudolf wart in Bulgarien geboren ). (295 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0258 (1950-06-11 - Göttingen)Die Gespräche des Traums und des Halbbewussten registriere ich mehr in klanglicher Art. Ich kann dann meine Erinnerung belauschen und die Worte und Sätze aufschreiben, oft ohne ihren Sinn zu verstehen. Erst später an Hand der Nachschrift oder wach bewusster Erinnerung wird mir dann oft der Sinn deutlich. So entstehen wohl manche Gedanken und Conceptionen durch ein halb probierendes Vorsichhinsprechen. Sie kommen ins Bewusstsein wie das Ende eines abgerissene Films. Wenn irgend ein äusseres Geräusch mich stört, ist dann manchmal die akustische Erinnerung verloren - Heute Nacht träumte ich etwas von Bille und es ging um die Frage, ob sie basedowoid veranlagt sei. (Hier ist wohl etwas von Gisela auf Bille übertragen) - Das Hören von Stimmen ist für meine Träume recht charakteristisch - meist verbunden mit dem motorischen Erlebnis des eigene Sprechens - so wie man manchmal im Erwachen sich selber - aber von innen heraus - schnarchen hört. Das gibt dann ein dröhnendes, rasselndes Geräusch und Empfinden, das wie durch einen Schlund zu strudeln scheint. So ähnlich sind auch hier Gehör und Sprachempfinden im Traumgespräch gekoppelt. Zuweilen allerdings - und zwar im tieferen Traum - sind die Sätze auch eindeutig fremden Personen zugeordnet und es gibt richtige Gespräche. (200 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0259 (1950-06-13 - Göttingen)Träumte heute Nacht von Frl. Av. und Gisela, mit denen ich einen Koffer eine steile Bodentreppe hinauftragen musste. Ich war eifersüchtig, denn die beiden waren verheiratet. Nur war mir die Situation nicht ganz klar. Der Dachboden war sehr eng und spitzwinklig. Wenn man die Fensterluken öffnete, wurden die Wäscheleinen mit hochgerissen, die an deren Griffen befestigt waren. Zuletzt sank ich vor Giselas Füssen in mich zusammen und diese tröstete mich sehr.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0260 (1950-06-13 - Göttingen)Ein anderer Traum: Ich sah einen Ausschnitt aus einem sehr raffinierten Film. Eine Uhr in schematischer Gestalt eines Vogels, der die Zeit verschlingt (Trickaufnahme - ähnlich wie im Scheewittchenfilm) und erst gesättigt ist, als er Krieg ausgestossen hat. Dann wechselt das Bild. Man sieht von oben auf einen grossen Platz voller Menschen und Getriebe. Dann wird dieser Platz einmal herumgeschwenkt wie der Boden einer Luftschaukel, die sich überschlägt, dass alle Menschen auf dem Kopf stehen, oder als machte der Kameramann einen Louping. - Ich sitze sehr versunken in meinem Zuschauerstuhl und merke kaum, wie ich von der Platzanweiserin angestossen werde, weil ich mit meiner Karte auf einem zu teuren Platz sitze. Erwachen. (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0261 (1950-06-14 - Göttingen)Um ein Haar fiel ich in ein Wasserloch beim Vollschöpfen der Giesskanne. Dann drohte mir der Eimer im Morast zu versinken. Zuletzt konnte ich die gefüllten Gefässe nicht über die glitschige Böschung hochkriegen. Dann wachte ich auf und war sichtlich erleichtert, dass ich mich darum nun nicht mehr zu kümmern brauchte. In einem der Nachbargärten sah ich beim Hinweg einen Mann ganz unbekleidet bei der Arbeit auf der Erde knien. Als Grund dafür gab er an, er habe einen Sonnenbrand und könne darum keine Kleidung auf der Haut vertragen. (89 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0262 (1950-06-15 - Göttingen)Sah heute Nacht im Traum einen wunderbaren Film. Ein sehr gepflegtes Institutsgebäude - gleichzeitig Erholungsheim - mit vielen gekachelten Badeanlagen wird von einer Truppe belegt. Der Mann, der die Belegung anordnet, trägt eine grosse metallene Kette um den Hals, die gleichzeitig wie die Kette einer militärischen Frontpolizei und wie die Kette eines Kanzlers aussieht. Der Mann ist auch der Vorgesetzte der Truppe. Er verhandelt mit einer Frau, der die Obhut über das Haus anvertraut ist. Während dieser Verhandlung, die an einem Tisch vor sich geht, an dem auch die ganze Truppe wie zu einer Mahlzeit versammelt ist, zeigt der Mann sehr geistige Züge. Fast die Physiognomie eines Schauspielers. Er hofft, der Frau das Heim nach Ende des Krieges - so deutet er an - unversehrt wieder übergeben zu können, oder eventuell beschädigte Einrichtungen dann wiederherzustellen - wenn es dann überhaupt noch eine Technik gäbe, mit der das möglich sei - so deutet er an -, was allerdings fraglich und auch nicht wünschenswert wäre. Man spürt, dass er sich eine orientalische Kultur wünscht, in der die Zweckkategorie eine untergeordnete Rolle spielt. Später weist der Mann seine Truppe an, in die Räume einzuziehen: "Aber seht Euch vor, dass Ihr nichts kaputt macht". Dann geht er die Treppe zum Ausgang hinab, und ich spiele nun diese Rolle. Vor der Tür hält mich ein Mann an, der eine Uniform trägt, die an Polizei und Luftschutz erinnert: "Wo willst Du hin?" - "Nach draussen" - "Aber doch nicht im Schlafanzug!" - Ich schaue meine Uniform an. Sie trägt keinerlei Abzeichen und zeigt bewusst vereinfachte Formen. Ich drehe mich um und zeige auf Andere, die auch die Treppe runter kommen: "Kuck mal, die gehen alle im Schlafanzug". Nun gehe ich unangefochten aus der Tür. Draussen sehe ich auf einer Wiese einen Jungen, der ein wildes Pferd am Zaum führt. Es bricht immer wieder aus, und schliesslich sieht man beide stürzen. Ich fürchte, dass der Junge vom Pferd verletzt ist, doch beide erheben sich langsam. Doch nun sind es zwei Pferde, die sich jagen, ein Rappe und ein gescheckter Schimmel. Sie kommen gefährlich nah auf mich zu. Doch nun ist schon die ganze Weide voller Pferde. Menschen sieht man dazwischen gehen, andere spielen Fussball, alles tummelt sich durcheinander. Ich muss zuweilen ausweichen, um nicht umgerannt zu werden. Dann entdecke ich zwischen den Menschen auch sehr primitive und derbe Gesichter aus vorgeschichtlicher Zeit. Es leuchtet mir ein, dass wir uns in einer Zeit befinden, in der hochgradig verfeinerte Rassen mit solchen primitiven Frühtypen durcheinander leben (Ferner Anklang an Heliopolis). Einer von ihnen zielt mit einem Revolver - so zum Spass - auf einen anderen. Ich untersage es ihm. Darauf richtet er den Revolver grinsend auf mich. Es fällt mir ein, dass ich ihm scharf in die Augen sehen muss, um Macht über ihn zu haben. Während ich es tue und dabei langsam erwache, sehe ich noch undeutlich, wie hinter einem Schleier, so wie die Dinge bei einem überkonzentrierten und hypnotischen Blick erscheinen, dass ihm der Revolver aus der Hand sinkt. Dann erscheint noch für einen Augenblick eine Tür mit der Aufschrift "Grusssitten nach Stresemann", wobei mir einleuchtet, dass sich die Grusssitten auf die Weise des überlegenen Blicks beziehen, der Name Stresemann aber die Figur des Kanzlers andeuten soll. Im Erwachen fühle ich mich sehr heiter und befreit. Ich habe das Gefühl, mit den elementaren Mächten frei spielen zu können. - In einem vorhergehenden Traum war ich mit Emmi und Tessen-Werner in einem Zimmer ähnlich der elterlichen Wohnung in Schwerin und stellte fest, dass man weit drüben am anderen Ufer in die Zimmer der erleuchteten Häuser einblicken konnte. Es war eine hoher Genuss in dieser Überdeutlichkeit, und die Situation hatte ein wenig von der Atmosphäre des van Goghschen Bildes einer erleuchteten Nacht, in der unendliche Lichter sich in einem grossen Wasser spiegeln.

Dabei Szenenwechsel: wie auf einem Bahnhof. Beinahe hätte ich dem Kellner in der Enge das Tablett aus der Hand gestossen. - Ursel G. findet auf ihrem Sitzplatz Emmis Handtäschchen* und Portemonnaie. Dort finde ich den vierten Pfennig. Auf meinem Platz findet sich ein sehr hübsches Handtäschchen und ein Elfenbeingegenstand. Ich stecke es ein, um später die Besitzerin ausfindig zu machen. Am Ende ist mir das peinlich. - Auf dem Bahnhof musste ich noch allerhand in den Koffer packen. Dadurch droht das Frachtgeld teurer zu werden. Es war an sich erstaunlich billig.

Gisela marschiert in ihrem Zug in einem der ersten Glieder. Sie kuckt ganz starr nach vorne und hört unser Rufen nicht, und ihre Augen sind mit Tränen gefüllt. Dann laufen wir hinterher und dann ist sie selig. Hinterher noch Gespräche über den Koffer mit dem Vater. Jeder der Tonklumpen hat den Namen eines Schutzheiligen. Bloss einer fehlt, er ging nicht mehr in den Koffer, aber dieser Schutzheilige passt auch nicht für die Wanderschaft in der fremdem Stadt. Darum sagt der Vater, war es ganz richtig, dass er nicht mitkam. - Der Koffer war ein gelber Lederkoffer und ich kriegte ihn kaum zu.

Schon der Gedanke, da herab springen zu müssen, ist mir furchtbar. (Angst immer noch Nachwirkung des Coffeins). - Ein Pferd will mich beissen. - Ein Hausmeister verteilt das Essen. Ich helfe ihm. Für mich bleibt nichts übrig. Ich bin enttäuscht, denn ich habe Hunger. Er winkt mich zu sich und überreicht mir eine grosse Tüte Bonbons. Indem er einen herausnimmt und mir schenkt, deutet er an, dass ich die anderen bezahlen soll. Ich kaufe sie- wider Willen - denn Bonbons zu kaufen lässt meine wirtschaftliche Lage garnicht zu, und ich hätte lieber etwas richtiges zu essen. (Symbolbedeutung für das gehemmte sexuelle Habenwollen) - In einer anderen Traumszene in einem Bücherladen schenkt mir der Verkäufer drei Stück Kuchen für mich und Herrn Specht (Wir kauften gestern Nachmittag Kuchen in einem Bäckerladen, in dem allerdings nur Verkäuferinnen waren, - und assen ihn zu dem Kaffee.) - Der Verkäufer sagt, dass dies Geschenk ihm garnichts ausmache, dass es auch garnicht weiter zu bewerten sei. Er zeigt uns und anderen ein Kofferradio, das er sich gekauft hat. Er entlockt ihn immer andere Musik, indem er den Finger immer an einer anderen Stelle an die Antenne hält. (An unseren Schreibtisch ist ein Draht gespannt, um die Beine zusammen zu halten, der immer andere Töne gibt, wenn man ihn zupft wie eine Saite - je nachdem, ob man den Draht länger oder kürzer hält.) - Aus dem Kofferradio kommt von allen Sendern nur Tanzmusik, obgleich ich gerne schwere Musik gehört hätte. - In dem Traum klangen auch die Strassenverhältnisse aus dem nächtlichen Traum von Krischan und Rosmarie wieder an.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0272 (1950-06-24 - Göttingen)Ein anderer Traum in Filmform, den ein Professor erfunden hat. Die Gesichter sind alle bewusst energisch und etwas bürgerlich steif gezeichnet. Es handelt sich um einen Mann, der einem moderne Grossinquisitor in die Hände fällt und mit einer scheusslichen Krankheit vergiftet werden soll. Die Assistentin aber, die mit einem kleine Messerchen den Mann mit Bazillen heimlich impfen soll, ritzt stattdessen damit den Grossinquisitor, obgleich dieser sich bis zum äussersten wehrt und selbst versucht, mit einem anderen Messer zuvor das Mädchen auf dieselbe Weise ausser Kampf zu setzen. Als aber seine Haut mit dem Messer berührt ist, schlägt er sofort den Kragen hoch, lehnt sich zurück und erwartet den Tod. Man sieht und hört, wie ihn die Vorstellung rauschenden Blutes an seinem Arm quält. Dann aber kommt er auf die satanische Idee, durch einen Kuss den Mann, den er vergiften wollte, nun doch noch anzustecken. Auch dieser zeigt sofort Erschlaffung und Verzerrung und äussert Angst davor, die Pest bekommen zu haben. Zuletzt steckt er ihm noch seine eigene angerauchte Zigarre in den Mund, um so die Infektion zu vollenden. (178 words)

Sie ist die Frau eines Diplomaten. Als nächstes kommt ein Soldat, der alles zerstören will, was sie heilgelassen hat. Aber auch er ist gebildet und erzählt mir von der "Germanistik" in einem Nachbarstaat, eine Art von "Deutschem Institut". Wir befinden uns in einem slavischen Land.Ich breche aus, werde verfolgt und suche mein rotes Auto. Hier wache ich allmählich auf, setze aber den Traum fort, bis er zuletzt in Gedanken übergeht. Obwohl ich weiss, dass es eigentlich unwahrscheinlich ist, träume ich die Flucht so zu Ende, dass mein Auto schneller ist als alle anderen und immer im letzten Moment in totaler Fahrt den Verfolgern noch entrinnen kann, bis es die deutschen Linien erreicht. Ich wechsle mich beim Steuern mit meinem Chauffeur ab. Eine russische Offiziersmütze, die ich zur Sicherung mitnehme, werfe ich hinaus, bevor ich in die deutschen Linien komme.

Dort sitzen Andere, die nicht gestört werden dürfen, in der Halle beim Essen, unter ihnen Christian und Dieter. (72 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0296 (1950-07-23 - Göttingen)Ich wachte gestern vor dem Einschlafen noch einmal mit einem Fall-Schreck auf, weil ich mich nicht wie gewöhnlich auf die rechte sondern auf die linke Seite gelegt hatte. Der Schreck bestand darin, dass ich auf ein Siel in der Strasse trat, das meinem Tritt nachgab, wobei es sich sozusagen um seine eigene Achse drehte und mein Fuss zu versinken drohte. Solche Traumbilder sind bei mir häufig. (66 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0297 (1950-07-24 - Göttingen)Traum von meinem Vater, den ich ein zweites mal in seiner Krankheit pflegen musste. Er stand vor dem Wasser, das in Sprüngen auf der elektrischen Platte kochte, und wartete, dass es noch heisser würde, um sich damit zu waschen. Er gestattete mir nicht, den Kontakt zu lösen, obwohl die Zeit knapp war und auch ich mich selber waschen musste. (59 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0299 (1950-07-24 - Göttingen)Später Traum von Nicolai Hartmann. Er hielt seine Vorlesung. Aber wegen eines Unfalls stand er in Filzpantoffeln. Ich ging mit einem Mädchen in den Hörsaal und setzte mich ganz vorne hin. Ein Kanon wurde gesungen, den Hartmann etwas unbeholfen mit heiserer Stimme dirigierte. Später kam Christian. Er musste über Hartmanns Beine steigen, die dieser beim Sitzen in den Gang gestellt hatte. Er dachte offenbar, die Vorlesung hätte noch nicht angefangen, weil alles so legèr war. (75 words)

Ich bin allein im Wagen, in dem als einzigem kein Gaslicht, sondern eine anderes brennt. Ich überlege einen Moment, ob ich mich im Klo einschliessen solle. Tue es aber nicht, weil dort entdeckt zu werden, wegen der Offensichtlickeit des Versteckens die sichere Verhaftung bringen würde. Ich gehe ganz nach vorne in dem Zug in der Hoffnung, dass die Lokomotive schon auf deutschen Boden steht. Der Zug steht auf der Oderbrücke. - Vorher Traum von einer Eisenbahnfahrt in Afrika. Die meisten Menschen gehen in die völlig offenen Wagen. Ich ziehe den gedeckten wegen des Schattens vor. Ich habe einen Schein, von dem ich nicht genau weiss, ob er ein Geldschein oder ein Fahrschein ist. Der eingeborene Schaffner identifiziert ihn als Fahrschein. - Von hier ging dann der Traum wohl in den zuerst beschriebenen über. Dazwischen noch ein Bindeglied. Ich sitze allein im Wagen und habe keinen richtigen Fahrschein. - Ich lenke den Schaffner durch ein Gespräch über die gaslose Beleuchtung ab. Auch handelt es sich darum, dass ich in diesem Wagen ja kein Gasgeld zu bezahlen brauche und dadurch irgendwie gerechtfertigt bin. (190 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0304 (1950-07-30 - Göttingen)Später Traum von Lehmann, dem ich lange in die Augen schaute. Er erlaubte mir, einer Probe zuzuhören, und machte mich damit sehr glücklich. Ich lag im Bett, von einem Wandschirm umgeben, durch dessen Ritze er während dieses Gesprächs guckte, denn er sass nebenan in einem Sessel. Diese Situation war dadurch entstanden, dass die Probe in demselben Raum stattfand, in dem ich auch übernachtete. (Übrigens hatte die Räumlichkeit im Traum auch etwas Ähnlichkeit mit der des Jungenszimmers in unserer Schweriner Wohnung, und ich sagte zu Lehmann: In diesem Zimmer habe ich vor Jahren schon geschlafen.)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0307 (1950-08-01 - Göttingen)Ich war im Traum mit Goethe und Ernst Jünger zusammen. Doch entwickelte sich dabei dieser aus jenem. Um andere Traumbilder wurde ich betrogen, da ich von ihrer Niederschrift nur träumte. Zuletzt Gespräch mit dem Grossherzog über den Roggower. Jetzt fällt mir ein. Es handelte sich bei den anderen Träumen um eine Arbeitssituation. Verdichtung aus HJ-Dienst und Gartenarbeit in Wittmoldt. Eine allgemeine Grosszügigkeit war eingerissen, die durch einen neuen Fanatiker rückgängig gemacht wurde. Bei der Arbeit handelte es sich darum, dass ich meine Kleider, besonders mein Leinenhemd, weiss anstreichen musste (so eben wie ich neulich meine Sandalen weisste). Dazu wurden sie zuerst mit Fett eingerieben, damit die Farbe besser haftete (Sexualakzent - weiss nur nicht wie. Man hat aber hier ein leise mitschwingendes Gefühl dieser Bedeutung). (125 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0308 (1950-08-02 - Göttingen)Viele Träume von dem Zimmer, in dem ich schlief und dem Vorgelände, in das ich herauszugehen suchte: Immer handelte es sich darum, dass ich die Augen nicht öffnen konnte - und noch jetzt schmerzen mir die Augen. Und das alles während mir die Morgensonne auf den Kopf schien - um 6 Uhr. (Christian hatte mir schon oft von dieser Art des Weckens erzählt. Ich hatte mich darauf gefreut - aber keinen Angsttraunm erwartet.- (vgl. den zweiten Traum der Nacht, s.u.: Traum 309) - Auch Träume von Franz, der mich gestern Abend besuchte. Er hatte ebensolche kleinen bunten Handschuhe, wie mir Gisela einmal schenkte. Ich fürchtete, auch meine kämen von ihm (Bild der Eifersucht). - Dann träumte ich noch, meine Wirtin hätte mir den Kaffee gebracht, und als ich ihn getrunken hatte, entdeckte ich, dass es noch ganz früh war, und es tat mir leid, nicht wieder einschlafen zu können. Auch träumte ich, dass ich meine gewaschenen Strümpfe auf dem Handtuchständer in die Sonne stellen wollte.

Ich merke es daran, dass die Tür zum Arbeitsraum, in den ich gerade gehen will, von selber aufspringt, so dass noch ein Begleiter zu mir sagt: "Siehst Du, die Tür geht extra für Dich auf". Dann aber höre ich das Gehen der Bibliothekstür, deren Luftdruck die andere mit geöffnet hatte, und gleichzeitig mit der Angst um den unerlaubten Einbruch in die mir anvertrauten Räume kommt mir der Gedanke, dass ja nur dieser eine Eingang besteht und mir der Einbrecher unfehlbar in die Arme laufen muss.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0317 (1950-08-10 - Göttingen)Träumte von Lehmann. Er wollte mich im Autobus mitnehmen. Gisela hatte es vermittelt. Ich hatte noch ein Stück Strasse zu laufen bis zur Abfahrt und die Zeit war knapp. Ich fragte einen Strassenpassanten nach dem Weg und er unterrichtete mich gut. An der nächsten Ecke bei dem Turm sei es. (Ich ging gestern einen anderen, mir noch ziemlich unbekannten Weg nach Hause, der mir ziemlich lang erschien. Gisela war gestern bei Lehmann) Aber ich konnte plötzlich nicht ordentlich laufen, als wenn ich steife Beine hätte. Aber ich wusste, dass das in solchen Fällen oft so sei bei mir, und rief das noch den Passanten zu. (Obwohl ich nicht wusste, dass ich im Traum sei, hatte ich doch hier eine Erinnerung, die typisch aus der Traumsphäre stammt. Die Continuität der Traumwelt) Schliesslich sah ich ein Personenauto mit der Aufschrift Fritz Lehmann an der Tür. (Es war sein Volkswagen - doch fällt mir zur Aufschrift der Name ein, der immer an dem Wagen des Dr. Brenkle steht,. nach dessen Auto ich gestern Ausschau hielt, weil meine Verdienstmöglichkeit sich erst bei seiner Rückkunft entscheidet.) Übrigens zu dem Laufen mit steifen Beinen: als ich einmal tief Luft holte und mich locker machte, ging es wieder besser und ich dachte : es ist also doch psychogen (Dazu fällt mir ein meine Neigung zu Krämpfen, die vorgestern bei der Fussmassage immer auftraten und bei denen mir klar wurde, dass psychogene Faktoren starken lösenden und verstärkenden Einfluss darauf haben können.) Schliesslich fand ich noch den Autobus und setzte mich hinein. (So wie gestern, als ich bei der Filmgesellschaft nach Hause fuhr). Dann setzt sich rechts neben mir ein Mädchen, und ich fragte sie, ob sie auch lieber den Fensterplatz haben wollte. - Dann noch Träume vom Schlittenfahren, wo die Jungens sich immer alle gegenseitig überfuhren. Es war halb wie ein Schauerfilm. Ich wusste, dass es nicht so ernst war (Gestern im Autobus fürchtete ich manchmal Zusammenstösse. Misstrauen. Gehemmtes Hingabebedürfnis, Angst.) Schliesslich ein kleiner Junge, der Angst hatte und den ich mit Obst tröstete. Zuletzt kam ich mit dem Obst in Roggow (zugleich Wittmoldt) auf die Diele. Feeli war auch dabei. Wir deckten die unerlaubt gepflückten Bickbeeren mit Äpfeln zu und gingen fix hindurch. Es war gerade Andacht. (Sie wurde in Roggow auf der Diele gehalten. Feeli ist aber in Wittmoldt. Hier also die beiden Güter verdichtet). (389 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0320 (1950-08-13 - Göttingen)Muddings Tod und danach Vaddings Tod (In Wirklichkeit starb Vadding Schultz vor Mudding Schultz). Vadding war aber während Muddings Tod krank und hatte einen Pfleger, einen Gefangenen mit gefesselten Händen, der sehr ungehobelt war. Dann aber hatte er sich wieder erholt und erledigte alles, was notwendig war nach Muddings Tod. Er war stark und kurz wie ein Dragoner. Ich bot ihm meine Hilfe an, aber er wollte alles allein machen. Ich sagte, das sei sehr sympathisch. Dann war die Überlegung, wie Emmi ihn versorgen und gleichzeitig bei uns im Schlossgarten bleiben konnte. Sie wollte ein Zimmer in der Stadt mieten und dort zeitweilig wohnen Sie fuhr ihm Essen in einem Behälter hin. Es wurde viel zu viel eingeladen, und ich wurde dabei mit einer weissen, halbflüssigen Masse, ähnlich Becamell-Kartoffen begossen. (Bild der Ejakulation). Ich nahm es gelassen hin. -. Dann war auch Vadding tot und ich in seiner Wohnung und empfing dort Besuch von vielen Bekannten, die ich einander und meiner später kommenden Schwester vorstellen sollte. Ich brachte aber alle Namen durcheinander. (Ich hatte Gisela vorgestern die Genese des Namenskomplexes erzählt - uneheliches Kind). - Ich nahm es aber nicht tragisch. Ein Mädchen küsste mich. Ich wachte auf.- Fortsetzung des Traums nach dem Einschlafen: Franzens und mein Zimmer liegen in zwei Häusern nebeneinander, und zwar merke ich plötzlich, dass ich in seine Mansarde Einblick habe, wenn er das Licht einschaltet. ich sehe seine Bewegungen auch im Spiegel. Ich stehe am Fenster mit der Front zu ihm. Er spricht beim Hantieren leise vor sich hin. Das Dienstmädchen hat irgend etwas falsch oder ungeschickt hingelegt. Schliesslich sage ich leise aber mit tiefer und etwas unheimlicher Stimme: "Guten Morgen". Er erschrickt etwas und schreibt das Gehörte dann irgendwie dem Dienstmädchen zu. Dann gehet das Licht aus. Ich wundere mich erst und begreife dann, dass er nun hinausgegangen ist, weil Gisela ihn abgeholt hat zu der Tour, die sie heute am Sonntag machen wollen (320 words)

Beide hatten mich zu einem Aussprachekreis eingeladen und beide zur gleichen Zeit (um Halb-Vier). Ich schwankte lange, zu wem ich gehen sollte, und entschied mich dann für Brückner, weil ich bei ihm am längsten nicht gewesen war und Hoffmann das am besten plausibel machen konnte. Dann ging ich mit Anderen in die Kirche, wo es sein sollte. Ich schwankte aber noch beim Eingang ins Mittelschiff. Die anderen wollten schräg hinten ins Seitenschiff gehen, weil von dort hinten der Vortrag auf englisch käme. Ich beschloss, schnurgerade auf meinen alten Platz zu gehen an den Tisch, wo ich vorhin schon gesessen hatte. Es handelte sich um Träume vom Essen in Kaffees u. s. w., die vorausgegangen waren, auch ein Gemeinschaftessen, das der Kurator leitete, kam dort vor. Nach dem Essen sammelten sich seine Bekannten zwanglos, sozusagen von selbst um ihn. Ich dachte, was hat der Mann für 'nen grossen Einfluss, war aber nicht dabei. Am Ende des Traums von der Kirche Erwachen vom Weckerklingeln. - Vor allem noch ein Traum vom Gang durchs Werderholz bis zum Stadteingang. Tore wie beim Eutiner Schlosspark. (Ich sprach gestern Abend mit Beuermann von Eutin). Frage des kürzesten Weges. Breiter Waldweg voller Pfützen, die ich in grossen mühelosen Sprüngen, die grosse Lust bereiteten, vermied.

Man ist schon in einem fortgeschrittenen Stadium, in dem man die Dinge sehr sachlich nimmt. Zuweilen sieht man das Ankommen der Granatsplitter in langen feinen Bahnen vorher aufblitzen. Mein Bruder liegt neben mir und wird am rechten Zeigefinger getroffen. Aber es ist nur eine feine weisse Staubmasse, die sich um den Finger sofort am Boden bildet. Sieht aus wie weisse Schlämmkreide. Ich sage: Rausziehen. Er zieht sofort den Finger weg, und es ist nichts passiert. - Entstanden war der Angriff dadurch, dass ein Radio in einem Auto am Waldrand überhaupt angestellt wurde. Kinder hatten es getan. Ich sprach jedoch mit ihnen und hatte ihnen verboten, mit dem Auto zu spielen. Nach dem Erwachen dachte ich aber, ich hätte es getan, und wollte es darum zuerst am liebsten garnicht aufschreiben. (137 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0328 (1950-08-23 - Göttingen)Traum (Zweiter Traum) Ich wollte ein altes photokopiertes Buch abschreiben und ging dazu regelmässig in die Arbeitsräume eines grossen alten patrizischen Handelshauses. Einmal hörte ich eine Unterredung an des alten Seniorchefs mit seiner erwachsenen Tochter, die ein ausschweifendes Leben führte. Er sagte: Dann hätte ich noch eher verstanden, wenn Du zu diesem Man gegangen wärst, aber dass Du ihn in unser Haus gebracht hast, ist unmöglich. Es handelte sich um irgend einen berüchtigten Mann. Einmal, als ich nach einer kleinen Pause wieder reinkomme, höre ich, wie der Kontorvorsteher einem Mann sagt: Den Platz können Sie nicht besetzen. Da sitzt doch Herr v. Uslar. Ich bleibe halb verblüfft vor der Tür stehen. Als er mich sieht, kriege ich einen Tadel, weil ich draussen lausche. Später ist es eine Bibliothek. Gisela kommt zu mir (altes Traumthema!). Sie geht ein bisschen derb mit einem der - nein so war das nicht, sie erwartete, dass der Hausmeister ihr jederzeit eins der Bücher gibt und sagt zur Begründung: Es ist doch extra für mich von einer anderen Bibliothek hierher ausgeliehen. (Einfall: Beuermanns Buch-Abschreiben in der Bach-Ausstellung) - Später ist die Bibliothek gleichzeitig auch mein Zimmer. - Dann bin ich im Gebirge. Ein Hang wird befestigt, der sonst in der Schneeschmelze immer weggeschwemmt wird. (vgl. Thema des matschigen Weges im gestrigen Traum!) Man zieht lange hölzerne Ablaufrinnen, um das Wasser zu lenken. Dann sehe ich viele Männer und Frauen in Badehosen auf einer sonnigen Wiese sich tummeln. Eine Frau trägt nur eine Hose. Ich sehe sie, die sehr unbefangen ist, etwas verstohlen an. Dann kommt ein grosser rotbrauner Windhund und will mich beissen. Doch ich nehme es mehr wie ein Spiel, kriege dann aber doch Angst, weil er meine Hände fest zwischen den Zähnen hält. Als ich aufwache, liegt der Hund immer noch neben mir. Ich bin erstaunt und reisse die Augen auf. Es ist meine rote Bettdecke, auf die die erste Morgensonne scheint. (318 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0330 (1950-08-24 - Göttingen)Kauf von Teegebäck in einer sehr bedienungslahmen Bäckerei. Emmi, von der ich vorher schon geträumt hatte, dass sie in meiner Stube kochte, hatte mir aufgetragen, Anisplätzchen und anderes auszusuchen. Während ich dort stand, umfasste mich ein Mädchen, mit gelähmtem Unterkörper, um sich an mir hoch zu ziehen, und liess sich dann in meinen ausgestreckten Arm gleiten, so dass ich ihre Schultern umfasste und sie hinaus geleiten konnte. Sie hatte eine schöne Figur und war elegant angezogen. An der Tür holte sie ein Mann ab. Sie sagte, wenn sie keinen Stock habe, müsse sie sich stützen lassen. Das eine gelähmte Bein war sehr schmal und unbekleidet. Es war nach innen gedreht. Ich nickte ihr zu und schaute in sehr schöne blaue Augen. Dann wollte ich den Kuchenkauf beenden, doch die Bedienung war inzwischen noch nicht einen Schritt weiter gekommen. Ich sagte: Hier ist ein Saubetrieb. Ich trug einen schweren Rucksack, den ich nun ablegte. Auch zog ich meine schwarze Jacke und den blauen Rollkragenpullover aus. Doch weil ich Hosenträger trug (das ist so bei dem alten schwarzen Anzug, den ich übrigens jetzt nie mehr trage), hängte ich die Jacke wieder um. Der ganze Traum hatte übrigens damit angefangen, dass ich in meinem Bett lag und die elektrischen Schnüre auf meinem Nachttisch durcheinander gekommen waren, so dass die Geräte teilweise über mir in der Luft hingen. Dann kam Emmi und baute ihre Kochplatte auf den Nachttisch. Es war mir garnicht recht, weil ich gerade beim Essen war und das Essen nun kalt wurde. Ich nahm das anscheinend sehr wichtig. - Vor allem dem, glaube ich, waren Pferdeträume, doch kann es auch sein, dass die Erinnerung an den Film trügt, den ich gestern abend mit Gisela sah, in dem viele Pferde vorkamen.

Zuletzt hängte er es an einen vorne abgebrochenen Haken. Vorher Ersteigen enger Treppen in dem kleinen Einfamilienhäuschen. Ich war eine Treppe zu hoch gestiegen. Da sass das Mädchen (vielleicht ein zwölfjähriges, in Jacke und dreiviertel langen Hosen, beide braun kariert) und nahm mit grosser Lässigkeit seine langen Beine zur Seite, damit ich die Treppe weitergehen konnte. Daraus folgte die Nägelszene. Vor dem allen schon vielfache Träume von Reisen und Gastgebern, mit Länger-Bleiben und Später-Fahren, in denen sich Göttingen und Wittmoldt, Bülows und frühere Gastgeber, Giselas Wohnung und Frau Heitmüller vielfach verquickten. Gisela gab mir noch im Wegfahren einen Rat, was ich zu Frau Heitmüller, ihrer Wirtin, sagen sollte, um noch ein paar Tage länger in der Stube hausen zu können. (156 words)

Es kommt mir unheimlich vor. Da kommt auch schon die Gestalt auf mich zu, bedroht mich und beginnt, mich zu würgen. Ich erkenne ein schizophrenes Mädchen. Ich ringe lange mit ihr und bringe sie allmählich zur Ruhe. Als erstes riss sie meine Schlipsnadel mit dem gewunden Goldknoten und den zwei Perlen heraus, versuchte sie zu zerbrechen und warf sie auf den Rasen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0338 (1950-09-01 - Wittmoldt)Abends. Bei einem Selbstgespräch über meinen Zustand nickte ich ein. Der imaginäre Partner war Gisela -- ich sitze viel in der Sonne, bade, lese und ruhe mich aus. Nur zuweilen stolpere ich über irgend eine Erinnerung wie über einen ausgespannten Faden. Hier ist ja nichts, was mich nicht an Dich erinnert und schmerzt. Aber das ist nur im ersten Moment so. Hier sind aber auch grosse Kräfte aufgespeichert, von denen ich mir Kraft hole. Ich sehe einen Hahn, der angezapft wird. Vorstellung: Im letzten Moment fuhr ich hierher, um wieder Kraft für meine Sachen zu schöpfen. Überlegung: Woher kommt diese Kraft? Ist es nur Trug der Erinnerung? Nein, es ist wirklich objektive Kraft hier aufgespeichert, zeitlos. Es liegt auch an der Landschaft. Diese Landschaft ist eben anders.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0339 (1950-09-02 - Wittmoldt)Lange Gespräche im Traum mit einem Dichter über seine Werke, das Alte Testament und meine Stellung zur Theologie. Bis ins Einzelste ausgeführt. Ich machte mir Notizen über die Namen der Werke und numerierte diese. Vorher Kriegssituation. Beschiessung. Wir sitzen am Fuss einer Scheune. Durch Lautsprecherpropaganda wird vom Feind eine Beschiessung bekannt gegeben. Unter anderem: "Der Tee-Club da am Fuss der Scheune wird auch bald nicht mehr sein". Wir stieben auseinander. -- Dann Stadt am Ufer eines Sees. Ich bewundere ein Blockhaus. Dann ein tiefer kellerartiger Schacht, in dem unten eine Wasserleitung läuft. Er war repariert worden, weil die Leitung nicht funktionierte. Ich gehe mit Dieter dort hin. Die Leute sind noch am Saubermachen von den Bauarbeiten. Man muss sich das so vorstellen, dass diese Quelle oder Leitung unterhalb eines Hauses liegt, das auf die Steilküste und in die Steilküste hinein gebaut ist. Es ist vielleicht mehr ein Kamin als ein Schacht. (151 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0340 (1952-09-03 - Wittmoldt)Mancherlei Träume, in denen einmal auch das Autogene Training eine Rolle spielte, doch sozusagen negativ vorgeführt: Die Kiefer wurden ganz fest aufeinander gepresst. Ich musste selbst im Traum darüber lachen. Dann das eigene Leibbewusstsein in vielerlei Abstufungen und Bildern, die mir schon im Halbwachen als solche deutlich wurden. Ich sonnte mich und badete gestern nackend und empfand das stärkere Innewerden des eigenen Körpers dabei wohltuend. Auch wurde mir zwischen diesen Träumen deutlich, wie sehr alle unsere Träume auch Leiberlebnisse sind. Man sollte solches Baden und Sonnen auch zur Heilung verwenden, denn diese Körpernähe verschafft einen Kontakt zur Realität, der vielen heilsam werden könnte. Die Hitze spannte ein Tuch um mich, aus Sonnenstrahlen gewoben, und zuletzt glitt ich wie ganz von selbst ins Wasser, das mich nahtlos umschloss. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0341 (1950-09-03 - Wittmoldt)Ein anderer Traum von meiner goldenen Uhr, jedoch nicht die, von welcher ich in Krischans Stube einmal träumte, dass ich sie aufgegessen hätte, sondern die andere, die ich früher trug und in der letzten Zeit neben meinem Bett aufhängte und die ich eigentlich Gisela mitgeben wollte und, da sie das nicht mochte, ihr versprach, beim (Aufstehen - Fehlleistung! -:) Aufziehen immer an sie zu denken. Diese Uhr überschlug im Traum zuweilen die Stunde. Zuletzt gebärdete sich der Stundenzeiger ganz eigenwillig, ging vor und rückwärts pendelnd, ganz gleichgültig gegen die Richtung der Zeit, ohne dass ich etwas daran ändern konnte. Es ist sehr reizvoll, wenn dann gegen Morgen einem solche Träume wieder einfallen und man dann plötzlich ihren Sinn errät. Jetzt fällt mir ein, dass ich dann auch von einer dritten goldenen Uhr noch träumte, die durch mehrfache Deckel verschlossen war. Das alles stand im Zusammenhang mit Mudding Schultz, also einem Menschen aus meiner Kinderzeit. Auch war die Entdeckung mehr wie ein Wiederfinden. Ebenfalls sah ich das silberne Empire-Gefäss, das meine Mutter Mudding (Emmis Mutter) schenkte und diese dann später an mich. (181 words)

Der Alligator hat vier Beine, mit Krallen bewehrte Klauen und sieht im übrigen aus wie ein Hund. Auf der Flucht vor der Schlange gerate ich vor den Alligator. Noch am letzten Ende eines Zweiges schwebend frage ich Christian, ob der Alligator mir gefährlich sei, und höre von hinten seine Antwort: "Kaum, denn jetzt ist er gerade mit dem Eichhörnchen beschäftigt". Ich lasse mich fast lautlos auf die Erde nieder, aber sofort kommen beide Tiere auf mich zu. Ich schaue scharf dem Alligator in die Augen, um ihn zu bannen, und gehe nun immer rückwärts. Er unterhält sich mit mir und gibt mir zuweilen seine Krallen-bewehrte Klaue, aber so vorsichtig, dass mir nichts passiert. Zuletzt lange ich, so rückwärts gehend, bei der Terrasse des Hauses an. Die Silberpappel hatte da gestanden, wo hier die grossen Linden an der Auffahrt stehen, und der Weg war am Ufer des Sees entlang gegangen. Nun gibt er mir zum Abschied noch einmal die Hand und vor allen Leuten kratzt er mich dabei noch ordentlich mit den Krallen. (193 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0345 (1950-09-07, 05:30 - Wittmoldt)Spaziergang mit Nicolai Hartmann. Er erzählte über seine Arbeit. Er wäre magenkrank, darum könnte er immer erst spät zu Bett gehen. (Ich hatte gestern Abend Magenschmerzen!) Das störte ihn oft bei der Arbeit. Ich wäre ja ganz gesund, ich müsse noch mehr arbeiten. Dann von einem Philosophen, der ihn sehr beeinflusst habe namens Beisinger. Später Begegnung mit Kamlah, der strahlend von einem sehr guten Philosophen Beisinger erzählte. Ich sagte ihm, was Hartmann mir eben gesagt hatte. -- Anderer Traum: Begegnung mit Herrn Rosswoge (Theaterwissenschaftler und Volontär im Filmatelier). Er sprach mich an und bestätigte mir, was ich schon durch einen Brief wusste, dass im Augenblick bei den Dreharbeiten das Zuschauen nicht möglich sei. Dann Frage, wie ich dazu gekommen sei: "Wie lange sind Sie eigentlich schon beim Wiederholen?" Ich: "Wiederholen? Wieso?" Er: "Was haben Sie denn studiert, wie lange haben Sie Sport studiert?" Ich erzähle ihm nun genau die Entwicklung meines Studienganges und, dass ich Sport nicht studiert, sondern dort nur Volkstänze gelernt hätte. Während ich noch die Semesterzahlen für die einzelnen Gebiete ausrechnete, wachte ich auf und rechnete automatisch weiter, bis ich zu dem Ergebnis kam: (187 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0347 (1950-09-08 - Wittmoldt)Sah heute im Traum einen geradezu genialen Film. Auch Gisela, die genau hinter mir sass, war immer wieder begeistert. Den Titel habe ich leider vergessen. Letzte Szene: Ein Mann, der lange mit einer Besatzung irgendwo in Afrika gelegen hat, wird im Luftschloss (Fehlleistung!) Luftschiff abgeholt. Im letzten Moment steigt er völlig erschöpft ein und sinkt im Schlaf zusammen. Als er erwacht, befindet sich der Zeppelin schon in der Luft. Man spürt das leise Schwanken der Kabine, hört ein undeutliches Durcheinanderschwirren der Stimmen, eine Frau, die von ihren Träumen spricht: "Da war plötzlich so ein Gitterberg ... . Hoffentlich tritt das alles nicht wieder ein." Andere Stimmen. Es leuchtet ihm ein: Es ist ja Krieg. Die Frau hat von einer Artilleriebeschiessung geträumt. Das Luftschiff nähert sich jetzt einer Stadt. Man sieht die Dächer ganz dicht unter sich. Es geht immer tiefer, dann wieder plötzlich hoch, so dass die ganze Szenerie schief steht. Plötzlich bemerkt er, dass das Schiff schon zwischen den Häusern in den Strassen fliegt. Warum nur? In unglaublichen Wendungen windet es sich durch. Wie wird es aus dem Schacht wieder herauskommen? Dann plötzlich steil hoch -- man sieht die Frauen, die aus dem Fenster gucken, entsetzt die Augen aufreissen. Aber es ist gut gegangen. Sofort sucht das Schiff einen neuen Schutz. Und jetzt erkennt er oben in der Luft die Geschwader feindlicher Flugzeuge. Haben sie das Luftschiff schon entdeckt? Die ganze Gefahr wird ihm bewusst. Einen Augenblick Totenstille. Man hört nur das Ticken der Uhr. Gisela flüstert hinter mir: "Fabelhaft". Ich habe Angst, die anderen Kinobesucher zu stören, aber sage dann zu ihr: "Ja, wirklich fabelhaft". Dann eine neue Szene. Man sieht den Vorraum zu einem grossen Ballsaal, durch den die Menschen in leuchtenden Kleidern strömen. Ein drahtiger, schwarzhaariger Tanzmeister zieht mit seiner Partnerin voran. Er hat etwas Zügiges in seinen Bewegungen, die unbedingt überzeugen. Ich stosse Gisela an: Den Schauspieler kenne ich, das ist der Tanzmeister, bei dem ich das Menuett gelernt habe. Von ihm dachte ich immer, dass er Giselas Tanzmeister werden könnte. Dann Erwachen: Ich höre wieder das Ticken der Uhr, die hinter mir auf dem Nachtisch steht. -- Vor diesem allen waren noch andere Traumszenen. Kofferpacken, Aufbruchsituation, knappe Zeit. Zuletzt suchte ich noch den Weg eine Treppe hinauf, der mir beschrieben war. Sie führte bald aus einem alten Fachwerkhaus nach aussen als Freitreppe, die halb im überhängenden Dach verborgen ins Grenzenlose anstieg. Man musste sich bücken, um hochsteigen zu können. Doch verband sich durch das überhängend schützende Dacht das Gefühl der Grenzenlosigkeit mit dem der schützenden Geborgenheit und dem der zügigen Führung, so wie eine Kugel durch den gezogenen Lauf fährt. Dabei hatte man das Gefühl einer steigenden Stetigkeit und des Entdeckens ferner Länder: (Dazu fällt mir ein: "Laufet -- Brüder -- Bäume -- Bahn: Die für mich eindrucksvollste Stelle aus der Neunten Symphonie). Aus dieser Szene ging der Traum vom Luftschiff dann hervor." (479 words)

Gedanke: Gisela stört es vielleicht, dass man auf der Strasse geht. -- So im Traum. Später: Das Haus wurde umgebaut. Sämtliche Treppen waren abgerissen, alle Klosetts abmontiert. (49 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0349 (1950-09-10 - Wittmoldt)Reiseträume: Ungarn, England, Tante Milly, Tante Lu (Kirchberg). Verirren in Strassen einer Stadt. Mischung aus Göttingen und Schwerin. Thema: Parallelstrassen (Nikolausberger-Weg und Willhelm-Weber-Strasse in Göttingen -- so hiessen die Strassen, aber es waren nicht Villen-Strassen wie in Göttingen, sondern Altstadtstrassen wie etwa in Schwerin "der grosse" und "kleine Moor".) Und schräge Verbindungen: Burgstrasse (Schwerin) - die dann zu weit oben mündeten. In dieser Szenerie schläfrige Verwirrung. Dolos Fahrrad, das sie mir geliehen hatte, kann ich plötzlich vor einem Haus zwischen lauter anderen Fahrrädern nicht wiederfinden. Dann Schlafszenen: Ich bin auf einer fremden Couch (wie bei Tante Lu oder Tante Milly) einfach eingeschlafen. Mühseliges Erwachen. (104 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0350 (1950-09-11 - Wittmoldt)Besuch in Wuppertal. Spaziergang mit Gisela. Zwischen Kohlenzügen. Auch das Pflaster ist mit feinem schwarzen Kohlenstaub bedeckt. Gespräch im Hausflur. Gisela sagt: "Nicht so laut. Man kann es hören". Mutter hat gesagt: "Warum schreit der eigentlich immer so? Aber man kann es ja verstehen. Ich muss ihm Speck und Schinken geben, damit er wieder gesund wird." Später Wagenfahrt mit Emmi. Ich nehme ihr die Zügel aus der Hand. Oft muss ich auf der verschneiten Strasse ganz scharfe Kurven nehmen, um niemanden zu überfahren. Das bereitet mir Lust, während es als Zuschauer mich in Angst versetzt haben würde. Ich merke, wie man beim Lenken mit dem Wagen verwächst und von ihm ein Leibgefühl bekommt. (Jaspers). Zuletzt ist es nur noch ein Handwagen, auf dem ich allein einen steilen Berg hinabrolle, während sich die Strasse immer mehr mit Fussgängern füllt. Ich versuche, möglichst viele anzurufen und zu warnen und steure so gut als möglich zwischen ihnen durch. Ein Hund sitzt mitten auf der Strasse. Rechts und links Fussgänger. Ich kann ihn nicht mehr umsteuern, wenn ich nicht Menschen überfahren will. Ich rufe laut: "Hallo, Hund!" Niemand hört mich. Er weicht nicht vom Fleck: Dann nur noch der Gedanke: er wird mich vor Schreck und Schmerz beissen. Nach dem Zusammenprall fühle ich mich völlig erschöpft. Dann kommt die Polizei. Ein weiss gekleideter Beamter ist mir entgegen gekommen. Ich sehe aber ein, dass ich im Unrecht bin, weil mein Wagen keine Bremsen hatte. Der Hund hat das Spielbein gebrochen. Es wird eine Anklage geben. Der Polizist rät: "Sie müssen das vermeiden, auf die Waage zu fahren und -- nicht schon jetzt -- aber, wenn sie auf den Hof kommen, etwas humpeln." Ich fühle mich sehr erschöpft und stütze mich auf Franz, da niemand anders mehr da ist und im Augenblick auch das mir Recht ist. (301 words)

Wir schlafen beide in einem Bett, und zwar jeder mit dem Kopf am anderen Bettende als der Andere. Gerd Grambow will mich besuchen. Er ruft unter dem Fenster. Nächste Szene: Gisela wohnt im selben Häuserblock. Sie beschreibt ihr Zimmer: Genau mir gegenüber im Geviert. Nächste Szene: Gespräch mit der Wirtin. Daraus hervorgehend: Ländliche Situation (ähnlich wie hier). Irgend etwas wird in eine Jauchegrube versenkt. Daraus hervorgehend Schützenplatz-ähnliche Situation. Die Grube nur ein Teil eines holzüberdachten Schuppens. Dort war wohl eine Versammlung. Ich werde mitgenommen. Nächste Szene: Vor dem Bahnhof einer Kleinstadt winkt mir ein Mann. Er kommt mir bekannt vor, ich laufe hin, kann mich aber nicht besinnen. Er begrüsst mich strahlend und selbstverständlich. Ich gucke ihn fragend an. Er zupft mit der Spitze seines Stockes an meinem Pullover. Ich denke, das kann nur Herr Neckelmann sein, der mir Onkel Gerds Sachen, und darunter auch einen Pullover gab. Ich gehe um ihn herum, um ihn besser zu erkennen. Er sagt: "Sie suchen wohl meine Narbe, die ist nicht mehr da. Die ist mit Gamma-Strahlen beseitigt". Nächste Szene: Feeli stapelt Kisten auf (Wieder vereint -- zugleich Kriegssituation. Munitionskisten und Verbandskisten.) Nächste Szene: Eisenbahnstrecke: ich fahre mit einem Anderen zusammen, der den Ehrgeiz hat, schneller zu sein als die Lokomotive, auf einem Art Schienenfahrrad. Gefahr. Anrollende Lokomotiven.

Sie gibt ihm und mir etwas. Nächste Szene: Ich habe in jeder Hand ein dickes Stück Schokolade und kaue eifrig. Dann gehe ich auf ein Klo und Dieter sagt: "Willst Du da essen?" Es ist mir eigentlich ziemlich egal, aber ich gehe wieder heraus, zumal der Ort oben Fenster hat, durch die Dieter und Hans Kurt hereingucken können. (92 words)

Dolo sah einen Glückskäfer in meinem Haar krabbeln. Ich sagte: "Nimm ihn Dir doch!" - "Nein, der muss da bleiben", antwortete sie. Dann sah ich einen Glückskäfer von meinem Finger zu ihr über kriechen. Ich sagte: "Guck mal, da kriecht er zu Dir über". - "Oh ja", sagte sie, "da ist ja noch einer".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0356 (1950-09-16 - Wittmoldt)Brief von Gisela: "Ich bin nur noch Sonnabendnachmittag in Göttingen. Zu Dir kommen kann ich wahrscheinlich nicht, denn ich will nicht noch eine Nacht in diesem abgebrochenen Gemach bleiben. Darum habe ich gedacht, dass ich alle zu mir zum Tee einlade. Abends zum Weiterfahren holt Mutter mich dann ab. Vielleicht komme ich aber auch Montag. Du weißt, dass ich die Montag-Abende liebe. Du kannst dann also kommen, wann Du durch die Post den Tag erfährst." Ich wachte auf, unglücklich darüber, dass ich nur noch einer von allen sei: Der Satz: "Zu Dir kommen kann ich wahrscheinlich nicht" war innerhalb des Briefes eigentlich wie ein Gesprächsstückchen -- so, dass ich den Brief bis dahin las -- im Lesen die Bitte äusserte: "Dann kannst Du zu mir kommen" und dann die Antwort vernahm: "Wahrscheinlich nicht...", die eben auch so sehr enttäuschte. Interessant ist, wie hier der Brief in die Gesprächsform sich auflöst, da wir ja auch im Wachen aufregenderes in dieser Weise lesen. (161 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0357 (1950-09-16 - Wittmoldt)Gespräche bei der Tafel über einen Propheten und Weltverbesserer. Die Tür öffnet sich. Ein kleiner untersetzter Herr kommt herein, altmodisch gekleidet, mit einer Schädelform wie Oswald Spengler, aber grossen, etwas starren Augen. Er beginnt zu reden. Ich versuche, ihn zu durchschauen und seinen Blick zu fangen. Doch das ist nicht möglich und ich rufe ihm schliesslich ein "Halt" zu. Dann sehe ich Bilder an der Wand. Unter anderem eine grosse Frauengestalt ohne Kleider. Als ich mich in das Bild vertiefen will, fühle ich, wie mir von hinten ein Tuch über den Kopf geworfen wird, und ich werde fortgezogen. Dann öffnet sich das Tuch zu einem Spalt vor den Augen und ich sehe eine wilde schwarze Meergöttin nackend auf einem Pferd auf dem Rücken liegen. Ich erkenne Gisela, die mich von dem Bild fortgezogen hatte, lasse mich auf sie fallen und überdecke sie mit Küssen. Dabei scheine ich zu erwachen, aber küsse auf dem Bauch liegend weiter, was mir vorkommt, meine Arme und alle Gegenstände. Als ich mich aufrichte, sehe ich durch das Fenster draussen in der morgendlichen Dämmerung uniformierte Gestalten auf dem dünnen Eise. Sie scheinen einen Toten zu tragen. Dann erkenne ich an ihren Pelzmützen und den Schulterstücken, die sie tragen, dass es russische Offiziere sind. Die ganze Szene hatte in ihrer kristallenen Lautlosigkeit etwas von den Bildern des Napoleonischen Winterfeldzuges. Andere Männer sehe ich nackend im Wasser schwimmen. Dann hat mich einer der Russen am Fenster entdeckt und ich schütze mich hinter der Mauer, um nicht erschossen zu werden, und beschliesse, mich nun völlig anzukleiden, um allen Kriegsstrapazen gewachsen zu sein.

Ja - , aber er hoffe, dass ich meine Nummer noch sehr verbessern könne. - "Nein, das ist mir viel zu mühsam, denn ich bin jetzt nicht vorbereitet, und vielleicht wird dann die Nummer anstatt besser schlechter". -- Der Lehrer sehr enttäuscht: "Na, wenn Sie nicht wollen -- dann werde ich eben, so lange die Prüfung dauert, bis zum 2. Oktober, kein Wort mehr mit Ihnen sprechen. Ich habe überhaupt viel Komisches von Ihnen gehört. Als Sie in den Bergen waren, kannten Sie meinen Vater nicht mal mit Namen, und da haben Sie immer (den Webetanz?) gepfiffen, so dass keiner heraushören konnte, was gemeint war, und überhaupt: Sie haben angefangen, zu studieren wie alle Anderen und jetzt sind alle Anderen schon etwas geworden und Sie sind noch immer nichts."

Sie sprechen über eine Malaria, die am Ort grassiert, und geraten dabei in Streit. Schliesslich, als ich mich erhoben habe, reisst der Mann sinnlos Papier von einer Rolle, und wirft es in das Becken, bis das Wasser überfliesst. Als ich endlich -- ähnlich wie die Frau ihn davon zu überzeugen suche, dass er aufhören und zum Mindesten warten müsse, bis das Wasser abgeflossen ist, stürzt er wütend auf mich ein und packt mich an den Händen. Ich schicke die Frau fort, die nun zwischen unseren Armen steht und bleibe so ruhig, dass seine Wut in leise Verzweiflung umschlägt. Dann beruhige ich ihn, indem ich seinen Kopf an meine Schulter lege. (134 words)

Eben wollte ich einem auf den Kopf tippen, weil ich an seiner Echtheit zweifelte, und wurde dabei erst der Täuschung inne." Als ich den Satz aufschreiben wollte, merkte ich erst, dass ich noch gar nicht wach war und, als es mir gelang, die Augen zu öffnen, war das Zimmer, in dem ich lag, ganz anders als das, von dem ich geträumt hatte, und es herrschte nicht Dämmerung, sondern helles Tageslicht.

Dabei war es nicht etwa so, dass ich -- noch im Traum - etwas Blaues sah, sondern es war wirklich das Geräusch, das ich wahrnahm und das sich auch im vollen Erwachen nicht änderte, nur dass ich es nicht als Geräusch erkannte, sondern dieses Etwas für eine Farbe hielt. Darum war ich sehr entsetzt, als es dadurch nicht aufhörte, sondern seine Unheimlichkeit behielt, die drohend war. Das dauerte einen Moment, bis es mir klar wurde, dass ich etwas hörte, und dass es die Weckeruhr war. (111 words)

Ich war über den Stacheldrahtzaun geklettert, weil draussen mich drei Hunde bedrängten (zwei zwillingsgleiche und ein anderer). Drinnen bekomme ich sofort mein Strafmandat über DM 1.50, weil es verboten ist, über den Zaun zu klettern. In zügelloser Wut zerreisse ich das Papier und was sonst an Post auf dem Tisch liegt. Ein Brief ist dabei, den ich nicht sofort kaputtkriege. Da sagt Emmi, deren Blick auf die Adresse fällt, da steht von Oertzen-Roggow drauf (das "Falkenau" des Webetanzes.). Zweiter Traum: Ich will in das Haus des Gärtners (Wittmoldt) eindringen. Da fällt mich ein Hund an. Es gelingt mir noch, ihm einen Knüppel ins Gebiss zu stecken, doch versucht er, den Kopf so zur Seite zur drehen, dass er auch noch meine Finger in den Biss bekommt. Als ihm das schon fast gelungen ist, rufe ich laut um Hilfe. Der herbeikommende Schweizer Ivan, ein Pole, der mich immer an den Ballettmeister Krischan aus den "Roten Schuhen" erinnert sagt, ich solle ganz ruhig den Hund auf die Fensterbank setzen, dann werde er mich nicht wieder anspringen.

Er suchte eine Liedmelodie, die auf den Rhythmus di-da-di-da-di-dit passte. Niemand wusste etwas. Ich wies auf das Beethoven-Konzert hin.

Ich kam übrigens durch den Händedruck in Verlegenheit, weil ich einen Teller Suppe, den ich noch nicht aufgegessen hatte, im Bett stehen hatte, die dabei auslaufen konnte. - Andrer Traum: (Nachmittags). Kriegstraum: Ich bin irgendwo völlig allein, mit einem Radio und in zivilen Umständen, und soll eine Stellung verteidigen. Es hat aber gar keinen Sinn, Hilfe anzufordern, weil auch dort, wo man den Befehl erteilt hat, keine Truppen mehr entbehrt werden können. Ich überlege, ob ich schiessen solle, um den Eindruck von Macht zu erwecken, oder ob ich schweigen solle, um den Feind nicht auf mich aufmerksam zu machen. Endlich beschliesse ich, mich angezogen aufs Bett zu legen, überlege aber, ob ich das Radio anlassen solle, um über die Lage orientiert zu bleiben, oder ob ich es ausmachen solle, um mich durch die Ereignisse überraschen zu lassen.

Währenddessen hantiert eine alte Frau auf dem Flur, auf dem ich stehe. Später kommt der Mann alleine wieder, und ehe wir die geschäftlichen Angelegenheiten erledigen, erzähle ich ihm meine merkwürdig gehörte Geschichte. Es ist die Geschichte eines Pfluges, den ein junger Bauer besitzt und in den ein alter Mann sich verliebt hat und ihn nun auf jede Art und Weise zu bekommen sucht.

Dann wiederholte sich die Traumszene noch einmal sozusagen variiert: Es war gleichzeitig ein Heimkehrer aus der Gefangenschaft, ein Offizier, Ernst Jünger. Diesmal hatte er eine Schirmmütze auf.

Ich ging noch während des Angriffs durch die Strassen bis zu einer katholischen Kirche, in der zwei sargartige Tragbahren aufgestellt waren, in deren einer N.N. lag. Ausser mir waren auch noch einige Jungen in der Kirche. Einer von ihnen öffnete neugierig diesen Sarg, den ich bewachte. Der war drinnen mit Krepp-artigen Papier gefüllt, in das die Tote gepackt war. Es war schon etwas vom Blute verklebt und rot gefleckt. Er hob, während ich hineinschaute, die Packung vorne etwas an und die Haut der Stirn mit dem Haaransatz wurde sichtbar. Mich schauderte bei diesem Anblick, der mich doch eigenartig berührte. Dann deckte er alles wieder zu, stopfte das Papier zurecht, und trat, da es nicht reinging, es mit dem Fuss zusammen. Ich bat ihn vorsichtig zu sein. Er sagte, die Angehörigen würden den Sarg doch nicht mehr öffnen. Ich antwortete: "Würdest Du es gerne sehen, wenn die, die Du geliebt hast, auf den Kopf getreten wird?" Er lachte und es gab eine Schlägerei, bei der mich aber mehr die körperliche Leidenschaft als die Kampfwut überkam. In einer anderen Szene hatte ich eine kleine Handorgel, die N.N.'s Eltern, wohl für die Beerdigung, geschickt hatten und die Emmi mir gab. Sie hatte vorne und hinten Tasten und ich spielte zunächst einige Töne darauf, die auf Emmi nur störend wirkten, weil sie keine Melodie ergaben. Dann untersuchte ich das ganze Instrument. Es hatte in seinem Unterbau viele flache Fächer, wie man sie an Nähkästen kennt. Darin waren Grammophonnadeln, X-Hacken und anderes, sorgfältig geordnet. Schliesslich drehte ich das Instrument um und tippte auf die hinteren Tasten, während ich von ferne sehr schöne andere Musik hörte. Die Tasten hatten nur einen ganz geringen Hubraum, als wären sie festgelegt und gaben nur bezaubernde kleine Silbertöne, wie die obersten Tasten eines Cembalo. Ich tippte nur gleichsam wahllos die Tasten an, und sie gaben immer eine wunderbare Begleitung zu der Musik, die ich von ferne hörte. Ich gewann das Instrument sehr lieb und überlegte, ob ich es N.N's Eltern zurückgeben müsse, die es sicher längst vergessen hatten, oder es auch gar nicht zurückhaben wollten. (357 words)

Emmi sagt: "Was soll das Bild überhaupt?" Ich sage: "Oh, da ist ja ein Tiger, ein Tiger in einem Urwald. " Dann sehe ich das Bild plötzlich anders. Die Kapitelle eines klassischen Gemachs. Die anderen Linien kann man nur erraten. Dann wird plötzlich alles immer sicherer. Das Bild springt mir überragender Deutlichkeit heraus (in klarem, glattem Marmor). Einzelne Farbstriche und Kleckse wie vorher sind überhaupt nicht mehr festzustellen.

Das periodische Entschwinden liess mich nur Bruchstücke der Sätze erfassen. Hans Kurt, der im Hintergrund der Stube stand, versuchte mich zu stören und abzulenken. Ich versuchte, mich umso mehr ungespannt und ruhig auf den Brief zu konzentrieren. So wurde das Lesen zu einer Art Sport. Es leuchtete mir ein, dass es sich nur um ein Traumbild handelte, doch suchte ich so viel wie möglich zu erfassen. Ich entsinne mich noch des Wortes "Homburg". (117 words)

Ich hatte mich sekundär und fast unwissend an einem Messingdiebstahl beteiligt. Ich wurde von der Polizei ausgefragt, aber so, dass ich ohne direkt etwas falsches zu sagen, doch über alles was ich wusste, nichts auszusagen brauchte und so auch meine kleine Ungenauigkeit verschweigen konnte. Doch jedesmal, wenn ich an dem kleinem Laden vorbeikam, der dem Dieb gehörte, und jedesmal, wenn ich das Wort Messing hörte, schlug mein Gewissen. Schliesslich merkte es mein Bruder.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0428 (1950-11-07, 05:00 - Freiburg)[in Giselas Stube.] Gespräche mit Gogarten über Verantwortung, Schuld, Verbrechen und Schuldlosigkeit: "Was man tut, indem man dem andern klar in die Augen sieht (vorausgesetzt, dies geschieht nicht im Krampf), ist eigentlich kein Verbrechen." Beispiel: Die Gegensätze: Berührung und Vergewaltigung; Mord und Kampf. Gogarten vertrat eine etwas andere Meinung, die mehr die Objektivität der Schuld sah, indem wir alles, was wir getan haben, auch selber sind. Er brauchte - in dem Traum - das Bild einer Schwebebahn: Wir sind die Pfeiler, sind die Rollen, über die alles hinwegrollt, sind zugleich aber auch alles, das, was jeweils über uns hinwegrollt, das wir tun, das geschieht. So wenigstens verstand ich sein Bild. Das Gespräch war noch sehr im Keime angelegt, bestand erst in wenigen Thesen, und Erwiderungen und musste noch ausgefochten werden, als ich erwachte. Das Bild der Schwebebahn war etwa so: Pfeiler. Querbalken mit Rollen, über die die Seile laufen, an welchen die Bahnen hängen. Eine psychologische Zwischenbemerkung, die Gogarten machte: "Sie haben mehr Ideen, ich habe weniger, aber Sie verknüpfen sie nicht genügend." Meine Erwiderung schon im Erwachen: "Das ist ganz natürlich, ich habe keine systematische Veranlagung. Man sieht es an der Schrift. Sie ist zerstückelt, wenig verknüpft".- Das ganze Gespräch hatte sich aus einer anderen Traumserie entwickelt, in der sich die Hauptfigur erst allmählich zur Gestalt Gogartens ausformte: Zuerst Kriegssituation. Überlegung, ob man vor den Russen fliehen solle. Gespräche wohl mit Krischan darüber - dann Übergang in Ausbildungs- und Garnisonssituation. Zuerst nachts. Schlafen im Stroh auf einer Scheunendiele. Vier, fünf Mann, die sich in zwei Parteien trennen, weil sie sich nicht vertragen können. Ich überlege, ob man eine Versöhnung versuchen solle. Eine Art Familiensituation, mit leisen in der Veranlagung begründeten Gegensätzen. Die Gestalt meiner Schwester spielt herein. Dann Heimkehr von der Übung in einen ständigen Standort. Dort bin ich Zeuge, wie der Feldwebel einem Mann Vorhaltungen macht, der nachts zu seinem Mädchen gegangen ist. Er habe nicht richtig, habe verbrecherisch gehandelt. Die Einzelheiten habe ich vergessen (wie immer die Quellpunkte des Traums am schnellsten verdeckt werden). Hieraus entspannt sich dann das Gespräch mit Gogarten, der darin übrigens nicht nur sich selbst sondern mehr die Geisteshaltung der Existenzphilosophie verkörperte. (356 words)

Gisela wandte sich gegen Heideggers Sprache. Ich sagte: "Man hat doch sehr viel, wenn man sich in sie hineinvertieft, von der Art, wie er alles zerlegt und in anderer Weise wieder zusammensetzt. Es ist eine ungeheure synthetische Leistung darin." Ein Student kuckte sich erstaunt nach uns um. (62 words)

"Fleckfieber" - hier eine Art Pest. Wahnsinnige Berührungsfurcht. Ich will entfliehen, doch sie halten mich fest. Sie halten mich für eine Art Heiler.

Eine Tür fällt vor ihm ins Schloss und er kommt nicht mit hinein. Ich bin wie erlöst, doch denke, dass der Hund vielleicht dort eingeklemmt sei. Ich sehe ihn in Gedanken - mit der Grausamkeit wie auf einem Bilde Wilhelm Busch's - dort hinter der Tür hängen. Der Gedanke an das Bild erheitert mich. Ich bin erstaunt und zugleich beglückt über diese meine Reaktion (Wohl schon im Erwachen). Dann gleich das Bewusstsein von der Bedeutung des Hundethemas. (126 words)

Sie arbeitet als eine kleine Verkäuferin in einer Drogerie. Dort begegne ich ihr, und sie geht hinter dem Ladentisch fort, um etwas für mich zu holen. Nach einer langen Weile kommt sie wieder und schenkt mir ein grösseres Paket. Der Ladenbesitzer ist misstrauisch, fragt nach und verlangt, das Paket zu öffnen. Bille sagt, die Sachen gingen auf ihre Kosten und gehörten teilweise ihr. Sie würde 2 Mark 70 dafür bezahlen müssen. Der Mann öffnet trotzdem das Paket indem er die Schnüre abstreift. Ich sage: "Es ist schade, was sie da tun, denn sie verderben durch dies Misstrauen den guten Ruf ihres Geschäftes. Sie verdächtigen sie, gelogen zu haben." Er antwortet: "Ja, das wissen wir vom ersten Moment an, dass sie das tut." Das Paket ist geöffnet. Anzüge kommen zum Vorschein, ein Mantel, eine Reithose. Bille sagt bei einigen Sachen: "Das ist von meinem Mann". Der Mantel und die Hose bleiben als Besitz des Geschäftes übrig. Darüber zeigen sich einige Konservendosen. "Das alles soll bloss 2 Mark 70 kosten?", sagt der Mann. Ich streichle Bille die Hand, die sehr verzweifelt ist. (192 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0443 (1950-11-29 - Freiburg)Die Kaiserin ist todkrank und liegt im Sterben. Ich komme zufällig mit Mutti in das Knesebecksche Haus, wo sie sich noch der Blumen annahm, wenn ihr Zustand sich zuweilen besserte. Zunächst bleibe ich im Hintergrund zurück, trete dann allmählich näher, bis an das Krankenbett. Während wir weniges sprechen, schaue ich der Kranken in die Augen, die fast zur Unkenntlichkeit verschleiert und gebrochen sind und sich immer wieder für kurze Augenblicke zu leuchtender Klarheit sammeln. Wir geben ihr Rotwein zu trinken, und während sich ihre Kräfte noch einmal sammeln, spürt sie ein Bedürfnis nach Bewegung, bei der ich innerlich mitgehe. Dabei verwandelt sich die Traumfigur teilweise in die Gestalt eines kleinen Mädchens, dessen rhythmische Bewegung an Gehversuche erinnert, die ich mit ihm ausführe. Schliesslich kommt mein Vater zu Pferde heim. Ich berichte ihm. Der Gestalt der Sterbenden ist jetzt als dritte Facette die Figur der Gattin und Mutter angeschliffen. Vater gibt ihr noch einmal etwas Rotwein zu trinken und beginnt dann einen Ausritt, bei dem ich ihn begleiten möchte. Die Kranke hat allmählich wieder ganz die Gestalt eines Kindes angenommen, doch ist dieser Gestaltwandel nicht im Traum von mir bemerkt, sondern nachträglich in der Besinnung konstatiert. Zuletzt wird das Mädchen, dessen Krankheits-Zustand nicht mehr so bedenklich scheint, gleichzeitig mit einem kleinen Jungen, der aber ganz gesund ist, zu Bett gebracht - in Etagenbetten, die mit einer Klappe geschlossen werden sie werden da gleichsam wie in einem Mechanismus hineingeschoben - wie in einen Backofen oder irgendeinem anderen - nicht gefährlichen - Apparat.

Ich hätte garzugerne einen mitgenommen. Dann von einem Kind, das eine Brezel und einen Gummiball gestohlen hatte. Die Brezel zertrat es, das derbere, den Gummiball hat es mit nach Hause genommen, weil er so leidenschaftlich sprang. Dann von Iwand, der seine Vorlesung so oft ausfallen liess, dass ein Anderer sie weiter führte, doch nahm Iwand sie wieder auf und jeder spann sie dann auf seine Weise weiter. Nur dass Iwand dauernd die Zeiten und Texte wechselte, ärgerte mich. - Zuallererst vom Eisenbahnfahren. Die Erinnerungsperspektive ist umgekehrt zur wirklichen Reihenfolge der Träume.

Ich versuche, ihn nicht mehr aus meinem Blick zu entlassen und ziehe mich langsam durch die Tür zurück, nachdem die Kinder fort sind. Dann schliesse ich schnell die Tür zu, laufe über den Flur in das Kinderzimmer, das Glastüren zu den anderen Räumen hat, durch welche ich den Hund nun laufen sehe, und verschliesse auch diesen Zugang. Der Hund hat nun noch eine Zimmerflucht von drei Zimmern zur Verfügung, doch kann er in das Kinderzimmer nicht hinein. - Zweite Szene: Beim Essen in diesem Raum Gespräche über Psychoanalyse. Über die Quellen meines Wissens befragt, gebe ich unter anderem auch die Autoanalyse an. Bedenkliche Gesichter. - Dritte Szene: Gefangenschaft. Transport in einer Art Strassenbahn. Hier setzt sich die Gesprächsszene fort. Ein Russe aus dem Mannschaftsdienstgrade beginnt, im Spiel mich zu untersuchen. Als er aber mit dem Finger mir in den Hals fährt, um den Kehlkopf zu prüfen, halte ich seine Hand fest, weil er kein Arzt ist und ich ihn für ungeschickt halte. Er wird sehr böse. Wir geraten in eine Debatte, bei der wir beide die Hilfe eines anwesenden Leutnants (russischen) anrufen. Der findet die Sache sehr komisch und erzählt, dass schon einer seiner Gefangenen, namens Ferber, sich in ebensolcher Situation ebenso verhalten habe. Während des Gesprächs führen mir die Soldaten in den Arm eine Spritze ein, offenbar zur Beruhigung, was sie wohl für nötig halten. Ich tue so, als ob ich es nicht merke, und mache Autogenes Training, um nicht mit dem Arm zu zucken. (263 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0452 (1950-12-06 - Freiburg)Vater auf dem Krankenbett, kurz vor seinem Tode. Kühnel als Arzt. Onkel Adolf. Emmi. Etwas gespannte Situation, weil Vater infolge seiner Arteriosklerose viele merkwürdige Wünsche hat, die Emmi nicht verstehen kann. Kühnel macht Vorschläge. In einem elektrischen Kocher werden irgendwelche Flüssigkeiten gekocht, eine Mischung aus Wasser, Milch und Brotbrocken - oder ähnlich - in drei schmalen Gefässen, wie Trinkgläser, die nebeneinander im Kocher stehen. Sie kochen dann über und das Übergekochte schwimmt im Kocher herum. Onkel Adolf berührt es unangenehm, dass während meines Gesprächs mit Kühnel das Radio spielt, während doch Vater so kurz vor dem Tode ist. Mir ist das alles egal, ich halte es für nebensächlich, formal. Kühnel spricht mit mir über die Möglichkeit einer Rente aus dem Waisenhaus. Dann kommt Emmi sehr verweint herein, so dass ich denke, Vater sei gestorben. Es hat aber einen anderen Grund. Dann habe ich den Traum aus der Erinnerung verloren. Gisela kam noch vor. (153 words)

Dann soll ich allein mit einem Boot fahren. Ich fürchte, ich werde die Orientierung verlieren, weil ich keinen Kompass habe.- Dann in einem Raum der Universität, in dem gleich ein Kolloquium stattfinden soll, zu dem ich mich aber nicht gemeldet habe. Man sagt mir, wenn ich noch rausgehen wolle, müsse ich mich beeilen, da das Kolloquium gleich beginne. Die Antipoden des Gespräches sind ein genialischer Typ mit langen Haaren (wie Rheindell) und ein gewissenhafter (wie Wittram). Irgendein mir bekannter Professor kommt in den Raum, doch weiss nicht, ob er eigentlich zu dem Kolloquium gehört oder nicht. Er hat es vergessen. Man nimmt ihn freundlich auf und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass man ja auch improvisieren könne. Nächste Szene: Ich gehe mit der kleinen Sibylla nach Hause. Der kürzeste Weg geht durch schmale Gassen, die auf dem Münsterplatz münden. Dazwischen muss man einmal quer durchs Münster gehen. Wir irren beim Überqueren des Platzes aber seitlich ab. Sibylla sieht die Reklame einer Zeitung 4711 und strebt ohne jede Rücksicht auf den Strassenverkehr starr und steif auf sie zu. Ich kann sie kaum davon abhalten, geradewegs in das nächste Auto zu rennen, muss sie schliesslich schlagen, und es gibt Tränen. Als wir endlich den Bürgersteig erreicht haben, fragt eine Frau, was denn der Kummer wäre. Sibylla jammert nach der Zeitung 4711. Die Frau befriedigt den Wunsch und meint: Du hast doch einen Mann bei dir, der könnte doch für dich die Zeitung holen. (263 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0468 (1950-12-27 - München)Gespräche mit Jünger über Hitler und mit Franz über Gisela. Es ist erstaunlich, wie man im Traum Möglichkeiten durchprobiert, auf die man im Wachen nie verfallen wird. So vertrat Jünger hier eine andere und viel freiere und positivere Ansicht über Hitler als die zeitübliche. Das Gespräch wurde in grosser Gelassenheit geführt und durch lange Blickpausen unterbrochen. Das Gespräch mit Franz entwickelte sich aus einigen Bemerkungen über einen Mann, der sich von seiner Frau scheiden lassen wollte ohne Angabe des Grundes, nur weil er ihrer überdrüssig sei. Ich vertrat die These, dass dann eine andere Frau dahinter stehen müsse, und entwickelte die Theorie der Übertragung, über die ich länger sprach, wobei ich mich in mich selbst abkapselte und in die Anschauung dieser Zusammenhänge vertiefte. Franz, der aufmerksam zugehört hatte, erwiderte, das sei alles wie eine Theorie von oben her und die Tatsachen schienen ihm anders zu sprechen. Ich war erstaunt, wie wenig er diese Zusammenhänge sehen konnte, war aber doch durch das Gespräch in einen solchen Kontakt mit ihm gekommen, dass wir nun von selbst auf Gisela zu sprechen kamen. Er sprach von dem Acht-Tage-Termin, einem Begriff aus dem Hundertjährigen Kalender, den ich nicht kannte. Er meinte damit, dass in einer Periodizität von ungefähr acht Tagen eine stärkere Annäherung zwischen mir und Gisela stattfände, wie er sie sehr wohl gemerkt habe. Während unseres Gespräches wurde es dunkler, und ich versank in eine Art hypnotischen Zustand, in dem ich einen körperlichen Kontakt zu Franz bekam, über den ich mich selbst sehr wunderte, da ich daneben immer noch die leibliche Abneigung äussersten Hasses verspürte. Doch kam auch er mir darin entgegen und so kam es, dass ich, schon halb im Schlaf, die Haut seines Armes mit leisem Küssen berührte. In der nächsten Szene ging ich in ein grosses burgartiges Haus, in welchem Schwestern pflegten und in dem Gisela im Bett lag, und erwachte bei dem Unternehmen, Franz durchs Fenster zu rufen, nachdem ich festgestellt hatte, dass Gisela nicht schlief. Ich überlegte schon im Erwachen, dass ich dazu das Beethoven Konzert pfeifen wollte, und glitt dann in die Reflexion über, dass in diesem Thema, das Franz stets vor Giselas Fenster gepfiffen hat, sich äusserster Hass mit äusserster Liebe in mir berühren.

Verschiedenheiten der gesamten Weltauffassung schimmern bei der verschiedenen Behandlungsart der Dinge durch, Unterschiede moralischer und ästhetischer Behandlung. Reinigung und Polituren. Dann werde ich von einem Schäferhunde angefallen. Ich erkenne das sofort als Traumbild, mache zunächst Autogenes Training, um die Angst zu dämpfen, und beschliesse dann, den Hund so lange mit dem Kopf gegen eine Mauer zu schlagen, bis das Traumbild zerstört ist. Doch gelingt mir nicht sogleich das Erwachen, und mich erschreckt die Brutalität meines Vorgehens, da aller Schein der Wirklichkeit gegen mich spricht. Ich habe gegenüber den Strassenpassanten das geheimnisvolle Gefühl eines Mannes, der die Wirklichkeit anbohrt, um dahinter auf die eigentliche Realität zu stossen, bei alledem habe ich das Maul des Hundes fest geschlossen und werfe das ganze Gewicht meines Körpers hinter jedem Rammstoss an die Mauer bis zum Erwachen.

Davor Durchfahrt durch einsturzgefährliche Gebäude (ähnlich den Propyläen am Königlichen Platz) in denen die Strassenbahn schliesslich stecken bleibt. Ich steige aus und gehe zu Fuss.

Eigentlich war es eine Fahrt von einem Hause Heideggers zu einem anderen, denn das zweite sollte vom Wohnungsamt beschlagnahmt werden, obwohl er dort seine Vorträge halten wollte. (106 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0489 (1951-01-23 - Freiburg)Am Morgen Träume vom Funk, vom Autofahren und von der Ecole Dancer. Ich schaute zu und gehörte sehr bald selbst zu den Tänzern. Während des Zuschauens las ich in einer Mappe mit Gedichtentwürfen Giselas. Zuletzt sprang ich eine Treppe hoch in mein Zimmer. Die letzten Stufen legte ich nackt zurück. Räumlichkeit und Atmosphäre dieses Traums enthielten ausser der Tanzschule die Musikhochschule und die Kunstakademie. Die vorkommenden Personen stammen teilweise aus der Wittmoldter Umgebung. Auch ein Schuss aus dem Geist der roten Schuhe war dem Ganzen untermischt. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0492 (1951-01-27 - Freiburg)Ich kam aus Wittmoldt und war nur mit einem ganz leichten Hemd bekleidet, das aber ungeschickt geschnitten war. Auf meinem Spaziergang nun versuchte ich, von hinten an den Hof heranzukommen. Ich trat durch ein grosses Tor in einen Park ein und ging meinem Gefühl nach in der Richtung dem Hof zu. Doch musste ich über eine kleine Landbrücke zwischen zwei Teichen, auf der ein Kettenhund schlief. Ich versuchte, mich ganz am Rande entlangzudrücken, doch der Hund erwachte. Es war mein Glück, dass er in seine Kette noch verwickelt war, die sich mehrfach um den Bauch geschlungen hatte. Ich strebte auf dem kürzesten Weg aus der Gefahrenzone fort und spürte sehr bald den Hund mir auf den Fersen, dessen Kette endlos zu sein schien. Schliesslich sah ich mich ins Wasser gedrängt, in das ich mit einem leisen Ekel hinein trat, weil es von Landgewächsen und Grünem erfüllt war. Ich bewegte meine Füsse in einer halb gehenden, halb schwimmenden Bewegung, während ich den Hund dicht hinter mir an seiner Kette schwimmen sah und hörte. Kurz bevor ich an das Land trat und erwachte, merkte ich, dass seine Kette aufgebraucht war, und er begann zu bellen. (193 words)

Etwa eine halbe Stunde später, als es höchste Zeit zum Aufstehen und Gehen wurde, träumte ich, ich ginge eine Treppe hoch, um Gisela zu wecken. Ich trat in ihr noch halbdunkles Zimmer ein, in dem eine warme und unendlich wohlige Atmosphäre herrschte. Sie drehte sich auf die andere Seite und reckte sich im Schlaf, so das ein Fuss unter der Bettdecke herausfuhr. Erwachen. (85 words)

Alle diese Ordnungen blitzen nur auf an einem kleinen Genrebild, wo ein kleiner Junge und ein kleines Mädchen eine Kellertreppe runtersteigen, um ein Spiel zu holen. Das Ganze ist zwar in die Ebneter Familie projiziert, spielt aber offensichtlich eine Generation früher, wo es wirklich die vielen Jungen und ein Mädchen gab. Der Traum gleichzeitig eine Art Erzählung von Elisabeth Baumgarten. (96 words)

Ich sagte: vielleicht, ich wisse es nicht, es könne auch sein, dass ich ähnliche Bilder nur in einer Illustrierten gesehen habe. Die beschäftigten mich dann so sehr, als ob ich einen Film gesehen habe. Er: Was für eine schöne Gabe! -- Ich: Ja, ich bin etwas eidetisch veranlagt. -- Ich beschloss, solche Bilder zu sammeln, um später Filmaufnahmen nach ihnen zu machen.

Die ländliche Orientierung hat etwas ganz anderes an sich als die städtische.

Er sprach in Symbolen, indem er Gläser auf den Tisch stellte, einen Römer, um den er runde und bäuerlich hölzerne Symbole gruppierte -- "dies alles muss den andeuten -- diesen Lebensweg", sagte er -- und dann ein ohne Bauchung geöffnetes Glas, das wohl den wenig erdigen, den Menschen von geringerem Format darstellte. Während wir noch sprachen, wobei ich vor einer kleinen Kiste, auf der alles aufgebaut war, kniete, kam ein alter Mann herein mit einer Blume, die wie ein abgeblautes Veilchen war, zugleich nur eine geöffnete unter vielen Knospen, die in einer Traube wie eine Taubnessel angeordnet waren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0566 (1951-05-20 - Freiburg)Angsttraum. Erwachen mit starkem Herzklopfen. Dadurch erschwerte Besinnung. Nachts vier Uhr. -- Ich bin in einer neu ausgebauten, im Ausbau befindlichen Art Felsenwohnung, eher wie ein Schloss oder Palast, wo in einem Raum in die natürliche Spalte eines Felsens Strom- und Gasleitung verlegt werden. Die Elektriker haben bereits sich mit der Stromleitung befasst. Plessner ist für die Verlegung der Gasleitung zuständig. Einer der Arbeiter hat bereits als Vorarbeit einen Schlauch durch die sehr gewundene Spalte gezwängt. Die Elektriker im Nachbarraum hört man laut schimpfen: Er hätte damit den Stein und ihre Arbeit gefährdet. Ich öffne die Türe und mahne sie zur Ruhe. Der Mann sei zwar nicht da -- aber wäre er da gewesen, würde er das alles gehört haben. Während dem sieht man durchs Fenster draussen Plessner auf- und ab gehen mit Regenmantel und Hut. Er steht vor einem Gedenkstein und liest die eingehauene Schrift, in dem er mit dem Finger darin langfährt. Ich denke: Ein hoch-taktiler Mensch, der ein ursprüngliches Verhältnis zum Stofflichen hat. Sonst hätte man ihm auch nicht die Aufgabe übertragen, die Gasleitung durch die Spalte des Felsblockes zu legen, die das wichtigste Stück der Wohnung zu sein scheint. Eine Art Heiligtum. Ich frage die anderen, ob ihnen diese taktile Eigenart Plessners aufgefallen sei. Sie haben sie zwar gesehen, aber nicht in ihrer Bedeutsamkeit verstanden. -- Nächste Szene im Nachbarzimmer, also wieder dem Raum, in dem die Leitungen gelegt sind. Eine Frau, die vom Wohnungsamt in einen dritten angrenzenden Raum eingewiesen ist. Mit Pelzkragen und spiessigem Hut. Ich denke: Die wird nun eingewiesen und weiss sicher gar nicht, in was für einem Heiligtum sie wohnt. Dann ist auch Emmi dort. Ich will Licht machen, damit die Frau was sehen kann. Die Sicherung ist kaputt. Ich bringe sie in Ordnung. Emmi kommt an einen Draht und kann nicht wieder los. Der Strom hält sie fest, die Frau will ihr helfen, bleibt ebenfalls hängen. Emmi schreit. Ich will die Schnur losreissen. Es gelingt nicht. Ich laufe umher, schaue ins Nachbarzimmer, um Vater zu suchen, und schreie: "Haupthahn ausschalten, Haupthahn ausschalten..." -- allmähliches Erwachen mit starken Herzklopfen und grosser Angst. Erschwerte Besinnung auf das Inhaltliche des Traums. (358 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0581 (1951-06-07, 07:00 - Freiburg)Angsttraum beim Erwachen während des Heulens einer Sirene. Orphées Tod musste selber sterben. Vom Auto überfahren. Die Leiche dargestellt durch einen Draht und eine elektrische Birne. Die Birne wirkt übrigens wie ein embryonaler Kopf eines zu früh geborenen Kaninchens, das ich einmal mit Schauder beseitigte und später wieder suchte, mit der Furcht, es könne noch leben. Orphées Tod als Leiche. Nur ein Draht und diese gläserne Birne -- und das war so erschütternd ähnlich. Die Frau, die in meiner Begleitung war, schrie sofort: "Ein Leichentuch. " Ich umfasste sie von hinten (um sie selber zugleich zu halten) und schloss die Augen und vergrub mich in ihrem Gewand, bis das Tuch in Eile gerafft und über die Leiche geworfen war. Das Ganze war in seiner surrealistischen Darstellung zugleich die Handlung eines Films. -- Folgende Vorgeschichte mit dauernden Changieren der Personen: Eine Hungersnot im Lande. Ein Mann musste sterben, weil er Sägespäne gegessen hatte. Ich höre gerade die Geschichte von ihm selbst erzählt. In dem Moment sehe ich andere -- Professoren der Musikhochschule und Studenten -- heimlich in ein Nebenzimmer gehen und in die Handtücher beissen, die dort hängen. Ich halte alle davon zurück, indem ich sie fortreisse, die in wollige Handtücher gebissen haben. -- Nur die, die in leinene gebissen haben, lasse ich daran hängen (wie ein Kind an den Brüsten der Mutter) -- vielleicht müssen auch sie sterben. Aber es ist möglich, dass sie am Leben bleiben. Einer der Männer, die ich fortgerissen habe, beisst stattdessen in meinen Anzug und durch den Stoff hindurch in meinen Leib (Bauch). Aber da er nur wenig Fleisch zu fassen bekommt, lasse ich ihn. Folgende Szene sehe ich wieder wie als Film: Ein Mädchen wird von einem Amerikaner in einem schönem Auto fortgenommen in die Welt, wo es zu essen gibt. Sie verspricht ihrem Geliebten, ihm alles Brot zuzuwerfen, das es ihm Wagen gibt. Ich sitze nun selbst an der Stelle des Mädchens, sehe sie aber dennoch zugleich zeitweilig ihre Rolle spielen. Der Amerikaner hat ihr keine Brotlaibe gegeben, nur gestrichenes Brot. Ich höre ihn sagen: "Du siehst, dass wir keinen Hunger haben: wenn man massenweise Quark aufs Brot klackt und doch selbst nichts isst." Ich denke, das Mädchen habe alles gegessen -- aber ich fühle -- jetzt wieder ihre Rolle spielend und an ihrem Platz im Wagen sitzend -- die in Pergamentpapier gewickelten Brote unter mir, halb seitlich -- sie versteckend auf ihnen sitzend. -- Ich will sie nun dem Geliebten, der jetzt -- als mein Partner -- eine Frau ist, zustecken. Sie steht ganz dicht am Wagen. Der Amerikaner scheint sich nicht umzukucken. Dann ist plötzlich der Amerikaner am Steuer fort. Ich sehe die Szene wieder als Film: Eine Frau -- der Tod Orphées, die gleichzeitig, da ich als Mann das Mädchen war, selbst als Frau die Rolle des Steuernden hat, sitzt nicht mehr im Wagen (wo jetzt schon wieder statt meiner das Mädchen, das ich zu spielen hatte, ratlos selber lenkend am Steuer des fremden Wagens sitzt). Der Tod Orphées jedoch, zugleich der eigentliche Steuermann des Wagens, liegt überfahren auf der Strasse -- inmitten eines Menschengewühls -- dargestellt nur durch einen Draht und eine dazugehörige gläserne Birne als Kopf, doch von so erschütternder Realistik, dass das Mädchen aus dem Wagen, die inzwischen wie eine Frau geworden ist, mich festhält und laut ruft: "Ein Leichentuch! " Das Tuch (ein weisses Laken) wird in Eile gerafft und über die Leiche geworfen. Ich schliesse die Augen, grabe meinen Kopf in ihrem Rücken in das Kleid der Frau und umklammere sie zugleich selbst, um sie vor dem Fallen zu bewahren. (595 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0588 (1951-06-18 - Freiburg)Traum von einem Mädchen, die mich in gebrochenem Deutsch ansprach. Sie war sehr schmal, trug einen Rock von gelblichem Leinen und eine Uniformjacke, darunter eine weisse Leinenbluse, die am Ausschnitt mit kleinen weissen Bändern leicht zugeschnürt war. Ich trug ein ähnliches Hemd, an dem sie mir die Bänder aufzog. Sie wollte einen "Bringe-Koffer" von mir geliehen haben. Ich zog sie heran, um sie zunächst zu erforschen. Specht stand abwartend im Hintergrund und antwortete nur mit "Sie müssen selber wissen", das in seinen Augen lag, auf meine fragenden Blicke. Ihre Sachen machten einen geordneten Eindruck und ihre Antworten zeugten von einer hohen Bildung. Verwundern tat mich die alte feldgraue Uniformjacke, die noch alle Dienstabzeichen trug. Später kam mir das Mädchen aus den Augen, das mich übrigens vor einem psychologischen Seminar angesprochen hatte, und ich machte mich auf, sie zu suchen. Auch jetzt noch beschäftigt mich die Gestalt. Andere Mädchen sah man in durchsichtigen Kleidern. (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0589 (1951-06-20 - Freiburg)Heidegger wählt einen Kreis von Schülern, die dafür sorgen sollen, dass nur echtes Brot von ihm als "Heideggers Brot" in den Handel kommt. Darunter auch Specht und mich. Das Brot ist blütenweisses Weissbrot in einem runden Laib und sehr festes Vollkornbrot in ebensolchem Laib. Dann wird Kuchen verteilt. Ich möchte aber lieber von dem Brot. Dann von einem Film von Cocteau. Jetzt werden numerierte Exemplare des Buches, über das der Film gedreht ist, für eine Mark verkauft. Ich bekomme das letzte Exemplar. In dieses stehen einige Namen eingeschrieben, die das Buch vor mir besassen. Hier ist überhaupt der Szenenwechsel und der zuerst erzählte Traum kommt erst hier: Unter den Namen finde ich auch Spechts und meinen. Das ist dann die Karte, wo Heidegger die Namen der Brotbewahrer aufgeschrieben hat. Das Eine-Mark-Stück ist nun zu einer Drachme geworden, über die und deren Echtheit in dem Seminar gesprochen wird. Ich sehe mich in einer Szene die Drachme erhalten und in mein Portemonnaie stecken in einer Zeit, da sie noch gültig ist, also im alten Rom. Sodann schaue ich -- heute -- in mein Portemonnaie und sehe darin die Drachme. Ich schliesse daraus, dass ich sehr bewahrend gewesen bin und die Drachme vom alten Rom bis heute in ihrer Echtheit bewahrt habe. Ich bin glücklich darüber und erzähle es Heidegger während des Seminars. In der Erzählung aber durchschaue ich den Trugschluss und füge das hinzu: Die römische Szene muss Traum gewesen sein, sonst müsste man ja annehmen, dass ich zweitausend Jahre alt sei. Ich höre jemanden während des Seminars laut Flöte spielen. Ich nehme an, dass es der Bildhauer und Weinbauernsohn Graffe im Hintergrund ist. Graffe sitzt aber zugleich neben mir. Solche Doppelheit ist schon vorher in dem Traum einmal vorgekommen: Als ich in das Kino ging, sagte ich zu Gisela, die mich begleitete: "Beleg schon einmal einen Platz für mich mit, ich will noch mal raus gehen und sehen, ob Gisela da ist, obwohl ich nicht glaube, dass sie kommt, da sie in den letzten Tagen nicht mehr gekommen ist." -- Dann spricht Heidegger über Handschrift. Er malt eine Handschrift an die Tafel, und meint, dass man die Schrift stärker nicht vereinfachen könne. Ich erwidere, dass es sehr zerlöste Schriften gebe, die in ihrer Vereinfachung zugleich oft sehr schön seien. Er malt ein Beispiel an die Tafel: G r a f f. Ich sage: "Nein, nicht so. Hier sind ja nur die Buchstaben isoliert gesetzt. Ich will vielleicht selbst schnell ein Beispiel anschreiben." Man lacht. Ich erwache, während ich an die Tafel gehe und ein Bild des Wortes entwerfe, das ich anschreiben will: (Hier sind die Buchstaben G r a f f e sehr vereinfacht geschrieben). (444 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0590 (1951-06-17 - Freiburg)Erst vom Essen. Dann Aufstieg auf einer Treppe, zusammen mit Karl Marx. Ich sage: "Ihr Name kommt mir bekannt vor". " Er: "Sie denken an den Marxisten. " Ich: "Nicht so sehr. Zunächst an den Maler, an den Bildhauer und andere. " -- "Sie wohnen hier?" Er: "Ja, auf dem Boden habe ich ein Zimmer. Dort lese ich und schreibe ich." Ich: "Werden Sie sehr überwacht? " Er: "Nein, nicht besonders." (Es ist während der Nazizeit.) Ich steige während des Gesprächs höher mit ihm die Treppe hinauf, als ich eigentlich gewollt hatte. Plötzlich steht ein Hund im Weg, an einer Leine, die aber so befestigt ist, dass er sie samt ihrem Befestigungspunkt mit sich ziehen kann. Karl Marx geht vorbei. Ich weiche zurück. Die Treppe hinab. Der Hund folgt mir. Angst. Dann aber plötzlich hält er inne, weil auf einmal am anderen Ende der Leine ein Hase angebunden ist, so dass sich beide die Waage halten. Ich werde erheitert der Traumsymbolik inne und erwache langsam. Vorher andere Träume: Ich soll für meine Schwester telephonieren. Die Verbindung kommt immer nicht zustande (Ferngespräch nach Kiel).

Ich sah zum Beispiel eine Drehscheibe, als ich aber gemerkt hatte, dass es wieder nur eidetisch war, und die Augen öffnete, sah ich, dass die Leisten aus dem Gestänge über meinem Bett das Bild erzeugt hatten. Diese war jedoch da immer noch anders als in Wirklichkeit. Die Grenzen zwischen Traum und Aufwachen sind hier kaum anzugeben, weil der Traum selbst durch das Thema Eidetik sich verschleierte. Auch sah ich einmal ein Blatt, auf dem ich versucht hatte, einen Traum aufzuschreiben, ohne dass es gelungen war. Die Worte waren sinnlos verteilt und zum Teil sinnlos wiederholt, senkrecht untereinander lauter Wiederholungen. Dann wachte ich aber erst richtig auf, und nun war auch das Blatt fort. Erst jetzt komme ich zu dem Schluss -- das natürlich alles nur Traum war -- also erst etwa fünf Minuten nach dem Erwachen. (167 words)

Wie ein roter Faden geht durch diese Träume das Bedürfnis, zunächst von der Hitze und Schwüle sich abzudecken und das Kopfkissen immerwährend zu verschieben, und zuletzt gegen Morgen in der Kühle sich langsam zu bedecken. Dies in der Form, dass die vorher zerlegten Handschriften langsam wieder deutlich wurden und sich in ihren Formen zeigten. Alles Inhaltliche habe ich vergessen, doch ist es, als hätte ich einen grossen Haufen der Stilgerüste abgegessener Weintrauben vor mir, die ich in der Nacht verspeiste.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0616 (1951-07-12 - Freiburg)Traum von Frau M. . Sie hatte sich mit meinem Bruder und mir befreundet. Sie glaubte, von uns lernen zu können. Das Verhältnis war sehr innig, doch nicht leidenschaftlich. Sie sagte mir, man hielte sich deswegen für verrückt, da man dächte, dass sie alle meine Sonderheiten nun auch annehmen würde wie Aktstehen in der Akademie, sich paradiesisch sonnen auf dem Dach, eine rote Badehose haben, in Sandalen spazieren gehen. Sie schrieb eine Bilderschrift, in der sie mir dies aufzeichnete. Sie sagte: Das ist die Schrift der Graphologen. Aus einem ungeheuer gleitenden, nur von dem Bild geführten und durch keine Form schematisierten Bewegungsfluss sprangen die Bilder hervor, leuchteten die Glieder auf, die sie auf das Papier zeichnete. Am schönsten war das Aktbild, das sie an den Oberschenkeln begann. Sie formte die Konturen in der Tat im Fluss wie die Züge eines Buchstabens und nicht in zeichnender, sondern schreibender Bewegung. - (Anderer Traum:) Gespräch mit Baumgarten über Binding auf dem Heimweg aus der Universität -- besonders über die Geschichte von dem Ritter, dem Tod und St. Georg. ("St. Georgs Stellvertreter"). (178 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0617 (1951-07-14 - Freiburg)Vielfältige Träume. Vorherrschen der blauen Farbe. Anklänge an einen schlechten Film, den ich gestern sah, der hier um vieles gebessert war. Indessen wäre auch eine Traumdeutung möglich, die das Sein des Traums nicht von hierher auslegen, sondern von dem ausgehen würde, was sich im Traum uns zeigt -- Tiere und Gestalten, die darin ihr Leben haben. Beide Ansichten sind wahrscheinlich richtig. Auch wird man hier den Schichtungsgedanken anwenden dürfen. Man könnte - analog zur Deutung der Handschrift -von einem Triebbild des Traumes treffen (wie vom Bewegungsbild der Schrift), dem die Entschlüsselung nachspüren würde -- dann von einem Formbild, das uns in der Art und in dem Niveau seiner Verschlüsselung interessieren würde -- und endlich von der Welt des Traumes im Ganzen, von der Art, wie wir darin in unser Leben eingelassen sind: seinen Raum: und Zeitbild. Dies würde die eigentlich geschichtliche Seite des Traumes ausmachen. Der Ort der Handlung, ihre Zeit, die Fülle der Zeiten, der Wechsel der Szene, die Verdichtung der Personen würden hierher gehören. So hätten wir Bewegung, Stil und Räumlichkeit des Traums. Endlich ist wichtig noch die Sicht auf Möglichkeiten, sein Abtasten der Zukunft, sein Tendieren auf ein Telos. Auch das Hyletische im Traum ist wichtig. Die Stofflichkeit, die in ihm vorherrscht und gesucht wird, endlich der Einschlag unserer körperlichen Masse, den die Auslegung in ihrer Messung zu Grunde zu legen hat. -- So gibt es sehr viele Gesichtspunkte für die Auslegung des Traums.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0618 (1951-07-15 - Freiburg)Traum heute nacht: Ich fuhr mit Specht in der Eisenbahn und musste an einer Station Köln-Sülz umsteigen. Ich sah hinter dem Bahnsteig die Gewässer und jenseits als schmalen Streifen das bewaldete Ufer. Jedoch dachte ich, dass erst die nächste Station der Ort meines Umsteigens. Als der Zug anfuhr, kam es heraus, dass wir bereits Köln-Sülz verlassen hatten. Mich bestürzte der Gedanke, das ganze nun kommende Stück zurückfahren zu müssen, denn der D-Zug, in dem wir sassen, würde nun bis zur nächsten Grossstadt viele Stunden durchfahren. Ehe ich mich entschliessen konnte, abzuspringen und mein Gepäck hinauszuwerfen, hatte der Zug eine solche Geschwindigkeit erreicht, das dies nicht mehr möglich war. Kurz hinter der Station jedoch bremste er noch einmal, ich sprang heraus, Specht warf mir meine Koffer nach und stieg, schon im Anrollen des Zuges, noch selbst hinaus, um ein schwereres Stück hinabzusetzen. Dabei fuhr auch ihm der Zug davon. (148 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0619 (1951-07-15 - Freiburg)Ich trug irgendetwas in der Tasche, was durch seinen Geruch die Hunde anziehen musste. Ein kleiner Windhund, der mir begegnete, kehrte denn auch sofort um, als er den Geruch witterte, und versuchte, mir spielend in die Hände zu beissen. Ich dachte, ihn fortzuscheuchen, indem ich mit der Tasche wedelte. Über dem kam noch ein anderes Tier hinzu. Ich sagte: Ach, nun kommt auch noch eine Gans. - "Ich bin doch keine Gans, ich bin doch eine Ente", antwortete es. Ich versuchte nun, die Tiere abzustreifen, indem ich in einen Korridor entwich, von welchem rechts eine Tür zum Badezimmer führte. Am Eingang zum Korridor war an der Wand ein Turm von leeren Streichholzschachtelfächern aufgerichtet, halb zum Spiel, die bei meinem Durchgang umfielen. Ich versuchte, sie wieder aufzurichten. Es gelang mir jedoch nicht. Die obersten Stücke warfen jeweils den Turm um. Die Situation verdichtete sich: Es war vor Weihnachten. Das Bauen des Turmes nahm Geschenkcharakter an. Mein Bruder und mein Vater, der im Badezimmer aus der Wanne gestiegen war, halfen mir. Wir hatten eine Idee: Man müsste die Schachteln stärken. Dann würden sie in sich fest sein und aneinander und an der ölfarbigen Wand haften. Mein Vater holte also aus seiner Kragenschachtel ein wenig Stärkepulver, wir schütteten es in sein Badewasser, das sich damit rotbräunlich färbte und warfen alle Streichholzschachteln hinein. Dann baute ich den Turm, während mein Bruder mir die Schachteln aus dem Wasser zuwarf. Der Bau unterlag nun jedoch einer neuen Störung, denn mein Vater hatte Bücher und Hefte mit in den Turm gefügt, die aus irgend einem Grunde ebenfalls ins Wasser geraten waren. Ich musste also den Turm einreissen und von vorne beginnen. Um der grösseren Festigkeit willen baute ich diesmal zwei Reihen nebeneinander hoch. Doch reichten die Schachteln jetzt nicht mehr die Wand hinauf, sondern nur bis zu einem Bord, das vorher nicht da gewesen war. So blieb der Trum ein Torso, als ich erwachte und ihn wie visionär unter dem Weihnachtsbaum sah. (325 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0620 (1951-07-16 - Freiburg)Traum von einer Verzauberung, in der ich schweben konnte über Gängen und Treppen durch märchenhafte Feste und endlich (hungrig), wieder zurückkam in die kellerhafte Zellen, in denen ich als Soldat lebte. Doch erlebte ich dies alles zugleich wie ein Märchen, in dessen Hauptfigur nur von ferne mein eigenes Ich einfloss. Die Rückkehr war schwierig, da ich das lange Fehlen im Dienst motivieren musste. Auch konnte ich die Zelle nicht wiederfinden, da ich sie mit Aborten verwechselte. -- Davor ein anderer Traum, in dem ich mit halbzahmen Antilopen spielte. Als sie mich jedoch beissen wollten, lockte ich sie in ihre Ställe zurück. Sie drohte -- die eine -- jedoch, mich über die halbhohe Barriere wieder anzuspringen, weil sie unzufrieden war, dass ihr das angespannte Gummiseil fehlte, auf dem sie sonst mit aufgestützten Vorderpfoten auf- und niederhüpfte und sich so austobte. Ich lief sofort zu Emmi, die für den Stall verantwortlich war, und teilte ihr das Unheil mit. (156 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0621 (1951-07-19 - Freiburg)Schiffahrt über den Ozean. Mit zwei Amerikanern in eine Kabine, in der nur langweilige Leute waren. Wir siedelten darum in eine Kabine über, die die Amerikaner ausfindig gemacht hatten, weil in ihr nur zwei Mädchen wohnten. Wir sahen zunächst die Betten und zwei Sofas, später die Mädchen selber. Szenenwechsel: Nacht. Ich war neben dem Bett, in dem das eine Mädchen, eine Türkin, lag, mit sehr braunem Gesicht, die einen strengen Eindruck machte. Das andere Mädchen, eine Asiatin, mit blendend weissen Zähnen, die sich zu ihrem hellen Haar eine dunkle Locke ins Gesicht gemacht hatte, legte sich neben mich, und versuchte, mich zu sich zu ziehen. Sie war im ganzen derber als die Türkin, aber von stärkerer Vitalität. Ich fühlte mich zwischen beiden hin- und hergerissen, glitt aber schliesslich zu der Asiatin, da die Türkin mir zu unbeweglich schien. Dann verlief sich die Szene. -- Nächste Szene: Ich suchte -- mit Emmis Assistenz -- meine Decken in dem Schiff und fand sie alle bis auf eine gestreifte, die der Baumgärtnerin gehörte (das ist diejenige, mit der ich immer in der Sonne auf dem Dach liege. Paradiesisch. Dabei hat sie sehr gelitten und ich möchte nicht, dass die Baumgärtnerin sie sieht, ehe Emmi sie geflickt hat). Das Schiff glich bei diesem Suchen einer Bühne, auf der man nach dem Schauspiel seine Utensilien zusammensucht. Schliesslich fand ich eine gestreifte Decke. Es war aber nicht die richtige. Da leuchtete mir ein, dass die richtige auf dem anderen Schiff sein müsse, das längst in eine andere Himmelsrichtung gefahren war. Der Kabinenwechsel war also inzwischen zum Schiffswechsel (in der Traumerinnerung) geworden. Ich schwankte nun, ob ich die gefundene Decke nehmen solle, da die andere mir ja unzugänglich war. Als ich mich aufrichtete, bemerkte ich im Spiegel meine Tätowierung, die ich mir auf dem Schiff hatte machen lassen: Meine Wappenfarben schwarz-silber-rot, in breiten Streifen um die Schultern gelegt, so wie das blonde asiatische Mädchen, die sich zu mir gelegt hatte, ein breit um die Schultern gestreiftes Gewand hatte, das einer umgeworfenen Kamelhaardecke glich, deren Meandermuster einen breiten Streifen um die Schultern bildete. Die breiten bunten Streifen waren aus der Haut wahrscheinlich nicht mehr zu entfernen, und ich erkannte nun, dass das Mädchen und die beiden Amerikaner mich geprägt hatten. (372 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0624 (1951-07-21 - Freiburg)Ernst Jünger schenkte mir eine sehr schöne Facsimile-Ausgabe der Zeichnungen Jean Cocteaus, die ich auf einem Spaziergang mit ihm und seinem Begleiter beschaute, während dieser ihm einen längeren Traum wiedererzählte, den Jünger ihm am Morgen nach dem Erwachen mitgeteilt, dann aber selbst wieder vergessen hatte. Den Inhalt, der lang und sehr interessant war, so dass Jünger selbst im Zuhören über einige Wendungen immer wieder überrascht war, habe ich leider vergessen. Mit der Facsimile-Ausgabe der Zeichnungen Cocteaus hatte es noch einen besondere Bewandtnis. Sie war gebunden wie Giselas Facsimile-Ausgabe der Violin-Sonaten Bachs, die ich zur Zeit bei mir habe. Sie hatte neben meinem Bett an der Mauer gestanden und war von dieser in der Regenzeit durchgefeuchtet, so dass die Zeichungen gelbe Ränder bekommen hatten, die ich später mit dem Radiergummi zu entfernen suchte. Dazu ist bemerkenswert: ich habe unter meinen Büchern eine allerdings nur primitiv brochierte Ausgabe der Zeichnungen Cocteaus "de la table ronde" aus dem Institut Français liegen. In meinem Traumbuch nun kamen aus diesem Exemplar gerade die Zeichnungen vor, die die Eifersucht des Artus darstellen und die ich immer mit Genugtuung betrachtet habe. Dort gibt es ein Bild (la jalousie d'Artus), wo er der Frau eine Ohrfeige auszuteilen scheint, was dadurch ausgedrückt ist, dass sein Arm schon ausholt, ihr Gesicht aber von einem merkwürdig dunklen Fleck verdeckt ist. Specht hat diese Zeichnung auf einem Blatt kopiert (unter dem Titel "Die Ohrfeige by Jean Cocteau"), das ebenfalls zwischen meinen Büchern liegt. Mit den Regenflecken hat es nun folgende Bewandtnis: auf der einen Seite spielt dies Bild der Ohrfeige mit dem verdunkelnden Flecken hinein, auf der anderen Seite die Befürchtung, die Facsimile-Ausgabe Bachs, die bei diesem Traumbild Pate gestanden hat, könne bei Regen unter meinem Fenster Schaden leiden. Endlich an die Wand direkt neben meinem Bett, die im Traum durchfeuchtet war, stelle ich zuweilen Bilder, die ich vor dem Schlafengehen betrachten will, so vor allem Aktaufnahmen. Hier verdichten sich also die Eifersucht und die Leidenschaft mit dem Symbol der Überflutung, die im Flecken sichtbar wird. Die Rolle Cocteaus ist in meinen Vorstellungen im Augenblick sehr entscheidend, da ich mir ihn zum Lehrmeister wünsche, seit ich den Film Orphée gesehen habe. In dieses Buch nun war Jüngers Widmung eingeschrieben, wie in die Ausgabe der goldenen Muschel und Myrduns, die er mir nach seiner Rückkehr aus Antibes schickte. Ich wartete damals eine Weile mit der Antwort, und so war ich im Traum sehr verwirrt, weil ich nicht wusste, ob ich mich schon für die die Cocteau-Ausgabe bedankt hatte. - (Anderer Traum). Auf der Strasse (Schwerin) tanzten Neger. Einer fuhr auf Rollschuhen sehr schnell dahin. Dann kam ein amerikanisches Auto (Jeep) entgegen, auf dem auf einer braun-gelben Decke die Einrichtung eines Indianerzeltes und zwei Leichen ausgebreitet waren. Die toten Indianer trugen Sonnenbrillen. Ich schrie dem Auto nach: "Ihr seid Mörder, Ihr verruchten Hunde, Ihr seid Mörder, nur wegen eines Skalps". Aufwachen mit Erregung und Herzklopfen. - (Anderer Traum). Auf der Strasse (Schwerin) tanzten Neger. Einer fuhr auf Rollschuhen sehr schnell dahin.

Gisela stand in schwarzer Kleidung neben mir in dem Raum, in dem man auf den Sarg wartete. Neben ihr trug jemand die kleinen Kinder auf dem Arm. Gisela wurde sehr traurig und wir gingen in einen Nebenraum, wo sie zu weinen begann. Dann war der Leichenwagen gekommen, aber als wir in den Raum zurückkamen, stand da nicht ein richtiger Sarg, sondern nur eine ringsum geschlossene Tragbahre aus glattem Holz, wie man sie zum ersten Transport der Toten verwendet und die in der Form an ägyptische Mumiensärge erinnern, da sie auf die Raummasse des Körpers zugeschnitten sind.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0631 (1951-07-27 - Freiburg)Traum von einem Mädchen mit leuchtend blaugeschminkten Lippen, die wie ein strahlender Rahmen Mund und Zähne säumten. Wohl eine Vorstellung im nachbildhaften Farben. Das Gesicht hatte strahlende, beglückende Züge. Dann von dieser Kammer, in der ich zusammen mit Gisela und meinem Bruder schlief. Der Raum war eng, doch das Erwachen heiter. Mein Bruder war zum Spassen aufgelegt, Gisela versonnen und verspielt, entkleidete sich schliesslich ganz und ich fasste sie lange ins Auge. Später sah ich aus meinem anders gestellten Bett durch ein klares gläsernes Fenster über eine weite Landschaft bis zu den Vogesen, die sich mit den weissbeschneiten Kuppen deutlich am Ende des Bildes abhoben. Mir fällt dazu jetzt das Bild Van Goghs, die Landschaft mit dem blauen Wagen, ein, das ungeheuer tief, gegliedert am Ende den Blick in den leichten Mittelgebirgszügen fängt, das unter meinem Fenster steht, aus welchem man bei klarem Wetter am Horizont über der Stadt als blauen, wolkenhaften Streifen die Vogesen sieht. Mit Gisela sprach ich gestern abend über einige Bilder van Goghs, darunter eine Landschaft, deren Tiefe sie beglückte. Später änderte sich der Traum, ich kniete auf meinem Stuhl, hatte das Lukenfenster hochgeschlagen, und sah auf die Dinge direkt hinter dem abfallenden Dach, die ich sonst übersehen hatte. Da war ein Kanal, wie ich später merkte, die Dreisam, über die Brücken führten, jenseits seiner eine Autostrasse. Dann setzte sich das Ganze in Bewegung. Die Kammer war in einem Zug. Wir bogen von dem Kanal ab und näherten uns den Bergen. Ich merkte immer mehr, wie alle diese Bilder nur Traumbilder waren, blieb jedoch noch eine Weilte mit geschlossenen Augen liegen und nahm sie in das allmähliche Erwachen hinein. (273 words)

Später beobachtete ich aus einem der Zimmer dieses Hauses eine Achterbahn, die genau bis zur Höhe des Fensters anstieg, so dass ich den Insassen des Wagens ins Gesicht sehen konnte. Endlich in einem dieser Zimmer, in welchen -- wie in einem Freudenhaus -- für Geld, das man auf den Tisch legte -- Aktmodelle zum Zeichnen verkauft wurden. Es handelte sich um geringe Summen, fünfzig oder siebzig Pfennig. Ich wunderte mich zunächst, erfuhr dann aber, dass es sich nur um ein Modell für einen Abend handle. (133 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0642 (1951-08-09 - Wittmoldt)Gespräche mit Heidegger auf dem Ziegeldach eines Hauses. Zum Teil sehr mühsam auf dem Dachfirst kletternd und in stetiger Absturzgefahr. Die Lage meiner Freiburger Mansarde spielte dabei eine Rolle. Zuletzt noch bei dem Einstieg in die Luke drohten Blätter und Flaschen hinabzustürzen. Die beschriebenen Blätter rettete ich. Die Flaschen dagegen fielen in die Dachrinne, wo ich sie zunächst stehen liess, da ich zur ihrer Bergung nicht mehr die Kraft hatte und auf dem schrägen roten Dach abgeglitten wäre. Etwas weiter unten sah ich Gesine am Fenster ihrer Mansarde hantieren. Sie benutzte die Dachrinne zum Kühlstellen der Flaschen, die ihr von ihrem Fenster aus so greifbar blieben. Später spielte Plessner eine Rolle, der mit der Gestalt Heideggers zusammenhing. Er gab meiner Mutter einen Beleg über meinen Zustand in dem Käfig. Wir warteten dabei auf dem Bahnsteig einer Kleinbahn. Kurz ehe die Lokomotive kam, fiel meine Sonnenbrille auf die Schienen. Ich wollte sie retten, stiess dabei mit dem Fuss dagegen und zertrümmerte sie. Zuletzt war meine Mutter krank, jedoch im Zustand vorübergehender Besserung. Als sie eine Weile unseren Gastgebern berichtet hatte, trieb ich sie zum Aufbruch, da ihr das Sprechen zuviel geworden wäre. (191 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0643 (1951-08-10 - Wittmoldt)Fahrt mit einer kleinen und schmalen und offenen Eisenbahn, auf der man wie auf einem Karussell sass. Ich war mit Gisela aus dem Norden Bremens bis nach Freiburg gekommen und auf dem Rückweg. Wir durchquerten -- das Verkehrsmittel hatte sich nun wohl geändert - , eine Stadt, in der der Verkehr lautlos vor sich ging. Gepflegte breite Strassen, durch die die Kolonnen der Autos rollten und eine fürstlich heitere Barockkirche. Es war der Sitz des Erzbischofs, gegen dessen moralische Tiraden in Freiburg ich eine Abscheu hegte. Vorher die Besteigung eines Aussichtsturms, der in seiner Eisenkonstruktion der offenen Eisenbahn glich und dessen Besteigung ähnlicher Vorsicht bedurfte. Die beiden Bilder gingen überhaupt ineinander über. So war es vor allem wichtig, sich an den zu zweien und in Form der Quadrille angelegten Sitzen gut festzuhalten und nicht von der Fliehkraft fortgerissen zu werden. Ähnliches galt von dem ob der leichten Bauweise leise schwankenden Turm. Merkwürdig war es, dass man festen Grund erreichte, nachdem man schon lange gestiegen war. Es musste an der bergigen Form der Landschaft liegen. Überhaupt gingen Steigen und Fahren in ihrer Bewegung ineinander über. (184 words)

Jemand redet von der Reife: "Die müssten seit dem ersten September reif sein, wie die Schönheitsköniginnen". Die Baumgärtnerin sagt: "Da war neulich eine bei mir sogar, - eine kalmarische Medizinstudentin, die hier in der Nähe ihr Quartier aufgeschlagen hat, und den Käfig (meine Stube also) zum Arbeiten haben wollte. Wenn er frei gewesen wäre. Die hatte so schöne Glieder, dass ich mich immer wieder nach ihr umgesehen habe". (Die Baumgärtnerin ist Malerin). Dann erzählte sie ihre Geschichte (die ich bald von der Stimme der Studentin selber hörte, dann auch als Traumhandlung sah): "Ich wurde von einer Freundin aufgefordert, da hin zu fahren. Das tat ich auch. Der Dirigent war gerade beim Spielen. Meine Freundin sagte, ich sollte ihn einfach unterbrechen. Da sagte ich, ich muss mich erst mal nach der Reise waschen, und dann gingen wir an das Wasser und ich sagte: Ich bin so braun, dass ich mich ganz ausziehen kann. Da sagte meine Freundin so laut, dass es der Dirigent hören konnte: Nur unter den Achseln ist sie noch etwas weiss, sonst ist sie überall so braun, auch in der Mitte und unten." Da schielte der Dirigent schon etwas nach ihr hin und nachher unterbrach er seine Musik. (219 words)

Später fuhr ich auf Emmis Fahrrad und begegnete Ingemarie und ihrem Mann, die gestern hier waren. Das Fahrrad war indessen so hoch in der Lenkstange, dass ich die Arme nach oben ausrecken musste, um zu fahren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0650 (1951-08-20 - Wittmoldt)Vater wollte unsere Lembach-Handzeichung zu dem Bismarck-Bild neu rahmen lassen. Er hatte sie dazu aus dem alten Rahmen genommen, und es stellte sich heraus, dass auf dem unsichtbaren Teil des Papiers noch mehrere sehr schöne Engelsköpfe in barocker Art skizziert waren. Mein Vater hielt sie nicht für echt und wollte diesen Teil des Papiers abreissen, da er ihn wegen seiner helleren Farbe nur für angeklebt hielt und annahm, meine Mutter hätte das gemacht. Ich wollte gerne das Stück als Ganzes erhalten und flehte ihn an, bis er endlich die schon zum Riss angesetzte Hand zurücknahm. Ich hatte dabei grosse Angst und erwachte mit starkem Herzklopfen, während mich noch lange das Bild der Engelsköpfe verfolgte. (114 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0652 (1951-08-22 - Wittmoldt)Rückfahrt mit Emmi nach Freiburg -- im Wagen Martin Heideggers. Die Hauptstrasse war gesperrt. So fuhren wir eine kleine, steil ansteigende Nebenstrasse, die tunnelartig gewunden nach dem Prinzip einer Achterbahn angelegt war: Man wurde mit kleinen Zahnradketten hochgeschoben. Nach der Überwindung des Höhepunktes tauchte vor uns das Münster auf mit mächtigem dreigeteiltem Längsschiff, das Dach besetzt mit einer Fülle kleiner Dachreiter im heiteren Stil, die Filigranarbeit des Turmes im Nebel fast verborgen. Zu sagen ist noch, dass wir aus Heideggers Auto ausstiegen, als er in die Nebenstrasse einbog, jedoch noch auf dem Kotflügel weiterfuhren, als wir merkten, dass sein Weg doch in die Stadt führe.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0653 (1951-08-23 - Wittmoldt)Traum von der Griechin aus der Kunstakademie, die jedoch zugleich die Züge von Brigitte trug (mit der und deren Freund ich gestern auf dem Lanker-See paddelte). Wir betrachteten ein Aktbildnis, dessen Figur ähnlich wie die alten Fruchtbarkeitsgöttinnen viele Brüste hatte. Umstehende lachten, doch sie erklärte ihnen, dass dies völlig ernst sei. Später sassen wir allein auf einem Bett und ich tastete ihre Glieder ab. Als ich die Oberschenkel berührte, sagte sie: "Das darfst du nicht" in dem gebrochenen Deutsch, das ein Ausländer spricht. Doch ich widersprach und handelte nicht danach. Später befanden wir uns mit dem Bett in dem grossen Jungenszimmer in Wittmoldt, in dem viele Jungens und Mädchen durcheinander schliefen -- etwas zur Verwunderung der "Erwachsenen". Das Bett war wunderbar leicht gefedert und wiegend wie ein Boot. Zuletzt in einem Szenenwechsel wandelte es sich in einen ganz leichten Dogcard-Wagen, von einem trabenden Pferd gezogen, den ich fast spielend lenkte und beinahe liegend ausgestreckt. Andere Szenen waren mit dem Traum verquickt. So ging ich mit der Griechin in einen Raum, in dem bis vor kurzem ein Toter gelegen hatte, und suchte dort die Bettwäsche. Auch später beim Essen waren die Toten anwesend, so die alte Frau v.K. (197 words)

Zugleich schaute man genau winkelrecht zu dieser Anlage auf das Ludwigsluster Schloss. Wir begaben uns nun schwebend in einer Bahn in Richtung auf das Schloss zu, und während dieser Fahrt tauchten wie Sterne in wunderbarer geometrischer Ordnung die übrigen Bauwerke der Stadt, so der Dom, auf, die aus dem Grün hervorstrebten. -- Später Traum von Barbara Köhler, die mir zur Veröffentlichung des Webetanzes helfen wollte.

Ich fasste mir ein Herz und trat dazwischen, um sie zu verscheuchen. Sie schimpften zwar, waren aber eingeschüchtert.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0683 (1951-09-28 - Göttingen)Ich wohnte sehr hoch in einem Hause und schaute hinaus auf die Strasse. Unten stand Gisela, frech die Beine etwas gespreizt, und war wie ein grosses Mädchen. Später, ich hatte mich von oben mit ihr über ihre neuesten Arbeitsmöglichkeiten unterhalten, sie verkaufte nämlich Apparate für den Apfelsinenbaum und musste dafür nach Afrika oder an die Nordsee reisen, wo man Apfelsinen baute, - später also kamen einige andere Mädchen, die sehr steif aussahen, und sehr dünne, kalkweisse Beine hatten. Sie waren wie zu einem Umzug formiert, denn es war der erste Mai. Gisela liess sich von ihnen mitnehmen, denn sie meinte: "Wenn ich bei den Leutchen arbeite, muss ich wohl auch mit ihnen marschieren." Dann kam ein jüngerer Mann die Strasse lang, hob etwas auf: "Hier liegt ein Halstuch, das hat jemand liegengelassen, das darf aber nicht sein." Er zeigte es hoch: "Wem gehört das?" Es war mein wollenes Halstuch, das mir Emmi einmal schenkte, und ich rief: "Hier". Er warf es an die Ecke meines Hauses, und ich ging aus der Wohnung und segelte auf dem Geländer die vielen Treppen hinunter. Eine Etage unter mir wohnte Gisela. Ich dachte im Vorbeigehen: wie schön, so dicht beieinander zu wohnen, das hätte Gisela noch bis vor kurzem nicht für gut gehalten. Unten war ich ganz taumelig von den vielen Kurven des Treppengeländers und suchte mir halb kriechend, halb an den Wänden gehend, den Weg durch den noch dunklen Flur. Draussen auf der kleinen Haustreppe, ungefähr da, wo mein Tuch hingefallen war, lag Kottmeier, um sich auszuruhen, doch so auf den Stufen, dass die Beine oben lagen und der Kopf ganz unten. Er hatte seine Mütze in den Nacken gelegt, und das Gesicht war ganz von schwarzer Erde beschmiert, als wäre er aus dem Moor gekommen, aber er schien das in der Ordnung zu finden. (302 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0690 (1951-10-04 - Freiburg)Beim Arzt. Ich habe mir den Kopf gestossen (so wie Gisela gestern). Der Arzt ist sehr besorgt (so wie Giselas Eltern gestern) und ordnet eine umständliche Behandlung an. Die Anordnung ist aber illusorisch, denn ich will schon am Nachmittag auf Reisen gehen. Jedoch der Arzt und einer seiner Patienten, ein Herr von Sowieso, laden mich zu einem Kirmesfest im Orte ein. Das Angebot ist verlockend, doch ich lehne ab. Ich ging zunächst zu Fuss, reiste dann auf einem Fahrzeug, einer kleinen Landmaschine, deren federnder Eisensitz sehr dicht über der Erde war, man sass fast liegend. Grosse Räder, die die Sicht nach vorne hinderten, und eine Antriebskraft, die mir unbekannt war. Mit diesem Fahrzeug rollte ich über die Feldwege, zuweilen den Saaten ausweichend, vor allem als Polizei in der Nähe war. Einmal standen in einem Hohlweg Katzen im Wege. Eine sprang nicht schnell genug hinweg, und ich hörte einen Aufschrei, wie man ihn zuweilen nachts von Frauen hört, denn ich war ihr über das Bein gefahren. Ich hatte nun eine Begleiterin, die mich vor mir selbst entschuldigte. Es war eine Reiterin im dunklen Reitanzug mit einer eleganten Jockey-Mütze. Ich folgte ihr mit einem zweiten Pferd im gemessenen Abstand. Ich trug einen roten Rock und Zylinder. Nach einer Weile kam uns eine Jagdgesellschaft entgegen und die Reiterin wollte ihres Renommés wegen jetzt das zweite Pferd neben sich haben. Mich ärgerte dieser Zug, und ich stieg deswegen ab und jagte ihr das zweite Pferd ohne Reiter nach. Indessen sah ich schon von unten ein anderes Pferd entgegenkommen und befürchtete einen Zusammenstoss. Das andere Pferd kam immer schneller heran und ich fürchtete, da die Strasse furchtbar schmal war, nun selbst von dem galoppierenden Tier überrannt zu werden. Ich erinnerte mich, kurz vorher eine Nische gesehen zu haben, und tastete mich zu dieser zurück, die Gasse war jetzt nicht breiter als mein Körper und wie von Schränken gebildet, zuweilen so eng, dass ich mich nur noch hindurch-quetschen konnte. Auch wurde ich -- wie vom Sturm -- von einer unsichtbaren Macht zurückgehalten. Ich krallte die Finger hinter kleine Vorsprünge und Leisten und versuchte, mit ausgestrecktem Arm mich weiter heranzuziehen. Die erste Nische war zu eng. Schliesslich hatte ich die richtige erreicht, in der ich gerade Platz hatte. Das Pferd schien den Eingang in die Gasse nicht gefunden zu haben. Als ich mich langsam vorbeugte, sah ich jedoch einen Schatten und bald darauf ein Geweih um einen Vorsprung auftauchen, das dem Schatten voraus geworfen hatte. Dann stand der Hirsch vor mir. Ich drückte mich in die Nische, in die er mit dem breiten Geweih nicht hinein konnte, und streichelte ihm die Nase. Später jedoch beugte der Hirsch seinen Kopf nieder, um mit dem Geweih meinen Fuss zu beharken, der aus der Nische hervorragte. Ich erwachte mit dem Gedanken, so wie Nicolai Hartmann auf dem einsamen Weg zum Mount Wilson die Adler, die in bedrohlicher Nähe kreisten, durch die Gebärde des Anlegens verscheuchte, mich auch aus dieser Nische zu befreien.

Ich mochte ihn am Morgen nicht aufschreiben, da er mich in Missstimmung versetzte. Erst beim Erzählen leuchtete mir sein Sinn ein. Nach Anderem, das ich vergessen habe: Ich drang mit einem Gewehr bewaffnet in ein Zimmer ein, in dem Banditen waren. Als ich abdrücken wollte, stellte sich heraus, dass die Waffe ungeladen war. In diesem kritischen Moment schlug einer der Räuber eine Pistole gegen mich an. Ich ergriff ihn bei der Faust und versuchte, die Waffe abzuwenden und auf seine Kumpanen zu richten. Ich drückte ab, als es nach einigem Ringen gelang. Da spritzte eine braune Masse heraus, die in alle Richtungen zerstob und die Getroffenen mit kleinen Spritzern übersäte. "Wissen Sie, womit Sie geschossen haben?" fragte der Besitzer der Pistole. "Nein". - "Mit Kaffee". Ich musste sehr lachen, aber einer der Getroffenen erwiderte: "Sie haben gut lachen. Wenn Sie wüssten, wie das brennt!" Es war eine Art von gebranntem noch glühend heissem Kaffee, oder, das was zurückbleibt, wenn man die Bohnen aus der Pfanne nimmt. Dann kam der Kommissar und verhaftete mich. Er führte mich in eine Amtszimmer und sagte: "Sie werden jetzt die Folgen tragen müssen von dem, was Sie angerichtet haben." (203 words)

Ich klopfte an die Tür, die die richtige zu sein schien, und hörte noch verschlafen: "Herein". Brigitte lag im Bett. Das Zimmer trug Züge von meiner und Giselas Göttinger Wohnungen. Das Problem war nun, wie ich so barfuss und zur unmöglichen Stunde in diesem strengen -- Margunds -- Elternhaus zu rechtfertigen war. Wir bedachten allerlei Versteckmöglichkeiten, die aber zu klein waren. Indessen schlich draussen vor dem Glasfenster in der oberen Türfüllung eine Gipsplastik -- Dante-ähnlich im Profil -- vorbei, die, wie ich danach sah, von Margunds Bruder getragen wurde, dessen Gesicht ich einen Augenblick wahrnahm. Ich drückte mich in die Ecke, doch er hatte mich schon gesehen und trat sehr heiter herein. Von ihm war keine Gefahr zu befürchten. Auch Ika spielte gesprächsweise hinein, doch als ob sie -- statt Brigittes -- in Preetz war und so, als wenn ich über sie mit Gisela spräche. (179 words)

Eine dicke, aber freundliche Frau kommt, um ihn sich wieder zu holen. Sein Knurren ist freundlich gemeint, doch habe ich Angst, er könnte trotzdem zuschnappen, wenn ich mit dem Fuss über ihn wegtrete. Ich warte darum, bis die Frau ihn hat aufstehen lassen. Dann ist da noch ein Jagdhund mit Schlappohren, den ich als den meinen, oder der Familie zugehörig erkenne, bei der ich lebe. Er springt mich freundlich an und folgt mir, die Hand fest zwischen seine Kiefer genommen, doch so, dass er nicht beisst, sondern nur die Hand fest zwischen den fleischigen Teilen hält. (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0702 (1951-10-12 - Freiburg)Bei meinem Bruder. Gedichte an der Wand, die sich in rührender Weise mit seinen und meinen Lieben beschäftigen, nach dem Schema des Verzichts und neuer Hoffnung. Eines von ihnen, das mich betrifft, will ich auslöschen, weil es mich ärgert. Es ist aber in einer sehr anständigen Schrift geschrieben und von sehr gekonnten Zeichnungen, die farbig sind, begleitet, etwa im Stile Cézannes. Unter den Zeichnungen steht die Urheberschaft "Ich bin's J.S.B." (70 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0703 (1951-10-16 - Freiburg)Ich kam mit Franz vom Bahnhof. Wir unterhielten uns über Gisela in einer Atmosphäre tiefen Einverständnisses, doch nicht auf Grund eines Vertrages, sondern auf Grund von Freundschaft. Auch duzten wir uns. Er sagte: "Ich muss hier noch mal nach jemandem gucken, Du kannst schon mal gehen und Zigaretten holen." Wir einigten uns über die Marke, dann ging ich. Doch traumverloren kam ich zuerst in die Post. Ich kehrte sofort um und fürchtete, nun Franz zu verfehlen. Ich pfiff darum leise das Thema aus dem 1. Satz des Beethoven-Konzertes, bekam aber sofort Antwort. Unterwegs sah ich einige Tierplastiken, die ein Antiquar auf der Strasse ausgestellt hatte und von denen ich eine stark stilisierte zu kaufen dachte. Sie hatte die Farbe eines schwarzen Kiesels und die Formen sehr eleganter Flutlinien, wie sie das Meer auf einem Steine einschleift. (136 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0704 (1951-10-17 - Freiburg)Kein Friedhof, kein Direktor, kein Regisseur: Strassenbahnhaltestelle. König. Diese Worte standen auf einer Tafel in dem Gartengelände hinter unserem Haus in Schwerin, dicht am Franzosenweg, in schwarzer Schrift auf weissem Grunde. Ich wusste, dass Gisela und ihre Freunde das im Spass getan hatten. Sie hatten auf einen Wegweiser die ersten drei Worte durch diese drei "Keine" ersetzt. Das einsame, ein wenig verwahrloste Vorstadt-Gartengelände sah so aus, dass man dort in der Nähe ein Atelier oder einen Friedhof vermuten könnte. Indessen früher hatte es an der Stelle überhaupt keinen Wegweiser gegeben. -- Dem Traum heute Nacht gingen noch andere Szenen voran: Ich wohnte wieder in unserem alten Kinderzimmer, das später die Familie Tosch bezogen hatte. Ich ging in das gegenüber liegende Klosett, das in einem Holzverschlag unter der Bodentreppe angebracht war -- doch der Raum war viel grösser, anstatt des alten wackeligen Beckens standen dort viele weisse Waschwannen und Becken verschiedenster Art mit schwellenden weissen Böschungen und blitzenden Hähnen. Das Klosett war als eines unter ihnen kaum zu finden, es brannte nur ein rotes Notlicht, viele Schalter waren an der Wand, und doch mit keinem konnte man ein Licht entzünden. Draussen flüsterte die Familie T., weil ich in ihr Allerheiligstes eingedrungen war. Der Raum wirkte wie eine Kultstätte, und ich verliess ihn eingeschüchtert, ehe ich mich gesetzt hatte. -- Eine andere Traumszene, an die dann jene mit dem Wegweiser anschloss: Ich lief den einsamen Gartenweg hinab, nur noch mit einem weissen Bademantel bekleidet, und legte mich ins Gras, die Beine entblössend, damit sie von der noch warmen Herbstsonne beschienen würden. Doch schloss ich den Spalt des Mantels so weit wieder, dass die Scham bedeckt war. Dann gab ich mich der Wärme der Sonne hin. Ich hörte ein Freudengeheul von Gesine und ihren Freundinnen, die im Spiel den Weg hinunter gelaufen kamen. Ich veränderte meine Lage jedoch nicht. (306 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0705 (1951-10-18 - Freiburg)Besuch von Professor Heiss. Wir sitzen im Atelier der Baumgärtnerin bei den vielen Wachskerzen. Heiss erzählt Geschichten von Kant. Unter anderem diese: "Er hatte auch einen Oberbau -- richtig aus Holz -, das war der Sternenhimmel -- da kam der Ritter her. Der stieg von da hinab." - Zweiter Traum: Abends Traum kurz nach dem Einschlafen: Ein Mann wollte mir den Kopf zwischen die Tür einklemmen. Ich sagte: "Sie sind ja wahnsinnig",und schützte den Kopf mit den erhobenen Händen. Ich mochte sein Gesicht nicht antasten, obwohl es mir mit den Händen greifbar war. Dann rief ich die Leute hinter mir um Hilfe an mit den Worten: "He, helft mir doch", da er nicht nachliess, und wachte mit wahnsinniger Angst auf und starkem Herzklopfen, den Kopf zwischen die Arme eingeklemmt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0706 (1951-10-19 - Freiburg)Traum von Elisabeth Baumgarten. Ich hatte den Ziehwagen für sie an die Strassenkante gestellt und ging fort, als sie noch etwa drei Meter von dem Wagen entfernt war. Er geriet auf dem leicht abfallenden Gelände ins Rollen, und sie konnte ihn vor Schreck nicht aufhalten, lief jedoch entsetzt neben ihm her. Der Wagen entschwand mitten im Verkehr. Ein grosses Lastauto und ein Anhänger mit einer Art Deichsel fuhren ineinander. Ich fürchtete, der Baumgärtnerin sei etwas zugestossen und lief hinterher, sah sie jedoch jenseits der Kreuzung am Strassenrand stehen. Die Leute zogen gerade die Fahrzeuge auseinander, die fast unversehrt geblieben waren. Nur von dem Ziehwagen, der ein wenig abseits stand, waren ein Rad und die Deichsel zertrümmert. Ich dachte nach dem Erwachen noch lange über die Schuldfrage nach. Elisabeth Baumgarten, der ich den Traum erzählte, schrieb mir die Schuld zu. (139 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0710 (1951-10-22 - Freiburg)Ich war im Traum in den verschiedensten Räumen und Zimmern, von meiner Mansarde angefangen, Göttinger Raumverhältnissen, einer Garage, Klosetts, geheimnisvollen Gängen unter Kirchentüren, Baracken, bis zu Räumlichkeiten aus früheren Träumen, die alle zu einer Einheit zusammengeschmolzen waren, in der dicht unter der Oberfläche schwebenden Räumlichkeit eines ausgedehnten Morgenschlafs. Dann wieder war ich im Urwald bei wilden Tieren, die ich erlegen musste. Ein Löwe, vor dem ich mich auf einen Baum zu retten suchte, um dann einen Stein auf ihn herabzuwerfen. Auch Hunde kamen heran, doch war alles sehr undeutlich. In allem war ich froh, als ich erwachend den Kopf aus dem Fenster steckte und unten das herrliche gelbe Herbstlaub sah, das der Regen gewaschen hatte. (115 words)

Dann im Traum Gespräch mit Gisela über den Symbolcharakter dieses Traums. Die Hauthaftigkeit der Kacheln. Das Feuer im Leibesinneren, die Scheide als Zugang zu jenem Feuer.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0718 (1951-11-01 - Freiburg)Traum von Handschuhen. Ich habe mehrere Paare, darunter drei lederne (die übrigens den dreien gleichen, die ich besitze) an mich genommen in einem grossen Baukomplex von Räumen und Gängen, der wie ein abgeschlossenes Barackenlager oder das ausgedehnte Innere eines Schiffsbaus ist. In dem Kasten, in dem ich die Handschuhe habe, sind auch noch leinene, in weissen, roten und bunten Farben (wie Dreieckbadehosen). Es findet nun unter der Mannschaft anscheinend eine Art Handschuhverteilung statt. Eine Frau entdeckt mich mit einem Kasten in einem Gang und sagt: "Ah, da sind ja die Handschuhe, die uns gerade noch fehlen für den Soundso und den Soundso und so weiter, die noch keine haben." Sie geht noch einmal fort, und diesen Moment benutze ich, um den Kasten zu ergreifen und in Windeseile durch eine Tür, die glücklicherweise offen ist, mit dem Kasten unter dem Arm aus dem Lager zu entweichen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0719 (1951-11-02 - Freiburg)Traum von Brigitte. Folgende Vorgeschichte: Beim Bäcker. Eine Frau kauft Kuchen und eine Tasse Kaffee und dann -- einen kleinen Flügel. Dieser wird nun geschoben durch einen eigentlich unbestimmten Raum -- wie auf einer Bühne. Das heisst: Eigentlich soll der Transport erst beginnen. Alles wird gut geschlossen. Mein Vater ordnet die letzten Handgriffe an. Aber dann liegt plötzlich ein Mann auf dem Bauch auf dem Flügel, um noch etwas zu ändern. Ich finde es unerhört. Er zieht irgendwo einen Hebel heraus. Der Flügel wird gespielt, aber er klingt nun -- durch die Verstellung des Hebels -- wie eine Orgel. Zunächst Melodien im Stile von Bach, die dann in weichere, romantische Formen übergleiten. Ich sehe lange, blonde Haare der Spielerin, oben hinter dem Flügel hin und her wehen, und den Kopf, der im Takt geworfen wird. Dann erkenne ich Brigitte. Erwachen. (140 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0721 (1951-11-04 - Freiburg)Traum von einem indischen Gottesdienst und vom theologischen Seminar, wo ich die Bibliotheken durchstöberte. Doch der Direktor des Seminars (Wolf) erkannte mich nicht mehr. In einer vorhergegangenen Szene war es übrigens das Musikwissenschaftliche Seminar, wo ich altes Notenpapier für Giselas Vater suchte, in dessen Haus ich davor zum Essen -- dort nur halb geduldet -- gewesen war. Der indische Gottesdienst war in einer modernisierten, aber ganz indischen Kirche. Man musste sich bis auf eine Dreieckshose entkleiden.- Ich trug eine solche aus dem gelben Stoff, den ich mir für ein Halstuch kaufte. Die Beter mussten auf dem Boden auf den Knien entlang rutschen. Dafür gab es eigentlich kleine Rollwägelchen, die hier aber fehlten. Vor dem Gottesdienst wurde zwanglos geplaudert, auch Schokolade gegessen. Ich begrüsste Bekannte, so auch den jungen Kai und Ingemarie und ihren Mann, deren Hände ich versehentlich auf einmal ergriff. (141 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0722 (1951-11-11 - Heidelberg)Mit Marion auf der Schwebebahn. Wir schweben immer höher, flach auf dem Bauch auf dem Dach der Bahn liegend. Als das Land ganz unter uns zurückweicht, haben wir grosse Angst, herunterzufallen, und klammern uns ganz fest an. Schliesslich, oben auf dem Bergplateau angelangt, das bereits zur Schweiz gehört, gleiten wir schnell und unauffällig vom Dach der Bahn hinab, weil ein Polizist mit weisser Mütze sichtbar wird und wir weder Pass noch Fahrgeld haben.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0723 (1951-11-12 - Heidelberg)Träume von Marion und von Ernst Jünger.

Ich bewunderte die Fülle der Produktion. (40 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0724 (1951-11-15 - Freiburg)Traum von einem Kamel, das mich liebkoste. Es war in einer Strasse, in der eine Kolonne von Kamelen mit kleinen Schritten, die sich zuweilen in die Lüfte hoben, fortzog. Vorher von einer ganz modernen Strassenbahn, die bis Paris oder Italien fahren sollte. Sie wurde gewendet, zwar so, dass dabei die Vorderräder aus den Schienen herausliefen und in grossem Schwung der ganze Wagen umschwang, um dann in die Schienen zurückzuspringen. Ich stand in dem Raum, der durch diesen Schwung gefährdet war, flüchtete mich bis an eine Hausecke, vor der aber der Wagen mich getroffen hätte, wenn er sich ganz aus den Schienen gelöst hätte. Das Kamel spielte übrigens, bevor es mich liebkoste, mit dem Gesicht eines kleinen Jungen. Das Tier war in seiner Grösse schön und stolz, erregend und zugleich milde -- der übliche Sinn von "Kamel" schien in dem Traum ausgeschaltet, wie wir ja überhaupt im Traum dem Eigentlichen der Tiere näher sind als im Schimpfwort.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0727 (1951-11-21 - Freiburg)Gestern in Heidelberg Traum von einem Wagen mit zwei Pferden, den ich lenkte. Ein Mann knallte mit der Peitsche und machte meine Pferde wild, so dass sie über einen kleinen Zaun sprangen. Ich zog sie im letzten Moment zurück, ehe sich der Wagen dort verfing, so dass sie den Sprung gleichsam rückwärts wiederholten und der Wagen rückwärts lief. Der Mann indessen knallte weiter mit der Peitsche, obwohl ich ihm zurief, er solle es lassen. (74 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0730 (1951-11-26 - Freiburg)Ein Wolf ist geschlachtet, offenbar zur Fütterung der Menschen und Tiere. Ich trage ihn im Rucksack und begegne drei Windhunden, die sofort das Fleisch gewittert haben und mich anfallen wollen. Zu meinem Glück sind sie an Leinen festgebunden und ich kann aus ihrem Bannkreis fliehen, aber ich kann nun die Strasse nicht zu Ende gehen, da der Radius der Leinen, an denen die Hunde laufen, die Strasse fast bis an die Mauer bestreicht. In dem schmalen freien Streifen sehe ich gerade, wie eine ältere Frau mit drei schwarzen Dackeln sich versucht durchzudrücken. Sie fallen dabei auf die Seite, es gibt ein Durcheinander, die Windhunde reissen sich los und werden zunächst von der Frau mit den Dackeln abgewehrt und beschäftigt. Ich benutze die Gelegenheit und stürze in der Richtung meines Weges durch den ehemaligen Bannkreis der Hunde fort, doch diese, die nun frei sind, haben mich bald eingeholt. Ich nehme den schweren Rucksack (mit dem toten Wolf) ab und bin im Begriffe, ihn um mich zu schleudern, zur Abwehr der Hunde. Erwachen, weil meine Haustürglocke schellt. Der Briefträger brachte mir einen Traum von Ika über das Totenreich. Nun fällt mir eine weitere, vorhergehenden Szene aus meinem Traum ein: Ich will per Anhalter fahren und verlasse dafür das Stadtzentrum zunächst in der Strassenbahn. Ich setze mich neben den Fahrer, zuweilen mit den Beinen zwischen seine Hebel kommend. Lege meinen Rucksack ab und trinke aus meiner Tasse (einer grossen Teetasse, die ich dann wieder im Rucksack verstaue). Der Fahrer nickt zuweilen ein, während die Bahn auf den Schienen sicher weiterrollt. Die Autos weichen ihr von selber aus. Er erzählt im Traum -- vom Totenreich (dieser Traum war aber bevor ich Ikas Brief bekam). Ich höre seine Worte und denke, dass es merkwürdig sein müsse, wenn es jetzt einen Zusammenstoss geben würde und die Worte würden Wirklichkeit. Diese Vorstellung hat etwas fast Beruhigendes.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0733 (1951-11-27 - Freiburg)Dann unter vielen anderen Traumbildern folgendes: Ich gehe, einen Kinderwagen ziehend, durch ein schmales Stadttor, wo die Autos hinter mir warten müssen, in eine alte Stadt -- auf eine Anhöhe am Rande, von der der Blick fällt auf eine wunderbare grüne Wiese. Dort ein stattlicher Rehbock, der schliesslich bis zu mir kommt und das Kind liebhat. Ich halte dabei die Hand vor sein Geweih, damit kein Schaden entsteht. Andere Szene: Ich gehe über einen Schulplatz, wo die Kinder Kugel stossen und dauernd fast meinen Kopf treffen. Andere Szene: Ich betrachte mit anderen, auch mehreren Mädchen, Aktbilder, darunter eines, in dem eine Frau im Wasser steht, aus dem nur Kopf und Becken und der gebeugte Rücken in wunderbarer Plastik hervorragen, während das Wasser leise spielt. Man sieht die Bewegung genau. Moderne Architektur und Fahrzeuge in der Umgebung. Andere Bilder von sehr archaischer Schönheit, fast ägyptischem Charakter. (145 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0734 (1951-11-30 - Freiburg)Neueinzug in ein grosses Zimmer mit breiter und tiefgehender Fensterfront, vor die mehrfach durchsichtige Gardinen gezogen werden, zur Abschirmung von Licht und Einblick. Ich finde Blumen und Früchte im Zimmer vor. Die Atmosphäre ist freundlich, geräumig und patrizisch. Ich beginne, mich zu entkleiden, ziehe noch während dessen die Gardinen vor und lege mich noch mit verhülltem Oberkörper, sonst entkleidet, auf das Bett. Ich höre ein Kichern, sehe ein zweites Bett hinter dem meinen und spüre die Anwesenheit von zwei Mädchen in dem halbdunklen Raum. Die eine, deren blonde Haare ich erblicke, ziehe ich zu mir, küsse sie, wobei ihre Lippen die meinen wie ein Rüssel ergreifen, und werfe mich über sie. Sie beginnt, sich hinzugeben, hält sich aber zugleich zurück mit den Worten: "Ich würde vorsichtig sein, bei einem ganz fremden Menschen: Man kann nie wissen, ob er krank ist." Ich sehe dann das Gesicht, das sehr derb und etwas putig wirkt, mit sinnlich aufgewölbten Lippen. Ich erwache enttäuscht über die Banalität des Erlebens in diesem schönen Zimmer. Im Laufe der Besinnung über den Traum tritt jedoch die Schönheit des Zimmers wieder deutlich hervor, das Erlebnis beginnt, sich als ein eigentlich fremdes von dem Traum abzutrennen. Ich habe das Gefühl, als wenn zwei Träume kombiniert seien. (206 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0735 (1951-11-29 - Freiburg)Bei den Negern, wo wir die Negersprache lernen. Später im psychologischen Institut, wo ich meinem Vater die Mädchen zeige.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0740 (1951-12-05 - Freiburg)Traum von einer geplanten Brückensprengung, die ich entdeckte, und im letzten Moment verriet -- schweren Herzens, da mir der Rebell, der Maler, zwar verfeindet, aber nicht ferne war. Ein grosser technischer Apparat war mit der Abwendung der Sprengung verbunden. Es handelte sich um eine Brücke, die wie eine Zugbrücke in eine Art Schloss oder Burg führte, in dem ich auch lebte (von der Grösse und Modernität etwa einer Rheinbrücke), über die der Bundeskanzler am Tage ihrer Einweihung mit einem modernen Auto fahren sollte. Die ganzen technischen Einzelheiten spielten nun um die Abwendung dieser Sprengung. Dazu kam ein riesiger Stab ins Haus, der aber nicht lückenlos arbeitete, so dass ich ihn dauernd überwachen musste, und ausserdem Militär. Die Fahrt des Kanzlers über die Brücke ist ein Wagnis -- mit grosser Spannung erwartet und tapfer durchgeführt. Man warf Staniolsilber aus der Luft ab, um eine etwaige Fernzündung durch elektrische Strahlungen zu verhindern. Die Überfahrt gelang. (153 words)

Zug um Zug, Gebäude um Gebäude müssen geräumt werden. Autos gehen in Flammen auf. Alles ist unheimlich und unverständlich. Der Flammenbereich nähert sich. Ich sehe einen französischen Soldaten, der mit einem Hammerschlag auf die Schienen die jeweilige Grenze angibt und dann die Menschen aus der Gefahr treibt. Jetzt ertönt der Hammerschlag auf der Schiene unter unserem Zuge. Dann die Austreibung. Mit äusserster Mühe nur gelingt es mir, so schnell zu laufen wie die Gefahr erfordert. Neben mir ein kleiner Junge, den ich am Arm packe und mitziehe. Später merke ich, dass es ein alter Mann ist. (133 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0747 (1951-12-10 - Freiburg)Ein Traumbild der letzten Nacht fiel mir erst heute in Gespräch wieder ein. Ricarda hatte im Gespräch von einem sehr neuen amerikanischen Wagen mit automatischer Gangschaltung erzählt, den sie mit ihrer Mutter fuhr. Diesen Wagen sah ich im Traum, elfenbeinfarben, doch von alter Konstruktion, von steilen und gradlinigen Formen, wie sehr frühe Wagen. Er erhöhte allmählich seine Geschwindigkeit, und jedes Mal, wenn diese eine bestimmte Grenzen überschritten hatte, die eigentlich eine neue Schaltung verlangt hätte, setzte die automatische Schaltung und trieb dabei einen grossen kompakten Hebel seitlich aus dem Wagen heraus, dessen Hervortreten den Vorgang sichtbar machte. Die allmähliche Beschleunigung der Geschwindigkeit wirkte dabei ähnlich zügig und unwirklich wie die des grossen Rolls Noir (Orphée) beim Einfahren in die Zone des Totenreiches. (122 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0749 (1951-12-11 - Freiburg)Traum aus dem Elternhaus. Der See hatte das gesamte Gartengelände überschwemmt, so dass das Haus nun direkt am Wasser stand.

Alles war durchzogen von Heiterkeit. (52 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0750 (1951-12-11 - Freiburg)Andere Träume heute Nacht: Ich ging durch ein unbekanntes Gelände, das aber traummässig mit dem Schweriner Traum zusammenhing, zunächst durch eine fremde Stadt, dann durch ihr leicht bergiges, lehmartiges Vorgelände. Jungens rollten und schmissen mit Steinen, vor denen man sich vorsehen musste. Es waren zum Teil grosse Brocken. Doch da ich sie kannte, liess ich sie. Schliesslich aber, als auch fremde nach mir zielten, durch die ich in die Gefahr des Getroffenwerdens kam, knöpfte ich sie mir vor und stellte sie zur Rede. Später Rückweg in die Stadt, wobei ich mich in eine Sackgasse, eigentlich eine Kette von Höfen, festlief. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0751 (1951-12-15 - Freiburg)Abends: Als eben eine erleuchtete Strassenbahn durch den schwarzen Raum meiner dunklen Fenster fuhr, schienen Traumbilder der letzten Nacht wieder vorbeizuhuschen. Eines, das ich fassen wollte, und das sich heute morgen schon entzog, liess sich jedoch nicht fixieren. Das andere: Kinder (kleine Mädchen), die auch im Winter im Schnee barfuss und mit nackendem Oberkörper spielten. Ich musste, als ich sie sah, mir die Eltern vorstellen, die mir dabei, obwohl ich sie nicht kannte, in ihrer Leidenschaftlichkeit sichtbar schienen. - Von meinem eigenen zweiten Traumbild weiss ich nur noch dieses, dass ein merkwürdiges Changieren darin war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0752 (1951-12-16 - Freiburg)Traumbild: Ein nackter Radfahrer am Franzosenweg (Uferstrasse in Schwerin). Er nutzt die wenigen Strahlen der Wintersonne. Anderes Traumbild: Ich gehe durch ein grosses Zimmer auf eine Gruppe zu, die ich durch ein gebogenes Eckfenster sehe, das von der Decke bis zum Boden reicht. Ich suche dann eine Klappe, die ich öffne, um mit ihnen zu sprechen. Anderes Traumbild: Singen in einem kirchlichen Raum: Vor dem Fenster erscheint ein Amerikaner, der den Raum als Unterkunft beschlagnahmen will. Er ergreift eine Monstranz, um mit Kreide die Beschlagnahme des Raumes darauf zu schreiben. Der schwarz gekleidete Pfarrer (der die Züge des hiesigen Studentenpfarres trägt) nimmt sie ihm langsam wieder weg. (107 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0754 (1951-12-18 - Freiburg)Traum von einem tollwütigen Hunde, der unter meinen Mantel kriechen will, um mich zu beissen. Ich trete die Säume meines Mantels fest mit den Füssen auf den Boden, so dass ein geschlossener Raum entsteht. Schliesslich ist der Hund aber doch eingedrungen. Ich spüre ihn zwischen den Schenkeln emporschnellen und packe im letzten Moment durch das Kleid seinen Kopf und würge ihn. Dann wird er in einen Käfig gesperrt, den ich fest zu Boden drücke, da er keinen Boden hat und der Hund immer wieder versucht, einzelne Glieder, Kopf, Schwanz und Pfoten darunter heraus zu schieben, um sich zu befreien. Bei alledem bin ich mir der ungeheuren Gefahr jedes einzelnen Bisses bewusst. Dann ein Wechsel der Situation: Aus der Ansteckungsgefahr der Tollwut ist die der Schlafkrankheit geworden -- jedoch wie jene übertragbar durch den Biss. Ein Kind ist bereits infiziert. Gemeinsam mit der Mutter und einem hilfsbereiten Mann bringen wir es in einen Eisenbahnwagen. Das Einsteigen gelingt ihnen noch im letzten Moment. Überlegungen über eine mir bevorstehende Reise nach Lübeck (zu Tante Tabitha) spielen in diese Szene hinein, so ob ich nicht auf dem Bahnsteig bleiben und schwarz fahren soll. Ich verlasse dann aber auf einem schmalen Nebenweg den Bahnsteig (einer kleinen Landstation), wobei ich mich zunächst im Garten des Bahnwärters verlaufe, dann aber auf eine Strasse gelange und schliesslich die anderen Glieder der Familie und Emmi wiederfinde. Wir sprechen über die gefährliche Krankheit und ihre Übertragungsmittel. Nicht das Sich-Hüten vor dem Biss des Hundes genügt, sondern schon ein Kuss kann die Krankheit übertragen, wenn ein Mensch die Bazillen der Krankheit trägt. Der Traum ging dann weiter: Ich fuhr mit einem Auto, um aus dem vor der Schlafkrankheit befallenen Gebiet zu entrinnen, wurde indessen selber müde, als es dunkelte, konnte das Licht nicht einschalten und den Bremshebel nicht finden. Dann kam ich durch eine grosse Stadt, in der die Krankheit schon ausgebrochen war. Überall schwankten müde von ihr befallene Gestalten. Ich hatte noch eine gesunde Begleiterin, ich glaube Gisela, im Wagen, konnte aber von den Kranken niemand mitnehmen, da wir dann unweigerlich verloren gewesen wären. Schliesslich hielt ich ausserhalb der Stadt an, lief einen kleinen gewundenen Pfad von der Strasse hinab und erwachte. (362 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0755 (1951-12-19 - Freiburg)Ich bin Maler. Als ich in mein Atelier zurückkomme, finde ich dort eine Menge von Menschen -- betrachtend -- von denen einer sich über ein umgefallenes Bild lehnt und es dabei verbiegt. Ich herrsche ihn an, es zu lassen, und als er nur lahm reagiert, schmeisse ich ihn wütend raus und ebenfalls alle anderen, die murren. Peinliche Stille bleibt um mich zurück. Auf der Fensterbank steht eine Fülle blühender Blumen, darunter wunderbar rosa Azaleen. Nächstes Traumbild: Spielt bei meinen Geschwistern. Emmi packt mir ein Lebensmittelpaket, das mit einer grossen Dose voller Zucker beginnt. Nächste Szene handelt von Gogarten und Bach (die miteinander versippt sind). Um Bach herum hat ein Rennen stattgefunden, bei dem Fahrräder von Motorrädern gezogen werden. Alle gleiten dabei und stürzen. Nur einer kommt ins Ziel, und der muss sein Fahrrad schieben und blutet von einer Hautabschürfung. Ich habe zunächst das Rennen gesehen, dann es Bach erzählt, der zu Gogarten geht -- diesmal ist es aber offenbar so, dass Gogarten es war, um den herum das Rennen ging. (170 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0756 (1951-12-23 - Freiburg)Zuerst auf dem Lande (wie in Roggow oder Wittmoldt) zur Arbeit und gleichzeitig Erholung, in einer Art Pavillon, gleichzeitig wie ein Château oder eine Bibliothek, wo ich vor einer Wand alte Aufzeichnungen von mir, die zugleich meine Arbeit in einem sehr umständlichen Stil betreffen, entziffere und entschlüssele. Einer der Landleute kommt vorbei und meint, ich habe mich noch schlecht erholt, ich sei noch zu mager. Die Schrift ist an die Wand gekritztelt wie in einem Aussichtspavillon, die Texte sind aber gleichzeitig von der Art, wie man sie in Bibliotheken liest, betreffen aber eine praktische, recht tangierende Arbeit, die ich wohl an dem Tempelchen zu leisten habe. Andere Szene: Nicolai Hartmann zu Besuch: Ich gebe ihm im dunklen Raum, Zimmer, einige Pinsel, damit er etwas, einen Traum oder ähnliches, für mich aufzeichnen kann. Er sucht sorgfältig den feinsten Pinsel heraus und zeichnet dann mit einer grossen Sicherheit. Ich habe davon vor allem noch eine diagonale Linie auf einer rechteckigen Fläche in Erinnerung. Die ganze Zeichnung hatte etwas geistig Konstruktives und zugleich den Gegebenheiten des Traumes Angenähertes. Dann sieht er durch das Fenster Professor Gerstel hereinkommen und wir beschliessen darum fortzugehen, in seine Wohnung, da er wohl vor ihm zu zeichnen befangen ist. Er borgt sich einen Hut von mir. Ich gebe ihm alle meine Hüte, zumeist von Vater geerbte, zur Wahl, rate ihm aber einen dunkelblauen, sehr breitkrempigen, den ich ihm scherzhaft mit den Worten gebe: "Ich möchte doch mal sehen, wie der Ihnen steht." Der ist ihm aber viel zu weit und er sieht darunter aus wie eine Figur aus einem englischen Film. Wir probieren dann noch andere Hüte, und er ist in allem diesen sehr geduldig und gütig, zugleich in einer souveränen Heiterkeit über das Spiel erhaben. Der braune Hut meines Vaters zum Beispiel, der ursprünglich einmal für mich gekauft wurde, steht ihm genau so wenig wie meinem Vater, meinem Bruder oder mir. Doch schliesslich finden wir etwas Passendes. Dritte Szene. Ich beschaue Bücher, die mir ein Papier- oder Holz-Händler gebracht hat. Er verkauft die Dinger zum Heizen, aber an einen seiner Kunden, so an einen alten Einsiedler, von dem er erzählt, liefert er die Bücher auch zum Lesen. Ich blättere zunächst in einer alten griechischen und hebräischen Textausgabe, in der anscheinend auch die griechischen Textausgaben der Tragödien enthalten sind -- wie ich später feststelle eine Art Journal, in dem man Verschiedenes gesammelt hat. Dann ein Buch mit Bildern, Stichen, zum Teil koloriert, aus Heidelberg. Das Buch mag aus der Zeit um die Jahrhundertwende stammen. Ich wundere mich, dass die Bilder so viel Stil beweisen. Bilder der Stadt und Bilder aus dem Studentenleben. So sieht man in einem alten Haus mit hölzernen verschalten Wänden nachts einen jungen Studenten zu einem blonden Mädchen gehen, die ihm nackt, nur leicht einen Mantel umgeworfen, über eine kleine Treppe herab entgegenkommt und ihm die Hand reicht. Ich denke an Marion, der das Mädchen gleicht, und wundere mich über die Ähnlichkeit in diesem alten Buch. (491 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0758 (1951-12-26 - Freiburg)Traumbilder: Eine Maske, mit leicht geöffnetem Mund. Wenn man sich ihr -- von oben sie betrachtend -- nähert, gibt es einen Moment, in dem sie plötzlich den Mund schliesst, doch so, dass nicht bei einer allmählichen Näherung die Öffnung des Mundes nur immer weniger zu sehen ist, bis sich die Lippen geschlossen zu haben scheinen, sondern so, dass in einem bestimmten Stadium, der Mund sich plötzlich und wie von der Maske ausgehend schliesst. Mich beschäftigt dieses Phänomen, das ich öfters wiederhole und auch einem anderen zeige. -- Zweites Traumbild: Ein Haus mit drei Balkonen übereinander, auf deren jedem eine trauernde Frau steht, bei deren Anblick -- von unten nach oben immer stärker werdend -- die Trauer in mir hochsteigt. Es ist ein Urbild der Trauer, in dessen Anblick ihr Vollzug liegt ohne Grund. Die Dreiheit und das Steigen des Blicks werden eine Einheit in dem Aufsteigen der Trauer, das in ihnen nicht mehr als Bild, sondern als es selbst verkörpert ist. -- Andere Traumszene: Ich sitze bei Marion -- und zwar neben ihr, auf dem Bettrand ihres Bruders. Sie ist erst zurück gekommen oder aufgewacht, und sagt zu mir: "Ich bitte dich, drei Monate nicht zu mir zu kommen." Da steigt die Trauer in mir hoch. (Doch ist dies Traumbild ein nachkommendes -- nicht dem Bild der Trauer -- oben -- vorausgehendes.) Andere Traumszene: Mein Bruder hat sich mit einer Fürstenberg befreundet. Wir stehen vor einem Bunker dieser Familie, der im Stil einer neuromanischen Kirche erbaut ist. Auch wird dort Gottesdienst abgehalten. Die Bewohner der Stadt finden dieses Bauwerk schön und lassen sich nicht belehren. (265 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0759 (1951-12-27 - Freiburg)Traum von Ricarda -- bis zu innigsten und leiblichen Vereinigung. (Es geschieht zum ersten Mal, dass ich von solchen Dingen unverstellt und ohne Bild geträumt habe). Schön war das Spiel mit den Schenkeln und Hüften und voll tiefen Einverständnisses, jenes Einverständnisses, das sich plötzlich nach anfänglichen Widerstand unserer bemächtigt. So war es beglückend, das hellbraune wollene Hemd von der Haut zu streifen, die es locker umschlossen hatte. Zunächst bewegten wir uns im Bereich des Gespräches, das sich jedoch plötzlich in Widerstände verstrickte, und als sie anfing, mich zu ärgern und zu hänseln, schwieg ich, obwohl die Trauer bis zum Halse in mir hochstieg, dann schlug ich ihr rechts und links eine Ohrfeige und darin leitete sich die Umarmung ein. Der Traum war begleitet von einem merkwürdigen Nachspiel: Als ich den Vorhang zurückschlug, sass dort Katharina Gerstel, die Malerin, die aus irgend einem Grunde wegen eines Zwistes, aus der elterlichen Wohnung fortgelaufen war und bei uns eine Zuflucht gesucht hatte. Sie war schweigend hinter dem Vorhang sitzen geblieben. Auch mein Bruder spielte in den Traum hinein, doch wohl in der vorausgegangen Szene, die mir nicht mehr erinnerlich ist. (187 words)

Dann eine Szene, in der Behm mit seiner Zungenspitze mein Ohrläppchen berührt, so dass mich durch den Körper ein tiefer Schauer überläuft. (131 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0761 (1951-12-30 - Frankfurt a.M.)Gespräche mit Elisabeth Baumgarten über Giselas Eltern, bei dem Elisabeth Baumgarten die Eltern gegen alles, das ich einwandte, verteidigte. So sagte ich, dass die Mutter vieles, um den Vater zu schonen, täte, dass der Vater von sich aus nie tun würde, und dass dadurch zuweilen ein Circulus vitiosus entstünde. Elisabeth Baumgarten fand das sehr natürlich und verteidigte vor allem die Mutter. Elisabeth Baumgarten ist von allen Menschen, die ich kenne, diejenige, der ich das sicherste und tiefste Urteil über Menschen zutraue. Auch in dem Traum dürfte sie diese Rolle spielen. Gestern begab ich mich auf Ikas Brief und meinen Traum hin auf die Reise. Gelangte dabei zunächst bis Frankfurt, wo ich bei Gisela Haas und Michel übernachtete. (Gisela Haas, meine Cousine). Wuppertal ist das Ziel meiner Reise, wo ich Ika besuchen und auch Gisela und ihre Eltern sehen will. (139 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0762 (1951-12-30 - Frankfurt a.M.)Ich wohne in Michels Haus, wo ich krank im Bett liege. Er besucht mich am Bett, zusammen mit einem Arzt, der die Züge von Elisabeth Baumgartens Vater trägt (von dem Gymnasialprofessor in Freiburg, von dem ich ein Bild bei ihr sah und über den ich viel von ihr hörte). Der Arzt zeigt mir in einem Notizbuch eine Art Rorschachtest, jedoch nur aus leuchtend roter Tinte, den er mit mir gemacht hat und in den er die Gestalten, die ich gedeutet habe, eingezeichnet hat. Es sind nackte Figuren im Stil Michelangelos. Ich kann mich zunächst nicht erinnern, vor allem nicht an etwas, das ich auch in seiner Zeichnung nicht wiedererkenne, wohl eine Mädchengestalt, denn ich erkenne die Haare. Später blättere ich heimlich in dem Buch zurück auf die Deutungen anderer Patienten. Es sind primitive Gestalten (im Stile der Negerplastiken, die ich in Volksdorf im Hause von Maetzels sah). Andere Szene: Ein Spaziergang mit Emmi auf der Strasse: Wir überholen den Psychotherapeuten Rommelsbacher und einige andere, die über den Pfister-Test (Farbpyramidentest nach Heiss) sprechen. Ich höre im Vorbeigehen gerade das Bruchstück eines Satzes: "...viel Violett..". Emmi, die zwischen mir und dem Therapeuten geht, wechselt bei diesem Satz auf meine andere Seite über. Ich sage: "...merkwürdig, wo Du doch gerade so viel Violett gelegt hast!" (Anmerkung: Ich habe mit Emmi nie diesen Test gemacht). Andere Szene: Ich wasche mich in meinem Zimmer in Michels Haus vor dem offenen Fenster. Zudringliche Leute kommen herein, um die Glyzinie am Haus zu pflücken. (247 words)

Ich ziehe die Beine hoch und es beleckt meine Unterschenkel. Dann kommt eine Polizeikommission und sucht nach dem Reiter.

Ikas Bewegungen waren von einer besonderen Kraft des Zupackens und ihre Augen hatten eine fast zerschneidende Leuchtkraft. Die Beckerin schmeckte wie Ricarda und küsste wie eine sich Betrinkende.

Man sieht ihn mitten in der Fahrt innehalten, einen Moment wie unbeweglich stehen und dann fast steif auf den Rücken fallen. Er ist wohl tot. Ich lasse die anderen sich ihm zuerst nähern, weil mir der Anblick furchtbar ist, und kehre sofort um, um einen Arzt zu holen. Einmal scheint es, als ich mich umblicke, als ob er sich aufrichte.

Dabei hatte ich folgendes Traumbild im Halbschlaf (Wir hatten Champagner getrunken und ich erzählte es als Märchen): Ich grabe mit einem Spaten nach einem Schatz und zwar der Schwerkraft des Spatens folgend.

Andere Szene: Besuch in einem fremden Hause (ähnlich Wittmoldt). Ich überschwemme beim Waschen den Fussboden, so dass ich ein Durchlecken des Wassers fürchten muss, das sich sofort in zwei Richtungen schnell fliessend ausbreitet. Ich laufe mit schon entblösstem Oberkörper über den Flur, um den Feudel zu holen, und beginne aufzuwischen. Dabei wandelt sich die Szene: Die Fläche, auf der ich wische, ist beschrieben mit dem Offizierspatent meines Vaters (oder einer ähnlichen Schrift). Statt des Auftrocknens ist es eine radierende Bewegung. Das so Ausgelöschte will ich nachher wieder hinschreiben, doch plötzlich fällt mir ein, dass ich den Text nicht auswendig gelernt habe. Auch setze ich mir eine Grenze, bis zu der ich nur wischen will -- so wie man beim Puddingessen zuweilen die Felder einteilt oder beim Rasieren methodisch vorgeht. Hiernach kommt erst die Szene mit dem Assistenten, doch so, dass noch Strassenträume dazwischen liegen, in denen es, glaube ich, um die Wohnung eines Philosophen, wohl die Gestalt Heideggers geht.

Später eine andere Szene. Zwei Schäferhunde, von denen der eine ihr gehört, der andere irgend einem Fremden. Die Hunde werden aufeinander aufmerksam und schiessen, als der Fremde seinen loslässt, aufeinander los. Doch verhindert Ina die Begegnung, indem sie im letzten Moment ihren Hund mit dem Bein in die Luft hebt, so dass der ganze Hund mit seinem Leib auf ihrem waagerecht erhobenen Schienbein ruht und nur die vier Hundebeine herunterhängen. Der andere Hund saust darunter durch. -- Dann ein Taschenbuch meines Vaters, in das er in einer Art Personalienverzeichnis über Ina geschrieben hat: Sie ist gross, braun, mit brauner Baskenmütze, zu Intrigen unfähig.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0783 (1952-01-25 - Freiburg)Ich erhalte einen Musterungsbefehl, ausgestellt von einer polizeilichen Behörde, gehe aber nicht hin, da ich diese nicht, und im Augenblick überhaupt keine, zum Ausstellen solcher Befehle für berechtigt halte und in der Wiedereinführung der Wehrpflicht die Gefahr des Bürgerkrieges sehe. Andere Szene: Ich treffe die Beckerin, die aussieht, als ob sie schwanger wäre. Wir küssen uns, doch unterbricht sie eine engere Vereinigung: "Ich würde nichts anfangen, wozu wir jetzt nicht die Zeit haben, es zu Ende zu machen." Sie meint das ganz real. In dem Zimmer, in dem sie im Bett liegt, sind jetzt auch Mitglieder meiner Familie. Oben in einer zweiten Etage, die mit ihren Fenstern noch in den sehr hohen Raum hineinragt und mit einem einen Art Altar. In dieser oberen Etage sieht man die Gemusterten herauskommen und hereindrängen. Ich hatte eigentlich eine Karte schreiben wollen, dass ich dem Befehl nicht nachkommen würde, da ich ihn nicht für legitim ansehe, hatte das Schreiben aber unterlassen. Mein Bruder und meine Freunde fanden den Befehl so unbegründet, dass sie auch dies Schreiben für unnötig hielten. Mein Vater aber fragt enttäuscht: "Willst Du denn nicht Soldat werden?" und kann meine Gegengründe nicht verstehen. Dann eine Fahrt mit der Strassenbahn, zunächst mit meiner Cousine Dietlind, von der aber dann nur allgemein die Gestalt des blonden Mädchens übrigbleibt und die zugleich (wohl durch die Ähnlichkeit des Haarschnitts) wie eine Verwandlung von der Beckerin ins Blond erscheint. Die Strassenbahn fährt länger, als ich gedacht hatte, zwischen zwei Städten, nämlich zwischen Mannheim und Heidelberg und heisst O.L.G. Das Mädchen hat mein Fahrgeld bezahlt. Es sitzt über mir in einem Art Gebälk oder Dachstuhl. Die Bahn fährt sehr leicht und wiegend unter einem wunderbaren Viadukt dahin, das ich für ein altrömisches halte, zuweilen herrliche Ausblicke in eine etwas felsige verschneite Landschaft. Dann Ausstieg. Eintritt in eine Stadt, an deren Tor, etwas kitschig aufgemalt, in goldenen Buchstaben der Name Rostock steht -- ungefähr in der Wendung: "Nun aber doch Rostock". Man kommt sofort auf einen wunderbaren alten Klosterhof mit rötlichen Wänden, dann weiter in die Stadt hinein. In einem Heim oder einer Jugendherberge, zugleich öffentliches Rathaus oder ähnliches, in dem die Zugänge zu den verschiedenen Zimmern angezeigt sind, unter anderem auch zu Plato, treffe ich, wie in einer Herberge im Feldbett liegend, Ikas Bruder Ernst. Er ist nicht einverstanden mit meiner Rebellion gegen den Musterungsbefehl und versteht meine Gegengründe nicht. Schon die Gegenwart Platos in dieser Stadt weist aber auf geordnete Verhältnisse hin. Auf dem Hof des Gebäudes kommen mir viele neugebackene Soldaten entgegen, in feldgrauen Uniformen, fast alle bereits in silbernen Litzen und Sternen (Chargierte). Sie haben ihre alten Ränge aus dem letzten Kriege übernommen. Auf der Suche nach jemanden, dem ich mein Protestanliegen vorbringen kann, finde ich einen höflichen Mann, Kellner-artig im schwarzen Frack, der zu mir sagt: "Gehen Sie bitte dorthin auf Zimmer soundsoviel, dort können alle Studenten ihr Protestanliegen vorbringen".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0784 (1952-01-26 - Freiburg)Verwirrende Traumszenen, die ich lange bedachte. Es war schwer, sie in der Besinnung in ihre Reihenfolge zu ordnen, da die innere erregte Beteiligung noch zu stark war. Erste Szene handelt um eine Lehranalyse und spielt in einem Klinikgebiet. Es sind verschiedene Analytiker, weibliche und männliche, die als Analytiker in Frage kommen. Zunächst behandelt mich eine freundliche, aber wohl noch nicht sehr erfahrene junge Doktorin. Zuletzt ein Mann. Wir sprechen miteinander in einem kellerartigen Raum. Dann deutet er an, dass er mich nun untersuchen wolle -- anscheinend physisch. Ich solle doch einmal in die Klinik in die Station des Doktor Soundso gehen und mich auf ein Bett legen. Ich gehe in die Station durch eine Tür (Räumlichkeit wie in der Freiburger Nervenklinik, in der ich gestern einen Abort suchte, vor dem psychotherapeutischen Seminar, und ich hinterher mit Professor v. Hattingberg über die Möglichkeiten einer Lehranalyse, und wer sie machen könnte, sprach). In der Station liegt nur ein kleiner Junge, der mit dieses oder jenes Bett als frei bezeichnet. Doch immer, wenn wir näher zusehen, merken wir, dass es doch belegt ist (mit irgendwelchen Kleidungsstücken oder sonstigem von seinem Besitzer). Andere Szene: Ich trage eine kleine schwarze Katze auf dem Arm, die ich sehr liebe. Sie beisst mich ein wenig mit den kleinen Zähnchen im Spiel in den Finger. Ich liess schnell die Katze abspringen und ins Haus laufen. Auf einer Freitreppe, die wohl in ein Landschloss führte (ähnlich Roggow) sahen wir einen braun-gelben Hund herankommen, der die Katze hasste und ihr zu Leibe wollte. Der Hund wandte sich nun mir zu und biss mich in die Hand. Ich rief alle Leute auf der Treppe um Hilfe an, während ich langsam hinaufstieg, aber alle waren schweigend oder achselzuckend und halfen mir nicht, während der Hund fest meine Hand im Gebiss hielt -- dieser Vorgang war jedoch (wie immer in dieser Traumszene) nicht schmerzhaft, sondern nur von sehr grosser Angst begleitet. Andere Szene: In Roggow. Der Herr des Hauses trägt jedoch zugleich die Züge von Professor Gerstel, dem Bildhauer. Ich habe einen Brief von Christian v. Ferber bekommen, der in der Ostzone lebt. Der Herr des Hauses sagt, ich solle ihm nicht viel über die Zustände in Roggow schreiben. Er macht eine Art Geheimnis darum. Eine politische Bedrohlichkeit scheint im Spiel zu sein. Nächste Szene: Ich spiele jetzt Christians Rolle. Bin im Osten. Gehe in den Wald (auch er hatte mir in dem Brief, den ich vorher im Traum von ihm erhielt, von einem Spaziergang in den Wald geschrieben, doch schien er ganz sorglos zu sein, während ich jetzt Angst hatte. Rechts und links sah ich Häuser (Katen) im Wald.) So durfte ich die Situation noch für ungefährlich halten. Ein altmodisches Auto kam mir entgegen. Der Mann am Steuer erhob hinter dem Fenster eine Pistole gegen mich. Ich streckte den Zeigefinger gegen ihn, genau auf die Mündung seiner Pistole aus, und sah ihm scharf in die Augen, um ihn zu hypnotisieren. So konnte er nicht abdrücken. Dieser Zustand schien sich Minutenlang auszudehnen, und der Bann stand jeden Augenblick in Gefahr, zusammenzubrechen. Schliesslich gab der Mann es auf und fuhr mit dem Auto langsam weiter. In diesem Augenblick löste sich auch in mir der Bann, und ich bedrohte ihn wütend mit einem Nagel (einem grossen Mauernagel), den auch er schon vorher gegen mich erhoben hatte. Es kam zu einem Handgemenge. Hier schloss sich wohl eine Ringkampfszene an, die mich in ihrer Eleganz beglückte. Ich bekam darin jene Griffe demonstriert, in denen man zunächst den Anderen die Überhand bekommen lässt, um ihn dann in einem grossen Salto auf den Rücken zu werfen. Ich genoss den Flug dieses Saltos und die Exaktheit und Zügigkeit der körperlichen Berührung. (611 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0785 (1952-01-27 - Freiburg)Morgens Traum von einer Fahrt durch Breisach. Die Stadt lag in diesem Traum direkter am Kaiserstuhl, als am Tage und überragte mit ihren Dächern dessen Gipfel. Freiburg war in der Ferne zu sehen. Aus dem Rückfenster des fahrenden Zuges oder Strassenwagens (vielleicht Ähnlichkeit mit der Schwebebahn in Wuppertal) sah ich auf dies zauberhaft unwirkliche Panorama so herab, dass ich zuweilen dachte, dies alles sei nur ein Film. Die Veränderung der Landschaft war so, wie sie auf den phantastischen Landschaftsbildern und Architekturen Altorfers vor sich gegangen ist. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0786 (1952-01-28 - Freiburg)Traumszenen, in denen die Farben grün-weiss-gelb eine Rolle spielten. Später eine Perlenkette oder eigentlich mehrere. Mein Vater und mein Grossvater kamen herein und nahmen aus einer Schublade neben dem Bett jeder eine Perlenkette an sich. Ich sagte, ist es denn schon nötig zu fliehen? (Krieg). Mein Vater antwortete: "Die Leute fliehen allenthalben." Doch schien er nicht viel von der Flucht zu erwarten. Eine dritte, kleinere Perlenkette schloss er mir um den Arm. Ich blieb in der Wärme meines Bettes liegen und betastete selig die Perlen. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0787 (1952-01-30 - Freiburg)Erste Szene spielt in einer Zeit, in der ich mit meinem Bruder zusammen wohne. Wir liegen schon in unseren Betten, die an zwei verschiedenen Wänden im rechten Winkel zueinander stehen. Er wünscht, dass die Vorhänge geschlossen werden, doch sagt dies -- halb in seinem Bette aufgerichtet -- in einer Weise, die mich zum Widerspruch reizt. Gleichzeitig habe ich auf meinem Bett ein Schloss liegen, mit dem man, nach der Weise eines Fahrradschlosses durch verschiedene Einstellungen des Schlüssels das Gewicht der Decke regulieren kann, die dann drückend schwer oder federleicht wird. Ich geniesse diese elegante Einrichtung. Schliesslich schliesse ich die leichten grünen Fenstervorhänge, die in kleinen Rollen auf einer Schiene gleiten, und lege mich wieder. Szenenwechsel. Aus dem Raum, in dem ich liege, ist eine grosse Turnhalle geworden. Chinesen (oder Japaner) stürmen hinein mit vielen grossen Bällen in den Armen und über dem Kopf getragen. Ich fürchte, sie wollen hier ein Spiel beginnen und bin ärgerlich über die Störung, doch bemerke ich bald, dass sie die Bälle nur ablegen und überhaupt eine sehr leises und diszipliniertes Auftreten haben. Auch japanische Mädchen kommen herein in weiten wehenden Mänteln. Eine der Figuren fällt mir besonders auf: Ihr Mantel, glockenförmig um sie fallend, ist von schwarz-weiss geschecktem Leopardenfell. Ich bin inzwischen aufgestanden und beginne mich anzukleiden. Die Japanerinnen bewundern den Europäer mit den flüsternden Worten: "Oh, wie sauber ist der." Ich bin zunächst über diesen Vergleich erstaunt, merke dann aber, dass die Asiaten in ihren schwarzen Haaren und ihrer gelblichen und braunen Haut alle etwas erdhaftes haben. Auch die Frauen sind in ihren weiten schwingenden Mänteln wie schöne Tiere, doch kann ich den Eindruck verstehen, den das Europäische auf sie macht, das aus einer anderen Sphäre kommt. Im Grunde ist es der Eindruck der Zivilisation, der sie beglückt. Eines der Mädchen mit aufgesteckten Haaren und in einem weissen chinesischen Gewand kommt zu mir heran und bringt mir die Bruchstücke meines Schlosses, mit dem ich das Gewicht der Decke regulieren konnte. Ich bin etwas erstaunt, wie sie mir die Teile in die Hand legt, nehme sie aber wie selbstverständlich entgegen. Sie trägt mir nun eine Bestellung in Deutschland auf, für die sie eine umständliche Reisebeschreibung mit Angaben der Eisenbahnlinie und --stationen unternimmt. Die Verständigung fällt uns schwer in den verschiedenen Sprachen. In einer etwas gewandelten Szene, die aber noch in derselben Räumlichkeit und bei entfernter Anwesenheit der Japaner spielt, habe ich eines der Mädchen, das einen Pagenschnitt trägt, auf dem Schoss und küsse ihr den Hals.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0788 (1952-01-31 - Freiburg)Heute Morgen Traum von Hf., Kottmeier und Christian Ferber. Ich erinnere nur noch, dass wir zusammen irgendwie am einer Wand hochkrochen oder uns an sie duckten, an ihr bargen. (29 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0789 (1952-02-01 - Freiburg)Heiss spielt Klavier, und zwar moderne Jazzmusik mit grosser Eleganz und trifft zugleich mit wenigen Worten die Theorie der Sache, ohne sich durch irgendwelche Vormeinungen stören zu lassen. Er hat oben auf dem Flügel eine zweite kleine Tastatur stehen (die im Grunde den Klötzchen gleicht, die man beim Anschlagspiel der Saiten sich heben und sich senken sieht, wenn ein Flügel geöffnet ist). Diese Tastatur handhabt er mit solcher Leichtigkeit, wie man sie sonst bei dem Spiel dieser Klötzchen sieht. Später schaltet einer seiner Adepten die Tastatur mit einer Orgel parallel und spielt sie selbst. Da ein Priester gegenwärtig ist und wir uns in einem kirchlichen Raum befinden, zum anderen ihm auch die Eleganz seines Meisters fehlt, scheinen mir die Grenzen überschritten. Andere Szene: Besuch von Plessner, der sehr liebenswürdig wirkt. Gang mit ihm in ein Seminar von Heiss. Auch seine Frau, ernst und bürgerlich (er hat in Wirklichkeit keine) ist mitgekommen. Nächste Szene: Gang mit Heiss durch einen Schwimmbad-artigen Raum (so wenigstens die Atmosphäre der Umgebung). Gespräch wohl über meine Arbeit. Er rät mir, mal allein mit seiner Frau zu sprechen, die eine starke Zuwendung -- auch körperlicher Art -- habe. Ich solle mich darüber nicht wundern, er habe nichts dagegen, nur wolle er in solchem Falle nicht die Speisen, die für mich gekocht seien, zu Ende essen und die Kleider zu Ende tragen. Mich beeindruckte die Grosszügigkeit solcher Regelung, ähnlich wie bei den Äusserungen über den Jazz (Es kann sein, dass die Seminarszene nicht zwischen diesen beiden Szenen, sondern an einer anderen Stelle im Traum gestanden hat). Nächste Szene: Hf., der wie ich Modell steht. Die Räumlichkeit ist noch ähnlich wie in der Szene mit Heiss. Auch war Hf. wohl schon bei Heissens letzten Worten zugegen. Hf. hat bereits das Podium bestiegen, singt aber, ehe er sich entkleidet, den Leuten noch etwas vor. Ich stehe hinter einer Glastür, durch die ich ihm zuzwinkere, und bereite mich ebenfalls für das Modellstehen vor. (322 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0790 (1952-02-02 - Freiburg)Ich sehe in einem modernen Film, der aufnahmetechnisch so gut ist, dass ich hell begeistert bin und zuweilen meine Begleiter neben mir aufmerksam darauf mache. So wird zum Beispiel ein Bergpanorama nicht so gezeigt, dass die einzelnen Berge und Bergzüge im Wandern der Kamera nebeneinander erscheinen, sondern die Kamera wird in einem grossen Bogen so geschwenkt, dass darin zugleich die Tiefe der Landschaft mit erscheint. Es ist, als ob diese kreisförmige Führung der Kamera mehr erschliesst wie eine einfach lineare. Die Bewegung der Optik verliert ihre Zufälligkeit und bekommt durch die vollendete Form der Kreislinie Ähnlichkeit mit einer geführten Tanzfigur, die zugleich in der Bewegung das Sichtbare erschliesst, indem sie Weite und Tiefe des Raumes verstehbar einander zuordnet. Der Film ist von einem ungarischen Regisseur. Andere Traumszenen: Abfahrt mit einer Strassenbahn. Die Haltestelle ist so angelegt, dass die Bahn zunächst bis zu ihr eine Weile steigen muss, dann aber kommt unmittelbar nach der Haltestelle ein Abhang, der so steil ist, dass das Gefälle schwebend überbrückt werden muss. Wir sehen gerade aus der entgegengesetzten Richtung einen so zur Schwebenbahn gewordenen Wagen entgegenkommen, der dann am Kopfe des Abhanges, bei der Haltestelle, elegant wieder in die Schienen einsetzt. Als Seil beim Schweben dient die Oberleitung, als Aufhängevorrichtung der Strombügel. Meine Begleiterin hat zunächst Angst, in eine solche schwebende Strassenbahn einzusteigen, während mir der Gedanke Genuss bereitet. Sie möchte indessen lieber den Abhang zu Fuss hinunter gehen und unten einsteigen. Dann kommt aber schon die Strassenbahn und wir steigen ein. Schon unten auf der tiefer gelegenen aber noch geneigten Ebene beginnt der Strom auszuschalten, doch nutzt der Fahrer das Gefälle aus, zieht nur die Bremsen soweit an, dass er mit ihnen den Wagen notfalls zum Stehen bringen kann, den er nun nicht mehr mit den Motor bremsen kann. Ich rechne mir aus, dass er so noch ein ganzes Stück fahren kann, denn es ist die Strecke am Faulen See (Schwerin), wo die Strassenbahn auf einem extra Grünstreifen neben der Strasse fahren kann, also nicht mit dem Verkehr in Konflikt gerät, und das Gefälle andauert. Mir imponiert diese Art, die Bewegung auszunutzen, und ich rechne mir aus, dass dann das Stück über den ansteigenden Paulshöherweg und durch den Rest der Strasse, in der wir wohnen, bis nach Hause (Elternhaus) nur noch kurz ist. Hier wechselt jedoch die Orientierung der Szene: Die Bahn fährt, immer noch dem Gefälle folgend, auf einer Asphaltstrasse und gerät nun mit dem Verkehr in Konflikt, da ein sehr kleines Auto (Hannomag), ein Strassenfloh, wie man zu sagen pflegt, seinen Motor nicht mehr abstellen kann und vor uns auf den Schienen fährt, doch langsamer als wir, die wir den Schwung der Schwerkraft haben. Im letzten Moment gelingt es ihm auszuweichen, doch gerät es dabei unter ein normales Auto, wohl einen Opel, der jedoch so hoch ist, dass es unversehrt unter der Karosserie stehen bleibt. Der Fahrer des Wagens hat sofort gestoppt und steigt wütend aus, auch der Fahrer des kleinen Wagens ist ausgestiegen -- die Szene ist hier allmählich wieder zum Film geworden -- zieht seinen kleinen Wagen unter dem grosse raus, nimmt ihn wie ein Spielzeugauto in die Hand, um ihn aufzuziehen und dann in der Richtung der Strasse abzuburren. Hier ist zugleich das Ende des Films, der in einer Freilichtaufführung gezeigt wird. Aus der Leinwand wird die Kulisse: Man sieht in die mit kleinen Lichtern besetzte abendliche Strasse hinein, die sich nach hinten verjüngt -- doch durch ein Verschieben der rechten Strassenseite, die Kulisse ist, stellt sich das Bild einer Freiburger Passage her, die den Raum des Freilichtkinos bildet. Die Kulissenwand wird dann noch einmal zurück geschoben, so dass das letzte Bild des Films wiederkehrt, und so gleichsam ein Changieren der Raumauffassung zwischen Spiel und Wirklichkeit erzeugt wird, das mir sehr imponiert. Andere Traumszenen: Vorne links ist eine Kasse, offenbar die Kinokasse, doch hier dient sie dem Verkauf von Bildern, Kunstreproduktionen. Ich betrachte einen solchen Stapel. Die Verkäuferin gesellt sich hinzu und will mir etwas verkaufen. Ich habe jedoch kein Geld bei mir und vertröste sie auf später. Die kleinen, Postkarten-grossen, Reproduktionen kosten 30 Pfennig, -- die grossen Bilder fünf Mark. Auf einem dieser Bilder sieht man eine Frau mit enthüllten Brüsten. Andere Traumszene: Ich gehe direkt am Ufer der See auf einer Promenade: Gelber Sand und Steinweg. Der Sturm schlägt die Wogen in mächtiger Brandung an die Quaimauer, über der sie mannshoch aufschäumen. Ich gehe so dicht an den Wogen an der sehr niedrigen Quaimauer, dass eine auch nur etwas grössere Woge mich überfluten würde. Dann sehe ich draussen in den Wellen ein Schiff -- und bin auf diesem Schiff. Dort ist ein Mädchen, das ich oft in der Mensa sehe und das mir wegen seiner derben und zugleich doch differenzierten und sehr urtümlichen Sinnlichkeit gefällt und mit dem ich einmal einige Worte wechselte. Ich setzte mich zu ihr und betaste ihre Brust, deren Sein zum Saugen mir besonders klar deutlich wird. Mich beglückt und erregt diese Einheit des Sinnvollen mit dem Leidenschaftlichen. Erwachen.

Dann bin auch ich wieder dort -- und nun auch Gisela, die sich in dieser Jungensschule wohler fühlt als im Lyceum. Sie läuft während des Sports nackt auf dem Schulhof herum. Andere Traumszene: Jemand hält eine Abiturrede über den Humanismus bei Goethe. Ich sage: "Merkwürdig, über dasselbe Thema habe ich meine Abiturrede gehalten." Szenenwechsel: Herr F. kommt herein, mit Bart, etwas existentialistisch. Er unterhält sich mit Emmi, die das Essen kocht, auf Plattdeutsch. Er ist am Dickdarm operiert worden. Ich kann nicht alles verstehen, was er sagt. Emmi flüstert mir zu, es wäre eine grosse Schmiererei gewesen. (121 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0793 (1952-02-05 - Freiburg)Gestern Abend während des Baumgarten-Seminars, als Kottmeier sein Referat hielt, begann ich leicht einzuschlafen und es kamen wieder dieselben Traumgestalten wie am Morgen aus dem Film vom vergangenen Abend, vor allem der Mann mit dem weissen Mantel, der Mörder. Plötzlich wurde ich wach -- so wie im richtigen Schlaf zuweilen man bei aufregenden Träumen aufwacht, als Kottmeier das Wort "Gegenstand" aussprach -- und beteiligte mich lebhaft an der sofort entstehenden Diskussion. - Zweiter Traum: Heute Morgen Traum vom Heidegger-Seminar. Heidegger liess sich die Studienbücher aller Teilnehmer geben, um etwas darin einzutragen. Meines gab er mir ungeöffnet zurück, ich solle in den nächsten Tagen kommen, er sei mit mir nicht zufrieden, ich könne am Seminar in Zukunft nicht mehr teilnehmen.

Während er noch dabei ist meinen Begleiter, der sich geschickt entzieht, ins Kreuzverhör zu nehmen, gehe ich langsam und unauffällig fort, durch den Schnee um eine grosse Kirche und überlege, ob ich nun in wenigen Sätzen fliehen soll, wofür wenig Chancen bestehen oder den Kontrolleur ins Vertrauen ziehen und überreden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0796 (1952-02-08 - Freiburg)Besuch bei einer Grossherzogin, einer sehr eigenen älteren Dame, mit der ich frühstücke. Dann Fahrt mit ihrem Hofstaat in der Strassenbahn. Es geht aus ihrem Wohnsitz durch eine schöne Landschaft in die Stadt hinein. Auf der Rückfahrt hat die Bahn mehrfach Betriebsstörungen (der Strom bleibt weg). Umsteigen in eine andere Strassenbahn. Die Szene ist jetzt so, dass diese Linie ins Elternhaus führt -- nur angedeutet: Schwerin. Ich stehe vorne in der Strassenbahn mit vielen jungen Mädchen, die sich eng an mich schmiegen und Schutz und Liebe suchen. Einmal sehe ich links auf einem roten Ziegeldach einen Radfahrer wie einen Seiltänzer oder Nachtwandler fahren. Später verlässt er das Dach, um schwebend über die Strassen hinweg ein anderes Haus zu erreichen. Hier bricht das Bild ab. Andere Szene: Emmi schneidet mir die Haare. Meine Schwester Adelheid tritt herzu, als die Haare gerade seitlich gekämmt sind, und will die eine Seite kurz, die andere Seite lang geschnitten haben, das sehe netter aus. Ich nehme jedoch den Rat nicht an, sondern lasse die Haare wie zuvor zurückkämmen und nur die unterste längere Schicht mit einem grossen Schnitt kürzen. Emmi schneidet mir dabei fast ins Ohrläppchen hinein. Erwachen in glücklicher und ausgeruhter Lage. (198 words)

Ich sprach sie aus dem Fenster einer unteren Etage, während sie oben auf einem gläsernen Balkon lag, der von unten durchsichtig war. Sie nannte mich mit dem Nachnamen, offenbar um ihrer Stellung als Schwester wegen, doch war ich geneigt, sie wie immer mit ihrem Vornamen Maria anzureden. (75 words)

Ich will auf die Insel Kaninchenwerder (im Schweriner See). Die Frage ist, zu welcher Dampferhaltestelle ich gehen soll (Zippendorf oder Stadtmitte). Ich gehe in Richtung Zippendorf. Es geht ums Milch holen. Elisabeth Baumgarten, die mir den Auftrag gegeben hat, spielt hinein. Auf der Insel ist ein alter Bauernhof -- rückwärtig, wenn man um die Insel herumgeht. Dort fliesst ein Rinnsal in den See. Schon als Kind, wie ich Elisabeth Baumgarten erzähle, haben wir dort Milch geholt -- als sie zweifelt, dass ich die Stelle finden würde. Das ganze Unternehmen hat etwas Geheimnisvolles. Auf dem Weg nach Zippendorf verirre ich mich jedoch am Eingang des Waldes, komme von dem Uferweg des grossen Sees nach rechts ab und sehe plötzlich den Faulen See -- von seinem Ende aus überschaubar, über ihm lauter Krähen. Andere Szene spielt um Kottmeier und Israel, wobei Israel die Rolle eines Art Psychotherapeuten für uns für uns spielt oder spielen will. (167 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0802 (1952-02-18 - Freiburg)Gisela, die zugleich Züge von Emmi und meiner Schwester trägt, hat ein Negerbaby, das sie mit aller Selbstverständlichkeit füttert und versorgt. Ich glaube ihr indessen nicht, dass es von ihr sei, da ich sie nicht schwanger gesehen habe. Aus einer Mitteilung im Radio, in der der Name des Kindes und seiner Schwester, ein englisch klingender Name, genannt wird, entnehme ich, dass es eine andere Mutter hat. Andere Szene: Besuch von zwei Engländerinnen. Sie sehen auf der Fensterbank Engelins Kopfplastik (Gipsabguss) stehen, die er von mir gemacht hat. Aus der Backen- und Nasengegend ist ein Stück abgebröckelt, das sie wieder ankleben wollen, wobei es noch mehr zu zerbrechen droht. Ich bitte sie, es zu lassen. In der Eile fallen mir nur französische Worte ein: "non, s'il vous plaît". Nächste Szene: Ich erzähle Gisela von einem Film, den ich dabei gleichzeitig sehe, in dem das Leben eines modernen Menschen dadurch karikiert ist, dass er von Behörde zu Behörde laufen muss -- doch in abstrakter Darstellung: Die Behörde, mit Schildern versehen, wie Torbögen in einem Krokettspielfeld. Die Langsamkeit des ganzen Vorgangs wird mit umgekehrten Vorzeichen dargestellt, wie ein Film im Zeitraffer, in dem er im Blitztempo von einer Behörde zur anderen gelangt, in jeder Schlange vorgelassen wird, und im Nu alles erledigt hat. Das Ganze erzähle ich als eine Szene aus dem Revuefilm "Pariser Nächte". Später sehen wir noch andere Filmtricks: Reklamen, bei denen Zuschauerraum und die Bühne, auf der die Leinwand hängt, durch raffinierte Beleuchtungseffekte mitspielen, illusionäres Licht, das durch Spiegelungen den Raum wie eine Fata Morgana auf der Leinwand mit erscheinen lässt. Auch orangefarbene Vorhänge. (264 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0804 (1952-02-20 - Freiburg)Es ist Krieg. Ich bin mit Ika an dem Grenzfluss zwischen Ostpreussen und Russland, wo sie in einem Haus mit ihren Eltern und Geschwistern wohnt. Wir stehen beide am Ufer des Flusses und betrachten die Kriegsschiffe auf ihm, zwei leichte deutsche Kreuzer in hellgrauer Farbe und feindliche Schiffe. Ika meint, sie würden wohl demnächst schiessen, aber wir brauchten nichts zu fürchten, sie schössen ja nur aufeinander. Dann entsteht plötzlich eine Bewegung. Einer der Kreuzer beginnt nach links fortzufahren. Kleine schwarze Schnellboote flitzen über den Strom. Am anderen Ufer sieht man fremde, englische Soldaten auftauchen. Unheimlich ist die Lautlosigkeit des ganzen Vorgangs, die um so stärker seinen zügigen Zusammenhang durchschauen lässt. Wir starren gespannt auf die Soldaten am anderen Ufer. Diese legen plötzlich auf uns an, da sie uns für ihnen gefährliche Beobachter halten müssen. Wir kehren ihnen den Rücken, was uns für sie gefahrlos macht, und begeben uns ins Haus, wo wir die nichtsahnenden Eltern auf die Ereignisse vorbereiten. Andere Szene: Ich beginne mit einem anderen Mädchen, das irgendwie von weiter rechts kommen muss, die Flucht, wobei wir zunächst durch den Flur des Hauses von Ikas Eltern und Familie hindurchgehen, leise die Türen öffnen und irgendwie den Hauch des Lebens und des Schlafes hinter nur angelehnten Seitentüren spüren. Andere Szene: Flucht -- jetzt wieder ohne das Mädchen -- zunächst auf Schiffen auf der Ostsee (von diesem Szenenteil habe ich nur eine sehr vage Erinnerung), dann in einem angehaltenen Auto auf der Uferstrasse, einer nicht sehr breiten Asphaltstrasse, die direkt am Rande der Ostsee entlang führt. Der Wagen, in dem ich mitfahre, gleicht einem der kleinen Volkswagen-Omnibuse, in denen man hoch sitzt und durch eine grosse Glasscheibe die ganze Landschaft überschaut. Dann Einzug in Lübeck. Sehr beglückend. Ich bewundere die alte Architektur, das Holstentor und alte Ruinen, die zum Teil romanische Züge haben, den Charakter einer Einfahrt (das Bild bestimmter Fassaden nach der ersten Zerstörung der Stadt Rostock scheint herein zu spielen). Andere Szene: in einem Lazarett, von dem aus die Entlassung vorzugehen scheint. Dort werden, glaube ich, die Haare geschnitten. Schleswig-Holstein scheint irgendwie hinein zu spielen, auf der anderen Seite in der Räumlichkeit der Schweriner Schlosshof. (356 words)

Inzwischen ging ich einmal, bei einem Halt bei einem Gasthaus, an einen Automaten, der uns sehr viele Kekspackungen und ähnliches auswarf, ohne dass wir Geld reintaten. Ich hatte ein etwas schlechtes Gewissen, genoss aber. Nach der Ankunft nahm mich Adenauer mit in sein Haus zu einer Debatte. Die SPD-Leute redeten sehr lebhaft, während er unbeweglich neben mir sass und zuhörte. Dieses Schweigen machte ihn mir sehr sympathisch. Schliesslich fiel der Hauptredner der SPD plötzlich hin . Ich war nun sehr erstaunt, wie behutsam und gütig sich Adenauer um ihn bemühte und ihn mit mir ins Badezimmer trug. Später erzählte ich den ganzen Vorfall als Anhalter-Erlebnis meinem Vater.

Eine unbeschreibliche Heiterkeit breitete sich von dieser Szene auf den ganzen Morgen aus und Stufe zu Stufe des Erwachens beschäftigte mich der Gedanke daran, wie sehr dies Wesen, das ich vorher im Wachen niemals sah, doch Leben war und alles andere als "Wunschbild" oder eine Illusion des Traums.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0807 (1952-02-22 - Freiburg)Andere Traumszenen gegen Morgen: Ein Vogel, der sehr dicht an mich herankommt, mir zulächelt und mich küssen will. Ich kneife indessen ein wenig die Augen, weil ich nicht sicher bin, ob er nicht doch im letzten Moment zuhacken wird. Bei dem ganzen Vorgang sitze ich in einem Fenster, das in einen grossen kubischen Raum hineinschaut, der einem Tierpsychologischen Institut angehört. Ein Mann mit einer Kamera scheint den Vorgang zu filmen. In einer anderen Szene ist auch der Direktor dieses Psychologischen Instituts gegenwärtig, der seine Assistenten anweist. Ich höre ihn sagen: Ich wünsche, dass auf jeden Anruf die Kamera sofort gegenwärtig ist, falls sie mit ihr umherfahren. Ein Assistent antwortet: "Zur Zeit ist das Telephon kaputt." Vor diesem allem und noch vor der Vogelszene folgende Traumszene: Ich bin Assistent in einem psychologischen Seminar, das sich "Seminar für Medizinische Psychologie" nennt. Während ich ein Telephongespräch führe, ist mir der Name meines Chefs entfallen, worüber man am anderen Ende der Leitung im "Psychologischen Seminar II", das ich angerufen habe, mich auslacht.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0808 (1952-02-23 - Freiburg)Einfahrt mit der Eisenbahn in eine zerstörte Stadt. Über Brücken und Flüsse hinweg (wie in Hamburg). Endlich sehe ich zwischen lauter Trümmern und Ruinen wieder ein Haus im Aufbau -- aber viel zu dicht an der Bahn -- ach so, das baut man aus den alten Trümmern wieder zusammen (weisser Stein). Ich gehe hinein und wundere mich, dass man die alten Putten wieder verwandt hat -- zum Teil noch abgestützt durch Holzstreben. An einer Stelle hat man die Putten einfach provisorisch über Kopf eingesetzt. Um aus dem Haus herauszukommen, muss ich gerade an dieser Stelle kriechen. Der Gang wird immer enger. Schliesslich sitze ich, den Kopf schon draussen, aber zwischen lauter Stacheldraht fest, der mich bei jeder Bewegung am Hals und am Kopf verletzen muss. Dann wohnt aber Gisela in dem Haus. Sie weiss ein Kellerfenster, wo man die Gitterstäbe einfach abdecken und dann heraussteigen kann. (146 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0809 (1952-02-25 - Freiburg)Traumszene: Ich habe Geburtstag. Unten flutet das Faschingsvolk über einen Balkon in das Haus hinein und will eine Führung haben. Oben sind in meinem Käfigstübchen Tante Lu und andere zu Besuch, die mir einen reizenden Geburtstagstisch aufgebaut haben. Irgend etwas, ein Geschenk, das in seinen Feldern quadratisch aufgeteilt ist, wird später mit Butter bekleckst und dadurch unleserlich. Andere Traumszene: Ein Mann mit Pferdewagen. Das Pferd wird wild, will durchgehen. Er steht hinten und zwiebelt es sehr brutal am Schwanz, bis es wieder ruhig ist. Dann setzt er sich auf den Bock und fährt ab, sich sehr gemütlich an sein Tier anlehnend. Beide sind jetzt ein Herz und eine Seele. Das Tier muss übrigens, was mir während des Traumes nicht aufgefallen ist, nicht vor, sondern hinter dem Wagen gegangen sein, denn sonst hätte er zuerst nicht frei hinter seinem Schwanz stehen können, nachher sich nicht so gemütlich an seine Schnauze anlehnen, was er direkt von vorne, jedoch auf seinem Kutschbock sitzend, tat. Ich kann das ganze Bild nicht mehr richtig rekonstruieren. Anscheinend war in der Bewegung des ganzen Fahrzeugs auch etwas wie die Selbstbewegung eines Autos, so dass das Pferd irgendwie gleichzeitig Mitfahrer war. Ich kann jedoch die Anschauung des ganzen Bildes nicht mehr bekommen, nur die Details. Andere Szene: Tanzende Paare. Mädchen mit weissen Röcken in weit geöffneter Stellung, Tänzer die ihr Glied wie einen Pfahl in sie hinein gerammt haben. Die Bewegung der Paare hatte etwas Schwebendes wie Segelboote, die Figuren wie Aufnahmen aus grossen Balletts, bei denen die Tänzerin in der Luft einen grossen Spagat macht. Das Ganze von ägyptischer Ruhe und Hingabe. (265 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0810 (1952-02-27 - Freiburg)Traumszenen: Spaziergang mit Ika durch Freiburg. Zweitens: Eine grosse Glocke, die im Durchgang eines Rathauses aufgehängt ist und die Passanten an den Kopf zu schlagen droht, weil sie sehr niedrig hängt. Sie ist der Form nach nicht rund, sondern etwas flach (wie eine Kuh-Schelle). Ich meine mich dunkel an eine Traumszene mit Giselas Vater zu erinnern, doch wollen mir Einzelheiten nicht einfallen. Es könnte ein Zusammenhang mit der Glockenszene durch die Assoziation zu einem Filmbild bestehen, in dem ich ihn die Glocke des Köngisberger Doms läuten sah, die man in Burg aufgehängt hat. -- Drittens: Ein Bild in einer Zeitung, die meinem Bruder gehört, auf dem man mehrere blonde Mädchen sieht, die wohl Kinder betreuen; eines dieser Mädchen sieht dem Haarschnitt und der Haltung nach ganz aus wie Marion. Ich komme zu dem Schluss, dass sie es sei. - Viertens: Dann Traum vom Erzbischof. Er will eine Vorlesung über den Spuk halten. Ich begleite ihn aus einer Kapelle, in der er eine Messe gehalten hat, einer Art Domkapelle, in seinem Kutschwagen. Er trägt ein weites Gewand (das genau dem gleicht, das ich in einem der vergangenen Faschingsfeste in der Kunstakademie und Musikhochschule getragen habe, nämlich Giselas Gardine, die ich mir weit um die Schultern warf, und die in der Tat an ein priesterliches Gewand erinnerte, zugleich durch ihren geblümten Stoff an etwas Chinesisches erinnerte.) Wir sprechen während der Fahrt über die Messe, die etwas zu lange gedauert hat, weil einer der Priester sich einmal in der Liturgie versprochen und auch zu langsam gelesen hat. Wir steigen dann aus, und während wir eine Treppe in einem grossen Gebäude hochsteigen, gibt er mir den Auftrag, etwas an einen Professor auszurichten, das ich nur schwer behalten kann, weil ich im Grunde auf diesem Gebiet dilettantisch bin. Auch weiss ich nicht, wie ich in diesem Brief an den Professor von dem Erzbischof reden soll, mit dem Titel Hochwürden und in der dritten Person oder anders. Wir verabschieden uns dann. Es gehen viele Treppen parallel in diesem Treppenhaus angeordnet wie die Orgelpfeifen, doch so, dass man oft nicht sehen kann, ob sie nach oben oder unten führen. So sehe ich den Erzbischof auf einer fortgehen, von der ich nicht weiss, ob sie ihn in die Tiefe oder nach oben führt.

Glücklicherweise ist der ehemalige Batteriechef noch anwesend, da ich noch nicht viel von der Sache verstehe. Einmal musste ich in Erledigung irgend eines Auftrages von meiner Truppe fort. Als ich zurückkomme, ist dort gerade ein grosse Musterung durch den General. Ich suche vergeblich meinen Haufen, den ich noch wenig kenne. Höre, wie der General sagt: "Ich zähle bis drei, dann muss jeder an seinem Platz stehen." Es gelingt mir im letzten Moment den richtigen Platz zu finden. Meine Leute sind nicht da, doch steht ein Tisch von ihnen da, wie ein Weihnachtstisch mit Kuchenresten. Die Leute offenbar im Einsatz. Ich bitte den General um Urlaub, um zu ihnen zu reiten. Andere Szene: Ein Hund "Flecki", der aber aussieht wie "Pfiffi", beisst einen kleinen schwarzen so lange, bis er tot ist. Ich höre den schwarzen Hund rufen: "Hör doch auf, du beisst mich ja tot". Aber Flock scheint taub zu sein. Ich stosse ihn mit dem Fuss, doch nichts hilft. Schliesslich liegt der schwarze Hund sterbend da. Flock zieht seine blutige Schnauze zurück, starr und schaut entsetzt ,was er angerichtet hat, aber doch voller Gier. Andere Szene: Radfahren mit Monsieur Mignot: Wir suchen eine Arbeit auf einem Gut am anderen Ufer des Schweriner Sees. Doch noch ehe wir die Stadt verlassen haben, wird es ihm zuviel, weil er vormittags schon per Anhalter in Frankfurt war. Die letzten Kurven durch die engen Gassen sind schwierig zu fahren, da überall die Menschen Glasgefässe auf den Strassen aufgestellt haben, die wie auf einem Rembrandt'schen Bild im Schatten kaum zu sehen, nur zu ahnen sind. Dritte Szene: Ein Faschingsfest, bei dem Gisela fast nackend auf einem Tisch liegt. Ich bin in meinen Gefühlen hin und her gerissen zwischen wildem Zupacken und stolzem Rückzug, weil mich ihre Worte kränken. In einer anderen Traumszene küsse ich sie, doch bin ich gehemmt, weil ein Mann dabei ist, der mich vorher mit einem anderen Mädchen sah, das ich auch liebe. (328 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0813 (1952-03-05 - Rötteln)[Schloss Rötteln am Rhein] Architekturtraum. Schwerin. Haltestelle der Strassenbahn in der Königstrasse bei der Schelfkirche, an der ausserdem noch der Name eines Stifts und der Name Roggow ausgerufen wird. Man sieht auf dem schön geformten Schelfplatz rechts das Stift, links das Schloss in gotischer Architektur mit einer grossen Kirche. Es wird mir gesagt, dass jetzt irgend etwas anderes in dem Schloss Roggow untergebracht sei. Ich sehe Licht in dem grossen Kirchenschiff, das eigentlich den Hauptteil des Schlosses einnimmt, und versuche, hereinzusehen, um zu entdecken, ob der Raum noch als Kirche dient und ich also hineingehen kann. Andere Szene: Liesel Hartmann und Ika, die mich beide lieben und darum beide traurig sind. Sie wohnen beide in einer grossen Scheune, an deren Rande Kammern ausgespart sind. Vor allem Ika wartet sehr. Ich will durch eine lukenartige Tür in die Scheune einsteigen. Doch drinnen steht B. mit einigen Komplizen und wirft mit grossen Steinbrocken nach mir. Ich drehe mich nicht um, da er mich dann sofort im Rücken getroffen hätte, sondern strecke nur die geöffnete Hand aus, an deren Innenfläche die Steine fast schmerzlos, von hypnotischer Kraft gebremst abprallen. Ich bin mir dieser Kraft bewusst und suche, mich auf sie zu konzentrieren. Schliesslich lasse ich mich in den Raum herabgleiten. Dies ist der gefährlichste Augenblick, denn in diesem Moment bin ich nicht voll in der Lage, die Steine abzuwehren. Auch Hf. ist im Raum, doch ohne mir helfen zu können. Ich wäre jetzt in der Lage, B. und seine Helfer zu überführen, doch lasse ich sie. Andere Szene spielt um das Abnehmen von Gardinen im Zuge des Ausräumens irgend einer Kammer in der selben Räumlichkeit. Ich kann wohl die Gardinen abnehmen und auch die Ringe, nicht aber die Schnüre, an denen sie hängen, weil sie mit diesen zugleich gezogen werden. Es ist ein kompliziertes Netz von Schnüren, das sich in einem Strang auch schräg unter der Decke hinzieht und an ein Leitungsnetz erinnert. Hf., der anscheinend selbst mit seinen Gardinen an der Sache beteiligt ist, berät mich. (330 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0823 (1952-03-14 - Bonn)Traum von Jörg Brena. Er begegnete mir auf der Strasse und erzählte mir, sehr leise sprechend, einen Traum, während wir in ein Geschäft reingingen, wo er etwas kaufte. Zuweilen musste ich ihm während dessen auf sein Geheiss seinen Kragen zurecht ziehen und an seinem Anzug etwas ordnen. Ich deutete ihm dann den Traum, in dem seine Mutter und, ich glaube, seine Freundin eine grosse Rolle spielten. Leider habe ich im Einzelnen den sehr fein differenzierten und gut deutbaren Traum vergessen. Ich weiss noch, dass es mir leicht fiel, ihn verstehbar zu machen, dass auch Tiere -- es kann sein, ein geflügeltes Pferd, darin eine Rolle spielten. Dann ging ich zu Mudding Schultz, in der Werderstrasse (Emmis Mutter), die krank war, und brachte ihr etwas zu essen. Ich hatte, als besonderen Leckerbissen, einen Teil meiner Traumsammlung, den ich früher einmal zerrissen hatte, auf süsses Papier abgeschrieben. Doch konnte ich mich schliesslich nicht davon trennen, da ich es wohl auch schade fand, dass Schriftwerk zu essen, und ausserdem fürchtete, Mudding, die eine starke Ateriosklerose hatte und bereits in einer fremden Phantasiewelt lebte, könne es zu falschen Zwecken gebrauchen. Ich fand in ihrer Stube schon verschiedene Mahlzeiten bereitet, zum Teil sehr hübsch garniert, auch mit Papierservietten, und hörte auch Geräusche -- offenbar von hilfreichen Nachbarn -- aus dem Nebenzimmer. Vor allem sah ich viele Pfannkuchen in einem Teller auf dem Tisch stehen. Ich sagte zu Mudding: "Du hast Pfannkuchen". Sie antwortete nichts verstehend und schelmisch lachend: "Pfannkuchen? Du Schlingel!" (246 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0824 (1952-03-16 - München)Träume vom Autofahren und Reiten. Erste Szene: Verlegung des amerikanischen Hauptquartiers von Heidelberg nach Wien. Unendliche Kolonnen breiter amerikanischer Wagen auf den Strassen, auch Panzer. Der deutsche Verkehr der Volkswagen und kleinen Modelle spielte sich auf kleinen und steilen Neben- und Umleitungsstrassen ab, auf denen oft ein Begegnen kaum möglich war und nur bei schwierigem Umfahren von Baumstämmen und Steinen. Ich war erstaunt, wie dies bei der Geschwindigkeit und dem Gefälle doch immer glückte, doch froh, dass ich nicht selber zu lenken brauchte. -- Andere Szene spielt um eine Art Verfolgung, wohl durch Russen, die ich einerseits sah, andererseits erzählt hörte und drittens selber erlebte. Schwierige Klettereien mit Treppen und Leitern. Plötzliches Springen und Entweichen in seitliche Haustüren. Entzug im letzten Augenblick durch immer neue Einfälle, Umdrehen eines Hebels, das wohl die Tür zu einem Kamin öffnete, und ähnliches. -- Drittens: Reitszene: Zunächst nur mit einem Freund zusammen, der Züge von Hf. trägt. Hier spielen die Russen noch hinein. Er hat eine Art Trabrennbahn gebaut durch ein Flussbett und über ein Sandsteingeröll. Die Russen gaben dazu die Erlaubnis. Dann reite ich selber. Galoppieren auf Pferden, die wie im Fluge den Kopf auf den Rücken zurücklegen, so dass er einem fast im Schoss liegt und die Nüstern des Tieres das Glied des Reiters berühren. Mein Begleiter sagt, als ich die Haltung der Tiere mit dem Zügel korrigieren will: "Lass ihm doch die Freude". Ich lerne allmählich, eine feine und spielende Macht über das Tier zu gewinnen, mit den Knien die richtigen Hilfen zu geben, mich mit den Oberschenkeln richtig festzuklemmen. Einmal bin ich erstaunt über das feine Reagieren auf eine Zügelbewegung, wie man sie bei durchgehenden Pferden macht. Später ist dann eine Begleiterin bei uns, deren Gegenwart mich unendlich beglückt. Einmal, als ich sie an den Schultern fassen will, entsteht die Gebärde des Mantel Ausziehens, dadurch dass das Pferd unter ihr weiter geht und sie sozusagen aus dem Kleidungsstück fortträgt. Wir brechen in ein herrliches Gelächter aus, da uns die Szene an eine Ulkzeichnung aus einem Reiterbuch erinnert. Überhaupt besass diese ganze Begegnung eine grosse Heiterkeit, und nach dem Erwachen bleiben mir die strahlenden Augen des Mädchens im Sinne, ohne dass ich verstehen kann, welchem Menschen sie gehören. Die schmale Gestalt hatte Züge von meiner Schwester und ihrer Tochter Sigrid. Dann auf einmal leuchtete mir ein, dass es die Augen von Spechts Freundin Dagmar in Bonn waren, die aber eine ganz andere Körperlichkeit hat. (403 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0826 (1952-03-18 - München)Ich komme nach Hause und finde mein Zimmer voller indischer Düfte, die Gisela mit einem ihrer Räucherstäbchen erzeugt hat, und einen Brief von Gisela auf meinem Bett liegen. Es sind aber noch andere Betten im Raum -- es muss ein Zimmer in Wittmoldt sein --, eines neben den meinen ist mir verständlich, es gehört einem Stubengenossen, ein drittes macht mich zunächst stutzig, zumal es eigentlich ein Kinderbett ist -- dann erfahre ich, dass es für einen weiteren Wittmoldter Bekannten, den Gottfried N., gedacht ist. (Dieser ist zwar jung, aber sehr lang.) Andere Szene: Ich gehe in die Schule. Mein Bruder und ich sind lange krank gewesen, und ich will die Lage für uns erforschen. Zunächst begegnet mir Herr Plate, vor dem ich eine gewisse Verlegenheit habe und der sehr höflich zu mir ist. Dann ein Schüler (den Zügen nach wohl eigentlich ein Mitstudent), der von "Eigo" Walter redet und, dass dieser gesagt habe, "die Uslars sind intelligent", ich habe aber nicht genau verstanden, ob "sehr" intelligent "nicht" intelligent, und folge darum dem Schüler, um ihn nochmal zu fragen, und werde dabei in ein Spiel auf dem Schulhof verwickelt. Der Schüler ging in eine Art Lehmgrube, in die die oben am Rande Stehenden Lehmbrocken auf die unten Stehenden hineinwarfen. Die Aufgabe der unten Stehenden, zu denen ich nun auch gehöre, ist es, den Brocken geschickt auszuweichen. Doch das Ausweichen wird mir bald über. Ich fasse den Flug der Brocken ins Auge, strecke die Hände aus, an deren Handtellern die Brocken leicht abprallen. Diese ruhige und konzentrierte Art der Abwehr befriedigt mich mehr als das Gejagtwerden und dauernde Springen. Andere Szene: Eine Strassenbahn mit drei Anhängern. Ich will nach Littenweiler mit einem Begleiter. Die Strassenbahn fährt nur alle zwanzig Minuten, die Szene des Abfahrtsplatzes entspricht jedoch dem Marienplatz in Schwerin, von wo die Linie Drei ins Elternhaus abging. Ich rate meinem Begleiter einen Lauf, da ich einen Wagen sich der seitab von der Verkehrsinsel gelegenen Haltestelle nähern sehe, auf dem ein Schild "E-Wagen" (in Freiburg = Einsatzwagen) steht. Dann beginnt die Bahn zu rangieren und sich der Verkehrsinsel zu nähern. Ich entdecke jetzt die drei Anhänger. Sie fährt auf einem extra kleinem Bahnsteig auf der Verkehrsinsel ein und ich höre, wie ausgerufen wird: "Alle Amerikaner bitte hierher kommen " - es ist nämlich so, dass die Strassenbahn in einen Vorort fährt, in dem irgendein Hauptquartier der Amerikaner oder ähnliches liegt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0827 (1952-03-19 - Freiburg)Traum von Gisela. Sie will mich besuchen. Die Szenerie gleicht der des Elternhauses in Schwerin vor 1938: Oben mein (unser) Zimmer, in der mittleren Etage die Familienwohnräume, zur Haustüre muss man eine Treppe hinab gehen und aufschliessen -- doch den Freiburger Verhältnissen glich, dass für die oberste Etage eine extra Klingel war. An dieser nun klingelte Gisela, während ich unten beschäftigt war. Ich konnte nicht gleich hinablaufen -- als ich an der Haustüre ankam, war Gisela bereits zornig im Weggehen begriffen. Sie trug nur einen schwarzen Büstenhalter, eine offenstehende schwarze Samtjacke und ihren dunkelbraunen russischen Rock, so dass sich die Haut des Körpers scharf gegen die schwarzen Stoffe abhob. Ihre Lippen waren tief dunkelrot geschminkt, das Gesicht hatte etwas weniger gefasstes als sonst, Weicheres und Fleischlicheres. (126 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0828 (1952-03-19 - Freiburg)Ein Haus, in dem ich wohne. Ein grosser gigantischer Bau, in dem oben irgendwo unterm Dach mein Käfig ist. Zuweilen bröckeln Teile von dem bombengeschädigten Haus ab. Dabei wird einmal mein Käfig so erschüttert, dass er zu bluten beginnt und das Gestänge aus rohem Holz mit hellrotem Blut bespritzt ist. Wenn man das Haus von aussen besieht, sieht man, dass eigentlich nur die oberen Etagen bewohnt sind, die über der Ruinenhaftigkeit der unteren schweben, zuweilen wie Erker frei in der Luft. Ganz oben geht eine Eisenbahnlinie hindurch, die in den oberen Stock wie in einen Hügel einschneidet. Schon das Vorbeigehen auf der Strasse an diesem Haus ist gefährlich, wegen der herabstürzenden Brocken. In diesem Haus, das zugleich eine Art Jugendherberge ist, wohnt auch meine Schwester mit Bekannten, darunter einem Arzt, mit denen ich zu Mittag speisen soll. Meine Schwester schickt mich aber aus dem Speisezimmer noch einmal zurück, weil ich noch meine Hose mit dem geflickten Knien anhabe (in die ich mir in Frankfurt beim Fallen ein Loch gerissen hatte). Ich solle die heile braune anziehen. Auf dem Wege zu meinem Käfig suche ich einen Abort. Ich finde aber nur Misthaufen hinter Verschlägen. Dann steige ich eine Treppe hoch und komme in das Terrain, wo die Eisenbahn in das Haus einschneidet. Der Gleiskörper ist mit Gittern gesichert. Blink-Lampen warnen wie bei unbewachten Bahnübergängen. In der Mitte des Hauses, auf dessen anderer Seite mein Käfig ist (es hat zwei Treppenhäuser), sind grosse Säle zu durchqueren. (244 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0829 (1952-03-21 - Freiburg)Vielerlei Traumszenen, die ich wohl im Einzelnen, aber nicht der Reihe nach behalten konnte. Eine Szene: Franzosen, wohl Pioniere, auf Fahrrädern in einer Kolonne unterwegs. Die beiden letzten tragen ein sehr langes Brett (hinter einander fahrend) und fahren dabei sehr schnell um eine Ecke. Das überstehende Ende des Brettes verstellt in der Drehung einem alten Mann, der auf seinem Fahrrad aus einer Seitenstrasse kommt, den Weg und zwingt ihn in eine andere Richtung. Er ergreift in seiner Angst das Brett, wird auf die Brüstung am Ufer eines Flusses zugetrieben, kann sich erst im letzten Moment entschliessen, loszulassen, und wird durch die Geschwindigkeit von seinem Rad herunter und im Salto Mortale über die Brüstung in den Fluss geschleudert. Die Franzosen kümmern sich nicht darum und fahren im selben Tempo weiter. Ich rufe ihnen nach: "Halt, halt", um die Schuldigen zur Rede zu stellen -- niemand kann sie halten. Dann laufe ich zur Böschung des Stromes. Ich sehe den Mann bereits wieder aus dem Wasser auftauchen mit erhobenen Armen unter einer Brücke, zu der die Brüstung gehörte, und sich dem Ufer nähern. Als ich ein wenig weiter, wo ich inzwischen stehe, die Böschung zum Fluss hinab klettern will, recken sich mir zwei nackte Mädchenarme entgegen, ganz leicht mit Wasser beperlt. Ich ziehe dann das ganze Mädchen zu mir heraus, das eine wunderbare, weiche Körperlichkeit hat. Sie trägt einen weiss-grauen Badeanzug, der wie der Körper in einen leicht feuchten Schleier gehüllt ist, und hat ein wenig die Züge von Ulli Baum, doch nur angedeutet und bei anderer Körperlichkeit. Ich schmiege das Mädchen an mich, und wir sprechen über den Fall des alten Mannes, der sich inzwischen wie fast leblos am Ufer ausruht. Andere Szene: Ich gehe mit einem Mädchen auf der Strasse. Ein winziger Stier, sozusagen ein Stierkalb, verstellt uns den Weg. Doch hat er schon beachtliche kleine Hörner. Ich starre dem Tier in die Augen, um es zu bannen, das den Kopf so weit hebt, dass unsere Blicke sich gerade noch im flachsten Winkel treffen, während das Mädchen Schutz suchen hinter mich tritt. Andere Szene: Ich fahre in einem Auto -- altes Modell, wie bei Benders Wagen -- auf den Gutshof von Rothspalk, der in der Tat viel schöner und weniger pedantisch geordnet ist, als ich gedacht und neulich in einem Gespräch mit meiner Schwester behauptet hatte. Ich gebe ihr darum jetzt in Gedanken Recht, während ich die Auffahrt zum Hof hinauffahre, zum ersten Mal in meinem Leben selber steuernd. Alles gelingt gut, doch vor der Wand des Hauses, weiss ich zwar, wie ich den Wagen zum Stoppen bringen kann -- indem ich auf die Fussbremse trete und die Handbremse anziehe -, doch nicht, wie ich den Motor abstellen soll. Da beide Bremsen den Wagen nicht ganz halten, bewegt er sich langsam aber sicher auf die Hauswand zu -- ich bedenke schon, den Arm auszustrecken, um in so mit der Kraft des Armes von einem Aufprall abzuhalten, denn ich weiss, dass schon bei geringer Geschwindigkeit ein Anprall schwere Zerstörung hervorrufen kann. Allerlei Mönche gehen vorbei, ohne mir helfen zu können. Dann bricht die Szene irgendwie ab. Später, in einem Gespräch sage ich zu meinem Begleiter: "Jetzt weiss ich, wie ich den Motor hätte abstellen können. Ich hätte die Gangschaltung auf Null schalten müssen und den Schlüssel abziehen." Andere Szene: Eine Bulldogge will mir zu Leibe am Eingang zu einem ländlichen Gebäude, wohl eine Art Scheune. Ich versuche, sie mit den Augen zu bannen. Schliesslich gelingt es mir, durch einen ausgestreckt zeigenden Arm sie zum Fortgehen zu zwingen, und durch eine grosse Seitentüre zu entwischen, die ich dann gerade noch schliessen kann, doch hat der Hund ein Loch in halber Höhe in der Wand gefunden, durch das er sofort wieder hineinspringt. Andere Szene: Ähnlich: Ich liege. Jenseits der Wand sind Katzen, die plötzlich in Massen durch die Wand kriechen und mit ihren Krallen mit mir spielen wollen. Andere Szene: Treffe Krischan bei meinem Bruder. Da dieser aber immerzu erzählt, kommen wir kaum dazu, ein Wort zu wechseln. (664 words)

Dann legte ich mich angezogen auf mein Bett und träumte von einem Opal, der in einer rubensschen Farbe leuchtete und dessen Hellerwerden der Wille zu mehr Macht im Willen zur Macht war. (59 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0832 (1952-03-23 - Freiburg)Ich esse ein Ei, wohl ein Spiegelei, in dem ein hartes Stück drin ist. Eine Nonne, die wie eine Kindergartentante oder die Kochschwester in der Mensa ist, sagt zu mir: "Das kann man nicht mitessen, das ist vom Puter" Ich begucke das Stück, das wie ein Pfannkuchenstück im Ei aussieht und, wenn man es mit dem Löffel betastet, durchaus essbar scheint, und sage: "Ich glaube das kann ich ruhig mitessen". Sie guckt mich gross und verständig an und sagt noch einmal: "Das kann man nicht essen, das ist vom Puter." Jetzt leuchtet mir ein, dass es irgend ein Hautfetzen sein muss, der bei der Befruchtung mit in das Ei gekommen ist, und dass man es wirklich nicht essen kann. Ich sage: "Nun habe ich es kapiert", zugleich überläuft mich ein kalter Schauder. Die Szene wechselt. Ich ziehe ein riesenhaftes Ei sozusagen aus dem Leib der Pute heraus. Es ist so sehr in den Leib eingepasst, dass es sozusagen birnenförmig ist. Die Schale ist ungeheuer dünn und porös rauh, und als ich das Ei hochhebe, zerplatzt es und, wie das Ganze hinabfällt, wenn man ein Ei in die Pfanne schlägt, fällt wiederum ein Ei mit Schale herab, ebenfalls riesengross, aber in richtiger ovaler Form ohne den Ansatz. Ich erhebe auch dieses, das ebenfalls eine sehr dünne Schale hat und zerplatzt, und nun fällt der essbare Teil herab, dessen riesenhafte Masse, Eiweiss und Eigelb, ich zu verzehren beginne, wobei mir allmählich schlecht wird. Der Zusammenhang mit den Fetzen, den ich im ersten Ei fand, und der Doppelschaligkeit wurde mir sofort klar. Ich bin während des Essens zuletzt in einer Art Wohnwagen, der in einem Garten steht, an dessen Rande ein Wall, auf dem ich gackernde Hühner und einen Puter sehe. In dem Garten sitzt meine Cousine Gerda an einem Tisch unter einem Baum und flickt etwas für mich, obwohl es regnet. Sie sagt, sie sässe gerne da, denn drinnen wäre Besuch, und sie wäre lieber allein und hier in den Regen würde ihr gewiss niemand folgen. Andere Szene: Anhalterfahren. Zunächst in einem Autobus, dann hat mir jemand ein altes Auto geschenkt, im Typ wie Benders Wagen. Obwohl ich gar nicht fahren kann, fahre ich damit einfach los, und es gelingt mir gut. An einem Strassenteil, auf dem die eine Seite der Fahrbahn wegen Bauarbeiten abgesperrt und der Verkehr sehr eng ist, versuche ich rechts herum über einen Platz auszuweichen, sehe aber schon beim Einfahren, dass das nicht zum Ziele führt, schlage eine elegante grosse Kurve und kann dann schräg auf die Verkehrsstrasse wieder einfahren, muss dabei über einen Mantel, der dort wie auf einem Tisch ausgebreitet liegt, hinwegfahren. Das Ganze gelingt mir gut. Ich sehe daran, dass ich das Fahren gelernt habe. Andere Szene: Bender hält eine Vorlesung über Pommer'sche Schlösser, bei der auch Heiss zuhört. Er erzählt von ihrer Bauart, dem Material ihres Steins, doch zuweilen kann er seine Handschrift nicht lesen, er ist schlecht vorbereitet. Ich finde es schade, gerade, wo Heiss zuhört. Andere Szene: Heiss leiht sich ein dickes Buch von mir, von einem Autor mit dem Namen Schmuggler, eine Erzählung, die irgendwie das selbe ist wie der Inhalt von Benders Vorlesung. Der Einband des Buches ist hell. Es liegt ein Zettel in dem Buch. (536 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0833 (1952-03-24 - Freiburg)Traum von Gisela. Auf einem Fest mit meinen Freunden, bei dem sie trunken war. Das zeigte sich, indem sich plötzlich ihre Bewegungen veränderten und ekstatisch wurden. Ich begleitete sie heraus, weil sie spucken musste -- durch einen langen Korridor ihrer elterlichen Wohnung, der dann um die Ecke bog und zum Badezimmer und den Schlafzimmern führte. Ihr Vater schenkte mir etwas, ein Paket Seife. Ich sah daran, dass er mich wieder aufgenommen hatte. (72 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0834 (1952-03-24 - Freiburg)Schwerer Nachmittagsschlaf. Solch ein Nachmittagsschlaf kann sein wie ein Becher schweren Rotweins. Durchzuckt von Blitzen und von Farbigkeit. Hier war ich einerseits bei meinem Vater, der schon krank war, und Emmi und meiner Schwester voller Traurigkeit. Emmi sah dabei aus wie aus den Bildern in der Akademie, die ich heute sah, wo ich wieder gemalt werde. Sie hatte Augen wie das Bild, das Frl. Dickreuter von mir und wie das, das sie von einer Frau gemacht hat. Überhaupt waren es die Farben und Linien ihrer Bilder, die den Traum durchwalteten. -- Gleichzeitig die Ereignisse meiner letzten Anhalterreise, die ich in den Pausen des Modellstehens meinem Onkel (Vaters Bruder) in einem Brief geschildert hatte. Überhaupt war ich Vagabund in dem Traum. Gleichzeitig ragte das Leben Trudels wie eine grosse unbekannte Landschaft in den Traum hinein, der sie erwartete. Die Verschlingung der Bezüge war vielfältig. Über meinem Bett hängt ein Bild meiner Mutter. Die Wand ist mit einem Holzgestänge (zur Bildung von Fächern) kassettenartig überzogen. In einem dieser Raumkassetten sozusagen hängt das Bild. In einem kurzen Einbruch des Tagesbildes in den Schlaf sah ich es zugleich verdoppelt in der nachbarlichen Kassette, doch in der Szene so, dass diese schräge, leicht geneigte Wand den waagerechten, etwas steigenden Boden bildete, über den ich hinwegtastete, um in ein Schiff zu kommen, meine in Wahrheit waagerechte Lage im Bett aber als aufgerichtet - in der Stellung des hastenden Läufers - empfunden wurde. Das ist eine Erscheinung, die charakteristisch ist für die Nachmittagsträume: wie die Bilder der Umwelt, die durch die Lider, oder ihr kurzes Aufschlagen hineindringen, eingewoben werden in den Traum, doch ohne Rücksicht auf oben und unten, senkrecht und waagerecht, das heisst auf die Schwerkraft. Die Traumszene war, dass ich vor einer Tür, durch die man, wie durch eine Sperre auf den Bahnsteig, im letzten Moment an das Ufer gelassen wurde, auf ein Schiff wartete. Das Schiff erschien schon -- andere hatten es über den Holzzaun gesehen. Man vergass, uns die Tür zu öffnen. Einer klingelte. Dann sprang sie auf. Ich war im Augenblick wie gelähmt, wie halb umnachtet -- riss die Augen auf -- sah die Bilder meiner Mutter und das Gestänge -- erkannte darin meine Welt und hastete wie ein Nachtwandler darüber hinweg, blitzschnell erfassend, wo ich hintreten durfte ohne etwas zu zerstören. -- Dann war, wohl auf dem Umweg über das Bild meiner Mutter -- mein Vater in das Bild einbezogen -- wohnend bei meiner Schwester. Ich auf der Reise -- als Vagabund -- nach Frankfurt (dahin sollte wohl das Schiff führen), wo aber nicht Ika, sondern Trudel war. (An Ika schrieb ich heute Morgen an der Akademie). -- Zugleich kehrte ich wieder zu Emmi und meiner Schwester zurück, obwohl ich mich von meinem Vater getrennt hatte -- aber nur, um dort zu übernachten. Bei meiner Rückkehr sah Emmi so traurig aus, wie eines der Bilder von heute Morgen. (477 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0837 (1952-03-27 - Freiburg)Traum von einem sehr intelligenten und sympathischen Russen, einem jungen Offizier, mit dem ich ein Stück des Weges ging. Er nannte mich "Dellev". Es war im Osten -- die Szene jedoch wie in Freiburg. Ich kam eine Strasse, die der Mozartstrasse glich, hinab und wollte geradeaus weitergehen (Schlossbergstrasse). Dann hörte ich aber, wie jemand einem Kleinmotorradfahrer, der dort hineinfuhr, nachrief: "Da dürfen Sie nicht fahren, Professor, sonst kommen Sie nicht nach Kassel." Ich sah russische Posten in der Strasse und wusste, dass die Russen dort ihr Hauptquartier hatten. So wäre der Mann nach Russland gekommen (deportiert). Ich bog also nach rechts ab (Karlsplatz), in der Absicht, die nächste Parallelstrasse (Herrenstrasse) zu gehen. -- Während ich auf dem Karlsplatz gehend in meinem westlichen Pass blätterte, bemerkt mich der junge Russe, spricht mich darauf an, und wir wechseln ein paar Worte, die ihn mir sympathisch machen. Dann bleiben wir von einem Baume stehen, an dem russische Strick- und Stickarbeiten ausgestellt sind, von denen mir einige in Material und Farbtönung besonders gut gefallen, was ich sage. Dann kommen andere Leute, die diese Dinge in überschwenglichen Tönen loben, nur um sich einzuschmeicheln. Ich merke, wie das auch dem Russen lächerlich erscheint. Wir sprechen dann noch einiges, dessen Inhalt ich leider vergass. (207 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0838 (1952-03-28 - Freiburg)Traum von Nicolai Hartmann. Ich traf ihn und seine Frau in tiefer Trauer. Wir, das heisst einige andere Seminarangehörige und ich, mussten sofort ins Nebenzimmer gehen. Hartmanns Frau war ganz in Schwarz gekleidet. Er konnte keinen Besuch ertragen. Dann kam er in das Nebenzimmer und hielt eine Abschieds- oder Erinnerungsrede, in der er sagte: "Die Theorie (theoria) ist das Wesen das Lebens." Dieser Satz ergriff mich tief, denn ich sah die Übereinstimmung mit dem, was Heidegger über Hegel sagt, von der Skepsis am Sein, als der Schau ins Sein des Seienden als des Erscheinens des Erscheinenden. Ich verstand den Satz Hartmanns in dem Traum in der ganzen Schwere und Bedeutsamkeit jeden Wortes, mit der die Sätze Heideggers zu lesen sind. So bedeutete der Satz nicht die Theorie im landläufigen Sinn und nicht das Leben im landläufigen Sinn, sondern theoria in jenem Ursinn, in dem das Sein im Schauen west und Leben in jenem Ursinn, in dem alles Seiende Leben ist. -- Dieses Verständnis des Satzes ist auch nicht nachträglich in den Traum hineingedeutet, sondern es war gerade das Kernstück des Traums, die bis zu Tränen führende Freude in der Einsicht der Übereinstimmung des Denkens, das aus diesem Satzes spricht, mit dem Denken Hegels und Nietzsches, wie es in den Holzwegen dargestellt wird. Ich habe in diesem Buch mit grosser und irgendwie beglückter Sammlung in den letzten Tagen gelesen. Anderes Traumbild: Ich sah ein aufgehängtes Wäschestück (wohl ein Handtuch, das von vielen Besitzern mit Buchstaben gezeichnet war, ausserdem mit ausgeschriebenen Namen: Nicolai Hartmann, Helmuth Plessner, Robert Heiss, Detlev v. Uslar). Der Zusammenhang kam mir vertraut vor. -- Dann eine Traumszene, in der ich bei Hartmanns zu Gast war. Liesels Platz am Tisch war frei, weil sie verreist war. Die Mutter sprach von ihr als ihrer Tochter. Ich sagte: "Ja - Liesel". Andere Traumszene: Ein Seminar bei Heiss. Es kommt auf einen Psychologen von auswärts die Rede, der aber als Gast anwesend ist und neben mir sitzt. Jemand, der das nicht weiss, fragt Heiss nach ihm und seiner Denk- und Arbeitsweise. Heiss antwortet verschmitzt, dabei ihn anschauend: "Er schafft das mit seinem glänzenden Gedächtnis, weniger mit seinem Verstehen, das ist er bei dem da -- mich anschauend --, wie heisst er doch, ich habe seinen Namen vergessen." Ich spüre genau, dass er mich meint, fühle mich aber doch irgendwie unsicher und kann den Kontakt nicht finden, um ihm meinen Namen zu nennen. (400 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0842 (1952-04-01 - Freiburg)Traum von zwei Mädchen, die erste war blond, weich und bergend, die andere schwarz und temperamentvoll, trug den Pullover direkt auf der nackten Haut. Wir wollten -- es waren Strassenzüge wie in Schwerin -- in eine etwas abgelegene Seitenstrasse (Baaderstrasse) und mussten dafür von der Hauptstrasse (Königstrasse) links abbiegen. Doch an der Ecke sollte ein Schutzmann stehen, der den Weg versperrt. So mussten wir schon vorher durch eine der seitlichen Gassen abbiegen, die über einen abgelegenen Markt führten (hinter dem Rathaus). Auf einen solchen Eingang achtend schlenderten wir durch die Strassen. Doch das Mädchen, das ganz der "Antje" vom Fasching glich (die auch ein samtenes Kostüm trug, das dort wo man beim Tanzen führt, den Rücken freigab) bog verschmitzt in einen Gang ein, der in Treppen zwischen Schaufenstern hinauf in obere Etagen führte, dann wurde das Ganze wie zu einer Achterbahn beim Zirkus, auf deren Sitzen wir schliesslich hoch und beinahe frei im Raum hockten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0847 (1952-04-10 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Indianern. Einer unter ihnen -- ich spiele seine Rolle -- hat von Europäern eine Axt erworben. Man sieht während der Szene einmal über einem Dachgiebel ein wolliges federartiges Zeug herüberkommen. Ich halte es zuerst für gefährlich, sehe dann aber, dass es ein Schmuck, wohl eines kultischen Spiels, ist. Ich höre dann, dass die anderen Indianer den einen wegen der Erwerbung der Axt jetzt vergöttern. Ich gehe in das Zelt des Stammesältesten und habe Angst, dass er um seine Stellung fürchten und mit mir kämpfen wird. Er tritt heraus mit einem Kuchenbrot in der Hand, um mir seine Gastfreundschaft anzubieten. Ich erkenne die Geste nicht sofort und fahre unwillkürlich mit der Hand an den Gürtel, in dem die Axt steckt. Er ist traurig ob dieser Gebärde und kehrt resigniert in sein Zelt zurück, um seine Waffe zu holen. Ich sage ihm, dass allein die Angst mein Motiv gewesen sei, und versuche, seine Trauer zu versöhnen. Andere Szene, die mir nur sehr bruchstückhaft in Erinnerung ist: Ich komme in einen Betrieb, in dem der Besitzer, mit dem ich verwandt oder bekannt bin, nicht viel zu sagen hat. Es ist ein gehöftartiger Gebäudekomplex. Auf der Strasse ist es dreckig. Weisser Abfall. Wir treten in die Tür in eine Art Wirtschaft. Dort herrscht eine Wirtschafterin, die macht, was sie will. Sie nimmt kaum Notiz von dem Besitzer und fragt mich: "Was wünschen Sie?" Ich antworte sehr bestimmt: "Ich wünsche einen Aufnehmer, einen Eimer und einen ihrer Gesellen." Sie gibt mir ein Mädchen, eine ihrer beiden Gesellinnen mit, die mir sehr gut gefällt. Wir gehen hinaus, finden aber die Pfütze nicht mehr. Bei näherem Zusehen erweist sich die Sache als eine komplizierte Einrichtung, bei der die Bewohner ihren Abfall durch ein trichterartiges Gebilde in einen Schacht werfen, der mit einem Strassenbau -- sozusagen einer unterirdischen Strasse -- zusammenhängt, in der die Dinge, auch das weisse Zeugs, das wir gesehen hatten, verschwinden. Ich kehre etwas bedripst wegen der Blamage zurück. Andere Traumszene: Ernüchterndes endloses Gespräch. Andere Szene: Ich erzähle Dolo, das Deckbett sei zu schwer gewesen. Ihre Antwort: "Wir schlafen immer unter solchen Deckbetten." Zuletzt: Traum von einer schwarz-rot-weiss-grün gezeichneten Schale, die Ika in der Hand hatte. Der Grund war von schwarzer Glasur, die rot-weiss-grüne Zeichnung stellte wohl Jagdszenen dar. Die Grundform war rechteckig. (380 words)

Anderes Traumstück: Bekanntschaft mit einer Familie und deren Tochter. Die verschiedenen Anlässe dieser Bekanntschaft, die ich vergessen habe, waren in dem Traum ausgeführt. Es spielte in beiden Traumszenen eine sehr freie und leibnahe Atmosphäre. So spielte das unbefangene und sehr lange Wasserlassen darin eine Rolle, das zugleich ein Beweis der Freiheit und der Kraft war. Die Wohnung der Familie irgendwie fahrzeugartig. Das Essen spielte ebenfalls eine grosse Rolle -- vor allem von Kuchen und Schokolade. Andere Traumszene: Vom Modellstehen. Während der Zeichenprofessor etwas an meiner Nase zeigen wollte, kam Prof. Köhler herein und sagte: "Nur nicht die Nase berühren, wissen Sie nicht, dass es dann eine Stupsnase gibt?" Ich dachte: Die armen Chinesen, dann können Sie ja gar keine Nasenküsse geben. (137 words)

Dann ein Buch, in dem über Nicolai Hartmann und seine Philosophie berichtet war und er gegen Heidegger herausgestrichen wurde. Dann vom Heidegger-Seminar. Ich ging an dem Raum vorbei, in dem er seine Seminare hält, sah einige der Teilnehmer herauskommen und ihn selbst drinnen stehen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0850 (1952-04-14 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Franz Schu. Der Gutsherr gab ihm völlige Narrenfreiheit, und er durfte sagen, was er wollte. So hatte er ein Schild geschrieben: "Wir arbeiten nicht hier, wir fahren nicht nach Kiel, wir spielen nur herum". Der Gutsherr hatte darunter geschrieben: "Entschuldigung und Freiheit" und seine Unterschrift. Er nahm, was auf ihn gemünzt war, mit Humor hin. Andere Szene: Zugleich Kunstakademie, Töpferei und Universität: Wie vor dem Modellstehen konnte ich eine Zeit lang mit Nichtstun verbringen, weil noch niemand von den Malern da war. Dann kamen diese und zugleich der Professor. Das war aber nicht ein Mal-Professor, sondern Professor Heiss, mein Doktorvater. Ich tat nun selbst sehr geschäftig, um zu tun, als ob wir schon lange an der Arbeit wären. Zuletzt rechnete ich Zettel zusammen in der Form eines Pfistertest-Formulars, auf denen aber vermerkt war, dass eine Kollegin wegen "innerer Zwistigkeiten in der Werkstatt" so und so viele nicht ausgerechnet hatte und mir das übergeben hatte. Die Meisterin (Monika Maetzel) fand diesen Vermerk albern. (164 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0851 (1952-04-15 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Gisela. Sie stand plötzlich hier vor der Dielentür auf der Terrasse vor dem Haus in ihrem Russenkleid. Dolo, obwohl sie sie nie gesehen hat, erkannte sie sofort und sagte: "Da ist ja Gisela". Gisela, die mit einem Begleiter im Motorradanzug über eine Karte gebeugt war, guckte auf mit einem etwas unwilligen Gesicht, wie: "Still doch, ich will doch etwas überraschen." Ich sagte zunächst: "Was machen wir nun," weil doch gerade Ika hier gewesen war und es nun sehr schwer sein würde, auch Gisela, die ja Feeli aus Göttingen kennt, bei Mölöchen einzuführen und hier übernachten zu lassen. -- Dolo sagte nur: "Und machst Du gar nichts?", weil ich noch immer auf der Diele stand und nicht gleich hinaus stürzte. Andere Traumszene: Spielt im Gebirge im Grenzgebiet. Es ist die Schweizer Grenze wie bei Tante Lu am Oberrhein (Rötteln), aber Berge und Panorama wie in Bayrischzell bei Adelheid, dicht an der österreichischen Grenze, Personen jedoch wie in Wittmoldt. Man sieht in das Nachbarland und seine Berge hinein. Die verschiedenen Menschen, Tante Jusi und Kaili und andere begeben sich in verschiedene Richtungen in das Nachbarland, die wir mit den Augen verfolgen. (191 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0853 (1952-04-16 - Wittmoldt)Autofahrt mit einem Jeep mit Werner Buchholz. Als es einen steilen Berg hinab geht, stellt er fest: "Unser linkes Hinterrad ist lose". Wir bereiten uns beide auf einen Unfall vor. Ich wundere mich nur, wie ruhig ich bin. Ich strecke nur die Beine und suche, mich zu entspannen. Wir sitzen merkwürdigerweise beide hinten. Er bringt den Wagen sehr langsam und vorsichtig am Strassenrand zum Stehen. Andere Szene: Fahrt im Flugzeug. Wir steigen steil auf, um über die Sturmsphäre zu kommen, die über Asien liegt, das wir am äussersten Ostzipfel Sibiriens berühren. Dann nach einer Fahrt, die mir sehr kurz erscheint, tauchen wir durch die Wolken hinab und haben eine leuchtende Landschaft unter uns, in der wir landen. Es ist die Stadt Charkow, in der wir spazieren gehen, und die, wie ich von den anderen erfahre, in Rumänien liegt. Ich lese viele deutsche Namen an den Türschildern, unter anderem den Namen von dem Knesebeck. Wir gingen auf eine Anhöhe, von der aus man einen wunderbaren Ausblick hatte auf einen blauen See oder die See. Ich fühlte mich sehr zu Hause -- auch durch die vielen Deutsch sprechenden dort. Andere Szene: Bei Maetzels. Herr Maetzel malt an einem Teppichentwurf, den er auf ein grosses Podium skizziert, das aus einfachen Treppen gezimmert im Zimmer steht. Zunächst hat er nur die Figur mit farbigen Linien angedeutet und die Farben mit Bleistift hineingeschrieben. Es gefällt mir sehr gut. Monika zeigt es mir. Später malt er mit wenigen, sehr schnell gezogenen Strichen auf eine Wandtafel mit Kreide eine Schlange, die in ihrer Gestalt im Carré gelagert zugleich irgendwie ein Haus darstellt. Es werden dann noch die Tropfen oder Bissen, die ihr aus dem Munde fallen, dargestellt durch Kreise im Wasser, das unter ihrem Kopfe ist. Ich ziehe diese Kreise mit der Kreide, sehr schnell erfassend, was Herr Maetzel will. Dann sitzen hinten in einem Türrahmen (der ganze Traum spielt in einer Art Diele) zwei Jungens, die Ika auch gut gefallen, und die dort irgendwie zur Familie gehören. Sie haben ganz lange, oben glatte und hinten wie ein Panzerhemd um den Kopf herum geflochtene Haare, die nur in einem schildförmigen Ausschnitt das Gesicht frei lassen, oben über der Stirn sind sie zum Pony geschnitten. Das Ganze wirkt wie Prinz Eisenherz im Kettenpanzer. Ich sitze bei ihnen, betrachte ihre Gesichter. Sie fragen mich, ob ich wisse, was auf die Tür zu Herrn Maetzels Atelier, die gegenüber von der Diele abgeht, gemalt sei. Ich sage: "Eine Töpferei" (wie in der Göttinger Töpferei) und auf die Seite: eine Palette. Im Erwachen denke ich, die Jungen könnten verkleidete Mädchen sein. (429 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0854 (1952-04-17 - Wittmoldt)Ich lag krank im Hause einer älteren, mir befreundeten Dame, die in ihrem Wesen Züge von der Baumgärtnerin trug, gleichzeitig aber etwas Gesetzteres, Ruhigeres, weniger Bewegliches, doch ebenso Vertrauliches an sich trug. In dem Wohnzimmer, in dem ich lag, hatten sich um meine Couch, wie es bei einer Krankheit ist, allerlei Dinge angesammelt, so eine kleine Kommode in der Mitte neben dem Bett, etwa in Hüfthöhe, auf der die Speisen abgestellt wurden und anderes. Ein männlicher Verwandter nun, der die pedantischen Züge von Heinz B. (einem angeheirateten Vetter) und zugleich ein wenig die geistigeren, aber ebenfalls etwas gespannten von B.M. (der Jurist ist) räumte mir alle diese Gegenstände weg, weil sie seine Ordnung störten, und wollte mich schliesslich in ein kaltes Zimmer irgendwo abseits legen. Ich schlug zuletzt mit einem Tuch im Kreise um mich, um ihn zu verscheuchen und klagte dann mein Leid der alten Dame, die es verstand. Andere Traumszene vom alten Herrn Maetzel, der ein winziges Auto hatte, so gross wie eine Sänfte, mit dem er sehr flink und wendig fuhr. Er öffnete dann die grossen weissen Türflügel des Eingangsportals seines Hauses (das ein wenig wie Schloss Rötteln wirkte, so, dass er sehr repräsentativ aussah) und freute sich daran. Letzte Szene spielt auf dem Klo. Es sind jeweils viele Becken zusammen, nicht durch Wände getrennt. Ich suche lange nach einem für sich abgeschlossenen, bis ich merke, dass auch F. auf einem in der Reihe sitzt und das humorvoll nimmt. (242 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0855 (1952-04-17 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Ika. Wir wollten zusammen in einer Badewanne baden gehen. Es war aber sehr schwierig, die Tür abzuschliessen, weil das Schloss klemmte. Als es uns schliesslich gelungen war, merkten wir, dass die Tür gar keine Scharniere hatte und aus ihrer anderen Seite einfach aufklappbar war. Dann entdeckten wir aber einen Kette, mit der man sie in dreiviertel Höhe an beiden Seiten festmachen konnte, wobei man die Kette quer über die Tür spannte. Nun konnte man aber die Tür um ihre Querachse drehen und so hineinschauen. Schliesslich entdeckten wir einen Vorhang, den man vorziehen konnte, der aber nicht richtig schloss. Da beschlossen wir, trotzdem zu baden. Andere Szene: Ika hatte Besuch von einem Gott oder Halbgott in menschlicher Gestalt, den sie aber wohl nicht als solchen erkannte. Der gab ihr eine grosse ovale silberne Münze mit einem Bild von barocker Prägung. Dieses silberne Stück wirkte als Heckmünze. Das Geld aller Menschen, das sie Ika brachten, vermehrte sich. Sie konnte so auch ihren Schuldnern helfen, wenn sie ihr das Geld zurück brachten, vermehrte es sich so, dass sie ihnen noch mehr gab. Doch war das alles in dem Traum nicht so verständlich. Man spürte nur etwas von einer geheimnisvollen Fruchtbarkeit. Andere Szene: War hier irgendwie eingesponnen. Giselas Vater, wohl in der Figur des Halbgottes, hat etwas mit der silbernen Münze und zugleich mit der Musik zu tun, die überhaupt zusammenhängen. Zuletzt spielte ich selber an einem Flügel.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0856 (1952-04-19 - Wittmoldt)Träume von Ika (die gestern hier ankam): Wir assen gemeinsam. Dann Bilder von ihr, die ich unter ihren Sachen fand. Das eine zeigt sie in einer Tanzstellung, wie ein Mädchen, das eine Katze tanzt. Sehr schön war die Linienführung des Bildes, die Verteilung von Licht und Schattenflächen, so das Licht auf dem Standbein, das eine gerade Linie bildet, darüber der Unterkörper in einer leicht geschwungen Biegung, die eine Hüfte nach aussen geschoben, der Oberkörper wieder aufgerichtet. -- Dann ein Bild, das Ika gemalt hat. Es zeigt ein Castell oder Bauwerk auf einem Bergzug am Rande des Meeres (es ist der stille Ozean, doch sieht man das Ganze vom Atlantik aus). Amerika muss dort eine schmale Landenge sein. Sie hat das Bild gut gemalt, so dass man das Meer jenseits des Bergzuges erkennt. Andere Traumszene: Karteneinkauf für ein Konzert. (138 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0857 (1952-04-21 - Wittmoldt)Traum vom Verpassen des Autobusses. Ich lief bis zur völligen Erschöpfung hinterher und holte den Wagen noch ein, der für mich wieder anhielt. Ich schnautzte den Fahrer an, der vorzeitig weg gefahren war. Emmi, die mit mir war, und nicht so schnell laufen konnte, blieb trotzig und bockig mitten auf der Strasse stehen, mit der Bedeutung: "Ich gehe nicht mehr weiter". (61 words)

Die alte Dame war sehr initiativreich und genial. Zuweilen liess sie ihren Oberkörper aus dem Bett heraus hängen, um Blut in den Kopf laufen zu lassen, was ihre Kräfte förderte. Die weisshaarige Gestalt war eine Verdichtung aus der blinden Sängerin in Freiburg, der Baumgärtnerin und der Stiefmutter, der Gutsherrin. Die Szene war eingebettet in Wohnungsträume. (72 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0859 (1952-04-23 - Wittmoldt)Traum von einem Besuch in Volksdorf. Ich sehe aus dem Fenster auf eine schöne Berglandschaft mit römischen Castellen.

Auf dem Fensterbrett liegt eine Tonspanne, auf der Ika mit wenigen Strichen das Bild dieser sehr gegliederten Landschaft eingeritzt hat. Der Raum, aus dessen Fenster ich die Landschaft sah, war ein Klosett, in das ich nach einer gemeinsamen Mahlzeit gegangen war. Ikas Stube lag weiter rechts. Vor dem Haus wurde ein Gebäude aus schweren Feldsteinen im Stil der Castelle errichtet. Ich konnte mir ausrechnen, das durch dieses Haus bald die Aussicht aus Ikas Fenster verbaut sein musste.

Er: "Nur selten habe ich einen Theologen "als" Philosophen genannt, noch seltener einen Philosophen "als" Philosophen in meinen Seminaren. Sie sind das ja nun von Beruf. Glauben Sie, dass jemand, der von der Philosophie des Aha-Erlebnisses spricht, überhaupt von etwas Philosophischem spricht?" -- Ich: "Ja, das glaube ich unbedingt, denn, was damit gemeint ist, das Einleuchten, ist etwas Hochphilosphisches." Er: "Von dem Einleuchten muss ich ihnen das zugeben. Aber die Redeweise vom Aha-Erlebnis ist unglücklich. " (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0863 (1952-04-23 - Wittmoldt)Ich bin in einem Haus einquartiert. Mit einem Mädchen zusammen in einer Stube. Nachts klopft es auf einmal furchtbar an der Tür. Sie steht schnell auf, um zu öffnen. Ich laufe hinterher. Da man nicht wissen kann, wer es ist, schalte ich in dem Moment, da sie öffnet, das Licht an, kann aber zunächst nichts sehen, da ich selbst geblendet bin. Der Fremde sagt, er sei der Sekretär von Willhelm Furtwängler gewesen. Dann hörte ich eine Stimme (wie eine Zeitungsunterschrift): "dass Furtwängler selbst zur selben Zeit mühsam in einem Neubau in einer Vorstadt von Berlin seine Sachen schleppen musste, sagte er nicht." -- Der Mann wurde in ein Zimmer gebracht. Während ich noch stand, kam ein anderer Untermieter vorbei und lächelte mir etwas verschmitzt zu. Da erst merkte ich, dass mein Glied aus dem geöffneten Schlitz der noch nicht fertig geschneiderten Hose heraushing. (143 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0864 (1952-04-25 - Wittmoldt)Traum von Hf. Er oder eine ähnliche Conceptgestalt hatte anscheinend etwas auf ein Concept von Nicolai Hartmann gekritzelt und stand nun vor einer Art Ehrengericht. Die ganze Sache war aber etwas undurchschaubar. Zeitweise scheint es auch die Gestalt Gogartens, und nicht die Gestalt Hartmanns gewesen zu sein, um die es ging. Seine naturwissenschaftlichen Kollegen machten sich bei der Gelegenheit über seine Theologie lustig: "Der muss ja auch erst die Hand auflegen, wenn es gehen soll." -- offenbar bezogen auf die liturgische Bewegung des Handauflegens. -- Schliesslich wurde der Delinquent dazu verurteilt, eine Flasche Schnaps zu stiften. Am Schluss sah ich dann irgendwo das besagte Concept liegen und stellte fest, dass es sich nur um ein von mir geschriebene Nachschrift eines Hartmann'schen Kollegs handelte. Anderer Traum: In einer neuen Universitätsstadt, wohl Hannover. Ich suche zunächst, mich in der Stadt und meiner Wohnung zurecht zu finden. Zum Beispiel untersuche ich auch den Zusammenhang der elektrischen Schnüre, die in dem Steckkontakt der Stube hängen. Dabei kriege ich einen Schlag. Von diesem Kribbeln wache ich auf. (172 words)

Ich gedenke an eine Universität in der Nähe zu gehen. Vorher schon geographische Träume und Traum von dem Leben in einer sehr reichen Familie. Sie zeigen mir mehrere ihrer Schlösser, die in Stilen in der Zeit von 1800, Empire und Klassizismus, gebaut sind. (95 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0868 (1952-04-27 - Wittmoldt)An der Schweizer Grenze. Ich überquere den Grenzfluss. Dann klettere ich auf einem Gerüst über einem Bahnkörper entlang. Auch durch winklige Strassen der Grenzstadt geht es. Dann plötzlich erfahre ich, dass die Grenze abends geschlossen wird und es schon zu spät ist, mit meiner Grenzkarte zurückzugehen. Aber vielleicht machen die Zollbeamten eine Ausnahme. Die Übergangsbrücke, die ich im Traum nicht sehe, sondern mir nur vorstelle, ist wie in Rötteln. Andere Traumszene: In der Schweiz, in einer fremden Stadt. Ich suche meine Mutter, die schon in die Stadt gegangen ist. Gehe von Geschäft zu Geschäft, wo wie sein könnte, auch in ein Reisebüro. -- Dann andere Szene. Im Kino. Ein Lustspielfilm. Ein kleiner weisshariger alter Mann kommt darin vor, der vegetarisch oder sonst irgendwie absonderlich lebt und davon allmählich bekehrt wird. Noch drei andere Personen schweben mir undeutlich in der Erinnerung vor, die zusammen mit ihm zwei komische alte Paare bilden. Zuletzt sieht man ihn von einem riesen Kuchenstück essen, das in einem aufgeschnittenen Kuchen auf einer sich drehenden Schale steht. Er nimmt es nicht herunter, sondern beisst jedes Mal herein, wenn er vorbei kommt. Am Schluss habe ich die Idee, man müsste die aus dem Kino herausgehenden Leute filmen. Dann habe ich eine Art Scheinwerfer, mit dem ich sie erhasche, und filme sie, listig um Pfeiler herum. Als der Vorsaal leer ist, kommen dann die Darsteller. Zuerst ein blauäugiger Jüngling.

Mölöchen gibt mir noch den Auftrag, den Hund seitwärts in einen Stall einzusperren und verschwindet dann durch eine Türe. Ich kann aber den Hund auf dem Hof hinter der halbhohen geschlossenen Zauntüre nicht mehr sehen, entdecke jedoch, als ich näher hinsehe, dort eine Ratte und ein anderes grösseres Tier, halb Ratte, halb Eichhörnchen mit ausgespanntem Schwanz. Alles ist sehr unheimlich, ich habe sofort den Tollwutverdacht. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0872 (1952-04-30 - Wittmoldt)In einer grossen Schule, die im Bau dem Hause Roggow glich, in der ich aushilfsweise Unterricht geben sollte. Ich gelangte zunächst durch schwierige Höfe, von denen einer wie ein Kirchplatz um eine gotische Kirche angelegt war, zu dem Gebäude hin und kletterte eine der beiden Treppen hoch, gelangte, durch den Saal, der in der Mitte die Korridore unterbrach, in den anderen Flügel, kletterte dann aber aufs Dach, wo ich mit Hf. Wiedersehen feierte. Wir sassen auf dem First und schauten hinab auf das Gelände, ein grosses Seegelände wie die Dardanellen (so wie man sie auf der Alexanderschlacht von Altdorfer sieht. -- Das war also aus den Höfen inzwischen geworden.) Wir sahen die Düsenjäger von einem Flugzeugträger aufsteigen und von einem Schlachtschiff abgeschossen werden. Einige flogen sehr dicht über uns hinweg, so dass man es am Kopfe spürte. Sie machten schöne Kurven in der Luft. -- Ich sass dort oben gemütlich und hatte keine Lust, Unterricht zu geben. Irgend etwas machte ich mir dort oben auch zu schaffen mit einem Spaten. Einmal verlor ich meinen Hut, der das schräge Dach hinabglitt und hinab zu stürzen drohte. Ich hatte furchtbare Angst, denn der Hut hätte mich unten verraten, wo ich mich doch für diese Zeit krank schreiben lassen wollte. Er fing sich aber an einem Mauerrand. Ein Arbeiter, der gerade durch die Luke hinaufkam, meinte: "Ach, der fällt nicht herab." Schliesslich stieg ich aber doch hinunter und suchte mir die Klasse, in der ich Unterricht geben sollte. Ich hatte zwei Stunden zu geben und überlegte schon, ob wir beide ohne Pause zusammenlegen sollte, wie bei zweistündigen Vorlesungen. Dann kam Hans Kurt. Aus ihm bestand die ganze Klasse. Wir setzten uns jeder in eine Bank, beziehungsweise auf deren Tisch, und sprachen über Mathematik. Hans Kurt sagte: "Hier soll ich Dich etwas fragen, ob Du wusstest, was das bedeutet." Bei Rebwinkel (in Weinstücken) steht da in dem Buch, unterscheidet man Ortswinkel und raumgerichtete Winkel, die man nicht miteinander verrechnen kann. Ich wusste zwar nichts von der Sache, verstand aber was gemeint war, zeichnete ihm zwei gleiche Winkel auf die Tafel: "Dieser hier, der in der Fläche der Tafel liegt, ist ein Ortswinkel, der andere aber geht mit seinem einen Schenkel aus der Fläche heraus (darum raumgerichtet), er erscheint nur flächig. Seine wirkliche Grösse ist darum nicht messbar." Als eine Stunde um war, kam jedoch ein zweites Mitglied der Klasse (ein junger Oertzen, den ich von früher kannte. Die Traumfigur sah dem Wittmoldter ähnlich). Er wusste nicht, dass ich Lehrer war, war gewohnt zu herrschen und begann aus einem Geschichtsbuch zu lesen und Jahreszahlen zu nennen. Ich liess ihn gewähren und tat, als ob alles in Ordnung sei, da ich sowieso nichts von Geschichte verstand. Er war mir aber nicht sympathisch. (456 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0873 (1952-05-01 - Wittmoldt)Während Muttis Krankheit kurz vor ihrem Tod. Ich bin an ihrem Bett und pflege sie. Wir verstehen uns gut und selbstverständlich. Dann kommt Vater. Er bemüht sich sehr, zu tun, als ob die Krankheit gar nicht schwer sei. Auf mich wirkt das verkrampft. Dann wird aus seiner Gestalt die Gestalt des Doktor Pohrt (seines Schulfreundes, der übrigens als Arzt Muttis Tod bestätigt hat 1939). Ich stehe mit ihm an der Tür. Es entsteht ein Gespräch, bei dem er sich in die Gestalt des Doktors Paal wandelt (Freund der Baumgärtnerin, Leibarzt des katholischen Erzbischofs von Freiburg). Er sagt: "Warum ist eigentlich die moderne Kunst ungegenständlich?" (diese Frage stellte neulich immer wieder hier die baltische Malerin Fräulein von der Ropp an mich -- während die Baumgärtnerin in Freiburg als Malerin dafür Verständnis hat). Ich antwortete: "Sie ist nicht ungegenständlich. Es ist nur Anderes, was in ihr in der Lichtung steht." Er sagte: "Ja -- aber ich liebe die erlesenen Gegenstände." Ich dachte: das ist katholisch, und sagte: "Das ist das Wesen des mittelalterlichen Menschen. Der moderne sucht die Gewissheit des Gegenstandes, und das ist auch in den Gegenständen dieser Bilder so (zum Beispiel der Nachbilder)." -- Jetzt wandelt sich die Gestalt von der des Doktor Paal in die von Professor Baumgarten. Er sagt: "Ja, damit haben Sie neulich auch meine Tochter behandeln wollen". (Ich hatte mich in einer vorhergehenden Traumszene mit ihr über moderne Kunst unterhalten). Er sagte es sehr vorwurfsvoll. Dann wandelte sich die Traumgestalt wieder in die Vaters, der wieder zu Mutti herein ging und etwas gezwungen heiter war. Als er wieder heraus war, ging ich wieder zu ihr, die jetzt die Züge von Spechts Mutter trug. Sie erzählte mir einen Traum und sagte: "Ich möchte wohl gerne wissen, was das bedeuten kann. Die erste Szene handelte von schwarzem Samt und vom Särge kaufen." Ich sagte: "Du beschäftigst Dich natürlich bei einer so langen Krankheit mit der Möglichkeit des Todes". Sie: "Ja, ich möchte nicht und glaube nicht (lächelnd), aber es ist natürlich doch eine Möglichkeit". (336 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0874 (1952-05-01 - Wittmoldt)Ein Traum von Marion, der schon Tage her ist und den ich damals gleich vergass, fiel mir heute morgen im Bett wieder ein. Sie war mit ihrem Bruder irgendwo in der Ostzone, wohl in Thüringen oder Sachsen, und ich wollte sie gern dort besuchen. Studierte lange die Landkarte. Später, glaube ich, wurde daraus der Traum vom Flug über Sibirien etc. (60 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0875 (1952-05-03 - Wittmoldt)Anhalter-Fahren. An einer Seitenstrasse fragte ich einen alten weisshaarigen Mann (mit einer Art Kyffhäuser-Mütze) um Auskunft. Er gab sehr freundlich Antwort. Später begegnete ich ihm noch einmal auf dem Fahrrad. Ich sagte ihm, dass ich in eine Nachbarortschaft wolle. Er geleitete mich durch die Stadt. Nahm mich dabei sozusagen schützend in seinen Arm. Ich glitt aus oder verlor das Gleichgewicht und berührte dabei mit meinem weissen Hemd den Boden, das dabei erdig wurde. Er suchte, mich zu halten, und sagte dabei unwillig: "Mein Herr, das bin ich nicht gewohnt". Dann wohnte ich in seinem Hause. Dort begegnete mir Marlies, die mir mit ihren wallenden blonden Haaren gefiel. Ich besuchte sie dort in ihrem Zimmer und wir küssten uns. Ich konnte mich aber nicht ganz hingeben, weil in ihrer Körperlichkeit mich irgend etwas störte. Morgens betrachtete die Frau des Hauses mich argwöhnisch, brachte mir indessen viel zu essen. Dann kam Tante Tabitha irgendwie herein. -- Der Pfister-Test und die violette Farbe spielten in dem Traum eine Rolle. Der Traum ging (wie mir jetzt wieder einfällt), dann noch weiter: In einem Raum des Hauses hingen sehr viele Zeichnungen, wohl von einem Sohn des Hauses, der offenbar in der Freiburger Kunstakademie gewesen war, denn die Portraitzeichnungen waren zum Teil nach mir gemacht. Ich erkannte sie an dem angedeuteten Winkelprofil und der Art des Blickes. Die Leute erkannten das aber nicht. Sie fanden die Zeichnungen scheusslich. Auch eine Plastik spielte eine Rolle.

Dann aber sah ich, wie es damit die Fischchen aus dem Magen des anderen hervorholte, die dieses gefressen hatte. Die Zunge war dafür vorne schmal wie eine lange Rute.

Ich wohne bei Bekannten in dem Haus unter dem Dach, die ihr Holz am Ende eines langen Ganges aufstapeln, wo man es durch eine Art Luke steckt und dann hinter irgendwelche Balken klemmt. Später, als ich um das Haus herum gehe, sehe ich, dass so alles Holz in der Luft über dem Hof schwebt, weil die Wand direkt unter dem Dach vorspringend geneigt ist und man das Holz dort draussen hinter die Balken gesteckt hat, so dass jedes falsch gesteckte Holz auf das Pflaster hinab und den Passanten auf den Kopf fallen kann.

Auch bin ich nie ganz sicher, ob es nicht doch ein Bulle ist, da ich den Euter nicht recht sehen kann, obwohl ich ihn am Anfang gesehen habe. Dolo sagt, es sei eine ganz ungefährliche Kuh.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0883 (1952-05-07 - Volksdorf)Traum von Arabern, denen ich so begegnete, wie Kasack den Menschen in der Stadt hinter dem Strom begegnet (1. Kapitel). Es war eine Art Reisepause. Ich war per Anhalter von einem eckigen Auto mitgenommen worden, und nun in einer Pause ausgestiegen. Die Araber sassen alle in weissen Gewändern und Turbanen auf einer provisorischen Bank und redeten eifrig. Ich hatte sie irgendwie gestört, und sie wurden zornig. Doch besänftigte ich sie, indem ich die Hände zur bittenden Gebärde legte. Dazwischen hinein spielte eine Szene, in der es um die Ausgrabung von Schätzen ging. Eine Frau -- wohl meine Schwester -- zog mich in ein Grundstück hinter einen Bretterzaun und zeigte mir einen Lageplan, aus dem ich ersehen sollte, wo der Schatz vergraben war. Sie wollte ihn gar nicht mehr ausgraben, weil schon der nächste Krieg drohte. Man sah allenthalben -- ich hatte das auch auf der Autofahrt gesehen -- neue Soldaten in Stahlhelmen. Ich warnte sie vor den Mitmenschen, die ihre Forschungen nach dem Schatz beobachtet haben könnten. Dann sassen diese Mitmenschen alle auf der Bank, und dann waren es die Araber. Der eine erzählte gerade: "Heute Nacht hat meine Gattin mir meine Tabakanlage (wohl eine Art Pfeiffenarrangement) umgeworfen." Schliesslich kam der Chauffeur, um mich zum Aufbruch zu holen. Es war sehr geheimnisvoll. (212 words)

Jenseits des abteilenden Vorhangs sind aber schon wieder Betten anderer Menschen. In eine andere Szene spielte die Königstrasse in Schwerin hinein. Ich stand auf der hinteren Plattform des offenen Anhängers einer rückwärts fahrenden Strassenbahn, die aus einer Seitenstrasse in die Königstrasse einbog und dabei rückwärtsrollend immer näher gegen einen stehenden grossen Lastwagen ankam. Wenn sie nicht sofort stoppte, musste es einen leichten Zusammenprall geben. Ich machte mich bereit, mich zu ducken. (121 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0886 (1952-05-11 - Göttingen)Traum von der Unterscheidung von Idealität und Realität, die sich in einer schwierigen geographischen Abgrenzung ausdrückten, die ich ins Stenogramm diktierte. Ein blau und weisser Vorhang, dessen Bild in meinem Traum einfiel, war ideales Sein. Aus diesem Bild wurde dann die geographische Landschaft, die ich im Unterschied zu der der Realität beschrieb. Meine Sätze wurden dabei sehr lang, und einmal so, dass sich die einbrechende Schlafmüdigkeit in ihrer Verwirrung andeutete. Ich liess mir den Satz noch einmal vorlesen und setzte für die falschen Worte die richtigen ein, so dass der ganze Text herauskam. Die Stenographinnen, denen ich diktierte, waren Frauen aus Wittmoldt, zuletzt Frau v. Buchholz. Ein Professor Reimers oder Reimer, der mein Stenogramm gehört hatte, sollte sich angeblich für den Text interessieren. (123 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0888 (1952-05-14 - Freiburg)Anderer Traum von Kindern, mit denen ich immer spielte, wenn ich an ihnen vorbeikam. Eine der Mütter, eine etwas hysterische Frau, wurde mir deswegen böse. Ich machte ihr schliesslich klar, dass auch ihr Junge in Folge ihrer Hysterie schon gehemmt war und zitterte. Sie begann zu weinen, ich tröstete sie. Andere Szene: Ein Traum des Jungen wird verfilmt. Man sieht viele Hühner laufen. Andere Tiere, die dann alle von einem grossen Ungeheuer überfahren werden. Jeder Szenenwechsel ist durch ein leichtes Dunkelwerden markiert. Die Verfilmung ist sehr überzeugend. Die Mittel einfach. Ich sitze während dessen bei Tisch, verdünne meine Milch aus Versehen mit Wasser. Ein Franzose (Monsieur V.) sitzt neben mir. Als ich mich vor Begeisterung des Anschauens über den Tisch lege, stösst er aus Spass mit seinem Kopf gegen den meinen. Mir läuft dabei Schweiss über den Leib. Zwei Frauen werden in dem Kindertraumfilm gezeigt, die merkwürdig lächelnde Münder haben, die im Gesicht nur undeutlich und verwischt angedeutet sind. Die Erwachsenen sagen: "Das bedeutet, sie haben gerade einen Kuss bekommen." (170 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0889 (1952-05-15 - Freiburg)Traum von Monsieur Mignot. Ich ging mit ihm ins Philosophische Seminar. Auf dem Flur dorthin mussten wir einmal über eine Stacheldrahtbarriere steigen. Auf dem Rückweg hielt uns der Hausmeister an, dieser Weg sei verboten, es solle doch heute die ganze Baracke (wohl neben dem Haus) abgerissen werden. Ich bot alle meine Überredungskräfte vor allem für Mignot auf, damit wir keine Strafe zahlen mussten. Hiervor andere Szene, aus der diese hervorging: Ich ging auf eine Weide. Pferde wurden durch einen Doppelzaun hineingelassen und galoppierten sofort von weitem auf mich zu. Ich trug eine Rosa-Zentifolia-Seife in der Hand, die es gerochen hatte. Ich steckte die Seife im letzten Moment in die Tasche, ehe sie es wahrnehmen konnten. Das Pferd nahm nun meine Hand ins Maul und trotttete neben mir her. Immer, wenn ich mich lösen wollte, biss es etwas zu und zwang mich dadurch, die Hand locker in seinem Maul liegen zu lassen. Als wir dort angekommen waren, wo das Pferd aus dem Tor gekommen war, stand uns der Weg nach rechts und links offen. Rechts in ein sonniges Koppelland, links an ein Seeufer. Ich ging links. Mein Begleiter, es war inzwischen der französische Lektor Monsieur Vandevordre geworden, sagte mir, dass er lieber rechts gegangen sei, weil er hier am Ufer frieren müsse, da keine Sonne sei. Eine Stunde frieren, bis wir auf diesem Weg wieder in die Sonne kämen. Dann nach einem erneuten Szenenwechsel wurde aus diesem Weg der Korridor zum Philosophischen Seminar in der Uni und aus dem Begleiter der französische Theologe Mignot, mit dem ich oft französische Sprachübungen machte.

Auch zwei Mädchen sind dabei: Sie wohnen aber zusammen in einer Stube. Sie erzählt mir, dass sie sich langweilen. Sie ist gut gewachsen, von einer schwellenden Körperlichkeit, und sitzt nackt vor mir. Ich spüre in den Fingern das Tastgefühl ihrer Haut, auch ohne sie zu berühren. Eines der Mädchen ist die Nichte des anderen, obwohl sie gleich alt sind. Einmal lege ich mich um auszuruhen auf Kissen flach auf den Boden in einem gartenartigen Vorhof und lese. Mädchen, die vorbeigefahren kommen, gucken mich an. Dann fahre ich mit einem Studenten in einem alten, aber dabei eleganten Auto. Es ist der Typ des Zeichners L. (Kunstakademie). Er wirkt schizothym, gleichgültig und dabei sympathisch und sensibel. (127 words)

Das ganze Haus war überhaupt von einer merkwürdigen Konstruktion. Mit vielen Türen, die ich hinterher gut zu verschliessen suchte. Es war im Osten und die Gegend gefährlich. Später sah ich dort ein Bild, das wieder im Stil der Kastelle gezeichnet war und das mir besonders gefiel. Es war in eine Pappe geritzt, mit höchst vereinfachten Formen von grosser Kompositionskraft, vor allem Rechtecke und Dreiecke. So bildeten die Schösse zweier Menschen einen solchen Dreiecksgipfel. Die Oberkörper waren nur ganz zart angedeutet. Die Vereinfachung hatte etwas Chinesisches. Grossartig war eine springende Katze, durch deren Kopfform der Kreis in das Bild kam. Ich versuchte sie nachzuzeichnen, doch gelang es mir nicht. Es waren viele Stilelemente von Ikas Art, Tongefässe zu ritzen, in dem Bild, doch von noch vereinfachterer und verstärkter Kompositionskraft. In diesem Rechteck, das schon die Kastelle kennzeichnete, steckt jedoch zugleich Spechts und Marions Schreibweise des M das Marion jedoch zum gewölbten Bogen verwandelte. (172 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0896 (1952-05-23 - Freiburg)Traum von Häusern, Gärten und Landschaften. Zunächst war ich mit unserer Emmi unterwegs. Wir verfolgten und kürzten auf unserem Weg den Zug der Strassen durch eine Schwarzwald-Berglandschaft. Dann handelte es sich um den Übergang in die Schweiz über eine Rheinbrücke -- wohl ohne Pass. Dann Bahnfahrt, die, sozusagen wie ein vorfahrender Wagen, vor einem wunderbar modernen weissen Haus endete, in dem ich wohnte. Emmis Gestalt changierte zuweilen in die Trudels (mit der ich gestern Nachmittag spazieren ging und dabei auch das weisse Haus auf einem Berg sah). In einer anderen Szene ging ich durch den Vorgarten, der dem des Schweriner Elternhauses glich, in das Haus und hielt die Haustüre noch zwei nachkommenden Mädchen, den beiden Italienerinnen, Töchter Peterich, auf, die zuweilen in meinem Käfig gewohnt hatten. Stieg dann zusammen mit ihnen die Treppe rauf. Die eine schwarz und von kleiner und geformter italienischer Gestalt, die andere blond und gross und weicher. (151 words)

Ich spüre aber etwas von der Frau (die Ähnlichkeit hat mit einer sehr sensiblen Frau, die ich im Philosophischen Kolloquium bei Szilasi und später öfter in der Mensa sah und schon zuweilen anzusprechen gedachte).

Ein Mädchen mit einem riesigen wagenradförmigen Strohut kam auf dem Fahrrad an mir vorbei, hielt plötzlich an, sprach mich mit Du an und redete von einem Flugzeug nach Amerika, wo ich mitfliegen könnte. Ich war von dieser Anrede so überrascht, dass ich zunächst von der Nachricht kaum etwas verstand. Ich nahm dem Mädchen den Strohhut hoch (wobei der grosse Rand sich übrigens allein abheben liess) um besser zu erkennen, wer sie sei, konnte mich aber noch immer nicht besinnen. Schliesslich fiel ich ihr mit den Worten: "Wer Du auch seist..." um den Hals und küsste sie -- auch dabei, ohne sie wiederzuerkennen. Noch im Erwachen dachte ich lange über die Identität der Gestalt nach, in der sich sehr viele Bilder verwoben hatten. (150 words)

Die Bilder wechseln in einem schnellen pulsierenden Rhythmus. Dann tritt eine Beruhigung ein. Tieferes Atmen. Eine allgemeine angenehme violette Färbung fliesst in den ganzen Bildgrund wie Musik, gleichzeitig werden Töne gehört, Stimmen, aber ohne Worte, die einen musikalischen Klang haben. Die Musik besteht aber nicht in Melodien, sondern lediglich im Hören des Klanges, sehr elementar. Dann plötzlich höre ich Stimmen einzelne Worte oder Satzbruchstücke sagen und merke den Beginn des Schlafes. Von den Worten ist mir nur noch das Wort Anfang in Erinnerung, das eine starke Bedeutung hatte. -- Im Allgemeinen war das Bedeutungsbewusstsein in diesen Bild- und Tonfolgen sehr stark. Sie waren nicht zerfahren, sondern eher elementar, aber von einem raschen und temperamentvollen Pulsieren und von einer solchen Fülle und Vielheit, dass es mir unmöglich schien, sie richtig festzuhalten -- der Akt der inneren Anschauung und des Ergreifens ging gleichsam zu schnell, als dass er ein Festhalten ermöglichte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0904 (1952-05-31 - Freiburg)Besuch bei Ika in ihrem Elternhaus. Auf dem Tisch steht ein Teller mit einer tiefschwarzen Glasur, den sie mir einmal zu Weihnachten geschenkt hat, und den ich diesmal mitnehmen will. Auf dem Teller steht eine Vase mit Blumen, die ich nun ohne diesen Untersatz auf den Tisch stellen will. Das gelingt aber kaum, weil der Tisch uneben ist. Schliesslich lehne ich sie halb an die Wand. Dann versuche ich, mit dem Bleistift Figuren auf dem Teller einzuritzen, allerlei Getier und Federvieh. Das gelingt mir aber schlecht, und ich beschliesse, die Sachen wieder auszuradieren. Auch Ika findet die Zeichnungen misslungen. Dann kommt die ganze Kinderschar, Ikas Geschwister, nach Hause. Die Situation wandelt sich etwas: Ich gehöre irgendwie mit zu diesen Kindern, sozusagen als der älteste unter ihnen. Irgend eine alte Tante ist da, die altmodisch hässlich in Schwarz gekleidet ist und allerhand moralisiert. Ich beschliesse schliesslich abzureisen. Die Situation hat sich jetzt ganz gewandelt. Es ist nicht mehr Ikas Elternhaus, auch Ika ist nicht da, sondern Heiss und das Psychologische Seminar. Ich habe ein Telephon, durch das ich mir die nötigen Dinge für meine Abfahrt bestellen will. Aber die Wählerscheibe hat sich verschoben. Ich entdecke auf dem Untergrund mehr Zahlen, als in der Scheibe Löcher sind, zum Beispiel vor der Eins noch viele Nullen, die den Kreis bis zur Neun schliessen. Wenn ich nun in das erste Loch der Wählerscheibe nicht die letzte, sondern eine frühere Null einstelle, verschiebt sich die Zahlenreihe. Ausserdem sind auch nach innen und aussen noch mehrere Zahlenkreise, so dass man die Scheibe auch exzentrisch einstellen kann, wobei dann auch die Zahlenfolge in sich unstetig wird. Ich verliere meine Zeit für die Reisevorbereitungen mit der Einstellung dieser Scheibe. Schliesslich fällt auch die Mittelpunktsschraube heraus. Ich versuche, sie wieder einzuschrauben, habe aber dann eine Mutter zu viel. Ich klage Heiss mein Leid, der der Chef des Instituts ist, und wache allmählich auf. Ein Bruchstück war noch zwischendurch im Traum: Gespräch mit Hf. über Tongefässe: Er sagt: "Wirklich schön sind die richtig gebrannten Tongefässe bei Heidegger" -- Ich: "Diese hier, Ikas, sind auch gebrannt." Er dachte, sie wären nur getrocknet. Ich: "Es gibt kaum wieder so leichte". (358 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0905 (1952-06-01 - Freiburg)[Pfingsten.] Traum von einem wunderbaren Fest, das von einer Kunstakademie veranstaltet wurde. Es waren Mädchen mit einem leichten Glanz und Schimmer auf den Gesichtern und jenen grossen Augen, die den Blick in sich hineinsaugen. Die Kostüme waren mit viel Weiss und Gold und heiter. Ich trug nach dem Fest eine goldenen Sänfte mit einem Mädchen aus dem Saal in das Haus, in dem die Akademie zu Hause war. Dieser Weg war merkwürdig, denn er führte durch viele Treppen, Tunnel und Tore in modernem Stile aus Beton wie bei Anlagen der Reichsautobahn, und die unter einer Kontrolle standen wie Funkhäuser oder Flugplätze, so dass alle Tore sofort hinter uns geschlossen wurden. Dann kamen wir wieder auf eine normale Strasse. Andere fuhren in goldenen Kutschen oder gingen zu Fuss. Ich schlängelte mich mit meiner Sänfte hindurch. Dann kam der Moment, wo wir in den Raum eintraten, der uns häuslicher war. Hier schwang das Fest noch nach, in jener glückhaften Stimmung, die oft den Zauber eines Festes im wartenden und darin geschäftigen Ausklingen des Aufbruchs am stärkstens konzentriert. Hier fielen auch die Blicke am tiefsten ineinander und schien sich eine Glanzschicht von dem Gesicht der anderen zu lösen und auf einen zuzuwehen, so dass man mitten in sie hineinging. Andere Szenen gingen diesem Traum voraus. So ein sportliches Spiel (in dem selben Raum, in dem diese letzte Szene des Aufbruchs spielte). Ein Spiel, bei dem sich die Körper hoch aufrecken mussten, um den Ball zu erhaschen. Um die beiden Mannschaften besser zu unterscheiden, entkleideten wir uns in der einen völlig. Das Problem war dabei, von der Aufrichtung des Gliedes in der Faszination des Körpers nicht befangen zu sein, sondern ganz nur Leib zu sein. Hieraus ging irgendwie unmittelbar eine andere Szene hervor, die von Heideggers Philosophie handelte, die ich irgendwo zu vertreten hatte. Daraus ging dann eine Wahl für eine Vertretung in den Bundestag hervor. Ich sass in einem Zimmer, in dem Heiss und andere mit der Regierung beschäftigt waren. Ich konnte mich zwar nicht beteiligen, da ich nicht genug von der Sache verstand, merkte aber, wie ich allmählich hineinwuchs. Diese Szene, wie auch die der Heideggerschen Philosophie und die nachkommende des Festes hingen dabei alle untereinander zusammen mit der glückhaften Unbefangenheit der Nacktheit. So sprach mich hier in dem Regierungsraum ein Mädchen an, die sich sowohl an die Darstellung der Philosophie Heideggers wie an das Ballspiel erinnerte und nun an den Zusammenhang und die damit verknüpfte Wahl erinnerte. Aus diesem Gespräch mit dem Mädchen entwickelte sich wohl die Szene des Balls. Dazwischen lag noch etwas anderes, das aber wohl schon in dem Saale spielte, aus dem nachher der merkwürdige Auszug über die Betontreppen stattfand und der das Ganze zum Bunker machte. (Übrigens fuhr auch jemand mit dem Motorrad die Betontreppen hoch -- sehr zu unseren Verwunderung). In diesem Saal, der zunächst eine Gastwirtschaft war, schwang irgendwie noch die Atmosphäre der Nacktheit des Ballspiels, hier aber als Unheimlichkeit. Auch das Wissen um Leichen, die in irgendwelchen Felskammern waren und, ich glaube, die Trunkenheit spielten hinein. (501 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0906 (1952-06-02 - Freiburg)Traum von Ika. Ich besuchte sie in einer Art Gasthaus, in dem man meine Besuche schon gewohnt war und ich ungehindert in ihr Zimmer gehen konnte. Die Einzelheiten des Traums habe ich vergessen, doch weiss ich, dass eine Atmosphäre innigen Vertrauens herrschte. Sie hatte Pläne für irgendwelche Umsiedlungen aus Volksdorf fort. Ich riet ihr jedoch, in Volksdorf zu bleiben. (59 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0907 (1952-06-04 - Menzenschwand)[In der Jugendherberge Menzenschwand im Schwarzwald auf einer Tour mit Yoie und Hf.] Yoie liegt neben mir in der unteren Etage des zweistöckigen Herbergsbettes, in deren oberer Hf. schläft. Später kommt noch irgendein Mann dazu und legt sich neben Yoie. Sie wendet sich ihm zu und gibt ihm einen Kuss. Ich liege auf der linken Seite, so dass ich ihnen direkt ins Gesicht schaue, bin aber zu müde, um mich auf die andere Seite zu drehen und sage dies. Dabei wird aber Yoie ein wenig unruhig, weil Hf. oben diese Worte hören und es ihn stören oder traurig machen kann. Andere Szene: Aufführung einer Oper im Stile von Gluck in einer feierlichen Umgebung. Im Mittelpunkt der Handlung steht eine tanzende Figur, wohl eine tanzende Gottheit von feierlicher Bewegung und barocker Gestalt und Gewandung. Andere Szene: Heimweg aus der Oper mit einem Begleiter (wohl wieder Hf.). Durch ein sehr aufgeweichtes Stadtgelände, in dem Lumpen und Papierfetzen herumliegen. Es scheinen alte Gerichtsakten zu sein. Graue Gebäude ziehen sich rechts der platzartigen Strasse entlang, die noch mit der Oper zusammenhängen. Scheinbar eine Art Kollegienhaus. Andere Szene: Drinnen in einer etwas kellerartigen, ein wenig gasthausmässigen Umgebung. Neben mir auf der Bank zwei Leute mit Musikinstrumenten, einem altmodisch harfenförmigen und einem modernen, etwas verkrüppelten Zupfinstrument (das den halbelektrischen gleicht, wie man sei auf der Frankfurter Messe sah). Im Ganzen eine unruhige Atmosphäre. Dann kommen die drei Tänzerinnen herein. Noch sehr angegriffen von der Oper -- in barocken Gewändern. Die Haupttänzerin sagt: "Ist denn hier auch keine Ruhe? Überall ist Lärm!" Die drei gehen an mir vorbei in das Innere des Hauses hinein. Die erste scheint mir zunächst viele gelb-rote Punkte auf der Haut zu haben. Dann aber sehe ich, dass sie mit Wachs bekleidet ist wie ein barocker Engel und dieses Wachs wie bei Kerzen, die gebrannt haben, sich stellenweise ein wenig ins Gelbe färbt. Sie hat ein sehr vom Tanz verinnerlichtes Gesicht, ähnlich wie Moira Sherer in den "roten Schuhen". Die zweite Tänzerin, ein wenig weltlicher, hat ein weites weisses Gewand, das unter der Schulter weit ausgeschnitten ist, so dass man den Körper sieht. Als die Tänzerinnen heraus sind, beginnen die beiden Musiker neben mir zu spielen, und zwar eine Melodie, die aus der Oper zu stammen scheint, die die Tänzerinnen getanzt haben. Sie spielen die sehr feierlich-heitere Melodie etwas verwässert, doch habe ich Lust zu tanzen. Führend ist das ältere Instrument mit einem Geigenton. Ein etwas formell-kanzleimässig aussehender Ober im schwarzen Anzug und mit schwarzer Brille bewegt sich nach der Melodie drehend durch den Raum, ein wenig die Tische aus der leeren Mittelfläche herausschiebend und mit seinem weissen Tuch abstaubend. Ich bin erstaunt über die mühelose Eleganz und Schnelligkeit seiner Bewegungen. Offenbar will er uns zum Tanz ermuntern. Erwachen. Ich habe noch deutlich die Melodie der beiden Musiker im Ohr und erkenne sie nach kurzer Besinnung deutlich als die des Vorspiels zu der Geigenarie "Erbarme Dich" aus der Matthäus-Passion.

Sie hatte zweitweise während des Traums durchaus die Züge eines männlichen Gegners und Angreifers. Erst nach der Verwundung brach mein Mitleid durch und ich war sehr um sie besorgt. Anderer Traum: Ich fand unter drei anderen, die hier in der Jugendherberge schliefen, einen, den sie Detlev nannten und der einmal den Namen Wittmoldt aussprach. Da erkannte ich ihn als Detlev den Eleven in Wittmoldt und redete ihn mit seinen Namen an. Er konnte wegen eines Unfalls nicht aus dem Bett. Ich fragte ihn: "Was fehlt Dir?" Er sagte: "Die Hand ist ab" -- und zeigte auf irgendwie verwundete oder gebrochene Hand. (119 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0911 (1952-06-06 - Feldberg/Schwarzwald)Ein dritter Traum entstand in dem Bestreben, den ersten nicht zu vergessen, sozusagen als sein gemildertes Klischee: Ausgrabung durch einen Archäologen. Er findet alte Dolche, sehr viele, zum Teil ohne Griff. Dieser ging dann in einen Traum vom Szilasi-Seminar über, wo ich ein Referat -- offenbar die Niederschrift des ersten Traums -- halten musste. Bei der Reportage über die archäologische Ausgrabung war mir der Gedanke gekommen, wie grausam es sei, einen ganzen 2000 Jahre alten Friedhof aufzuwühlen, nur um die Dolche der Begrabenen zu bekommen. Die Leiche hat in meinen Träumen immer wieder die Bedeutung der Leiblichkeit. (97 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0912 (1952-06-07 - Feldberg/Schwarzwald)[Unruhige Nacht, in der es vom Abend bis zum Morgen gewitterte. Traum um die Mitte der Nacht:] Ich war in einer Begleitperson, die zuweilen Emmis Züge trug, sonst aber männlich war, in Russland. Wir fühlten uns überall beobachtet und belauscht. In einem dunklen Tunnel, als Emmi mir etwas über das Land sagen wollte, schnitt ich ihr flüsternd die Rede ab: "Wir werden belauscht, nichts sagen, nur denken!" Jedes technische Zeug am Wegrand wurde in meiner Vorstellung zur Hörmuschel. Auf dem Wege über ein höher gelegenes Strassenstück, zu dessen Seite man einen grossen halb krankenhaus-, halb festungsartigen Gebäudekomplex liegen sah, schlug mein Begleiter vor: "Wir wollen in jenes Irrenhaus gehen, und versuchen, den armen Leuten dort zu helfen". Ich folgte ihm jetzt auf Seitenwegen über Dächer und Stufen hinweg, zuweilen fast schwebend, immer in dem Bemühen, keinesfalls zu stolpern. So hüpfte ich oft mehrere Stufen, oder von Dach zu Dach, auf einem Bein aufspringend, um in dem Sprung nicht von dem nachschleppenden Aufsetzen des zweiten Beins umgeworfen zu werden. Auch einen Russen sah ich in der Ferne so seinen Weg über die Dächer nehmen. Diese Art des Weges schien hier nicht ungewöhnlich zu sein, so dass niemand etwas argwöhnen konnte. Plötzlich landeten wir im Hof des Gebäudes zwischen lauter Irren und wurden dort ebenfalls als solche empfangen. Mein Begleiter beteuerte zwar auf Deutsch, dass wir keine wären, wurde aber nur sanft von den Pflegern in die Mitte genommen, die uns nun durch die Anstalt fort geleiteten. Dieser Gang hatte zunächst einen gewissen Reiz für mich, weil er das Leben der Schizophrenen zeigte. Dann bogen wir in einen tiefroten Saal ein. Eine kommentierende Stimme sagte etwas von einem Blut-Saal. Dann sah ich im Halbdunkel überall blutende Menschen, die hier auf primitive Weise operiert wurden und deren Blut dem Saal die tiefrote Färbung gab. Als ich mich umsah, hatte man bereits meinem Begleiter einen Dolch in die Kiefer gerammt. Er stand schweigend da, da er nichts mehr sagen konnte. Ich rief nun voll Entsetzen, ohne dass die Russen mich verstehen konnten, sehr artikulierend in deutscher Sprache: "Er-ist-ge-sund!". Und auf Lateinisch, da ich hoffte, sie würden das aus kirchlichen Gründen eher verstehen: "sanitus est, sanitus est." (Erwachen mit starker Angst und dem dunklen Wort "Blutsaal" und meinem Geschrei "sanitus est" im Ohr. Ich hatte Magenschmerzen. Auch hatte die Wunde eines Backenzahns, der mir vor einer Woche gezogen war, wieder angefangen zu bluten, und ich hatte einen starken Blutgeschmack im Mund.) (389 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0914 (1952-06-09 - Freiburg)Festessen bei Heidegger. Ich bin gekommen, um ihm irgend etwas zu helfen. Auch Brigitte mit ihren blonden Haaren treffe ich da. Heidegger ist spät von einer Reise zurückgekommen und bereitet sich auf eine Vorlesung vor. Ich bin zunächst im Vorzimmer, einer Art Bibliothek, und erwarte wie die Anderen, die schon im Zimmer sind, sein Heimkommen. Er kommt dann sehr schnell zur Tür hinein, läuft gleich ins Nebenzimmer. Ich stelle die Bücher zurück ins Regal und folge ihm und frage ihn, der schon am Schreibtisch sitzt, ob ich ihm auch etwas helfen dürfe. Mir scheint das fast aufdringlich, da schon viele da sind. Er ist aber sehr erfreut und lässt mich eine Schreibmaschine holen. Als ich schliesslich mit ihr, die ich von einem Herrn Lorenz holen sollte, ankomme, stellt sich heraus, dass in dem aktenschrankartigen Kasten nur Papiere sind. Ich war zu einem falschen Lorenz gegangen. Heidegger hatte mir den Vornamen nicht mitgenannt und ich ging zu Konrad Lorenz. Dann bei Heidegger eine Kaffeetafel. Es gibt Kuchen. Weihnachtliche Stimmung. Dann kommt Ricarda, der ein leerer Platz neben mir zugewiesen wird. Sie hat einen Weihnachtszweig mit Tannenzapfen und viel Lametta in der Hand, mit dem sie spielt. Später ist Heidegger nicht mehr im Raum. Es wird über seine Philosophie gesprochen. Jemand redet davon, dass das Dasein immer in Bewegung sein müsse, nicht stehen bleibe dürfe, fast dabei aber das Dasein so auf, wie Goethe das Bewusstsein. Ich sage zu ihm: "Sie identifizieren Dasein und Bewusstsein und argumentieren von Goethe her." -- Heiss spielt in dem Traum auch eine Rolle. Er ist bei Heideggers Abwesenheit zeitweise anwesend. Hier spielt eine vorhergegangene Szene hinein: Besuch bei Robert Heiss, der aber hier im Traum Robert Hess ist, der ehemalige Freund Hitlers, der uns eingeladen hat, weil er Besuch von einem ehemaligen Kriegsminister hat. Ich verspreche mir Interessantes von diesem Gespräch. Schon vor der Gartentür, der Garten ist vorstadtartig mit einer Hecke umzogen, treffe ich andere Studenten, mit denen ich dann hineingehe. Hieraus entsteht dann wohl mit einem Szenenwechsel der Heideggertraum. In einer anschliessenden Szene handelt es sich um Krischan. Er will dieselbe Universität besuchen. Die Frage ist, ob er in seinem Zimmer wohnen bleiben soll, oder zu mir in den Käfig ziehen (Es ist also so, als ob Göttingen und Freiburg nur einen Fussweg auseinander lägen, in derselben Stadt).

Mit beiden spreche ich nur flüchtig, doch mache ich Peter darauf aufmerksam, dass Gisela auch gerade im Hause unterwegs sei. Dann sehe ich ich meine Matratze liegen, die sich ganz steif anfühlt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0918 (1952-06-11 - Freiburg)Meine Schwester und ich lieben beide einen Mann sehr, ich ihn als erwünschten Freund, sie ihn als erwünschten Geliebten. Er ist älter als wir und uns überlegen. Wir müssen um ihn werben. Alli kommt in das Haus, in dem der Mann und mein Bruder und ich, wir beide zu Gast, wohnen, und klingelt. Ich schaue aus dem Fenster und spreche zu ihr auf die Strasse, wobei sie zu mir den Kopf heben muss. Sie sieht frisch und sehr jugendlich aus und begegnet mir zunächst mit jener Fremdheit oder Neuheit, mit der eine Frau einen überrascht, die man schon lange kennt und an der man neue Züge entdeckt, die einen beglücken. Sie sagt: "Ja, kann man denn so leicht in dieses Haus hinein kommen?" Ich sage: "Ja, ich öffne Dir." Dann ist aber die Szene so, dass wir offenbar beide auf dem Wege zu dem Hause sind und dann von einem Dienstmädchen eingelassen werden. Wir haben übrigens auf dem Wege zum Hause eine Banane, deren Schale wir zurückgeschlagen haben. Wir wissen um ihre Symbolbedeutung als Phallussymbol. Sie ist aber dort, wo man es wegen der ansetzenden Schale nicht mehr so genau sieht, angeknappert, sozusagen unvollständig. Das Dienstmädchen, das uns öffnet: "Ihr Bruder schläft schon so lange, wie tot" (oder ähnlich sagt sie, statt tot ein anderes Wort, was auf Faulheit, Laschheit oder sowas, aber herzlich, deutet). Ich denke: Sie will wohl saubermachen im Zimmer und sage: "Ich will ihn wecken." Gehe mit Alli (meiner Schwester) die Treppe rauf, von der unser Schlafraum sozusagen provisorisch in der Weise abgeteilt ist, dass man von oben hineinsehen kann. Mein Bruder liegt dort auf dem Fussboden (wohl ein Notlager) sehr regungslos. Wir (Alli und ich) gehen hinein, um ihn zu wecken. Er rührt sich nicht, ist tot. Alli sagt: "Du müsstest ihm das und das Mittel geben." Ich zucke die Achsel: "Das nützt nicht mehr." Ich probierere noch durch Berühren, um mich zu überzeugen, trete dabei auch aus Versehen mit dem Fuss auf seinen rechten s Arm, der unter der Decke nicht zu sehen ist. Alli streut ihm, aus Versehen anscheinend, Sand ins Gesicht, und bläst ihn dann wieder weg, wohl um zu sehen, ob er darauf noch reagiert. -- Ich sage, dass man unseren Arzt holen muss, um den Tod festzustellen, bin von allem sehr bestürzt.

Da aber so viele sich am Essen beteiligen, sind diese Haufen plötzlich zusammengewachsen und über meinen Abfallhaufen in der Mitte hinweg.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0922 (1952-06-13 - Freiburg)Gestern Abend im Schlaf hörte ich von der Strasse einen Pfiff, der mir wie ein mühsames Versuchen, ein Motiv zu pfeifen, vorkam. Ich stellte mir sofort Trudel draussen vor, die verzweifelt draussen stände und den Pfiff nicht zustande bringen konnte. Ich versuchte nun mit aller Gewalt, mich wach zu machen. Dies gelang auch, indem ich im Traum zur Lampe griff. Dies gelang auch: Das Licht flammte auf, und ich erwachte von dem Licht, ohne, dass ich dabei realisierte, die Lampe angezündet zu haben. Ich schaute aus dem Fenster. Es waren aber nur andere Leute draussen. Es war etwa Nachts um halb drei Uhr, und ich brauchte nun eine Weile, bis ich wieder einschlafen konnte, und es gelang erst, nachdem ich aufgestanden war und sehr viel von der frischen Nachtluft herein gelassen hatte. An dem Traumbild, mit dem ich mich geweckt hatte, war noch etwas Besonderes: Die Räumlichkeit meiner Stube war in dem Traumbild etwas anders als in der Wirklichkeit. Und zwar war der Bezug zu dem Fenster, das heisst also wohl zum Licht, dessen Vorstellung ich zum Erwachen brauchte, verändert, nämlich so, dass darin die Lage des Schreibtisches zu seinem Fenster und die des Bettes daneben zum anderen Fenster kombiniert waren, nun aber die Lampenschnur, zu der ich greifen musste, um das Licht einzuschalten, nicht rechts von mir, wie es, wenn ich im Bette liege, eigentlich ist, sondern links von mir hing, so wie ich sie greifen muss, wenn ich am Schreibtisch sitze. Dieses Problem, das heisst das tastende Suchen nach der Schnur, musste in dem Traum erst gelöst werden, ehe das geträumte Licht aufflammte und darin das wirkliche Erwachen geschah. Hier folgt im handschriftlichen Manuskript eine Zeichnung auf der man Tür und beide Fenster, das Bett und den Schreibtisch sieht und dazu die Bemerkung: L + R = links und rechts. Diese waren im Traum vertauscht: Die Lampenschnur war links anstatt rechts. Vom Schreibtischstuhl aus ist sie aber tatsächlich links. Das Bett stand nun im Traum irgendwie so, wie der Schreibtischstuhl steht, das heisst sozusagen in die Stube hinein. Ich versuchte noch nach dem Erwachen, als ich schon meinen Kopf zum Fenster heraus gestreckt hatte und dann wieder reingezogen hatte, mir darüber klar zu werden, ehe ich das Licht einschaltete. Bett und Schreibtisch stehen parallel. Es war nun so, als ob im Traum das Bett auf der anderen Seite des Schreibtisches anstelle des Schreibtischstuhls gestanden hätte, trotzdem aber das Fenster direkt links neben sich gehabt hätte. Nun hat man, auch wenn man auf dem Stuhl sitzt, links neben sich ein Fenster, aus dem man heraussehen kann, wenn es geflötet hat - weil nämlich man ja in Front zum Schreibtisch sitzt, während man im Bett parallel zu seiner Linksseite liegt. Es wurden also im Traumbild die Tageslage am Schreibtisch und die Nachtlage auf dem Bett und ihr jeweiliges Verhältnis zum natürlichen und künstlichen Licht (Lampenschnur und Fenster) in Hinsicht auf die Orientierung nach Rechts und Links kombiniert. (Auch hier neben dem handschriftlichen Text eine Zeichnung, die das darstellt). Das Orienterungsmoment spielt nun in allen meinen Aufwachträumen eine Rolle, vor allem auch das von oben und unten, waagerecht und senkrecht, insofern als nämlich man im Traum, während man real als Schlafender liegt, sich als Gehender oder Stehender träumt und im Erwachen das Orientierungsproblem nun in der Umordnung von Waagerecht und Senkrecht liegt. Einmal träumte ich dies Verhältnis so, dass ich über fremde Körper hinweggehen musste und dabei im Erwachen entdeckte, dass es mein eigener Körper war, der sozusagen vom Auge aus gesehen noch vor mir lag, ein ander Mal war es, dass einfach die Flächen des Zimmers, deren Licht durch die geschlossenen Lieder drang, umgedeutet war, so eine dunkle Schrankwand, die am Fussende meines Bettes aufragte, zu einem Boden über den ich hinwegschritt. Eine grosse Rolle spielt das Moment der Schwerkraft in meinen Träumen, das mit der Orientierung von oben-unten, waagerecht-senkrecht und rechts-links zusammenhängt. Von hier aus gibt es einen wichtigen Zugang zur Geographie des Traums, zumal als Oben und Unten und Rechts und Links ja auch immer symbolische Bedeutung haben: Ob wir zum Beispiel eine rechte oder eine linke Strasse wählen, ob wir steigen oder sinken, liegen oder gehen, fliegen oder am Boden festgebannt sind.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0923 (1952-06-15 - Freiburg)Heimweg aus der Universität. Durch eine parkartige Weganlage von etwas barockem Charakter. Treppen, doppelseitige Umrundung von Beeten etc., Einschneiden in symmetrische Gehölze, kanalartige Wasserkunst. Kurz vor mir geht ein Paar, das mir durch seine un-romantische und vitale Art sympathisch ist. Da sie ungefähr in dem gleichen Rhythmus gehen wie ich, an den gleichen Stellen Pausen machen und an den gleichen Stellen (zum Beispiel. im schattigen Wald schneller schreiten), trifft es sich, dass wir immer in der Nähe bleiben. An einem Rundbeet, um das sie links und ich, glaube ich, rechts herumgehen, küssen sich die beiden. Ich habe eine starke Zuwendung zu dem Mädchen. Ihre Kleidung hat jenen modernen Zug des technischen, der sich in Knöpfen, kurz angeschnittenen Nähten und handfesten Stoffen ergeht. Im Waldstück versuche ich das Paar zu überholen, um nicht den Eindruck der Aufdringlichkeit zu erwecken. Ich komme dann nach Hause (wie nach dem Heimweg aus der Schule in das Elternhaus in Schwerin. Zugleich ist es aber die hiesige Situation.) Es wird über die Essenszeit und die Einteilung des Tages gesprochen. Ich will einen Ausflug mit Yoie und Hf. zur Insel Kaninchenwerder (im Schweriner See) machen. Ich spreche mit Elisabeth Baumgarten darüber aus dem Fenster gelehnt, während sie aus einem anderen Fenster guckt, so dass wir uns beide sehen können. Zugleich schauen wir beide auf den See hinab, der etwas windbewegt ist. Andere Szene: Wir beobachten Flugzeuge, die über dem See und über uns Loopings drehen. Sehr gewagt. Zuweilen fast die Wasserfläche berührend, dann wieder steil hochziehend, oft dicht an einander vorüberbrausend. Im Hintergrund ist immer noch die Insel Kaninchenwerder. Einmal kommt eines der Flugzeuge mit einem Seil, dass es hinter sich schleppt, in den Propeller des anderen. Wir fürchten einen Absturz. Das getroffene Flugzeug kommt bedrohlich dicht über uns hinweg. Automatisch fahren die Strassenbahnen, in denen wir sitzen, zwei Wagen, die hintereinander geparkt haben, los, um den Fall des Flugzeugs auszuweichen. Dann scheint es hinter uns auf dem Wasser notgelandet zu sein. Irgend jemand sagt, es könnte dem Propeller und der Flugfähigkeit nichts geschadet haben. Mich beschäftigt das wie selbstverständliche Losfahren der Strassenbahnen, als ob die Fahrer auf diesen Unfall vorbereitet gewesen wären. -- Andere Szene: Wieder in der Parkanlage. Ich gehe diesmal in umgekehrter Richtung. Hf. und Yoie haben einen Bekannten, der uns auf der geplanten Tour im Auto und Motorboot mitnehmen will. Ich treffe sie, das heisst den Mann, die beiden und zwei Amerikaner, im Motorboot auf der barocken Kanalanlage des Parks (die ein wenig wie der Kreuzkanal in Schwerin wirkt). Sie halten an; der Mann sagt mir so etwas ähnliches wie, dass ich auf eigene Gefahr mitführe. Ich überlege noch, dass das Boot ja eigentlich voll sei. Habe aber Zutrauen, dass für mich die richtige Lösung vorgesehen sei. Ende des Traums. (457 words)

Wir feiern orgiastische Feste vor Gesines Tür auf dem Flur. Gesine ist dabei wie eine grosse Mutter. Die Schülerin entkleidet sich. Der Psychologe geht dann fort. Wir haben bei allem eine geniale Unordnung. Später ruft Gesine, die inzwischen in den Käfig gegangen ist, mir zu, es sei jetzt Zeit aufzuhören. Wir greifen unsere Kleider, wie wir sie packen, ich entsinne mich, dass mir ein Schuh, der aussah wie der Schuh Trudels, immer wieder herabfiel, und schleppe sie in den Käfig, um uns anzukleiden. Dort ist, zu meiner Verwunderung, noch der Psychologe. Dann Szenenwechsel: In Benders Institut. Bender will ein Platzexperiment machen. Die Topographie der letzten Szene ist darin irgendwie enthalten. Die Frau (Gesine Schülerin) muss mir schräg gegenüber sitzen. Der Psychologe aber an der Stirnseite des Tisches. -- Jetzt fallen mir frühere Szenen des Traums ein, zum Beispiel: In einem Haus, ähnlich dem Elternhaus in Schwerin. Es dringen plötzlich Ströme von Wasser aus einem kleinen Rohr in der Wand hervor. Ich versuche, es zu stoppen, indem ich Brot, einen Schwamm und anderes hineinstopfe. Doch das ist natürlich vergeblich. Ich bin sehr erregt. Zumal ich die Anderen zu lax finde, die viel zu kleine Schüsseln unterstellen, welche sofort überlaufen. Die Oberbewohner, die sonst nicht in ihrer Wohnung sind und jetzt plötzlich ihre Wasserleitung benützen, scheinen hereinzuspielen. Ich sehe kurz die untersetzte Gestalt von Frau Tosch. (237 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0929 (1952-06-22 - Freiburg)Traum von Szilasis Seminar. Wir feierten den Geburtstag von Frau Öhlkers (wie gestern dort in Wirklichkeit). Ich sitze zwischen ihr und Szilasi. Es gibt einen Kuchenauflauf (den wir zu Hause "englischer Pudding" oder "suet pudding" nannten (topfartig mit viel Rosinen darin.) Der Teller (mein Schmetterlingsteller) biegt sich, weil er geflickt ist. Beim Essen passieren mir viele Malheurs, zum Beispiel kullern die Rosinen vom Teller. Ich muss plötzlich ziemlich grundlos weinen und kann das nicht ändern, obwohl ich es vorher kommen sehe. Szilasi ist sehr erzürnt über die Störung der Harmonie der Geburtstagsfeier. Ich gehe freiwillig heraus. Im Vorraum begegnet mir eine Frau, die wohl in das Haus gehört, mit einem bissigen Hund an der Leine (kleiner Dackel). Die Leine ist aber so lang, dass der Hund mich trotzdem beissen kann. Er kommt auf mich zu geschossen und meine Hand kommt zwischen seine Kiefer, doch so, dass ich sie vorher in letzten Moment noch in ein Stück meiner Kleidung verstecken und gleichsam darin einschlagen kann, so dass sie mit dem Stoff in das Maul kommt und der Biss nicht gefährlich werden kann. Trotzdem kann ich die Hand nicht gleich herausziehen, da der Hund sie in einem elastischen Verschluss zwischen seinen Zähnen festhält, ohne direkt zu beissen -- würde ich sie aber herausziehen, so würde er sofort die Zähne fester schliessen. So bleibt mir nichts anderes übrig, als die Hand locker im Maul liegen zu lassen. (234 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0930 (1952-06-22 - Freiburg)Mit Hf., Yoie, und, ich glaube, auch Peter und Gisela auf der Strasse. Ich treffe Ricarda, lasse die anderen allein weitergehen und rede mit ihr. Ich duze sie und wir küssen uns. Sie hat ein neues Fahrrad im Mercedes-Stil. Ich fordere sie auf, sich hinten drauf zu setzen, und will sie nach Hause fahren. Sie baut zwar irgend eine Sicherung ein, wie mit den Worten: "Aber nicht das ganze Stück". Ich antworte: "Das ist ja auch gar nicht nötig." Sie setzt sich hinten drauf, wobei sie mit ihren langen Beinen fast auf den Boden reicht -- aber kaum, dass wir ein Stück gefahren sind, sehen wir auf dem nächsten Berg einen Polizisten, der Verkehrskontrolle macht. Er hat uns zwar schon gesehen, aber, da er nur zu Fuss ist, glaube ich, dass wir ihm entwischen können. Ich weise Ricarda an, schnell durch die nächste Seitenstrasse in die Parallelstrasse zu gehen, wo wir uns wieder treffen können. Ich selbst will mit dem Rad ein Stück weit zurück fahren, damit es nicht auffällt, und dann selbst durch Seitenstrassen auf die Parallelstrasse und damit wieder zu Ricarda gelangen. Ich fahre sehr schnell, bin aber erstaunt, wie steil der Weg bergab geht, und bedaure, dies alles nochmal wieder bergauf fahren zu müssen. Mein Rad fährt in grosser Geschwindigkeit, ich bin wie im Rausch. Hinter mir kommt ein Auto, ein Volkswagen, der kurvt, da ich ziemlich in der Mitte auf der Strasse fahre. Ich biege noch im letzten Moment auf die Seite der Strasse ein, bin aber so dicht vor ihm, dass ich schon fürchte, in Karambolage zu kommen. Ich zeige darum mit der Hand rechts heraus, so wie überholende Wagen ihren Winker herauszumachen pflegen. Die Geschwindigkeit ist so gross, dass der Wagen mich nicht überholt, sondern ich dauernd direkt vor ihm fahre, aber er folgt mir so unmittelbar, dass ich in keine der Seitenstrassen einbiegen kann, da dazu der Spielraum zu gering ist. So sause ich immer mehr den Berg hinab. Dann verengt sich die Strasse, wie an einem Ortseingang. Ich zeige nun die Hand nach links heraus, um das Auto auf die Strassenverengung und mein damit nötiges Einbiegen aufmerksam zu machen. Beim Einbiegen habe ich dann soviel Vorsprung erlangt, dass ich in die nächste Seitengasse abbiegen kann, die wirkt wie ein einer Hafenstadt. Ich fahre unter Wäscheleinen hindurch und um kurvige Ecken, durch kurze platzartige winklige Strassen, zunächst noch nicht wissend, wo sie mich auf die Parallelstrasse führen werden, sehe auf dem Hintergrund das Wasser, wohl des Hafens. Bei alledem ist meine Geschwindigkeit noch so gross, dass ich mit dem Schwung aufs äusserste rechnen muss, um nicht in den Kurven der Strasse aus der Bahn geschleudert zu werden. Schliesslich habe ich die Parallelstrasse und treffe Ricarda wieder, die mir entgegengekommen ist. Ich erkläre ihr, warum ich so weit zurückgefahren sei, und sie antwortet: "Es war ja auch anzunehmen, dass auf der Parallelstrasse zur gleichen Zeit auch Kontrollen sein würden". Es war allerdings nicht der Fall. Erwachen. Nach dem Erwachen hatte ich zunächst sehr deutlich einen Geruch in der Nase, der sich bei einer Besinnung als Ricardas Parfum oder Seifengeruch herausstellte. (516 words)

Gesine hat sich gerade schlafen gelegt und schlägt vor, die Stunde auf fünf Uhr zu verschieben. Ich sage zuerst zu, dann fällt mir aber ein, dass ich damit die Heidegger-Vorlesung verpassen würde. Das beunruhigt mich. -- Dann eine andere Szene. Ich habe ein geschäftliches Schriftstück meines gefallen Halbbruders Jochen, in dem er über eine Geldangelegenheit mit Heidegger verhandelt hat. Heidegger hat einiges dazu zwischen die Absätze geschrieben. Ich studiere die Schrift. Dabei fallen mir die Worte "Robert Heiss" auf. Es handelt sich um eine Geldangelegenheit an der auch Robert Heiss beteiligt ist. Der entsprechende Satz lautet ungefähr: "Wenn Robert Heiss einverstanden ist." Es muss sich um eine Geschäftsangelegenheit handeln, bei der Heiss eine Rolle spielt und Heidegger auf ihn Rücksicht nehmen muss. Andere Szene: Ich bin unten in der Stadt, wohl in der Universität, in Räumen, eigentlich Klosetts, die im Carré in einer grossen Vollkommenheit angelegt sind und die alle irgendwie auf Heidegger bezogen sind. Ich studiere die kleinen zellenartigen Räume - die in sich wieder den Komplex einer Zelle bilden und durch die man Uhrzeigersinn herumgeht, wobei aber die vier Grundrichtungen in der Architektur betont sind -, besonders ihre Fenster und ihre Masse gründlich. So etwa wird die Anlage gewesen sein (rekonstruiert). (Hier ist im handschriftlichen Original eine Zeichnung eines Quadrats mit neun Feldern). Doch berührte ich wohl nur die Räume, durch die der Pfeil ging (der Pfeil in der Zeichnung spart das mittlere kleine Quadrat un die drei rechten aus). (286 words)

Lebensjahr). 2) Dann der Traum von meinem Bruder, der nachts auf den Topf gesetzt wird und bedrohlich und gefährlich ist, verändert wie ein Dämon (auch in Hamburg). 3) Aus der Hamburger Zeit und den Besuchen in Schwerin: Fahrt auf dem Schweriner See. Emmi taucht mich an den Haaren ins Wasser, bis auf den Grund. Hochschnellen bis über die Wasserfläche. Erwachen auf der Wasserfläche aufschlagend = im Bett. 4) In Schwerin, nach dem 6. Lebensjahr: Angstträume vom Feuer, dann -- beglückend -- von der Überschwemmung. War wasserscheu, liebte aber das Gewitter. (101 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0935 (1952-06-25 - Freiburg)Traum vom Erwachen, und zwar hatte ich geträumt von einem Gang auf der Strasse, bei dem ich in einer Spiegelung in einer Sonnenbrille das Innere meiner Stube mit dem Bild des Drachens an der Wand sah. Dann träumte ich, ich sei erwacht, läge wirklich in meinem Bett und sehe im Erwachen dieses Bild und erzähle es nun jemand, der mit mir im Zimmer wäre. -- Das Ganze war zu später Morgenstunde. Wahrscheinlich fiel das Bild jenes Bildes, das ich von meinem Bett aus sehe, im Halbschlaf in meinen Traum ein. (90 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0939 (1952-06-26 - Freiburg)Ich stehe an einem Münsterportal und betrachte die Figuren an der Wand. Durch die geöffnete Tür sehe ich die Gestalten, Gläubige in modernen Kleidern, im Innern des Doms. Ein Mann von der Strasse, der sich eine Zigarette anzündet, kommt lachend vorbei und weißt mich auf zwei Figuren in der Mauer: "Witzig, das hinter der Brücke zu verstecken". Ich sehe aus Stein, als ich dort hingucke, zwei Wasserspeiergestalten übereinander liegen, die eine mit dem Bauch auf dem Rücken der anderen und zwar sind es zwei Männer. Teilweise sind ihre Köpfe durch das eingemeisselte Bild einer Brücke verdeckt. Während ich noch betrachtend stehe, kommt ein bekannter Student vorbei, an den ich mich nur noch dunkel erinnere, spricht mich mit Namen an und ergänzt gleich: "Ich heisse Gehlen, da Sie ja meinen Namen bestimmt wieder vergessen haben". - "Ich muss gestehen", antworte ich, "dass ich mich wirklich nicht besinnen kann". Andere Szene: Zeitungsverkäuferin gibt mir von einer Musikzeitung mehrere bestellte Exemplare, die, obwohl offenbar gleichen Inhalts, verschieden teuer sind, und zwar drückt sie mir ein Exemplar für Gesine in die Hand, das kostet zwei Mark. Dann eines für Mozart, kostete, glaube ich, nur vier Pfennig. Ich selbst muss achtzig Pfennig bezahlen. Ich frage: "Ja, habe ich die Zeitung auch bestellt?" - "Ja", sagt sie. "Dann möchte ich sie gleich abbestellen, ich kann sie ja bei den anderen mitlesen". Ich wundere mich noch, dass Gesine mehr bezahlen muss als Mozart. Offenbar richtet sich der Preis nach dem Einkommen. (244 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0941 (1952-06-26 - Freiburg)Der Münsterturm wird repariert. Dazu werden grosse Teile der Füllungen aus der durchbrochenen Sandsteinarbeit des Turmes herausgenommen, so dass nur ein durchsichtiges Gerippe übrigbleibt, dass den Eindruck einer gefährlichen Leerheit zeigt. Der Turm scheint weiter, etwas von seiner Gerafftheit zu verlieren, ähnlicher dem des Ulmer Münsters, wo die Fluchtlinien der Senkrechten übersteigert betont sind. Man hat die Füllungen aus dem Wege über Feuerleitern hinausgenommen, um sie unten zu reparieren. Der auf sein Minimum an Konsistenz reduzierte Turm beginnt schon ein wenig sich einzubiegen. Die Baumgärtnerin, die mit mir zusieht, meint: "Wenn man ihn schon nicht wieder hinkriegen kann, soll man ihn lieber ganz wegnehmen. Der passt doch nicht mehr zwischen die moderne Architektur." Mich schaudert der Gedanke, oft auf diesen Turm gestiegen zu sein, obwohl die Architektur schon baufällig war. Die Sandsteinziselierungen hatten ja bei dem Bombenangriff gelitten, der die Nachbarhäuser zerstörte. -- Andere Szene: Ich sitze mit Hf., der eine neue Freundin hat, und Peter in einem Park auf einer Bank vor einem Gartenhäuschen. Peter spielt -- jetzt aufgestanden -- während des Gesprächs mit einer Sonnenblume, die auf einem Weg steht, und richtet dabei Stil und Blätter übel zu. Ein kleiner, aber doch gepflegter Mann, den ich sehr bald als Gärtner erkenne, kommt den Weg von hinten heran und stellt Peter zur Rede. Dieser erkennt ihn nicht als den Gärtner, sondern hält ihn für einen moralisierenden Fremden und sucht ihm auszuweichen. Schliesslich bietet er ihm ironisch die Blume an: "Wollen Sie vielleicht die Blume haben?" und macht die Gebärde des Stil knickenden Abpflückens. Der Mann ist darüber sehr aufgebracht und haut ihm eine Ohrfeige. Erst jetzt erkennt Peter den Gärtner und ist sehr schuldbewusst und betreten. Der Gärtner ändert nun sofort seine Haltung und schenkt Peter die Blume: "Nehmen Sie sie mit, aber machen Sie nicht viel Aufhebens darum." Peter fragt noch: "Wo soll ich die Blume hintun, so lange wir noch hier sitzen?" Der Gärtner: "Hinten ins Gartenhaus". Dann kommt auf einem anderen Weg eine Meute von sehr gepflegten weiss-braunen Windhunden heran, die mir Angst und Wonne, ja Faszination zugleich erzeugen. Sie gehören dem Gärtner, der als Obergärtner dem ganzen Park zu befehlen hat, dem auch die Meute anzugehören scheint. Ich hocke auf dem Weg an der Wand des Gartenhäuschens und die Meute sammelt sich um mich. Ein gefährlicher Hund scheint in einen Wagen eingesperrt zu sein -- wohl der Leithund. Die anderen Windhunde um mich haben -- wie sehr edle Tiere -- das Maul leicht geöffnet, die rote Zunge herabhängend. Sehr edle schmale Köpfe und Leiber. Sie nähern sich mir und meiner Hand mit den Mäulern, sie sozusagen nur locker hineinnehmend, aber ich empfinde das nur undeutlich. Es geht sozusagen in der Faszination und Innigkeit der ganzen Handlung unter. Ich spreche mir in einer Art Selbstgespräch mit den Hunden Mut zu, indem ich mir sage: "Ich habe ja oft von Euch geträumt". Jetzt ist es sozusagen Ernst, was im Traum ausprobiert wurde. Im Grunde bin ich sehr glücklich zwischen den Windhunden. Dann, in einer anderen Szene (diese und die beiden letzten hängen aber in einem flüssigen Verlauf zusammen) sitzt der Gärtner mit uns auf der Bank. Peter hat seinen Humor schon wiedergewonnen. Er steht vor mir auf dem Weg, ist mal wieder von der Bank aufgesprungen, wie es seiner Art gemäss ist, und bemerkt, dass ich ja der zweitälteste sei, von denen, die hier versammelt sind. Ich bin zunächst verwundert, denn Peter wirkt -- mit einem Bart, der allerdings noch im Entstehen ist, viel älter als ich. Ich besinne mich aber darauf, dass er wirklich jünger ist. Auch Hf. und die neue Freundin sind jünger. Peter will mich nun an der Bank so rangieren, dass wir in der Reihenfolge des Alters sitzen, lanciert mich aber dabei noch hinter den alten Mann, den Gärtner. Ich schlage ihm nun ein Schnippchen, indem ich in einer halb tänzerischen Bewegungen mich im Halbkreis auf das andere Ende der Bank bewege und so neben der neuen Freundin sitze. Ich beginne mit ihr zu flirten und wir küssen uns. Szenenwechsel: Das Mädchen und ich sind zusammen in der Kantine eines grossen Gebäudes, wohl einer Hochschule, und flirten noch. Dann gehe ich in das Gebäude hinauf, um etwas zu holen. Muss durch einen langen Gang mit gekalkten Wänden, schmal wie in einem Bunker. Dann wieder Treppen hinauf. Dort begegne ich einem Professor. Es ist der Psychotherapeut Hattingberg, mit dem ich über meine Träume sprechen wollte. Jedoch trägt er zugleich Züge von dem Musikprofessor Seiler (Bratschist). -- Beide tragen auch im Leben, wie hier die Traumfiguren, eine Baskenmütze. -- Auch hat er wohl noch Züge von einem Mann aus der Kunstakademie (den ich einmal aus Versehen als Professor anredete, was mich merkwürdig bedrückte.) So kann ich ihn nicht recht identifizieren. Habe aber das Gefühl der vertrauten Bekanntschaft und rede ihn mit Professor an. Auch weiss ich, dass er mit meinen Träumen und der Psychologie zu tun hat. Doch ehe ich davon reden kann, spricht er mich freundlich, mich auf der Treppe mit sich ziehend, an: "Sie sind der einzige hier in der Hochschule, der auch etwas künstlerische Absichten hat, darum möchten wir Sie mit zu unseren Trinkgelagen haben." Ich bin sehr erfreut über diese Aussicht, und wir schlendern weiter zurück in die Kantine, wo ja noch das Mädchen wartet. Dabei langsames Erwachen, wobei ich mir noch die Wiederbegegnung mit dem Mädchen ausmale. (Danach hatte ich zunächst alle Träume vergessen. Ärgerte mich, dass ich heute Morgen nichts geträumt haben sollte. Dann fiel mir nacheinander die ganze Serie wieder ein, die jedoch nur mit Hilfe einer längeren Meditation im Bewusstsein festzuhalten war.) (925 words)

Dies geschah wohl auf dem Rückweg von dem Besuch bei einem alten Herrn, wohl einem Dichter, einem alten Freund der Baumgärtnerin, der eine interessante Korrespondenz, anscheinend mit Goethe, geführt hatte. Andere Szene zu Hause. Wohl nach dem Besuch. Mein Vater zieht zwei alte Holzplastiken unter dem Bett hervor, die ich als Figuren von Hans Multscher erkenne. Ich bin beglückt von ihrer Freiheit und Heiterkeit der Bewegung und möchte sie gerne in meinem Zimmer aufstellen, aber Vater will sie wieder unter dem Bett verstauen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0943 (1952-04-28 - Freiburg)Traum von einem Wohnwagen, einer Kutsche, bei dem ich in den Pausen die Zügel der Pferde halten muss. Die Tiere sind sehr sensibel, gehen zuweilen ein wenig vor-- und rückwärts. Ich muss ihnen jeweils etwas Lockerheit lassen, um das auszugleichen. Eine Ärztin spielt in den Traum hinein. Während der Fahrt füllt sich der Wohnwagen. Es wird immer enger. Zwei Motorradfahrer sind am Strassenrand gestürzt und liegen -- vielleicht tot - im Graben. Ich brauche mich jedoch nicht um sie zu kümmern, da ich die Pferde halten muss. -- Brauche, sage ich, weil mir der Anblick des technischen Todes mit seiner Verstümmelung grausig ist. (103 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0944 (1952-06-30 - Freiburg)Heute Morgen nach elf-stündigem Schlaf kurze abgerissene Traumbilder, wie Schmetterlingsflügel, deren Konsistenz sich nicht bewahren liess. Denn schon nahe dem Erwachen ein längerer Traum vom Schlangestehen. Es ging um die Hoover-Speisung. Als ich schon sehr lange in der Schlange gestanden hatte, fiel mir ein, dass Onkel Gerd in der Metallindustrie arbeitet und vielleicht dem Hilfswerk, das die Speisung zu verteilen hatte, helfen könne. Ich suchte nun lange im Telephonbuch die Nummer. Die Titelblätter der Telephonbücher fehlten. Die Orientierung war schwierig. Ich kam nicht zum Schluss. Als ich an den Schalter kam, war die Schlange schon vorbei, und man wollte mich nicht abfertigen, vertröstete mich auf unbestimmte Zukunft und wollte mir auch gar nicht glauben, dass ich überhaupt in der Schlange gestanden hätte. Ich zeichnete nun der Frau am Schalter genau die Schlange auf. "Im Hof. Erst war sie so" (da folgt eine Zeichnung eines Rechtecks, durch das ein im Zickzack verlaufender Pfeil geht. Daneben steht:) "Hier war ein Schalter. Da habe ich ganz vom Ende her dringestanden. Dann war sie anders." (Jetzt folgt wieder eine Zeichnung mit einem Rechteck und der gebrochene Pfeil läuft rückwärts.). "Aus dieser Schlange ging ich zuletzt fort um zu telefonieren". Nun sagte die Frau: "Ja, eilt es denn so? Deine Mutti wird doch sicher heute etwas anderes zu essen haben." Ich schrie auf: "Die ist doch längst tot. Ich bin ja ganz allein. Sie ahnen ja gar nicht, wie schwer das ist!" Ein Student -- ähnlich der Figur Kirchgässners -, der neben mir am Schalter stand, sagte sehr gütig: "Armer Freund". Die Frau am Schalter nahm nun stillschweigend ihren Aktendeckel und holte Hoover-Marken für Konserven und Speisen heraus und stellte davon eine Sammlung zusammen, die mir für das ganze Semester zu reichen schien. Zuletzt griff sie noch zu strahlend farbigen Briefmarken mit aufgedruckten Geldwerten. Die Begeisterung der Studenten am Schalter über diese Besitz- und Machtansammlung war sehr gross. Erwachen.

Sie schien zunächst ein zahmes Haustier, lebte in der Stube einer alten Dame, die mein Vater kannte. An der Art, wie sie auf mich zu kroch, erkannte ich plötzlich ihre Gefahr, die anscheinend an mir zum ersten Mal akut wurde. Ich steckte ihr eine Stange in den aufgesperrten Rachen und hielt sie mit der Länge dieser Stange von mir zurück, während ich mich aus der Tür zurückzog. Die anderen Insassen des Zimmers, die alte Dame und ein kleines Mädchen, das schon vorher eine Rolle gespielt hatte, zogen sich später fluchtartig durchs Fenster zurück, so dass wir alle draussen standen und die unheimliche Schildkröte allein im Zimmer war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0947 (1952-07-02 - Freiburg)Anderer Traum von einer ASTA-Sitzung (Studentenausschuss). Es ging eine lebhafte Debatte um die Frage der Anschaffung eines Funkgerätes. Die einen wollten ein kleines, schnell bewegliches, mit dem man schlagfertig in den Tageskrieg eingreifen konnte, die anderen wollten das grosse schwere behalten, mit dem man selbst Nachrichten aus Amerika empfangen konnte, mit dem man aber, wie die Andersgesinnten sagten, überall drei Tage zu spät kam. Es schien jedoch diesen mehr an der guten Information, vor allem in Isolierungszeiten, als am schnellen Eingreifen zu liegen. Dann ging die Debatte um eine andere Frage: Es waren Anleihen ausgegeben worden, in Höhe von je hundert Mark. Doch hatten einige ein paar Mark mehr, andere ein paar Mark weniger erhalten. Die Frage war zu klären. Der Ausgeber hatte bei der Anweisung Bananen und Puffreis gegessen. Nun galten aber Reiskörner für die Ausgabe als Anweisung auf Markstücke. So waren einige Reiskörner zwischen die Bananen -- die übrigens jetzt im Traum den Gegenstand der Ausgabe zu bilden schienen -- gekommen. Es war so, dass einige Bananen multsch waren. Diese durfte der Anweiser für sich aufessen. Es wurden nur schöne glatte und straffe ausgegeben. -- Anschliessend: Hundetraum: Hundebad in Hamburg. Doch war es im Traum so breit -- eine breite ins Wasser führende Pflasterstrasse, wie es mir als kleinem Kind erschienen war. (214 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0951 (1952-07-06 - Freiburg)Traum, in dem der Zusammenhang von Zeigen - Schicken - Das Geschickliche - Das Geschinkliche - Rücken und Sandale eine Rolle spielen. Die Evidenz war dabei von triebhafter Faszination. Andere Szene: Engelin und Gisela kommen mir auf Motorrädern entgegen, beide in der Heiterkeit leichter Trunkenheit. Gisela kann ja gar nicht Motorrad fahren. Aber jetzt kann sie es. Sie werden von der Polizei angehalten. O weh. Sie hat auch nicht mal einen Führerschein. Soll eine Strafe von sechzig Mark bezahlen. Wir versuchen, die Polizisten zu beschwatzen. Das Ganze spielt in einem Wegtraum. Es handelt sich um Strassen und ihre Abkürzungen, die ich finden muss. Die Doktorarbeit spielt da hinein: Ich habe Szilasi in einer Gesellschaft getroffen. Er hat mir Anweisungen für die Arbeit gegeben, die ich ausführen muss. Damit wohl auch die Etymologie am Anfang in Zusammenhang. Das Wesentliche an ihr war, dass sie nicht komisch wirkte, sondern von tiefernster leiblicher Notwendigkeit war, obwohl das Komische an ihr auch im Traum erkennbar war -- aber als ein Moment der Faszination.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0957 (1952-07-14 - Freiburg)In einer psychologischen Gesellschaft -- etwa wie ein Seminar, aber lockerer. Neben mir sitzt ein Mädchen mit zartem, etwas verspieltem Gesicht. Schmale Nase. Sie nimmt eine Handschrift, die vor mir liegt, und beginnt mit Farben etwas um die Buchstaben herum zu malen. Ich bestrafe sie, indem ich sie am Kopf ergreife und den Kopf ein Stück zu mir herziehe, dann aber ganz leicht einen Kuss darauf drücke. Inzwischen zieht jemand anders mir eine Handschrift von Ika, die im Couvert vor mir liegt, heimlich fort. Ich packe aber noch das Papier und halte es fest, da ich nicht will, dass jeder, dem es einfällt, den Inhalt lesen kann. Im Aufschauen erkenne ich den Psychologen Jolas und lasse ihm die Schrift, da ich weiss, dass er sie nur graphologisch betrachtet. Er malt nun allerhand Figuren aus der Schrift an die Tafel, die alle einen strahlenförmigen Ausgang um einen konzentrischen Mittelpunkt zeigen und weist darauf hin, dass hier das sonnenförmige Muster der Nadelschälchen wiederkehrt. Andere Szene: Noch in der Gesellschaft. Es ist über das schmale Mädchen die Rede, die man nicht mag, weil sie zuviel Belangloses herumredet und herumdeutet. Dann darüber, dass die Psychologinnen ihren Stier haben müssen. Gemeint ist offenbar ein grosser Boss, der das Volk beherrscht. (205 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0958 (1952-07-14 - Freiburg)Ich habe mir Arbeit gesucht, und zwar hat Ernst Jünger mir den Auftrag gegeben, die Ilias zu übersetzen. Ich spreche mit irgend einem Sekretär darüber, der mich fragt, warum dies nicht Armin Mohler (Jüngers Sekretär), den er offenbar kennt, tue. Szenenwechsel: Ich spreche nun mit Armin Mohler selbst in Jüngers Haus, das aber in der Räumlichkeit dem Benderschen Institut gleicht. Er meint in einer Sache, ich solle Jünger ruhig selber deswegen ansprechen, am besten auf dem Flur oder in der Küche. Es ist offenbar -- wie bei Bender -- eine kleine zwischen die Arbeitsräume eingeschaltete Küche. Dort wo es am wenigsten feierlich sei, werde es ihn am wenigsten stören. Es handelt sich um nun eine andere Arbeit. Quader aus einem durchsichtigen Stoff gleich Eis, die mit Bleifassungen je an den Kanten der Würfel in kleine Würfel eingeteilt sind. Ein Mittel, offenbar zur Abwehr des Krebs, das man in der Stube aufstellt wie einen elektrischen Ofen. Um die Herstellung dieses Mittels handelt es sich. Mohler bittet mich auch, in Freiburg zu erforschen, ob das Mittel gegen Krebs überhaupt etwas nütze. Ich betrachte die Machart und stelle fest, dass das Bleigerüst nur sozusagen perspektivisch in den Eisquader eingelassen ist, das heisst, es sitzt nur oberflächlich dran und erzeugt den Eindruck der Tiefe durch raffinierte Verkürzungen. Das Bleigerüst müsste den ganzen Block durchziehen. Statt dessen ist das Gerüst fast flächig und stellt nur die Perspektive der Würfel dar. Ich ertaste die Linien, die anders und raffinierter sind als hier in der Zeichnung, unter der Oberfläche und bin begeistert über die perspektivische Vereinigung. (Neben dem Text eine Zeichnung des Würfels). (266 words)

Er war ungefährlich, doch hatte man Angst, seine Augen zu verletzen. Es war eine Gesellschaft von Menschen in dem Raum, an dessen Tür er wohl stand. Dann von Marion. Sie übernachtete in dem Raum unter einem Schrank Die Verzierungen am Rande gingen aber so tief an den Boden, dass ich mit meinem Kopf nicht darunter durch kam, und erstaunt war, wie Marion das dank ihrer zarten Gestalt geschafft hatte. Dann lagen wir aber doch irgendwie nebeneinander und sprachen zusammen. Wenn ich ihren nackten Körper berührte -- sie trug nur einen Badeanzug, was ich erst jetzt merkte -- zuckte sie zusammen und wehrte sich. Doch war es nicht Peter, sondern ein anderer Mann, an den sie sich gebunden fühlte. Dann von Gisela. Ich besuchte sie in aller Morgenfrühe, weil ich mich plötzlich dorthingezogen fühlte, und fand sie schon im Hausflur, sprechend mit einer Frau, von der sie sich dann trennte. Ich erklärte, während wir über den Hof gingen, ein Spaziergang habe mich hierher geführt. Andere Szene. Besteigung eines Berges im Mittelgebirge, der der Brocken heisst. Er ragt sehr unmittelbar und wie ein Felsturm aus dem Flachland auf, ist auch wie ein Turm in der Landkarte eingetragen. Wir steigen zuvor auf Aussichtstürme und andere hohe Punkte, so dass in dem Aufstieg zum Berg eine Steigerung liegt. Mein Begleiter scheint Züge und Art von Marion zu tragen. Auf einem der Türme -- ihre Stube ist anscheinend über der meinen -- ist ein Balkon, den sie nicht betritt, wegen seiner Glätte und des schmalen Randes. Man sieht von der Tür aus den Berg mit seiner aufragenden Felssäule. Ich rate ihr, nicht zu ängstlich mit dem Balkon zu sein. Ein Kind geht herauf, kommt aber schon gefährlich nahe an den Rand.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0962 (1952-07-18 - Freiburg)Ich erzähle einem Besuch im Käfig, dass mir die vielen Bilder in dem kleinen Raum in Zeiten der Überanstrengung zuweilen zu viel würden. Ich nähme dann alle weg und liesse nur die kahlen Wände übrig, um mich zu erholen. Andere Szene: Betrachten von Bildreproduktionen -- mit einem Maler. Ich suche aus dem grossen Buch alle Picasso-Bilder heraus. Zuletzt sehe ich eine Kutsche im heitersten Barockstil auf einem Bild, das sogar schwer als Photographie oder Reproduktion eines Gemäldes zu identifizieren ist. Bei näherem Betrachten des Bildes merken wir, dass es sich um einen einfachen flachen Arbeitswagen handelt, in den die Leute eine im barocken Schwung gebogene Leiter so hineingesetzt haben, dass er das Bild einer Barockkarosse gibt. Vorne sass der Kutscher, hinten im Wagen lag ein Zylinderhut. Es schien eine dörflich improvisierte Hochzeitskutsche zu sein. Nächste Szene. Ich fahre in einem Wagen von der Arbeit heim. Vorne sitzt der Kutscher. Dort, wo wir aussteigen müssen, kommt das Pferd nur schwer zum Stehen. Es läuft noch ein Stückchen zu weit. Er lässt es darum -- gleichsam zur Erziehung -- mit dem Wagen ein Stück rückwärts gehen, zu meinem Erstaunen, ohne dabei den Bordstein zu schrammen. Er beherrscht die Zügel in der Lenkung nach rechts und links auch beim Rückwärtskutschieren gut. Da das Pferd aber zunächst dann beim Anhalten wieder erst ein Stückchen vorwärts läuft, wiederholt sich das Manöver noch einige Male. Dann beim Aussteigen stelle ich fest, dass meine Decke, die ich auf dem Schoss habe, vorne bis zum Pferd reicht, eingeklemmt unter dem Sattel, und von dort bis zum Wagen gleichsam wie ein zweiter Zügel. Ich frage den Kutscher, ob das so sein müsse. Er verneint und kann nicht verstehen, wie sich meine Decke da vorne eingeklemmt haben könne. Während ich sie unter dem Sattel herausziehe, stützt sich das Pferd, das müde geworden ist, mit seinem ganzen Gewicht auf mich und scheint einzuschlafen. Ich kann es nur schwer bewegen, sein Gewicht von mir zu nehmen, erwache mit dem Gedanken, wie es wäre, wenn wir nun beide einschlafen und das Pferd sich dann über mich legen würde. Nächster Gedanke, dass man die Hufeisen entfernen müsste, damit es beim Aufstehen mich nicht verletzen könne. (361 words)

Die Münze lag offenbar auf einer Strasse in der Nähe eines Flugplatzes (wie etwa die Autobahn beim Rhein-Main-Flughafen in Frankfurt, die dort niedrig von aufsteigenden Flugzeugen überquert wird). Nächste Szene: Ich sehe im Flugzeug, wie dem Piloten am Höhenmesser Anweisungen gegeben werden zum Überqueren der Strasse. Der Höhenmesser zeigt zuvor 30 Meter. Er muss dann heraufziehen auf 50 Meter -- über der Strasse, danach aber wieder herabrücken auf 30 Meter, sogar auf 25 Meter zu gehen versuchen, um 30 Meter zu erreichen, um damit in den Sog zu kommen, der das Flugzeug im Anstieg steil hinaufreisst. Ich sehe das Flugzeug sehr schnell hochsteigen, das heisst, ich bin selbst im Flugzeug. Drinnen ist es gemütlich -- anscheinend ohne Sicherungsmassnahmen. Eine Frau hält ihr gelbes Tuch aus dem Fenster, lässt es wehen und sagt wohl: "Was wäre, wenn ich es jetzt losliesse?" Man ermuntert sie dazu. Sie lässt es los, und es fliegt zunächst in unermessliche Höhen, dann allmählich immer tiefer sinkend. Ich sehe den Vorgang nun als Film. Man sieht über dem Erdboden das Tuch ankommen. Ich sehe viele einzelne gelbe Stücke -- denke zunächst, das Tuch sei zerrissen, merke dann aber ,dass es fallende Herbstblätter sind, zwischen denen das Tuch fliegt. Andere Szene: Mangelhaft bekleidete Menschen in einer Badeanstalt, auch eine alte Frau, die anscheinend auf das ankommende Tuch warten. Andere Szenen: Krieg. Männer, wohl Abgestürzte aus einem Flugzeug (es ist immer noch filmmässig) werden aus dem Wasser gefischt. (Noch Szenerie der Badeanstalt). Einer von den Gefischten (in Uniform) wirft einen anderen (in Zivil), offenbar einen Intriganten, wieder ins Wasser. Ich gehe nun selbst mit auf den Steg und spüre, wie der Hineingeworfenen von unten an den Steg herankommt. Andere Szene: Im Abort. Ich suche eine Rinne, in die man hineinschiffen kann. Andere Szene: Schwimmhosen in Dreiecksform. Es gibt blaue, rote, weisse, gelbe und gelborangene. Ich wähle die orange-gelbe. (342 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0968 (1952-07-23 - Freiburg)Haus mit kleinen Zimmern, steigenden Korridoren, da wohnt die Grossherzogin -- ein wenig höher als ein armer Bauer -- eine Ecke des Korridors, wo man nie hinkommt. Als ich einmal dort hingelange, und seine Türe offensteht, sehe ich das Zimmer voller Bilder der Fürstin. Sie lebt mit ihm. Grosser tiefschwarzer Schäferhund -- sehr edel. Ich berühre seinen Kopf, schliesse Freundschaft mit ihm, bin beglückt, endlich ein edles Tier gefunden zu haben. Am Münster: eine sehr leger bekleidete Frau mit nacktem Bauch und Rücken, nur die Brüste und die Scham sind bedeckt, zeigt das Bauwerk. Sie erklärt die Biegung der Strebungen, die übrigens nicht ganz exakt sei, so dass die Portale und Fenster auf beiden Seiten nicht genau gegenüber liegen. Übrigens sah man vorher das Münster von ferne. Eine Stimme fordert zur Betrachtung. Jedoch solle man die Einheiten, die nicht zusammengehören, für sich betrachten. Die Frau zeigt eine merkwürdige Mischung von Frömmigkeit und geschlechtlicher Leidenschaft. Wir umarmen uns und liegen zusammen nieder. Doch als ich zur letzten Vereinigung fortschreiten will, zieht sie die Knie an und wehrt sich. Ich habe gespürt, wie bei mir ein Moment des Erschlaffens unsere feine Bindung zerstört hat. Dann die Gestalt eines Arztes und zugleich Priesters. Er gilt als sonderbar. Ich sehe ihn mit Talar und Barett. Kann aber zuweilen auf seinen Namen nicht kommen. Meine zuweilen, es sei Hattingberg. Plötzlich fällt mir aber ein, er heisst Paal. Er gehört auch irgendwie zu dem merkwürdigen Haus, in dem die Grossherzogin wohnt. (245 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0969 (1952-07-24 - Freiburg)Besuch bei meiner Schwester Adelheid. Sie hat eine kellerartige Wohnung. Verschieden hoch liegende Räume. Einige mehr holzartig, andere mit Steinfussboden. Ich versuche, die Lage der Zimmer zueinander und ihre Zahl mir klarzumachen. Meine Nichte Sigrid ist da und spielt in dem Traum eine Rolle. Dann ist da eine Drogerie Kern, wo der Besitzer gestorben ist. Die Leute haben seine Embleme an eine Pyramide aus Seife gemacht -- aber achtlos, sie haben schlechte Seife genommen. (74 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0970 (1952-07-25 - Freiburg)Hf.s neue Freundin (die ich gestern kennenlernte), kommt zu Besuch. Ich erwarte sie aus einem Grund, den ich jetzt vergessen habe. Hf. kommt gerade zu mir. Er steht noch jenseits der Tür und wir unterhalten uns durch die geschlossene Tür. Hf. sagt: "Wer ist da?" Ich sage: "Eine Freundin", in dem Moment vergessend, das diese ja seine Freundin ist. Öffne die Tür. Hf. sagt: "Ihre Voraussagen scheinen ungenau zu sein". Er hat also gar nichts gemerkt. Es ist alles wie bei der ersten schweren Identifikation der Umwelt nach dem Erwachen. Andere Szene: Ika ist bei mir zu Besuch. Wir bereiten ein Essen, sind beim Pellen der Kartoffeln. An einem Tisch sitzend. Ich komme ihr dabei näher und wir umarmen uns. Es ist ein sehr glückliches Wiedersehen. Dieter ist auch da. Wir besprechen etwas. (133 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0971 (1952-07-26 - Freiburg)Zunächst Traum von Dolo. Dann von Peter, aber in der Rolle Dieters in Wittmoldt. Er hatte sich mit Billes Mutter aus Wittmoldt gestritten. Ich merkte dies daran, dass ich beide, erst ihn, dann sie, beleidigt mit ihrem Teller im Nebenzimmer sah. Jeder beklagte sich über den anderen. Bei Tisch führte jedoch mein Vater das Präsidium, und es war nicht Wittmoldt, sondern der runde Esstisch meines Elternhauses. Auch das Nebenzimmer war wie zu Hause in Schwerin. Billes Mutter aus Wittmoldt beklagte sich nun bei Tisch über Peter, der nebenan sass, und hatte den Vorzug der Autorität des Alters für sich, den mein Vater bei Tisch pflegte. Ich verteidigte aber trotzdem Peter. Er hatte sich in einer Kirche durch Wendeltreppen zum Orgelspielen zurückgezogen. Die steinerne Wendeltreppe im Gehäuse erinnerte an den Schweriner Dom.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0972 (1952-07-28 - Freiburg)Komplizierte und versponnene Traumgefüge, aus denen ich nur noch Bruchstücke eruieren kann. So musste Trudel ein Telefongespräch führen, in dem es um ihre Berufsfrage ging. Sie wählte zwar die Nummer, sprach dann aber nichts herein, sondern sass schweigend mit dem Hörer da. Ich versuchte, ihr klarzumachen, dass das nicht ginge, sie antwortete mir auch, so dass der Gesprächspartner drüben ihre Worte hören musste, begann aber trotzdem kein Gespräch mit ihm. Im übrigen war in den Teilen des Traums, die um Trudel gingen, eine Mittelpunkts-bezogene Bewegung, wie auf einer barocken Szenerie, das heisst, geradeaus, aber rechts und links was rechter und linker Hand war, kam irgendwie feierlich mit. Es ist dies ein ganz bestimmtes Raumgefühl, das man etwa beim Menuett-Tanzen hat. Andere Szene spielt um einen Hund, der aber wohl im Anfang ein Mensch war. Der Hund begleitet mich, ich habe ihn an einer langen Leine. Später steige ich in einen Wagen ein, die Leine in der Hand, die Türe wird zugeschlagen, der Wagen setzt sich in Bewegung, der Hund ist draussen geblieben, läuft mit, springt aufs Trittbrett, so dass ich ihn während der Fahrt nicht mehr hereinlassen kann, da die Türe nach aussen aufgeht. Ich habe grosse Angst, er könne bei der hohen Geschwindigkeit herabfallen. Am Schluss, der Hund ist nicht gefallen, gehe ich in die Nähe seines Hauses, und der Hund findet alleine den Weg zurück.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0973 (1952-07-30, 04:00 - Freiburg)Traum von Bender, Szilasi, Ferber und Gisela, und zwar: 1. Besprechung mit Bender über Traumstrukturen. Bender nervös und abgearbeitet. Ich wiederhole energisch und etwas betont meine Worte über die Geographie des Traumes. Habe hinterher das Gefühl, etwas zu weit gegangen zu sein. Nächste Szene: Zu Besuch bei Szilasi: Er hat in der letzten Seminarsitzung ein Buch von einem Italiener ausgegeben, in dem amüsante Geschichten gesammelt sind, darunter eine Anekdote von einem Herrn Schilanschmi. Er amüsiert sich über diese kleine Anspielung sehr. Wir sind bei ihm zum Essen eingeladen, doch kommt er über Gespräche und Beschäftigung mit dem Buch nicht zum Essen. Er hebt dann plötzlich die Tafel auf und verabschiedet sich, noch ehe die anderen Seminarteilnehmer gekommen sind. Ich gehe draussen noch einmal aufs Klo. Als ich gerade in die Tür gehen will, begegnet mir Frau Szilasi noch einmal und winkt mir zu. Es hat geklingelt und sie eilt, um aufzumachen, und erzählt mir: "Ich muss schnell aufmachen." Das Klingeln ist ihr nämlich das Wichtigste. Dann gehe ich durch die Stadt und komme auf die Idee, Krischan zu besuchen, den ich lange nicht gesehen habe. Doch fällt mir seine Adresse nicht mehr ein. Ich höre jedoch plötzlich Frauen und alte Leute im obersten Stock eines Hauses davon reden. Es ist eine Gegend mit einfachen und armen Häusern. Ich rufe der Frau von der Strasse zu, ob sie Ferbers Adresse wüsste. Nach einer Besinnung und Rücksprache mit ihrem Mann ruft sie herab: "Oberstrasse 25". Ich mache mich nun auf den Weg, komme dabei in die Uni und treffe im Treppenhaus Gisela in Begleitung eines ganz leicht angezogenen, nur um die Lenden in einen Spitzensschleier gehüllten, Mädchens, offenbar einer Musikerin. Auch Gisela trägt nur eine Badehose. Wir grüssen uns flüchtig, doch hat mich die Begegnung so erregt, dass ich in meiner Jackentasche nach einer Zigarette suche, die Dieter dort gestern hineingesteckt hat, die allerdings schon ein bisschen angebrochen ist, und bitte mir Feuer von einem Komilitonen. Es ist de Philosophie-Student Müller. Er begleitet mich auf die Strasse, wir hören eine Geige mit wunderbarem Ton, ich weise entzückt hinauf und sehe oben im Fenster Gisela sitzen, die mich mit strahlenden Augen ansieht. Wir sprechen ein paar Worte miteinander, und ich werfe ihr die Zigarette hinauf. Die angebrochene brennende geht jetzt doch zu kurz. Sie kann sie nicht fangen, aber dabei finde ich noch eine ganze unangebrauchte frische, die gleichsam spielend hinauffliegt, so dass Gisela sie fängt. Ich bin unendlich beglückt von den strahlenden Augen und erwache mit ihrem Bild. (Zunächst versuche ich, den Traum in der Erinnerung zu rekapitulieren, bis er dem Wachbewusstsein standhält. Als ich die Augen aufschlage, fällt mir ein, dass Gisela heute Morgen um fünf Uhr zur Baumgärtnerin hier im Haus kommen wollte, wie Elisabeth Baumgarten gestern sagte, schaue nach der Uhr. Es ist zehn nach vier, und ich habe das bestimmte Gefühl, dass Gisela jetzt erwacht). (477 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0974 (1952-07-30 - Freiburg)Beerdigung des Grossvaters. Dabei merkwürdige Requisiten, zum Beispiel unser Onyx-Tisch, doch auf Wunsch des Grossvaters prunkvoll umgearbeitet und überladen mit Messingkränzen verziert. Dann Holzschnitzereien. Emmi ist da, sehr hingebend und voller leidenschaftlicher Liebe, doch zu Tränen neigend. Wir küssen uns. Als der Sarg hinaus getragen wird, kommt zu meinen Erstaunen noch ein anderer hinein, aus dem ein Mann Muscheln herausnimmt, aus denen er die Zukunft deutet. Ich nehme das nicht sehr ernst, spreche während dessen durch das Fenster mit der Baumgärtnerin, die mit dem Glockenspiel geläutet hat. Dann kommen viele Mädchen, die sich leidenschaftlich küssen, zuletzt Französinnen mit schwarzen Augen und Haaren und dunkler Haut, die noch leidenschaftlicher sind als die anderen, aber sagen: "Wir sind die Letzten." Es scheint Krieg zu drohen. Dann kommen Russinnen, kühle Gesichter, aber von heisser Glut, die sofort ihre Brüste enthüllen. Die erste ist von einem Ausschlag entstellt, doch andere haben eine sehr reine und schöne Haut, doch tragen sie auf der Brust eine Wunde. Zuletzt eine Russin, die ich umarmen will, doch da bricht auch zwischen ihren Brüsten eine Wunde auf, die beginnt zu bluten, von der ich nichts gewusst hatte. (188 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0975 (1952-07-31 - Freiburg)Gespräch mit Heidegger über ein Buch von ihm, in dem die Gedanken von Sein und Zeit gedichtet sind zu Bildern, die aber Schritt für Schritt der Gedankenführung von "Sein und Zeit" entsprechen. Er prüft im Durchblättern des Buches diese Entsprechung. Es beginnt mit dem Bild von einem Chauffeur des Todes mit dem Namen Mario oder Reimarion oder ähnlich, den er sprachgeschichtlich als Begleiter des Todes erklärt. Am Ende des Gesprächs frage ich ihn, ob in dem Film der Doppeladler der Gedanke, dass beide nur zusammen sterben können, bedeute, dass die Sterblichen ihren Tod vermögen. Er bejaht. Dabei ist es im Traum so, dass ich annehme, dieser Film sei von Heidegger. Heidegger sucht dann eine Arbeit von mir, die er für eine Veröffentlichung einschicken könne. Dann erinnert er sich, dass er schon etwas habe und findet in einem grossen Sammelband, in dem er ihm eingeschickte Arbeiten zusammengefügt hat, meine Doktorarbeit, jedoch wieder in dichterischer Form. Andere Traumszene: Fahrt mit Gregor in ein Industriegebiet, wo ich an bestimmter Stelle aussteigen muss. Die Beschäftigung dort hängt irgendwie mit dem Heidegger-Gespräch zusammen. Andere Szene: Dort im Industriegebiet auf einem Abort, der keine Zellen hat. (190 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0976 (1952-08-08 - Freiburg)Traum von einem Haus, in dem Adolf Hitler wohnte und in welchem ich die letzten Tage des Krieges mit ihm erlebte. Er war jedoch ein sehr fein differenzierter und bedeutender Mann, etwa von der Physiognomie wie Ernst Jünger oder Bender. Das Haus war sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und voller seltener und magischer Gegenstände, etwa wie die Einrichtung im Hause des Orphée. Ich erlebte die Szene selbst anwesend, doch zugleich wie den Bericht zweier kleiner englischer Mädchen, die in jenen Tagen dort gewesen waren, oder wie einen Film. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0977 (1952-08-12 - Freiburg)[Im Haus "Erasmus".] Ich werde beschuldigt, einen Federhalter gestohlen zu haben und zwar: erste Szene: Jemand steckt mir irgendwo einen zweiten Federhalter neben den meinen vorne in die Jackentasche. Ich wundere mich, vergesse dann aber während des Ganges durch die Stadt den Vorgang. Während des Überquerens in Begleitung zweier männlicher Bekannter, hält mich ein Polizist an, fordert meine Papiere und tut zunächst in ironischer Weise sehr freundlich, zieht aber den zweiten Federhalter aus meiner Tasche und sagt: "Was machen Sie mit zwei Füllfederhaltern, wo haben Sie den zweiten gestohlen?" Ich erwidere, ich habe ihn nicht gestohlen, dafür könne ich Zeugen bringen (die beiden Herren, die schon die Strasse überquert und den Bürgersteig betreten haben), denke aber dabei, dass es nicht sicher ist, ob sie den ersten Vorgang beobachtet haben.

Einmal ging ich nicht pünktlich zum Essen herunter, obwohl das eigentlich nicht nötig gewesen wäre. Ich wartete auf ein Glockenzeichen. Dann schwebte ich jedoch die Treppe hinunter, ohne sie mit den Füssen zu berühren, nur jeweils an den Treppenabsätzen mich mit der Hand an den Pfeilern abstossend und wendend. So kam ich noch pünktlich. (70 words)

Es handelte sich jedoch nicht um ein einzelnes Schloss, sondern um einen grossen Komplex, wo Landwirtschaft, Industrie und Wohnung burgartig, jedoch hochelegant ineinander übergehen. Der Mann, der sehr geistig und aristokratisch aussieht, ist dauernd woanders, einmal in diesem, einmal in jenem Raum. Die Kinder, die ich zu unterrichten habe, zwei Mädchen, etwa um 14 Jahre, sind sehr nett und frei in ihrem Wesen. Die Frau ist in ihrer Art ganz auf den Mann eingestellt. Es gibt Sekt. Ich soll die Flaschen öffnen, zugleich jedoch eine Flasche Sprudel. Beim Eindrehen des Korkenziehers zerbricht der Korken. Ich kann ihn jedoch aus dem Flaschenhals hinausgraben, sehr besorgt, kein Stück hineinfallen zu lassen. Doch als er hinaus ist, ist die Flasche nur voll trockenem Pulver. Ich denke: Aha: Henkell Trocken. Da wird also der Sprudel heraufgegossen. Die Grosszügigkeit der Umgebung und der ganzen Atmosphäre beglückt mich sehr. (146 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0987 (1952-08-19 - Freiburg)Träume aus der Schulzeit. Zunächst eine Art tänzerisches Rezitativ. Vortragen eines Textes mit chorischen Bewegungen, die jedoch eher an Menuett oder Volkstanz erinnern. Zu meinem Erstaunen werde ich gelobt und soll das kaum Erlernte auf einer Bühne vorführen. Dann Biologie-Unterricht. Schwierige Rechnungen, anscheinend klimabiologischer Art, die mir undurchschaubar scheinen, da das Wesentliche nicht erklärt, sondern nur die Technik der Vergleichung dargestellt wird. Um das Ende der Stunde gehen die Schüler selbständig fort. Der Lehrer bleibt schliesslich etwas ratlos zurück. Er hat ein Pferdchen in eine Art Wasser gesetzt. Es hat eine Kette um den Hals. Ich sage zu dem Lehrer beim Hinausgehen: "Vorsicht, dass sich das Tierchen nicht drosselt" (wollte zunächst sagen: "würgt"). Dann Turnen mit Emmi. Gemeinsame boden-gymnastische Übungen, bei denen wir körperlich aufeinander ansprechen. Dann macht sie artistische Dinge auf dem Barren. Macht dann eine Bauchlandung, wobei sie sich an einem tiefliegenden Holm verletzt. Das Ganze vollzieht sich lautlos. Andere Szene: Auf einem Hof (wie dem Lilienhof, zugleich Atmosphäre wie im Hotel Erasmus), zeige ich einem Gast die Garagen des Betriebes, die grossen Weinverarbeitungsbehälter, nach denen er mich fragt, und die ebenfalls, wie die Garagen, in den Felsen eingelassen sind. Andere Szene: Gang mit Schulfreunden durch den Wald. Eine Kuh galoppiert zwischen der Herde auf der Koppel, plötzlich entdecken wir, es ist ein Bulle. Er setzt im Sprung über den Zaun. Wir machen uns bereit, auf die Bäume zu klettern, da wir ihm im Lauf nicht mehr entrinnen können. Er bleibt jedoch wie tot oder besoffen hinter uns im Wald liegen. (253 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0988 (1952-08-21 - Freiburg)Mit Vater in einem Raum, der unserem Schweriner Esszimmer glich. Rechts und links des Fensters hängen sehr schöne schmale Perserteppiche an der Wand, rot und blau, doch in einer Anordnung, die nicht glücklich ist. Ich schlage eine andere, mehr symmetrische Anordnung vor, die die roten und schöneren mehr heraushebt. Vater ist entzückt. Dann folgende Szene: Von der Truhe links neben dem Esstisch, auf der Messing- und Bronzegeschirr steht, kommt ein kleines Bronzemännchen herunter. Vater, der an seinem Schreibtisch ist: "Jetzt holt er sich den Fingerkumt." Das Männchen holt sich in der Tat vom Esstisch das Wasserschälchen, klettert damit, ohne etwas zu vergiessen, wieder auf die hohe Truhe und verschwindet hinten. Es hat eine bronzefarbene Haut an seinem nackten Körper, wirkt schwer wie aus Metall, doch sehr geschickt. Vater sagt, es seien Lilliputaner, die schon lange hier lebten. Ich denke darüber nach, ob sie aus Fleisch oder Metall seien, ob Menschen oder Tiere, ob sie zum Beispiel der Sprache kundig oder nicht. Doch überrascht mich seine menschenartig bewusste Geschicklichkeit, mit der er die Schale so hielt, dass kein Wasser hinauslaufen konnte, was eigentlich ein direktes Ding-Bewusstsein von der Schale voraussetzte. Diese Überlegungen waren schon halb im Erwachen. Dann andere Szene, in der beide Eltern nacheinander tot, in einem kleinen Dachstübchen in Wittmoldt, dann aber doch wieder leben, als wären sie nur scheintot gewesen. (222 words)

Andere Szene: Gemüseverkauf vor einem Gemüseladen. Ein grober Mann will Kartoffeln kaufen. Trägt mir Homosexualität an. Ich wehre ihn gewaltsam ab, rufe Polizei, die vorbeikommt, doch sie nehmen mich nicht ernst. (71 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0990 (1952-08-23 - Freiburg)Schwierige Portieraufgaben. Ich habe die Portiersdienste an zwei Hotels gleichzeitig übernommen, die in zwei aufeinanderfolgenden Querstrassen liegen, welche sich aber in U-Form hinten treffen. Ich habe vergessen, wie die Dienstzeiten bei den einzelnen festgesetzt sind. Die Arbeit droht mir ineinander zu fliessen und meine ganze Zeit in Anspruch zu nehmen. Dann mit einem Gärtner auf einem Fluss, auf oder an dem ich etwas transportieren soll. Die Schwierigkeit ist wieder so, dass zwei Gartenbetriebe flussaufwärts in ihren Funktionen ineinander gehen. Ich finde das geeignete Fahrzeug nicht. Die obere Gärtnerei gehört anscheinend der Polizei. Ein Mann, den sie den Hauptfeldwebel nennen, und den ich anspreche, ist sehr freundlich und stellt mir ein Schiff zur Verfügung. Andere Szene: Auch auf dem Lande: Einer der Leute sagt, am Esstisch im Gutshaus stehend,: "Frau v. Oertzen hat zwanzig Tischbeine", dabei ein Glas mit Nachdruck so auf den Platz über einem Tischbein setzend, dass man begreift: Sie kann zwanzig Gäste beherbergen. Ich ergänze im Spass: "Und zwei Menschenbeine". Er ist verärgert, denn sein Ausdruck war ernst und sogar etwas feierlich gemeint. Die Szene ist jetzt eine Küche, in der unsere Emmi kocht. Ich will ein Ei zubereiten, habe aber so unglücklich damit angestossen, dass es viele Risse bekommen hat und ich es gerade noch in die Pfanne schlagen kann. Das Ei hat um das Gelb herum harte körnig gelbe Schalen, als wäre es dort schon hart gekocht. Der Mann, der vorher von den Tischbeinen sprach, warnt mich: "Das kannst Du nicht essen -- das ist der Mantel, den haben die Eier jetzt, weil die Hühner viel Korn fressen, das sie nicht verdauen". Andere Traumszene: Ich habe eine Schmalfilmkamera, mit der ich auf der Strasse Szenen rein nach aesthetischen und photographischen Gesichtspunkten filme, ohne inhaltliche Absichten. Dies gelingt mir sehr gut, doch verstehe ich wenig von Belichtung und Technik. (302 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0991 (1952-08-24 - Freiburg)Traum von Marion. Ich trage sie auf meinen Armen durch den Raum und küsse sie. Schliesslich lege ich sie dabei auf meinem weiss bezogenen Bett nieder. Sie schlägt die Augen auf, doch als sie begreift, dass es mein Bett ist, springt sie mit einem leichten eleganten Sprung auf und das Spiel beginnt von neuem. Andere Szene: Auf der Suche nach dem Käfig. Ich muss dazu durch einen grossen, hoch gebauten Saal, der völlig zerstört ist, ähnlich dem oberen Hörsaal der Universität. Sehe ganz oben in einem Giebel den Käfig noch unversehrt schweben -- gehe über Leitern, die brüchig sind, hinauf, hinab durch leimartig weisse Flüssigkeit am Boden, und so fort, bis ich schliesslich im Käfig bin. Dann andere Szene: Die Hausmeistersfrau zeigt mir einen besseren Weg in den Käfig: Durch den ganz linken Flügel. Es ist sehr kompliziert. Das Gebäude ist konzentrisch gebaut. Der Käfig sitzt am obersten Scheitelpunkt. Die Treppen und Gänge sind verwirrt. Schliesslich ende ich wieder vor einer zerstörten Treppe, wo eine Fülle von Studenten wie in einer Hungersnot wartend sitzt. Ich bin sehr elend. Ein rührender Student stärkt mich mit Sahnebonbons. Dann andere Szene: Ich war wohl inzwischen wieder in dem Käfig gelandet. Das Gebäude jetzt schlossartig wie der Dresdener Zwinger. Der Käfig konzentrisch unter der höchsten Kuppel. Ein Aufruhr zwingt zur Flucht. An dem Platz vor dem Schloss springe ich auf den Bock einer schwarzen Kutsche zu einer schönen jungen Dame, die sich Katja oder ähnlich nennt. Ich könnte sie zeichnen, so lebhaft steht mir ihr Gesicht noch vor Augen. Sie kann gut kutschieren, und so entrinnen wir dem Pöbel, der uns zu Fuss, schwarze Gestalten mit kantigen Gesichtern, zeitweise so unmittelbar folgt, dass wir die Pferde zum Galopp antreiben müssen. Dann wieder andere Szene: Wieder vor dem schlossartigen Gebäude. Diesmal versuchen wir von aussen zu bestimmen, wo der Käfig liegt. Das Gebäude ist jetzt mit vier grossen Flügeln um den Hof gelagert, hat drei Stockwerke und unter den Kuppeln bis zu fünf. Überall sind Erker und Ausbauten. Es ist kaum möglich, den Käfig zu identifizieren. Die Baumgärtnerin hilft dabei. Wir gehen suchend um das Schloss herum, unter immer anderen Gesichtspunkten sehend. Das Gebäude gleicht jetzt einem Komplex wie das Berliner Schloss. Die Baumgärtnerin vermutet den Käfig jetzt genau auf der entgegengesetzten Seite und meint von einer Allee, deren Namen ich vergessen habe, könne man in die Fenster schauen. Doch auch, als wir das Schloss umwandert haben, das übrigens auch dem Schweriner Schloss ähnlich ist, können wir nicht die charakteristischen Fenster entdecken. Da fällt mir ein, dass ja das grosse Atelierfenster der Baumgärtnerin darunter sein müsse und es sich wahrscheinlich überhaupt um ein einzelnes Haus und nicht das Schloss handle. Die Baumgärtnerin besinnt sich nun und sagt, das Haus sei früher vom Schoss umschlossen gewesen, daher käme ihre Verwechslung. Wir vollenden nun in Urzeigerrichtung den Gang um das Schloss, so dass wir wieder an den Platz vor der grossen Kuppel gelangen. Dann wieder Szenenwechsel: Ich bin im Inneren des Schlosses in einer höfischen und zugleich mittelalterlich-katholischen Umgebung. Ein Novize muss aus der Bibel vorlesen. Eine vornehme in Schwarz gekleidete Dame kniet dabei. Ich knie ebenfalls nieder, da ich sehe, dass die Dame kniet. Ein untersetzter Mann in roter Kleidung von Aussehen und Tracht wie ein Medici-Fürst, von sehr rücksichtslosen und energischen Gesicht mit brauner Hautfarbe, hält dem Novizen die Bibel. Dieser liest nur stockend und verwirrt. Da schlägt der rote Mann, der eine grosse Befehlsgewalt hat, ihm das Buch zu und geht fort. Ich springe nun empört, da das Evangelium mitten abgebrochen ist, dem roten Fürsten, der ein Priester ist, nach und schleudere ihm die Worte entgegen: "Sie sind verpflichtet, uns das Evangelium zu lesen. Wir wollen das Wort von Ihnen hören." Er ist zunächst frappiert und bleibt zögernd stehen. Die Landsknechte, die in der Tracht wie Dürer sie gemalt hat, mit enganliegenden Hosen, zu Reihen im Saal stehen, beginnen aufzubegehren. Man sieht die Geisseln, die sie in die Händen tragen, zucken. Der Rote wendet die Situation zu seinen Gunsten, indem er zu ihnen sagt: "Ihr könnt machen mit ihm, was ihr wollt", und fortgeht. Sie werfen ihre Dolche mit elfenbeinernen Griffen nach mir. Doch kann ich den meisten ausweichen, andere mit einem kleinen Messingschild, nicht grösser als ein kleiner Spiegel, abwehren und die, die mich am Kopf treffen, scheinen mich nicht zu berühren. Auch rufe ich, um die Masse zu bannen, dass Gottes Wort mich schützen würde, obwohl ich nicht mehr ganz daran glaube. Dann gelingt es mir, durch die grosse Flügeltür in den Nachbarsaal zu entweichen, aus dem ich hereingesprungen war, als ich dem roten Mann folgte. Dort drüben sind die Leute noch auf meiner Seite. Es gelingt mir, die grosse Flügeltür zu schliessen, und den Schlüssel abzuziehen. Die Tür zu zerstören wagen die Landsknechte anscheinend nicht. Ich jage nun in atemloser Flucht der Kammer des Mädchens zu, mit dem ich damals geflohen war, und deren Bild sich dauernd in meinem Inneren bewegt. Ich nenne sie jetzt Aglaia. Auf dem Lauf durch die Gänge komme ich wieder von aussen an dem Saal vorbei, in dem die erregten Landsknechte sind. Zu dem Gang führt eine Tür. Sie hören mich, öffnen und folgen mir auf den Fersen. Ich laufe nun mit äusserster Kraft und kann ihnen gerade noch entrinnen und das Mädchen erreichen. Erwachen mit sehr starkem Herzklopfen. Die Mädchengestalt bleibt sich durch alle drei Figuren Marion, Katja, Aglaia verwandt. Auch das Schloss, Universität, Zwinger, Carrégebäude. (901 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0994 (1952-08-27 - Freiburg)Besuch von Ika. Andere Szene: In einem Gasthaus jenseits der Grenze, in dem die Menschen nichts essen, sondern nur tatenlos an den Tischen sitzen. Es ist eine drückende Atmosphäre. Andere Szene: In einem Zimmer, in dem ausser mir eine Studentin übernachtet. Zwei fahrende Jungen kommen noch dazu. Sie schickt sie jedoch beim Anziehen hinaus. (54 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0995 (1952-08-28 - Freiburg)Traum beim Vorbeifahren einer Maschine draussen. Zwei Mädchen schwingen im Kreise laufend jedes um eine Achse, sich an ihr mit dem Arm festhaltend, etwa wie Kinder, um einen Laternenpfahl. Beim Näherkommen der Maschine, von der ich aber im Traum nichts weiss noch höre, wird das Tempo des einen Kreises höher, das des anderen geringer. Im Erwachen höre ich die Maschinen gerade im Vorbeifahren und sehe noch, wie sich die Kreise des Traumbildes in ihrer Geschwindigkeit wieder ausgleichen, und begreife, dass sie in ihrer Tempoverschiebung die Verschiebung der Tonhöhe des Motorgeräusches des vorbeifahrenden Autos ausgedrückt haben, doch so, dass das Geräusch allein im Bild ausgedrückt war, ohne dass ich den Ton dazu im Traum hörte. Erst im Erwachen wurde mir die Zuordnung klar. (122 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0996 (1952-08-28 - Freiburg)Mein Vater ist Arzt. Mein Zimmer (in Schwerin) wird zugleich zur Abfertigung von Patienten benutzt. Ein ansteckend krankes Kind wird auf meinen Schreibtisch gelegt. Emmi (als Schwester) rafft schnell einige Blätter fort, die darunter liegen. Es sind Zeichnungen von Männlein, und sie knüllt sie zusammen, da sie sie nicht als solche erkannt hat. Ich schreibe hinterher einen Zettel: "Bitte keine ansteckenden Patienten in meinem Zimmer behandeln. Bitte nichts von meinem Schreibtisch nehmen." (72 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0997 (1952-06-28 - Freiburg)Morgens: "r areticat 28 dedicat 3." -- Traum von Gisela: In einem Krankenhaus. Ich höre sie Nachts in ihrem Zimmer jammern, gehe hinein und sehe, dass sie sich wie in Wehen windet. Ich beruhige sie und verspreche, sofort den Arzt zu holen. Der Arzt ist erschrocken. Es ist ja noch viel zu früh, da das Kind nach ihrer Angabe erst sechs Monate alt sein kann. Ich sage ihm jedoch, dass ich das Kind vor drei Monaten sehen konnte. Das wäre sehr unwahrscheinlich, wenn das Kind nicht schon älter wäre. Der Arzt strahlt auf: Das wäre eine Lösung. Wir biegen um die Ecke des Korridors, hinter der das Zimmer liegt, hören aber ausser Giselas Klagen jetzt schon die Stimmen anderer Ärzte im Zimmer. Er beschliesst daraufhin, schnell durch das Haustelephon im Zimmer anzurufen, um ihnen diese Möglichkeit zu sagen. Wir biegen um die nächste Ecke, wo der Apparat ist. Er weiss jedoch die Nummer nicht und bittet mich, sie schnell auf der Zimmertür zu lesen. Ich laufe dorthin und lese auf der Tür die Aufschrift" R Aret 28 det 3. "Laufe zum Arzt zurück und buchstabiere ihm das mühsam auswendig Gelernte. Er sagt: "Ja, Zimmer 28. Es heisst "r areticat 28 dedicat 3". Rufen Sie schnell an." Er geht fort. Ich nehme den Hörer ab und sehe mich nun vor der Aufgabe, meine Vermutung dem Arzt dort drinnen selber mitzuteilen. Es meldet sich eine Stimme aus der Vermittlung. Ich sage: "Ja bitte Zimmer r dedicat 28 areticat 3 oder umgekehrt, ich weiss nicht ganz genau." - "Ja", sagt es, "in dem Zimmer liegt niemand, da sind nur Kisten". Ich antworte: "Doch, das ist doch das Zimmer unten an der Ecke, da liegt jetzt eine Patientin." Mit Überlegungen, wie ich dem Arzt das Gedachte kurz sagen soll, erwache ich, und zwar mit dem Gefühl einer grossen glückhaften Geborgenheit, die aus dem Traumbewusstsein hervorgeht, dass das Kind nicht verloren ist, sondern geboren wird.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0998 (1952-08-28 - Freiburg)Basel. Gang durch einen Park. Hunde. Ich tue sehr selbstverständlich und freundlich zu ihnen, lasse mich von ihnen lecken. So beissen sie nicht. Eine Frau kassiert einen Franken für den Weg. In der Aufregung und mit den Hunden beschäftigt, gebe ich ihr automatisch, obwohl ich schon vorher bezahlt hatte. Nachher ist es dann schwierig, das Geld zurückzubekommen. Sie will bloss eine Quittung ausstellen für das nächste Mal. Ich brauche aber das Geld selbst, da ich nur zwei Franken für Basel habe. Andere Szene: In Norddeutschland auf einem kleinen Bahnhof. Ich bin auf einer Toilette, ziehe mein Portemonnaie und meine Uhr und sehe, dass ich weder genug Geld noch genug Zeit vor Abgang des Zuges dazu habe. Der Wärter, der gesehen hat, dass mein Portemonnaie leer ist, fordert mich auf, so herein zu gehen. Ich kann schlecht abschlagen und verzichte auf den Zug. Gehe durch einen Tunnel, dann eine Treppe hoch. Oben bin ich aber nur durch ein Geleise von meinem Zug getrennt, der gerade abfährt. Ich winke dem Wärter, springe herüber, um in der Fahrt aufzusteigen. Es ist ein Zug mit Dampflokomotive. Ich lasse mir ein wenig viel Zeit. Erst als der Zug schon ziemlich schnell fährt, springe ich auf einen modernen Wagen hinten. Der Beamte drinnen hilft mir herein. Ich stehe neben der Tür, die noch offen ist, und halte mich fest. Nach einer Weile bemerke ich, dass der Zug sich hier geteilt hat und mein Wagen als elektrischer Triebwagen fungiert. Ich bin zunächst besorgt, ob er auch das selbe Ziel erreicht, beruhige mich dann aber. Er fährt nur locker auf den Schienen, kann zuweilen ausweichen. Die Geschwindigkeit ist aber sehr gross, so dass es dazu oft nicht mehr langt. Man verlässt sich aber darauf, dass Fussgänger im, letzten Moment zur Seite springen, Fahrzeuge im letzten Moment ausweichen. So geht es bis nach Kiel. Anderer Traum: Auf einem ungarischen Gut. Mein Gastgeber, der mir zu Essen gab, trägt zwei schwere Krüge. Ich nehme sie ihm ab. Er sagt: "Zum Haus des Sportes". Alle Leute, die ich frage, sprechen nur ungarisch. So bleibe ich stecken. Einer trinkt mir mit rotem Wein zu, wobei er aber das zweite Glas parallel dem ersten mit erhebt, wie einen Zwillingslauf, ohne mir abzugeben. (369 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#0999 (1952-08-30 - Freiburg)Gisela lebt oben bei Bender, wo sie ihr Kind erwartet. Er ist sozusagen ihr Arzt. Ich treffe ihn unterwegs, während ich einen Eimer Wasser für sie hinauftrage. Er erinnerte mich im Vorbeigehen an das, was sie damit tun wolle (was ich jetzt vergessen habe). Ich antworte lächelnd, dass das, was sie geplant habe, noch lange nicht immer das sei, was sie nachher wirklich tue. Vorher andere Szene: die ich inhaltlich kaum noch erinnere. Wie in einem Hotel in Paris. Doch handelt es sich wohl dunkel auch um Trudel. (88 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1000 (1952-08-30 - Freiburg)Frau Mu. begegnet mir. Schwer beladen mit Koffer, Tasche, Netz, Mantel, was sie mir alles abgibt. Die Handtasche behält sie. Im Netz ist ein kleiner drachenartiger Schosshund mit riesigem Gebiss, der mich zu beissen sucht. Ich kann ihn mir jedoch mit Hilfe des Netzes leicht vom Leibe halten, und die Szene wirkt komisch. Frau Mu. hat seidene Strümpfe an, die an den Nähten verziert sind. Das sieht sehr amüsant aus. Andere Szene: Autobusse -- wohl militärischer Herkunft -- kommen in dichter Folge einen übersteilen Berg hoch, den ich hinabgehe. Ich kann ihnen nicht ausweichen, da sie sehr dicht an den Rand fahren müssen. Ich klemme mich in die äusserste Ecke und, da auch das nichts ist, gehe ich einfach über das Dach der Autobusse hinweg, was mir ein Leichtes ist, da der Berg so steil ist, dass ich von oben fast von selbst auf sie hinaufgleite. Dann sehe ich sie von unten. Der vorderste hat so schwer zu schaffen, dass er in Zickzacklinien, Serpentinen, fährt. Er gerät dabei so weit über die Kante, dass schon ein Hinterrad frei schwebt und ich ein Abstürzen über den steilen Abhang fürchte. Doch gelingt es ihm, durch scharfes Einschlagen, das Feste ganz wieder zu erreichen. Doch droht nun der Wagen, dem schon ein nächster folgt, stehen zu bleiben, oder zurück zu rollen. Die Leute tun ihr Äusserstes und setzen noch ein offenbar raketenartiges oder düsenartiges Mittel im Wagen ein. Auf jeden Fall beginnt Wasser heraus zu sprudeln und über die Fensterscheiben und alle Wände zu laufen, als ob der Wagen wie ein Lebewesen schwitze. Dann nimmt er zügig den Berg. Andere Szene: Ein wildes Pferd, das seinen Reiter verloren hat, begegnet mir auf der Strasse und folgt mir. Ich versuche, es abzulenken, klettere schliesslich halb hinauf, so an seiner Seite hängend, um es irgendwo hin zu lenken, doch immer nur versucht es, mich zu beissen. Ich lasse mir nun von den Strassenpassanten, die jetzt kommen und schliesslich meine Zurufe verstehen, nacheinander zwei Knüppel geben. Einen stecke ich dem Pferd in das Maul, damit es mich nicht mehr beissen kann, mit dem anderen schlage ich es wie mit einer Peitsche, um es endlich loszubekommen, damit es mich nicht mehr verfolgt. Mit dem Gedanken, wo ich es treffen muss, damit es läuft, erwache ich und denke: Auf die Kuppe. (383 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1001 (1952-08-31 - Freiburg)Ein Traum über den Theologen Iwand. Ich begegne ihm Abends im Talar in einem Kino. Man kann dort über Nacht auf Bänken ausgestreckt bleiben, um am nächsten Morgen gleich noch einen Film zu sehen. Ich wähle diese Möglichkeit. Nach dem Film bin ich erstaunt, an der Spitze des Zuges der Menschen, die das Kino verlassen, den Theologen in seinem Talar zu sehen, wobei das Schreiten dieses Zuges an das Verlassen einer Kirche durch den Mittelgang gemahnt, auf dem die Gemeinde nach dem Gottesdienst zum Portal schreitet. Ich schliesse aus dem Daseins Iwands, dass auch er die Nacht im Vorraum der Kirche mit uns zugebracht haben muss. (106 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1002 (1952-09-01, 02:45 - Freiburg)Ich bin krank. Professor Gerstel (der weisshaarige Bildhauer) besucht mich und erzählt mir die Geschichte eines Mannes, der in einer Grube verschüttet wird, und seine letzten Traumphantasien. Diese handeln von jemand, der kommen soll und der einen merkwürdigen Namen hat, den ich vergessen habe. Es ist offenbar ein Geist, der mit dem erwarteten Tod zusammenhängt -- andererseits spürt man aber auch, dass er einen menschlichen Befreier erwartet. Gerstel, während er erzählt, beginnt zu frieren. Ich hänge ihm, mich im Bett aufrichtend, eine Decke um. Schliesslich gehe ich mit ihm hinaus auf den Flur des Krankenhauses, in dem ich liege. Hier treffe ich Peter. Es geht jetzt um die Geburt eines Kindes. Doch wird auch ein von mir gezeugtes Kind geboren, während Peter mir erzählt, dass das eine schon geboren sei und ein Sohn sei -- auch das meine wurde ein Junge. Der Arzt hat das anscheinend während meiner Krankheit bei der Mutter festgestellt. Erwachen bald danach um zehn vor drei Uhr Nachts, mit dem Gefühl, es habe dreimal geklingelt. Ich gehe hinaus, um zu öffnen, es ist aber niemand da. (180 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1003 (1952-09-02 - Freiburg)Besuch bei Ernst Jünger. Ankunft in einem Garten. Ernst Jünger sei nicht zu sprechen, sagte Armin Mohler, doch wurden wir in das Haus, eine kleine leichte Konstruktion, zum Essen gebeten. Dann kam auch Ernst Jünger herein, um uns zu begrüssen. Die Szene wandelte sich dann so, dass ich dauerhaft in dem Häuschen wohnte. Ich schlief oben hinter dem Treppengeländer auf einem provisorisch eingerichteten Lager. Nur ab und zu kletterten dort andere Gäste über mich hinweg. Das Haus war sehr leicht gebaut, wie aus japanischen Platten. So musste man, wenn man zum Essen wollte, eine Treppenleiter hochsteigen, und dann einige Platten, die sozusagen eine Falltüre ersetzten, zur Seite schieben, um in den Raum zu gelangen. Bei Tisch sassen wir eng. Auch mein Bruder und meine Kusine Gisela waren da. Es war ein wenig von der Wittmoldter Atmosphäre mit an der Tafel. Später sah ich ein Bild eines modernen Malers unter dem, wie in einer Zeitung, die Unterschrift stand: Nach dem Essen ruht Jünger ein wenig in einem Lehnstuhl mit ausgestreckten Beinen in seinem Garten. Das Bild, das an Picasso erinnerte, zeigtte nur ein buntes Tuch oder Papier, dass der Ruhende zum Schutz gegen die Sonne auf den Kopf gelegt hatte. Dann die Lehnen des Stuhls und die darauf ruhenden Arme ganz leicht farbig angedeutet, ebenso die zur Ruhe ausgestreckten Beine. Doch war das Bild in der Art der dargestellten Haltung völlig überzeugend, so dass man Jünger sofort erkannte. Seinen farbigen Mittelpunkt hatte es jedoch in dem Tuch, auf das man von oben herab blickte. (Hier anschliessend im handschriftlichen Manuskript eine Zeichnung, die einen von oben gesehen sitzenden Mann darstellt, der auf dem Kopf ein Tuch hat, das gleichsam sonnenförmig mit Strichen gezeichnet ist.)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1004 (1952-09-04 - Freiburg)Traum von einem alten Haus, in dem ich wohnte und dessen Plan ich auch schon während des Traumes einmal aufzeichnete. Er entwickelte und verwandelte sich im Laufe des Traums. In der Küche, die aus drei Räumlichkeiten bestand, wirkten im Laufe des Traumes viele, so Emmi, Fräulein Schlotterbeck (Roggow), die Köchin aus dem Lilienhof und andere. Jörg Brena kochte für sich selbst in einer eigenen Küche. Ein bestimmtes Zimmer in dem Haus hiess "der Freund des Todes". Dort wohnte niemand. Zu diesem Zimmer "der Freund des Todes" führte eine kleine Treppe mit wenigen Stufen hinan, die "die Scala" hiess. In einer Zeichnung, die ich während des Traumes gemacht hatte, und die zu einfach war, korrigierte Emmi einiges und malte unter anderem diese Treppe hinein, wobei sie zunächst meinen Federhalter falsch anfasste, so dass er nur dünne Striche gab. Sie legte so grossen Wert auf das Wort "Scala", das sie immer wieder daran rum malte, bis schliesslich alle Buchstaben in dicker blauer Tintenfarbe ineinander liefen und man nur noch von einer Seite in bestimmter Beleuchtung das Wort lesen konnte. Frau v. Wolzogen in ihrer charaktristischen Bescheidenheit war in dem Gastzimmer immer wie halb abwesend. Man wusste kaum von dem Zimmer. Mutti fuhr zuletzt im Auto mit ihr ab. Ich sollte auch mitfahren, obwohl ich gar nicht in der Stadt zu tun hatte. Holte mir noch schnell aus meinem Zimmer ein Buch zum Lesen und Zigaretten, blieb aber dann da, weil noch zwei alte Damen mitfuhren und nun das Auto zu voll schien. Vorher andere Traumszene um das Thema Haus. So drangen wir in ein leerstehendes Haus ein, um uns darin heimisch zu machen. Als wir gerade von den Zimmern Besitz ergriffen, sie verteilt hatten, kamen die eigentlichen Besitzer zurück. Meine erste Reaktion war eine Art Totstellreflex. Die Räumlichkeit des Hauses war in dieser Szene schon fast die selbe wie in der folgenden, die sich aus ihr entwickelte. Das Haus kommt mir überhaupt nicht unbekannt vor. Es hat Entsprechungen aus anderen Träumen. Als Kind zeichnete ich übrigens mal eine Karte des weitläufigen Schlosses in Roggow (wie eine Puppenstube aus der Vogelschau mit allen Möbel), und wo ich das Ganze aus mehreren Flügel gewachsene Haus erkundete.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1005 (1952-09-05 - Freiburg)Gang durch die Stadt mit der Gioconda, die vor ihrer Abreise aus Frankfurt war. Mein Bruder spielte eine Rolle, der uns in sein Zimmer einlud. So konnten wir auch einen Tag bleiben. Später wandelte sich unmerklich Ikas Gestalt in dem Traum in die Giselas. Andere Szene: Zimmersuche in einem Hotel. Ich bin sehr existentialistisch angezogen. Ein gelbes Hemd (in der Farbe von Trudels Bluse) hängt über die Hose. Meinen Nicki habe ich zusammengeknäult unter dem Arm. (Pullover). Ich suche ein Zimmer in einem abseits des Strassenlärms gelegenen Flügel. Gross und geräumig und mit dem Blick auf Gärten. Es stehen zwei oder drei Betten darin, auch geht man durch ein leeres Vorzimmer hinein, aber das ist mir egal, denn ich suche vor allem Raum und Ruhe. Später, wohl am nächsten Morgen, sagt mir eine Frau: "Das Zimmer, in dem Ihr wohnt, ist das Idiotenzimmer. Deshalb hat es auch Gitter vor den Fenstern." Ich schaue in die anderen Zimmer, deren Türen offen stehen, und sehe lauter kleine mit Nebensächlichkeiten vollgepfropfte Räume und denke: "Wieviel besser ist es in jenem freien und geräumigen 'Idiotenzimmer'".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1006 (1952-09-06 - Freiburg)In Basel vor dem Schaufenster Christian Diors, dessen hohe Eleganz bisher bei jedem Besuch mich fasziniert hatte. Heute stimmte etwas mit dem Schaufenster nicht. Zwar schien es zuerst in seinem alten Zauber, in dem ganz weniges Schwarz, ein Tuch, ein grosser Handschuh und eine Stoffbüste mit einem Federbusch zwischen Bambusstäben, die kompliziert miteinander verbunden waren, vor lauter Spiegelwänden den Eindruck höchster Eleganz machte. Das fiel mir auf, als ich in einem Nachbarladen einen schwarzen Damenhut gekauft hatte, der mir zunächst schien wie tausend andere auch. Als ich ihn aber vor das Dior-Schaufenster hielt, schien er von einem merkwürdigen Glanz verklärt und erschien in hoher Eleganz in den tausend Spiegelungen. Dann aber schien das Schaufenster plötzlich ganz banal und mit durchschnittlichen Möbeln vollgestopft. Trudel machte mich darauf aufmerksam, dass ein Schaufenster der Nachbarseite dieser Strasse sich in den Scheiben spiegelte. Ich ging nun ganz dicht an die Scheiben, um die Spiegelung zu durchschauen. Trudel war schon weitergegangen. Dann entdeckte ich hinter der Scheibe wohl noch französische Namen. Es waren Möbel, Bücher und anderes, wie in einem Antiquariat von verschiedenen französischen Firmen ausgestellt. Das Fenster war zwar geschmackvoll, hatte aber nichts mehr von der alten Eleganz. Dann traf ich plötzlich Christian Ferber. Ich war ungeheuer beglückt, ihn in dieser Stadt zu sehen und fragte i ihn: "Willst Du hier in Basel studieren?" Er sagte: "Nein, was hat Basel schon zu bieten. Du weißt, dass Karl Jaspers zusammengepfiffen ist." -- Ich versuchte nun, ihn für Freiburg zu werben, und dass er doch bei Heidegger studieren solle. Ich sagte, dass ich mit Trudel hier sei, sie sei aber vorgegangen. "Wo ist denn das Mädchen?" Er: "Da ist sie ja". Auf einer Brücke sass sie auf der Brüstung zwischen vielen anderen Menschen. Ich konnte sie zunächst nicht erkennen und wunderte mich, dass Ferber, der sie nicht kannte, sie erkannte. Sie liess sich rückwärts fallen, so dass sie ausgestreckt auf der Brüstung lag, und sprach mit einem kleinen Mädchen. Das Mädchen war nackt und vom Körperbau wie ein Baby, hatte aber schon kleine Brüste. (338 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1007 (1952-09-07 - Freiburg)Dieter zeigt mir die Betten, wohl in der Napola, die, um Raum zu sparen, als Klappbetten an der Wand befestigt sind. Durch einen Griff lässt man sie herunter. Mir leuchtet dieser Mechanismus ein, doch finde ich es bedauerlich, dass man so nie am Tags sich einige Minuten ausstrecken kann, obwohl diese kurze Besinnungszeit doch so fruchtbar ist. Wir lassen die Betten herunter und sitzen darauf. Die Szene wechselt. Es ist jetzt Hf., mit dem ich zusammen bin. Ich finde auf einem Bett Papier von ihm, eine Zeichnung von meinem Kopf, in der ich gut getroffen bin. Als ich das Blatt gegen das Licht halte, entdeckte ich, wohl von der Rückseite durchschimmernd, hinter meinem Kopf das Bild des Kopfes seiner neuen Freundin, an der die Augen so charakteristisch sind. Das Gesicht fällt durch die geschwungene zügige Linie des Profils auf, in die das Dunkle, aber in seinem Glanz stark zusammengefasste Auge gut einbezogen ist. Es ist ein Auge, das durch seinen schwarzen, aber nicht flackernden Glanz wie ein geschliffener Edelstein wirkt, jedoch ohne zu funkeln oder zu changieren. Dann entdecke ich noch andere Zeichnungen, die aus einer zweiten dahinter gefalteten Seite des Papiers ebenfalls durch das selbe Bild durchschimmern, zum Beispiel eine Federzeichnung des Martinstors. Andere Szene: Ich bin jetzt ausserhalb des Hauses, das dem, in dem ich wohne gleicht. Die Nachbarn haben den Zaun, den die Baumgärtnerin nach dem Bombenangriff auf deren Grundstück verschieben liess (bzw. als es die Handwerker getan hatten, nichts dagegen einwendete), jetzt wieder zurückgesetzt, weil das Grundstück neu bebaut wird. Er steht so dicht am Haus, dass man kaum in die Tür kommt. Auch ist die Tür verschlossen. Ich merke, dass ich die falsche gewählt habe, denn eine zweite Tür, die sonst noch da war, ist jetzt am Anfang des Hauses. Ich entdecke jetzt auch die richtige, die dagegen wie ein grosses Portal ist, verweile aber noch bei der kleinen. Es scheint mir wie eine Hausmeisterswohnung, dann aber merke ich, dass es der Eingang zur Bildhauerklasse der Kunstakademie ist (in diese kann man durch eine Tür, die wegen der Modelle stets verschlossen ist, auch direkt von aussen herein). Andere Szene: In der Bildhauerklasse. Trudel ist dort. Sie hat sich einen grünen Stoff gekauft, samtig glänzend, der in einem bestimmten Faltenwurf aussah wie eine Schildkröte. Diese Kröte lässt sie nun von einem der Bildhauer, Breuing, als Plastik machen. Ein anderer, Graffe, spielt im Raum herum. Er hat eine elektrische Schnur, die er so an mich halten will, dass ich einen Schlag kriege. Ich protestiere zunächst und wehre mich, auch ist es mir nicht ganz klar, wie das gelingen soll, da doch im Stecker am Ende der Schnur die Kontaktbuchsen versenkt sind. Er dreht die Schnur aber einfach um, so dass sie an diesem Ende angeschlossen ist und die beiden herausstehenden Enden, die man eigentlich in den Steckkontakt tut, frei sind. Da auch Trudel ihm hilft, lasse ich mir das Spiel gefallen. Jedoch kribbelt es nur so wenig, dass ich nicht weiss, ob der Strom nur so schwach ist, oder ob überhaupt noch keiner in der Leitung ist und ich es mir nur vorstelle. (516 words)

Begegnung mit Marion. -- Mit Ika in einer grossen Stadt. Wir zeichnen Strassen und Plätze. Später sitze ich am Ufer eines Sees, ähnlich dem Schweriner See. Drüben am jenseitigen Ufer ist eine Sprengung. Ich spüre zuerst den Druck in den Ohren, höre dann den Knall. Dann nach einer Weile kommt eine riesenhafte Flutwelle angelaufen, die ein beträchtliches Stück an der Uferböschung hochklettert. Es ist ein beglückender Anblick. Ich bringe die Sprengung drüben mit irgendwelchen Dingen in Zusammenhang. Andere, ältere Szene: Im Schloss eines Despoten von Napoleon-hafter Gestalt, der erstochen wird. Der Haushofmeister, ein breitschultriger schwedischer Riese, will sich mit seinem Degen das Leben nehmen. Er sieht jedoch, wie seine Frau sich erhängt hat. Das stösst ihn ab, und er beschliesst, weiter zu leben. Ich gehe mit ihm hinaus in die Stadt und durch die Strassen. Eine andere Szene: Mit der Emme an der Südwestenglischen Küste. Wir klettern zwischen den Felsen. Dann geht es durch eine Art Felsentor, ich ahne, dass hier Lands-End ist. Wir gehen eine Treppe hoch -- ein ungeheures Panorama erschliesst sich dem Blick: Wir übersehen die ganzen Küsten Europas. Die Alpen und die Pyrenäen als weisse Ketten. Plötzlich bewegt sich die Plattform, auf der wir stehen, ins Meer hinaus. Wir sind, als wir die Treppen hochgingen, unversehens auf die Brücke eines Schiffs gelangt. Es macht eine Rundfahrt, läuft in einen Hafen. Die Passagierkarten sollen am Ausgang kontrolliert werden. Ich finde einen seitlichen Ausschlupf, gelange von da in einen Torweg, von da in die Stadt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1012 (1952-09-15 - Freiburg)Traum von einem betrunkenen Jungen, der mich beissen will. Er hat einen stark verbundenen Kopf, ist aber völlig von Sinnen und beginnt, mit mir zu ringen und mich im Gesicht zu beissen. Ich versuche, ihn möglichst vorsichtig von mir zu halten, um ihn zu schonen. Schliesslich kommen seine Tanten. Es ist eine Schulatmosphäre. Auch vorher spielen Schulprobleme eine Rolle. Ich gehe noch zur Schule, obwohl ich schon studiere -- sozusagen freiwillig, um besser griechisch zu lernen. Doch auch Bender spielt in dieser Schule eine Rolle. Nun muss ich mich entschliessen, jetzt während der Doktorprüfung damit aufzuhören, habe mich aber schon so an die Autorität des Stundenplans gewöhnt, dass mir das ein Problem scheint. Vorher andere Szene: Auf dem flachen Dach einer Kirche, zugleich wie das Dach eines Häuserblocks und wie das Dach einer alten Kirche mit ihren Balken und Verstrebungen anmutend -- es ist sozusagen ein Dach, das mit einer Fülle von Balken und Verstrebungen zugleich wie ein Industriebau und ein einsamer Kirchendachboden wirkt -- am Rande offen, ohne Gitter. Kinder laufen herum. Ich habe grosse Angst, dass sie herunterfallen könnten. Einem etwas älteren Jungen äussere ich diese Befürchtung. Er meint: die Kinder seien völlig gewohnt, hier herumzulaufen. Sie seien furchtbar dreckig und die Leute unangenehm. Er sei erst seit wenigen Tagen hier zum Saubermachen angestellt. Dann kommt die Frau und beschwert sich, dass im Klo etwas kaputt sei. (Das Holz verquollen, glaube ich). Es ist jetzt, als wenn ich bei ihr zu Miete wohne. Sie bittet: "Können Sie mir nicht bitte auch einen Pfennig geben, um die Reparatur zu bezahlen?" Dieses Lamento ist natürlich rhetorisch gemeint. Ich soll mich an den Kosten beteiligen. Ich sage: "Gerne", ziehe mein Portemonnaie und gebe ihr einen Pfennig. Sie ist sehr enttäuscht. Ich mache ihr klar, dass solche Abnützungskosten sich von der Miete decken müssen. Andere Szene: Auf dem selben Dach eine Katze, eine grosse, die mich sozusagen umarmt, dass heisst ganz aufrecht stehend mit mir spielt. Sie gefällt mir gut. Irgend jemand sagt, ich solle es nicht tun. Von hier wohl der Szenenwechsel zu den beissenden Jungen. (345 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1014 (1952-09-17 - Freiburg)Letzte Szene eines Traums: Von einem Hause. Vorbereitung der Abfahrt oder Abreise mit zwei männlichen Begleitern, Gestalten wie Vater und Bruder. Ich bin etwas umständlich mit meinen Wünschen beim Verpacken. Es wird ihnen zu bunt. Sie schliessen die Tür der grossen Lastmaschine und fahren einfach ab. Ich gehe nun, um meinen Koffer aus der Wohnung zu holen und mir selbst zu helfen, wobei das Beleidigungsgefühl durch Gleichgültigkeit niederzuschlagen suche. Dann (Szenenwechsel) sitze ich alleine in einem Volkswagen. Es ist das erste Mal, dass ich ein Auto steuere, doch glückt die Fahrt mit einer schlafwandlerischen Sicherheit. An einer Ecke, ähnlich dem Schwabentor, biege ich zunächst in die falsche Strasse, eine Einbahnstrasse ein, entdecke aber noch so rechtzeitig das Sperrschild, dass ich zurücksetzen kann, was ohne viel Bedenken geschieht, und halb links in die richtige Strasse einbiege. Ich will dann in eine Strasse in einem nördlichen Stadtviertel (etwa wie Herdern). Sie heisst Königstrasse -- verläuft etwa wie die Hauptstrasse. Dazu muss ich vorher eine Eisenbahnlinie überqueren, über die der Weg im Winkel hinwegführt, um den Höhenunterschied des Bahndamms zu überwinden. Mein Fahrzeug ist jetzt ein Schlitten, der sich aus eigener Kraft bewegt und auf dem ich auf dem Bauch liege. Dahinter ein langer Anhängerschlitten. Ich fahre über die Geleise, obwohl ich schon ein Klingelgeräusch höre, das einen nahenden Zug ankündigt. Die Schranken werden inzwischen runtergelassen. Mein Bruder, der hinter mir auf einem anderen Fahrzeug fährt, warnt mich noch. Doch ich habe Glück. Die zweite Schranke ist so tief, gleichsam flach auf den Boden gesenkt, dass ich darüber hinweggleiten kann. Ich komme nun in die "Königstrasse". Fahre auf dem Bürgersteig mit meinem Schlitten sehr schnell bergab. Die Strasse gleicht der Strasse in Schwerin, in der unser Elternhaus stand. Mein Streben ist offenbar, schnell dort hin zu kommen. Kinder auf dem Bürgersteig, die nicht aufpassen, rufe ich im letzten Moment an, um sie nicht zu überfahren, da ich den Schlitten bergab nicht bremsen kann. Ich umsteure sie alle schwungvoll, muss jedoch oft fürchten, mit meinem langen Anhänger nicht durchzukommen. Zuletzt will mir ein etwas derber älterer Mann im braunen Lodenmantel in den Weg treten, da er es unerhört findet, dass ich auf dem Bürgersteig fahre. Ich beschliesse, noch im Erwachen, ihn zur Seite zu schubsen, da ich ihn sonst überfahren müsste. (377 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1015 (1952-09-18 - Freiburg)Traum von vielen Bildern an der Zimmertür, Zeichnungen von Trudel oder mir, die wunderbar lebten. Köpfe und Gestalten. Ich erzählte meinem Vater von einer Anhalterfahrt nach Basel. Auf der Rückfahrt hatte der Fahrer einen kleinen Umweg über Paris gemacht, um Notre Dame de Paris zu sehen. Mein Vater sagte: "Ja das ist gut möglich. Paris liegt von Basel nur 42 Kilometer entfernt." Diese Szene hing irgendwie mit den Bildern an der Tür zusammen, wuchs aus ihrer bunten Fülle heraus. Jedenfalls sah ich den heiteren Bau von Notre Dame und erwachte sehr beglückt. (92 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1016 (1952-09-21 - Freiburg)Ich wohne in einem Zimmer mit Tessen Werner. Die Treppe hochkommend sehe ich, dass Gesine zurück ist. Allerlei Verwandte von ihr wimmeln beschäftigt herum. Ein kleiner Junge hackt gerade Holz. Er ist dabei, eine Kiste, die vor dem Käfig steht und uns gehört, auseinander zu hacken. Ich stelle ihn zur Rede, lasse ihm aber die Kiste, als ich erfahre, dass er einen Teil von ihr schon zerhackt hat. T.W. -- drinnen im Zimmer, das indessen grösser ist als der Käfig, ähnlich unserem gemeinsamen Göttinger Zimmer -- knallt, als er von der Sache erfährt, wütend die Tür zu und bricht in Tränen aus. Er hat an der Tür allerlei Pflanzen, Schneeglöckchen und ähnliches, mit ihren Wurzeln und Zwiebeln angeheftet, dazu einen in einer ein wenig kindlichen gestochen-gotischen Schrift einer Freundin geschriebenen Brief. Die Kiste stand offenbar damit im Zusammenhang. Mich rührt die ganze Sinnlosigkeit des Unterfangens, da doch die Blumen an der Tür alle vertrocknen müssen. Ich suche ihn zu trösten, schliesse ihn in die Arme. Doch steigt dabei eigene ferne Trauer so gewaltig in mir auf, dass ich zu weinen beginne. Er dadurch noch angesteckt, beginnt sich einfach fallen zu lassen. Ich gebe ihm indessen einen Ruck und ermahne ihn, stehen zu bleiben. Erwachen mit einer grossen Melancholie. (208 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1018 (1952-09-23 - Freiburg)Im Atelier der Baumgärtnerin. Ich zeichne, vor allem immer wieder meine brauen Mokkatasse aus Ton. Die Zeichnungen gefallen mir gut. Dann ist die Baumgärtnerin abgereist. Durch Zufall entdecke ich später, dass sie das Gas nicht abgestellt hat. Es strömt noch aus und die Flammen brennen noch. Andere Szene: In einem Rundfunkhaus in einer Grossstadt -- gegenüber dem Regierungsgebäude liegend -- in einer stillen Seitenstrasse. Ich brauche ein Magnetophon, um meine Träume zu sprechen. Ein Angestellter, der ein wenig aussieht wie Israel, der Assistent des philosophischen Seminars, zeigt mir eine Möglichkeit, indem er eine Geschichte erzählt, von Spuren einer Karawane in der Wüste, denen man folgen soll, das heisst, ich soll ein Magnetophon nehmen, das schon jemand anders gebraucht hat, damit es nicht so auffällt. Zuerst verstehe ich seine Anspielungen nicht -- erst als er sie erklärt. Andere Traumszene vor dem Erwachen und ins Erwachen übergehend: Das Haus brennt. Ich will das Wichtigste aus dem Käfig retten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1019 (1952-09-24 - Freiburg)Ich traf Nicolai Hartmann auf der Strasse und ging mit ihm in ein schlossartiges Haus, wo ich bei Heidegger wohnte. Wir gingen zunächst in ein unteres Zimmer, das der gemeinsamen Arbeit diente. Ich führte ihn dann aber über die Treppe hinauf zu Heidegger, nachdem ich ihm vorgeschlagen hatte, diesen doch einmal wiederzusehen, worauf er, ein wenig zu meinem Erstaunen, einwilligte. Beide begrüssten sich kollegial. Heidegger fragte Hartmann, ob er nicht eine Tasse Tee mit ihm trinken wolle, und schloss mit dem Satz: "Wir wollen mal sehen, was die unten für uns gemacht haben". Ich ging aus der Stube, um die beiden, die sich Jahrzehnte lang nicht gesehen hatten, allein zu lassen, hoffte aber, sie würden mich zum Tee wieder holen, da ich an ihrem Gespräch natürlich gerne teilhaben wollte. Ich stieg die Treppe in dem konzentrisch um in jedem Stockwerk je eine Halle angelegten Haus hinab und ging in das untere Zimmer. Es war Weihnachten, die Gabentische standen noch. Ich hatte wohl die Türe aufgelassen. Auf jedem Fall sah ich draussen in der Halle meinen Vater, der in diesem Hause Onkel Deti, meinen Patenonkel Bülow, der ein grosser Jäger ist, und Vaters alter Regimentskamarad, besuchen wollte. Ich entdeckte an Vaters Schlips mit der FF-Nadel (der Grossherzoge von Mecklenburg) irgend einen Schmuck, der mir gefiel, was ich lobte. Als ich näher zusah, entdeckte ich jedoch über dem Knoten des Schlipses mit der FF-Nadel noch ein kronenartiges Gebilde aus grossen Perlen. Es war die Bekrönung einer Art Handtasche, die er unter dem Schlips angebracht hatte. Auf dem tiefschwarzen Stoff der Tasche hob sich der mattschwarze Schlips nur hauchartig wie auf alten Gemälden ab. Auch hatte Vater um die ganz schmal und langfingrig gewordenen Hände lange Brilliantenketten gelegt, die elegant zwischen den Fingern hindurchgehen. Ich erkannte an diesem Schmuckbedürfnis die beginnende Arteriosklerose. Doch imponierte mir sehr die märchenhafte Gestalt, die an einen spanischen Granden aus der Zeit des Velasquez gemahnte. Ich erzählte ihm, dass Hartmann oben bei Heidegger sei. Er ging dann fort, und ich kehrte in das Zimmer zu den Weihnachtstischen zurück. Ich nahm mir Schokolade von meinem Tisch, den ich mit einem jungen Bülow (Hans Bülow) teilte, und wartete. Nebenan wurde, wie ich vorhin gesehen hatte, der Baum gerichtet. Auch hörte ich jetzt wunderbares Geigenspiel und erkannte, dass dort Gisela für ein Vorspiel probte. Ich ging auf den Flur, doch merkte ich, dass ich es in dem Zimmer besser hörte, und gab mich ganz dem Genuss der silbern reinen Töne hin. Doch stieg zugleich eine tiefe Traurigkeit in mir empor. Ich trat wieder an meinen Tisch und nahm eine Hegel-Ausgabe, um darin zu lesen. Da trat Heidegger herein, begleitet von Hans Bülow, der zufällig dazu gekommen war, obwohl er ja mit Philosophie gar nichts zu tun hatte, und mit beiden oben Tee getrunken hatte. Als Heidegger mich noch traurig ob des Zuhörens sah, sagte er ein wenig betroffen: "Bist Du gekränkt. Komm, wir gehen gleich zusammen herauf." Ich versicherte, ich sei nicht gekränkt. Wir verliessen das Zimmer und stiegen zusammen die schwere alte Holztreppe hinauf. Das Haus mit seinen alten Hallen und Treppen war ein wenig wie das Schloss, das Ernst Jünger in Wilflingen bewohnt. Heidegger zeigte mir eine wunderbare alte Holzplastik eines insulanischen Stammes, die er erworben hatte. Sie war aus dem Holz geschnitzt, ein Kopf, so wie zuweilen Rodinsche Plastiken aus dem Stein gehauen sind, als seien sie daraus hervorgewachsen. Kopf und Holz bildeten zusammen einen dreiecksförmigen Block. Die Arbeit stand auf der Treppe, wo wir sie im Vorbeigehen berührten. Erwachen. Das Haus hatte schon in einer vorgehenden Szene in etwas variierter Form eine Rolle gespielt, und zwar war es ein Barockhaus, zunächst konzentrisch um eine kreisförmige Halle angelegt, die sich in jedem Stockwerk wiederholte. Im obersten Stockwerk war die Halle dann quadratisch und sehr wohnlich mit viel Stoff eingerichtet. Von da aus hat sich dann wohl das Bild des ganzen Hauses von einem kreisförmigen in einen quadratischen Kern gewandelt. (651 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1020 (1952-09-25 - Freiburg)Ich schlafe in einem etwa mannshohen äusserst schwankenden Bett, in dem ich mich nicht sicher fühle. Ich versuche, durch Gewichtsverlagerung das Bett an die Wand zu lehnen, merke jedoch, dass der Spalt zu breit ist, und muss fürchten, mit dem ganzen Gestell zu stürzen. Meine Aussicht geht auf das Schwabentor, an dem man eine kitschige Veranda aus Holz entfernt hat. Die Balkenlöcher wurden mit Steinen zugefügt. Dennoch stört mich die Veränderung, weil ich mich an den Anblick gewöhnt hatte. (79 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1021 (1952-09-25 - Freiburg)Situation am Anfang des Semesters. Ich komme in ein Quäkerhaus, wo Zimmer, Speisungen usw. vermittelt werden. Zwei Frauen, die diese Arbeit sehr geschickt ausführen. Die eine gleicht einer Frau in einem sehr schönen Antiquariat (der Kunstspiegel), in dem ich gestern mit Trudel war. Später gehe ich mit den Frauen in eine Mensa und beginne zu essen. Die eine Frau gibt mir ein kleines Päckchen mit: Brötchen und Kuchenteilchen und sagt: "Das ist Ihre Halbtagesration", legt es mir offen hin, nimmt ein Brötchen davon und sagt: "Ich nehme mir selbst schnell ein bisschen davon". Ich bin über diese Spende entzückt, besonders über die taktvolle Art der Mitteilung. (106 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1022 (1952-09-26 - Freiburg)Traum von einer Hafenstadt, Marseille oder Venedig. Blick vom Quai auf das Wasser. Andere Szene: Strassenverkehr mit schräg heranführenden Zuleitungen, wie an der Autobahn. Grosse amerikanische Wagen rollen heran. Die ganze Anlage war draussen vor dem Käfig - wohl da, wo Schwarzwaldstrasse und Talstrasse sich treffen. Hie ist es in der Tat ein Verkehrsknotenpunkt. Man spürt auch Nachts den starken Verkehr, der hier aus der Schweiz, Deutschland und Frankreich in den Schwarzwald führt. (73 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1023 (1952-09-29 - Freiburg)Eine ältere Frau will zum Fenster hereinsteigen, während Emme und ich im Zimmer sind. Ich verweigere ihr den Eintritt. Sie fällt, obwohl das Fenster niedrig über dem Boden ist, in den Garten, oder Strassenrand zurück. Andere Szene: Es klingelt dreimal, während Emme bei mir ist. Ich sage: "Das wird diese Frau sein." Drücke von oben den Türöffner und sehe sie zunächst und beschliesse, sie heraufzulassen, weil sie sehr erschöpft ist. Später, als die Gestalt heraufkommt, erkenne ich indessen einen Mann. Ich frage: "Wollen Sie zu mir?" Er sagt: "Nein, nein, nur hierher", und wendet sich zu Roguszkas Schrank, in den er windesschnell einen Schlüssel steckt und ihn auszuräumen beginnt. Ich sage: "Halt, halt". Da ich ihn als Dieb erkenne, packe ich ihn am Schlawittchen (es ist ein ganz kleiner Mann) und rufe laut. Gesine, die gerade von ihrer Reise zurück ist, hat das Geschrei gehört und kommt heraus. Sie ist aber ganz von einer Freude erfüllt, merkt gar nicht, was los ist, und ruft noch im Unterrock strahlend mir zu: "Du, ich werde Sie genannt." Dies ist insofern komisch, als sie mich sonst nie Du nennt, selbst aber stets Sie genannt wird. Es deutet aber wohl auf ein Wachsen ihrer Autorität in der Hochschule. Ich freue mich über ihr Du, deute aber auf den Einbrecher, den ich schnell die Treppe runterschleppe, wobei sie im Unterrock als Bewachung mitkommen muss. Ich rufe laut Römers, um bei diesen die Polizei anzutelefonieren. Ein anderer schlanker Mann, der die Treppe heraufkommt, stellt sich als Komplize des Einbrechers heraus, wird aber abgewehrt, kann jedoch entkommen, da ich nicht geistesgegenwärtig bin, ihn auch zu packen. Erwachen. (270 words)

Ich halte sie für Giftgas, da ich gleichzeitig ein Flugzeug im Tiefflug höre, und renne draussen auf den Gang, wo ich zunächst in Deckung gehe. Da ich keinen Geruch wahrnehme, gedenke ich, in meinem Kopfhörer zu hören, ob der Rundfunk eine Nachricht durchgibt, da ich annehme, dass man dort Gasmasken hat. Mich beunruhigt der Gedanke, vielleicht schon vergiftet zu sein. (71 words)

Jedoch ist das Buch messerscharf und geometrisch genau geschieden, so dass man annehmen muss, dass es schon in der Technik des Buchbinders vorgesehen war. Andere Szene: Gisela und Peter kommen, ihre Räder schiebend, vor meinem Haus vorbei. Ich spreche sie an. Sie steigen gerade auf. Es ist, als wenn sie mich nicht sehen. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1026 (1952-10-02 - Freiburg)Mit einem Luxemburger oder Franzosen in Deutschland. Wir strolchen herum. Ich zeige ihm manches, das er positiv oder abwertig beurteilt. Zuletzt klettert er auf eine Leiter, die irgendwo angestellt ist, und fordert mich auf, nachzukommen. Als ich erst wenige Sprossen erstiegen habe, beginnt die Leiter sich zu neigen und langsam umzusinken. Ich fordere ihn, der oben steht, auf, abzuspringen. Er lässt sich sehr geschickt mit der Leiter herabgleiten, und springt erst im letzten Moment ab. Wir fahren hinten auf einem offenen Lastauto, an das Führerhäuschen gelehnt. Gegenüber auf der Rückplanke des Fahrzeuges sitzt mein gefallener Freud Jürgen Wächter mit seinen blonden Haaren. Ich schaue ihm tief in seine blauen, ein wenig strengen Augen. Anderer Traum: Gisela zu Besuch. Sie zieht sich aus, bis auf ein Dreieckshöschen und einen Büstenhalter. Ich sehe, dass ihr Kind wirklich nicht so sehr gross ist, wie ich gedacht hatte. (144 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1027 (1952-10-03 - Freiburg)Besuch bei Heidegger. Wir besprechen eine griechische Aristoteles-Stelle. Ich hole etwas zu Essen und, ich glaube, Kaffee für uns bei seiner Frau. Andere Szene: Im philosophischen Seminar, zuvor ist es mein Käfig, wo ich diesen Traum auf einen winzigen Zettel, ich habe keinen anderen, aufzuschreiben versuche. Dauernd werde ich gestört. Immer wenn ich mir die Szene gerade vorstellen will, spricht jemand. Zuerst ist es der Psychologie Kalthof mit einem Freund, der im Käfig zu Besuch gekommen ist. Dann, als die Szene schon im Seminar spielt, die Seminarbenutzer, die, alle offenbar in Ferienstimmung, nicht richtig arbeiten. Ich schlage mehrmals mit der Faust auf den Tisch, um mir Ruhe zu erzwingen. Vergeblich. Schliesslich gibt es einen lebhaften Disput darüber. Ein älterer Mann, der aussieht wie der Vorsitzende des Kunstvereins, lenkt allmählich ein, obwohl auch er gegen mich debattiert, und schlägt vor, ein Schild, "Bitte Ruhe" an die Wand zu hängen. Es soll mit roter Schreibmaschine geschrieben werden. Ich sage, das sei zu klein. Es gibt keine grössere Maschine. Schliesslich bietet sich Dorwarth, der Maler und Schwager von Gregor, der zugegen ist, an, das Schild mit einer Art Riesen-Schreib-, oder besser Mal-Maschine zu malen. (191 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1028 (1952-10-03 - Freiburg)Strassenbahnfahrt aus einem entlegenen Stadtviertel nach Hause. Es führen mehrere Linien dort hin. Ich wähle einen alten Wagen, auf dem steht: "Landwehr über Schwarzwaldstrasse" (in welche ich gelangen muss). Der Wagen fährt Umwege durch ein Industriegelände. Ich sehe ein Viadukt aus Rohren: "Das sind ja die Böhringer-Werke." Ein Mädchen neben mir: "Die Böhringer-Werke sind doch nicht hier in Freiburg, die sind doch in Mainz." Ich: "Nicht in Mainz, in Ingelheim." Die Mädchen, mit denen ich noch manche Blicke wechselte, steigen aus. Ich stehe allein vorne auf der Plattform. Die Strassenbahn scheint sozusagen rückwärts zu fahren, denn es ist kein Führer vorn. Auch sieht man keine Schienen. Doch fährt sie völlig gleichmässig. Ich trete direkt an das Fenster vor uns, um besser zu sehen. Die Bahn setzt in elegantem Schwung einen Berg hinan, auf dessen Bekrönung sich überwältigend in seiner Romanik der Mainzer Dom erhebt. Ich bin ergriffen von diesem gewaltigen Anblick der Ruhe und des Schönen. Die Bahn ist im Nu daran vorbei durch ein Stadttor hinaus. Freiburg liegt offenbar so dicht bei Mainz wie Wiesbaden.

Andere Szene: Engländer beschauen über die Trümmer hinweg das Münster. Dort ist eine Statue angebracht, die sie beschäftigt: "Die Tänzerin auf der Weltkugel." Eine Engländerin verspricht mir Bilder, und zwar zuerst sind es Aktphotographien (Die Leute, die sie mir geben wollen, sitzen in einem kleinen Auto und halten die Sache für sehr wichtig), nachher sind es Zeichnungen, Originale von vielen Malern, die ich schon unterwegs betrachte. Dann in einer Art Wärmestube. Zwei strickende Mädchen setzen sich zu mir. Die Leute sind alle sehr lebhaft, zum Teil schizophren, und haben grosse Theorien. Man kann kaum alles auf einmal hören und antworten. Andere Szene: Eine nackte Frau, die zu mir kommt. (149 words)

Symphonie von Beethoven ein, und dann tauchte die Gestalt Eugen Jochums auf, von dem ich Weihnachten vor zwei Jahren die Symphonie in vielen Proben dirigiert hörte. Sodann fiel mir ein Traum aus jener Zeit ein, in dem die Gestalten Heideggers, Jochums und Jüngers verdichtet waren. (84 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1035 (1952-10-11 - Freiburg)Heute Nacht: Traum im Erwachen. Ich ging über einen grossen Platz mit geschlossenen Augen. Plötzlich hatte ich den Eindruck, dass sich ein Abgrund unter mir öffnet und riss die Augen auf. Ich sah unter mir in der Tiefe eines Abgrundes ein waagerechtes Gestänge, auf das ich fast herabgestürzt wäre. Erst im vollen Erwachen begriff ich, dass ich auf meinem Rücken in meinem Bett lag und das Gestänge waagerecht über mir war, nämlich das Gestänge des Käfigs zwischen dessen schräg geneigten Wänden. Die Lage war also im Traum um 180 Grad gedreht. Hier folgt im handschriftlichen Manuskript erst eine Zeichnung, wo man das zeltartige Zimmer namens Käfig sieht und einen Mann auf dem Bett liegend, dessen Blick nach oben in das die schrägen Wände verbindende Gestänge zeigt und darunter die Unterschrift: Blick des Schläfers im Erwachen. Dann kommt eine andere Zeichnung, da sieht man den Mann über einem Abgrund stehen und das Bild ist sozusagen spiegelverkehrt, geht nach unten und das Gestänge ist unter ihm in einer tiefen Grube und darunter steht: Blick des Träumers in den Abgrund. Und zwischen beiden ist ein Halbkreis gezeichnet, um den ein Pfeil läuft mit der Bezeichnung 180 Grad: Solche Lageverlagerung faszinierte mich schon oftmals an Aufwachträumen. (202 words)

Ich schiebe nach, doch klemmt es am Dach, aber nicht so fest, dass es nicht doch wieder zurückrollt. Das Dach des Wagens wird dabei immer mehr eingebeult. Ich habe ein schlechtes Gewissen. Andere Szene: Unsere Emmi weckt mich. Ich versuche, mich meiner Träume zu entsinnen. Sie will mir dabei helfen und redet laut dazwischen und zeichnet einen Leuchtturm. Ich bitte sie, zu schweigen, doch sie redet aus Bosheit erstrecht. Ich beginne zu puffen und zu stossen, und schliesslich, als das nicht hilft, zu kratzen. Der Raum, in dem ich schlafe, ist jetzt sehr gross, das heisst, ein zweiter ist dem meinen angeschlossen. In jenem zweiten Raum steht unser Reis und kocht, während ich und Emme im Bett liegen. Wir hoffen, dass er inzwischen nicht anbrennt, weil Reis sehr beständig ist. (142 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1038 (1952-10-12 - Freiburg)Simon Simone de Buconi hiess ein Hellseher, dessen Einzug in Benders Institut ich heute Nacht im Traum erlebte. Ich stand mit der Emme in einer Tür des Hauses, die sich unmittelbar zum Rhein hin öffnete, von dem das Institut nur fünf Meter entfernt lag. Zwischen Haus und Strom war nur ein quai-artiger Uferweg, auf dem ein grauer Volkswagen vorgefahren kam. Hinaus stieg der Hellseher mit einem langen Gefolge, alles ältere Leute, offenbar Holländer mit Bärten, die zum Teil neugierig hereindrängten und fragten: "Wo ist er denn?" Dann hörte man Benders in dem Gewirr recht klare Stimme, die über die Versuchsanordnung verhandelte. Die Emme riet mir, mich jetzt an ihn zu wenden, um den Hellseher kennen zu lernen und mit ihm zu experimentieren. Ich ging durch längliche Räume und über Korridore, die ich durch Zwischentüren erreichte, um dem Gefolge des Hellsehers auszuweichen. Der Name des Hellsehers wurde im ersten Wort Simon französisch gesprochen, dann italienisch: Simone de Buconi. (157 words)

Peter begrüsst ihn feierlich, dann verlassen wir beide die Terrasse. Szenenwechsel: Mein Begleiter ist jetzt Hf.. Wir gehen gedankenlos in ein fremdes Haus und dort in einer fremden Wohnung in irgendein Zimmer, wo wir im Dämmerlicht umhertollen, ohne uns Gedanken über den wirklichen Besitzer des Zimmers zu machen. Wir sitzen auf der Couch und kommen in eine spielende Bewegung, bei der wir um eine Achse schwingen. Später erkenne ich aufstehend das Zimmer: Ich bin irgendwann bei der Wohnungssuche, es ist Göttingen, einmal darin gewesen, und zwar wohnte damals dort ein Theologe. An einem seidenen Paravent erkenne ich das Zimmer wieder, und in diesem Moment leuchtet auch die Anordnung der Möbel in der Erinnerung ein. Dann hören wir Schritte und Stimmen. Die Besitzerin des Zimmers, eine Studentin, tritt ein, wobei mir zum ersten Mal die Sonderlichkeit der Situation klar wird. Sie sagt: "Wenn Sie hier einziehen wollen, warten Sie doch wenigstens, bis ich meine Koffer gepackt habe." Ich erkenne daraus, dass das Mädchen ausziehen will und uns für neue Mieter der Wirtin hält. Ich dränge nun an dieser und einer Tante, welche uns wohl noch für einen Besuch des Mädchens halten, schnell vorbei, Hf. mit mir durch den Korridor ziehend, um so die Situation zu retten. Hf. sagt: "Mein Lieber, diese Methode ist nicht ganz richtig." Ich erwidere jedoch, dass es sonst einen furchtbaren Krach gegeben habe. (272 words)

Ich sage neben ihr stehend sehr gelassen: "Vorsicht im Verkehr." Sie scheint jedoch den Polizisten nichts Gutes zu gönnen. Der letzte, schwer lahmende, springt noch im letzten Moment von den Schienen. Man sieht dann die Polizisten auf die Strassen mit zwei Männern beschäftigt, die sich in der Trunkenheit erschlagen haben.

Unsere Emmi geht gleich herauf und sagt den Buben: "Das dürft Ihr aber nicht" usw. Ich gehe inzwischen dem kleinen Jungen nach, der in das Zimmer gelaufen ist und dort in einer Ecke zwischen Buffet und Schrank steht. Ich küsse ihn herzhaft und sehr leidenschaftlich, worauf er anspricht wie eine erwachsene Frau. Sein Gesicht noch kühl und feucht von den Tränen, doch sein Rücken strafft sich und der Körper wölbt sich noch ein wenig mehr, so wie Marion sich hält, die das Kreuz ein wenig hohl hält. Dann schicke ich den Jungen herauf mit den Worten: "Du musst aber nicht gleich mit jeder Kleinigkeit heruntergelaufen kommen". Andere Szene: Ein alter Mann, wohl aus einem Heim, mit einem Strohhut, kommt heran, und jammert er wäre bestohlen worden. Andere Szene: Hf. erzählt von einem alten Mann gleichen Namens wie der, von dem ich weiss, dass man ihm stahl, welcher gestohlen haben soll. Ich bestreite, dass dieser Mann gestohlen haben könne. Dabei spielt offenbar auch die Figur des Kindes hinein, die mit der des Mannes in dieser Szene identifiziert ist. Es stellt sich dann heraus, dass er und der Dieb, trotz des identischen Namens, verschiedene Personen sind. (219 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1057 (1952-10-30 - Freiburg)Ich liege mit Emme nackt auf dem Bett und auch die Gioconda springt nackt im Zimmer herum. Situation der mariage en trois. Zu Emme gehört aber noch ein Mann, der sich hinterher als unangenehm herausstellen wird. Er kommt mit Rivalitätsansprüchen an das Bett heran. Die Szene endet damit, dass seine Bleistifte und Habseligkeiten auf den Fussboden fliegen und ich ihm schliesslich dabei helfe, sie aufzuheben. Vorher noch andere Traumszenen, in der ich Ika (Gioconda) treffe. Die Begegnung ist sehr kurz, doch innig und zum ersten Mal mit dem wirklich elektrisierenden Uberspringen des Funkens im Leiblichen. Sie trägt irgend eine bunte Kleidung um die Brust, die ich ganz leise und flüchtig berühre. Die Farbe des Stoffes, die ins Blaue geht, ist dabei irgendwie entscheidend. Sie hebt sich von einer braunen Haut ab. Der Gesichtsausdruck erinnert wieder an die Schauspielerin Gisela Uhlen. (140 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1058 (1952-10-31 - Freiburg)Traum von einer sehr schönen und sehr eleganten Frau, Engländerin oder Französin, die auf einem Rasthof an der Autobahn mit ihrem kleinen Wagen parkte, und später sich zu uns auf eine Bank setzte, der gegenüber ich auf einem kleinen Mäuerchen mit baumelnden Beinen sass. Sie erzählte von ihrem achtjährigen Sohn: "Er geht schon mit mir ins Bett, das kann er schon." Ich strich mit meinem nackten Fuss an ihrem Bein herunter. Sie streifte ihren Schuh ab, um das Spiel erwidern zu können. Ein aufdringlich wirkendes nacktes Mädchen setzte sich neben sie auf die Bank, obwohl dort viel zu wenig Platz war, drängelnd sich hineinzwängend. Wir nahmen keine Notiz von ihr (110 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1059 (1952-10-31 - Freiburg)Krieg. In merkwürdiger Darstellung. Eine Art Vorhang ist an mächtigen Haken an die Wand gemacht, hinter der der Feind ist. Der Vorhang stellt sozusagen die Verteidigung dar. Irgend ein General ist ungeschickt an die Haken gekommen, die nur lose im Mörtel sassen und nun, lange Spuren in der Mauer hinterlassend, mit einem Teil des Vorhangs herabbrechen. Es ist in irgend einer Weise eine Darstellung der Generalstabsperspektive des Krieges. Ein Kind von jenseits,oder jenseits der Mauer, spielt darin eine Rolle. Es scheint blutig zuzugehen, doch ist meine Erinnerung hier nur schwach. (90 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1060 (1952-10-31 - Freiburg)Ein Film. Am Ende sind die Schauspieler hinter dem durchsichtigen geschlossenen Vorhang zu sehen. Sie klettern eine Leiter hoch, und die erste, ein sehr sexitantes Mädchen, balanciert oben, wo der Vorhang nicht mehr verdeckt, über ein Seil hinweg. Die anderen folgen ihr mühsam nach. Im Zuschauerraum und auch bei mir, der ich mit darin sitze, macht sich die Regung zum Klatschen bemerkbar. Von der Bühne ertönt eine Stimme: "Nicht klatschen. Im Film klatscht man nicht, und dies ist ein Film". (80 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1061 (1952-11-05 - Freiburg)"Reinhard-Ludwig-Maier-Strasse, Palais Bies. - Den ganzen Hegel entlang." Dies war die Adresse, die mir Adenauer sagte. Wir hatten einen sehr guten Film gesehen, über dessen Inhalt ich nichts mehr weiss. Nur dunkel scheint es mir, dass er in eine ähnliche Richtung ging wie etwa: "Andreas Schlüter". In der Vorhalle nach dem Film sah ich Adenauer neben mir stehen mit einer Art Programm oder Aufriss des Films. Er merkte, wie ich auf das Blatt schaute, und wir kamen ins Gespräch. Ich bat ihn, mir das Programm zu leihen. Er: "Jetzt möchte ich es erst noch durchlesen. Aber wenn ich Zeit habe, können wir heute Abend darüber sprechen. Kommen Sie doch am besten mal heute Abend um 19 Uhr." Ich sage: "Ja, wohin?" Er: "In meine Wohnung, Reinhard Ludwig Maier Strasse. Dort wohne ich im Palais Bies. Sie gehen am besten den ganzen Hegel hinauf." Ich denke bei mir: Merkwürdig: ich muss doch über den Rhein und würde denken, den ganzen Rhein entlang (es ist in Bonn) - aber der Hegel scheint eine Strasse zu sein. Er: "Sie können ja einen Polizisten fragen, aber Sie finden es auch so". Ich: "Ja, lieber nicht, der wittert dann gleich Böses." Er: "Ich glaube, wir gehen dann in den Käfig". Ich: "Ich wohne in einem entzückenden Stübchen." Er: "Ja, ich kenne es. Es ist gut, dass niemand aus dem Ministerium darin wohnt." Ich: "Warum?" Er: "Der würde dann den ganzen Tag zu Hause bleiben. Wissen Sie, es (das Stübchen) ist zu sportlich." Während der letzten Sätze geht er schon zu einer Art Theke, um seinen Mantel zu holen. Erwachen. Vorher andere Traumszene: Ich gehe durch die Strassen, in einer Stadt wie München. An einer Kreuzung Verkehrsregelung durch einen französischen Soldaten mit Helm. Er moniert einen deutschen Polizisten, der im Motorrad gegen seinen Wink über die Kreuzung fährt. Zwischen beiden ist eine gespannte Atmosphäre. Es herrscht etwas wie Belagerungszustand. Ich finde mich in der Stadt nicht mehr recht zurecht. Frage nach einer langen Strasse: Es ist die "Detlev-Strasse". Ich erkenne den königlichen Platz. Die Strasse hat, vor allem in ihrer Länge, Ähnlichkeit mit der "Lindwurmstrasse", die zu meiner Schwester führt. Ich mache mich also auf einen langen Weg gefasst. Gehe in einen Bäckerladen. Sehe dort Kuchen in der Struktur wie der sogenannte "gestreifte Affe" oder "kalte Hund". Die Bäckersfrau sagt: "Noch gibt es das alles ohne Marken, bald nicht mehr". Drohender Krieg. Man hört in der Ferne schiessen. Die Situation ist folgende: Die Franzosen haben im letzten Augenblick vor Ratifizierung der Verträge das Saarland mit militärischer Macht besetzt. Adenauer hat daraufhin die ersten Truppen der neuen Bundesarmee einmarschieren lassen. Hieran schloss dann irgendwie die Adenauer-Szene im Traum an. Wahrscheinlich war es so, dass nach einem leichten Erwachen die vergangene Traumszene sich im Traumbewusstsein in eine Filmszene verwandelt hatte. (462 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1062 (1952-11-06, 03:30 - Freiburg)Traum von Ernst Jünger. Besuch bei ihm. Wir liegen auf einer Wiese im Garten, oder besser Rasen, um ein winziges Teichlein oder Becken herum. Er sagt von sich: "Der Jünger hat in der letzten Zeit nicht mehr so viel von Schlangen geträumt". Ich deute: Das passt auch nicht mehr so gut zu dem, was er jetzt schreibt und sage: "Bei Jünger habe ich kürzlich das und das gelesen", dann: "übrigens habe ich heute Nacht von Ihnen geträumt". Er: "Oh, das interessiert mich. Bender hat mich übrigens darauf hingewiesen, dass ihre Träume viele Deutungshinweise geben. Der Träumer braucht sich nicht zu beklagen, hat er gesagt, weil in seinen Träumen selbst die Hinweise sind." Ich: "Ich kann Ihnen den Traum mal vorlesen". Ich laufe nun auf der Suche nach der letzten Traumaufzeichnung auf der Wiese umher, dabei immer um das winzig blaue Becken kreisend, wo meine Handschriftblätter in kleinen Stapeln liegen. Ich kann das Blatt nicht gleich finden. Jünger sagt: "So werden wieder kostbare Minuten verloren. Diese neue Emmi scheint auch das Essen nicht zu bringen." Im Erwachen (draussen ist starker Sturm, der mich Nachts geweckt hat) fällt mir ein, dass die Traumblätter hinter meinem Kopf liegen. Im dort Hinschauen beschliesse ich, diesen Traum aufzuschreiben. Vorher noch etwas, was um Sartre und Ek-sistenz geht. (212 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1063 (1952-11-07 - Freiburg)Vor der Gartentür ist ein Wagen mit unklar uniformierten Leuten vorgefahren, anscheinend eine Art von Polizei, die Gebärden des Verhaftens mir gegenüber machen. Dabei fangen sie aber an, mich zu zwicken und höhnisch zu schikanieren. Ich protestiere energisch und weise sie darauf hin, dass sie Hüter der Ordnung seien. Das vermehrt nur ihren Hohn, und einer von ihnen antwortet spöttisch und achselzuckend: "Wie kann man sowas von der Gestapo erwarten." Dann folgt mir das ganze Volk lamentierend und höhnisch in den Käfig. Ich erwache mit dem Gelüste, das Ganze in die Luft zu sprengen. (94 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1064 (1952-11-07 - Freiburg)Ich steige mit der Emme die Treppen der Universität hinan, die schlossartig vielstöckig und mit Galerien versehen ist. Es sind barocke Doppeltreppen. Wir finden elegante Nebentreppen, die uns zuweilen ein wenig höher als die Stockwerke führen. So enden wir schliesslich auf einer Aussengalerie, die einen wunderbaren Ausblick auf die Stadt Freiburg und ihre Gewässer erschliesst, der uns zu Tränen rührt. Freiburg ist hier eine Seestadt mit Gewässern von blauer Farbe (etwa wie Köln). (73 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1065 (1952-11-07 - Freiburg)Spaziergang mit Emme. Wir treffen Marion. Während Emme in den Käfig geht, spreche ich mit Marion, die ihre Lebenssituation erzählt: Vieles hätte sich wieder ins Gleichgewicht verlagert: Bezogen auf Peter und einen Mann, von dem sie erzählt, er habe sie küssen wollen, was sie zurückgewiesen habe. Ich gab Marion einen ganz leichten Kuss auf die Backe, dann ging sie fort, doch verharrte noch einmal und rief leise: "Komme!" Ich kam, und wir fielen uns in die Arme und küssten uns sehr leidenschaftlich. Ich dachte dabei einmal daran, dass jetzt die Emme aus dem Käfig herauskommen und dies sehen würde. Doch störte mich dies nicht. (104 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1066 (1952-11-09 - Freiburg)"Dies ist echter holländischer Magenlikör" sagte in meinem Traum jemand zu einer weisslichen Flüssigkeit, die an einer Theke eingeschenkt wurde. Dann unter anderem von einem Äffchen, das an der Tür klingelte und hereinkam und allerhand Kunststücke vormachte. Als ich fragte, ob es auch einen Turm aus Bauklötzchen bauen könnte, war es resigniert: Es hatte keinen Dingbegriff. Dann von einem eifersüchtigen Besucher. Er brachte zwei Messer mit, ein grades und ein sichelartig gebogenes. Mit letzterem hieb er auf sich selbst ein, um seine Schärfe zu demonstrieren, wobei die geschlagene Haut aufklappte. Dann Fahrt mit einer Strassenbahn. An einem überschwemmenden Fluss entlang, der gerade noch die Uferstrasse frei lässt. Ein Mädchen erzählt aus Russland, wo sie nicht nur in Gefangenschaft , sondern schon irgendwie als Militaise beschäftigt war. Sie ist Deutschrussin. (129 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1067 (1952-11-10 - Freiburg)Lektüre von Rilke: "Die 'grosse Pause' mitten im Literaturverzeichnis ist etwas, worin jemand möglichst niemals etwas lesen wird." Gedacht so: Das Verzeichnis (eigentlich als ein solches des Inhalts) mitten im Buche, in zwei Abteilungen. Inmitten darin eine Pause, in der niemand liest: als schöpferische Pause. Dann Lektüre von einzelnen Rilkeschen Aufsätzen, so über einen Autor Fritz Jünger, der wohl etwas über das Energieprinzip gesagt haben soll -- doch ist das Ganze, philosophisch betrachtet, etwas im Stile Heideggers. So spricht denn Rilke hier auch schon von Geschichte des Seins, was mich sehr verwundert. -- Alle diese Lektüre im Zimmer der Baumgärtnerin (auf einer Couch liegend, während diese auf ihrem Bett liegt). Dann steht sie auf, um "sich umzubetten", das heisst: ins "grüne Zimmer" überzusiedeln. Erwachen. - Später anderer Traum: Blick durch ein Kirchenfenster in die Sakristei, in der ein Hund bellt. Angst. Fort in die Gasse. Diese scheint eine Sackgasse zu sein. Furcht, noch einmal an dem Hund vorbei zu müssen. Da zeigt sich am Ende der Gasse rechts eine niedrige Tür, die in eine Reihe von hofartigen Gängen führt, das Innere von alten Häusern, welche jeweils etwas steigen und schliesslich hinausführen auf eine Parallelgasse. Dort im ersten Haus wohnen Ungarn. Ungarische Offiziere, die dort heiter sind und trinken. Dann gehe ich weiter. Ein paar Häuser weiter wohnt Christian Ferber, den ich in seiner Stube besuche. Er bietet mir Tausch mit dem Käfig an. Ich will aber in diesem bleiben. Auch Gisela wohnt in der Nähe. Dann andere Szene: In der Schweiz nach einer Anhalterfahrt von Dänemark nach Basel. Dort in einer Jugendherberge. Man fragt uns: "Wollt Ihr noch Nudeln essen?" Ich danke -- aus einer Art Bescheidenheit. Dann bietet man uns Pfannkuchen an, und hierbei wächst mein Appetit. Ich bitte darum. Doch da man Nudeln schon fertig hat, gibt man uns mit einem bedauerlichen Achselzucken Nudeln. (306 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1068 (1952-11-11 - Freiburg)Traum von vielen unendlich feinen Holzschnitzereien, Bäumchen und Figürchen, zum grossen Teil verpackt in kleinen glatt polierten Holzschreinen, die alle zusammen das Panorama einer Neckarlandschaft, wie sich nachher zeigte, Heidelberg, darstellten. Ich bekam es geschickt. Ein Brief war dabei, es war nicht zu entscheiden, ob in Ikas oder Marions Schrift. Ich packte alles mit Emme aus. Später war Marion im Käfig. Sie gab mir einen Wertpapierschein, den sie mir schenkte. Ich sagte: "Du schenkst mir etwas, wovon Du gar nicht weisst, wieviel es wert ist." Es war eine Art Verlegenheitsrede ob des Beschenktseins. Sie sagte: "Jeder Pfennig davon ist genau einen Pfennig wert." -- Dann Volksdorf: Dort aber nicht Ika, sondern Gisela bei Maetzels wohnend, und zwar in der Glasveranda, die sie hier bei Köhler bewohnte. Aus dieser hatten Maetzels sie rausgesetzt, was uns sehr verwunderte. Es stand jedoch dahinter eine Geschichte mit dem Wohnungsamt. Andere, aber frühere Szenen: Ging durch eine endlose Flucht schlossartiger, parkettausgelegter Räume, auf ein Zimmer zu, das Christian von Ferber bewohnte. Doch kam er mir schon eiligst entgegen mit einem Kochgeschirr, um in die Mensa zu gehen, und sagte: "Weisst Du nicht, dass es fast schon zu spät ist?" Ich eilte hinter ihm her. Auch Specht und Hf. spielten noch eine Rolle. Dann ein Gespräch mit Emme. Ich sagte: "Die Kultur muss entsexualisiert werden -- und zwar so, dass man sich auslebt." Sie war aber der Meinung, dass in diesem Ausleben die Kultur vielmehr nur mehr mit sexuellen Elementen durchsetzt werden würde. (247 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1069 (1952-11-12 - Freiburg)Ich stöberte bei einem Antiquar ein Bild im Stile des Rokoko auf. Im Mittelpunkt eine Frauenfigur vor einer ausgebreiteten Landschaft. Zweite Szene: Kinder verwischen das Bild. Ich stelle sie hinzukommend zur Rede und führe sie vor das Bild zurück, um ihnen zu zeigen, was sie angerichtet haben. Dritte Szene: Ich sehe eine Versammlung des Kunstvereins vor dem Bilde stehen. Ein Maler, namens B., erklärt das Bild. Ich bleibe zunächst aus einer gewissen Scheu zurück, trete dann aber hinzu, als ich mich besinne, dass mir das Bild gehört, und bemerke, dass der Maler, während der Beschreibung die verwischten Linien und Flächen mit einem Pinsel wieder nachzieht -- aber in seinem Stil, wobei er den Rokoko-Charakter des Bildes völlig zerstört hat, zum Beispiel die Frau übermalt, und ein langweiliges modern-romantisches Bild (etwa im Stil der Münchner Schule) daraus gemacht hat. Ich bin empört, denn das Bild gehört ja mir. -- Vierte Szene: Ein Renovator stellt das Bild in alter Form wieder her. (160 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1070 (1952-11-12 - Freiburg)Zwei Mädchen wollen zur gleichen Zeit, jede gern mit mir ins Bett gehen. Die eine ist temperamentvoll, ein wenig rötlich-blonde Haare, aber noch sehr jung und unausgereift in ihrem Wesen, sieht aus wie Gertie, die andere eine ruhigere oder reifere Frau.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1072 (1952-11-13 - Freiburg)B. hält ein Bordell, mit dessen Erträgen er sein Institut finanziert. Ich gehe mit ihm durch den Raum, der wie eine Schulklasse wirkt, um ein Mädchen für mich auszusuchen. Wir umrunden dabei einmal ganz den Raum. B. geht dabei, die Hände auf dem Rücken, im konzilianten Gespräch neben mir. Ich suche ein schwarzes Mädchen aus. Während des Ganges wird mir klar, warum B. oft so lange vom Institut abwesend ist. Er ist mir als guter Geschäftsmann bekannt. So leuchtet mir diese Art der Finanzierung ein. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1073 (1952-11-13 - Freiburg)Ein sehr grosses Flugzeug in der Luft. Zwei andere sagen, dass sie damit jetzt nach Amerika fliegen wollten. Emme und ich fragen uns, wie das möglich sei, wenn man kein Geld hat. Andere Szene: Ich sehe in einer Zeitung ein Reklamebild mit einem nackten Mann, der genau meinen Körperbau und meine Glieder hat, sehr schmalgliedrig und mit weiter runtergehenden Rippen wie ein Windhund. Ich nehme an, dass einer der Maler, der mich als Modell kennt, das Bild gemacht hat. Dem Bild ist aber in dem Zeitungsfetzen der Kopf abgerissen. Ich suche nun den anderen Fetzen, um zu sehen, ob es auch mein Kopf ist. Dann finde ich ihn: Es ist aber ein anderes, lachendes Reklamegesicht, wie etwa bei den Reklamen der Gilette-Rasierklingen. (122 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1074 (1952-11-13 - Freiburg)Hf. mit einem riesen Zettel von Bekannten, einem Art Verein, steht vor der Haustür. Ich begrüsse ihn, noch das gelbe Wolltuch um den Kopf gebunden, das ich tatsächlich heute Morgen gegen den Zug vom Fenster her im Käfig um den Kopf band, und sage ihm: "Ich würde Sie gerne mit allen Ihren Bekannten heraufnehmen, aber ich kann es nicht, weil die Bewohner, besonders Gesine, schon schlafen." Er sagt: "Es wäre natürlich sehr schön. Man könnte so gut mit dem Käfig renommieren." (81 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1075 (1952-11-14 - Freiburg)Ich betrachte in einem Schaukasten des "Casino" Bilder eines Revuefilms mit sehr vielen nackten Frauenbeinen, weiter unten sehe ich auch das Bild einer völlig nackten Frau, die ein wenig zurückgelehnt mit aufgestützten Armen und ausgestreckten Beinen da sitzt, so dass der Blick auf die Schamhaare gelenkt wird. Die Strasse ist so eng, dass ich, um die Bilder zu betrachten, auf der anderen Seite der Strasse mit dem Rücken ebenfalls an einen Schaukasten gelehnt bin. Eine Frau im Pelzmantel kommt vorbei und stützt sich im Vorbeigehen, gleichsam wie an der Wand, mit der flachen Hand auf meine Brust und sagt dabei etwas über das Tastgefühl, das sie dabei auf meinem mattgelben Hemd hat. Ich fasse in ihren Pelzmantel und ziehe sie zu mir und sage: "Komm, Du Teddybär" und küsse sie. Sie sagt: "Warum Teddybär?" -- Ich: "Wegen Deines Fells". Nach dem Kuss -- eine ältere Begleiterin, die neben ihr war, ist inzwischen am Weitergehen, fragt sie mich: "Na und?...was ist nun? Wann treffen wir uns?" Ich sage: "Wollen mal sehen, vielleicht heute Abend" und erwache mit dem Gedanken, wie ich dann zwei zugleich in meinem Bett unterbringen soll, Emme und sie. (191 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1076 (1952-11-15 - Freiburg)Szilasi als Lehrer. In derselben Schule befindet sich auch ein Sex-Room. Man hört die Geräusche von dort. Später wische ich den Boden auf dem Speicher vor dem Käfig mit einem Tuch auf. Andere Szene: Im Schulraum ist ein Wasserhahn über einem Becken, den ich laufen lasse. Beim Abstellen zerbricht er oder geht aus den Fugen. Es gibt eine Überschwemmung, denn das Wasser läuft weiter, soviel ich auch drehe, und zwar auf den Parkettfussboden. Ich suche verzweifelt den Haupthahn, den ich auch schliesslich finde und abstelle, aber nun brennt das Gas, das mit dem fliessenden Wasser gekoppelt ist, zur Erwärmung, trotzdem weiter, und ich muss befürchten, dass die ganze Anlage in die Luft fliegt, da alle kleinen Hähne nicht schliessen. Zu guter Letzt finde ich auch hier den Haupthahn. Nach alledem gehe ich daran, den Parkettfussboden aufzuwischen. Schüler aus dem Nebenraum, die ich zur Hilfe gerufen hatte, konnten nicht so schnell herbeikommen. Andere Szene: Mein Bruder erzählt, dass er in Szilasis Vorlesung das Fenster geöffnet und dieser sich gegen die Störung gewandt habe. Ich erinnere mich selbst der Vorlesung, und beschwichtige ihn, da diese Dinge bei Szilasi nicht so gefährlich sind. Szilasi wandte sich in der Vorlesung auch gegen die Sex-Rooms, die er unnatürlich fand. (204 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1083 (1952-11-24 - Freiburg)Traum von meinem Bruder. Auf meinem Nachttisch stand eine Lampe mit Pergamentschirm, die ihm gehörte. Er verbot mir, um sie zu schonen, sie anzuzünden. Ich trug sie wütend zu ihm in sein Bett und holte eine andere, schwarze Bürolampe aus der anderen Etage des Nachttisches hervor. Er stellte ironisch fest, dass auch diese Lampe ihm gehöre. Ich brachte ihm wütend auch diese Lampe und mit der Mine: Ich brauche Deine Lampe nicht. Doch jede weitere, die ich hervorsuchte, gehörte ebenfalls ihm. So hatte ich schliesslich keine mehr. In der nächsten Szene wiederholte sich fast dieselbe Situation mit Emmi. Hier ging es um eine Kaffeemühle, die ich schliesslich wütend an den alten Platz zurück mehr warf als stellte. In der dritten Szene war Emme da, die meine Wut irgendwie teilte und deshalb nicht bei uns, sondern in einem Zimmer in der Nähe schlafen wollte. (143 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1084 (1952-11-26 - Freiburg)Am Fussende des Bettes ist ein neues Fenster in den Käfig gebrochen, so dass er zu ebener Erde in eine herrliche Schneelandschaft führt. Ich habe Lust, nackt hinaus zu laufen, in den Schnee. Da sehe ich ein Kaninchen draussen vor dem grossen Glasfenster. Doch als ich näher herantrete, gewahr ich, dass es eine merkwürdig lange rüsselartige Schnauze hat. Es muss ein Wildschwein sein. Auch entdecke ich zwei Elefantenartige Stosszähne, und das ganze Tier hat die Bedrohlichkeit und Grösse fast eines Nashorns. Ich erwarte nun jeden Moment, dass das Tier durch das Fenster in den Käfig hineinstossen wird, und bereite mich auf die Flucht vor, fieberhaft in meiner Hosentasche neben dem Bett, wo die Hose heute -- anstatt auf dem Stuhl wie sonst -- liegt, den Schlüssel zur unteren Etage zu suchen (was nicht gelingen will). Ich muss ihn aber haben, sonst folgt mir das Nashorn ins Treppenhaus und ich bin verloren. Inzwischen hat sich das Tier vom Fenster abgewendet, ist aber eine kleine Treppe hinaufgelaufen, die es auf anderem Wege in den Flur vor den Käfig bringen muss, so dass mir der Fluchtweg abgeschnitten ist.

Unten vom See her kommt eine Kolonne von Männern und Frauen. Die Frauen sind zum Teil nur mit schwarzen Schleiern bekleidet, die sich nur vor der Scham und vor den Brüsten zur Undurchsichtigkeit verdichten. Auch ein Teil der Männer ist ähnlich bekleidet. Irgend jemand fällt vorne in das Loch hinein und wird schwer angeschlagen wieder herausgezogen. (82 words)

Und dazu eine Zeichnung von offenbar einem Weg durch eine Tür, und verschiedene Personen sind dazu gezeichnet, und unter denen steht: Onkel Adolf, Grossvater, von Uslar alt. Bollnow jun. -- Mittlere Schicht: Im Treppenhaus. Die Beckerin küsst mich liebkost meine Haare -- halb im Spass (vielleicht Verabredung). Dann Umarmung. Immer heftiger. Dritte Schicht: Suche Klo, alte Uni. erinnere mich an untere Etage, gehe drein. Auch dazu im handschriftlichen Text eine Zeichnung, die man aber nicht erkennen kann. Anschliessend: Nachträgliche Ausführung am 8.12.1952: Letzte Traumschicht dicht vor dem Erwachen. Liege im Bett. Neben mir im anderen Bett Onkel Adolf ("Familienpapst"). Rechts steht mein Grossvater, aber nicht mit weissen Haaren, wie ich ihn nur kenne, sondern mit schwarzen. Irgend etwas, dessen ich mich heute nicht mehr erinnere, bringt mich zur Wut. Ich muss einen Eimer hinaustragen. Durch eine Tür. Hierbei Szenenwechsel: Es handelt sich um Rechnungen. Es scheint sich um ein Geschäft gehandelt zu haben mit "von Uslar alt und Bollnow jun." als Inhaber. Ich führe ein Gespräch dort, in dem der Satz vorkommt (bezogen auf dieses Geschäft): "Grossvater Adolf wollte alles selbst machen". Mittlere Schicht: Also eine davorliegende Traumschicht, die als zweite in die Erinnerung kam: Im Treppenhaus (wohl der alten Universität, wo ich Tags zuvor im Psychologischen Institut war). Die Beckerin küsst mich, liebkost meine Haare -- halb wie im Spass (vielleicht Verabredung), dann Umarmung -- immer heftiger. Dritte Schicht: am witesten zurückliegende Traumschicht: Ich suche ein Klo in der alten Universität.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1092 (1952-12-06 - Freiburg)Letzte Szene einer langen Traumkette, die ich im übrigen, wie meist jetzt morgens, nach einer langen Beschäftigung mit ihren Bildern wieder vergessen habe. Ich gehe über eine Strasse, an deren gegenüberliegender Seite viele Schienen verlaufen, an denen gebaut wird, so dass der Verkehr auf der restlichen Strasse für die Autos etwas beengt ist. Im Hintergrund schaue ich nach einem Mädchen, das einen roten Pullover trägt, der in einer unregelmässigen Form so durchbrochen ist, dass die in den Lücken durchschimmernde Hautfarbe ein exzentrisches Muster malt. Ich muss -- in die Betrachtung versunken -- einen Sprung machen, um einem von rechts kommenden Auto auszuweichen. (102 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1094 (1952-12-08 - Freiburg)Vater bittet mich, zu Heidegger zu gehen (der am Ende unserer Strasse in Schwerin -- also eigentlich da, wo Hildebrands Haus war -- wohnt) und ihm zu sagen, dass etwas Wichtiges in den Nachrichten sei. Heidegger höre nämlich die Nachrichten nur Abends und müsse sie heute auch Mittags hören. Ich bestritt, dass Heidegger die Nachrichten nur Abends höre, und wollte darum nicht hingehen. Auch hatte mein Vater schon eine Arteriosklerose. Fast gleichzeitig mit dieser eine andere Traumszene zwischen Adelheid und Vater, in der eine Ohrfeige ein Rolle spielt, und zwar so, dass, glaube ich, sie ihm eine gibt. Er war sehr wütend. Andere Szene: Essen. Vater eine Etage höher, hat Arteriosklerose, will nicht mehr essen. Ich schlage vor, ihn nicht zum Essen zu zwingen, da das unnatürlich und eine krankhafte Lebensverlängerung sei. Andere Szene: Emme ist da und berichtet, dass ihre Schwerster Gärtli zu Weihnachten kommen solle. Ich freue mich darüber. Andere Szene: Im Hause eine Art Privatzoo. Ich sitze bei dem Dompteur auf einer Pritsche. Der Elefant läuft im Zimmer herum. Als er aufbegehren will, springt der Dompteur hoch, mit ausgestreckten Armen, und heischt Ruhe. Er erzählt mir, dass man erwogen habe, dem Elefanten die Zähne beweglich anzubringen, so dass sie beim Stoss seitlich abgleiten. Dann hat er da auch eine sehr schöne zierliche Schlange, die in Zuckungen in die Luft springt. Ich erkläre dem Dompteur, dass ich vor ihr Angst habe. Dieses Angstgefühl sei rein reflektorisch, sozusagen physiologisch bedingt. Der Sohn des Hauses kommt herein. Der Elefant paradiert vor ihm. Er hat ein Wesen bei sich, das zunächst aussieht wie ein Igel, sich dann aber als die Schwester herausstellt, die ein Igelkäppchen aufhat. Ich bin entzückt und küsse sie ganz selbstverständlich beim Begrüssen auf den Mund, den sie mir fast mit derselben Gebärde wie die Hand zum Gruss bietet. In der ganzen Bewegung ist zugleich etwas verhalten Liebevolles. Dann die Mutter, die noch jung, aber bestimmt und energisch wirkt. Freundliche Begrüssung. Sie meint, mein Besuch sei ganz ohne gegenseitige Verbindlichkeit. Andere Szene: Ich schreibe in dem Jungenszimmer meines Elternhauses einen Brief an Emme. Andere Szene: Ein Jurist begleitet mich in Schwerin den Arsenalberg hinauf und erinnert an unsere Bekanntschaft, deren ich mich nicht mehr entsinne. Es sei eine Übung übers BGB gewesen. Er habe damals meine Ratschläge befolgt. Ich bin erstaunt, da dies Gebiet gar nicht zu meinem Fach gehört. (392 words)

Der Sinn der Worte war folgender: Ich möchte nicht gestört werden, von anderen meinetwegen -- die können hereinkommen -- aber von Dir nicht..."weil Du..." ging der Satz dann weiter und dann kam irgendeine Begründung, die ich jetzt vergessen habe, die mich aber so tief kränkte, dass ich weinen musste.

Er fasst seine Gedanken zusammen in zwei Grundsätzen, deren einen ich vergesse habe. Der andere war: polemos pater panton (Im handschriftlichen Text griechisch geschrieben). Er meint das Wort nicht nur im landläufigen, nur politischem Sinne: "Der Krieg als der Vater aller Dinge", sondern auch im strengen philosophischen Sinne Heraklits. Der Eindruck, den diese kluge Rede auf mich macht, ist ein grosser. Der Redner stellt fest, dass jeder Russe sehr bald deutsch sprechen könne, aber selten Deutsche Russisch.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1124 (1953-01-06 - Freiburg)Ich treffe Bismarck, den ich ehrerbietig begrüsse, und gehe mit ihm durch einen Raum, in dem wir einen Mann treffen, den er mir als Hindenburg vorstellt. Der Mann ist jedoch fett, fast ohne Übergang von Kinn zu Hals und wie ein Walross. Er erinnert eher an einen gutmütigen, aber etwas grossspurigen Ladenbesitzer. Ich bin erstaunt über dieses Staatsoberhaupt, aber doch zugleich erfüllt von gebührender, etwas steifer Ehrfurcht. Gehe jedoch danach erleichtert in Bismarks frischer plaudernder Begleitung durch den Raum. Die Szene wechselt dabei unmerklich, der Raum ist wie eine Klasse mit Schulbänken erfüllt, in der ein evangelischer Pfarrer oder Lehrer Vortrag hält. Mit meinem Begleiter, der inzwischen die Gestalt eines Kollegen oder Schulkameraden angenommen hat, gehe ich an den Wänden entlang hinter den Bänken, so dass der gesamte Gang in beiden Traumszenen jetzt einmal das Quadrat des Raums umschritten hat, und trete durch eine Tür in den Nachbarraum ein, ebenfalls eine Schulklasse, es ist meine Klasse, in der der katholische Theologe Bernhard Welte gerade in seiner frischen Art eine Unterrichtsstunde beendet hat und in seinem schwarz-weissen Anzug des Geistlichen vom Katheder herabsteigt. Meine Klassenkameraden begrüssen mich und sagen mir, dass ich ein Paket bekommen habe. Ich gehe wieder um die Bänke herum zu meinem Platz und packe dann mit meinem Schulkameraden Detlev Hollmann, der mir ob des gleichen Namens immer ein wenig nahe war, ein paar Bänke weiter vorne das Paket aus. Es kommt von der befreundeten Landfamilie von v. Vieregge-Steinhausen, bei der wir immer die Pfingstferien verbrachten. Ich sehe auf der Rückseite des Pakets auf dem Packpapier eine alte durchgestrichene Adresse an Conny v. Vieregge-Randow, den Adoptivsohn, der das Gut erben sollte. In dem Paket finde ich eine Hose, die ich schon im Auspacken als eine sehr schicke amerikanische Stepphose erkenne, über die ich mich sehr freue. Dann scheint es einen Augenblick, als ob das auf der Rückseite nur eine einfache amerikanische Militärhose sei, die man blau gefärbt hatte, doch merke ich bald, dass man diese nur als Unterlage benützt hatte und ich die unrechte Seite der Hose gesehen hatte.

Ich bin ungehalten, dass, als ich an die Schleuse, eine Art Ziel des Schwimmens, komme, kein Fischer da ist, um mit dem Netz die Tierchen einzufangen. Ich hätte Nachricht geben müssen, wann sie kommen. So gehen sie, die zugleich immer noch Fadennudeln sind, verloren. Andere Szene: Hochsteigen in einem Gebäude. Die Szene schliesst an die vorige an. Der Übergang ist so, als ob sich das Gebäude in seiner Senkrechten über die Waagerechte der vorigen Szene aufbaute. Das heisst aber, aufbauen übereinander tun sich so nur die Szenen im Wechsel, die erste bleibt in der zweiten nicht erinnert. Es ist eine Universität. Man kommt herein durch einen Art Schaufenstergang, dem luxuriöse Geschäfte wie zur Lockung anliegen. Eingang durch eine elegante Glastür in die Uni. Drinnen Treppen. Dann vielfacher Szenenwechsel. Hier habe ich die Einzelheiten vergessen. Es handelt sich immer wieder um Hinauf- und Hinabsteigen und Lagern.

Anderer Traum von einem kleinen schwarzen Hund, der ein spitzes krokodilartiges Maul hatte, das wegen des fehlenden Kinns sozusagen bösartig und charakterlos wirkte. Ich hatte grosse Angst vor ihm, und er verfolgte mich um das ganze Haus herum. Keine Tür konnte ich rechtzeitig vor ihm schliessen, immer schon war er vorher mir zwischen den Beinen. Einmal, ich ging möglichst unauffällig, war er noch ein langes Wegstück hinter mir, ich versuchte nun, mit einigen Sprüngen mich auf jeden Fall durch eine Tür in Sicherheit zu bringen, doch er bemerkte mein auffälliges Laufen und kam wie ein Pfeil herangeschossen. Anderen Menschen war er offenbar ungefährlich, denn ich sah jemand, der ihn streichelte. Nur Emme, die mit dem Rad den Steinweg durch den Garten hinaus ging (es war im Elternhaus im Schwerin) warnte ich vor ihm, weil sie immer Angst vor Hunden hat. Einmal gelang es mir, die Kellertür gerade noch vor ihm zu schliessen, als er mit zwei anderen Hunden auf der Zementplattform war. Die beiden anderen, unter ihnen ein sehr schöner Schäferhund, taten mir leid, weil sie gerne in das Haus wollten. Doch kaum hatte ich die Tür verschlossen, da wühlte sich einer der anderen Hunde oben durch die Mauer, direkt durch die Fugen des Steins. Ein Bein blieb ihm dabei stecken, er lief ohne es weiter, wie ein Spielzeugtier, dem man Schwanz und Beine herausziehen kann. Der Anblick war grausig, und mich ergriff das Mitleid. Doch musste ich sofort auch die zweite Tür schliessen, um mich vor dem gefährlichen dritten Hund zu schützen, der offenbar auch durch die Mauer gekommen wäre. Ich rannte die Kellertreppe hinauf.

Aus dem schrägen Dachfenster meines Käfigs sehe ich auf die bemützten Köpfe von Polizisten, die dort ihren Stab aufgeschlagen haben. Und zwar ist entweder das Haus so niedrig, oder ihre Plattform so hoch, dass sie fast in das Fenster greifen können. Sie sind von meiner kleinen roten Badehose irritiert, die am Fenster aufgehängt ist, die sie aber nicht als solche erkennen und sagen: "Nehmen sie die Fahne da weg." Szenenwechsel: Ein Mann kommt -- wohl durch das Fenster -- herein, um in freundlicher Absicht etwas zu verstecken, etwa wie man Ostereier versteckt. Ich lasse ihn gewähren, er scheint mich nicht zu sehen. Dann kommt mein Bruder durch die Tür herein, begegnet ihm und sagt im Nachsehen: "Den müsste ich eigentlich kennen." Mein Bruder hat inzwischen im Käfig gewohnt und betrachtet ihn offenbar wie den seinen. Ich habe gerade mein Bett frisch bezogen. Er rückt etwas am Bett zurecht, stellt ein Tischchen, das er auch vorher dort hatte, wieder unter das Kopfende, damit es höher sei, und beschwert sich, alles sei durcheinander. Ich bin empört, es sei doch mein Bett und mein Zimmer, er solle sein Bett gefälligst daneben aufschlagen. -- Er nimmt überhaupt keine Notiz davon und betrachtet das Bett einfach als seines. Ich laufe zunächst verzweifelt zu meiner Schwester und sage: "Ich will heute Nacht hier bei Dir schlafen." Dann aber steigt die Wut in mir hoch, ich schlage mit der Faust auf einen schwarzen Tisch und presse, obwohl mir fast die Stimme versagt, wütend heraus: "Es ist doch mein Bett, es ist doch mein Bett."

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1140 (1953-01-18 - Freiburg)Anderer Traum spielt in einem Seminar über Träume. Wir sitzen um einen Tisch und stellen über eine Traumfigur, von der ein Bild auf dem Tisch liegt, einen Mann, der wie ein römischer Legionär nur teilweise bekleidet ist und teilweise nackte Haut zeigt, fest: dass die nackte Haut Haltung symbolisiert, weil man unter der Haut das Spiel der Muskeln sieht -- die Kleidung dagegen symbolisiert Halt. So muss man also Halt und Haltung in der Deutung unterscheiden. Die Kleidung liegt an wie ein Panzer, die die untere Wölbung des Brustkorbes und den Zwerchfellboden freilässt. In einer anderen Szene liegt ein Buch auf dem Tisch, in rotem Einband, das in dem Traumseminar unter Leitung von Bender herausgegeben worden ist. Wir sprechen darüber. Die Gestalt Benders ist sehr deutlich in der Traumszene. (129 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1141 (1953-01-21 - Freiburg)Gespräch mit dem Germanisten Rehm, der mir, im Traum als Dekan (in Wirklichkeit war er es in den vergangenen Semestern nicht mehr), meine Doktorarbeit, wie er mit Szilasi verabredet hat, noch einmal zurückgab, damit ich sie weiter ausarbeite. Er sagte, er habe einen Unterschied zum Webetanz -- den habe er auch gelesen (ich wunderte mich darüber) -- festgestellt, denn dort sei noch die Beziehung zum Anderen ungeteilt glückhaft, hier aber, in der Arbeit, gebe es schon Selbstvorwürfe (das heisst jene Einsicht in die Möglichkeit der Unmöglichkeit) -- er sagte das nicht mit diesen Worten, doch war dies der Sinn der Rede im Traum. Er wollte wissen, ob es verschiedene Personen seien, zu denen bei den beiden Schriften "der Hang bestanden habe" (wie er sich ausdrückte). Ich sagte: "Sie ist eben nur selbst inzwischen reifer geworden." (135 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1142 (1953-01-21 - Freiburg)Gespräch mit Bender in seinem Institut. Als ich das Haus verlasse, hängt draussen eine schwere Gewitterwolke. Ich mache mich trotzdem auf den Weg, weil ich hoffe, die Strassenbahn auf den steilen Pfaden den Berg hinab noch vor dem Gewitter zu erreichen. Dann kommt aber doch schon unterwegs ein Platzregen. Ich ziehe meine Hose und meine Jacke aus, nehme sie über den Arm und geniesse. (64 words)

Die Angreifer kommen durch einen schmalen Gang, der durch Häuser durch draussen führt, entgegen. Andere Szene: In Schwerin unter östlicher Prägung, in der Friedrichstrasse, ein Mann steht am Fenster eines oberen Stockwerkes, zieht sich lässig Jacke und Schlips aus, und stürzt sich dann hinab auf die Strasse, und zwar im Schlusssprung, man sieht ihn unten landen, sich noch einmal aufrichten und dann zusammenbrechen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1144 (1953-01-22 - Freiburg)Der Traum ist nur durch eine Zeichnung und dazu geschriebene Stichworte angedeutet und zwar steht zuerst: "Erstens" und dann das Wort Lokomotive, darunter sieht man eine Lokomotive und einen angehängten Wagen, unter dem "Postwagen" steht, und vor der Lokomotive einen Mann, der ruft: "Halt". Daneben sieht man ein Gebüsch mit der Unterschrift "Büsche und Zaun". Dann kommt die Zahl "Zweitens", und hier sieht man, gezeichnet, einen Reiter auf einem Pferd sitzen und daneben steht: "Pferd, zu hoch geschnallte Bügel, kann nicht galoppieren." Und dann kommt die Zahl "Drittens", und hier sieht man ein aus der Vogelschau erkennbares Auto, das eine Kurve fährt, die durch einen Pfeil angedeutet ist, und daneben steht: "Auto, amerikanisch, gross. Kann Bremse nicht finden, steuere um Kurve. Scharfe Kurve bergab". Und dann sieht man in dem Auto eine Figur, in der steht "Ego", und daneben sieht man eine Figur stehen, und neben der steht: "Emme". Und am Ende der offenbar bergab führenden Kurve sieht man wieder das Auto und daneben das Wort "Stop" und die Zeichnung eines aus der Vogelschau gesehen Hauses. (176 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1145 (1953-01-26 - Freiburg)Traum, in dem es sich um ost-westliche Spannungen handelte. Ein gegnerisches Flugzeug war von einer der beiden Parteien, sozusagen wie ein toter Vogel in der Luft aufgehängt worden. Es hing dort gleichsam an einer imaginären Leine. Das war ein Zeichen des Krieges. Einzelheiten weiss ich nicht mehr, doch meine ich, dass die Szene in Berlin oder an der Zonengrenze spielte und ein Flugfeld eine Rolle spielte. Andere Szene: Ein junger Flieger stürzt mit einem Art Hubschrauber sich ins Wasser hinab. Es ist eine sportliche Angelegenheit. Wir fahren in einem Boot und ziehen ihn bei der Gelegenheit aus dem Wasser heraus. Er hat von dem Sturz her eine unerhörte Geschwindigkeit, die ihn mit aller Wucht in Richtung auf das Ufer zuschnellt. Ich halte ihn, so gut es geht, vom Boot aus fest, auch zieht er dabei noch das Gewicht unseres Bootes mit, so dass der Aufprall am Ufer-Mäuerchen, das dem Beckenrande eines Schwimmbades gleicht, gemildert wird. Der Flieger trägt eine Badekappe, ist jung und ein wenig beleibt und überhaupt mehr der Angehörige eines Schwimmvereins. (173 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1150 (1953-01-31 - Freiburg)Eine Art Gerichtsverhandlung (Militärgericht) über meine Doktorarbeit. U. scheint der Ankläger gewesen zu sein. Ich werde freigesprochen. Dabei manchmal Häuser innen mit Gängen und Zimmern, manchmal wie im Feldlager. So lasse ich mich an einem Drahtseil, das wohl zu einer Schwebebahn gehört (obwohl es ganz steil hinabgleitet) über einen Sandabhang über eine Grube hinab, in der viele Soldaten lagern. (59 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1151 (1953-01-31 - Freiburg)Zunächst vom Szilasi-Seminar. Ich hatte mich verspätet. War mir auch des Termins nicht ganz sicher. Auf der Treppe begegnete mir eine bärtige fremdländische Schar. Das Seminar schien aber mit den eigentlichen Angehörigen doch stattzufinden, denn ich hörte Stimmen aus dem Zimmer, besonders die von Frau Szilasi. Andere Szene: Bei Gogarten. Er hatte eine eigene kleine Druckerei in seinem Haus, in der er seine Schriften zum Teil selbst druckte. Andere Szene: In einem Auto Fahrt durch eine gefährliche Gegend. Am Steuer Gogarten oder eine ähnliche Gestalt, auch Züge des Roggowers. Ich musste ein Kind hüten, das wohl zu ihm gehörte. Einen Polizisten oder Wachmann nahmen wir unterwegs zu unserem Schutze mit. Andere Szene: In einem Haus, immer noch in jener patriarchalischen Atmosphäre, ich laufe barfuss, zunächst in einem holzparketierten Zimmer, dann in der Küche auf den Fliessen, die angenehm kühl sind unter den Füssen. Es ist Hochsommer. Ich erwache mit dem angenehmen Gefühl des Barfusslaufens wie nach einem warmen Bade. (159 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1152 (1953-02-01 - Freiburg)Heidegger hält ein Seminar, in dem er mit Lebhaftigkeit vorträgt und zuweilen englische Worte in den Vortrag mischt (so wie sonst griechische), ja manchmal ganze englische Sätze spricht -- wohl, weil Engländer im Raum sind. Dann wandelt sich (ohne dass ich es im Traum bemerke) die Figur in eine Tochter Heideggers (in Wirklichkeit gibt es keine). Die Szene bleibt die gleiche. Ich schaue dem Mädchen, die ebenfalls sehr lebhaft vorträgt -- sie hat dieselben Augen wie vorher der Vater -- fest in die Augen. Sie erwidert den Blick, unterbricht aber plötzlich ihren Vortrag und sagt, ich solle den Menschen nicht so in die Augen schauen. Viele Frauen seien darüber indigniert. Ich sage: "Warum denn?" Sie: "Ich weiss nicht -- vielleicht weil sie Babies in sich tragen ..." - Sie macht meinen Blick nach, indem sie so sehr die Augen weitet, dass die Pupillen wie in einem Meer von Weiss schwimmen. Ich sage: "Aber so ist's nicht!" und Marahrens, der neben mir sitzt, bestätigt: "Nein, so macht er's nicht." (168 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1154 (1953-02-02 - Freiburg)Onkel Hans Armin (der als Divisionkommandeur in Stalingrad gefangen wurde) wäre aus Russland zurückgekommen. Seine Gestalt war im Traum zugleich mit der von Specht verdichtet (zwischen beiden besteht auch in der Tat eine Ähnlichkeit an Feinheit, im Stil einer gewissen Noblesse). Die Gestalt seiner Frau Frieda (die eine Urenkelin Hegels ist) war zugleich mit der Gestalt von Spechts Mutter verdichtet, das heisst eigentlich changierten beide Gestalten im Szenenwechsel. Die eine Szene, an die ich mich erinnere, war ein Gespräch mit Spechts Mutter, das ihn, aber wohl in der Rolle von Onkel Hans, betraf, - die andere spielte bei Tische, kurz nach seiner (Hans') Heimkehr. (Er ist in Wahrheit noch immer von den Russen gefangen gehalten und zu dreissig Jahren Zwangsarbeit verurteilt). -- Ich schaute ihn an und sagte: "Bist Du wirklich lebendig oder bist Du tot?" Er schien die Frage nicht beantworten zu können und ich bat ihn, den Kopf im Profil zu zeigen, da könne man sicher einen Lebendigen von einem Toten unterscheiden. Er tat es, und ich stellt mit überzeugende Sicherheit fest, dass er lebendig sei. -- Eine dritte Szene: In einer Vorhalle einer Universität. Ich lasse mich beim Rektor melden, indem ich der Sekretärin die Bitte sage, "Magnifizenz zu sprechen". Es handelte sich um ein Bild aus dem Besitz von Onkel Hans und Tante Frieda, eine Handzeichnung Goethes, das auf eine Ausstellung verschickt werden sollte. Hans hatte aber rückkehrend sofort geäussert, dass das Bild gar nicht fixiert und darum für eine Ausstellung viel zu empfindlich sei. Ich musste nun die Rückgabe vom Rektor erwirken. Irgendwann im Traum wurde auch -- wohl durch Hans selber -- von einem Folterungsgerät berichtet, mit dem man beide Hände abschneidet und zwar sehr langsam und so, dass das Messer zuerst in die eine Hand und erst später in die andere einschneidet, weil es nicht ganz waagerecht aufgehängt ist. Es handelt sich um eine Art Guillotine für die Hände. Der Verurteilte wird dann zuletzt elektrisch getötet oder verblutet. (325 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1155 (1953-02-04 - Freiburg)Vielfältiges Gewebe von Traumszenen, aus dem ich nur Bruchstücke behalten habe: In der Nervenklinik: Eine Patientin spricht von Antje als der "schwarzen, talentierten Ärztin". Andere Szene: Die kleine Jund (Malerin aus der Kunstakademie) war verlobt und sollte heiraten. Sie hatte einen weichen, faszinierenden Blick, nicht den scharfen, kritischen, der ihr sonst eigen ist. Der Funke sprang zwischen uns über und wir küssten uns leidenschaftlich. Andere Szene, in der es darum ging, über eine schwankende Leiter in ein Haus einzusteigen. Unten war ein Hund, der den direkten Eintritt verwehrte. Das Haus war gebaut, dass die massiven Steinteile, in denen sich eine Wirtschaft befand, kellerartig in die Erde eingelassen waren. Oben war nur ein leichtes Holzwerk, über einer Feldscheune. Doch schien dort auch der "Käfig" zu sein, oder ein ähnlicher Raum. Andere Szene: In meinem kleinen Silberschälchen, in das ich die Wachsbabies, die Emme gemacht hat, gelegt habe, finde ich noch eine ganze Reihe solcher Babies, aber schmal wie eine Strichmenschenart, und schliesse, dass Emme diese bei ihrem letzten Besuch auch noch gemacht haben muss. - Andere Szene: Ich war auf Wanderschaft und fand mich schliesslich nach Holland geraten, wo ich erfuhr, dass ich in unmittelbarer Nähe des grossen Überschwemmungsgebietes sei und gewarnt wurde, meinen Weg dorthin fortzusetzen, da neue Überschwemmung droht. Ich aber ging erst recht schnurstracks in diese Richtung. Die Szene wechselte dann. (223 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1157 (1953-02-09 - Freiburg)Traum von gestern Nacht: Ich erinnere nur noch eine Frau, die ein Baby in einen tiefen Schacht fallen lässt. Es handelte sich in dem Traum um Gänge durch zwei rechtwinklig zueinander liegende Strassenzüge: Talstrasse (in der ich wohne) und Güntersthalstrasse, die in das benachbarte Güntersthal führt. In dieser nun war die Strasse irgendwie aufgerissen -- schachtartig, und wir gingen über Gerüste und schmale Planken wie auf einem Bau. In einer jener Schächte stürzte das Baby hinab. Wir sollten jenseits der Baustelle Leute, offenbar nahe Verwandte des Babys erreichen. (88 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1158 (1953-02-18 - Freiburg)Traum heute Nacht: Beim Absteigen vom Fahrrad haben sich die Beine verstrickt (es ist ein Damenfahrrad, bei dem man, ohne ein Bein über eine Stange schwingen zu müssen, direkt absteigen kann, wobei das ja zuerst absteigende Bein, an dem noch im Pedal stehenden vorbeigekreuzt werden muss. Hierbei im Traum die Schwierigkeit). Ich musste das Bein erst hoch und zurückziehen, um richtig auf den Boden zu kommen. Erwachen: Die Beine waren im Liegen auf der Seite über einander gekreuzt, so dass das obere auf das untere drückte. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1159 (1953-02-18 - Freiburg)Vor mehreren Tagen (bei gemeinsamen Schlaf mit Emme): In einer Flugplatzumgebung. Ich kletterte zunächst mit einem Piloten an einer Hausfassade herum (es war wohl ein Holländer). Der Pilot springt mit mehreren anderen auf der Höhe des oberen Stockwerks auf die Strasse hinab. Des Springens ungewohnt sehe ich, dass ich nicht heil unten ankommen würde, und lasse mich darum lieber zunächst auf einen dachartigen Fassadenvorsprung über der Haustür und von da auf die Strasse herab. Dann gemeinsamer Gang nach links die Strasse hinab in Richtung auf den Flugplatz, auf den sie bei einem pavillonartigen Bau mündet, der offenbar als Kasino dient. Ich entsinne mich (im Traum) eines Ausspruches Nicolai Hartmanns, dass man dort zu sehr unregelmässigen Zeiten das Essen gereicht bekomme (offenbar verursacht durch die verschiedenen Landezeiten der Flugzeuge). Der Ort scheint zugleich auch eine Art Kurort zu sein, hat etwas Luxoriöses und zugleich Leeres. Hartmann war wohl dort zur Kur. Übrigens sah ich das holländische Flugzeug in einer der beschriebenen vorangegangenen Szenen schon landen und langsam in Richtung auf das Gebäude heranrollen. Dann entstiegen ihm viele Passagiere. Szenenwechsel: In einer Hafenstadt (wohl Hamburg) bin ich auf einem Boot auf dem Wasser. Man sieht ein Flugzeug am Himmel im Absturz (wenn ich nicht irre, mit einer Rauchfahne) wieder niedergehen. Gleichzeitig eine Polizeistreife (wohl Hafenpolizei) im Boot, den Vorgang bemerken und ein Kalkül darüber beginnen, wo das Flugzeug niedergegangen sein muss. Ich fahre mit meinem Boot sofort dort hin, wo es in die Gewässer gestürzt sein muss. Es ist im Winkel eines Hafenbeckens zwischen einer Mauer und einer aus dem Wasser aufragenden Hausfassade, die das Becken an dieser Ecke abschliessen. Ich rufe: "Hallo", um auf etwaige Überlebende im Wasser aufmerksam zu werden. Eine weibliche Kinderstimme antwortet mit: "Ja". Ich frage: "Wo bist Du?" und höre jetzt: "Hier" aus einem Fenster über mir in der Mauer des Hauses. Offenbar hat ein Kind dort meinen Ruf gehört und beantwortet. Ich rufe zurück: "Es ist gut, Du kannst da bleiben", um zu verhindern, dass das Kind das Fenster öffnet und ins und ins Wasser herabfällt. (340 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1163 (1953-02-25 - Freiburg)Traum aus russischer Gefangenschaft. Schon im Lager hatte ich Heimweh. Ich war in allen Verichtungen etwas langsamer als die anderen, doch die Aufseher ertrugen es einigermassen geduldig. Ein intelligenter Russe gab mir, als ich zu spät kam, den Auftrag, kleine Theater aus Pappkartons zu machen, beziehungsweise die schon begonnenen zu Ende zu machen, nach Art der Puppenküchen oder Kaufmannsläden, die eine Wand und das Dach offen haben. Die Theater hatten Namen, eins war glaube ich das Gänsetheater das andere, das schon angefangen war, hiess Aristoteles-Theater. Später war ich aus dem Lager ausgebrochen, und schlenderte in einer östlichen Stadt umher. Irgendwo war eine Beerdigung, um die herum der Verkehr aufgehalten war. Die Stadt war in Strassenzüge und Häuseranlage locker gefügt -- in östlicher Weise. Auf einer Strasse traf ich einen mongolisch aussehenden Mann, etwas grösser als ich, dem ich mich anvertraute. Er sagte, er sei Este, und verlangt von mir einige Zeichnungen, die ich bei mir trug, sozusagen als Tribut. Ich gab sie, doch bat ich eine, die mein Profil darstellte, zurück. Der Mann machte einige Notizen, wobei er nach östlicher Art die Worte übereinander schrieb, so dass seine Hand im Schreiben nicht wie die unsere ununterbrochen nach rechts ausrückte, sondern nach vorne vom Körper weg. Dies gab eine Gebärde der Herrschaft in seinem Schreiben. Er meinte, dass sei die ursprüngliche Schreibweise der Esten (mir fiel dabei ein, dass sie zur finno-ugrischen Sprachfamilie gehören und also asiatische Herkunft haben). Man könne die Worte auch nebeneinander schreiben, doch blieben sie dann unbetont. Jedes Wort selbst setzte er in einen meist elliptischen oder kreisartigen Zug ohne Unterbrechung hin. So entstand ein von unten beginnendes Schriftbild. Die Übereinanderordnung ergab zugleich eine Betonung, die mir während des Schreibvorgangs mit der jeweils stärker ausgreifenden Hand einleuchtete. Schliesslich am Ende des Traums sann ich über die Möglichkeiten der Flucht nach und, da ich gerade Leichenwagen auf der Strasse an mir vorbeifahren sah, überlegte ich, ob ich nicht in einem Sarg unkontrolliert mich transportieren lassen könne. Sogar an die Möglichkeit, zu zweit in dem Sarg zu sein, dachte ich. (341 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1164 (1953-02-26 - Freiburg)Sah im Traum einen "Krach-Brief" vom Emme. Sie hatte ihn mit der Schreibmaschine so geschrieben, dass zwischen einzelnen Sätzen und Satzfeldern grosse Abstände waren, die sie noch mit erläuternden Bemerkungen ausfüllen konnte. Dann hatte sie ihn sogar in einzelne Abteilungen entsprechend diesen Abschnitten zerschnitten, so dass auf jedem der Papierstreifen ein kurzer gedruckter Kern, oft nur Satzfetzen, inmitten eines grossen weissen Raumes stand, den man dann mit Bemerkungen ausfüllen konnte, so methodisch vorgehend, wie bei einer Dissertation, der man durch Schneiden und Ergänzen allmählich Fülle gibt.

Erst im Erwachen wurde mir klar, dass beide ein und dieselbe Person sind. Ich gab ihm während des Traums gerührt einen Kuss, weil ich nicht wusste, ob ich ihn wegen seiner Krankheit noch einmal wiedersehen würde. (74 words)

Dies schien mir aber utopisch, da das Schiff bereits mitten auf dem breiten Strom schwamm. (66 words)

Doch dieser war geflohen, wie mir sein Sohn, der seinen Vater als Bürgermeister bezeichnete, mitteilte. (59 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1170 (1953-03-08 - Wolfhagen)Zunächst Verkehrsprobleme. Eine Strassenbahn fuhr von hinten in eine Auto rein, das auf den Schienen gehalten hatte, wo der Fahrer einfach eingeschlafen war. Sie schob das Auto dabei langsam weiter, bis es schliesslich gegen eine Wand aufstiess. Der Fahrer brauchte diese Zeit zum aufwachen. Er schien nicht sichtlich verletzt, nur hatte er wohl einige Glassplitter bei dem letzten Aufprall ins Gesicht bekommen. Es erschien dann sofort ein Mann vor dem Wagen, den man sozusagen durch den Wagen durch von innen vor der Scheibe sah, etwa wie bei den Aufnahmen im Orphée, die die Flucht ins Totenreich zeigen, bei denen man durch den Wagen die Landschaft "en négatif" sieht. Der Mann, der vor dem Wagen erschienen ist, entfernt vorsichtig den Rest der durchlöcherten Vorderscheibe des Wagens aus dem Rahmen, damit der Insasse, der immer noch mit der Müdigkeit kämpft, dort einen Ausstieg habe, und gibt dem noch erwachenden Fahrer ein Zeichen. Mich frappierte während des Traums die Brutalität, mit der die Strassenbahn den Wagen einfach fort und gegen eine Wand schob, nur weil der Fahrer gerade auf ihren Schienen eingeschlafen war.

Dort lag ein nicht besonders grosses schnittiges Schiff, das aber ein kleines Bordflugzeug hatte, das einer grossen auf dem ubootartigen weissen Rumpf gelandeten Möwe glich.

Störring wiedertreffe, bei dem ich in Göttingen Medizinische Psychologie hörte. Er begrüsst mich erfreut, wie es seine Art ist und fordert mich auf, "morgen, am Neujahrstag, seine Vorlesung zu hören", die er "die Neujahrsvorlesung" nennt.

Ich machte mich also auf den Weg, suchte aber zuvor noch meine Sandalen, von denen mir seit einiger Zeit die zweite gefehlt hatte, und ass einige Stückchen Schokolade, die ich in der Tasche hatte. Andere Szene: Gang mit der Emme am Pfaffenteich (Schwerin) in Richtung auf das Gymnasium. Es ist Hochsommer. Ein Teil des Pfaffenteichs ist ausgetrocknet.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1183 (1953-03-23 - Wittmoldt)In München in Allis Wohnung. Dort habe ich ein schmales Zimmer entdeckt, das nur als Abstellkammer dient. Frage Emmi, ob sie es nicht vermieten wolle. Sie hat Einwände: Man müsse durch die Küche gehen. Ich sehe, dass das Zimmer auch eine Tür zum Kinderzimmer hat. Es hat Fenster nach zwei Seiten und Oberlicht. Beim Schliessen eines Fensters fallen mir Glassplitter entgegen. Es ist kaputt. (64 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1184 (1953-03-24 - Wittmoldt)Besuch bei Gisela. Sie zog sich nackt aus vor mir, um sich umzukleiden. Ich sah, dass sie durch die Geburt nur noch schöner geworden war. Vorher Traumszene von einem Aufenthalt in England. Ich hatte herrlich viele neue Sachen: Lederhosen in verschiedenen Farben, bunte wollige Pullover und Anderes. Dann eine Szene am Ufer des Pfaffenteichs in Schwerin, doch gegenüberliegend dem Ufer der Schule, dort, wo meine Eltern noch vor meiner Geburt gewohnt hatten. Da stand eine Art Zigeunerwagen, konstruiert wie ein Leiterwagen, mit Decken verhängt. Wenn man sie aufhob, sah man in Fächern viele Babies liegen. Eine Frau führte das vor, es war aber nicht die Mutter, sondern eine Amme. Die Babies gehörten offenbar einer Jüdin. (115 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1185 (1953-03-26 - Wittmoldt)"Fritz-Lehmann-Strasse 30" und "Pöhlmannstrasse 18", waren zwei Adressen, die in einem Traum vorkamen, dessen Inhalt ich vergessen habe. (18 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1186 (1953-03-26 - Wittmoldt)Besuch in einem Haus, in dem Züge aus Volksdorf, Freiburg und Schwerin und aus den Erzählungen von Mix über ein Schloss verdichtet waren. Ich war auf einer Anhalterreise, die mich wieder nach Wittmoldt führen sollte. (Offenbar war ich für kurze Zeit von hier in Richtung Süden fortgefahren) zu Besuch in einem schlossartigen Haus. Ganz oben unter dem Dach wohnte Ika (wie in Volksdorf, nur war das Traumhaus höher und hatte das kleine Fenster der Dachkammer ein wenig unter dem überhängenden Dach versteckt wie bei meinem Käfig in Freiburg und dicht über anderen Fenstern, so dass man die Etagen schlecht unterscheiden könnte. Das Ganze war schlossartig vieletagig aufgestockt, so dass der Käfig, beziehungsweise Ikas ihm so ähnliche Volksdorfer Kammer, mit dem kleinen Fensterchen in der Fassade fast verloren ging. So schon in vergangenen Freiburger Träumen, nur damals noch ohne die Beziehung auf Ikas Kammer in Volksdorf. Ich schaute da hinauf, um zu sehen, ob Ika hinausschauen würde, es öffnete sich ein Fenster, und eine junge Frauengestalt lud mich zum Kaffee ein -- es war aber wohl ein Fenster noch unterhalb der Kammer. Die Frau musste mich hinausschauend gesehen haben. Ich hatte sehr verloren und vertieft hinaufgeblickt, weil ich ein merkwürdiges Phänomen gewahrte: Eine Tür, irgendwo unter dem Giebel in der Fassade, die aber ins Nichts führte. Kein Balkon war da -- dagegen perspektivisch über der Tür etwas gemalt, was einen Balkon vorspiegelte, doch so, dass man diese Täuschung nur vollziehen konnte, wenn man das Ganze über Kopf sah (weil ja der Balkon oberhalb der Tür gemalt war). Dies stellte sich aber ganz von selbst ein, weil man wegen der Höhe des Hauses, den Kopf hinaufschauend so weit zurücklegen musste. Dort oben irgendwo also öffnete sich das Fenster und ich ging hinauf zum Kaffee. Es war eine der Töchter, die mich gerufen hatte. Ihrer Familie gehörte das Schloss. Die Frau war jung und sehr schön. Sie trug einen flauschigen grau-violetten Pullover, unter dem sich die Linie der Brüste in einer schönen Plastik abbildeten. Wir umarmten uns und küssten uns. Neben der Stube der jungen Frau wohnte ein alter, etwas verwirrter Greis. Dies war offenbar das Zimmer mit der merkwürdigen Balkontür. Nach der anderen Seite hin schloss offenbar die Wohnung einer älteren Schwester an, die mehr die Honoratiorin des Hauses war. Schliesslich kam noch eine dritte, Jüngste, die ich zunächst mit der anderen, der jungen Frau, verwechselte, weil sie sich ein wenig ähnlich waren, und wir im Rausch uns nicht objektivierend betrachten, doch erkannte ich sie an der anderen Art des Blickes, der bei der Jüngeren kühl, abwartend und plänkelnd zugleich war, doch ohne die Kraft der Berauschenden. Aus Schwerin kam noch ein Zug in den Traum hinein: Wir schauten beim Kaffee hinaus auf den tiefblauen See, der jedoch direkt unter dem Schloss lag (wie hier in Wittmoldt übrigens). Er war stark bewegt, zum Teil mit Schaumkronen. Das Blau war so tief wie auf dem Bild des Meeres bei Le Havre von Raul Duffy. Ich hatte vor, über Braunschweig nach Wittmoldt zu fahren. Doch gab ich Braunschweig auf. (505 words)

Die Hausherren, heimkommend, wussten noch nichts davon. Jeder von den vielen versammelten Leuten drückte sich, es ihnen zu sagen. Ich wollte es tun. Dann Szenenwechsel: Vor dem Haus wird eine winzige Bahre für das kleine Kind aufgestellt mit Tannenzweigen und unendlichen Kränzen. Eine alte Dame ruft ausser sich: "Wozu all die Verzierungen!" Ich versuche, sie zu beruhigen. Orgelmusik ertönt. Ich erwache und höre noch im Erwachen das Anspringen der elektrischen Wasserpumpe, die zusammen mit einem anderen Elektromotor ein vielstimmiges orgelartiges Geräusch ergab. (96 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1189 (1953-03-28 - Wittmoldt)Vorher anderer Traum: Ein Faschingsfest: Ich sehe viele leichtbekleidete Mädchen, die tanzen, dann ein Kostüm, das nur aus hauchdünnen glutvoll leuchtenden Chiffontüchern besteht. Darunter ein sehr brauner Körper. Ich erkenne an der Hand, am Körperbau und am Kostüm, dass ich ja zum Fasching gemacht habe, Emme. Sie schlägt grossen dunkle Augen auf, die leidenschaftlich schauen. Die Augen sind dunkler als sonst, doch meine ich darin eine tiefere Schicht zu erkennen. (70 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1190 (1953-03-28 - Wittmoldt)Vorher anderer Traum: Als Oberprimaner nach einer Krankheit auf dem Weg in die Schule: Auf dem Schulhof sind alle Klassen in kriegerischer Bemalung angetreten, wie zu einem Manöver. Ich finde meine Klasse nicht und trete schliesslich als einziger Zivilist in das Haus ein: Schleichende, mit aufgepflanzten Bajonetten, tasten sich langsam neben mir herein, während ich unberührt vom Kriegsspiel durch die Gänge schreite. Es ist merkwürdig, so das Haus gleichsam in zwei Schichten zu sehen. (74 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1191 (1953-03-29 - Wittmoldt)Besuch bei Gisela. Ich ging mit ihr ins Bett und Peter mit Emme. Dir Art, wie sie sich über mich beugte und meine anfängliche Hemmung überwand, war beglückend. Im Erwachen spürte ich dieses Sich-über.mich-Legende in dem Veilchenduft, der Blumen, die neben meinem Bette standen, und der im Schlaf wie eine Freundin sich über mich gelegt hatte. Doch empfand ich im Erwachen noch diese Einheit des beglückenden Erlebnisses des Traums mit dem Duft der Blumen. Es war nicht ein nachträgliches Verknüpfen, sondern ein einfaches Wiedererkennen des Selben. Dieser Duft und Giselas Nähe in dem Traum waren das Selbe. Man kann diese Selbigkeit im Wachen nicht vorstellen, weil sie völlige Einheit ist. In einer anderen Szene kam der Verwalter des Schlosses herein, und wunderte sich, dass von den drei Besuchern, wie er sich ausdrückte, einer fehle. Gisela hatte bei seinem Eintritt die Decke über mich gezogen und rollt mir, während er sprach, behutsam den Rest der Decke über den Schopf aus. Er vermutete jedoch das Richtige, tastete auf die Decke und spürte, dass ich darunter war, meinte aber, diese eine Nacht solle es ihn nicht stören. (184 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1192 (1953-03-30 - Wittmoldt)Das Emme heisst Angelika. Ich stehe auf dem Berg, der mit einem Abhang über der Strasse hängt, ein Berg der Vogesen, und schaue in der Ferne silberklar und deutlich über den Schwarzwald und über das Tal hinweg bis an die südlichen Vogesen reichend, in deren Norden ich stehe, die Kette der Alpen. Weit rechts sehe ich das Matterhorn. Ich will mich vorbeugen, um noch mehr zu sehen, dort wo die Alpen von den südlichen Vogesen nur wie von einer Strassenfront, aus deren Fenster ich sehe, gleichsam versperrt werden. Doch bin ich dabei so an den Abhang und auf ihn gekommen, dass ich nicht aus eigener Kraft mich zurückziehen kann. Ich rufe Emme, die unten auf der Strasse ist und Angelika heisst, herauf. Die Dimension der Berge und auch der Breite der Rheintals ist irgendwie traumhaft der einer breiten Strasse- und Häuserhöhe angemessen, so dass Emme ohne Mühe schnell bei mir oben auf dem Berg sein kann. Emme (Angelika) hilft mir zurück und wir steigen den Berg hinab. (167 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1193 (1953-04-01 - Wittmoldt)Erste Szene spielt bei meiner Schwester. Sie hat Ringelstrümpfe. Diese ziehe ich an. Sie stehen etwas steif wie gestärkt um den Fuss. Dieser kommt dabei in eine tänzerische Haltung mit gestreckten Zehen und Fussspitzen nach unten (wie bei Spitzentanz). Zweite Szene: Die Szene wechselt so, dass ich bei Gisela bin. Sie wohnt mit Peter in einem Teil des Hauses oder Schlosses, ich in einem angrenzenden, wohl mit meinem Bruder -- oder war es jemand anders? Dieser will die Zeitung haben. Sie ist aber nicht da, weil Peter sie nicht rechtzeitig zurückgelegt hat. Zwischen unseren Wohnungen ist eine Waschküche. Dort müssen wir durchgehen. Ich erkläre diese wohl unbewusste Verzögerung aus einer verkappten Eifersucht bei ihm. Wir gehen herüber. Andere Szene: (Aus der vorigen Szene ist nur die Räumlichkeit ähnlich geblieben: Zwei Flügel eines Hauses, die jetzt rechtwinklig aneinanderstoßen. Ich wohne da mit meinem Bruder. Wir kommen aus dem einen Flügel (entsprechend Peters Wohnung in der vorigen Szene) zurück und sehen, dass jemand im Haus, in unserer Wohnung (im anderen Flügel) war. Mein Bruder geht rein. Ich sehe gerade noch aus dem Garten ein altmodisches eckiges Auto fortfahren, erkenne, dass es Einbrecher waren. Kann sie nicht mehr anhalten. Dann kommt ein Mann aus der Tür. Ich weiss, der hat meinen Bruder geknebelt. Ich rufe ihm: "Halt" zu. Er sagt, er habe es eilig. Er gehöre zu den Leuten, die in dem Auto gerade fortfuhren. Ich sage, "das passt ja gut" und überlege, wie ich den Mann niederschlagen soll. (246 words)

Man springt in die Luft und stösst dabei zugleich mit dem Oberkörper nach vorne und mit dem Kopf zur linken Seite. So kann man sich eine ganze Weile in der Luft halten. Ich gehe dann früher von diesen Übungen fort, weil ich mich für meinen Flugdienst frisch halten muss. Der Weg von dem H.J.-Platz fort führt durch das Gebäude einer Post oder Eisenbahndirektion oder irgendwie um diese herum.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1199 (1953-04-10 - Wittmoldt)Ich wohnte in einem, halb in die Erde versenkten Bunker, der Bekannten gehörte und den ich mir sehr schön eingerichtet hatte. So waren viele Bilder und anderes an den beworfenen Wänden, so dass die Ölflecken, die von früher her durch die Wand durchbrachen, kaum mehr zu sehen waren. In einem länglichen Nebenraum des quadratischen Bunkers waren Tiere untergebracht, die dem Besitzer gehörten, Schlangen und andere merkwürdige und schöne Tiere. Ich konnte sie durch ein Gitter sehen und hatte zuweilen Angst, sie würden hindurchkriechen, doch liebte ich sie sehr. Jedoch sorgte ich dafür, dass die Tür zu ihrem Raum, die ebenfalls, wie die meine, nach aussen ins Freie führte, geschlossen war, wenn ich den Bunker über einige in die Tiefe hinabführende Steinstufen betrat. Der Bunker lag in einem kleinen, kesselartigen Tal von nur etwa hundert Metern Durchmesser, in das man nur von einer Seite aus hineingelangte. Die Lage war einsam, und ich fürchtete darum Einwendungen der Polizei gegen diese Wohnart. Doch dachte ich mir, dass man in der öffentlichen Meinung ein solches Tal für wohnbar halten würde, wenn nur recht viele Plakate und Reklamen dort aufgestellt seien, die die Gegend sozusagen zu einem Terrain der Grossstadt machen würden. So, dachte ich mir ironisch, würde die Öffentlichkeit befriedigt sein. Und so war es auch: Nächste Szene: Ich betrat das Tal von seinem Eingang aus und sah Polizisten oder Beamte mit aufgeschlagenen Mänteln vor meinem Bunker stehen. Die Gegend war nicht unbelebt. Menschen gingen dort hin und her auf Wegen, die so geebnet waren, wie in den Ruinenfeldern der Grossstädte, die man oberflächlich wieder zivilisiert hat. Kleine Reklamestände waren aufgestellt und gaben dem Terrain einen grossstädtischen Anstrich. Ich ging langsam in das Tal hinein und hielt mich zunächst abseits, um einer Befragung der Polizisten auszuweichen. Doch hörte ich bald meinen Namen Uslar rufen und merkte, dass die Leute mich suchten. Die Beamten waren loyal, sie waren nicht gekommen, um zu monieren, sondern, um zu planen, nämlich einen Hausbau, der auch das Gelände meines Bunkers berührte. So sah ich mich gezwungen auszuziehen. Ich machte mich (Szenenwechsel) mit mehreren, die zu mir gehörten, auf die Reise in einem schiffartigen Fahrzeug. Wir fuhren auf einem Strom, der zugleich wie eine Strasse war, das Schiff zugleich wie ein Pferdefuhrwerk. Es war beladen wie auf einem Treck, und wir hockten auch darauf. Zunächst waren wir auf einem kleineren Fluss, der Lage etwa nach könnte es der Neckar gewesen sein, und auf jedem Fall fuhren wir wohl in nordwestlicher Richtung. -- Dann planten wir den Übergang auf einen grossen breiten Strom, obwohl dieser eigentlich durch externes Terrain führte. So war es ein Risiko, doch wir gelangten unangefochten auf diese verkehrsreiche Wasserstrasse. Es war die Donau. Doch floss sie dort, wo eigentlich der Rhein fliesst. Beide waren gewissermassen eins. Auch meine ich, den Namen Ister gehört zu haben. Es war ein grosser Grenzfluss, zumal Grenzstrasse. Sehr verkehrsreich. So stand mitten auf einer Kreuzung ein Polizist, der den Verkehr lenkte. Wir sahen uns durch seine Verkehrslenkung genötigt, in eine Seitenstrasse einzubiegen. Hier war unser Fahrzeug ganz zum Pferdefahrzeug geworden und auch die Strasse zur Landverkehrsstrasse -- und hier in der Seitenstrasse, die ganz in fremdem Terrain lag, zu warten, bis die grosse Strasse wieder für uns frei wurde. Ein zweiter Polizist stand hier und wachte streng darüber, dass kein Fahrzeug über die Stoplinien führe. Unser Pferde zogen immer wieder plötzlich an und mussten mühevoll zum Rückwärtsgehen gezwungen werden. Ich fürchtete jeden Moment den Eingriff des Polizisten, bei dem vielleicht herauskommen könnte, dass wir keine Papiere für dieses Land hätten. So kam es auch. Der Polizist in einem altmodischen Helm, wie er in vielen Ländern bei der Polizei üblich ist (das fremde Land, auf dessen Terrain wir uns befanden, war übrigens Belgien), trat herzu und forderte mit drakonischen Massnahmen, indem er meine Hände in kneifende, zum Foltern bestimmte Klammern legte, meine Papiere. Ich war so empört über diesen Eingriff in meine Freiheit, dass ich, obwohl ich ja gar keine Papiere hatte und insofern er auf diesem Terrain mir gegenüber im Recht war, erwiderte: "Nicht, ehe die Klammern gelöst sind!" Er antwortete mit gefletschten Zähnen, die aus einem knöchernen Gesicht mit starren Augen, das vertrocknet wirkte, unsympathisch hervorstachen und Lücken aufwiesen: "Dann kommen die Klammern ins Gesicht." Es war eine ausgesprochene Foltermethode, die er anwandte. Doch gedachte ich, nicht nachzugeben, und hielt noch auf die Hauptstrasse Ausschau, auf die ich wieder zu gelangen hoffte. Doch sah ich gerade, wie der verkehrslenkende Polizist, der die Strasse für uns noch immer nicht wieder frei gegeben hatte, auf einmal seinen Platz auf der Strasse verliess und fortging. So war hier zunächst alle Aussicht geschwunden. Der Zugang war gesperrt wie an einer Zonengrenze, die mitten durch ein verkehrsreiches Gelände führt und von den Machthabern ohne Angabe der Gründe geöffnet und geschlossen wird. Erwachen. -- Zwischen diese Szene war, wohl an der Stelle der Abreisevorbereitung, noch eine andere eingestreut, in der ich in einem Haus mit mehreren Räumen, das aber im übrigen, wenn auch leichter gebaut, - meinen Bunker glich und in dem ich mit Freundinnen und Freunden zusammen wohnte, einen Freund traf, der mir seine Abenteuer erzählte, wobei es sich um eine Art polygames Verhältnis handelte. Ich erwiderte ihm, ich fände dies -- was er erzählte -- zuviel auf einmal -- so sehr ich sonst dafür sei. Das Mädchen, das dabei sass, eine sehr sympathische und in ihrer Art lockere und gepflegte Frau, lächelte bei diesen Worten. (900 words)

Mir fällt Löwith's Kritik in der neueren Zeit ein. Ich erzähle meinem Vater die Geschichte. Mein Vater liest mir später -- es ist im Wohnzimmer im Elternhaus Abends spät, die anderen schlafen schon - einen Brief Rilkes vor, an Vater gerichtet, über ihn und mich. Rilke schildert seine Väterlichkeit, die meinen Kinderwünschen nachgeht, so will ich in den Ziegenstall, wo Süssigkeiten sind, um dann diese zu geniessen. -- Mein Vater gibt mir den Brief dann zum Lesen. Ich lese ihn dann laut vor. Wir streichen eine Stelle über das transzendentale Dasein an, die er sofort als Schlüsselstelle erkennt. -- Dann Gespräch. Er meint, die Indo-germannen seien die Frühesten, die Gott als Selbstbewusstsein gedacht haben. Ich erwidere: "Nein, die Juden". (138 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1203 (1953-04-18 - Wittmoldt)Ich kam in die Ostzone nach Roggow und vermutete Maria Reichhardt dort. Zu meiner Verwunderung fand ich das Schloss aber nicht mehr von Flüchtlingen bewohnt (wie es seit 1945 war), sondern man schien dort eine Art Nervensanatorium untergebracht zu haben. So hörte ich, auf der Diele stehend, einen Arbeiter draussen rufen: "Soll ich die Lux-Lampe ausschalten, damit sie die Patienten nicht blendet?" -- Da ich niemanden im Hause kannte und mich als Grenzgänger nicht verraten durfte, beschloss ich vorsichtig, die Namensschilder zu entziffern, wie ich sie zum Beispiel an der linken Dielentür, die in eine Stube führt, entdeckte. (In Roggow führte diese Tür in die sogenannte "französische Stube", die mit Wandbildern von Rubens geschmückt war. Man hatte mir einmal erzählt, dass Flüchtlinge oder Militär Nägel durch diese Tapetenbilder geschlagen hätten, um Wäscheleinen daran zu befestigen). Hier im Traum aber war es zugleich die Topographie des hiesigen Wittmoldter Hauses, in der jene Dielentür in die grosse Stube führt, in der die Balten wohnen. Ich fand jedoch nur fremde Namen dort. Darum frage ich vorsichtig ein Dienstmädchen, das vorbeiging, ob sie wisse, ob Maria Reichhardt noch hier sei. Der Name kam ihr bekannt vor, doch wusste sie nicht viel mehr. Die Patienten schienen oft zu wechseln. So ging ich durch die Haustür hinaus, um draussen weiter zu fragen. Hier begegnete mir eine Art Pflegerin, die mehr zu wissen schien. Sie erzählte, Maria Reichhardt habe hier im Büro gearbeitet, vor dessen Fenstern wir gerade standen (die selbe Lage wie die des Wittmoldter Büros, und in Roggow waren jene Zimmer Salon). Sie wäre jedoch der Arbeit nicht gewachsen gewesen. Ein Nervenarzt hätte vorgeschlagen gehabt, sie im Büro eines Sanatoriums arbeiten zu lassen. Ich sagte: "Ein merkwürdiger Vorschlag für einen so veranlagten Menschen". - "Ja", sagte sie spontan, gewissermassen sich verredend, "darum ging es auch nicht, und wir haben sie auf die Sperrabteilung gebracht". - "So ist sie also doch noch hier", sagte ich und erwachte. Ich überlegte dann im Halbwachen noch lange, wie ich in die Sperrabteilung eindringen, eventuell mit dem Arzt sprechen und ihr helfen, oder, wenn nötig, sie befreien könne, denn es schien mir eine Gefahr der Vergasung zu bestehen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1213 (1953-04-29 - Wittmoldt)Cello-Spiel durch den Leiter der Cello-Klasse an der Freiburger Musikhochschule (Professor Attis Teichmanis). Gleichzeitig -- oder wenigstens sehr bald im Verlauf der Szene -- ist es aber auch der Direktor der Freiburger Psychiatrie, Professor Ruffin, der das Cello spielt. Während des Spiels, der Wiedergabe eines sehr alten vorbarocken Stückes, das eine Kette von aneinander gereihten Figuren bildet, Tänze und Szenen sozusagen, sehe ich diese Szenen, Figuren und Bewegungen sehr deutlich -- aber so, dass dies die Musik ist, - nicht nur eine dabei mit vorgestellte Figur, sondern: Ton und Bild sind im Traum völlig eine Einheit, sind das Selbe. Erst nachträglich, in der wachen Reflexion, kann ich bewusst feststellen, dass das überhaupt etwas Sonderbares ist, wobei ich eine Tonvorstellung mit einer Bildvorstellung verbinde. Nicht so war es im Traum, sondern Ton und Bild waren überhaupt nicht geschieden, waren nicht zwei, sie waren absolut das Selbe. Die Bewegungen waren sehr schön und archaisch- ein wenig wie persische Miniaturen. Sie wurden völlig durch das Cellospiel gebildet. (164 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1220 (1953-05-19 - Freiburg)Im Hause Szilasis Gespräch mit einem Gast über die Gastfreundschaft dieses Hauses und über das reizende Verhältnis des Gastgebers zu ihrer Wirtschafterin, Frau H. Ich sage, dass ich das gut verstehen könne, da die Frau Ostpreussin sei, und dieser Volksstamm vielleicht der beste in Deutschland. Andere Szene: In Wittmoldt, das schlossartig elegant (in diesem Traum) gebaut ist. Angesehener Besuch wird erwartet. Ich esse zuvor noch Pudding (rote Grütze), wobei ich sozusagen, um mir einen Vorrat anzulegen, die Masse löffelweise durch das Fenster hinausschaufele, wo sie sich draussen zu ebener Erde sammelt. Dann erscheint der Besuch, etwas spiessige Leute mit Kindern, und ich soll ihn in die Geschichte Freiburgs einführen, denn Wittmoldt (in Wirklichkeit 1000 km entfernt) liegt in diesem Traum direkt vor den Toren Freiburgs. Ich bin nur schlecht informiert und werde mich so durchschlagen müssen. So werde ich zuerst nach der Geschichte des Reiters Joseph in Freiburg gefragt, wobei ich jedoch die Frage zunächst so verstehe, als handle es sich um die Geschichte von Wittmoldt und in dieser kann ich keine Beziehung mit der Gestalt herstellen, doch weiss ich, dass es sich um einen der Habsburger handelt, die Freiburg beherrscht haben.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1221 (1953-05-22 - Freiburg)Traum von einer Art surrealistischem Zimmertheater: Emme als U-Boot, Dolo als Perpendikel. Die Szene war so: In einem Raum mit Bänken ein Priester und ein Mann mit etwas ungewöhnlichem Schädel, kantig breitem Gesicht. Ein anderer Priester, gemütlich, behutsam und mit Hut, kommt herein, beginnt ein Gespräch mit dem Mann, erfährt seinen Beruf: Komödiant, und hält ihm eine lange Moralpredigt. Indem versichert jener, dass auch er in Begleitung eines Priesters sei. Plötzlich sehe ich aber, wie der hinzugekommene Priester, der eben noch die Predigt hielt, heimlich in einer Ecke seine schwarzen Kleider auszieht, denn er hat in dem Kömidianten seinen Bruder erkannt und ist selbst nur verkleidet. Nun beginnt das eigentliche Theater -- von ganz surrealistischer Art: Der Kömidiant mit seinem runden Gesicht ist hinter einer Messingmaske der Perpendikel einer grossen Uhr, der gleichmässig an der Wand hin und her schwingt. Dolo aber hat die Aufgabe, mit ihrem Gesicht, indem sie die Augen kneift, einen anderen winklig schildförmigen Perpendikel darzustellen, was ihr hervorragend gelingt. Ich erkenne eine eigentlich schauspielerische Begabung in ihr. Auch dies Gesicht schwingt jetzt als Perpendikel an der Wand und zwar werden offenbar bei grösser werdendem Ausschlag die Gesichter durch technische Mittel ersetzt. In einer anderen Szene war Emme (die wirklich in dieser Nacht neben mir im Bett lag) ein U-Boot, auf dessen Rumpf ich mit der Hand hinauflangte. Das surrealistische Zimmertheater war so, dass Zuschauer und Akteure durcheinander im Zimmer herumliefen. Auch durch grosse Glasfenster konnte man hineinschauen. (241 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1223 (1953-05-24 - Freiburg)Von Christian von Ferber: Er behandelte meine Zähne in der Nervenklinik. Dabei strömte eine grosse Ruhe von ihm aus. Ich wunderte mich jedoch immer wieder, woher er diese Praxis beherrsche, und fürchtete, er könne zu weit gehen und mir unnötig Zähne ziehen. Er stopfte jedoch eine Watte hinein, die zunächst etwas sperrig im Mund war, dann plötzlich mit einem Ruck in sich zusammenschmolz, in dem ich erwachte. Weiter zurückliegende Szene: Der Weg, der in die Klinik schliesslich führte: Ich lief zum Teil über Eisenbahngeleise, ankommenden Zügen ausweichend, über Felder, auf denen mächtige Walzen arbeiteten, die auf Grund ihrer Kletterfähigkeit und Höhe sogar durch das Bett der Dreisam fuhren, dann über kleine, aus dem Fels schroff aufsteigende Hügelrücken, deren Abhänge die Walze nicht erklettern konnte. Es war dies die Landschaft von Plate und Consrade bei Schwerin. (135 words)

Ich stehe am Gitter, durch das man bequem hindurchgleiten könnte. -- Szenenwechsel: Eine Gesellschaft, diskutierend. Jemand redet von jenem Schacht als einer Menschenpumpe, die Menschen pumpt. Er hat dies geträumt. Ich frage: "Hinein oder hinaus?" Er macht eine hebende Gebärde und antwortet: "Hinaus". Ich sage: "Aha: der Gynäkologe". Es entsteht nun eine allgemeine Diskussion, ob man bei Traumdeutungen solche direkten Fragen stellen dürfe, durch die man ja die Darstellung des Traums beeinflusst. Ich behaupte, dass dies trotzdem richtig sei, weil es auf der Kommunikation beruht. -- Ein kleiner Mann im weissen Kittel, der sich jetzt als Mittelpunkt der Gesellschaft herausstellt, welche ich nun als ein medizinisches Seminar erkenne, scheint sehr eingenommen von meiner Deutung. Er sagt: "Jetzt noch einmal eine ganz einfache Frage, aber nicht für die Begabten: Was ist uns überhaupt im Wort (ergänze: der Traumerzählung) gegeben?" -- Ein rothaariger Wärter im weissen Kittel mit einer Latrine steht auf und sagt: "A B C". -- Der Professor: "Nun, das ist ein wenig zu wenig!" Ich erwache in der Überlegung der Antwort auf seine Frage mit dem Gedanken: Gegeben sind uns überhaupt nur Fragen und kurze, schlaglichtartige Einsichten, die wie ein Blitz im Gespräch alles durchleuchten.

Sie antwortete: "Ja, er ist ja auch schon sieben Monate alt."

Nur weiss ich, dass die Situation, die in der Öffentlichkeit lag, peinlich war, und ich mich zur Wehr setzte. Cocteau traf ich in einer Gesellschaft der Universität. Er äusserte, wenn jemand Fragen habe, möge er sie jetzt an ihn stellen, da er mündlich besser als schriftlich antworten könne.

Ich erwarte Ika und gehe ihr auf Emmes leichten Sandalen, die nur mit einem einzigen Band an den Zehen über den Fuss gehalten sind, entgegen.

Ich versuchte, den Affen durch den Blick in die Augen wie Hunde zu bannen. Doch fand ich mit Entsetzen, dass dies die Bosheit des Affen nicht zu berühren vermochte. Der Blick ging wie durch Glas hindurch. Das Tier war nur primitive Bosheit, die den Blick nicht reflektieren konnte. Im Erwachen erkannte ich schlagartig und mit Heiterkeit die Identität des Affengesichtes mit dem der Frau K., die völlig unansprechbar nur boshafte Dummheit zu sein scheint. Sie wohnt dort im Hause.

Ein grosser Möbelwagen, der wohl ebenfalls wegen des Nitroglycerinwagens quer abbiegen musste, gerät von der Strasse in einen Landweg, kommt, da er sehr hoch gebaut ist, ins Schwanken, und fällt links (von mir vor ihm stehend gesehen) auf einen Zaun. Dieser hält einen Augenblick nur, dann fällt der Wagen mit einem dumpfen Stoss über dem zusammenbrechenden Zaun ganz zur Erde. Die Seitentür der Kabine, jetzt nach oben wie eine Luke führend, wird aufgestossen und heraus klettern ein laut schimpfender Mann, dann noch einer, der Beifahrer, dann zu meinem Erstaunen nacheinander noch drei dicke Frauen, die alle aussehen wie Frau P.

Sie lebt wie in der Zeit der Postkutsche und gilt darum als irr. Ich spreche mit ihr - sie liegt ihm Bett - sehr langsam und ruhig wie ein Psychotherapeut: "Ein Auto, wissen Sie, das ist doch ein Wagen ohne Pferde. Da ist ein grosses Rad, ein Steuer, wie bei einem Schiff, und es sitzt ein Steuermann drin, wie bei einem Schiff. " Da begreift sie. Ihre Augen leuchten wieder auf und sie kann als geheilt gelten. -- Dann eine andere Szene, die mit der vorigen irgendwie zusammenhängt. Bei meiner Schwester, die wohl etwas gegen meine Versuche hat. Gespannte Atmosphäre. Ich suche eine Zigarette und werfe eine leere Simon-Arzt-Schachtel empört zu Boden. Meine Schwester schlägt mir deswegen erzürnt eine Ohrfeige, die jedoch so kräftig ist, dass ich für einen Augenblick bewusstlos auf das Bett falle. Als ich wieder wach werde, stehe ich noch schlaftrunken vom Bett auf und kann mit ausgestrecktem Arm noch ein wenig ungezielt und schwankend wie im Schlaf, wo kleine Bewegungen grösser erscheinen, meiner Schwester eine Ohrfeige geben. Sie hat jedoch schon eine Zigarette angeraucht und gibt mir diese lächelnd. (209 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1237 (1953-07-19 - Freiburg)Ich verliebe mich in ein kleines drahtiges Mädchen, da ich bei einer Tanzübung antreffe. Sie hat sehr schöne orginelle Kleider, aber übereinander, zum Beispiel mehrere Dreiviertelshosen, rote Strümpfe und andere Strümpfe. Ich zeige ihr, dass das nicht nötig ist und jeder für sich besser wirkt. Wir verabreden einen Besuch. Sie wohnt sehr einsam in einem Häuschen am Sternwald. Ich muss zunächst eine breite einsame Strasse hinauf, die über einen endlos breiten und vielgleisigen Bahnübergang führt. Jenseits steht ein Bahnübergang, aber diesseits der Schienengeleise ist die Strasse nächtlich völlig einsam. Ich weiss, dass hier oft Morde geschehen. Auch überquere ich den endlosen Gleiskörper nur mit Sorge, denn ich fühle mich nicht in der Lage, alle Möglichkeiten des Verkehrs zu übersehen, die hier drohen. Jenseits erfahre ich, dass das Häuschen ein wenig seitab von der Strasse in einer Bachschlucht liegt. Diese ist so einsam, dass sie selbst im Sommer tief voll Schnee liegt, durch den ich beglückt hindurch gehe und tanze. Dabei höre ich das Menuett aus dem Don Juan. Das Mädchen wohnt in einer winzigen Baracke, die einen Mann und seine Familie und die Werkstatt beherbergt. An der Tür steht Kinemaker, das heisst. Käsemacher. Ich habe aber den Namen des Mädchens, das als Studentin dort Unterschlupf gefunden hat, vergessen und komme so in Verlegenheit. (213 words)

Der Beamte weiss wahrscheinlich nicht, wessen Bild, das er irgendwo gefunden haben mag, er dort befestigt hat, weil es ihm gefiel. Ich bin merkwürdig berührt von dieser Begegnung. -- Anderer Traum: Gespräch mit Szilasi, zunächst über juristische Fragen, die er in seiner philosophischen Vorlesung mitbehandelt hat. Dabei kommt die Abkürzung FdGB.vor, über deren Bedeutung wir uns nicht im Klaren sind. Ich schlage vor "Freiheit der Grundrechte des Bürgers". Im weiteren Verlauf des Gesprächs schlage ich ein Buch auf, in dem ein Gedicht von Klopstock in Bildern zu einem Teppich gewebt ist. Es sind vor allem Tiere, die in der Bewegung des Rhythmus gegeneinander aufstehen. Doch lese ich das Gedicht ohne weiteres und ohne Befremden wie in einem gedruckten Buch und bin begeistert von der Klarheit und der barocken Kraft und Farbe dieser Form. Erst im Erwachen wird mir klar, dass dies alles im Traum auch wirklich in Farbe und Form eines Teppichs ausgerollt war. (197 words)

Ich schlage vor, einen Termin zu vereinbaren, doch er will sich nicht festlegen. Nächste Szene: Auf dem Flur des Gebäudes -- es ist ein Hotel -- die Tochter des Besitzers, ein Mädchen mit mächtigem Busen und verführerischer Körperlichkeit. Ich stehe ihr mit Dieter zusammen gegenüber. Wir finden keinen Raum für unsere Liebesspiele. Gäste kommen und drohen durch ihre Ankunft, die Szene zu zerstreuen. Ich ziehe sie kurz entschlossen in ein Gastzimmer hinein, das noch leer zu sein scheint. Es trägt die Nummer 75. Der Raum ist leer und riecht nach lange unbenutztem Zimmer, ein wenig moorig. Die Fenster sind geschlossen. Das Mädchen legt sich auf das altmodische Bett. Dieter fragt: "Willst Du Dich nicht ausziehen?" Sie antwortet: "Ich will mich noch etwas wehren, trage ein schwarzes Ellocar-Mieder." Ich denke: Der Film ist also eine Reklame für diese Firma, vielleicht hat sie ihn finanziert. Der andere ist schneller mit dem Ausziehen fertig und liegt schon im Bett bei dem Mädchen. Ich lege, als ich fertig bin, mich dazu, und bemerke, dass er im Rücken des Mädchens liegend, noch eine Zigarette raucht. So schreite ich als erster zur Vereinigung. Szenenwechsel: Wogendes Meer am Strand von Boltenhagen. Ich springe in die See und lasse mich von den Wellen hochwerfen und die Täler wiegen. Die Wellenberge sind so hoch, dass man sie nicht überschauen kann. Die Lust ist sehr gross. Nebenan ist ein Strandstück, das durch ein zaunartiges Gewirr aus Latten sorgfältig abgesperrt ist, für paradiesische Zwecke vorbehalten. Der Lattenzaun reicht noch ein Stück ins Meer hinein, und ich denke, ihn zu umschwimmen. In meinem Rücken zwischen Meer und Strand und am Rande des Zaunes habe ich jetzt ein elektrisches Pumpen- oder Schalterhäuschen entdeckt. (298 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1246 (1953-09-03 - Freiburg)Ich hatte die Aufgabe, kleine Wachsplastiken, die Gisela gemacht hatte und die zerbrochen waren, wieder heil zu machen. Dies gelang mir bei allen ausser einer schmalen, zierlichen Figur, die "der kleine Johannes" genannt wurde. Wenn ich zum Beispiel die Füsse an den Beinen befestigte, brach sie am Bauch wieder durch. Dies war schlimm, denn die Wachsfigur schien von grosser Bedeutung. Szenenwechsel: Ich laufe auf der Strasse mit einem kleinen Jungen. Es ist sehr eilig und ich habe ihn darum um den Bauch gepackt. -- Etwa wie jemand, dem man Schwimmen beibringen will. Plötzlich am Kantstein ein Ausgleiten. Ich schlage hin, packe aber den mit mir gefallenen Jungen gleich und laufe weiter. Nun fällt mir auf, dass sein Körper um vieles leichter geworden ist. Erst später entdecke ich mit Entsetzen Blutspuren in seinem Gesicht, eine merkwürdige Starre in seinem ganzen Körper. Der Junge ist tot. Er muss sich im Aufschlagen den Schädel gebrochen haben. Ich verberge den Leichnam entsetzt in meiner Aktentasche, aus der nur der blutige Kopf hervorragt, und schleppe mich mühsam weiter, seinem Elternhaus entgegen. Dann das Treppenhaus. Ich bitte eine Frau um Hilfe, um mir die Hand zu reichen, da ich die Stufen nicht mehr erklimmen kann und rückwärts hinabzustürzen drohe. Ich halte mich an ihrer Hand wie jemand, der aus dem Schwimmbad steigt. An dem Treppenhaus entdecke ich eine Merkwürdigkeit. Die Treppe gabelt sich in einer der höheren Etagen. Eine führt direkt in den obersten Stock, ohne Zugang zum zweithöchsten (Ich habe diese früher immer benutzt. Man musste dann auf der anderen ein Stück zurückgehen.) Die andere nimmt den normalen Weg von Stock zu Stock. (268 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1247 (1953-09-12 - Freiburg)Das Haus wurde renoviert. Die Baumgärtnerin hatte offenbar schlagartig einen neuen Käufer gefunden. Überall waren die abgefallenen Decken neu vergipst und gestrichen. Zu meinem Entsetzen war das ganze Treppenhaus so mit Farbe bekleckert, dass man sich überall anschmierte. So lavierte ich mich mühsam die übrigens linksläufige (nicht wie in Wirklichkeit rechtsläufige Treppe) hinauf. Die oberste Treppe, die zum Käfig hinaufführte, war vielfach versperrt. Der Gipsstaub lag so hoch, dass er schon fast das Profil der Stufen verwischte. Ein Arbeiter schippte an einem Haufen Sand, auf dem übrigens die grossen Scheiben lagen, die ich gestern Abend (wegen ihres Knoblauchgeschmackes) nicht mochte. Ich musste seine Schaufel gewaltsam festhalten, um mir Durchgang zu verschaffen. Er war mürrisch darüber, doch wurde er freundlich und etwas beschämt, als ich sagte: "Sie haben wohl gar nicht gewusst, dass da oben noch Leute wohnen." Denn er hatte dies nicht gewusst. Dann hatte sich die Szene gewandelt. Ein Gaul stand auf der Treppe und wurde von dem Arbeiter aufgezäumt. Er hatte an der rechten Seite eine merkwürdige Wunde. Ein zweites Pferd, ungezäumt und ungesattelt, kam von oben die Treppe herunter, drängte sich an dem anderen vorbei und stürzte dabei in die Tiefe des Treppenhauses. Bald darauf ein drittes. Es versuchte, das Treppengeländer im Winkel zwischen Treppe und Treppenabsatz wie eine Hürde zu überspringen, oder zu überklettern. Es war wie die Aufnahme eines Sprunges in Zeitlupenaufnahme. Das Pferd versuchte, mit Vorder- und Hinterbein zugleich einen Moment auf dem Geländer zu stehen, um sich zum Absprung zu sammeln, verlor die Balance und stürzte ebenfalls in den Abgrund. Mir entrang sich ein Schrei. Erwachen. (263 words)

Sie trägt einen grossen, ganz flachen Karton mit sich, der mit einem kleinen Band umbunden ist und dessen Rand sie mit dem Rot ihrer geschminkten Lippen nachgezogen hat, so als wenn sie ihn mit einer Kette von Bissen verziert hätte. Der Karton hängt mit einer ihrer früheren Freundschaften zusammen, oder eigentlich: Mit einer, die sie zwischendurch gepflegt hat. Ihr Begleiter, zugleich Hf. und Specht, ist ärgerlich darüber. Eine andere Szene: Gang durch eine foyerartige Strasse. Am Rande, unter anderen Bekannten sitzend, ruft mich eine Freundin herbei und zeigt mir ein merkwürdiges Phänomen: Eine Versammlung von Theatern auf der Strassenseite, an deren Grösse man die Grösse der dazugehörigen Stadt schätzen soll. Ich erkenne das Göttinger Theater, und das "Gelbe Theater von Schwerin", wie ich es im Traum nenne. Daneben sind manche kleine Kuppeln, die direkt auf der Erde stehen, und die man kaum identifizieren kann. (164 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1249 (1953-09-29 - Freiburg)Sehr schöne Träume. Ein Geschwisterpaar, halb Emme und ihr Bruder, halb Antje und der Dr. Gregor Bosch -- doch im Totenreich -- wie in Cocteaus Orphée. Das Glückhafte der Situation lag darin, dass alle irdische Hast und Unruhe von uns abgefallen waren. Wir -- das Mädchen und ich -- liessen und gleichsam zeitlos fallen, in einer Bewegung, die der Szene im Orphée glich, in der die Kamera la princesse de la mort und Orphée zunächst von hinten zeigt, bis beide sich zurücklegen, so dass ihre Gesichter gleichsam über Kopf sichtbar werden. Etwas von der Weltabgeschiedenheit, der eine ganz lange Ewigkeit bevorsteht, war in dem Traum, doch auch der Schrecken um den Tod, der -- geschehen in einem Verkehrsunfall -- gleichsam in einem Moment die Vorzeichen des gesamten Lebens, das im übrigen weiterzugehen schien, verwandelt hatte. Ich überlegte einen Augenblick, ob man vielleicht die Ärzte rufen sollte, da die Bewegungen und die Sprache der beiden Toten noch so sehr an das Leben gemahnten, - aber dann leuchtete mir doch blitzartig die Unumkehrbarkeit des Todes ein. Es lag eine tiefe stille Trauer über den beiden Geschwistern. Ich erfasste plötzlich, dass ich mein Mitleid ganz dem Mädchen zugewandt hatte, das ich liebte, und den Bruder, der ihr Los teilte, darüber vergessen. So wandte ich mich ihm spontan zu und half ihm, dessen Lunge verletzt war. Er hatte eine "Emphysis". (226 words)

Dabei pressten sie ihre Nasen an die Scheiben und ich dachte, sie zu erschrecken, indem ich, für sie unsichtbar, meinen Kopf dem Fenster nähren und laut Buu machen wollte. Indessen gelang es mir wohl, mich im Bett neben dem Fenster aufzurichten, aber ich konnte keinen Laut hervorbringen und war wie gebannt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1261 (1953-11-19 - Freiburg)"Mariage en trois, P., Emme." Sehr faszinierender Traum. Mariage en trois mit Emme und P.. Ich stelle fest, dass dieser die langen schwarzen Haare, die über den Rücken hinabfallen, zum nackten Körper sehr gut stehen. Die Szene, die im Käfig spielt, zeigt die Züge grossen und selbstverständlichen Einverständnisses. Ich liege auf dem Bett mit der roten Decke. Emme sitzt auf der Bettkante. Die P. hockt zusammengekauert an der Fensterseite und kehrt mir ihren nackten Rücken zu. Irgend eine Spannung besteht zwischen beiden nicht. (83 words)

Erstens ein Buch, das ein Bild von .... enthielt, zweitens ein alter medizinischer Text bei einem Professor, der eine Art Medizin-Philosophie machte. E. Stahl sass neben ihm, der sehr elegant war, auf einer Couch....". Das Buch in der ersten Szene enthielt ein Bild eines sehr alten Reliefs oder Gemäldes, das glaube ich eine alte Gottheit zeigte. Die Gestalt hatte eine charakteristische Nackenlinie, die sehr an die Madonna erinnert, die Emme vor längerer Zeit aus Wachs gemacht hat, und die ich gestern wieder in der Hand hielt und betastete. Sie hält ein sehr kleines Kind auf dem Arm. Die zweite Szene spielte in einem Seminar. Ein sehr geistvoller und eleganter Professor hielt dieses in seiner Privatwohnung über alte lateinische Texte, die sowohl philosophische wie medizinische Bedeutung hatten. Es ging ihm um eine Art Philosophie der Medizin. Eleonora Stahl, die Freundin Horst Ihdes, die immer sehr sorgfältig und mit Eleganz gekleidet und geschminkt ist, mit dieser Art zugleich aber eine grosse Herzlichkeit verbreitet, sass neben ihm auf einer Couch, gleichsam auf dem Ehrenplatz.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1264 (1953-11-28 - Freiburg)In einer Stadt am Strom. Überschwemmung. Aus den Fenstern blickend sehe ich die Strassen der Stadt schon als glitzernde Bänder. Menschen hasten über die letzte intakte Brücke, um ins Freie zu kommen, obwohl das Land dort nur wenig ansteigt. Indessen der alte Professor, in dessen Haus wir sind, weiss einen viel kürzeren Weg, in einen Wald, der steil ansteigt, im Norden der Stadt. Wir folgen ihm durch die schon menschenleeren Strassen. Er will dort oben in einem alten Turm wohnen, der sich unmittelbar über der Stadt erhebt, so dass sie dem Blick offen bleibt. (94 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1265 (1953-12-01 - Freiburg)In einem amerikanischen Kino von palastartigen Ausmassen. Es ist schwer, sich auf den vielfältigen Rängen und Treppen durchzufinden. Zu meinem Erstaunen und Entzücken stelle ich fest, dass sowohl alle Frauen und Mädchen unter den Zuschauern wie alle auf der Leinwand in rot-gelb oder blau-weiss gestreifte Kleider gehüllt sind. Das verleiht dem Schauspiel den Charakter eines Festaktes, die Leinwand wird gleichsam zur geistigen Spiegelung des Raumes und in barocker Weise in ihn einbezogen. Andererseits erweckt es den Charakter der Anonymität. Ich setze mich schliesslich auf einen Rangplatz, den ich für den meinen halte, weil er mit der Nummer meiner Karte identisch ist, und treffe den Blick eines rot-gelb gekleideten Mädchens, das hinter mir sitzt. Sehr bald aber bemerke ich, dass ich auf einen falschen Rang geraten bin, da eine Frau erscheint, die den Platz beansprucht. Ich erkundige mich bei den Mädchen nach dem Weg zum richtigen Rang. Sie gibt jedoch nur ungenaue Auskunft und zieht sich hinter ihre Anonymität zurück. Ich stelle während des Gespräches fest, dass ich die englische Sprache besser zu handhaben verstehe, als ich gedacht hatte. Die Treppen zwischen den Rängen sind scheinbar unsystematisch verteilt und schwer zu finden. So gelange ich über eine Wendeltreppe auf einen hochgelegenen geräumigen Balkon mit harten, unbequemen Stühlen, auf denen aber niemand sitzt. Dann entdecke ich im freien Raum vor der Brüstung viele Blumen in gleichsam hier nur abgestellten Kästen und einen Gärtner, der mich etwas bestürzt und in deutscher Sprache anspricht: "Was wollen Sie den hier? Hier ist doch nur ein Arbeitsraum." Ganz in der Ferne, am anderen Ende des Saales entdecke ich die Leinwand, deren Betrachtung er sich offenbar gerade zugewendet hatte und auf der zwar scharf, aber nur sehr klein und merkwürdig entrückt die Figuren des Filmes sichtbar sind, der von hier aus beinahe nebensächlich scheint. -- Ich begebe mich erneut auf die Suche nach meinem richtigen Platz. Szenenwechsel: In einem Haus am Marktplatz einer Stadt. Ich habe ein Gewehr in der Hand und blicke aus dem Fenster auf den Platz, auf dem junge Männer und Mädchen mit herrlich geformten, gleichsam durchmodellierten Körpern, deren innere Dynamik im Spiel der Muskeln und Formen hervortritt, sich in kleinen Dreieckshosen und teilweise nackt dem Ballspiel hingeben. Ich erfasse sie wie Tiere auf der Wildbahn, die der Schuss im idealen Moment der Bewegung erlegt. Einen Augenblick lang erfasst mich ein Bedenken -- doch dann ist die Jagdleidenschaft, die die Bewegung und die Enthülltheit des ganzen Körpers in ihrer Unbedingtheit erfasst, in mir von grösserem Recht. Ich erfasse einen schlanken und im Sprunge ausgestreckten Körper in dem Augenblick, wo er sich von der Erde gelöst hat und gleichsam im ruhenden Punkt des Sprunges verharrt, und drücke ab. Szenenwechsel: Die Mechanik der Büchse hat aus einem mir unerfindlichen Grunde versagt. Ich bin gerade damit beschäftigt, das Magazin mit der Munition herauszureissen, weil ich draussen Schritte höre und die Büchse wenigstens nur im ungeladenen Zustande bei mir haben will. Die Kugel ist, wie nach dem Treffer, eingedrückt, und die Ladung kommt als schwarze verkohlte Masse aus der Patrone, wobei ich mir nicht klar bin, ob sie noch zündfähig ist oder nicht. Ich schütte sie vorsichtig auf die Fensterbank. Erwachen. (523 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1266 (1953-12-02 - Freiburg)Bei Heidegger, den ich zufällig getroffen habe. Er sitzt direkt neben mir, mir den Rücken zukehrend, und unterhält sich mit mir über die Schulter, während ich an seinem Radio drehe. Er sagt: "Stellen Sie "AFN" ein, die bringen immer so schöne Musik zwischen den Messen, - die ist fein und zierlich." (Ich habe dabei die Vorstellung von frühbarocker Musik oder von alten gotischen Rankenverzierungen im Stile der Minnesängerhandschriften). Heidegger ist sehr unmittelbar und unumwunden in seiner Art. Er zitiert irgend ein plattdeutsches Sprichwort. Ich sage: "Das ist doch von Fritz Reuter." Er: "Ja, aus dem Gedicht: 'Die Ohrfeige'". -- Später meint er in diesem Zusammenhang: "Genialität muss viel leiden." (109 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1272 (1953-12-11 - Freiburg)Auf dem Wege zur neuen Wohnung. Der Winkel der Strasse, den ich einzuschlagen habe, verschiebt sich im Verhältnis zur alten nur ein wenig. Die Wohnung scheint in einer Parallelstrasse zu liegen. Das Treppenhaus ist fremd, vermisst die ruinenhafte Freiheit der alten. Dann in der Wohnung. Ich sage zu Emme: "Du, meinen Käfig muss ich aber behalten", und stelle mir dabei seine Lage ein wenig entfernt vor -- da plötzlich fällt mir beglückend ein, dass diese unsere Wohnung ja nur die natürliche Einheit ist von Emmes Zimmer und meinem Käfig, die beide beieinander liegen, dass der Käfig ja dazugehört, und in der Wohnung liegt. Dann sind wir im Käfig. Die Optik aus seinen Fenstern und sozusagen seine Lage im Raum hat sich ein wenig verändert, denn ich kann jetzt aus den vielen kleinen Fenstern über dem Bett einen grösseren Raum überschauen und blicke nicht nur wie früher aus den Fensterchen neben dem Kopfende, sondern aus allen zugleich, vor allem auch aus dem Fenster am anderen Ende des Bettes, dessen Scheibe übrigens am Ende eine Biegung hat, die auch den Blickwinkel vergrössert. Ich liege so auf dem Bett, dass ich alles zugleich überschaue. Andere Szene: Fahrt in einem Omnibus, in dem ich sehr hoch über der Strasse sitze und die Lastautos gleichsam unter mir vorbeifahren. Die ungewohnte Optik lässt den Verkehr gefährlich erscheinen. Doch verlasse ich mich auf den Fahrer. Andere Szene: Rückweg zu Fuss, Strasse am Rande eines Zoos. Die jungen Tiger sind ausgebrochen. Die Strassenpassanten halten sie für harmlos, doch ich sehe ihre kraftvolle Geschmeidigkeit und zum Sprung und Stoss bereit, mit dem ich die Tiere im Falle ihres Angriffs abzuwehren gedenke. Der Weg ist langsam und schwer zu überwinden. Die Geschmeidigkeit und Farbigkeit der Tiere ist faszinierend. Erwachen. (289 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1273 (1953-12-24 - Freiburg)Gang durch die Strassen, die ins Elternhaus führen. Rechts auf einem Hügel das Ende eines Strassenbahngeleises, auf dem ein einzelner altmodischer Wagen steht, mit zwei Mann bemannt und anscheinend zur Abfahrt bereit. Ich eile hinauf, um den Anschluss zu bekommen, und sehe, dass die Geleise von diesem Endpunkt aus in sehr altmodischer Gleisführung zunächst ein Stückchen steil bergab führen, ehe sie auf die normale ebene Strasse führen. Der junge und sehr freundliche Schaffner, fragt mich, ob ich denn bremssicher wäre. Man müsse sich sehr scharf in die Kurven legen und die Bremsen bedienen, während der Fahrt über den Abhang. Er pflege diese Stück mit dem Fahrer allein zu fahren. Ich solle lieber unten einsteigen. Ich könne ihm aber einen grossen Gefallen tun, wenn ich ihm für den Sonntag fünf Zigaretten hole und zwei Briketts -- die gebe es im selben Laden. "Wissen Sie, der ist da hinten, wenn Sie den Paulshöherweg hinuntergehen". Ich sage: "Ja, die Strasse heisst doch 'Im alten Dorfe'". -- Er antwortet: "Ja, da ist der kleine Laden." Mir schwebt das Bild einer Strasse mit alten Dorfhäusern vor, die irgendwie seitab führen, und ich mache mich auf den Weg. Die Strasse ist aber schwer zu finden. Sie muss irgendwie da, wo der Paulshöherweg, der auf die Cäcilienallee herabführt, dort wo er in diese (das ist die Strasse, die ins Elternhaus führt) mündet, abzweigen. Die Szene wandelt sich dann. Es sind unwirtliche Wirtschaftsgebäude von dem Charakter etwas alter Kontore. Dort muss eine Kohlenhandlung sein. Irgend jemand, ich glaube meine Schwester, ruft: "Ist hier eine Kohlenhandlung?"

Während der Fürst, ein bärbeissiger Herr, mir Vorhaltungen macht, dass ich seine FF-Nadel trage, und ich ihm erwidere, dass ich sie von meinem Vater geerbt habe, spielen seine Kinder, ein Bub und drei Mädchen, im Treppenhaus, in dessen Halle wir stehen. Und zwar schleudert der Junge die Mädchen im Spiel so über die Brüstung, dass sie auf einem Treppenabsatz landen und zwei sofort tot sind und schlaff und merkwürdig verkleinert wie die Puppen daliegen. Der Fürst stürzt empört die Treppe hinauf. Doch in diesem Moment springt der Bub selbst in gewagtem Sprung über die Brüstung, fällt aber so unglücklich vor die Füsse des Herzogs, dass er sofort tot ist. Dieser zieht die Leiche in einem Ausbruch verzweifelten Schmerzes auf seinen Schoss. Sein Zorn ist in Verzweiflung umgeschlagen, und der Verlust des Thronerben berührt ihn schwerer als der Tod der Töchter. (144 words)

Ich will ihr zu Hilfe eilen, doch sie macht eine abwehrende Bewegung mit den Worten: "Sie kennen diesen Hengst nicht!" Das braune Tier bleibt unbeweglich stehen, ebenso die Frau mit dem erhobenen Fuss im Steigbügel. Sie scheint das Problem durch Abwarten lösen zu wollen. Das Bild ist wie eine Statue.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1279 (1953-12-28 - Freiburg)Noch ein Traum aus der Zeit bald nach dem 20.12.1953: Emmes Geschwister sind bei uns zu Besuch. Die Buben machen allerhand Streiche, während Emmes Schwester, Gärdle, sich Emmes schwarzen Hüftgürtel umgeschnallt hat, den sie ohne Hosen trägt. Sie will sich auf dem Bett, auf dem ich liege, niederlassen, und setzt sich dabei, ohne es zu wissen, gerade so auf meinen Fuss, dass dieser zwischen ihre Beine kommt und die Scheide berührt. Sie fährt erregt und mit einer für sie typischen Abwehr wieder hoch und vermutet hinter dem Zufall meine Absicht, während ich nur nichts getan hatte, um ihn zu verhindern.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1281 (1953-12-30 - Freiburg)Tante Lelli (hat Tannenbaum mit). Mit ihr Gang durch Spiegels Wohnung. Auch mein Vater bei ihr. Ich überlege, ob er nicht bei uns wohnen könne. Es ist aber unklar, wie viele Zimmer wir eigentlich haben, ob zwei oder drei. Es scheint immer noch ein drittes da zu sein -- ein schmales, sehr schön eingerichtetes Zimmer mit Empireofen und Geschirr in Zwiebelmuster, blau-weiss, auch Silbergeräten. Doch bei näherer Orientierung ist das Zimmer immer wieder weg. Ich suche danach mit Emme gemeinsam durch die Räume schreitend. Vorher andere Szene: Ich werde mit einem Autobus in der Stadt abgesetzt und suche die Talstrasse mit unserer Wohnung, die ich in der Nähe vermute. Mir ist aber die Strasse, in der wir abgesetzt wurden, unbekannt, und der Weg zieht sich in die Länge. Ich frage einen Passanten, und dieser erklärt mir einiges, aus dem ich plötzlich, schlagartig, entnehmen kann, dass ich gar nicht in Freiburg, sondern in Göttingen bin. Die Landschaft leuchtet mir sofort in dieser anderen Orientierung ein. Ich erkenne in der Ferne die leichten schneebedeckten Berge der Gleichen. Zugleich befällt mich eine tiefe Schwermut, denn in Göttingen bin ich fremd, und kann nicht wie in Freiburg nach Hause gehen. Dann wieder zeitweise scheint mir Göttingen wir früher vertraut. So wechselt auch hier dauernd die Orientierung. Der Passant beschreibt mir den Weg -- denn auch in Göttingen scheint es eine Talstrasse zu geben, die ich bisher nicht kannte, die mich aber natürlich gar nicht interessiert. Er erklärt den Weg, den man übersehen kann, anhand eines Gebäudes einer Spielbank, von der ich schon einmal gehört zu haben meine. Sie liegt an einem alten Sandweg. Dann führt der von ihm vorgeschlagene Gang über die Universitätsinstitute in die Stadt. Daran anschliessend dann die Szene: Gang mit der alten Tante Lelli, die den Tannenbaum hat. Wir gehen besuchsweise auf unserem Weg durch die Wohnung von Spiegels, doch diese sind wie meist, wenn unerwarteter Besuch kommt, etwas bestürzt und fürchten, er wolle dort logieren. Dann jetzt auch in Begleitung meines Vaters (der so aussieht wie auf dem Bild mit der goldenen Uhr). Gang zu unserer Freiburger Wohnung, die aber schlossartige Züge hat, ein wenig wie Giselas und Peters Wohnung im Harburger Schloss. Hier dann anschliessend die Szene mit dem dritten Zimmer. Beim Erwachen scheint sich der Glanz dieses dritten Zimmers mit der quadratischen Räumlichkeit des bekannten Zimmers zu einer Einheit zu verbinden. Es ist wie die Lösung eines Vexierbildes, die im Durchschauen seiner Dynamik liegt. (406 words)

Emme ist tief unten im Keller und kommt nicht zu mir herauf. So liege ich unendlich einsam in dieser Nacht in meinem Bett und sehne mich nach all der Liebe, die mir verschlossen scheint. Vor jenem Traume war noch eine andere Szene: Wir bewohnten in diesem Stockwerk nicht nur das Zimmer, in dem wir jetzt schlafen, und den Käfig, sondern auch Roguszkas Wohnung mit ihren zwei Zimmern, die aber sehr sonnig waren, mit Veranden und Balkons, so dass alles sehr aufgelockert und heiter war. Auch Antje oder Ricarda (wie in der letzten Szene) spielten in diesen Traum hinein (aus dem wohl in der anderen Szene die Lage im Dachgeschoss erhalten blieb). Ich bemerkte zur Baumgärtnerin, dass wir so eigentlich über unsere Verhältnisse wohnten, da wir ja noch Mietschulden bei ihr hätten (entspricht den Tatsachen). (159 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1288 (1954-01-16 - Freiburg)In einer Universität. Es ging darum, ob Szilasi in seinem Lehrstuhl bestätigt werden sollte oder Heiss. Für einen von beiden war es nur möglich und Szilasi, dem es angeboten war, hatte darum Bedenken. Ich musste ihn in dieser Frage beraten und entschied mich für ihn. Das Argument, das ich ihm vorführte, war dieses: für ihn sei dies eine einmalige Chance, Heiss dagegen sei jünger und werde als bekannter Psychologe diese Bestätigung sowieso erhalten. Die Szene spielte in einem schlossartigen Gebäude von würfelartiger Form. Szilasis Arbeitsraum war in der Nähe der Küche, deren moderne mechanische Geräusche (das Zischen der Kesselventile) uns störte. Ich fragte die Köchin, ob sie dies Geräusch nicht vermeiden könnte. Sie verneinte. Die Verhandlung über Szilasis Fall war langwierig und vertraulich. Die Situation war so, dass sowohl Heiss wie Szilasi einen halben Lehrstuhl hatten und nur einen von beiden nur ganz bestätigt werden konnte, der andere wie vorher bleiben musste. (152 words)

Die Mitfahrenden (es ist ein militärischer Transport und Kriegssituation) halten die Gewässer für echte Seen, da sie die Landschaft nicht kennen; ich kann sie nur mühsam überzeugen, indem ich einzelne, nur wenig vom Wasser überspülte Geleise und Bahnübergänge in der Landschaft zeige, die das Land als bebautes ausweisen. -- Vor allem zeige ich ihnen links das Schloss mit seinen vielen Kuppeln und Türmchen, das wie im Märchen leuchtend dasteht, und daneben das klassizistisch gebaute Museum. Der Zug bewegt sich in Richtung auf das Elternhaus (und zwar dort, wo eigentlich die Strassenbahnlinie führte) und hebt sich in der Gegend des Schweizerhauses (dort wo auch die Strassenbahnlinie steil ansteigt) aus dem Überschwemmungsgelände, um einen Hügel zu überwinden. Ich erinnere mich, von Claudia gehört zu haben, dass auch zwei Feldwege (die zum Exerzierplatz gehören) unbegehbar seien wegen Überschwemmung. Das Gelände ist noch von den Russen besetzt (also wohl auch das Elternhaus).

Wir suchen einen Grabstein für mich heraus. Es ist dort üblich, dass man dies schon zu Lebzeiten tut. Die Steine sind merkwürdig mit buntem Stoff überzogen und werden auch so aufgestellt. Der Stoff soll recht haltbar sein. Das Ganze mutet recht amerikanisch an. Wir wählen für mich ein Blümchenmuster. Die Werkstatt scheint leer zu sein, doch sehe ich ein Bett, etwas unordentlich mit einer Decke zugedeckt, das wohl zur Aufbahrung der Toten dient. Doch dann entdecke ich dahinter ein zweites Bett, das alle Züge vom Gebrauch eines Lebenden trägt. Ein Nachttisch mit Weckuhr und manchen Kleinigkeiten steht daneben. Die Decke ist frisch aufgeworfen, als wenn der Schläfer eben herausgeschlüpft sei. Offenbar die Schlafstatt des Meisters. Doch nun entdecke ich auch auf dem Bett, das wir den Toten zuschrieben, eine Bewegung. Eine alte, etwas verknöcherte Frau -- offenbar die Meisterin -- kommt unter der Decke hervor, die sie ganz über sich gezogen hatte. Wir fliehen entsetzt durch die Tür hinaus, die noch im Spalt offen steht, und noch während die Erwachende sich reckt, die mir nur einige Schimpfworte nachzurufen scheint. (203 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1296 (1954-01-23 - Freiburg)Im Ausbruch eines Krieges. Ich fahre mit dem Rad in schneller Geschwindigkeit auf einer geraden Strasse. Lastautos und grosse Trecker und allerlei kriegerische Fahrzeuge rasen im Taumel einer Mobilmachung durcheinander. Es scheint alles nur kurz an schweren Zusammenstössen und Verkehrsunglücken vorbeizugehen. Ich betrachte das Dämonische und Gefährliche in diesem Bild mit einer gewissen Lust. Vor mir eine riesige Autobahnbrücke, die die Strasse überquert, aber konstruiert als eine Zugbrücke, die gerade heruntergelassen wird -- eine mächtige Metallkonstruktion. Gleichzeitig mit den Brückenteilen geht eine Schranke herunter, die für Sekunden meine Strasse sperrt, auf der ich aber noch entfert, wenn auch in grossem Tempo, mich der Brückenunterführung nähere. Die Schranke wird sofort, nachdem die Brückenfugen oben geschlossen sind, wieder hochgezogen. Ich sehe einen Mann, der oben an der Brücke beschäftigt ist, aus grosser Höhe auf die Strasse herabstürzen. Er ist sofort tot und wenige Momente später fahre ich schaudernd an der erstarrten Leiche vorbei. Dann ein Flieger, der unter der Brücke, die er wohl treffen wollte, eine Bombe wirft und dabei Frauen und Kinder auf ihren Fahrzeugen, Wagen und Rädern trifft. Ich fahre unmittelbar durch die Verwundeten und Schreienden hindurch, die einen grausigen Anblick bieten, erfasse aber mit einem Blick, dass genügend Unverwundete da sind, die die Verletzten und Blutbespritzen auf ihre Räder laden und sofort weiterfahren in Richtung auf die Stadt, aus der ich komme. Auch eine Polizeistreife auf einem Kraftrad braust heran. Ich sehe, wie die Männer mit den weissen Mützen, sofort einige verwundete Frauen in ihren Beiwagen laden. Ich halte nicht an, sondern lenke mein Rad, das beinahe federnd, wie von selber, fährt, in grosser Geschwindigkeit durch die Schreienden, Blutüberströmten und vielleicht Sterbenden hindurch, da ich meinem Ziel, der Front, zustreben muss, und erwache mit Schaudern. Danach langes schlafloses Wachliegen und Grübeln. (292 words)

Die Szene hatte etwas Geheimnisvolles. -- Anderer Traum: Fahrt in einem Lastauto durch Bergwaldwege. Ein Fahrgestell oder anderes Wrack liegt im Wege. Der Fahrer biegt kurzentschlossen vom Weg ab, einen steilen Abhang hinunter. Ich mache mich auf einen Überschlag des Wagens gefasst, doch dem Fahrer gelingt es, den Wagen in einen gleitenden Kurve den Hang heil hinunter zu lenken und unten auf einer geraden Strasse weiter zu führen, die dann -- glaube ich -- auf den oben beschriebenen Friedhof führte, so dass jene Szene dieser erst folgte.

Nur ist dieser in dem Traum nicht Peter, sondern Hf.. Die beiden Betten sind sozusagen wie zwei Wohnungen. So ist auch Giselas in anderer Weise eingerichtet, als wir es getan hätten. Es hängen Bilder da, die Alpenveilchen darstellen, und andere weniger strenge als gefällige Dinge. Ich will dies alles -- Gisela ist gerade fortgegangen -- in Ruhe betrachten, und rate darum ihrem Mann -- Hf. --, so lange in das Kistle zu gehen, wo Emme noch schläft und sich dort so lange hinzulegen. -- Emme, als sie erwacht, ist empört, dass der verhasste Hf. im Kistle ist, denn sie hat gedacht, ich wäre es. Nächste Szene: Ein empörtes Kind -- es ist Emme als Zwei- oder Dreijährige mit dem weissen, ein wenig drollig wirkenden Mützchen auf dem Kopf -- läuft unten um das Haus herum -- es ist mein Elternhaus in Schwerin. Ich schaue aus einem Hinterfenster. Um das Kind zu beschwichtigen, lasse ich zuerst eine Postkarte, dann einen Gliederkaktus, Weihnachtskaktee, herausgleiten, die in Kurven herabsegelt und sich im Flug zu wunderbaren violetten Blüten entfaltet, die das Kind beglücken.

Ich eilte hastig, um in Hamburg einen D-Zug zu erreichen, der mich nach Freiburg bringen sollte, sah aber meine Chance schwinden, da der Bahnhof ein weitläufiges Gebäude bildete, in dem Schalterhallen und Bahnsteige wie die Anlagen eines Industriegeländes durch lange Wege getrennt waren. Da entdeckte ich in der Nähe eines Schalters Christian Ferber in sehr gemächlichen Bewegungen. Ich hatte ihn hier nicht erwartet und begrüsste ihn erfreut. Er erklärte mir, dass er mit sehr langsamen Zügen heimfahren wolle, um das Reisen zu geniessen. Ich fühlte mich hiervon angesteckt und spürte grosse Lust, mit ihm zu reisen. Im Begriff, ihm dieses zu erklären, erwachte ich. -- Vorher noch eine andere Szene, in der ich mit dem Fahrstuhl durch ein grosses Geschäftshaus fuhr, auf der Suche nach einem jungen Rechtsanwalt, der in einem der Stockwerke sein Büro hatte. Da geschah es, dass mein Fahrstuhl sich aus dem Gehäuse, aus seinem Schacht begab, und die Treppe hinablief. Ich hielt dies zunächst für selbstverständlich, bis mich Passanten auf die Gefahr aufmerksam machten, in der ich schwebte. So konnte ich gerade noch rechtzeitig den Halte-Knopf drücken, der die Kabine zum stehen brachte. (191 words)

Ich ergriff hastig einen an Hasselblatt adressierten Brief, in dem Einzelheiten über die Gefährlichkeit der Schlange aufgezeichnet sein mussten. Auf dem Wege zum nächsten Arzt brach ich den Brief auf, der den Namen des Absenders von Stickdorn trug und aus dem Norden kam. Die Hülle enthielt aber nur einen zweiten Brief, der den Namen des Absenders von Bentivegni führte. Ich riss auch diesen auf, sah aber zu meinem Entsetzen, dass er eine winzige Schlange enthielt, die an der Luft sofort anschwoll, und als ich den Raum verliess und die Tür hinter mir zuschlug, schon die Grösse einer grünen Gurke erreicht hatte.

Doch je mehr ich mit dem Knüppel aushole, um den Kopf der Gans abzuwehren, um so mehr wächst die Gefahr, dass die Gans durch jeden Schlag aggressiver wird.

Ich weiss nicht, ob ich es mit dem Fuss fortstossen oder durch scharfes Rufen in Schach halten soll. Ich versuche das Letztere, doch kaum mit Erfolg.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1308 (1954-02-25 - Freiburg)Träume von Heidegger und Hartmann. Zunächst Heidegger. Ich traf ihn Klavier spielend. Er brachte eine wunderbare Klangvielfalt und Farbigkeit in sein Instrument. Er beendete sein Spiel und sah mich erst, als er sich vom Instrument erhob. Wir waren offenbar verabredet, denn er sagte zu einem Diener: "Leider -- dann muss ich aufhören." Dieser Satz lähmte mir fast die Zunge, so dass ich nichts herausbrachte, als er auf dem Heimweg mir befahl, ihm Fragen über meine Arbeit zu stellen, die er gelesen hatte. Ich hatte von ihm Fragen erwartet und erwiderte darum, ich hätte keine Fragen auswendig gelernt, so gehe das nicht. Während ich dies noch begründete, sagte er: "Nicht so lang. Jeder nur immer einen Satz" -- damit ein Gespräch andeutend, in dem die Rede und Widerrede wie Tennisbälle hin und her gingen. Ich schwieg darum eine Weile. Erwachen. -- In einer anderen Szene Gespräch mit Nicolai Hartmann. Die Atmosphäre hatte etwas von jener Ausgewogenheit, die ihm eigen war. Einzelheiten habe ich vergessen. Eine dritte Szene: Gespräch mit einem jüngeren Mann, der Töpferwaren Heideggers gesammelt hatte, Krüge, die Heidegger und wohl seine Schüler gemacht hatten. Auch psychologische Momente spielten in dem Gespräch eine Rolle. Sie bezogen sich auf die Gestalt. Die Gefässe waren im Stil der Volksdorfer Werkstatt von Monika Maetzel (bei der Ika arbeitet). In einem Krug war die gestreifte Ritzung der Glasur am Rande durch die Hitze des Brandes in einem rechten Winkel umgebogen, so dass eine Picasso ähnliche Form zustande kam, die in sich sehr gelungen war. Mein Gesprächspartner schien diese Form nicht so sehr zu schätzen, weil sie ein Spiel des Zufalls sei. Ich erwiderte, dies sei kein Einwand, weil jene unberechenbare Einwirkungen des Brandes gerade charakteristisch seien für den Charme und die Schönheit der Tongefässe. Ihm schien dieses Argument einzuleuchten. Auch sagte ich, sei es das Wesen des Herstellens, dass es nur das schon von sich her Anwesende zum Stehen bringe. Mit diesem Gedanken wachte ich auf.

Onkel Adolf warnt mich vor einem Pfau, der stets versucht, durch ein unverglastes Fenster in die langsam fahrende Bahn einzudringen. Ich versuche, mich mit einer Pappe hinter dem Fenster zu schützen.

Die Baumgärtnerin ist entsetzt darüber und befürchtet, es könnten die ihren sein. Andere Szene: In einer Turnhalle, die mit Matratzen ausgelegt ist. Darunter entdecke ich einen Keller, in dem man durch Beiseiteschieben der Matratzen gelangt. Ich steige durch die Luke hinab und entdecke unten Faschingsfarben und Masken, die entlang der Wände gestapelt sind. Es handelt sich um ein Wehrmachtslager. Ich höre die Stimmen meiner Begleiter, die nach mir suchen. Dann öffnet sich seitlich eine Tür, die direkt aus dem Keller ins Freie führt, und herein kommt ein General, dessen Stiefel ich von hinten sehe und der mich fast zu treten droht, da er mich -- geblendet von der Helle des Tages nicht sehen kann. Szenenwechsel: Fasching. Ein Mädchen, von dem ein starker Funke zu mir überspringt. Doch nach der ersten Annäherung weicht sie zurück, um sich nur erneut zu öffnen und erneut zurückzuweichen. Ich bin verwirrt durch dieses Spiel, bis ich auf ihrem Kopf eine Mütze entdecke, es ist eine Militärmütze, die ein Band trägt mit der Aufschrift: "Gott liebt alle Völker".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1315 (1954-03-20 - Freiburg)Seminar eines Ausländers (dessen Namen mit der Silbe Bu- anfing.) Auch Heidegger war zu diesem Seminar erschienen und ich ging darum dort hin, obwohl ich nicht wusste, ob Szilasis Seminar nicht zur gleichen Zeit stattfinden würde. Nun schaute auch noch Szilasi zur Tür herein. Später erfuhr ich, dass Szilasi in diesem Semester keine Seminare mehr halten würde. Andere Szene: Auseinandersetzung mit Heiss in einem Seminar. Er hatte zunächst uns Protokolle von Träumen vorgelesen und wollte dann Bilder zeigen, die zu den Träumen gehörten und von denen gemalt waren, die sie geträumt haben. Er hat die Bilder auf seinem Schoss und blätterte noch darin, um sie den Träumen zuzuordnen. Dabei hob er ein Bild auf, dessen Zugehörigkeit er nicht erkannte und sagte vor sich hin: "Wozu gehört das?". Ich sass neben ihm und sagte: "Zu der Küche". Es handelte sich um einen Traum, der in einer Küche spielte, das Bild zeigte -- in Tusche gemalt - eine gelbe Figur in dem Raum, in impressionistischem Stil und verschwimmenden Konturen. Heiss war empört, dass ich dazwischen geredet hatte, und tadelte mich. Ich erwiderte ihm, wir seien schliesslich in einem Seminar, und da seien Rede und Widerrede üblich. Dann stand ich empört auf und sagte, ich werde gehen. Heiss erwiderte: "Dann gehen Sie". Nun setzte ich mich wieder: "Jetzt bleibe ich gerade!". Das Seminar war inzwischen auf einen kleinen Schülerkreis von Heiss zusammengewachsen. Ich gewahrte, dass ich unversehens in einen esoterischen Kreis hineingeraten war, und erwachte empört. Ich ärgerte mich über meine Inkonsequenz, und dass ich doch geblieben war. (255 words)

(Dieser Umstand im Traum entsprach der äusseren Wirklichkeit, denn wir blieben an diesem Morgen tatsächlich lange in den Tag liegen). Unsere Gastgeber guckten ab und zu herein, und ich nahm dies wahr, weil ich nicht so fest schlief wie Emme. Zuletzt kam die Gastgeberin auf ihren leichten Füssen herein -- es war Adelheid, die Frau des Malers Dorwarth, die aber zugleich Züge von meiner Cousine Gisela trug, - und hatte in ihrer Hand eine kleine Muck, die sie fliegen liess, um Emme damit zu wecken.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1319 (1954-03-30 - Freiburg)In der Eisenbahn. Ich habe meine Koffer geöffnet, und ein Teil meiner Sachen ist irgendwo hinten unter die Bänke geraten. Kurz vor der Ankunft des Zuges in Freiburg beginne ich, die Sachen zu suchen, doch zu meinem Schrecken finde ich immer wieder Dinge, die nicht mir gehören, mit ihnen vermengt, zum Beispiel weibliche Unterwäsche. Auch die Kreissäge, weisser Strohhut meines Vaters, ist dabei. Ich bemühe mich mühsam, die Sachen zu entwirren, während sich die Station bedrohlich nähert und ergreife schliesslich meinen Schlafanzug und andere Sachen und klemme sie unter den Arm, um überhaupt die Koffer zu zu kriegen, während schon die Lokomotive beim Einfahren in den Freiburger Bahnhof pfeift. Ich erwache von dem Pfeifen und höre draussen in derselben Tonhöhe die Fabrikpfeifen, die zur Morgenschicht pfeifen. Vorher andere Szene: Mit meinem Vater in einem Ballett-Theater. Der Vorhang funktioniert nicht richtig, so dass man ausser den tanzenden Mädchen auf der Bühne auch die Garderobe sieht -- es ist eine improvisierte Bühne -, in der ein Mädchen mit eng anliegenden Tanzkostüm, das die Schenkel und Arme freilässt, vor einem Toilettenspiegel sitzt, und seine geöffneten Haare frisiert. Ich finde dieses Bild gerade reizvoll, doch komme ich den Bitten der Anderen nach und bringe den schweren roten Samtvorhang, der mit einem leichten Goldbrokatstreifen verziert ist, so in Ordnung, dass er richtig schliesst. Der Vorhang hatte sich seitenverkehrt, so dass man seine Rückseite sah, und lief darum nicht über die Stange. (236 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1320 (1954-03-30 - Freiburg)Erste Szene: Altes Haus am Wasser, im Winkel zum Ufer gebaut, wie in Freiburg an der Dreisam, doch in einer anderen Stadt. Wir stehen in einiger Entfernung und beobachteten das Haus. Emme weint. Ein Mädchen, das in dem Haus wohnt, soll helfen. Sie ist wie ein Bild von Rubens, Tänzerin und Musikerin. Doch wissen wir, dass sie nicht zu Hause ist, und beobachten alle Passantinnen, denken, dass sie vielleicht nach zehn Uhr zurückkommen wird und unter Umständen vorher ein Konzert gehört hat. -- Andere Szenen, die entweder vor oder nach dieser Szene spielte: Erste Szene: Ich fahre mit Emme auf Rädern durch einen Hohlweg im Kornfeld nach Norden. Dort, wo der Weg sich öffnet und das Kornfeld endent, steht ein blühender Rot-oder Weissdorn (es war eigentlich eine helle Farbe, ich schrieb aber unwillkürlich in die Skizze "Rotdorn". Es befindet sich zusätzlich zum Traum eine Skizze, die das Ganze Traumgeschehen gleichsam geographisch darstellt.) Dort erschliesst sich eine weite Sicht über ein Stoppelfeld auf die Chaussee, die nach Nordosten führt. Ein Junge fragt nach dem Weg und will über das Stoppelfeld fahren. Wir raten ihm, den Feldweg zur Linken zu fahren, der die Chaussee bei einer Überführung trifft. Ein wenig weiter nördlich wird er eine zweite Überführung finden, die unserer Sicht durch einen Hügel verdeckt ist. Wir beschreiben ihm, wie er von dort weiter seinen Weg nehmen muss. (Hier liegt die Geographie von Volksdorf zu Grunde, wo der unübersichtliche Weg zum Bahnhof unter zwei solchen Überführungen hindurchführt). Auch wir folgen dem Feldweg zur Chaussee, pflücken aber vorher noch eine Blüte von dem Dornbusch und wenden uns dann auf der Chaussee nach Süden, also in entgegengesetzter Richtung zu unserer bisherigen Fahrt, und gelangen in die Stadt, wo wir auf einer Kreuzung, die der Freiburger Kreuzung am Bertholdsbrunnen entspricht, einen Polizisten passieren und ein Stückchen weiter ein verschlossenes Tor erreichen, das seiner Lage nach dem Martinstor entspricht, aber sonst wie die ganze Traumstadt nicht mit dem Stadtbild von Freiburg identisch ist. Wir öffnen das schwere Tor und finden uns auf einem grossen Paradeplatz, der von Soldaten mit Helmen erfüllt ist, die dort das Stuttgarter Kammerorchester hören sollen. (Eben dies ist wohl das Konzert, das auch das Mädchen aus dem Haus am Wasser hören würde). Wir überqueren den Platz und wenden uns nach Westen, um den Heimweg auf einem glatten, etwas zur Seite abschüssigen Wege anzutreten, der am Wasser entlang führt. (Die Lage unseres Hauses entspricht also orientierungsmässig derjenigen unserer Freiburger Wohnung, obwohl das Landschaftsbild des Traumes ländlich ist). Ich fühle, wie mich von hinten jemand auf dem Rade überholen will, während es mir nicht gelingt, auf meinem Rad nach rechts auszuweichen. Ich rufe ihm zu: "Fahr langsam, den mich zieht die Schwerkraft." (448 words)

Sie kommt mit Schokolade, Tobler-o-rum und anderen schokoladenen Kostbarkeiten und ich glaube mit Schlagsahne oder etwas Weissem. Und sie ist völlig verwandelt, heiter und glücklich, dass ich beglückt bin. So steht sie bei Emme und mir, strahlt in einer gewissen Unschuldigkeit und umklammert meinen Leib mit einer berückenden Sinnlichkeit, ohne wieder loszulassen. Hängt sich schlangengleich an mir herab. Ihre Gestalt hat sich verändert. Sie ist nicht mehr mager, sondern weich und mit kräftigen Brüsten. Szenenwechsel. Wir sind im Dachzimmer eines Hauses, das zu ihr gehört. Zwischen Balken sieht man hinauf in den sehr hohen Dachstuhl und in verschiedene Böden. Ich sage: "Da sieht man ja in Eure Bühne".

Ich lade ihn auf meinen leichten Wagen und setzte mich selber so, an die Vorderkante, dass ich ihn mit meinen Füssen wie ein Traberpferd sehr schnell und elegant bewegen kann. Unter Umfahren vieler Unebenheiten und Bodenweichheiten und Pfützen biege ich ins Lager ein, dass ich auf dem Umweg über eine Baracken-umsäumte Betonstrasse erreiche, während der General in eleganter Konversation mit meinen Kameraden über Autos und Automarken plaudert, wobei er jeweils nach der Marke eines am Rande stehenden Wagens fragt, die ich jedoch, der Technik unkundig, heimlich am Typenschild des Wagens ablesen muss. So bei einem Opel. -- Beim Einbiegen in das Lager werde ich von hochbeladenen Erntewagen mit schweren Pferden zum weiten Ausfahren des Bogens gedrängt, wobei die blondhaarigen Pferde beunruhigend mit mir sprechen, was ich nicht sehr verwunderlich finde, da ich mit meinem Dogcart ja selbst wie ein leichtes Traberpferd bin.

Doch wohnte jetzt hier Fräulein Röpnack, das alte Fräulein von gegenüber. Mich aber interessierte nur der geheimnisvoll verschlossene Eingang zur Bodentreppe, die ich gerne hinaufgestiegen wäre. Doch hielt unsere Emmi mich davon zurück. Szenenwechsel. Im Keller waren Männer, die mich mit einer kleinen Spritze nass spritzen wollten. Ich sollte dazu herunter kommen. Doch ich wartete damit so lange, bis die vielen Mädchen, die oben mit mir waren, mitkommen konnten. Dafür liessen wir bei einem Schneider kleine Dreieckshosen machen, die nur die Scham bedeckten und die Hüften freiliessen und mit schmalen Bändern überzogen, die an der Seite geknotet wurden. Der Schneider hatte sie nach meinen Angaben in verschiedenen Grössen angefertigt, und brachte sie meiner Begleiterin -- ich glaube, es war Emme, - mit den Worten: "Da haben Sie Ihre Kappen." Er hielt die Höschen für Trachtenkappen, hatte sie aber so genau angefertigt, dass sie alle wie angegossen sassen. Ich war sehr stolz auf dies Ergebnis. Szenenwechsel: Ich trug einen Bademantel, unter den ich nichts gezogen hatte, der aber schon alt und unansehnlich war. Mein Bruder erzählte mir, er habe in der Stadt einen sehr schicken Bademantel gesehen, den ich unbedingt haben müsse, und zog mich so schnell auf die Strasse, dass ich nicht einmal Zeit fand, meinen Bademantel zu schliessen. Während ich noch mit dem Zuknoten der Schnüre beschäftigt war, begegnete uns auf der Schwarzwaldstrasse die rot angezogene Tochter unseres Kaufmanns Schiller. Mein Bruder zog mich gerade hier über die Strasse, um den kürzesten Weg in die Stadt zu nehmen.

Die Haare des blonden Mädchens waren weich mit einem Goldschimmer und fielen leicht gespreizt wie auf einem alten Bild. Andere Szene: In einer der Villen der Querstrassen. Altmodische, etwas bombastisch angelegte Häuser mit grossen Treppengehäusen. Man scheint aus einer der Villen direkt in die andere kommen zu können. Der Vorplatz des Hauses ist von einem mächtigen Drahtgezäun wie ein Zwinger eingegrenzt, der mit einer elastischen Drahttür abgeschlossen wird, die wie eine Zieharmonika zusammenschiebbar ist, andererseits aber Figuren und Masse schmiedeeiserner Tore hat.

Der Wasserstrahl wird auf halbnackte Männer gespritzt, die in einem Boot auf dem Wasser schwimmen. Ein älterer Mann, der gerade vorbeikommt, bittet mich, für ihn in ein Kellerfenster hineinzurufen nach einer Nonne, die dort als Köchin wirkt, und die auch antwortet, als sie seinen Namen hört. Er hat sich vorgestellt mit dem Namen Johann und trägt einen ein wenig altmodisch steifen Hut mit kreisrunder Krempe, einen Stetson, und dazu einen Kneifer. Ich ging dann ein paar Häuser weiter, in ein Treppenhaus, um zu meinem Vater hinaufzusteigen, mit dem ich im obersten Stock wohnte. Doch wählte ich aus Versehen, die Treppe, die abwärts führte, in dem Glauben, sie würde mich hinaufführen. So sah ich mich gezwungen, umzukehren, gerade als auch Johann das Haus betrat, und traf ihn wieder. Ich fragte ihn, meiner ersten Eingebung folgend, ob er verwandt sei mit dem Schriftsteller A.E. Johann, der seine Weltreisen beschrieben habe und dessen Bücher, glaube ich, sehr gut seien. Er antwortete etwas zögernd: "Verwandt leider nicht -- aber ich bin Schriftsteller, - wenn Sie Lust haben, komme ich noch ein wenig zu Ihnen herauf, bis Ihr Herr Vater zurückkommt." Ich sagte: "Mein Vater ist jetzt immer zu Hause, aber kommen Sie doch ruhig trotzdem mit herauf." Johann hatte ursprünglich andere Leute in dem Haus besuchen wollen, zu denen er nun später gehen wollte. Mir war klar, dass er der bekannte Schriftsteller sein müsse, der unter dem Pseudonym A.E. Johann lebte, der, wie mir der Roggower Oertzen erzählte, eigentlich sein Vorname war. Ich erwachte darum mit dem Gedanken, ihn zu fragen, ob er den Roggower Oertzen kenne. (268 words)

Es war ein dunkler, etwas unwirtlicher Wiesengrund, wie nach der Schneeschmelze. -- Heidegger hatte meine Arbeit gelesen und sagte: "Ihr Kant-Kapitel erinnert mich an den und den", ein Buch das ich nicht kannte.

Andere Szene: Gisela hatte für zwei junge Mädchen, etwa im Alter von neun bis zwölf Jahren, zu sorgen. Man hatte sie in ihrer Abwesenheit getadelt. Ein altes Faktotum, etwa ein Gärtner, warnte sie und riet: "Dieses Bild würde ich ihnen raten fort zu stellen". Es war ein Bild auf ihrem Nachttisch, das eines der Mädchen nackt, bekleidet nur mit einem offenen Mantel zeigte, der die jungen kindlichen Brüste und die Scham freigab.

Leichen von deutschen Arbeitern wurden irgendwo im Süden unter keimendem Kaffee begraben. Ich beschriftete notdürftige Kreuze, wobei diese Worte vorkamen. Es war in einer Höhle.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1330 (1954-04-31 - Freiburg)Gang durch einen lange nicht mehr betretenen Stadtteil. Hier erinnert mich alles an Gisela. Andere Szene: Mit Emme in Hamburg. Ich zeige ihr von einer Mauer aus den Hafen, der in herrlicher Buntheit leuchtet. Ein Schiff fliegt fast über die Blauheit des Wassers, das sich in seiner Weite dehnt wie auf einem Bilde Kokoschkas. Die Mauer, an der wir lehnen, zieht sich an einer Stelle durch die Stadt, die nicht fern von unserer früheren Hamburger Wohnung in der Klosterallee ist, wo ich geboren bin. Alte Leute an der Mauer -- ich glaube, es ist ein Generalsehepaar, - versichern, meine Eltern gekannt zu haben. Sie geben allerdings eine andere Wohnung an, am Ende der Strasse, von der die Klosterallee abbiegt, sollen sie an dieser Ufermauer gewohnt haben. Andere Szene: Rechter Hand -- auch bei der Mauer, wir scheinen dort zu wohnen -- hat Emme ein Bordell entdeckt, und berichtet mir strahlend, dass sei etwas für mich. Sie sei dort hingegangen und habe mit den Weibern geschwätzt. Die wären zunächst entsetzt gewesen, dass eine Frau zu ihnen käme, aber sie hätte ihnen viel von mir erzählt und alles, was ich gern hätte und täte. Erwachen. (193 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1332 (1954-05-02 - Freiburg)Traum von Edward VIII und seiner Freundin. Der Traum hatte eine grosse Weiträumigkeit und fein abgestimmte Farbigkeit, aus der mir nur noch einzelne Bruchstücke geblieben sind. Ich war etwas wie sein Assistent und musste ihm die wichtigsten Dinge, alles was man zum Übersiedeln braucht -- wie Hausschuhe und Dinge, die zu seiner persönlichsten Sphäre gehörten, aus seinem Zimmer mitbringen. Er liess mir in der Auswahl alle Freiheit. Seine Freundin war von grossem Charme und grosser Reife. Sie hatte ein Stück Papier mit Buchstaben und Figuren bekritzelt -- von denen ich plötzlich, wie im Augenkneifen bemerkte, dass sie eine wunderbare Raumaufteilung geben. Das Bild blieb irgendwie in den Traum eingeprägt. Dann war da in der Umgebung der beiden ein Holzschnitt von Dorwarth. Er war schwarz-weiss, aber man sah ihn farbig: Segel auf einem blauen Fluss in Windungen durch ein Tal mit grünen Bergen. Das Bild war so ausgewogen, dass es allmählich zum Raum des Traumes wurde -- aber als Bild -- mit dem ich aufwachte. (164 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1333 (1954-05-04 - Freiburg)Zwei Bilder aus dem Winkel einer alten Stadt, die sich an dieser Stelle seit Jahrhunderten gleich geblieben ist. Es ist ein Winkel, den alte Handelshäuser um ein kleines Hafenbecken bilden, es ist ein sehr kleines quadratisches Becken, das durch ein riesiges Tor (in der Gestalt wie auf den Bilder Lukas Cranachs), das die Häuser fast an Höhe und Breite überragt, an einem Winkel zum Meer hin geöffnet und abgeschlossen ist. Das eine Bild stammt aus der Gegenwart, das andere aus der Zeit um 1700. Andere Szene: Ich bin in einer alten Stadt -- es ist wohl die selbe -- Anhalter fahrend von Norden nach Süden gelangt. Die Stadt muss irgendwo auf dem Wege von Kiel nach Freiburg liegen. Viele gotische Kirchen, ein wenig hanseatisch im Stil, und andere Kostbarkeiten, drängen sich zusammen. Ich versuche, so viel wie möglich in der Durchfahrt mit den Augen zu erhaschen, und zu erraten, wie die Stadt heisst. Auf einem alten und vielgiebligen gotischen Rathaus entdecke ich in verschlungenen und barocken Buchstaben die Inschrift: FORSTEMBERG, und weiss, dass ich in der Stadt Fürstenberg bin, deren Lage und Bedeutung mir im Traum ein Begriff sind. Es muss eine alte Stadt von grossem Rang und Einfluss sein, die irgendwo in der Ebene liegt. (206 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1334 (1954-05-04 - Freiburg)Dieser Drache (neben dem handschriftlichen Traum eine Zeichnung des Drachen) mit einer Haut wie ein aufgeblasenes Schwimmtier und von der Grösse etwa einer doppelten Handspanne, sass auf den Treppenstufen und flösste mir schauderndes Entsetzen ein. Dann fiel er noch die Stufen hinab und so in die Tür, dass ich diese nicht mehr vor ihm zuklappen konnte. Ihm war aber seine grosse Zunge in den geöffneten Mund zurückgefallen, so dass er langsam zu ersticken drohte. Dies zeigte sich daran, dass die glatte Gummihaut schrumpelig wurde, also dem Schwimmtier die aufgeblasene Luft knapp wurde. Jemand riet, ihm die Zunge aus dem Hals wieder herauszuziehen, doch ich war entsetzt bei dem Gedanken, ihn wieder lebendig werden zu sehen, und liess es, wenn er auch mit den aufgehalten Augen mich ein wenig wehmütig anschaute.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1336 (1954-05-15 - Freiburg)Erste Szene: Der Saarländer P. begleitet mich in ein Zimmer und haust dort mit mir. Er trägt dabei zugleich die Züge des Persers A. H.. -- Zweite Szene: Spaziergang mit Emme, während P. noch in meinem Zimmer ist. Ich sehe irgendwo in einem Geschäft einen Waschkorb mit Tongefässen, in denen ich ein wenig herumwühle. Ich zeige Emme verschiedene Gefässe, die besonders gelungen sind, und erkenne daran die Arbeit einer mir bekannten Töpferei, in der Ika einmal war. So sage ich zu Emme: "Hier haben sie jetzt hellere Glasuren." Die Verkäuferin, die merkt, dass es mich interessiert, zeigt mir eine glasierte Eierschale mit den Worten: "Hier haben wir etwas Besonderes." Die Schale ist schillernd glasiert, zerbricht mir aber unter den Fingern. Doch sehe ich an herumliegenden Bruchstücken, dass schon andere Schalen auf diese Weise zerbrochen sind. In diesem Moment ist die Meisterin da, die mich kennt (sie trägt ein wenig die Züge von Ikas Mutter), und die mich fragt, ob man in Volksdorf und Göttingen (Ikas beiden Töpfereien) etwas für mich getan habe (beruflich). Ich antworte: "Nein."- Andere Szene: Ein goldener Teller, auf dessen Rand ich einen Spruch eingraviert sehe. Beim Entziffern merke ich, dass der Satz von mir stammt. Ich habe ihn in der Jugend geschrieben bei der Lektüre einer Abhandlung von Hegel. Der Satz ist im Stile Hegels oder Heideggers auf den ersten Blick schwer verständlich und so, dass er die normalen Subjekte und Prädikate auf den Kopf stellt, indem er sie in ihrer Bedeutung vertieft. Doch ist der Satz ohne diese Einsicht unsinnig. Und so lesen und kritisieren ihn mein Vater und meine Schwester. Ich versuche, ihnen den Satz deutlich zu machen, doch werde ich immer wieder belehrt, dass er Unsinn sei. Ich spreche wie gegen taube Ohren. Andere Szene: (Die wahrscheinlich hier, vielleicht auch später folgt): Meine Schwester trägt ein Bikinihöschen, das nicht richtig sitzt. Es ist aus gekräuseltem Lastex. Ich sage: "Du musst es vorne etwas tiefer ziehen, dann kommt es hinten höher und sitzt", und ziehe ihr das Höschen zurecht. Dann schlage ich ihr vor, zu P. zu gehen, der unbedingt ins Bett wolle, und der sowieso böse ist, dass er als Gast so lange allein gelassen wurde. Andere Szene: Ich wohne in Heideggers Haus, einem alten Landhaus mit starken Mauern und quadratischen Räumen, wo ich auf ein Gespräch über meine Arbeit warte. Doch ich geniesse schon Monate lang die Gastfreundschaft, ohne dass je ein Wort über die Arbeit gefallen wäre. Heidegger sagt gerade: "Heute kommt Herr von Vieregge aus Steinhausen, das ist ein angenehmer Gast, er ist so ruhig und gemütlich." Dann erscheint Vieregge, und Heidegger empfängt ihn mit den Worten: "Ich habe gerade noch etwas zu tun, magst Du so lange hier noch etwas abstauben." Und Vieregge ergreift gemütlich das Staubtuch, um in aller Ruhe den alten quadratischen Raum abzustauben, in dessen Fensternischen man die Wände des starken Steinhauses gut erkennt. Ich denke: So muss man zu Heidegger sein, dann bekommt man einen wirklichen Kontakt. Man muss nur nichts von ihm wollen. Andere Szene: Vor der Tür. Ein mächtiger Lastwagen mit zwei Anhängern fährt vor, und ich erinnere mich, dass diese Szene schon genauso war, als ich kam vor langem und meine Arbeit Heidegger brachte. Es ist wie in einem Traum, der serienweise immer wiederkehrt: Die Anhänger werden los geschaltet und der eine läuft mit einem mächtigen Wumm gegen ein altes Bohlentor. Diese Szene scheint etwas Magisches zu haben (mir ist im Traum dabei sehr deutlich, dass sie mich an Früheres und an frühere Träume erinnert, aber nicht so, dass ich den gegenwärtigen Traum dabei auch als Traum erleben würde. Nur die Bezogenheit des Erlebnisses auf Früheres und frühere Träume. (607 words)

Steuerrad und Gangschaltung waren versenkt. Ich musste alles durch Umdrehen des Zündschlüssels erst herausholen. Dies ging dann über in eine Fahrt im Panzer. Ich endete bei einem alten leer stehenden und höhlenartigen Haus. Doch waren Leute da -- zunächst ein Mann auf der Leiter. Es kommt zu einer handfesten Auseinandersetzung. Komplizen, wie P., kommen dazu. Doch gelingt es mir, den Frieden herzustellen. Es ist ein wenig Wildwest. (102 words)

Eine tief dunkle Granatkette in vielen Bändern, wie Emmes Halskette, lege ich mir -- wie im Spiel -- um den Hals. Sie reicht mehrfach herum, doch bleibt ein Stückchen der Länge übrig, so dass ich es mit dem Daumen halten muss, anstatt nur das Schloss zu schliessen. Während der Ordenszeremonie spüre ich eine Fülle von ausgefallenen Zähnen in meinem Mund, deren Menge ständig wächst, wie wenn einem alle Milchzähne auf einmal ausgefallen wären. Ich spucke sie über das Geländer (wohl einer Brücke). (122 words)

Plötzlich geht mir auf, dass ich mir das sparen kann, da ich ja die Ausgangssperre schon passiert habe. Es ist ein altes Schloss am Berghang, in dem oft Singfeste abgehalten werden, weil es vor den Bergen eine wunderbare Akustik hat. Ich begreife dies beim Anblick des alten grauen Steinbaus vor den mächtigen grünen Waldhängen. -- Dann plötzlich entschwindet das Bild hinter Ruinen einer ausgebombten Stadt, die den Weg erschweren. Doch bald erkenne ich die Gegend. Ich folge mit einigen Begleitern ausgetretenen Pfaden durch die Ruinenfeldern, die zum Schloss führen. Szenenwechsel: Ich bin in Wittmoldt und höre an einem Morgen, wie Mölöchen, sich über meine Gegenwart bei Mix beschwert. Ich gehe hinein und treffe Dolo weinend. "Mölöchen hat gesagt: es muss alles anders werden". Ich sage: "Warum hat sie mich denn überhaupt eingeladen?" Dolo antwortet: "Sie hat doch kein Geld".

Doch als wir den Raum -- im Parterre eines Schul- oder Universitätsgebäudes, in den eine Tür von aussen führt -- geöffnet haben, entdecken wir eine Unmenge von Studenten, die sich von innen durch eine geöffnete Tür hineindrängen. Einige der Seminarmitglieder versuchen, die Menge aus der Tür zurückzudrängen, um diese zu schliessen, doch Heidegger, der das Gedränge schon von ferne sieht, lächelt nur listig, steuert auf eine abgelegene Bibliothek im gegenüberliegenden Gebäude zu und gibt uns einen Wink, ihm zu folgen. Ich schliesse als letzter sorgfältig die Tür ab. Er zeigt uns alte Bücher oder Handschriften in grossem Format. Es ist eine sehr esoterische Atmosphäre. -- Andere Szene, in die die alte Räumlichkeit irgendwie eingeht, spielt in Klosetts. Ein Mädchen, das wie ein Mann angezogen ist, auch Hosen trägt, geht auf ein Männerklo. Ich staune, wie sie das macht. Szenenwechsel: Die Grossherzogin fährt mit einem Staatsklo -- wie in einem goldenen Krönungswagen -- durch die Strassen. Es ist ein sehr feierlicher, zeremonieller Akt. -- Erwachen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1349 (1954-06-01 - Freiburg)Ich ging mit den gefüllten Nachttopf mitten über die Strasse und suchte ein Klo, ihn auszuleeren. Schliesslich fand ich ein klassizistisches Haus, von dem mir Yoie einmal gesagt hatte, dass sie dort aufs Klo ginge. Es war ein Haus mit einem extra Dienstboteneingang und noch einer dritten Türe, von der ich annahm, dass sie in das Klo führen müsse. Sie wurde gerade von dem Herrn des Hauses geöffnet, der sie hinauskommend hinter sich schliessen und den Schlüssel abziehen wollte. Ich sagte, möglichst selbstverständlich: "Entschuldigen Sie", nahm ihm die Tür aus der Hand und verschwand mit meinem Topf im Klo. Er sagte nur: "Sie müssen dann den Schlüssel zurückhängen." Wie ein Nachtwandler fand ich dann auch für diesen den Platz, einen Nagel hinter der Eingangstür, musste nun mit dem leeren Topf durch die Strassen zurück, den die Leute wieder kaum bemerkten. -- In einer anderen Szene wiederholte sich derselbe Gang mit einem Staubsauger. Ein kleiner Junge war bei mir, der einen zweiten Staubsauger hatte. Doch war der Weg jetzt lang und grossstädtisch, führte über eine verkehrsreiche Brücke und durch einen Tunnel unter einem grossen Bahnhof durch. Stadtlandschaft wie in Hamburg, etwa am Damtor. Schliesslich standen uns auf dem grossen Platz vor dem Bahnhof eine Menge alter Soldaten in Zivil im Wege, die mit ihren Unteroffizieren getrunken hatten und nun betrunken versuchten, in kleinen Kolonnen abzumarschieren, dabei aber immer in Kreisbewungen gelangten, in die man unfehlbar hineingeriet. Es war sehr komisch. Wir blieben einfach stehen und liessen sie wie Wasser an uns vorbeifliessen. Dann kam noch ein kleines Auto, ein eleganter Porsche, der sich unbedingt durch das Gewühl den Weg bahnen wollte. Ich stellte mich ihm in den Weg, wurde aber von ihm ignoriert. So ergriff ich hinter einem Griff die Karosserie, die sich im Weiterfahren wie eine Haut von dem Wagen abzog und vor mir lang ausgezogen auf der Strasse lag, so dass der Fahrer im Freien sass.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1350 (1954-06-03 - Freiburg)Träume von André Lot und Bender. Zunächst ein Teller, den André Lothe für uns gemacht hat, er zeigt zwei Wappen, die quadratisch in die runde Form eingelassen sind und dabei in Lotscher Weise das Heraldische ganz in Farbflächen aufgelöst, die eine gleichmässige Aufteilung des Quadrats ergeben. Links das Uslarsche Wappen. Rechts ein anderes. Doch sind die Wappenfarben schwarz-weiss-rot leicht gebrochen, so dass das Schwarz zum Blau wird. Das zweite Wappen hat vor allem Gelb. Die Flächen sind in Quadrate geteilt und durch angedeutete Diagonalen gegliedert. Wir, Emme und ich, entdecken auch Lots Unterschrift unter dem Bild, das unter Glas in den Teller eingelassen scheint. Die beiden quadratischen Wappenflächen ergeben zusammen ein Rechteck im Kreis des Tellers. -- Zweite Szene: Bender bekommt von einem Mädchen eine grosse Traumserie in Aussicht gestellt. Er sagt: "Gut, schreiben Sie sie einmal ab", dann ändert er seinen Plan und sagt: "oder geben sie Sie mir, ich lasse dann jeden Tag einen abschreiben." Ich merke, dass er mir die Serien zugedacht hat, die ich mir auf diese Weise abschreibend bequem aneignen kann, so dass ich nicht nur auf mein eigenes Material für meine Traumarbeit angewiesen bin. -- Im Erwachen Überlegung, dass die Traumserie, also etwa 400 bis 500 Träume enthalten muss, gleichzeitig aber das Gefühl, es seien über 1000.

H. verschlungen eingraviert sind. Ich weiss, dass die Buchstaben v. H. den Namen des ersten Mannes meiner Mutter, v. Haase, bedeuten, der sich noch in den Monogrammen mancher unserer Bettwäschestücke fand, meist oberflächlich in v. U. abgeändert, indem der H-Balken herabgesetzt war. Zum G. jedoch kann ich im Traum keinen Bezug herstellen. Dann von einem Ring, den mein Vater unserer Emmi geschenkt hat -- es ist in der Kriegszeit, nach dem Tode meiner Mutter, in der mein Vater manchmal einzelne Schmuckstücke unserer Emmi als Aufmerksamkeit schenkte. In der schmalen Fassung dieses Ringes war ein kleiner bernsteinfarbener Stein, den unsere Emmi auskochte, wobei er in tausend kleine Stücke zersprang. Sie hatte diese Möglichkeit wohl nicht bedacht.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1352 (1954-06-09 - Freiburg)Zwei Männer leben seit endlosen Zeiten eingeschlossen in einer Höhle, tief in der Erde. Sie brauchen nichts zu essen. Plötzlich hört man neben der Höhle Geräusche im Erdinnern und Stimmen. Die beiden Männer schreien vor Freude auf, dass sie endlich befreit werden. Man hört die Stimmen drüben, die nun das Rufen gehört haben, sagen: "Das sind Deutsche, Germanen". Dann sieht man auch schon einen nackten Fuss durch die Wand der Höhlung hineinbrechen und bald darauf zwei Männer durch das grösser gewordene Loch eintreten: Es sind Dante und Virgil, die auf ihrer Wanderung, ihrem Abstieg durch den Höllentrichter, zufällig an jener Höhle im Erdinnern vorbeigekommen sind, die sich gerade neben jenem Trichter befand. Vorher andere Traumszene: Die Hauswand war nicht nur im Keller (was im Augenblick wegen eines Umbaus tatsächlich der Fall ist), sondern in der ganzen Höhe bis zu meinem "Käfig" unter dem Dachstuhl hinauf eingebrochen und dabei die hochgezogene Mauer etwa um einen Meter zurückgesetzt, so dass der Käfig gleichsam in der Luft schwebte, gehalten nur durch zwei an der Mauer gleichsam angeklebte Holzhäuschenkonstruktionen, die untere ein wenig weiter zurückfliehend als die obere, doch auch diese den Vorsprung meines "Käfigs" nicht ganz erreichend. Doch war in meinem Traum nur die halbe Vorderwand unseres Hauses eingerissen und zurückgesetzt, und zwar gerade die Hälfte, über der sich der Käfig befindet. Die andere Hälfte war belassen, doch sah man jetzt, dass sie infolge der Bombenschäden des Hauses aus dem Kriege, stark nach vorne geneigt war. (243 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1353 (1954-06-11 - Freiburg)Nicolai Hartmann hielt einen Vortrag über die Person und sagte: "Innerlich ist sie eine Ganzheit, aber von aussen nicht." Auch die Zeitlichkeit spielte in seine Erklärung herein und war nach Innen und Aussen verschieden aufgefasst. -- Ich antwortete, mir sei dies alles sehr verständlich, er habe das ja auch in seinen Büchern geschrieben, schloss dann aber mit dem Satz: "....aber was heisst Innen und Aussen?" Hartmann war erzürnt über diese Frage und wollte sie als überflüssig verbieten. Ich sagte: "Wenn Sie diese Frage verbieten, schneiden Sie alles philosophische Fragen ab. Das Ich ist doch kein Käfig, in dem es drinnen sitzt." Dann tauchte Heidegger in dem Traum auf, oder sein Name, jedenfalls hatte ich im Wachen die Erinnerung von Hartmann und Heidegger geträumt zu haben. (125 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1354 (1954-06-11 - Freiburg)Emme und ich hatten ein grosses offenes Auto. Wir standen davor -- es war wohl ein Zweisitzer -- und der Wagen begann, sich selbsttätig zu bewegen, und drohte, langsam gegen eine Mauer zu fahren. Ich kletterte, von hinten oder vorne -- jedenfalls nicht durch die Tür --, in den Wagen hinein und trat auf alle Fusshebel, die ich noch sehr deutlich vor mir sehe, um so auf jeden Fall auch die Bremse zu treffen. Bei dem ersten Hebel, den ich traf, in der Hoffnung, es sei die Bremse, hatte ich nämlich das Gefühl, es könne auch der Gashebel sein. Schliesslich -- der Wagen war zum Stehen gekommen -- sahen wir Rauch aus der linken Vorderecke des Wageninnenraums aufsteigen. Ich entdeckte das Feuer und fürchtete eine Explosion. Emme reichte mir ein Handlöschgerät. Doch wussten wir nicht, wie es zu bedienen war. (140 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1355 (1954-06-15 - Freiburg)Ika besucht uns -- Emme und mich --, oder wir sie. Sie hat eine Menge Zeichnungen -- vor allem Köpfe, die interessant sind. Zum Teil arabesk aufgelöst, in fast buchstabenhafte Formen. Es sind alles Versuche. Sie selbst ist -- wie oft -- skeptisch. Auch ein Kopf mit einem sehr schönen Rücken, der dem meinen gleicht. Unter den Zeichnungen liegen Reproduktionen von Bildern von Michelangelo. So scheint einmal ein Bein hervor (das an den Propheten Joel aus der Sixtina erinnert, wie mir erst jetzt, im Wachen, auffällt). Ika beschäftigt sich auch mit jüdischer Geschichte, worüber wir sprechen. Die Pädagogen hätten diese Lücken in der Beschäftigung gemerkt und sich vor allem diesem Studium zugewandt. Emme räumt während unseres Gesprächs im Nachbarzimmer. Vorher andere Szene: Ich habe verschiedene Zeichnungen von mir an Türen geheftet. Später nehme ich sie wieder ab, weil sie mir nicht mehr gefallen (von da Übergang zu der Szene mit Ika). Zugleich spielte diese Szene auch in einem Bahnhofsgelände, Züge fahren vorbei, und vor Frau Roguszkas Tür. Mit dieser Gespräch über einen Lappen, mit dem man die Teekanne abwischen kann. Ich entdecke einen, der bisher nur mit Tee in Berührung gekommen ist und ganz aromatisch nach Tee riecht. Er hat die Form einer Teemütze oder eines Waschlappens -- taschenhaft. Ich hänge ihn an einen Nagel, wo er Frau Roguszka und mir zugänglich ist. Die Räumlichkeit des Ganges vor Frau Roguszkas Tür ist zugleich mit der des Bahnhofs identisch, wo es eine Art Strasse ist, die die Gleiskörper überquert, doch sind dazwischen die Wände -- Holzwände mit den Nägeln an denen Lappen hängen, und später auch die Holztüren mit meinen Zeichnungen. Von da -- wohl durch diese Türen -- geht es dann direkt in die Szene mit Ika, wo ihre Zeichnungen auf dem -- glaube ich, runden -- Tisch liegen. Die jüdische Geschichte spielt eine wichtige Rolle. Mir leuchtet das Charakteristische dieser ausgewählten Beschäftigung für Ika ein. (316 words)

Sagt dann: "Vielleicht geht es auch bei Euch -- bei Euch sind die Haare ja breiter" -- mit diesen Sätzen auf die Schamhaare anspielend, zieht sie mir langsam die Kleider von der Scham und betastet das sich aufrichtende Glied.

Auch ihr Mann, der Urgrossvater, war ganz jung auf dem Bild -- doch von derselben Eleganz wie auf dem Altersbild, von dem ich Emme bei der Gelegenheit erzählte. Andere Szene: Ein neuer Staubsauger, den ein Vertreter vorführt. Ein gewaltige Apparatur mit urtierhafter Schnauze -- ähnlich wie grosse amerikanische Autos -- und hinter sich herziehend noch ein Gestell aus Rädern, die Scheinwerfer und Beleuchtungskörper trugen, um die Szene zu beleuchten.

Der Karton schien mir bedeutsam im Erwachen. Andere Szene: Gymnastinnen oder Atemlehrerinnen wollen zeigen, wie man einen Hypnotisierten oder Ohnmächtigen wieder zum Atmen bringt. Ich stelle mich für eine Demonstration zur Verfügung. Die Wirkung wird durch eine scheinbar unscheinbare Massage der unteren Bauchgegend erreicht, durch ein leichtes rhythmisches Eindrücken, das den Atemrhythmus unwillkürlich anspringen lässt. Ich stelle mich erstarrt, indem ich die Zunge in den Hals zurückfallen lasse und den Nacken starr mache. Doch will es mir nicht gelingen, diese Pose, die ja einen unwillkürlichen Zustand nachmachen soll, aus dem die Massage erst allmählich befreit, - noch während der Massage durchzuhalten. (130 words)

So wissen wir nicht, was wir vor uns haben und wo noch eigene Truppen sind. Wir passieren einen Mann in schlichter weisser Uniform. Es muss ein höherer Offizier, wohl Regimentskommandeur, sein. Szilasi will die Situation retten und schickt mich darum mit dem Mann vor in eine Lichtung (denn auf Rangunterschiede kommt es jetzt nicht mehr an). Vor uns liegt eine Lichtung. Rechts und links Wald. Doch stellt der Mann die Frage: "Wissen Sie überhaupt, was da noch vor uns ist?" -- Dann sehen wir sehr still und vorsichtig - gleichsam unbeirrbar tastend -- graue Gestalten auf uns zukommen. Die Russen greifen an. Es bleibt nur die Möglichkeit der Flucht, da hier die Front eine Lücke hat, und überhaupt der Rückzugskrieg nur noch die Verwirklichung dieser Möglichkeit ist. Wir müssen aus letzter Kraft laufen. Trotzdem weiss ich, dass ich es aus mir allein nicht schaffen werde, doch gibt mir der Mann, der in seiner schlichten Gesammeltheit jetzt sehr väterlich ist, seine Hand und zieht mich hinter sich her. -- Wir warnen einige entgegenkommende Leute und Wagen, die glauben, dass noch eine Truppe vor ihnen sei, und geradewegs in den Feind hineinfahren würden. Die Situation des Fliehens setzt sich dann durch mehrere Szenen fort. In einem Haus, in das ich noch einmal zurückkehre, sammle ich alle meine Brieftaschen, die ich je einmal gehabt habe und die ich dort finde. Es sind die glatte, lederne, die Emme mir geschenkt hat und deren Leder ich sehr liebe. Dann die von Manuela von Kirchbach (der Schwester meines Grossvaters), die ich als Kind bei mir trug und wegen ihres glatten starken Leders liebte, und noch eine dritte. -- So war ich auf meiner Flucht nur mit diesen drei Brieftaschen beladen, die ich in die Hand presste. In einer anderen Szene geriet ich in dem Vorgelände einer Stadt in eine Sackgasse, die durch Bauarbeiten entstanden war. Ich musste nach links auf die Strasse zurück. Doch führte der einzige Weg über einen hohen Zaun, wie mir ein Mann zurief, der oben auf Brettern stand, die sehr schwankend waren. Das rief ich ihm zu, doch war er sorglos. Einige Bretter kamen ins Übergewicht und stürzten, und ich sah ihn schon in Gedanken aus der grossen Höhe herabfallen und unten zerschmettert werden. Die Vorstellung befiel mich lähmend, so dass ich noch fast bewegungslos am Boden lag, während die Bretter dicht neben mir aufschlugen, während es dem Mann gelungen war, durch einige rudernde Bewegungen das Gleichgewicht zu wahren und seinen Füssen oben Halt zu verschaffen. -- Ich kletterte dann wahrscheinlich hinauf. Hier brach die Szene ab. Jedenfalls lag eine Schwierigkeit darin, dass ich einen gefüllten Milchtopf mit hinauf balancieren wollte. In einer anderen Szene war ich mit einem guten Kameraden in einer Stadt an der Front, die geräumt werden musste. Es war immer noch die Flucht, und wir hatten wenig Chancen, den einholenden Truppen der Russen noch zu entrinnen. Doch war der Freund bereit, mich zu begleiten, obwohl er allein schneller gewesen wäre, denn er hatte -- wie die anderen -- ein Fahrrad. Da erschien plötzlich ein Chauffeur -- in noch sehr exakter Kleidung -- fragte: "Wohnt hier Herr v. Uslar?" (ich war nicht Militär). Ich bejahte und sagte, dass ich es sei. Er erwiderte: "Darf ich Sie bitten, in meinem Wagen mitzufahren". Ich dankte und bat, auch den anderen Mann mitzunehmen -- doch merkte, dass schon dieser nicht auf diese Möglichkeit reflektierte, ohne jedoch traurig zu sein, sondern sich in einer gewissen Heiterkeit auf sich selbst verlassend und sein Fahrrad, der Chauffeur aber diese Möglichkeit brüsk ablehnte. Plötzlich ging mir auf, dass er und alle meine Freunde dort in dem Haus Juden waren, in deren Ghetto gleichsam ich gelebt hatte. Sie erhielten nicht nur die Hilfe der anderen nicht, sondern wollten sie auch gar nicht. Ich war gerührt durch diese Situation und folgte dann dem Chauffeur, der mich in einen alten, einst sehr repräsentativen Wagen führte, wie ihn zuweilen noch Fürsten oder Staatsoberhäupter fahren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1362 (1954-06-21 - Freiburg)Ich stehe oben auf einer Leiter oder Brettern, gerüstartig -- und verliere das Gleichgewicht, stürze herab. Doch gelingt es mir, die Säule eines benachbarten Fensters -- das durch diese Senkrechte geteilt ist -- zu ergreifen und durch das Fenster in den Raum hineinzuschwingen. Drinnen ist kein Mensch, sondern nur ein Hund, der sofort seine Wachfunktion ergreift und mich anspringt. Er wird mir dabei bedrohlich, und zwar droht der Biss meinem Kopf. Ich halte ihn wie ein Kind auf dem Arm (die Erinnerung ist hier undeutlich) und versuche, ihn abwerfend, durch die Tür zu entweichen und diese zu schliessen, ehe der Hund mir folgen kann. Doch gerät immer wieder eine Pfote des Hundes in die Tür, und ich scheue mich, ihn einzuklemmen. (121 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1365 (1954-06-26 - Freiburg)Begegnung mit Churchill auf der Strasse. Er geht hier als Bürger dieser Stadt spazieren. Ich überlege, ob ich ihn grüssen soll, denn es kommt mir komisch vor, einen Mann nicht zu grüssen, der einem so vertraut ist. Doch überlegte ich mir, dass so ja alle Menschen zu ihm stünden, er aber mich nicht kenne. So nickte ich ihm nur leise zu und beobachtete ihn scharf, konnte aber hinter seiner Sonnenbrille keine Reaktion seines Blickes feststellen. Andere Szene: Auf dem Klo in einem psychologischen Institut, das mit Heiss zusammenhängt. Eine alte, etwas spiessige Frau öffnet die Tür und schliesst sie zwar wieder, macht sich aber an ihr zu schaffen und bringt einen Vorhang an, wofür sie zuweilen sie öffnen muss. (119 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1367 (1954-07-04 - Freiburg)Ich höre im Radio eine wunderbare Barockmusik, die zugleich wie eine der grossen heiteren Suiten, Balettmusik und Chorwerk ist, und sinne darüber nach, von welchem Komponisten sie ist, da ich sie schon einmal gehört habe. T.W. (mein Bruder) und Emmi, die beide im Zimmer sind (Räumlichkeit wie zu Hause in Schwerin im Zimmer meiner Mutter) wollen das Radio leiser oder abstellen, so dass es mir nicht möglich ist, diese Musik, in deren Heiterkeit ich wie in meinem Element bin, richtig zu hören. Ich verlasse voll Zorn das Zimmer und gehe in mein Zimmer, wo Emmes kleiner Philipps steht, um dort weiter zu hören. Zu meinem Erstaunen folgen mir beide. Die Sendung wird von einem nahen Berg ausgestrahlt. Ich höre dabei die Fanfaren direkt von dem Berg, die der Musik, die im übrigen aus dem Radio kommt, eine ungeheure Festlichkeit geben. Die Baumgärtnerin erklärt mir den Ort der Ausstrahlung in einer Berg- und Waldlandschaft (die der hiesigen gleicht, aber anders ist als der weite, wirkliche Blick aus unserem Fenster). Sie erklärt den Weg. Häuser. Hinter dem Waldstück eine Kirche. Dort am Bahnübergang ein Haus, wo sie immer ihr Rad abstellt, wenn sie in den Wald geht. Dort wäre es, ich könne sie ja -- dort hingehend -- bei der Gelegenheit gleich abholen, wenn sie aus dem Wald zurückkomme. (Hier folgt im handschriftlichen Manuskript mit der Überschrift "Blick aus dem Fenster" eine Zeichnung, auf der man die Kirche sieht und das Sendehaus, einen roten Baukörper, und weitere Häuser, ferner eine Eisenbahnlinie, die den Weg überquert und Zeichen, die die Bäume des Waldes andeuten). Andere Szene, bei Festhalten derselben Atmosphäre: Frau Roguszka (unsere Wohnungsnachbarin) hat einen Weinschaumkuchen gebacken, der hoch aufragend wie ein Baumkuchen ist. Sie gibt mir ein Exemplar, doch fällt es auf dem Teller um, und hat darauf keinen Platz. Das herausragende Stück droht abzubrechen. Ich schiebe ein grosses hölzernes Brotbrett unter. Der Kuchen, der schaumig ist, wird im Erkalten fest und von der Struktur wie eine Fruchtroulade. Ich esse. Er schmeckt sehr gut. Erwachen. Nach dem Erwachen verspüre ich Hunger nach dem Kuchen und bin zugleich noch ganz erfüllt von der Heiterkeit der Barockmusik. (354 words)

Heuss hatte drei Füsse, mit denen er sich sehr elegant bewegte. Andere Szene: Frau Heuss war alt und musste sich auf mich stützen. Eine Menge von Bittstellerinnen hatte sich um sie versammelt, die sie aber nicht alle anhören konnte. Es waren alles etwas larmoyante und ein wenig übertünchte Frauen. -- Nur eine wollte sie anhören -- mit dunkelbraunen Haaren - die sich vorhin gemeldet hatte. Ich sollte sie aus der Menge rauskennen, doch glich eine der anderen. Alle waren gleichsam normiert und bedeutungslos. (125 words)

Emme stand dicht vor mir und sagte: "Warum willst Du jeden Gegensatz gleich auslöschen, wir haben doch ein ganzes gemeinsames Leben vor uns, um ihn zu überwinden". Ich antwortete: "Wir können ja morgen sterben. Das kannst Du ja gar nicht wissen". In der Dämonie der Begegnung hatte Emme hier eine grosse Verwandtschaft, fast Identität mit Gisela. Die Dämonie dieses Traums hielt sich auch im Erwachen noch durch. Andere Traumszene: Fasching. Emme, die mitmachen möchte -- aber sich wegen des Geredes der Leute nicht ganz traut -- sagt: "Aber die engen Hosen ziehe ich nicht an" - , obwohl sie weiss, dass gerade die ihr jetzt mit dem Baby am besten stehen, aber am meisten Anstoss erregen. Ich sage: "Natürlich ziehst Du auch zum Tanzen die Hosen an, wo sie doch so viel netter aussehen". (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1371 (1954-07-18 - Freiburg)Der Hof hinter dem umgebauten Haus wird neu aufgeteilt, und zwar sind eigene kleine Höfe geschaffen, einer rechts des Hauses und hinter der Terrasse für die neuen Besitzer. Links, weiter abbiegend, ein Hof für die Baumgärtnerin und einer für Professor Bultmann, den Vater von Gesine (hier folgt im handschriftlichen Manuskript eine Zeichnung, in der man das Haus sieht und die verschiedenen Höfe, die beschriftet sind als Hof der Besitzer, Hof Baumgarten, Hof Bultmann). In einer nächsten Szene ist der eine Hof wohnlich wie ein Zimmer geworden. Ich habe dort -- im Freien, es ist warm -- meinen Waschtisch stehen, wo ich mich wasche. Auch Professor Krückmann will sich dort waschen. Ich weise ihn auf andere Möglichkeiten im geschlossenen Haus hin, doch er zieht meine improvisierte vor. Dann wandelt sich die Szene des Hofes zu der Geräumigkeit eines ganzes Dorfes. Hinter dem Haus ist eine Art Terrasse aus Lorenschienen. Ich höre es über mir grummeln und denke zunächst, die Loren seien losgeworden und könnten auf mich herabstürzen. Dann aber entdecke ich riesige Flugzeuge dicht über mir im Gleit- und Sturzflug. Ich laufe und versuche, Deckung zu nehmen. Es ist mir unklar, ob sie angreifen wollen. Eine Katastrophe scheint bevorzustehen. Eines nach dem anderen setzt im Gleitflug vor und neben mir zu einer Bauchlandung an, einige stürzen mit der Nase herab und gehen glühend und prasselnd in Flammen auf, andere gleiten mit dem mächtigen walfischartigen Rumpf über dem Boden auf mich zu, eines nach dem anderen. Keines hat ein Fahrgestelll ausfahren können. Ich kann nicht mehr fliehen. Presse mich fest auf den Boden. Die riesigen Rümpfe gleiten über mich hinweg. Eine flache, kaum merkbare Bodenmulde scheint mich zu schützen. Ich sehe grosse schwarze und gleicharmige Kreuze als Hoheitsabzeichen. Als endlich der letzte Rumpf mich überglitten hat, springe ich auf, um zu fliehen. Es ist jetzt höchste Gefahr, denn überall liegen brennende Rümpfe, die explodieren können. Andere sind noch unversehrt, wieder andere, an denen ich vorbeikomme, zeigen einen glühenden Metallrumpf, wie ein Gerippe in einem Meer von gelben Flammen und Glut. Ich warne Kinder, die mir aus dem Dorf entgegenkommen, und fliehe nach Süden. Bei alledem habe ich die kleine blaue Tonschale in der Hand, die Ika gemacht hat -- doch besteht zugleich im Traum eine starke Beziehung zu Gisela und im Erwachen gleichzeitig -- in einer Identität -- zu Emme, die in einer warmen Geborgenheit mit mir im Zimmer in ihrem Bett liegt. Draussen braust ein sturmartiger fiebrig warmer Föhn, in dem ich sofort die ganze Szenerie des Traumes wiedererkenne. Das Wiedererkennen beeindruckt mich tief. (423 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1372 (1954-07-20 - Freiburg)Ich habe eine furchtbare Wut. Um mich abzureagieren, schlage ich mit dem Hammer einen Nagel in den Fussboden. Andere Szene: Mein Vater und mein Bruder sind in einem wütenden Streit begriffen. Ich finde sie im Ankleidezimmer (in Schwerin) vor Wut auf dem Fussboden kriechen. Ich trete dazwischen -- mit erhobenen Armen -- und gebiete Ruhe. Sie sind so erschrocken, dass sie mir folgen. Andere Szene: Ich bin zum Geldverdienen auf dem Lande auf einem Hofe in der Nähe der Stadt, wo ich etwas eingekauft habe. Ich habe -- aus eigener Vollmacht -- einen Sack Häcksel gekauft für das Tier und eine Rübe. Mit beidem fahre ich jetzt heim -- sehr müde, alles auf dem Fahrrad balancierend, wobei ich einen Schutzmann im grossen Kreis umlenken muss -- meine Bremsen funktionieren nur schlecht, und vorne und hinten kommen die Autos. Doch gelingt es mir, durch alles richtig durchzulavieren. Nur einen Ochsenwagen, der entgegenkam, hätte ich fast angefahren, doch er biegt in die selbe ländliche Seitenstrasse ein wie ich.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1373 (1954-07-23 - Freiburg)Bei Nacht in Schwerin durch die Schloss-Strasse. Dort, wo bei den Schinkel'schen Bauten die Bürgersteige noch sehr breit sind. Ich schlendere dicht an den Quadermauern der ausladenden klassizistischen Gebäude entlang. Die Strasse ist bevölkert von sehr eleganten Freudenmädchen, die wohl aus den Gebäuden kommen, in denen früher die Regierung, später Besatzungskommandaturen waren. Es liegt etwas Unheimliches über den Bürgersteigen. Ich gehe den Winkel an den Mauern, dort, wo die Strasse wieder enger wird, ganz exakt aus, wie in einer gewissen Schlaftrunkenheit, in der man den Gang an den Mauern anlehnt -- und ich weiss, dass ich jetzt nicht rechts in die Gassen einbiegen darf, die schliesslich zum Grossen und zum Kleinen Moor führen (alten kopfsteingepflasterten Strassen), die winklig sind und unheimlich. (Erwachen. Erneutes Einschlafen). Nächste Szene: Ich komme vom Schlossgarten (wo unsere Wohnung war), über die beiden Schlossbrücken in die Stadt -- das heisst: ich bin schon den ganzen Weg von der Cäcilienallee her in einem merkwürdigen Geschwindigkeitsrausch gelaufen, mit einem aufgespannten Regenschirm in der Hand den letzten Berg in der Cäcilienallee zum Greenhouse herab -- gleichsam getrieben -- wie auf einem Fahrrad, das mit sehr grosser Geschwindigkeit den Berg herabrollt -- so dass ich, aber zu Fuss immer nur im letzten Moment, aber wie im Rausch, den Passanten ausweichen konnte, dabei den aufgespannten Regenschirm über sie in die Höhe haltend. -- Später, hinter dem Greenhouse, auf dem "Tugendpfad"(einem Abkürzungsweg durch die feuchten Uferwiesen) hatte ich dann den Schirm zusammengeklappt und jagte weiter. In diesem merkwürdigen Zustand passierte ich nun die zweite Schlossbrücke. Eine Frau sagte hinter mir zu ihrer Begleitung: "Was ist das für ein komischer Mann" und andere Bemerkungen, die so laut waren, dass man sie auf der ganzen Brücke hören konnte. Ich hielt meinen Lauf an, kehrte um, ging schnurstracks auf sie zu, stellte sie zur Rede und sagte: "Sind Sie immer so unhöflich. Sie sehen ja durchaus etwas komisch aus". Sie war sehr dick, hatte ein sackartiges dunkles Gewand an, einen altmodischen breiten Hut und gelb- und braungetupfte Strümpfe. Sie reagierte sehr geschickt, indem sie mir Recht gab, und wir trennten uns im Frieden. -- Nachdem ich die Brücke passiert hatte, bog ich schräg nach links über den alten Garten ab (während der Weg zur Schloss-Strasse geradeaus gegangen wäre) -- und kam nun in sehr alte Gassen, die als gefährlich verufen waren, weil dort Schläger wohnten. Die Häuser standen hier so dicht aneinander, dass ein Mensch nicht in ganzer Breite, sondern nur seitlich, mit einer Hüfte und Schulter voran darin Platz hatte. Ich folgte zunächst einer dieser Gassen (die es in Wirklichkeit in Schwerin nicht gibt), die geradeaus verlief, nicht sehr lang, und auf einem kleinen Platz mit einer Brücke endete. Dort ging noch rechtwinklig eine zweite solche Gasse ab, die ich aber nicht wählen durfte, weil sie sehr gefährlich war. Ich ging links über die Brücke und kam nun in eine sehr lange, dauernd in leichter Krümmung verlaufende und fast noch schmalere Gasse, die wohl die Krümmung einer Stadtmauer mitmachte. Die Häuser schoben sich hier fast der Brust und dem Bauch entgegen und von hinten glitt der Rücken an ihnen entlang, wenn man sich seitlich zwischen ihnen hindurchschob. Mir gelang dies in grosser Geschwindigkeit und beinahe in einer gewissen Heiterkeit. Ich hatte ganz leichte Tennisschuhe an, die mir eine mühelose Fortbewegung erlaubten, so dass ich nicht fürchten musste, von hinten eingeholt zu werden. Die Häuser waren fensterlos. Endlich endete die Gasse, die ja nur wie eine Gletscherspalte so schmal war, und ich konnte nach rechts ausweichen in eine wieder normal breite Altstadtgasse, die wohl in die Schloss-Strasse (nach rechts) führte, und in der auch zum ersten Mal wieder Menschen waren. Hier stand mir ein grosser merkwürdiger Hund im Wege, doch bei näheren Zusehen schien es ein grosser, etwas imbeziller Junge zu sein mit einer Brille. Der Hund, denn ein solcher schien es trotzdem noch immer zu sein -- reichte mir die Hand. Ich wusste nicht, ob ich sie ihm geben sollte, doch jetzt wurde er von den Erwachsenen mit "Spitz" angeredet und zeigte sich in seiner Reaktion tatsächlich als Menschenjunge, so dass ich ihm die Hand gab. (Erwachen, erneutes Einschlafen). Dritte Szene: Bei Amerikanern (dabei die alte Topographie noch irgendwie aufrechterhalten -- wohl in den grossen Schinkel-Gebäuden). Ein Offizier steckte mir amerikanische Zigaretten und Bonbons zu. Es wird über grosse Packungen Tee verhandelt, die er irgendwo hinschicken will. Ich erwache mit dem Bedürfnis, eine Zigarette zu rauchen. Hier folgt im handschriftlichen Manuskript eine ausführliche Skizze, die den Weg über den Tugend-Pfad, die beiden Schlossbrücken und die Schlossinsel zum Alten Garten zeigt und dann links abirrend in das unbekannte Viertel, wobei dieses bezeichnet ist: "dieses Terrain nur im Traum. Zweite Szene. Traumgassen. Hund". Dagegen sieht man rechts die wirklichen Stadtanlagen mit dem "Alten Garten", der Schloss-Strasse, den Schinkelbauten und den beiden Strassen "Kleiner Moor" und "Grosser Moor". (801 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1374 (1954-07-27 - Freiburg)Überqueren einer Strasseneinmündung. Ein heller Personenwagen kommt in solcher Geschwindigkeit herangerast, das es mir nur im letzten Moment noch gelingt, mich auf den Bürgersteig zu retten. Dem Wagen gelingt es nicht mehr, in die Querstrasse einzubiegen, in die die andere Strasse mündet. Nur einen flachen Bogen bringt er zustande und rast dann in ein gegenüberliegendes Schaufenster hinein. Unheimliches Klirren. Die Scherben der Scheibe fallen zu Boden. Dann einen Augenblick eine bedrohliche Stille. Der Wagen ist zum Stehen gekommen, man sieht den Fahrer herausspringen. Doch ehe er das Schaufenster verlassen hat -- ich überlegte noch, ob ich ihm zur Hilfe eilen sollte -- blieb dann aber doch wie gebannt fort, und beobachtete dies auch an den anderen Passanten, besonders einer Nonne oder Schwester, die auf der nächsten Kreuzung stand, - ich hatte gehofft, jemand anders würde ihm zur Hilfe eilen -- doch ehe er das Schaufenster noch verlassen hatte, begann eine Kette von merkwürdigen und starken Detonationen. Der Mann stürzte getroffen im Schaufenster zu Boden, stützte sich aber noch hoch, um zu sehen, während die Heftigkeit der Detonationen zunahm. Ich fürchtete, das Haus würde einstürzen, oder in die Luft gehen. Die Atmosphäre war ungeheuerlich. Ich floh mit äusserster Kraft, um den Bannkreis der Gefahr zu entrinnen, auf die nächste Kreuzung zu. (210 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1375 (1954-07-18 - Freiburg)Um ein kleines Gartenbeet, auf das Heiss und sein Institut Anspruch hatten, ebenso aber anscheinend Bender und Szilasi, deren Figur war im Traum eine. Ich holte im Auftrag von diesen (Bender oder Szilasi) Setzlinge zu einer Pflanze, die buschartig und wohl von Rosengrösse werden würde. Die Wurzeln waren lang und mussten ganz mit Erde bedeckt werden, so dass sie schon fast den grössten Teil des Beetes einnahmen, als ich sie dort eingegraben hatte. Dann säte ich noch Sonnenblumen und noch etwas und hatte nun ein etwas schlechtes Gewissen, denn ich wusste, dass Heiss auch etwas säen wollte, nämlich Kapuzinerkresse. Ich kennzeichnete deshalb den freigebliebenen Rest des kleinen Beetes, der vielleicht gerade noch dafür reichen würde, mit den Buchstaben: K.d.r.V. (das war dasselbe wie Kapuzinerkresse). Als ich die Treppe raufging, sah ich Heiss umgeben von seinen Assistenten und Assistentinnen. Er sagte gerade: "Wir haben da ein Stück Gartenland. Ich denke, wir säen nur etwas Kapuzinerkresse darauf, was soll man da so viel unternehmen", und stellte dann die Treppe hinaufgehend den Rest des "Gartenlandes" mir zur Verfügung, nicht wissend, dass ich alles schon besät hatte. -- Dann kam irgend ein Gespräch mit ihm, in dem er feststellte, ich hätte immer dreckige Fingernägel. Das mache einen schlechten Eindruck. -- Erst als wir uns getrennt hatten, kam mir zum Bewusstsein, dass es die Spuren der Gartenarbeit waren, die Erde, die er an meinen Händen gesehen, aber nicht als solche erkannt hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1376 (1954-07-28 - Freiburg)Unten im Gang lag Post für uns auf der Kommode -- im Zusammenhang mit der erwarteten Geburt unseres Kindes. Darunter ein Brief vom Familienpapst, auf den er noch draussen darauf -- nach Verschliessen -- ein Zitat von Bender geschrieben hatte, in dem dieser sich irgendwo über den guten Kontakt mit seinen Schülern und Hörern äusserte. Ich freute mich darüber. Andere Szene: Auf dem Heimweg von der Uni höre ich, dass Medard Boss, der das Buch über Traum und seine Auslegung geschrieben hat und mit Heidegger befreundet ist, heute Abend einen Vortrag in Freiburg hält. Die Karten sind aber sehr teuer. Ich beschliesse, zu versuchen, ob ich nicht umsonst, vielleicht durch Bender oder notfalls irgendwie durch Heidegger, hereinkomme. (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1377 (1954-08-01 - Freiburg)Reportage im Radio über eine Südseeinsel oder ähnlich. Dort traf man Heidegger. Er wollte sich dort ein Auto kaufen. Ein wenig frappiert über die zudringlichen Fragen des Reporters bringt Heidegger das Gespräch auf die Arbeitsbedingungen. Nachdem es jetzt nicht mehr so heiss sei, auch in dieser Gegend. Vorher, in einer anderen Traumszene, hatte Heidegger ein Konzert der Picht-Axenfeld gehört. Diese Szene und einige andere, die ich vergessen habe, vermischten sich dann in einem endlosen Geflecht zu immer neuen Träumen, als ich beschloss, sie aufzuschreiben. Ich sank immer wieder neu in den Schlaf, träumte, ich hätte sie aufgeschrieben, erwachte wieder leicht und merkte, dass ich es noch nicht getan hatte. Dann spürte ich zuweilen, wie der Stoff sich in erneutem Einschlafen zu neuen und ganz anderen Szenen verdichtete, wobei ich sozusagen in das Erinnerungsbild der alten Träume so weit eintrat, dass aus den alten wieder etwas Neues wurde, das nicht mehr das Alte war, sondern etwas ganz Eigenes und trotzdem irgendwie stofflich das Selbe. -- In diesen Spielen der Phantasie, die nur zuweilen wieder völlig in den Bannkreis des Traumes eintauchen, merken wir irgendwie etwas von einer Materialität, die sich durchhält. Ich meine nicht eine solche des Inhalts, der sich wiederholt, repetiert, das nicht, sondern eine andere stoffliche Identität, so dass ein Bild, das man in der halbwachen Erinnerung als Traumbild fixiert hat, plötzlich etwas anderes ist, etwas Neues, ganz Eigenes, und trotzdem noch das Alte. -- Das bezieht sich auf elementare Qualitäten, wie zum Beispiel eine Mauer, ein Raum, oder Ähnliches. Wie dies das Selbe bleibt, obwohl wir sachlich etwas ganz Neues erleben -- das ist ein Problem in der Reflexion ganz dicht über dem Traum, wo wir plötzlich der merkwürdigen elementaren Identität inne werden, die die Traumszene durchzogen hat, wo das Selbe war, und zwar ganz elementar das Selbe: dieser Stein, diese Wand, und doch nicht das Selbe: der Stein ist dann plötzlich etwas ganz Anderes. Aber die Identität, die beide verbindet, ist nicht etwa Bedeutung oder Ähnlichkeit, sondern stofflich ist es das Selbe. -- Ich glaube, dass diese Selbigkeit die Zeit ist, sowie auch das Haus, in dem wir heute uns streiten, morgen -- und das ist wieder heute -- uns lieben, das Selbe ist doch ein Neues. -- Von all den Szenen, die sich so verflochten, habe ich nur, ausser jener ersten, die dabei als solche fest in der Erinnerung verfügbar blieb, die letzte behalten: Adelheid Dorwarth bekam wieder ein Kind. Sie hatte ein schwarz-weisses (ich glaube) kariertes Kleid an, das ihren Rücken und ihren flachen modellierten Körper schon mit dem Augen tastbar machte, und erzählte mir, dass sie zur Geburt drei Monate in England sein würde, wo sie niemand kennte. -- Ich verstand diese zukünftige Einsamkeit mit ihr und hielt ihren flachen tastbar durchmodellierten Körper ganz fest zwischen meinen Händen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1379 (1954-08-05 - Freiburg)Traum von einem braunen Gott. Viele Einzelheiten der Szene habe ich vergessen. Es spielte ein Mann eine Rolle, der eine merkwürdige braune Gesichtsfarbe hatte -- ein Engländer oder Franzose -- wohl in Uniform. Dieser beugte sich zu jemanden nieder und ging dann zurück. Statt seiner -- sozusagen das Selbe bleibend im Bild -- blieb aber die Figur eines braunen Gottes an der Stelle, die jedoch nicht stand, sondern schwebend aufgehängt war, wobei der Kopf ein wenig tiefer hing als die Füsse. Dies Bild war sehr eindrucksvoll und ich sehe es noch jetzt -- mittags -- vor mir. Der Traum heute Morgen. Anderer Traum: Wir -- Emme und ich -- übernachten in St. Valentin (ein Waldrestaurant, zu dem jetzt sehr oft unsere grossen Waldspaziergänge führen -- in einem alten steinernen Bauernhaus von rechteckiger Form). Das Haus ist aber anders als in Wirklichkeit (was im Traum wie üblich nicht auffällt). Die Treppe führt in eine Art Innenhof -- wohl mit Glas überdacht -- hinauf. Wir gehen allein, um das Zimmer zu suchen. Emme ist schon über das erste Oberstockwerk hinaus. Da kommt unten die Kellnerin zur Tür in das Treppenhaus (das quadratisch ist, und von dem in den einzelnen Etagen etwas winklig Gänge und Türen abgehen) hinein, um uns das Zimmer zu zeigen. Es ist in der ersten Etage. Emme muss also ein paar Stufen zurück. Die Frau schliesst eine alte dunkle Holztür auf und zeigt uns das Zimmer. Wir gehen hinein. Es ist altmodisch eingerichtet.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1380 (1954-08-06 - Freiburg)Ich ging im Nachthemd über die Strasse und schliesslich zu einem Geschäftsmann ins Haus, denn ich hatte eine Wette mit ihm abgeschlossen. Die Angestellten waren sehr verwundert, aber ich forderte mit grosser Selbstverständlichkeit, den Chef zu sprechen, so dass sie nichts sagten. Seine Frau -- ich hatte inzwischen mein Nachthemd in die Unterhose eingesteckt, sagte: "In diesem Tricothöschen können Sie hier nicht gehen." Ich erklärte ihr den Grund, und sie führte mich ins Wohnzimmer. Hier entdeckte ich zu meinem Erstaunen Bilder aus meinen Elternhaus, so den alten Abendmahls-Stich in sehr einfachen, ein wenig kitschigen Farben, der über meinem Bett hing, und die feinen englischen Jagdstiche. Im übrigen war der Raum das Zimmer meiner Mutter. Die Möbel mussten auf dem Umweg über die Beschlagnahme durch die Russen hierher gekommen sein. Später erschien der Herr des Hauses, der den Eindruck eines Gentlemen und eines Kunstkenners machte. Hier schlossen sich noch mehrere Traumszenen an, die mir in der Erinnerung sehr unklar sind. Ich wurde zum Essen gebeten, wollte mich aber erst umziehen, was in dem Wohnzimmer sehr schwierig war. Auch liessen sich meine Haare nicht kämmen, sondern standen zu Berge, weil ich sie gestern gewaschen habe. Schliesslich schlief ich noch in anderen Zimmern und zuletzt kam eine Szene um Sigrid, die in Internaten lebte und nur selten zu Festen nach Hause kam zu Alli (meiner Schwester). An einem solchen Tag war ich gerade dort. Hatte sie aber noch nicht gesehen, und sie musste eigentlich schon wieder weg. Ich überlegte, ob wir sie zu uns nehmen sollten. Bei Alli konnte sie aus irgend einem merkwürdigen Grund nicht sein. (264 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1381 (1954-08-13 - Freiburg)Gesine bekommt Besuch von drei sehr unsympathischen Männern, darunter zwei völlig gleich aussehenden - wie Zwillinge -- geschleckten Schwarzhaarigen, die jenes schleimige unangenehme Lächeln haben, dass man dreinschlagen möchte. Sie kommen spät abends sehr laut die Treppe herauf, während ich in die untere Etage gehe, und sagen zueinander: "Auf der letzten Treppe müssen wir leise sein -- das ist Gesines" (diese wohnt noch oben in ihrem alten Zimmer, in dem jetzt wir wohnen) - "hier unten kannst du noch laut sein." Ich sage: "Seien Sie ruhig im ganzen Haus leise" und, als sie nicht reagieren: "Lächerliches Lumpenpack", oder ähnliches. Mein Zorn steigt dann so, dass ich zuschlage. Meinem Bruder leuchtet diese Form des Angriffs sehr ein. Vorher gingen andere Traumbilder, in denen ein Mädchen mit geschürzten Kleidern und entblösster Scham und sehr schönen braunen Beinen durch Blätter oder Büsche -- wohl mit den Füssen im Wasser- daherkommt. Andere Szene: Ich habe Geburtstag und bekomme von der Baumgärtnerin ein Geburtstagsbad. Doch habe ich sehr starken Hunger, weil ich den ganzen Tag nicht zum Essen kam. Die Baumgärtnerin hat aber dafür gar kein Verständnis. Erwachen mit wirklichem Hunger. Andere Szene: Reinert sieht das Buch von Löwith bei mir liegen ("Das Individuum in der Rolle des Mitmenschen"), ergreift es und findet, dass es ein Exemplar der Universitätsbibliothek ist, in der die Ich-Du-Beziehung stört.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1382 (1954-08-15 - Freiburg)Zunächst ging es um die Einrichtung unseres Zimmers, doch war dies anders als in Wirklichkeit, grösser, andere Möbel, Möbel, die den Barockmöbeln unseres Schweriner Jungenszimmers glichen, ebenso auch die Masse der Räume. -- Doch alles gehörte hier der Baumgärtnerin, und Emme und ich waren, wie in Wirklichkeit, ihre Untermieter. Sie hatte aber einige Möbel vertauscht oder umgestellt, so das Oberteil eines Barockschrankes fortgenommen und eine merkwürdige flache Vitrine noch hinter einem Schrank an die Wand gehängt, und zwar vor einer zweigeteilten Tür (die in der Lage der Zimmer dem entsprach, in dem in meiner Jugendzeit in Schwerin mein Bett stand). -- Wir guckten aus dem Fenster und hörten laute Glockenschläge. Sie kamen von einem mit Türmchen wie eine Kirche gebauten Geschäftshaus (denn die Kirche dahinter, die auch ein neues Geläut hatte, war es nicht, was ich zunächst glaubte). Ich sah aber in dem Geschäftshaus durch zwei Etagen durch einen riesigen Perpendikel schwingen, der unten so weit hin und her schwang, dass er den Platz einer ganzen Veranda dazu brauchte, in der er drin war. Ich fuhr dann aus irgend einem Grunde mit dem Rad fort und holte etwas. Es war Emmes Puppe Eberhard (die eine so grosse Rolle gespielt hat in den letzten Monaten), doch war sie irgendwie in den Regen geraten, und dadurch war ein Auge verwischt, auch war das Gesicht zum Kinn hin etwas verbogen, so dass sie einen völlig anderen Gesichtsausdruck hatte. Doch hatte sie jetzt viele Haare (während diese früher nur in Zelluloid nachgebildet waren). Die konnte man ihr ins Gesicht streichen, dann sah sie sehr lebendig und viel individueller aus. -- Der Traum ist wie die Antwort auf die Schwierigkeiten, die mir ein anderer Traum machte, den ich bis jetzt nicht aufgeschrieben habe, weil er mich zu sehr beschäftigte, und ich ihn nicht fixieren mochte. Es war der erste Traum, aus dem ich nach Ilsabes Geburt überhaupt Bilder festhalten konnte. Vielleicht zwei Tage später. Ich spürte in diesen ersten Nächten nur, dass meine Träume seltsam tief und beinahe magisch waren, als wenn eine tiefe Umstellung sich in ihnen vollzog. Ich konnte sie aber nicht ins Wachbewusstsein hinaufheben. Es war, als wenn sie sich gewaltsam entzögen. Aus diesem ersten Traum, bei dem es anders war, blieben mir zwei Bilder sehr lebhaft in Erinnerung, obwohl sie nur wie Momentphotographien waren. Das erste war eine Szene mit merkwürdig magischen barocken Spiegelmöbeln, zwischen denen eine magische Gestalt, wohl ein Mann, das andere ein nur ganz kurz auftauchendes Bild: Zwei Kinder, die auf einer Art von schwarzen Bahren, die aber wie venezianische Gondeln gebildet waren oder wie Hängematten, und im Schritt leicht schwankten, hinausgetragen wurden. Mich durchfuhr wie ein Blitz die Erkenntnis, dass sie tot waren. Erst allmählich ging mir auf, was dieses Bild bedeutet: Es waren die Zwillinge. (459 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1384 (1954-08-19 - Freiburg)Zu Besuch bei Gregor. Er zeigte mir, dass der Balkon seiner elterlichen Wohnung eigentlich eine Terrasse ist, die mit Stufen zur Strasse herabführt -- nur provisorisch mit einem Gitter abgeschlossen -- mitten auf den Stufen. Seine Eltern hätten ursprünglich einen Laden da einrichten wollen. Man sieht von aussen die Räumlichkeit für ein Ladenlokal. Daneben im Nebenhaus ist direkt anschliessend ein richtiger Laden von Gottlieb in Betrieb (wie man sie hier überall in der Stadt sieht). Wir haben das Gitter der elterlichen Terrasse geöffnet und beobachten nun schelmisch von aussen, wie eine Kundin sich in die Wohnung verirrt -- dort einen Laden wähnend. Wir gehen hinterher, und allerhand verzwickte -- ein wenig intrigante -- Szenen spinnen sich an, die ich vergessen habe. (121 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1385 (1954-08-21 - Freiburg)Fahrt auf einer Strassenbahn - oben an der Stirnseite wie auf dem hohen Bock einer alten Kutsche sitzend. Die Fahrt ist sehr schwankend, weil die Geleise in Reparatur sind. An einer Strassenbiegung oder Kreuzung Endstation. Ein ländliches Gelände vor der Stadt. Ich sehe Tiere, Schweine an der rechten Strassenecke einen steilen Abhang hinauf galoppieren. Sie sind von etwas anderem, anscheinend von Schafen, geritten. Ich erinnere dies nicht mehr deutlich. Die Tiere galoppieren von weitem hinauf. Sie sind mit sich selbst beschäftigt. Ich gehe über die Querstrasse, in die die andere mündet, und werde dort am Strassenrand von einem grossen fasanen- oder putenartigen Vogel angegriffen, der sich mit dem Schnabel in meinen Finger festbeisst, und mir schwer zusetzt. Ich wache allmählich auf, schlafe aber gleich wieder ein, und das Traumbild setzt sich fort. Nur weiss ich jetzt, dass es ein Traumbild ist. Ich bin darum entschlossen, mich mit allen Mitteln zu wehren, und beisse den Puter in den Hals. Es dauert eine Weile, in der ich in Angst schwebe, bis ich aufwache. (171 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1387 (1954-08-25 - Freiburg)Ich bin in Roggow, dem alten Oertzenschen Hof, das aufgesiedelt ist, in der Ostzone. Ich gehe durch den Park, dessen aristokratische Abgeschlossenheit ich so oft genossen habe und der jetzt öffentlich geworden ist und in dem viele einfach gekleidete Menschen spazieren gehen. Dann draussen auf dem Acker, entlang der grossen Mauer, die den Garten einfriedet. Ich sehe dort Männer auf den Feldern, die ich von früher her zu kennen meine, doch zwischen ihnen und mir ist ein Feld mit frisch keimender Saat, über das ich nicht hinweg gehen mag. So nicke ich ihnen nur von ferne zu, ohne feststellen zu können, ob sie mich wieder erkannt haben. (Die Gesichter der Leute waren eigentlich, glaube ich, Gesichter aus Wittmoldt). Andere Szene: Ich begegne auf dem Acker einem Mann, der mir aus dem Krieg als Offizier bekannt zu sein scheint. Er ist jung, untersetzt, in einer etwas militaristischen Kleidung mit Schirmmütze und fühlt sich durch meinen Hut sehr angesprochen. Er erzählt etwas von einem Kavallerie-Regiment. Dann reiten wir zusammen. Er hat ein sehr unruhiges Pferd, doch lässt das meine sich gut beherrschen. Es geht unter Steintoren hindurch, die sehr niedrig sind, so dass wir uns bücken müssen. Das Reiten ist ein grosser Genuss. Das letzte Tor ist so niedrig, dass ich nahezu absteigen muss. Ich bleibe nur in einem Steigbügel stehen, schwinge aber das andere Bein schon herunter und ducke mich ganz dicht auf das Pferd, wie ein Indianer. Später sehe ich, dass das Tor an einer Seite, gerade in der Breite des Reiters, höher war, bewirkt durch ein leicht geöffnetes Oberfenster, so dass mein Vorreiter aufrecht hindurch gekommen war. Er sagt mir, dass mein Reiten sehr gut ausgesehen habe von hinten. Jetzt in Wittmoldt. Der Mann ruft mich telephonisch aus einem Nachbargut an und erzählt mir einen langen Traum, in dem eine Figur wie der Kaiser oder Bismarck eine Hauptrolle spielt und später ein Schwebeerlebnis. Ich sage ihm, dass ich den Traum gerne deuten wolle, jetzt aber nicht könne, weil die Familie Bülow gerade im selben Raum beim Mittagessen sei. Ich würde später zu ihm kommen. -- Mir schwebt eine Deutung der beiden Hauptmomente des Traums vor, ich kann sie aber noch nicht formulieren. Andere Szene: Jetzt wieder in der Ostzone in Richtung auf den Westen, in Begleitung des Mannes, der jetzt ein russischer Offizier ist. Es geht um den Grenzübertritt. Jemand drängt sich durch die Posten und bittet auf der westlichen Seite um Asyl. Dem Offizier scheint das sehr einzuleuchten und er hat ähnliche Pläne. Dann setzt sich die Flucht, oder Grenzübertritt, als Film fort. Zuvor sehe ich noch das Kreisen vieler Düsenjäger, die mit dem Offizier zusammenhängen. Die Bewegung der schlanken Rümpfe ist sehr elegant und vollendet, und ich beobachte sie mit grossem Genuss. Dies geht in den Film über -- von einer Art Zirkusshow, wilde Tiere werden ausgeladen. Erwachen. (471 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1388 (1954-08-29 - Freiburg)Traum von Bender. Ich war in seinem Institut. Es ging um Zeichnungen im Stile der Bilder von Jung, "Psychologie und Alchemie". Vor allem die Frau, die ihren Fischschwanz um den Kopf geschlungen hat. Es waren viele Leute da -- so, wie wenn sehr viel Betrieb bei Bender ist und er sich hier- und dahin wendet, immer abwechselnd. Ich blieb über Nacht im Institut, weil es schon sehr spät war. Mir wurde provisorisch im selben Raum ein Lager gemacht, in dem er schlief. Er war erschöpft. Ich brachte ihm Sahnebonbons (zusammen mit der alchemistischen Zeichnung). Die Sahnebonbonbs wollte ich auf den silbernen Deckel eines kleinen Silbertopfes legen, sozusagen ein Tablett imitierend, aber im Topf war Haferbrei -- unsere Teller waren alle unabgewaschen. So brachte ich ihm die Sahnebonbons so. (128 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1389 (1954-08-31, 08:30 - Freiburg)In Benders Institut. Im grossen Saal, der aber wohnlicher eingerichtet ist und etwas quadratischer. Es sind ziemlich viele Leute da. Familiäre Atmosphäre - Abends. Frau Böhringer liegt auf einer Couch. Ein Hellseher ist da -- anscheinend ein Holländer -- vielleicht in den Dreissigern mit ein wenig Glatze. Es wird noch experimentiert. Und zwar scheint er auch irgendwie politische und geschichtliche Dinge auszusagen, in einer gewissen Reihenfolge nacheinander. Frau Böhringer sagt, zu einem Kuchenteller greifend: "Ich möchte essen, viele Kuchen, bis Ihr angekommen seid in Aachen" (sie sagt das in Bezug auf das Experiment, dessen Aussagen offenbar bis zu einem Ereignis in Aachen weitergehen sollen. Sie will inzwischen den Kuchenteller leer essen. Mir fällt an dieser Aussage aber der Reim auf.) Ich überlege: Kuchen-Aachen. Wenn man die beiden "chen" wegstreicht, bleibt A(a)ku, die Abkürzung für Akkumulator. Aber das kann es nicht sein, was hinter ihrem Reim steckt. Was gibt es sonst noch mit "chen"? Da fällt mir ein Jochen, das muss es sein, es muss jemand geben der Jochen heisst und eine grosse Rolle bei ihr spielt. Ich überlege das alles, während ich mit in dem grossen Raum bin, in dem ein ziemlich buntes Leben herrscht. Bender kommt herein und will sich gerne hinlegen. Es ist aber keine Couch frei. Frau Böhringer sagt: "Das ist ja ganz gut, da kannst Du dich mal recht räkeln". Dann Szenenwechsel: Die Figur von Frau Böhringer hat sich jetzt in die eines weissen Verkehrspolizisten auf der Strasse verwandelt. Ich will ihr gerne meinen Einfall Jochen zu Aachen und Kuchen erzählen und sie fragen, ob es Telepathie ist, und ihr den assoziativen Weg erzählen, auf dem ich dazu gekommen bin. Aber der Verkehrspolizist -- der sie eben jetzt ist -- kann ja nicht von seinem Verkehrsreglerposten mitten auf der Strasse weg. Ich werfe der Gestalt einen Blick zu. Da erhebt sie sich schwebend, schwebt nun gleichsam über der Strasse, etwa zwei, drei Meter hoch, regelt aber weiter den Verkehr mit ausgebreiteten Armen, wirkt aber dabei wie ein Schwimmer, mit angehobenen Kopf und schaut mir fixierend in die Augen. Ich beginne nun erneut meine Erklärung von Aachen, Kuchen und Jochen. Während dem kommt ein grosses Langholzfuhrwerk die Strasse entlang und hält genau unter dem Polizisten, mit dem ich als Frau Böhringer spreche. Er stellt sich aus seiner Schwebelage jetzt auf das Fahrzeug und klettert über das Langholz zu mir herab, während andere Polizisten unten hineinlaufen und das Fahrzeug überprüfen wollen, so dass er jetzt frei ist. Bei mir auf dem Bürgersteig angekommen verwandelt sich die Gestalt wieder zurück in Frau Böhringer, die jetzt einen weissen Bademantel trägt und mit mir die Strasse entlang geht, während ich ihr die Aachen-Kuchen-Aku-Jochen-Assoziation erkläre. Sie wirkt plötzlich sehr erschöpft, und ich muss sie stützen. Sie sagt, es käme von einem Bade, das sie genommen habe. Ich merke aber deutlich, dass sie die Geschichte so aufregt, die also offenbar telepathisch angezapft war. Sie scheint vorauszusetzen, dass ich jemand aus ihrer Umgebung, der Jochen heisst, kenne, und ist sehr verwundert, als ich ihr klarmache, dass ich keine Ahnung habe. Der einzige Jochen, der mir einfällt, ist mein gestorbener Stiefbruder Jochen. Sie ist immer erstaunter, und ich überlege immer noch, ob es nun Telepathie ist oder eine blosse Zufallsassoziation: "Ich möchte essen viele Kuchen, bis Ihr gekommen seid nach Aachen." -- Während ich noch überlege, langsames Aufwachen.

Dort spielt ein sogenannter "Standardwert" eine schier undurchschaubare Hauptrolle. So begreife ich von der ganzen Erzählung auch fast nichts, schaue nur melancholisch über eine Brücke ins Wasser. Dann finde ich an der Litfass-Säule einen Aufruf, der zum Gespräch mit irgend einer wissenschaftlichen Grösse auffordert und der mit Schultz-Hencke unterschrieben ist. Er ist gedruckt in flimmernder Schrift wie der Vorspann eines Films. Es stehen viele Psychologiestudenten bei der Brücke herum und diskutieren. Es scheint ein grosser Kongress zu sein. Aus einem Lautsprecher hört man die Stimme Martin Niemöllers, der gerade zu irgend einem Problem Stellung nimmt. Szilasi kommt über die Strasse und hört mit gerunzelter Stirn, was Niemöller sagt. Macht irgend eine Bemerkung dazu, während er mich und den neben mir Stehenden begrüsst, den er mit Herr Esser anredet. Vorher in einer anderen Szene Begegnung mit Schultz-Hencke. Er ist ein Mann, der mit lebhaften Handbewegungen diskutiert und aussieht wie Bollnow. (176 words)

Er wohnte -- als Benders Gast -- in meinem Käfig und war sehr stolz auf einen Schrank aus rohem Kistenholz voller Zigarren, der in der Form meinem Traumkistle glich. Auch der Käfig ist ja aus rohem Kistenholz. Zigarren, vor allem ganz schmale, lange, waren sehr elegant darin aufgestellt. Ausserdem eine Menge Pfeifenreiniger, über deren Wert Orlop einen Vortrag hielt. Wir kamen zu ihm, um ihm, als Uhrmacher, denn das war sein Beruf -- eine Rechnung zu zahlen. Er forderte für eine kleine Reparatur fünf Mark achtzig. Emme war entsetzt, doch sagte ich beruhigend, "das ist schon in der Ordnung" und dachte an seine Hellseh-Ergebnisse, sprach es aber nicht aus, da er offensichtlich kein Wiedererkennen hatte mit mir.

Bei dem Versuch, diese zusammenzuhalten, entstand ein neuer Riss und so fort, bis schliesslich das ganze Gebilde sich in immer kleinere Teile auflöste und zuletzt wie eine Plastik aus Seesand körnig zerfiel. Ich war sehr unglücklich, denn einzelne Teile, wie zum Beispiel die Ohren, waren besonders gut gelungen. (97 words)

Die Stimmung war so dicht, dass sie mich noch lange im Erwachen gefangen nahm. Trotzdem kann ich das Gewebe nicht wieder herstellen. Der Traum hatte als Ganzes eine sammelnde heilende Wirkung und endete in einer grossen Heiterkeit, die mit dem Namen Wien verbunden war. Es war etwas Strahlendes Barockes, und ich war mit Emme dort. In den Anfangsszenen spielte Gisela eine Rolle. Es war eine Situation der Trauer und der Sehnsucht, aber doch von einer tiefen Erfülltheit. Dann kamen Szenen in der Richtung von Benders Institut. Frau Böhringer, die gewissermassen jetzt die Rolle Gisela übernommen hatte, hatte einen Schizophrenen, der ihr wie viele andere Männer diente, dessen Verehrung sie genoss. Er lag und war nicht mehr zu vielem fähig, aber er hatte neben sich ein Dimaphon mit vielen Platten, die er laufen liess. Ich hörte dort einige Platten ab. Er sagte einen stereotypen Spruch. Etwa: "Wenn Sie eine Leistung gemacht haben, die meiner Arbeit zu Gute kommt, dann will ich sie honorieren und umgekehrt." Der Satz war so stereotyp, dass ich, während er ihn sprach, ihn noch einmal geflüstert hörte, offenbar durch das Dimaphon. (191 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1402 (1954-09-13 - Freiburg)Traum wie Kriminalfilm. Gemeinsame Sache mit zwei Komplizen. Zunächst sind wir bei einem Schuster, dem ich meine Sandalen gebe, zur Reparatur. Es sind die, die die Fersen ganz frei lassen und die ich sehr liebe. Er sagt, die Sohle sei schlecht und zerbricht sie einfach. Ich bin empört. Dann gebe ich ihm ein zweites Paar derselben Art, und sage, er solle dieses um Gottes Willen nicht auch auf seine Bruchfestigkeit probieren, sondern es reparieren. Aber er zerbricht auch dieses kurzerhand. Ich entbrenne in heisser Wut. Andere Szene: Wir haben uns irgendwo Geld gestohlen für eine kriminelle Sache. Es ist ein Haus mit vielen Räumen, in dem wir umherschlüpfen. Plötzlich hören wir aber Schritte, und merken, dass wir entdeckt werden. Es kommt eine weibliche Kriminalbeamtin. Das Merkwürdige ist nur: Sie kommt wegen eines ebenfalls im Hause verübten Sittlichkeitsverbrechens, mit dem wir gar nichts zu tun haben. Es ist dunkel bei ihrem Hereinkommen. Die selbe Szene habe ich schon genauso erlebt. Da überlege ich mir in dem Moment: Ich will doch mal versuchen, ob man so einen Film nicht beeinflussen kann, gehe an den Knipser und drehe mit aller Kraft -- gleichsam gegen den Ablauf des Films -- das Licht an, was nur sehr mühsam gelingt.

Sie (Emme und zugleich Emmi) geht noch einmal hinaus, um noch etwas zu holen. Während dem bewegt sich der Käfig wie ein Fahrstuhl in die Höhe in ein Dachgestühl, auf dessen Balken ich während der Fahrt mit den nackten Füssen spiele. Dort oben fährt er auch seitwärts und schliesslich kommt er am alten Platze wieder an. Jemand bringt mir eine Hormonbüchse, die Pahl verschrieben hat -- doch scheinen es nur Vitamine zu sein -- irgendwo am Rande steht auch "Hormone". Während ich sie noch betrachte, kommt ein kleiner wendiger Mann herein, der etwas bringen will. Er hat ein humorvolles und zugleich geistvolles Lächeln. Ich denke im ersten Moment, es sei der Goldschmied Heilscher, der einen Haken an Emmes Armband repariert hat, er läuft hinaus durch den Windelgang und schlägt die Windeln ausgelassen und vergnügt zur Seite und schiebt sie vor, so dass wir schliesslich unter einem Zelt von Windeln stehen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1407 (1954-09-22 - Freiburg)[Vor der Abreise in die Schweiz.] Auf Reisen in der Ostzone in meiner Heimatstadt Schwerin, wo ich mich nicht mehr zurechtfinde, weil alles verbaut und verändert ist. In der Strassenbahn wird auf pünktliches Aufstehen geachtet, wenn alte Leute hereinkommen. Die Bahn wird immer voller. Zuletzt muss ich vorne auf der Stossstange sitzen. Die Bahn schwebt über grosse Strecken hinweg an Drahtseilen, besonders zur Überwindung von grossen Höhenunterschieden. Ich suche den Weg ins Elternhaus, weiss aber nicht recht, ob ich in der richtigen Richtung fahre, weil die Linien verlegt sind. Schliesslich verschwindet die schwebende Strassenbahn auch noch in einem Haus, durch das sie irgendwie hindurch fährt, wobei ich aber den Kontakt verliere und von meiner Stoss- oder Kupplungsstange herunter gerate. Ich sehe dann die Strassenbahn jenseits in der Strasse weiterfahren, kann sie aber nicht mehr erreichen. Jetzt gerät mir eine Frau mit zwei Dackeln an einer langen Leine in den Weg, von denen der eine sofort nach mir beissen will. Sie hält die Leine, trotz meiner Aufforderung nicht kurz genug, so dass ich schliesslich den Hund am Nacken packe, um ihn ihr zuzubringen. Sie warnt mich, der Hund sei trächtig und würde mich beissen. Ich versuchte, den Hund so aus der Hand zu setzen, dass ihm das nicht möglich war. -- Ich kam dann schliesslich in vertraute Stadtteile -- jene Viertel, in denen ich zuerst fuhr (etwa die Gegend der Lübecker Strasse) waren mir nie vertraut gewesen. Jetzt stand ich in der späten Dämmerung vor dem alten gotischen Dom und überlegte, ob ich -- wie als Kind -- in den dämmrigen Bau hineingehen sollte. Doch hörte ich von innen einen Gottesdienst, den ich nicht stören wollte. So ging ich weiter und war im Nu, viel schneller als es mir möglich schien, am See beim Museum und dem von der östlichen Regierung neu angestrichenen Theater. Hier waren östliche Soldaten zu Pferde auf dem Alten Garten bei Übungen. Da sie scharf ritten, kam ich ins Gedränge, doch wechselten die russischen Soldaten freundliche Worte mit mir. (326 words)

Ein Unterschied fiel mir im Traum nicht auf. Es war eben unsere Wohnung, in die er seit kurzem eingezogen war. Die Traumwohnung war aber vom Wachen her gesehen etwas anders als unsere Freiburger Wohnung -- aber ähnlich. Ich kam in das grosse Zimmer hinein -- während ich mit Emme im kleineren geschlafen hatte -- und traf ihn dort. Wir sprachen einige Worte. Plötzlich fiel mir etwas auf: Auf meiner Couch lag ein wunderschöner Teppich aus dem Elternhaus. Ich sprach es aus. T.W. war sehr stolz. Dann entdeckte ich andere Teppiche aus dem Elternhaus auf dem Fussboden und in einem Nachbarzimmer, das an dieses anschloss wie das Zimmer meiner Mutter im Elternhaus an das Wohnzimmer. Schliesslich entdeckte ich auch die Ahnenbilder an den Wänden. Doch die Teppiche waren achtlos verteilt, so dass sich die Farben bissen, die Bilder konventionell nebeneinander gehängt, ohne Rücksicht auf ihre Form und ohne Auswahl. So war mir das Ganze, trotz meiner Liebe zu dem Teppich und einigen der Bilder, ein Alpdruck. Es war eine unzulängliche Kopie des Alten, und ich war unglücklich, dass er mir vorgegriffen hatte. Ich erzählte es Emme im kleinen Zimmer, und wir stellten fest, dass er von unserer Wohnung Besitz ergriffen hatte, eben weil er jetzt auch in ihr wohnte. Wir wussten nicht, wie das Problem zu lösen sei. (236 words)

Sie sagt den Namen eines Mieters. Später merke ich aber: die Hausbesitzer meint sie. Sie will den ganzen Betrieb aufkaufen (die Eisdiele, in die diese sechzigtausend Mark investiert haben sollen). Ich sage ihr, jetzt plötzlich Interesse an der Sache gewinnend, die mich doch eigentlich nichts angeht: "Sie können ja vielleicht Geld investieren, wenn die Besitzer nicht gleich den ganzen Betrieb verkaufen würden." -- Während dieses Gesprächs kommt die Baumgärtnerin die Treppe hoch, in der Kommode auf halber Höhe etwas nachzusehen. -- Die Frau, die immer noch vor der Tür steht, hat sich inzwischen nackt ausgezogen. In dem Bestreben, nicht so laut zu sprechen, damit die Baumgärtnerin nicht alles hört, trete ich sehr dicht an die Tür heran. Die Frau hat nämlich den Satz mit dem Geldinvestieren nicht richtig verstanden. Sie begreift überhaupt merkwürdig langsam. Ich trete also ganz dicht heran, und ihr nackter Körper steht vor der Tür -- Es gehört zu der Freiheit, die ich ihr wie allen meinen Gästen, lasse. Doch weil die Baumgärtnerin nicht alles hören soll und ausserdem sich plötzlich eine Menge Menschen (Neugieriger) auf der Treppe gesammelt hat, ziehe ich sie zu mir herein, um zwei dunkle Vorhänge hinter ihr zu schliessen. Noch muss ein Teil der Menschen mit herein, wie mir jemand -- ich glaube mein Bruder -- kommentierend sagt. Das sind erstmals zwei etwas bunt angezogene Spanier, die einfach zu mir gehören, und dann einer, den ich ausschliessen will, von dem aber gesagt wird, es sei ihr Mann. So muss er mit herein. Er steht etwas steif vor der nun durch braune Samtvorhänge geschlossenen Tür. Sie führt nämlich ein Doppelleben -- diese Szene ist jetzt sehr dicht -- mit ihm und mit mir, und ich liebe sie. Sie schreibt über das alles Bücher und dann wieder Bücher über die Bücher anscheinend. Das ist sehr kompliziert, und ich liebe gerade das leidenschaftlich an ihr (die Szene ist hier ganz anders mit viel mehr Beteiligung als am Anfang des Traums. Wir sprechen über diese Bücher (ihres Lebens) und die Bücher der Bücher, und ich sage, es hänge mit dem Transcendentalen zusammen, und nehme dabei Kant -- einen sehr schönen alten Band -- aus der grossen Bibliothek an den Wänden. Ein Buch über die Transcendentalphilosophie, die "Kritik der Urteilskraft" ist es wohl -- das auch ihr Mann -- also mein Rivale - , mit dem ich auf dieser Ebene einig bin, sehr liebt. Ich erkläre ihr, das sei das selbe wie ihre Bücher -- die Bücher ihres Lebens, die sie schreibt -- und die Bücher der Bücher (also eigentlich die Bücher über ihr Bücherschreiben), die sie ebenfalls schreibt: das sei erstens das Transcendentale, zweitens die transcendentale Methode (Erfahrung) und drittens die Geschichte dieser transcendentalen Methode. Ich meine das dabei so, dass ihre Bücher und Bücher der Bücher, das womit sie ihr Leben und sich selbst als Begleitende schreibend begleitet, das Selbe seien, wie diese transcendentale Philosophie, dieses Buch -- und ihr Mann, der in stiller Rivalität an der Tür gestanden hatte, ist mit mir darin völlig einig. Er geht völlig leidenschaftlich -- ebenso wie ich in dieser transcendentalen Philosophie auf, die das Selbe ist wie ihr Leben und ihr Schreiben darüber, - und unsere Rivaliät ist darin aufgehoben, ebenso aber gipfelt meine leidenschaftliche Liebe zu ihr, die immer noch durchzogen ist von dieser Nacktheit in diesem Akt des Herausnehmens des Buches.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1413 (1954-09-29 - Kreuzlingen)[Nach der Niederschrift dieses Traums gegen dreiviertel fünf erneutes Einschlafen, wobei mir sehr deutlich -- in einer gewissen Überklarheit - die Traumbilder des Einschlafens sichtbar wurden, während ich draussen noch die vorbeifahrenden Autos hörte und gleichsam mit einem Bein noch im Wachen war.] Ich überlegte mir, dass ich jetzt noch in der Lage sei, mich wieder aufzuwecken, führte aber dieses Experiment nicht aus, weil ich mich lieber der Betrachtung der Bilder und der Behorchung der Strassen hingeben wollte, wobei mir zugleich klar wurde, dass damit der Freiheit des Erwachens, die immer noch in meiner Hand stand, eben doch durch diese Neigung eine Grenze gesetzt sei, eben weil, trotz der Freiheit der Entscheidung, eben diese Neigung es war, die die Entscheidung zum Schlaf bestimmte. So gab ich mich ganz dieser Neigung hin, schlief sehr tief ein. Von diesen Einschlafbildern und Stimmen (beides spielte die gleich wichtige Rolle) ist mir inhaltlich kaum etwas in Erinnerung geblieben. Ich weiss nur, dass es sehr elementar war, keine zusammenhängenden Szenen, aber eine bedeutungsvolle Zusammengehörigkeit isolierter Elemente, die in ihrer Elementarität berauschend waren. Es waren einzelne Gesichter darin. Von diesen erinnere ich nur noch eine der Kasperlepuppen, die mir Fräulein Schwann gestern zeigte, die sie mit den Patienten gemacht hat, und die Stimmen hatten die Färbung des Sprachengewirrs, sie sprachen englisch-holländisch-französisch-schweizerisch, auf das ich immer horchen muss, wenn ich das Reden der Patienten verstehen und in ihre Welten hineinhorchen will. Dies alles war hier aber verselbständigt, ins Elementare zerlegt, ohne Bezug zu einzelnen Personen. (Es erinnert mich an die Stimmen und Gesichter des Schizophrenie-Wahns, dessen Schilderung ich gestern Abend las). Dann sehr tiefer Schlaf, aus dem ich am Morgen eine Stunde zu spät (um acht Uhr) mit lebhaften Träumen erwachte: (241 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1414 (1954-09-29 - Kreuzlingen)Von diesen Träumen blieben mir zwei Szenen in Erinnerung. Die eine handelte von einer körnigen Fleischspeise, die wir essen sollten, ihre Struktur war wir die von Reisauflauf, den wir gestern Abend assen, doch noch zusammenhängend. Diese Masse wurde vorher spasseshalber Herrn M. (einem jungen schizophrenen Patienten) als Hut auf den Kopf gestülpt, was sehr gut zu seiner etwas stupierten Physiognomie passte, auch anderen Patienten wurden Hüte oder Kappen daraus gemacht. Dann sollten wir es essen. Doch plötzlich merkte ich, dass die einzelnen körnigen Teilchen (in der Struktur wie bei Durchgedrehtem) sich selbständig machten als kleine Lebewesen und in zwei Parteien übereinander herfielen, um sich gegenseitig zu zerfressen und zu zerfleischen. Ich sah hier den Beginn einer völligen Katastrophe. Auch hatten die Tierchen, die ich, glaube ich, als Fleischwürmer bezeichnete, plötzlich Flügel und erhoben sich, um aus dem silbernen Topf herauszuschwirren. Mir schoss die furchtbare Einsicht durch den Kopf, dass diese Fleischwürmer unsere gesamte Nahrung befallen und zerstören und vergiften würden. Ich war wohl der einzige unter uns, dem diese Konsequenz klar wurde. Und so stülpte ich entsetzt den silbernen Deckel auf den Topf (der die Form runden Koch- und Essgeschirrs hatte) und konnte so das Entweichen der meisten Tiere und damit die Katastrophe verhindern. Nur einige wenige schwirrten in die Luft. Mir war nach dem Erwachen sofort klar, dass diese Selbstzerfleischung eine Darstellung der Schizophrenie war und direkt eine Umsetzung der Darstellung des Wahns (Suzanne Urban), die ich gestern Abend gelesen hatte. -- Der Traum war -- wie der aus der Nacht -- sehr eindrucksvoll für mich. Eine andere Szene, von der ich nicht weiss, ob sie vorherging oder folgte, war folgende: Fräulein Schwann (die Betreuerin der Patienten) wollte mich heiraten. Ich sagte: "Ich hab doch eine Frau!" Sie antwortete: "Die musst Du gehen lassen", oder "verlassen." Ich antwortete triumphierend: "Ich habe doch ein Kind!" Sie antwortete: "Das musst Du mitbringen". (311 words)

In den Kanälen zwischen den Seen ist das Wasser knapp. Für das Schiff ist eine Extrarinne gegraben, in die gerade der Kiel hineinpasst. Ich bin erstaunt, dass es nicht umfällt, bei so wenig Wasser. Aber wir kommen durch. Nur müssen wir uns dauernd bücken, um nicht die Köpfe zu stossen, denn auch die Schleuseneingänge sind zu niedrig. Einmal in einer Schleuse scheint das Schiff senkrecht hinabzugehen, denn unsere Stühle kippen einfach um neunzig Grad und wir sitzen trotzdem wieder waagerecht. -- Andere Szene: Elternhaus, aber kleiner geworden. Pelziges gelbes Fell (wie gelber Frotteestoff). Ich will es erst verschenken, meine, dass es noch rohes Lammfell sei, merke dann aber, dass es schon verarbeitet ist. Es ist gelb-rot gestreift. Auch Emme gefällt es sehr. Dann habe ich Brot über, das in der Struktur wie das Lammfell ist -- pelzig, porös. Ich weiss nicht, wo ich es lassen soll. (152 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1416 (1954-10-01, 03:30 - Kreuzlingen)Am Vorabend eines grossen Festes, wohl Weihnachten. Ich gehe mit Emme nachts durch eine Halle, wohl Bahnhofshalle, in der sorgfältig gekleidete grauhaarige Gestalten, - unter ihnen der schwermütige holländische Doktor, und die Anderen alle irgendwie wie Abwandlungen seines Gesichts -- einer von ihnen wohl auch wie Herr von E. -- an den Pfeilern lehnen und scheinbar schlafen. Doch fast alle schlagen die Augen auf und blinzeln mich freundlich an. Ich grüsse sie, indem ich den Hut ziehe (bei jedem) und sie erwidern ebenso den Gruss -- trotz aller Schläfrigkeit und Melancholie -- freundlich -- wie ein kurzes Erwachen und schlafen dann wohl wieder ein. Ich habe im Durchschreiten der Halle das Gefühl, dass sie alle morgen wohl nicht wissen werden, dass ich wirklich an ihnen vorbeigegangen bin, und denken werden, sie haben von mir geträumt, und dass es dann merkwürdig sein wird, dass sie gleichsam alle das Selbe "geträumt" haben werden. Emme hatte vorher gefürchtet, sie würden mir meinen nächtlichen Gang durch die Halle übelnehmen, doch ihr Gruss war bei allen freundlich. Wir kommen nun (nach dem Gang durch die Halle) in einen Raum, in dem ihre Mutter und ihre Geschwister leben (sie leben alle in einem Raum). Dort ist ein jüngerer arroganter Onkel zu Besuch, der sehr aufgebracht ist über unser, besonders über mein, nächtliches Ankommen. Emme spürt das sofort. Sie sagt laut: "Hier geht es nicht so gut wie bei dem Gang durch die Halle." Der Onkel sagt etwas hysterisch, als er uns sieht: "Dann muss ich eben abreisen." -- Alle liegen auf Betten -- es ist Nachts -- und empfinden unsere, besonders meine, Ankunft dabei als beleidigend. Ich sage, fast bewusst etwas hysterisch reagierend: "Nach dem Sie das gesagt haben, müssen wir sofort umkehren und abreisen" und laufe heraus. Emme kommt hinterher, will ausgleichen und beschwichtigen. Ich sage: "Sei doch froh, wenn er abreist" (und denke dies durch mein Verhalten, das auf seines eingeht, zu erreichen). "Dann sind wir wenigstens ungestört." (324 words)

Bäume werden gefällt und fallen in den Spalt hinein, doch treffen die Bettler nicht. Wasser ist auch da -- irgendwie ein Fluss. Ich falle fast hinein ins Wasser, beim Fallenlassen meines Baums, doch kann geschickt über ihn wegspringen. Ein Bettler oder Landstreicher sucht die vier Mandalafarben. Ein anderer, der nicht wie Alle sorglos ist, hat sich lauter Strassenbahnfahrscheine zusammengebettelt. Ich denke, er habe sie gestohlen, und beginne, um ihn davon zu befreien, sie ins Wasser zu werfen. Doch er kann mich überzeugen, dass man sie ihm geschenkt hat. So ziehe ich sie wieder raus. Schliesslich geht es um einen Tanz vier alter Männer. Eine Art barockes Menuett. Ich tanze mit. Der Tanz ist sehr heiter. Dann Anwesenheit der alten Männer in einer psychologischen Testgruppe. Dort wird etwas vorgeführt, ein Test. -- Dies alles nur Bruchstücke eines grösseren Traums. (173 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1418 (1954-10-02, 06:30 - Kreuzlingen)Flug in einem Segelflugzeug mit Motor. Zwei ältere Männer, einer sitzt vorne neben mir und einer hinter uns. Der eine startet das Flugzeug. Man spürt zuerst das Schüttern des Bodens, dann wird die Bewegung ebenmässig. Wir wollen über das Mittelmeer. Ich kann nach dem Aufsteigen noch wenig sehen. Die Scheibe scheint schlecht durchsichtig zu sein. Noch dicht über dem Häusern gibt mir der Mann den Steuerknüppel, oder besser die, denn es sind zwei, einer rechts von mir, den man nach rechts und links bewegen kann, und einer vor mir -- zwischen den Beinen - , den man nach vorne und hinten bewegen kann. Ich habe keine Ahnung, wie man sie bedient, doch er gibt sie mir einfach, und ich probiere es aus. Der rechte lenkt den Seitenflug im Spiel nach rechts und links, der andere Heben und Senken im Spiel nach vorne und hinten. Nach einigen Versuchen habe ich es in der Hand. Doch fliegen wir noch sehr tief und vor uns kommt ein Haus, an dem gebaut wird. Eine Art Brücke oder Brückengang führt hinüber zu einem Nebengebäude, der Bauhütte. Ich gebe wieder dem alten Mann neben mir die Steuerknüppel. Er sagt, wir müssen unter der Brücke durch und steuert rückwärts stehend, so dass er sich über die Schulter schauen muss. Der Durchgang ist etwas schmal. Er muss das Flugzeug etwas seitlich stellen. Dies gelingt, doch setzt er dabei auf dem Boden auf. Auch dabei scheint alles in Ordnung zu sein. Doch auf einmal merke ich, dass unten eine gelbe Flüssigkeit herausplätschert. Der Benzintank ist leck geworden. Es strömt in grossen Mengen aus und läuft dem Gefälle folgend in das Nebengebäude, eine Art Verwaltungsraum der Baufirma. Dort steht ein grosser fontänenartiger Springbrunnen, mit dessen Wasser sich nun das Benzin vermischt (die gelbe Flüssigkeit mit dem Wasser einer der Fontänen). Ich bin entsetzt und frage die beiden Männer: "Gibt das nicht Explosionsgefahr?" Sie nicken mit ernster Miene. Die Folgen können gross sein, zum Beispiel die Bauleute nebenan im grossen Haus ihre Arbeit einstellen müssen wegen der Explosionsgefahr. (337 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1419 (1954-10-04 - Freiburg)Auf Reisen in Russland. Wir fahren mehr oder weniger dorthin gezwungen, doch bewegten uns frei in den Zügen. Ich wollte nach China. Einmal sah ich einen russischen General auf der Strasse gehen, als ich aus dem Zug blickte. Sein Gesicht war ungeheuer eindrucksvoll. Ich schaute ihm fest in die Augen, und obwohl der Zug sich entfernte, schien sein Kopf ins Unermessliche zu wachsen und das ganze Bild zu erfüllen. Bald danach wurde mein Pass kontrolliert, doch wusste ich nicht, ob ein Zusammenhang bestand. Andere Leute kamen wie ich gerade von Binswanger. Ein älterer Herr hatte ein Buch mit seiner Signatur. Dann begegnete mir eine alte, etwas heiter verschrobene Dame. Sie war Königin von Sachsen und die Russen hatten ihr erlaubt, in ihrer alten Residenz, offensichtlich Warschau, wieder zu residieren. Sie hatte einen ganzen Hofstatt, dem ich mich anschloss, um so in den Westen (statt nach China) zu kommen. (148 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1421 (1954-10-07 - Freiburg)Traum von Karl Jaspers. Er wurde auf einer Konferenz im Gespräch von einem Studenten begleitet, mit dem ich viel zusammen war und dem ich kleine Hilfsdienste, wie das Einstecken von Post etc., versprochen hatte. In der Tendenz, dieses Versprechen zu erfüllen, musste ich mehr oder weniger hinter ihm oder damit auch hinter Jaspers herlaufen. Mich ärgerte dies. Jaspers wollte nach London abreisen und dabei den Studenten per Schiff mitnehmen. So blieb ich allein zurück. Ein Amerikaner meinte. "Erst dauernd mit berühmten Leuten herumlaufen und nachher allein zurückfahren". Das fand er falsch. (91 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1422 (1954-10-07 - Freiburg)Später anderer Traum um Binswanger. Er hatte einen Oberarzt, der im Gesichtsausdruck und Mimik wie Emmes Mutter aussah. Das schien mir sehr bedeutsam. (23 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1423 (1954-10-08 - Freiburg)Ich deutete heute Nacht im Traum sehr ausführlich einen Traum, den mir ein Lehrer des Traumdeutens, wohl Bender, erzählt hatte -- er stünde in einem Lesebuch. Dieser Traum handelte zunächst von einem Streichholz und einer Apfelsine. Dann spielte eine Frau in russischen Röcken eine Rolle. Ich stellte mir dabei bauschige, in vielen Stufen bis zum Boden herabfallende Röcke aus glänzendem Satin vor. Dann ein Schiff, bauchig und voll -- ich sah es auf einem farbigen Bild, das der Träumer gemalt hatte und das in der Halle des Hauses hing, in dem wir waren. In diesem Schiff lag ein schmales Paddelboot. Später war das Schiff voll blauen Wassers, so dass das Paddelboot in seinem Element war. So hatte es der Träumer gemalt -- in Farben übrigens, die an die drei Schiffe van Goghs auf dem Strand erinnern, also sehr kräftig. Der Träumer hatte hierzu einen Vers oder Spruch aufgeschrieben, der sehr schwermütig und jünglingshaft war. Ich deutete den Traum im Gespräch mit dem Traumlehrer folgendermassen: "Das Streichholz ein Phallussymbol, die Apfelsine ein Symbol für die Vagina. Beim Streichholz ist noch wichtig, dass es sich entzünden kann. Ebenso ist das Schiff, das grössere, ein weibliches Bild, das Paddelboot aber ein männliches. Wenn das Wasser dazu kommt, ist es in seinem Element." Der Mann war mit dieser Deutung einverstanden. Ich konnte mir den Typ des Mädchens mit den russischen Röcken sehr gut vorstellen: es musste ein bestimmter, sehr pathetischer Typ sein. Ich dachte dabei an Gisela. Später gingen wir auseinander. Ich ging in einen dunklen Winkel des Flurs, oder der Halle, wo das Traumbild hing, und nahm, da ich einen starken Blasenandrang fühlte, einen Nachttopf, der dort stand. Ich empfand das Strömen des Urins, das gar nicht enden wollte, als sehr wohltuend, war aber zugleich ein wenig in Spannung, ob nicht einer der Gäste des Hauses aus den Türen oder der Traumlehrer (die Räumlichkeit hier wie in Benders Institut) die Treppen hinabkommen würde (die er wohl nach unserer Trennung hinaufgegangen war). Erwachen. (Ich war nach dem Erwachen, noch ganz unter dem Eindruck des Urinstroms, erstaunt, dass ich keinen Blasenandrang verspürte.) (347 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1424 (1954-10-10 - Freiburg)Binswanger hatte mich eingeladen, noch eine Woche länger in Kreuzlingen zu bleiben. Ich sah ihn in dieser Zeit kaum, höchstens, wenn er mit den Patienten sprach. Die Räumlichkeit war insofern im Traum wie in Kreuzlingen, als die grosse Halle, Ess-Saal und Nebenräume wie im Haus Bellevue waren. Aber es schlossen sich andere, grössere Häuser an, mit Zimmern mit vielen Betten, und es waren hauptsächlich jugendliche Patienten da, die wohl alle etwas schizophren waren. Es war zugleich wie in einer Art Herberge. Die Herbergseltern, ein älteres Ehepaar, waren selbst merkwürdig. Die Frau führte ein "verruchtes" Doppelleben. Sie stand nachts auf und ging zu einem anderen Mann. Damit niemand etwas merkte, dass sie aus dem Haus ging, zog sie keine Schuhe an, sondern blieb barfuss und im Nachthemd, so dass es aussah, als ob sie im Haus bliebe. Sie machte den Eindruck des zugleich Kranken und irgendwie Verlockend-Verruchten. Auch Bekannte waren in dem Haus, so die schwarze Dolo. Auch ihre Mutter begegnete mir. Dann war Marion da, die blonde, doch hiess sie im Traum nicht Marion, sondern Gudrun. Wir liebten uns leidenschaftlich und ich tastete mit der Hand ihren nackten, für sie charakteristisch ein wenig hohl gewölbten Rücken und ihre Lenden. Wir wären wohl zu völligen leiblichen Vereinigung geschritten, wenn nicht Emme dazu gekommen wäre, und ich spürte, dass ich ihr damit sehr weh tun würde. Doch blieb dies in der Schwebe, denn ich spürte später, dass wohl auch Emme mit einem anderen Mann ins Bett gehen würde. Es gehörte irgendwie auch zu der Umgebung, deren Atmosphäre zugleich merkwürdig und erotisch sehr frei war. -- Dann andere Szene: Ich sah in die grosse Halle eine Reihe von etwa achtzehn- bis zwanzigjährige Jungen zu einer Art Sprechunterricht strömen. Sie nahmen alle in einem merkwürdigen Gestühl am Rande der Halle Platz, das an ein Chorgestühl -- wie in alten Kirchen -- erinnert. Doch war es sehr modern medizinisch, aus einem weiss-grauen Material. Sie musste dort irgendwelche Sätze sprechen, wobei ihre Hände durch den Bau des Gestühls auf die Oberschenkel gedrückt wurden, so zwangsweise eine gewisse Entspannung, eine Art Autogenes Training hervorrufend -- aber ganz ohne ihre eigene Mitwirkung. Ihre Sätze kamen auch merkwürdig gepresst und künstlich heraus, auch die des Vorsprechers, eines etwa dreissigjährigen Mannes, der die Worte mit der Hand taktierte, wobei sie merkwürdig auseinander gerissen und bruchstückhaft wurden. Der Chor kam mir sehr ungeschickt vor. Ich hatte das Gefühl, ich müsste sie aus dem Gestühl herausnehmen, sie frei werden und sich entspannen lassen, und auch der Vorsprecher schien mir ungeeignet. Dann aber leuchtete mir plötzlich ein, dass sie alle sehr schizophren und darum garnicht suggerierbar und zu einer echten Entspannung zu bringen seien, einschliesslich des Vorsprechers, und dass darum das merkwürdige Gestühl sehr wohl nötig sei, um sie wenigstens äusserlich so weit dazu zu zwingen, dass sie überhaupt sprechen konnten. Ein Teil ihrer Sätze kam übrigens auch tonlos heraus, aber merkwürdig akzentuiert in Luftgeräuschen. Ich wollte eigentlich -- aus der Vorhalle kommend -- durch die Halle gehen, um in den Leseraum neben dem Ess-Saal zu kommen. Um sie aber nicht zu stören, wählte ich einen anderen Weg dorthin. Dort fand ich in einem Schreibtisch dann die Papiere eines Jungen (ebenfalls in dem Alter von zwanzig), der wohl fort war. Unter ihnen einen Brief von mir an Frau P., den ich ungern in fremde Hände kommen lassen wollte. Weitere Szenen sind mir nicht in Erinnerung geblieben. (563 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1425 (1954-10-11 - Freiburg)Traum über Rothacker. Wir standen zusammen mit einigen Studenten am Fenster eines Flurs und schauten hinaus auf die Strasse. Ich freute mich über die nicht gar so konventionelle Schuhkleidung der Leute, die draussen vorbeikamen (es war wohl in der Schweiz). Die Männer trugen dort Mocassins und Slipper, zum Teil ohne Strümpfe, was ich sehr viel einfacher und auch hübscher fand. Ein Mann hatte genau dieselben Schuhe an wie ich. Ich freute mich darüber und dachte: Hat es also doch mal einer nachgemacht. Rothacker, der neben mir stand, auf die Fensterbrüstung gelehnt wie ich, streute währenddem die Asche seiner Zigarette auf meinen Fuss. Ich sagte herabschauend: "Soll das ein Experiment sein?" Er sagte: "Ja". Und während ich noch einen Gedanken nachhing, den ich aussprechen wollte, nämlich, dass das Experiment ganz anders ausgefallen wäre, wenn er statt Asche Wasser gestreut hätte, und dass sich darin die wichtige Rolle der Elemente zeigte -- während ich diese Dinge noch überlegte, machte er schon wieder etwas anderes: Er machte ein Gesicht wie ein Geisteskranker und erklärte mir dann, er wolle die Reaktionen erforschen, die die Menschen aus solche Gesichter machten, und wäre dabei, eine grosse Menge von Menschen (ich weiss nicht, waren es Schüler oder Studenten) auf ihre Reaktionen zu prüfen gegenüber der katatonen, paranoischen und hebephrenen Physiognomik, indem er ihnen mit diesen Gesichtsausdrücken begegne. Ich überlegte mir, was für eine ungeheure Anstrengung er damit auf sich genommen habe. Dann gingen wir den gangartigen Flur entlang bis dort, wo er rechtwinklig um die Ecke bog, und wo auch der Hausausgang war. Es handelte sich um eine Art Lehrinstitut, zugleich universitätsmässig und mit ein wenig militärischem Anstrich. Rothacker hatte dort an der Ecke einen grossen, grauen und dunkel gefleckten Jagdhund mit Schlappohren und gelben Augen, der gerade geschoren wurde. Er band, um ihn zu halten, seinen Kopf mit einem Band an meinen Oberarm. Das Band war so lang, dass ich ungefähr in der Mitte des Hundes stand, wenn es nicht ganz gespannt war. Ich stand hier zunächst mit einer gewissen Ruhe und Gelassenheit, so dass auch der Hund ruhig war, während Männer, ich glaube in weissen Kitteln, auf der anderen Seite ihn schoren. Doch dann gingen die Männer weg, und ich bekam Angst und versuchte, hinter den Hund zu entweichen. Doch das Band war nur so lang, dass ich gerade bis zu seinem Schwanz kam. Der Hund wurde dadurch auch unruhig, sein ganzes Temperament brach aus, er drehte den Kopf um und biss mich in die Schulter. Er war so hoch und gross, dass er dazu kaum den Kopf zu heben brauchte. Ich war nun in dieser Situation ganz allein auf dem Gang, die Zähne des Hundes bohrten sich in meine Schultern, und ich rief um Hilfe, doch gelang mir dies nur sehr leise, und ich musste es mehrmals wiederholen, bis schliesslich aus dem hinteren Ende des Ganges (dem Arm des Ganges, in dem wir noch nicht gewesen waren) ein Mann auf einem kleinen Rollwagen, einem Art Brett ohne Ränder mit ganz niedrigen Rädern herangerollt kam, mich befreite und sagte, er solle mich holen. Dann verschwand er auf die selbe Weise wieder. Ich ging nun den Gang entlang, bis ich ganz am Ende an eine offene Tür kam. Drinnen schien eine Art Konferenz zu sein. Männern in weissen Kitteln. Auch Rothacker war wohl unter ihnen. Doch schien man mich nicht zu brauchen. So kehrte ich um und schlenderte den Gang zurück. Dann war ich wohl noch in einem der angrenzenden Klassenräume. Hier handelte es sich um das Umräumen einer Bibliothek, an dem ich mich kurz beteiligte. Doch merkte ich, dass es sich um Gebiete handelte, mit denen ich eigentlich nichts zu tun hatte. So verliess ich das Haus und stieg in eine Strassen- oder Stadtbahn. Es sassen verschiedene Leute in den Abteilen, und ich sah nun, wie Rothacker hereinkam, und ihnen seine schizophrenen Gesichter vormachte, um ihre Reaktionen zu prüfen. Ich versteckte mein Gesicht ein wenig hinter den Händen, um mich unkenntlich zu machen, weil ich gerne sein Experiment noch einmal beobachten wollte. Doch er erkannte mich trotzdem und verschwand wieder durch die Wagentür. Ich stieg dann um in eine U-Bahn (die jedoch über der Erde fuhr) und hing meine Beine aus dem Fenster, im Rahmen des Fensters sitzend, und sah auf die Stadt, wohl eine Schweizerische Grossstadt, hinab. Es waren moderne und angenehme weisse Häuser. Plötzlich sah ich, dass wir an unserem Wohnhaus (wir wohnten in dieser Stadt) vorbeifuhren (es war etwa einen Strassenzug weiter, zu dem die Bahn nicht parallel, sondern in schräger Richtung verlief.) Mir wurde nun klar, dass ich nicht hätte umsteigen dürfen, weil ich auf diese Weise über mein Ziel hinaus fuhr und weit zurück gehen müsste, und ich wollte doch möglichst bald zu meiner Frau zurück. Auch leuchtete mir ein, dass mein Sitz im Fenster und mit den Beinen nach aussen gefährlich sei, und ich versuchte, während der Fahrt zurückzuklettern. Doch war dies sehr schwierig. Die Beine waren schwer und wie gelähmt, und es gelang nur Zentimeter um Zentimeter, sie zu heben und in den Wagen zurückzustrecken, wobei ich mich drehen und oben am Fenster festhalten musste, was auch sehr schwierig war, da mich der Sog der Fahrgeschwindigkeit fast rückwärts hinausgerissen hätte. Doch gelang mir die Umkehr schliesslich. Daran schloss sich eine andere Szene an: Ein Bekannter erklärt mir, wie sein alter Vater seine Glieder auch nur noch Zentimeter um Zentimeter bewegen konnte. Erwachen. (894 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1426 (1954-10-13 - Freiburg)Zuerst eine Versammlung, in der es darauf ankam, möglichst wenig anzuhaben, möglichst nackt zu sein. Dann nächste Szene (die hiermit noch im Zusammenhang stand): Ich musste für Krückmanns, des Orientalisten, Kinder einen Sandhaufen bauen. Ich hatte dazu gelben Kies und Erde, die noch von Schutt durchsetzt war, noch gesiebt werden musste. Krückmann kam dazu, um zu helfen. Er hatte eine junge Frau bei sich, die als Tante Lola bezeichnet wurde und sehr verführerisch war. Sie hatte schwarze Haare und war zugleich verführerisch und etwas absonderlich, ein wenig exaltiert. Nächste Szene: Ich war wieder auf dem Weg zu der Versammlung, es war gleichzeitig eine Tagung, die etwas an die Schelling-Tagung in Bad Ragaz erinnerte. Auf dem Wege sah ich eine Familie, die eine Frau (wohl mit dem Auto) in Empfang nahm, die aus einer Anstalt kam und, glaube ich, ebenfalls Tante Lola hiess. Sie waren vor mir auf dem Bürgersteig, und ich konnte schlecht überholen, weil die Frau nicht geradeaus ging, sondern in unberechenbaren Wendungen schräg über den Bürgersteig, worin sich ihr schizophrener Charakter ausdrückte. Dabei blockierte sie mir immer den Weg. Ich bewegte mich nicht gehend fort, sondern sass auf einem kleinen Brett mit niedrigen Rädern, einer Art Rollwagen, und stiess mich mit den Händen an den Hauswänden weiter. Ich hielt mich zunächst eine Weile zurück und versuchte dann, in einem geeigneten Moment zwischen ihr und der Hauswand vorbeizukommen. Doch sie wurde sofort auf mein merkwürdiges Gefährt aufmerksam und begann, mich zu schieben, dabei ihre Geschwindigkeit immer vergrössernd und die Verwandten hinter sich zurücklassend. Es ging vom Bürgersteig hinunter und auf der anderen Seite nicht mehr hinauf, sondern sie blieb trotz meiner Warnung mit mir auf der Strasse und vergrösserte die Geschwindigkeit immer mehr, bis schliesslich, als wir mitten auf der Kreuzung gerade bei einer Verkehrsinsel waren, das Geschrei der Verwandten hinter uns hertönte, denen diese Fahrt zu unheimlich war. So hielt ich sie hier gewaltsam an und musste die gewonnene Zeit wieder opfern, um sie zurückzubringen. Das war sehr schwierig, denn sie wollte mit allen Kräften weiter vorwärts, und ich musste sie mit Gewalt zurückschaffen. Zuweilen schienen ihre Kräfte die meinen zu überwiegen und es stand in der Schwebe, wie die Schalen einer Waage. Ich hatte sie schliesslich auf dem Rücken, die Arme um meinen Hals gezogen, und erwachte (um im Erwachen festzustellen, dass Emme genau in dieser Haltung neben mir im Bett lag). (395 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1427 (1954-10-14 - Freiburg)Ich schlief mit Margund in einem fremden Haus. In der Nacht erwachten wir von merkwürdigen Klopfgeräuschen, die als wir uns besannen, aus einem Nachbarzimmer des sonst leeren Hauses zu kommen schienen. Wir sprangen beide aus dem Bett und liefen in Nachthemden auf den Flur und in das andere Zimmer. Dort fanden wir einen jüngeren Mann im Bett in Altkleidern und im Mantel und mit einer Baskenmütze auf, der mit einem langen Stock oder Regenschirm in regelmässigen Abständen auf den Bettrand klopfte und dazu merkwürdig lächelte. Es war sofort klar, dass dies kein Einbrecher sein konnte. Wir dachten zuerst, er wäre betrunken, doch roch er nicht nach Alkohol. Ich fragte ihn sehr energisch aus, und seine Antworten waren merkwürdig widersprechend und undurchdacht und so, dass mein Verdacht auf Schizophrenie immer stärker wurde. Leider habe ich vom den Inhalt des sehr lebhaften Ausfragegesprächs nichts behalten. Erwachen. (Draussen sehr heller Mondschein, auch Emme war wach, und ich hatte das Gefühl, ich musste nach unserem Kind sehen. Fand auch dieses wach und schreiend). (169 words)

Die Reihenfolge war folgende: Zunächst in einem Zimmer die Bienen. Ich fand merkwürdigen waldbodenartigen Dreck auf dem Tisch, den ich fortkehrte. Dann entdeckte ich daneben ein ganzes luftiges Gebäude aus demselben Material. Es war das Bienenhaus. Doch war es nicht zellenartig und nicht aus Wachs, sondern aus dem Material wie die Ameisenhaufen: Tannennadeln und Waldboden, und nicht kompakt, wie diese Haufen, sondern aufgehängt an feinen Fäden wie in Spinnweben und in mehreren .Etagen übereinander, so dass es aussah wie die Netze, die man im Krieg zur Tarnung über Stellungen hängt. -- Nächste Szene: Auch auf dem Tisch liegt ein Haufen Silbergeld, ein Hund, den ich an der Leine habe, frisst es. Adenauer, der dabei steht, wundert sich. Nächste Szene: Emme und ich liegen im Bett. Emme schläft noch, ich blinzle noch sehr verschlafen.

Andere Szene: Begegnerich (unsere neun Wochen alte Tochter Ilsabe) sitzt mir gegenüber in einem dem meinen gleich grossen Bett, dessen Fussende an das meine grenzt. Sie hat sich aufgerichtet, guckt mich verschmitzt an und spricht mit mir französisch, "il dure longtemps" sagt sie. Sie spricht den Nasal sehr deutsch aus. Ich spreche es ihr vor. Sie wiederholt, jetzt etwa "lun-tomps" mit richtigem Nasal. (247 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1429 (1954-10-17 - Freiburg)Ich erzähle Bender in allen Einzelheiten einen Traum von mir, den er deutet. Darin kommt ein fallender und sinkender und ein verlöschender Stern vor. Bender wird hier sehr ernst und sagt: "Ihre Lage scheint mir gefährlich." Ich spüre in seiner Aussage einen grossen Realismus. Andere Szene: In einem Raum mit einer alten Frau und Gisela. Plötzlich schliesst sich von selbst das Schloss in der Tür zu, die Fenster gehen von selbst zu und die Fensterläden schlagen krachend an. Wir sehen uns mit Entsetzen verzaubert. Die Zeit scheint mit uns in diesem Raum stehen bleiben zu sollen. Aber plötzlich ist Gisela fort. Ihr Stuhl ist leer. Sie scheint scheinbar körperlos durch die geschlossene Tür entwichen. Jetzt springt auch die alte Frau auf, stürzt zum Fenster und kann es zu meinem Erstaunen aufstossen und sich hinausdrücken. Ich eile hinterher, doch merke ich, wie die Fensterläden mit mächtiger Gewalt streben, sich wieder und für immer vor mir zu schliessen. Nur mit äusserster Anspannung gelingt es mir, gerade noch hinter der Frau durch- und hinauszukommen. Andere Szene: Ich traf in Göttingen Ferber in einem Metzgerladen. Er sagte zum Metzger: "21 Mark habe ich noch, geben Sie mir dafür Fleisch." Ferber war offenbar inzwischen verheiratet. Ich stand direkt neben ihm, doch er schien meinen Gruss nicht zu hören. Nach einer Weile aber sagte er plötzlich beiläufig zu mir, ohne den Blick zu wenden, etwas über eine Arbeit, die er noch von mir habe und: "Du kannst ja mal zu uns raufkommen, oder ich bringe sie Dir runter." Dann war wieder langes Schweigen. Meine goldene Uhr, die ich während des Gesprächs in Gedanken auf den Tisch gelegt hatte, wollte der Schlachter, der nicht wusste, wem sie gehörte, an sich nehmen. Ich musste sie ihm entreissen. (289 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1430 (1954-10-18 - Freiburg)Draussen vor dem Fenster, aus dem ich schaue, fährt in breitem, zugleich konservativem und repräsentativem Wagen ein Mann vor, den ich im ersten Moment für Onkel Hans halte, der auch ein bisschen aussieht wie Seekt, dem man aber auf jeden Fall den General sofort ansieht. Er winkt aus dem Wagen und fragt nach meinem Vater. Ich rufe zurück, der sei im Krankenhaus, will ihm noch zurufen: "Arteriosklerose", denn ich weiss, dass es mit meinem Vater schlecht steht, doch er ist schon ausgestiegen, irgendwie über den Gartenzaun gekommen und steht vor meinem breiten Parterrefenster und stellt sich vor: "General-Leutnant Müller" und nennt seine Regimenter. Ich erinnere mich jetzt an ihn aus Schwerin. Der Mann ist auch in Zivil noch absolut der General alten Stils. Er erzählt von sich, dass er Gymastikunterricht geben werde. Während des Gesprächs ist er plötzlich ins Zimmer gelangt. Er muss in seiner elastischen, sportlichen Art durchs Fenster hineingesprungen sein. Mir imponiert die zugleich geistig und körperlich disziplinierte Gestalt. Andere Szene: Ich traf Eli wieder, die ich so lange nicht gesehen und von der ich nichts gehört habe. Sie war in ihrem Wesen und Temperament ganz unverändert. Braune Augen. Ein wenig gewährend selbstverständlich und darin zugleich zuteilend -- wohl das, was man am besten die "Schenkende Tugend" nennt. Es geschah eigentlich kaum etwas. Sie war einfach da. Sie zeigte mir aus irgend einem Anlass ihre weissen Kniestrümpfe. In einer vorhergehenden Szene hatte Ursel Bülow aus Wittmoldt eine Rolle gespielt. (241 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1431 (1954-10-18 - Freiburg)Besuch in einem grossen Haus (das Züge trug zugleich von Kreuzlingen und von dem Knesebeck-Usedomschen-Haus in Schwerin. Ich war dort für einige Tage zu Gast. Dort traf mich Specht. Während er schon im Zimmer war, wo wir plauderten, ging ich raus, weil der Herr der Hauses, er hatte die Gestalt von Onkel Wedig Knesebeck und zugleich Züge von Binswanger, die Treppe hinaufkam. Er nahm mich mit in sein Zimmer, um sich mit mir zu unterhalten (in einer ähnlichen Art wie Binswanger). Er sagte mir, dass er mich mitnehmen wolle nach Hamburg zu Professor Martin (der im Traum als Psychologe und in Hamburg figurierte). Dort solle ein pädagogisches Diagramm von mir gemacht werden, in dem man die pädagogische Fähigkeit prüfen könne. Dann kam wieder jemand die Treppe rauf. Es war ein sehr vertrauter Freund. Ich erzählte ihm, ihn in das Zimmer zu dem alten Herrn mitnehmend, dass übrigens auch Specht da sei. Er zeigte sich merkwürdig wenig davon beeindruckt, was mich wunderte, denn er musste Specht aus unserer gemeinsamen Zeit gut kennen. Erwachen. Als ich mir beim Erwachen überlegte, wer eigentlich der mir sehr vertraute Freund war, der zuletzt die Treppe heraufgekommen war, wurde mir klar, dass er ebenfalls niemand anders als Specht selber war. Die Gestalt Spechts kam also in dem Traum zweimal gleichsam nebeneinander vor, ohne dass ich es im Traum bemerkt hätte. Nur das Verwundern, dass der eine vom anderen so wenig Notiz nahm. (236 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1432 (1954-10-19 - Freiburg)[im Dunkeln geschrieben] Traum um das Wort Ichthys. Einzelheiten vergessen. Vorher andere Szene. In eine Familie. Mann mit Beinprothese, deren Verlängerung gleichsam wie die Verlängerung eines Uhrzeigers über die Mittelachse, so hier über die Hüfte hinausragte, so dass er damit wie mit einem Hebel das Bein mit der Hand dirigieren konnte. Sein Sohn, mit dem ich eigentlich zu tun hatte (ich weiss nicht, ob er mein Schüler war, oder wir zusammen arbeiteten) musste wegen irgend einer dringenden, etwas dramatischen Sache plötzlich weg, so dass ich mich mit dem Vater beschäftigen musste, den ich bei seinem durch die Prothese erschwerten Gang im Zimmer stützte. Später mit Emme vor der Tür des Hauses. Das Auto kam sehr senkrecht durch die schmale Gartentür und einen steilen Hang so hochgefahren, dass Emme und ich zur Seite springen mussten. Die Haustür wurde ausgehoben und zu einer Reparatur fortbefördert. (140 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1433 (1954-10-20 - Freiburg)Traf Binswanger auf der Strasse. Wir begegneten uns auf einer Verkehrsinsel vor der Universität. Ich erkannte ihn zunächst nicht. Er hatte einen steifen runden Hut auf, ein runderes Gesicht, sah etwas jünger aus und ein wenig amerikanisch, städtisch. Dieser Mann stand neben mir auf der Verkehrsinsel und schaute mich grüssend an. Ich sah ihn an und zögerte noch, dann kam langsam das Erkennen und ich sagte: "Binswanger?" Im Laufe des Gesprächs, das sich entwickelte, erkannte ich ihn immer mehr an der Stimme und Sprechweise, vor allem auch an der Gestik. Wir sprachen darüber, warum ich ihn nicht erkannt hätte, und ich sagte, es fehle der Schlapphut und die Haare seien zurückgekämmt. Die nächste Szene spielte in Kreuzlingen in der Anstalt. Hitler war dort als Patient, doch zugleich noch irgendwie Herrscher. Die Räumlichkeit im Traum war zugleich die der Anstalt und doch seine Kanzlei. Es war wie in einer Zwei- Szenen-Bühne. Ich musste ihm aus seinem Manifest vorlesen. Doch kam es gar nicht erst dazu, weil er in einem Anfall von Wahnsinn sich auf mich stürzte, mich mit einer Schere und einem Schraubenschlüssel bedrohte. Ich entwand ihm beides und beruhigte ihn, er war inzwischen ein kleiner Junge geworden, etwa von fünf oder sechs Jahren, und ich brachte ihn in eine Art Jungenszimmer der Anstalt, wo er über die anderen Jungen herrschte. Ich hatte meinen Arm auf dem Weg über die Treppe um seine Schultern gelegt und so ihn allmählich ganz beruhigt und sein Vertrauen wieder gewonnen. Der Übergang zwischen Hitler als Despoten und Hitler als Patienten deutete sich übrigens im Anfang der Szene kurz an durch Hitler als Arzt, denn ich sagte zu ihm: "Hier sind Sie nicht Staatsoberhaupt, sondern Arzt", damit gegen seine Machtwünsche polemisierend. Doch während des Beginns meines Vorlesens wurde er schon zum Patienten. Die ganze Szene spielte bei Tisch in einem grossen Essraum. Es gab viele schöne Speisen. Andere Gäste, unter denen auch der Ostpreusse, Herr v. N., war, erstaunten über die Vielzahl der Gänge, wo sie zu jedem ihre Serviette wieder neu auseinander rollen mussten, weil sie den vorhergehenden für den letzten gehalten hatten. Auch das blonde Mädchen, mit dem ich in Kreuzlingen getanzt habe, spielte eine Rolle. Man sah sie auf einem Prospekt in einem Liegestuhl liegend (als Bild des Komforts der Anstalt). (378 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1434 (1954-10-21 - Freiburg)Traum von "Begegnerich" (unserem elf Wochen alten Töchterchen Ilsabe). Sie konnte auf einmal nicht nur ihren Kopf heben, sondern sogar vom Bett, auf dem sie mit ihrem Kissen lag, herunterkriechen und über den Fussboden zu mir in anderem Bett hinüberkriechen. (40 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1435 (1954-10-22 - Freiburg)Ich war gestorben und existierte nur noch in vier gelb-orangenen Bildern aus knisterigem Papier (wie die, die ich in den letzten Wochen mit blauer, und roter Tinte -- gestern zum ersten Mal --, bemalt habe). Ich war wirklich da in diesen Bildern, sah ins Zimmer, und alles, aber ich selbst war gestorben. (52 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1436 (1954-10-23 - Freiburg)Begegnerich war etwa acht oder neun Jahre alt. Sie war trotzig und wollte aus dem Zimmer herauslaufen. Sie hatte eine Baskenmütze auf und war sehr nett angezogen -- überhaupt ein richtiges Mädchen. Ich rief sie an der Tür - einer plötzlichen Eingebung folgend -- nicht wie üblich mit dem Namen Ilsabe, sondern mit ihrem anderen Namen Manuela zurück. Sie kehrte sofort um. -- Das eigentlich Frappierende an solchen Träumen, das sich kaum wiedergeben lässt, ist die völlige Identität der Figur im Traum mit dem jetzt elf Wochen alten Säugling. Diese spürt man noch im Erwachen, und das ist das eigentlich Faszinierende am Traum. (103 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1437 (1954-10-23 - Freiburg)Mit Emme in einem Hotel. Wir waren in einer Nische oder Halle des Flures, die nur durch einen Vorhang halb von diesem abgetrennt war, nackt, und spielten miteinander. Es war Nacht, doch hörten wir plötzlich Schritte auf dem Flur und ich sagte zu Emme: "Zieh Deinen Bademantel an". Doch sie stieg mit den Beinen in die Ärmel und kam darum nicht zu Rande. Über dem war schon auf dem Flur eine Frau herangekommen. Es war eine Italienerin oder Griechin, die aber ganz unbefangen war, sofort herzu trat und erzählte, in solchen Situationen sei sie auch schon oft gewesen. Dann gab sie uns praktische Ratschläge, was man im Bett tun könne. (110 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1438 (1954-10-25 - Freiburg)Traum um Karl Jaspers. Ich las den Druck eines Vortrags, den ich von ihm gehört hatte. Dort war in sehr origineller Weise die Fortsetzung eines Satzes durch eine Gebärde zeichnerisch angedeutet und zwar brach die Zeile ab mit diesem Bild (hier im handschriftlichen Manuskript eine Zeichnung von einem im Kreis nach unten weisenden Pfeil, der auf eine weggeworfene rauchende Zigarette weist). Eine zu Boden geworfenen Zigarette, oder viel mehr die wegwerfende Bewegung selbst, angedeutet durch die Linie der Wurfkurve. So hatte er einen Satz in dem Vortrag durch diese etwas abschätzige Gebärde beendet, ohne ihn zu Ende zu sprechen. Mir schien dieser Zug charakteristisch für ihn. Mir imponierte in gewisser Weise die Präzision der Gestik. (115 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1439 (1954-10-25 - Freiburg)Anderer Traum um Gisela: Ich traf sie in einem Lokal am Jungfernstieg in Hamburg, wo sie auf Franz wartete. (Es war im Traum so, als ob sie mit ihm und nicht mit Peter verheiratet sei). Sie wandte mir während des Gesprächs den Rücken zu, woraus ich entnahm, wie starke Spannung ihr Verhältnis zu mir immer noch hatte. So nahm ich es als ein positives Zeichen. Wir verliessen dann zusammen das Lokal. Gisela wollte später zu der Zeit, wo Franz sie dort suchte, zurückkehren -- und wir gingen hinaus an die Alster. (91 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1440 (1954-10-25 - Freiburg)Anderer Traum mitten in der Nacht (also vor den beiden schon aufgeschriebenen Morgenträumen). Ich ging bei dem warmen Föhnwetter trotz des Spätherbstes barfuss in meinen ganz leichten Sandalen und mit kurzen Hosen. Irgendwelche Leute auf der Strasse (Männer, wohl Strassenarbeiter) mockierten sich darüber, und einer sagte sehr laut und ironisch: "So was habe ich ja noch nie gesehen". Ich antwortete ebenso laut: "So einen flegelhaften Unerzogenen habe ich noch nie gesehen". Er war darauf betroffen, und ich fühlte grosse Genugtuung. Die Atmosphäre und das Klima des Traums waren wie in Freiburg während des gerade herrschenden Föhns. Die Strassen glichen aber den Strassen Schwerins, nämlich die, durch die ich mit dem Rad hindurchfuhr, die Strasse am Pfaffenteich, die zu unserer Schule führte. Diese wollte ich jetzt betreten. Es war schon etwas zu spät. Die grossen Holztore waren schon geschlossen. Ich überlegte mir, ob ich ganz umkehren und mich umziehen sollte, weil ich wusste, dass man in der Schule etwas gegen gewagte Kleidung war (denn jetzt im Spätherbst war sie aussergewöhnlich, obwohl es durch den Föhn tatsächlich ganz warm war), aber ich entschloss mich, doch hineinzugehen, stiess die Tür auf und schob mein Rad hinein. Drinnen bei dem Fahrradständer fand ich meinen Klassenkameraden Detlev Hollmann. (203 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1441 (1954-10-27 - Freiburg)Eine Frau mit einer hysterischen Beinlähmung. Ein Psychotherapeut, wohl C. G. Jung, versucht sie wieder zu einem langsamen, sehr vorsichtigen Gehen zu bringen. Ich begegne ihr auf dem Weg und sage ihr, sie solle hüpfen wie ein Pferd, und mache ihr galoppierende und trabende Bewegungen vor. Sie wird unmittelbar davon angesteckt und kann auf einmal auch ausgelassen springen. Dann wandelt sich die Szene: Sie sitzt auf einem Pferd und wird mir jetzt bedrohlich. Den Fortgang dieser Szene habe ich vergessen. (80 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1442 (1954-11-01 - Freiburg)Traum mitten in der Nacht: Wir hatten draussen auf dem Boden einen gelben Kanarienvogel. Ich wachte nachts auf, mit dem Gefühl, dass es für den Vogel viel zu kalt war, rannte hinaus und fand ihn auf seiner Stange sitzend mit einem merkwürdig grauen Belag auf dem Kopf. Ich sagte zu Emme: "Das kommt von der Kälte." Sie antwortete: "Nein, er hat bloss Schorf auf dem Kopf." Erwachen von kalter Luft, die durch das Fenster hineinkam. (75 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1443 (1954-11-01 - Freiburg)In derselben Nacht gegen Morgen Traum: Ich war mit Emmes Schwester Gärdle im Bett und spielte mit meinen Händen um ihre Glieder. Ich sagte ihr, sie sei Emme in allen Stücken sehr ähnlich. Sie wollte es nicht ganz wahrhaben, doch ich meinte, sie solle das lieber pflegen. Emme hatte übrigens noch eine jüngere zweite Schwester, die im Hintergrund heimlich ihre kräftigen Brüste enthüllte. (63 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1444 (1954-11-02 - Freiburg)Wir hatten Besuch von Fräulein S. Während sie in ihrer etwas originellen, manchmal etwas verhaltenen Art plauderte, kam die Baumgärtnerin herein, wie üblich mit tausend Wünschen, Bitten und Fragen, mit denen sie ziemlich rücksichtslos in das Gespräch hereinplatzte. Fräulein S. war dadurch verwirrt, stand auf und verabschiedete sich. Ich sagte, "bleiben Sie doch wenigstens noch einen Augenblick" und versuchte, die Baumgärtnerin loszuwerden. Doch diese stand stur in der Tür und redete. Ich ärgerte mich sehr und erwachte. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1445 (1954-11-03 - Freiburg)Traum gegen Morgen: In einer Art Unterrichtsstunde ging es offenbar darum, Griechisch zu übersetzen.

Ich genierte mich, denn ich hatte als Lesezeichen Illustrierten-Ausschnitte von nackten oder wenig angezogenen Frauen hineingelegt. (48 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1446 (1954-11-03 - Freiburg)Traum mitten in der Nacht: Besuch von Bambi, Dolo und Hf.: Wir reden mit ihnen über ein mythisches Thema: Die Saat, und jeder hat etwas beizusteuern, was alles man früher in magischer Absicht in die Erde gesteckt habe, damit es sich vermehre, Eingeweide, aus denen Eingeweide wuchsen, usw. Ich sagte plötzlich: "Wenn man sich vorstellt, wir würden unsere Zigarettenasche in die Erde tun" (wir rauchten gerade, und es stand viel Asche herum) "und lauter Zigaretten würden aus dem Boden spriessen". Dies schien sehr anstössig zu sein, denn Bambi erhob sich sofort und schickte sich an zum Gehen. Dolo machte das Selbe, und auch Hf. stand langsam auf mit etwas väterlicher Miene. Als Bambi und Dolo schon in der Tür standen, das Gesicht noch ins Zimmer gewandt, eilte ich ihnen nach, nahm ihre Gesichter in meine beiden Hände und redete ihnen gut zu, was denn eigentlich schlimmer sei, wenn Eingeweide aus der Erde wüchsen oder Zigaretten. Mir war dabei der ihnen unbewusste Grund ihrer Empörung durchaus klar, es war die phallische Symbolbedeutung der Zigaretten. Sie hielten beide inne. Jetzt folgt eine Zeichnung, wo zwei Köpfen zwischen zwei Händen zu sehen sind und daneben die Worte: so etwa hielt ich ihre Köpfe in meinen Händen. (203 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1447 (1954-11-05 - Freiburg)Brief von Gisela, der als Absender angibt: "jeden Abend in der Altmeierstrasse" und den Ort, in dem wir wohnen. Das Ganze geschrieben wie eine Adresse. Aus ihrem Brief geht hervor, dass sie dort bei zwei Tanten ist, die sich nicht einig sind und bei denen es wenig angenehm ist. Ich habe vor, ihr vorzuschlagen, doch bei uns zu schlafen im dritten Bett, das in dem Raum steht. Finde, dass sie das nicht abschlagen darf, wo sie in derselben Stadt ist. Ich dachte erst, als ich ihren Absender sah, sie würde jeden Abend in der Strasse auf und ab gehen. (99 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1448 (1954-11-06 - Freiburg)Ich bin in Gefangenschaft in der Schweiz, dicht an der Grenze -- es ist in Kreuzlingen, ausgerechnet in der Schweiz, diesem so friedliebenden Land, in Gefangenschaft. Auch Frau P. ist dort. Sie hat eine Säge, die ich vorsichtig fortnehme, weil sie in Gefahr ist, sich damit das Leben zu nehmen. Ich soll für sie in einem grossen Saal, dessen Räumlichkeit an die Räume von Binswangers Bellevue erinnert, die Abfahrtszeiten der Bodensee-Fähre nachsehen. Aber in dem Saal ist irgend eine feierliche Veranstaltung, so dass ich nicht dazu komme. Viele alte Bücher liegen da, in Schweinsleder gebunden. Viele Einzelheiten, die auch von anderen Mitgefangenen handelten, habe ich vergessen. Situationen und Menschen wie in den russischen Gefangenenlagern. Man sieht drüben auf deutscher Seite den Schwarzwald, so wie man ihn von der Schweizer Grenze am Hochrhein aus sieht (Eindrücke unserer letzten Fahrt nach Zürich zur Van Gogh Ausstellung). Erwachen. Dabei ist es schon klar, dass wir entlassen werden. (154 words)

Die Bahn fährt an Anlegestellen draussen vor der Stadt. Andere Szene: Herr Kehr, mein Wirt (Göttingen) sagt, ich solle ihn nicht jedes Mal grüssen, wenn ich in die Wohnung komme, dass sei auch im Generalstab nicht üblich. Andere Szene: Es ist Krieg. Ich habe eine Feldpostnummer. Ich stelle fest, dass man an der Front vierstellige Feldpostnummern hat, in der Etappe fünfstelllige. Meine ist vierstellig.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1450 (1954-11-09 - Freiburg)Vielfältiger Traum, aus dem mir nur noch einzelne Fäden in Erinnerung sind: Die Baumgärtnerin wollte ihr "grünes Zimmer" an den Psychiater Dr. Kuhn vermieten. Er sollte, glaube ich, 84.- Mark dafür bezahlen. Das kam heraus, als ich erzählte, dass eine Mietpreissenkung vorgesehen sei. Ich war empört über die hohe Summe. Emme hatte irgend eine Entzündung. Ich überlegte, dass es das Beste sei, einfach Penizillin zu spritzen. Ika war auch da und wusch im Treppenhaus ihre Pullover. Emme und ich suchten eine leere Wohnung, offenbar in Göttingen (hiermit im Zusammenhang später auch die Szene zwischen der Baumgärtnerin und Dr. Kuhn). Mein Bruder schickte uns für die Wohnung eine barocke Boule-Uhr und ein kleines Radio, das ich Emme, die im Bett lag, vorspielte. Sie war irgendwie erstaunt darüber. Auch einen Schrank wollte er uns in einem Päckchen schicken. Kollegen von ihm spielten eine Rolle (anscheinend Ärzte -- er ist aber Jurist). Sie kamen aus Jena. Dies stand wieder in Zusammenhang mit einer Schiller-Tagung, bei der ich gewesen war. -- Nach alledem und dem Gespräch mit der Baumgärtnerin und Dr. Kuhn kam ich wieder heraus zu Ika, die immer noch ihre Pullover wusch. Sie hatte ein leuchtendes Blau darunter, das mich sehr beeindruckte. Sie musste den ganzen Tag von Morgens bis in den späten Nachmittag gewaschen haben. Offenbar hatte sie ihre ganzen Pullover in Australien nicht gewaschen und holte es nun nach. (229 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1453 (1954-11-16 - Freiburg)Zwei spitzwinklig zueinander laufende Strassen, die einen grossen Umweg erfordern. Dazwischen ein Abhang, der Park sein muss. Oder ist das Tor ein Privateingang? Ich erkenne, dass man unten auf die andere Strasse gelangen kann, und sehe Dolo auf dem Wege, sich in dem Park zu sonnen. Sie hat braune Beine, aber sehr blasse Schultern. Ich will mich auch sonnen, und sehe -- an dem Tor stehend -- dass ich nur eine dünne schwarze Turnhose anhabe, die durchsichtig ist und das aufgerichtete Glied durchscheinen lässt. Ich ziehe darum, so lange ich auf der Strasse bin, die rote Steppdecke, die ich um die Schultern liegen haben, fester an mich heran. Andere Szene: Mit Emme in einem Parfumgeschäft. Ich sage über ein Parfum von Dior, das sehr stark nach Lilien riecht, dass, während sonst schreiende Gerüche nicht schön seien, dieser mir sehr zusage. Die Flasche ist in der Form einer Empire-Vase gebildet. Zum Schluss sagt die Verkäuferin, dass die Gummihüte, die ich neulich für das Männlein gekauft habe, sicher viel zu gross seien und sie mir darum extra passende anfertigen wolle. (178 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1454 (1954-11-19 - Freiburg)Beschaue mit unserer Emmi Bilder von sehr schönen Landschaften und Aussichten. Dann sind wir selbst an einem alten Gebäude, von dem aus eine sehr schöne Aussicht ist, wenn man eine sehr hohe Leiter hinaufsteigt, die aussen an der Mauer lehnt. Als wir oben sind, wird es schon dämmrig. Unten dehnt sich ein weites Plateau. An der Seite sieht man die erleuchteten Fenster kleiner Schwebebahnen, die langsam zum Berggipfel über und hinter dem Haus hinaufschweben. Beim Blick hinab in die Tiefe wird mir schwindlig. Die Leiter steht sehr locker an die Hauswand angelehnt bei einem Sims oder einer Brüstung, ist nicht befestigt und macht ausserdem einen Knick, weil einfach zwei Leitern sehr provisorisch aneinander angestütckt sind. Auch Emmi wird es unheimlich, denn dort, wo wir an der Hauswand hocken, hängt eine Hose aus Blech oder Stein, aus irgend einem harten Material, die ihr nicht geheuer ist. Sie spricht es zuerst aus, ob wir nicht hinabsteigen wollen. Mir ist das sehr recht. Sie sagt: "Wenn ich zuerst hinabsteige, fällt Dir die Hose auf den Kopf". Zu ergänzen ist natürlich: Wenn sie fällt, was auch sie nicht ernstlich glaubt. So lasse ich sie zuerst steigen und betrete erst die sehr wacklige Leiter, die besonders am Knick, der Verbindungsstelle, sich sehr einbiegt, als sie schon fast unten ist. Was ich befürchtete, als ich den Knick übersteige, trifft ein: Die Leiter kommt ins Rutschen und stürzt herab. Ich habe vorsichtshalber schon einen Maurerhaken ergriffen, der in dieser Höhe an der Mauer hängt -- und nach einem Augenblick des Schwebens gelingt es mir, auf einer sehr hohen Trittleiter Fuss zu fassen, die dort steht. Ich klettere ihre Stufen hinab, doch führt sie nicht bis hinunter zum Boden, sondern die Stufen gehen irgendwo in steile Stangen über. Zum Herabspringen ist es noch zu hoch. Emmi steht unten. Ich erwache bei dem Gedanken, ob ich versuchen soll, irgendwo auf ein Fenstersims zu gelangen, um vielleicht durch das scheinbar leerstehende Haus hinabzugelangen. Dieser Gedanke spinnt sich im Halbwachen weiter aus, ob vielleicht unten die Tür verschlossen ist, dass Emmi das vielleicht vorher nachsehen soll, etc. (346 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1455 (1954-11-23 - Freiburg)In französischer Umgebung (etwa wie Gefangenenlager). Eine deutsche bedienstete alte Frau hat zum Kuchen backen "Mehl" aus Tüten genommen, die mir in die Hände fallen. Sie sehen zwar aus wie amerikanische Flower-Tüten, aus deren Mehl zu backen sie gewohnt ist, aber es steht etwas anderes darauf. Mir fällt zuerst das Wort "sleeping" auf und bei der näheren Entzifferung merke ich - und andere, unter ihnen Gregor, die besser englisch können, bestätigen -, die Tüten enthielten Schlafpulver in grösseren Mengen, das aussieht wie Mehl. Daher sind alle in dem Lager, einschliesslich der Franzosen, merkwürdig schläfrig. Die Frau behauptet, es sei Mehl gewesen. Sie kann kein Englisch und sieht den Unterschied der Tüten nicht. Auch ist sie merkwürdig dumm und stupide. Ich frage sie aus, ob die Tüten vielleicht offen gewesen seien, so dass es möglich ist, dass in sie doch richtiges Mehl gefüllt gewesen wäre. Sie macht Ausflüchte und windet sich um die Antwort, doch schliesslich muss sie zugeben, dass die Tüten noch richtig verschlossen waren. Ich will nun das Lager alarmieren. Erwachen. Die Frau hatte auch zwei Hunde. (178 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1456 (1954-11-23 - Freiburg)Andere Träume heute Nacht: Fuhr auf Schienen auf einen kleinen, zweirädrigen und leichten Wagen (wie Traberwagen), der von einem Frosch gezogen wurde, den ich an zwei Bändern wie an Zügeln hatte. Ein Mann, der die Bahn beaufsichtigte, traute der Zugkraft des Frosches nicht, und setzte darum ihn und das Gefährt mit mir ins Wasser, an dessen Ufer die Bahn entlang lief. Es war ein See, am Rande aber kanalartig. Dort zog mich der Frosch nun mit grosser Geschwindigkeit in seinem Element. Dabei aber verwickelten sich aber allmählich die Zügel, so dass ich zwar ihn lenken konnte, sie aber immer kürzer wurden, so dass ich mit den Händen schliesslich ganz am Frosch war, aus dem ausserdem hinten ein merkwürdiges Gebilde hervorkam, wie Blätter, oder ein zweiter kleiner Frosch? So konnte ich schliesslich die Zügel nicht mehr halten, weil die Hände keine Distanz mehr vom Frosch hatten. Doch waren wir auch am Ziel angekommen, und ich hatte die Reise ebenso schnell geschafft wie die anderen auf den Schienen. (166 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1457 (1954-11-23 - Freiburg)Mit Emme in einer Wohnung im hohen Stockwerk über einem See oder Gewässer. Fenster, die wie auf Schlössern, bis zum Boden gehen. Links ein Mauervorsprung und Fenster, in das man hineinsehen kann, wenn man ganz auf den Sims unseres Fensters hinaustritt und sich dann an Stangen hält, die das andere Fenster vergittern. Das tun wir und sehen in die Nachbarwohnung: Hohe, lichtvolle Atelierfenster: die Wohnung eines Tänzers, die uns erfreut. Emme kann beim Weg in unser Fenster auf dem Sims das Gleichgewicht nicht halten, kommt ins Schwanken und sieht sich schliesslich zum Absprung gezwungen. Sie schwebt ganz langsam und gleichsam lässig ohne Angst in die Tiefe hinab auf das Wasser zu, in das sie schliesslich eintaucht, um kurze Zeit später wohlbehalten wieder daraus aufzutauchen. Ich stand während dieses Vorgangs oben dabei, ohne noch eingreifen zu können, weil jetzt nur noch das Gewicht der Schwerkraft galt, war aber fasziniert von der Selbstverständlichkeit und Unreflektiertheit, mit der sie hinabschwebte, und gleichzeitig in Sorge, ob das Wasser tief genug sei. Doch es war tief genug, um sie mühelos wieder auftauchen zu lassen. (179 words)

So eine barocke, sehr schöne Anima Mundi und eine Retorte mit einem Baby drin, ein wenig im Empire-Stil schon.

Unten waren noch einige andere Figuren -- jede nur so hoch wie eines der Bretter breit wäre. (73 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1460 (1954-12-05 - Freiburg)Ländliche Maschinerie, die durch einen einzigen Griff eine riesige Strohmiete umzuwenden vermochte, und zwar wurde die ganze quadratische Miete mit festen Brettern umfasst und wie durch einen Kran, wohl mit Seilen, in die Höhe gehoben, dort gekippt und auf einer der Schmalseiten aufgestellt, um dann erneut gehoben, in der Luft gewendet und auf der anderen Schmalseite abgestellt zu werden. Doch musste ich hierzu diesmal auf einem schrägen Abhang stehen, in der Gefahr, umzustürzen. Deswegen offenbar wurde ein schwerer Dampftrecker, mit dessen Kraft wohl das Ganze gehoben wurde, und den ich bisher nicht gesehen hatte, von seinem Platz hinter der Miete hervorgezogen und seitlich aufgestellt, um durch sein Gewicht sie auf der schrägen Ebene vor dem Stürzen zu bewahren. Doch gelang dies nicht. Ich sah, wie sie sich langsam neigte, und dabei noch auf die halboffene Türe eines Holzhauses zu stürzen drohte, in dem die Arbeiter waren. Ein Arbeiter in blauem Monteurkittel schaute gerade aus der Tür auf den Vorgang. Als er bemerkte, wie die Miete auf ihn zu sich neigte und ihn in der Tür zu verklemmen drohte, war er geistesgegenwärtig genug, die Tür erst noch ein wenig mehr zu öffnen, um sich überhaupt durch sie wieder zurückziehen zu können, und dies gelang ihm auch. Er schloss die Tür hinter sich, ehe die Miete gestürzt war. (216 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1465 (1954-12-15 - Freiburg)In den letzten Tagen vergass ich immer wieder meine Träume -- als ob ein starker Wille sich gegen die Niederschrift stemme. Nur einer blieb mir in Erinnerung: Ich war in Roggow nach dem Kriege -- als Oertzens schon nicht mehr im dem Gutshaus wohnten. Heimlich ging ich durch das von Familien bewohnte Haus und stieg schliesslich auf das relativ flache Dach. Dort waren noch zwei Räume aufgebaut, in denen die Büros von Firmen waren, die jetzt in dem Haus untergebracht waren. Ich ging vorbei und versuchte, auf dem rechten Flügel (über dem ehemaligen Schlafzimmer von Oertzens) wieder durch eine grosse geöffnete Luke einzusteigen. Kam dabei aber auf der linken Seite in Gefahr, auf einem schmalen Dachstreifen zwischen dem geöffneten Lukendeckel und dem Dachsims abzustürzen. Ich hätte von rechts an die Klappe herangehen müssen, fühlte mich aber so schwindlig, dass ich nicht zurückzugehen wagte. Die Sekretärin aus dem ersten Dachhäusschen hatte inzwischen ihre Arbeit beendet -- es war Feierabend -- und zeigte der aus dem zweiten Dachhäusschen, die offenbar zum ersten Mal hier für ihre Firma arbeitete, im Fortgehen noch das Dach und seine Anlage. Ich rief beide, die nun richtig von rechts an die Klappe herankamen, um Hilfe. Sie reichten mir eine Hand, und ich konnte nun über den Lukendeckel hinweg in die Öffnung steigen und erwachte.

Als ich wieder heraus kam, war er fast leer. Eine Frau erzählte mir aufgeregt, alle Passanten hätten sich Äpfel genommen, manche vier auf einmal, die ganzen Taschen vollgestopft. Ich war empört. Die nächsten Szenen handelten von einem Mann, der jetzt wohl der Täter des Apfelstehlens war. Er drohte schliesslich mit einem Falschirmjägermesser -- aber ich schlug ihm mit dem Knauf von Emmes Falschirmjägermesser auf den Kopf. Auch ein Hund war da in einem Stall. Er musste mich kennen und biss mich doch. Ich rief ihm zu: "Du kennst mich doch". In der letzten Szene war aus dem Mann ein Mädchen geworden, leidenschaftlich und schön, mit dem ich ins Bett gehen wollte. (128 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1468 (1954-12-17 - Freiburg)Onkel Deti (mein Patenonkel, Detlev v. Bülow) zeigte uns an den Wänden des Zimmers Bilder, die er gemalt hatte und die neugeborene Kinder seiner Neffen und Nichten und Verwandten und Bekannten allegorisch darstellten. Er zeigte sie sehr liebevoll. Es waren allegorische Figuren mit Vogelköpfen und ähnlichem -- am ehesten an die Bilder Chagalls erinnernd. Eines hatte er gerade heute gemacht auf eine Postkarte hin, die die Geburt eines Kindes anzeigte. Sein Bruder sagte ein wenig ironisch zu der Zeichnung: "Na, das ist ja schnell gegangen". Dann zeigte uns Deti viele Teppiche, die er geknüpft hatte. Sie waren in geheimnisvollen Farben und verhaltenen Figuren, die man nur gleichsam im zweiten Blick erkannte und die merkwürdig in ihre Elemente zerstückt waren (wie die Bilder van Goghs). Sie waren schön, doch sprang der Unterschied zu unserem eigenen Teppich -- mit hergebrachtem Persermuster -- kaum heraus. Detis Teppiche waren wie Vexierbilder. Wir setzten uns zu Tisch, auch Gregor und der "holländische Doktor aus Kreuzlingen " (ein Patient, aber, was Gregor nicht wusste) waren dabei. Das Gespräch kam auf die Teppiche. Deti erzählte von dem "Amtall" (offenbar einer Teppichknüpfanstalt, wo er sie gemacht habe). Die Leute aus aller Herren Länder, auch Neger, seien dort. Gregor fragte, ob die Arbeiten benotet wurden. Statt Detis sagte schnell der Holländer in seiner stillen und zuvorkommenden Art: "Nein, nein". Gregor wusste, dass wir aus Kreuzlingen kamen und fragte, ob auch dort die Arbeiten (in der Werkstatt, wo die Patienten Teppiche knüpfen) nicht benotet würden. Der holländische Doktor sagte wieder: "Nein, nein". Gregor, der weder ihn noch Deti (von dem es mir inzwischen längst klar geworden war) für Patienten hielt, sprach unbefangen irgend etwas von "den Verrückten". Deti stand auf und ging hinaus. Frau v. Bülow sagte: "Du musst nichts aus dem Gespräch auf dich beziehen". Erwachen. Ich überlegte noch im Erwachen, ob ich nicht nachgehen und ihn zurückholen sollte. (310 words)

So kamen wir von hinten an das "Kornhaus" gleichsam die Fassade aus dem ehemaligen Inneren erblickend. Ich war erfreut in dem Wiedererkennen dieses mir von Aussen so wohlbekannten Bauwerks. Zur Rechten, wenn man auf das "Kornhaus" sah, lag die Fassade einer klassisch-barocken Kirche. Eine ebensolche schloss im Rücken den Platz. Zwischen beiden, als wir uns wendeten, hatten wir einen Durchblick auf das Schiefe Tor, das schon bedenklich zur Seite geneigt nur stehenblieb, weil es auf den Nachbargebäuden Halt gefunden hatte. Ich erklärte Emme, dass dies eine Folge des Sinkens des Schlammsees sei, auf den die Stadt gebaut ist. Ein vorbeikommender junger Mann korrigierte meine Rede: "Nicht auf dem Schlammsee sei die Stadt gebaut, sondern auf die auf ihm ruhende Sohle." Er zog uns im Gespräch mit eine Treppe herunter, die zwischen den beiden Kirchen hinabführte -- wie im Stadtbild von Minden -- und vor dem Schiefen Tor in einem Brücklein mündete, unter dem ein Bach hinfloss.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1474 (1955-01-02 - Freiburg)Ging mit Emme durch eine Stadt. Breite Strasse wie in Randgebiet einer Grosstadt. Über uns sehr tief mächtiges Flugzeug mit drei Motoren, die wie drei Rümpfe wirken. Es lässt am Strick eine Bombe herab -- so vorsichtig, dass sie den Boden berührt, ohne zu detonieren. Ich bemerke, dass das aussieht, wie wenn ein Kind sein Würstle fallen lässt. Dann ein anderes Flugzeug ohne Motor trudelt im Sturzflug herab, fängt sich im letzten Moment und landet in einer schmalen Strasse, wobei es beide Flügel fallen lässt, um nicht mit ihnen an den Häuserwänden anzuecken. Die Landung gelingt sehr elegant. Ich betrachte den flügellosen Rumpf, der aussieht wie ein Boot, während der Pilot -- ein Amateur - mir das Manöver erklärt. Andere Segelflieger kommen hinzu, unter ihnen der Bildhauer Engeling, den ich mit den Anderen begrüsse. Er erklärt mir, dass er im Vorstadtgelände üben werde und fordert mich auf, dort hinzukommen. Ich steige auf das Trittbrett einer Strassenbahn, um mich ein Stück weit mitnehmen zu lassen, ohne zu bezahlen. Der Schaffner fordert mich auf, entweder hereinzukommen, oder abzuspringen, doch ich argumentiere dagegen, dass die Geschwindigkeit mir ein Abspringen nicht mehr erlaube. Er nimmt ein wenig verschmitzt die Argumentation an und lässt mich. Doch in diesem Moment kommt ein Lastauto aus der Seitenstrasse und verringert ebenso wenig seine Geschwindigkeit wie die Bahn. Ich sehe den Zusammenstoss von meinem Trittbrett aus unmittelbar bevorstehen, doch die Bahn vermag, trotz ihrer Geleise, ein wenig auszuweichen und der Kraftwagen ein wenig zu bremsen. So kommen wir vorbei. Ich springe dann ab und gelange über die Schweriner Schlossbrücke an das Seeufer der Anastasiastrasse. Der Dom (eigentlich im Stadtinnern) steht dort unmittelbar an der Uferstrasse (wie schon in früheren Träumen). Im Weitergehen gerate ich vor das Schaufenster einer sehr stilsicheren Töpferei. Hier entdecke ich neben den altbekannten Tonkrügen stilvolle Tontiere mit gestreifter Glasur, die zugleich in ein kristallinisches Gestein von dunklem Glanze übergehen. Ein neuer Lehrling, den die bisher allein arbeitende Meisterin angenommen hat, muss sie gemacht haben. Er -- ein Junge noch -- erscheint hinter dem Schaufenster, während seine Freunde mit mir draussen stehen, und spricht mit einem ein wenig abwesenden und verführerischen Mädchen in weissem Kleid, dessen Brüste fast unmerkbar enthüllt sind. Während beide noch reden, erscheint in einer Tür im Hintergrund ein blutvolles, lebhaftes Mädchen, mit roten, ein wenig feuchten Lippen und viel Temperament, das auch mir schon als Sibylle aus der Töpferei bekannt ist. Endlich kommt auch von draussen eine Frauengestalt -- ebenfalls in weissem Arbeitsmantel - , um die Freunde des Jungen mit Kuchen und Getränken zu bewirten. Auch ich werde versehentlich dazu gezählt, obwohl ich nur mit am Schaufenster stehe. Mir ist das peinlich. Erwachen. (Emme ruft im Bett, ich sei fortgelaufen und habe alle meine Sachen, auch den blauen Stein und die kleine Nuss im Käfig, mitgenommen. Davon bin ich aufgewacht und beruhige sie. Sie hatte vorher geträumt, dass sie mit Ilsabe nackt durch die Stadt ginge und Blumen für die Baumgärtnerin trüge.) (491 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1475 (1955-01-05 - Freiburg)Ich bin mit Emme ins Bett gegangen. Hermhaus kommt zu Besuch, ehe wir fertig sind. Doch er legt in seiner frischen Art Hut und Mantel ab und sagt: "Lassen Sie sich nicht stören, Herrschaften" und geht raus und macht sich auf dem Flur zu schaffen. Dann wechselt die Szene: Ich stehe vor dem Bett, halb als Arzt, und habe einen -- wohl fingierten -- Anruf entgegengenommen, dass Emme -- als die Patientin -- in Kurzem eine Kuh gebären werde. -- Über dem kommt eine andere Patientin, die über dauernde Müdigkeit und Schwächezustände klagt. Ich führe sie -- eine Hysterikerin -- in ein anderes Zimmer und gebe ihr folgende Anweisung: "Wenn sie Sich wieder müde oder schlapp werden fühlen, nehmen Sie die Uhr und geben die Zahlen des Zifferblatts durch und sprechen sich dabei vor: 'Ich hab schon viel gearbeitet, ich hab schon viel gearbeitet.'" Die Arbeit, die mir dabei vorschwebt, ist eine Bewältigung der Zeit, indem sie gleichsam wie der Zeiger die Zahlen der Uhr durchläuft, was ihr das Gefühl der Befriedung geben soll. -- Beim Fortgehen zögert sie vor dem Spiegel, schaut hinein, und ich sehe schon im Spiegelbild die typische Veränderung des Gesichts -- leises Zucken um die Augen, wie wenn ein Schleier über das Gesicht hinab sinkt, die den Hysteriker charakterisieren. Sie will wieder in alte Geleise springen. Ich schaue sie nun sehr scharf an und spreche ihr den Spruch vor: "Ich hab schon viel gearbeitet, ich habe schon viel gearbeitet..." ununterbrochen, während ich sie zur Tür hinaus und den Flur entlang zum Wohnungseingang schiebe. Als sie an der Tür vorbeikommt, hinter der die Patientin liegt -- also Emme -- die rasche neugierige Frage: "Wer ist da drin?" Sie versucht alles, um hineinzuspähen. Doch gelingt es mir, sie vorbeizuschieben, und ich verabschiede sie mit dem Spruch, der wie ein Bann ihre Ohnmächte brechen soll. -- Inzwischen kommt eine junge blonde Ärztin, ich glaube mit einem Hund und kniehohen Stiefeln, eine Nervenärztin, die zu mir will, offenbar, um mit mir zusammen zu arbeiten. Da noch andere Ärzte in der Praxis sind, schaut sie mich erst kurz an, nennt mich dann aber richtig mit Namen (der im Traum ein anderer ist als in Wirklichkeit). Nach einem kurzen Blick in die Augen geht sie wieder. Ich wende mich nun wieder meiner Patientin zu. Sehe dabei, dass alle Zimmer voller Patienten sind, so dass ich sie nicht gleich finden kann. Auch in dem Raum, in dem sie auf einer Liege liegt und sich windet, sind noch andere Menschen, so ein Mann am Tisch sitzend, der wohl eine grosse Haube mit elektrischen Anschlüssen auf dem Kopf hat.

Ich schleudere ihm die Worte ins Gesicht: "Ich postuliere, ich postuliere..., dass die Sperre wegkommt". Er reagiert in so eleganter Weise darauf, dass ich in ein Gespräch verstrickt werde und der Familie in die Wohnung folge. An der Wand hängen Bilder von mir, zwei gelbe und eine weisse Zeichnung, darunter das Bild einer nackten liegenden Frau, die wie eine Tänzerin ihr rechtes Bein mit gestrecktem Fuss anzieht, und ein Porträt von Emme. Man weiss wohl nicht, dass die Zeichnungen von mir sind. Ich fühle mich sehr behaglich in der künstlerischen Atmosphäre des Hauses. Man legt die Beine auf den Tisch und plaudert miteinander. In mir wächst dabei eine starke Zuneigung zu der Tochter Nancy, einer Freundin von Emmes Schwester Gärdle. (153 words)

Die erste mit ziemlich groben Zähnen, die zweite mit feineren, und die dritte endlich ein Blatt mit ganz feinen Zähnen, das sich durch eine Stange so weit herausziehen lässt, dass ein langes, eher sensibles Instrument entsteht. Durch kleine Bolzen lassen sich die Gelenke blockieren, so dass die Stabilität grösser ist als bei gewöhnlichen Taschenmessern. (95 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1478 (1955-01-10 - Freiburg)Tintoretto war gestorben. Er sass in seinem Zimmer über einem Spiegel, in dem sich sein Gesicht abbildete und um ihn herum auf den Staffeleien und Tischen seine letzten Bilder, von diesen einige in den typischen Stil deutlich als "Tintoretto" zu erkennen. Andere aber -- noch unfertige Bilder, die die Namen der Mädchen tragen, die in ihnen porträtiert werden, ganz modern in einer Umwandlung des Stils, die an den frühen Picasso erinnert und doch in jedem Stück ganz Tintoretto. Eins der Mädchen kommt herein, sieht den toten Meister und malt dann -- etwas trostlos -- selbst an dem Bild weiter. Das Kleid des Mädchen auf dem Bild zeigt eine merkwürdige Musterung, kleine Figuren wie eine fortlaufende Punktierung, die Linien in der für Tintoretto typischen Schwingung ergibt und doch das Gewand als Ganzes sehr modern macht. Es entspinnt sich ein Gespräch über die Echtheit der Bilder, ein Gespräch, dessen Partner ich vergessen habe. Das Mädchen ist schliesslich so von Trauer befallen, dass sie hinausläuft, um sich in das grosse Hallentreppenhaus zu stürzen. Sie ist schon durch oder über das Geländer entwichen, doch gelingt es mir, sie noch vor dem Sturz an ihren tizianroten Haaren zu packen. Während sie so an meinen Händen über dem Abgrund schwebt, entsinne ich mich eines Gesprächs über einen kürzlich am Rande des Felsenbeckens geschehenen Unfall: Ein Mann konnte einen im Glatteis abrutschenden Jungen gerade noch packen, vermochte aber nicht, ihn hochzuziehen. Dieses kam mir unwahrscheinlich vor, und ich versuchte, das Gegenteil zu beweisen: es gelang mir, das Mädchen an den Haaren über das Geländer zu heben und auf die Arme zu nehmen. Aus einem Nachbarraum klang Tanzmusik, und ich schlug dem Mädchen, welches einverstanden war, vor, dort zu tanzen. Als ich jedoch mit ihr an den Raum kam, öffnete sich die Tür, und drinnen stand Professor Paal mit medizinischen Geräten und sagte: "Bitte, Herr v. Uslar, dort hinauf geht es zur Kinderberatung", eine Treppe hinauf weisend. Das Mädchen, das ich auf dem Arm getragen hatte, war jetzt ein kleines Kind und zwar ein kleiner rothaariger Junge. Zur gleichen Zeit kam aus einer anderen Tür Ursel Bülow (die ebenfalls rote Haare hat) und sagte: "Kommen Sie doch hier zu uns herein". Ich folgte ihr in dem Raum, in dem schon viele Mütter mit ihren Kindern versammelt waren, und ging später -- wie die anderen mit dem Jungen die Treppe hinauf. Der Junge war nicht mein Kind, sondern ein fremdes. (401 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1479 (1955-01-12 - Freiburg)Helmuth Plessner als der neue Herr von Roggow. Ich hatte ihm das Haus zu zeigen, das er übernehmen sollte, und das ich so genau kannte. Wir stiegen zuerst von der Diele kommend die alte Holztreppe hinauf. Oben wandte er sich von selbst dem Gang zu, der zu meinem ersten Zimmer führte und der neuerdings, wohl aus der Zeit der Flüchtlingsbewohnung, mit einer Tür abgeschlossen war. Wir gingen den Gang zu Ende bis dahin, wo rechter Hand eine Tür in mein Alkovenzimmer führte. Ich öffnete die Tür, wir traten in den halbdunklen Raum ein, der zunächst indifferent wirkte, dann aber, als ich das Licht anzündete und Möbel und Vorhänge in ihren freundlichen Farben aufleuchteten, Plessner sehr behagte, vor allem, als er das Bett im Alkoven entdeckte. In diesem Zimmer war die Möblierung unverändert, im Gegensatz zu allen anderen Zimmern des Hauses, die ich ihm nach und nach zeigte, von denen er jedoch in einer mich befriedigenden Art geistig Besitz nahm, in der ihm eigenen Mischung von warmem Interesse und doch abwesender Zurückhaltung, die er wohl mit dem Roggower gemein hatte. Bevor wir den grossen Saal betraten, war ich über eine Treppe erstaunt, die dort hinauffahre, wo eigentlich das Dach war. Vielleicht hatte man aufgestockt. - Den Saal fand ich verwirrend verändert, die massvolle italienische Stuckdecke, deren bunte Formen mich entzückt hatten, und der Kamin waren nicht mehr zu sehen. Durch den Raum waren Zwischenwände gezogen. Auch fehlten im ganzen Haus die bunten Wappenfenster, die der Roggower eingesetzt hatte. Ich erinnerte mich aber, dass sie in den Wirren der Nachkriegszeit von östlichen Einnehmern zerschlagen waren und dass die Wände im Saal zur Flüchtlings-Unterbringung gezogen waren. - Doch überwog die Freude, dass das Haus endlich wieder einen einzigen rechtmäßigen Herren bekommen sollte. wofür Plessner sehr geeignet schien. Während ich noch überlegte, ob ich ihn durch die rechte oder linke Stubenflucht führen sollte, um in den moderne Flügel des Hauses zu gelangen, öffneten wir eine Glastür, die ins Freue führte, und gerieten hinaus. - Mit einem Schlage war die Gegend verändert, ein Fluss , wie der Rhein, Hafen, wie Hamburg, Vorgelände einer Grossstadt. ich spürte, dass mit den Eintreten in diese Landschaft das Haus Roggow für mich verloren sein würde, in dem ich mich so geborgen gefühlt hatte. Es war so, dass ich zwar nicht im Traum um mein Träumen wusste, doch kannte ich die innere Logik dieses Zustandes und wusste, das ich die alte Szenerie zurück gewinnen musste, sollte der so befriedigende Gang durch das Haus weitergehen. Ich ging darum mit ungeheurer Anstrengung Schritt für Schritt zurück, wobei es immer dunkler wurde. Als es mir gelungen war, wieder in das Haus einzutreten, herrschte völlige Finsternis , und ich erwachte. (446 words)

Ich gehe an die angegebene Stelle in der Stadt -- es ist in Schwerin -, um auf diese Weise nach Hause (in das Elternhaus am See vor der Stadt) mitzufahren. Doch zu meinem Erstaunen finde ich weder ein Schiff noch Wasser dort. Zwei Mädchen, von denen die Anzeige zu stammen scheint, antworten mir auf meine Frage: Ja, sie hätten noch einen Platz, - heben die Platten von einem abgedeckten kleinen Kanal ab und ziehen ein Paddelboot hervor, auf das hin sie die Anzeige aufgegeben haben und in dem sie mich mitnehmen wollen. Ich frage, wo sie hinführen. Sie erklären mir einen umständlichen Weg, der zunächst in der der meinen entgegengesetzten Richtung durch die Stadt über kleine Gewässer in den See führt, den sie in der Gegend des Werderholzes erreichen müssen. Sie wollen dann, die grossen Buchten abschneidend, das Ufer entlang fahren, und ich sehe, dass sie dabei hinter meinem Elternhaus vorbeikämen. Ich erkläre ihnen, sie müssten mich an Adebors Nees, einer Landzunge am Franzosenweg, absetzen. So werden wir uns einig, und ich beginne, langsam aufzuwachen, während sie sich anschicken, für die Fahrt sich auszusziehen. Ich habe dabei das Bewusstsein, dass sie sich ganz bis auf einen Lendenschurz entkleiden, und entschliesse mich, mich selbst ganz nackt auszuziehen. (215 words)

Ich erinnere nur noch das Schema, dass es sich um eine Fahrt -- wohl in der Stadt -- handelte, deren Verlauf mir nach dem Erwachen Ähnlichkeit zu haben schien mit einem Traum aus dem Jahre 1949 (von der verfallenen Säulenkirche und der Madonna der sieben Monde -- siehe Traum Nr. 68).

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1492 (1955-01-29 - Freiburg)Kam zunächst mit Max Müller aus einem Haus (wie neulich nach dem Seminar aus dem "Schwarzwälder Hof"). Doch war auch die Atmosphäre von gestern Abend in dem Haus, wo ich bei Szilasi mit Binswanger, Max Müller, Fink, und anderen eingeladen war. Wir trafen ein paar Schritte nach dem Ausgang aus dem Haus auf das Klohäuschen am Schwabentor. (Entspricht der Lage des Schwarzwälder Hofes). Die Wartefrau verlangte von jedem 1 DM Gebühr, was mir sehr hoch vorkam. Dann Szenenwechsel: Ich sass neben der selben Frau in einer Art Vorortbahn, die über die Schweizer Grenze fahren sollte. Ich erkundigte mich nun bei dieser Frau, wo die Bahn hinführe -- es schien, dass sie auf Basel zulief -- und ob ich von dort Anschluss an das links liegende Kreuzlingen haben würde, das sich im Traum wie ein Vorort zu Basel verhielt und so gleichsam östlich von Basel lag (wie es in Wirklichkeit südlich von Konstanz liegt). Die Frau konnte nur wenig Auskunft über die Anschlüsse geben. Sie hatte durchschossene Kastanien (wohl Marroni) bei sich, die von Max Müller stammten. In jeder der braunen Kastanien steckte noch die Kugel. (185 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1493 (1955-01-31 - Freiburg)Ich entdeckte an unserem Zimmer seitlich Kammern, die ich ganz vergessen hatte und die sich sehr gut als Wirtschaftsräume eigneten. Sogar ein eigenes Klo war darin. Es waren schräge "Abseiten" unter dem Dach, doch sehr geräumig. (36 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1494 (1955-02-01 - Freiburg)Traum, der ein engmaschiges Gewebe war, in dem das Nacheinander eigentlich keine entscheidende Rolle mehr spielt, und in dem unter vielen anderen auch Antje und Emme vorkamen. Antje war nackt wie eine griechische Plastik, doch in einem dyonysischen Tumult, in dem auch ich zu ihr stürzte, ebenfalls ganz nackt. Wir feierten gleichsam eine Mariage à trois mit der untersetzteren Antje. In der nächsten Szene spielte es bei Emme, die in einem Zimmer sass -- irgendwie erwartend. Ich hatte hier schon nach dem Erwachen alle Einzelheiten vergessen. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1495 (1955-02-02 - Freiburg)Ich hatte die Holländerin Marijke, die ich aus Kreuzlingen kenne, als Patientin Benders psychologisch zu untersuchen. Danach ein Gespräch mit Bender anhand des Befragungsprotokolls (wie bei der Untersuchung der Patienten des Wunderdoktors Trampler). Ich sagte zu Bender: "Eigentlich müsste man noch hinzusetzen, dass sie eine Hysterica ist -- ich meine das natürlich nicht polemisch und keinesfalls als Schimpfwort, sondern ganz im positiven Sinne." Bender erwiderte: "Natürlich, ich weiss ja, dass Sie ein bisschen in sie verliebt sind." Dann schlossen sich erneute Untersuchungen an, in denen jedoch die Patientin jeweils nicht ganz identisch mit der wirklichen Marijke war -- zuweilen mehr ein blonder, zuweilen mehr ein schwarzer Typ. Und es war trotzdem die Identität da, es war im Grunde die Identität von Identität und Nicht-Identität (in dieser Richtung beschäftigte mich der Traum noch im und nach dem Erwachen.) (137 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1496 (1955-02-03 - Freiburg)Yoie kommt zu Hf. und erklärt ihm, dass sie ein Kind von ihm erwarte. Andere Szene: In der Eisenbahn. Ich treffe seit Jahren zum ersten Mal Margund wieder. Wir suchen zwei nebeneinander liegende Plätze. Mir scheint im Nachbarraum des Wagens mehr Platz zu sein, und ich reserviere uns zwei Plätze neben zwei Nonnen. Mit diesen beginnt sich gerade ein Gespräch über Yoie (die von Nonnen erzogen wurde) und die sie kennen, anzuspinnen, als ich erwache. (75 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1497 (1955-02-04 - Freiburg)Eine Psychologin in einem Kleid wie in Stoff gewickelt, das die Körperformen genau abzeichnet. Sie kehrte mir kokettierend -- wie im Menuett den Rücken zu. Es stieg eine Welle von Lust in mir hoch. (34 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1500 (1955-02-06 - Freiburg)In Hamburg in der Klosterallee, wo ich geboren bin und die ersten sechs Lebensjahre erlebte. Wir wohnten wieder in der alten Wohnung -- später dann in einer anderen der selben Strasse. Das Haus hatte die Nummer 22. Die Wohnung gefiel mir besser, denn sie war nur eine Treppe hoch oder Parterre, grosszügiger und nicht so staubig prunkvoll wie die andere. (60 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1501 (1955-02-07 - Freiburg)Gesellschaft -- eine Art Lager -- in Zelten. Nur einige von uns -- es waren die Einsiedler - zogen es vor, in dem Zimmer zu wohnen -- unter ihnen der etwas unsichere amerikanische Professor, der bei Szilasi ist. Kurz vor dem Aufbruch -- am Ende des Lagers -- kehrte ich in mein Zimmer zurück und fand, dass die dort Kampierenden manches unachtsam verstellt hatten. Die gelben Bilder an der Wand waren vom Wind losgerissen und nur flüchtig und ungenau wieder angeheftet. Im Nebenzimmer spielte Billchen auf der Couch -- auf ihre Art sich mit dem Rücken fortbewegend -- und hatte dabei sich den Kopf an der Wand gestossen. Ich sagte: "Passt denn niemand auf das Kind auf?" (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1502 (1955-02-08 - Freiburg)Psychologische Experimente in einer Gemeinschaftsuntersuchung (ähnlich der Untersuchung der Trampler-Patienten bei Bender). Ich habe zwei alte Leute, Herrn und Frau K., mit der Müller-Lührschen Täuschung zu untersuchen. Doch ist dieses Experiment jetzt so technisiert, dass man nur noch einen flimmernden Streifen sieht, der -- ähnlich wie manche Prüflichter in Radioapparaten - seine Länge schnell verändert. Die Versuchsperson muss an einem Drehknopf der veränderten Länge mit einer veränderten Einstellung von zwei markierenden Endpunkten folgen. Das Ganze geht so schnell, dass es zur automatischen Bewegung wird, etwa wie das Autofahren. So sitzen denn auch die Prüflinge in einem Prüfstand wie bei verkehrspsychologischen Prüfungen, einer kleinen Kabine, in der Herr und Frau K. nebeneinander Platz genommen haben. Herr K. verrichtet -- nach einer kurzen Anpassungszeit, seine Aufgabe sehr exakt, wie es seiner Art als Steuerberater entspricht. Frau K. dagegen ist unruhig und ablehnend. Sie dreht ein wenig an dem Knopf herum, gibt dann aber auf, wobei sie es fertig bringt, den Knopf so zu drehen, wie wenn man ein Radio abstellt, wobei das ganze Gerät sich in Explosionen entlädt. Das Licht verlöscht, statt dessen steigt Gas und Dampf nach oben. Ich stürze hinaus, um technisch versierte Hilfe zu finden. Doch ist niemand aufzutreiben. Ich höre nur, dass es h. sei -- also Wasserstoff -- was aus meinem Gerät aufsteige. Mit diesem werde also die Lichtquelle betrieben. Schliesslich finde ich Herrn Rüter -- unseren alten Tischler -- und will ihn um Hilfe bitten. Es ist in Wittmoldt. Szenenwechsel: Ein mir bisher noch unbekanntes Treppenhaus. Es ist sehr ordentlich. Es ist eine etwas empire- oder biedermeierhafte Einrichtung. Sofas stehen an den Wänden mit weissem Holz und Gobelins, ähnlich wie bei Szilasis Stilmöbeln. Das Ganze ist stilecht und adrett. Ich steige das Treppenhaus hinauf. Was sich oben abspielte, habe ich vergessen. Ich habe dort wohl in einer schrankartigen Kammer übernachtet, die aber noch nach hinten eine Tür hatte, durch die es auf einen Dachboden ging. Dort nächtigte -- wohl im Stroh -- ein junges Ehepaar. Die junge Frau -- ich glaube mit aufgelösten Haaren und im Schlafanzug -- musste durch meinen Schrank hindurch. Ich stand kurz vor der Abreise -- am nächsten Morgen in der Frühe wollte ich aufbrechen und verabschiedete mich deshalb schon am Abend. (370 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1503 (1955-02-10 - Freiburg)Ritt auf einem Esel durch die Berg- und Talstrasse, in der unser Elternhaus stand. Auf einem steilen Berg stieg ich ab, um den Esel zu schonen, in dem ich hinten über den Schwanz herabrutschte. Ich hatte wenig an. Sommer.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1504 (1955-02-11 - Freiburg)Ich führe ein Fahrrad bergab die Strasse hinunter, dabei von Zeit zu Zeit, wie auf einem Roller, mit dem Fuss auf einem Pedal stehend, denn aufsitzen kann ich nicht, weil die Bremse nicht funktioniert. Bei dem Rollern bekommt das Rad eine solche Geschwindigkeit, dass ich es nicht mehr halten kann. Ich springe ab und lasse es sausen -- die Strasse entlang -- quer über eine Kreuzung - rollt das unbemannte Rad. Ich fürchte Zusammenstösse und Komplikationen; das Rad nähert sich einem Zaun, an dem es zerschellen muss -- doch nein, es trifft gerade eine offenstehende Pforte. Der Zaun umschliesst einen Park. Links ein Weg, dem das Rad folgt, rechts ein steiler Rasenabhang, auf dem Kinder spielen, unten ein Haus. Das Rad kommt vom Weg ab und saust den Hang hinunter. Ich fürchte, es könne die spielenden Kinder überfahren, und laufe, so schnell ich kann, hinterher. Da verwandelt sich das Rad in einen kleinen Löwen oder einen Hund (irischen Setter). Ich rufe den Kindern zu: "Das ist in Wirklichkeit ein Rad, das ist in Wirklichkeit ein Rad." Das Tier -- immer noch in der gleichen mechanischen Bewegungsform wie das Rad - nähert sich dem Haus, ohne das etwas passiert ist. Ich denke, nun muss es hier zerschellen, doch eine Kellerpforte lässt es ein und drinnen kommt es endlich zur Ruhe. Umgeben von den Kindern, immer noch erklärend, dass das Tier doch eigentlich ein Rad sei, erreiche ich den Kellereingang und locke rufend das Tier heraus. Es kehrt langsam aus dem Keller zu mir als seinem Herrn zurück, meine Hand halb leckend, halb mit den Zähnen spielend in sein Maul nehmend. Dann machen wir uns zusammen auf den Rückweg auf die Strasse. (280 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1505 (1955-02-11 - Freiburg)Mit Max Müller im Garten eines einsamen Waldrestauerants. Als er ein langweiliges Seminarmitglied hereinkommen sieht, verlässt er auf Schleichwegen mit mir den Garten. -- Ein dritter Traum handelte von einer Tagung ähnlich der in Ragaz. Er ging wohl unmittelbar aus dem Müller-Traum hervor. Wir hörten einige Redner durch Lautsprecher aus einem Schaufenster, als wir durch den Raum gingen. (58 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1506 (1955-02-13 - Freiburg)Wir wohnten auf dem Dach eines Hauses. Während Emme Billchen wickelte (ich träumte den Traum, als ich morgens noch einmal einschlief, während Emme Billchen wickelte), stieg ich eine kleine Leiter hinab auf einen tieferen Dachvorsprung, um mich dann über die Simse und Mauervorsprünge immer weiter in die Tiefe zu versteigen. Als ich schon fast unten war, fiel mir ein, wie Emme sich erschrecken würde, wenn sie mich oben nicht mehr sehen würde, und ich beschloss, so schnell wie möglich wieder hinaufzusteigen. Doch wurde ich jetzt an den Simsen unsicher und fürchtete herabzustürzen. Da dachte ich mir, wenn ich die Möglichkeit hätte, Gott darum zu bitten, dass er mich in irgend ein Tier verwandele, so würde ich ihn bitten, mich zu einem Vogel zu machen, wenn ich abstürzte. Doch in dem Gedanken, dass ich dann für immer ein Vogel bleiben müsste, überlegte ich mir, Gott zu bitten, dass er mich danach zu einem mächtigen Tiger machen solle. Doch auch das wollte ich nicht immer bleiben -, so würde ich von Tier zu Tier wechseln müssen, denn Mensch könnte ich nie wieder werden. Bei diesen Überlegungen war ich die schwankende Leiter hinaufgelangt, und als ich oben ankam, wo Emme Billchen wickelte, erwachte ich (und sah, dass Emme Billchen wickelte). (207 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1507 (1955-02-14 - Freiburg)Wir fahren in einer jener altmodischen Strassenbahnen, die nach vorne und hinten offen sind. Max Müller als Fahrer. Düsenjäger überfliegen die Stadt. Der Lärm wird immer stärker. Schliesslich braust eine Maschine so dicht über uns hinweg, dass wir auch den Lufthauch spüren. Dann taucht die grosse Silhouette in unserem Blickfeld auf, schiesst auf den Berg zu, an dem sie zerschellen müsste, reisst sich noch im letzten Augenblick empor, dreht einige gewaltige Saltos, die immer grösser werden, und schlägt schliesslich in der Stadt zerstiebend auf. Furchtbare Detonationen. Wir werfen uns am Boden unseres Fahrzeugs nieder. Da ich ganz aussen am Rande des offenen Führerstandes liege, krieche ich noch über die Anderen weg, die mich zur Vorsicht mahnen. Doch weiss ich, dass wir bis zum Eintreffen der Splitter noch einige Sekunden Zeit haben, und suche mir eine geschütztere Stelle am Eingang des Inneren des Wagens. (143 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1508 (1955-02-14 - Freiburg)Auf der Wanderung nach Hagenow und weiter noch nach Ludwigslust, seitwärts die Berge. (Das entspricht nicht der wirklichen Geographie, denn Hagenow und Ludwigslust liegen in der Nähe meiner Heimatstadt Schwerin im Flachland und auch nicht in der selben Richtung). Der Weg wurde mir zu weit. Ich sah an einem Bahnhof Züge fahren, grosse Fernzüge und kleinere Züge und Triebwagen, die von Frauen geleitet waren. Sie standen sehr lässig und natürlich im Führerstand. Auch einen Milchwagen sah ich mit Pferden auf der Strasse. Ich überlegte, womit ich fahren sollte, und entschloss mich für den Fernzug. Am Bahnsteig war eine Barometeranlage, die ich betrachtete. Doch konnte ich das Spielen der Zeiger auf unbekannten Skalen nicht verstehen. Das Wetter war aber für die Reise wichtig. Es war strahlende Sonne und blauer Himmel. Hochdruckwetter -- und so deutete ich auch das unverständliche Barometer. (139 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1509 (1955-02-15 - Freiburg)Wir hatten drei Töchter. Die jüngste im Alter von Ilsebill (sechs Monate) -- aber sie konnte schon reden. Die Mittlere ein Jahr und die Älteste zwei Jahre älter. Die Älteste der Drei, die eigentlich alle Billchen ähnlich waren und von denen jede irgendwo mit ihr identisch war, wurde, glaube ich, Susi genannt. Der Traum war sehr heiter und gehörte zu denen, deren Stimmung einem noch lange erhalten bleibt. - Anderer Traum: Georges Bidault, der ehemalige französische Aussenminister, hatte in der Zeitung über seine Reiseerlebnisse berichtet, - dass er eigentlich überall gerne gewesen sei -- nur in Freiburg nicht -- da sei es so furchtbar heiss, und er wäre darum, statt dort zu bleiben, nach Frankreich zurückgefahren. Emme las mir dies aus einer Zeitung vor. Danach wachte ich auf und träumte nach erneutem Einschlafen, ich habe Bidault auf seinen Reisen begleitet. Auch Mendes France spielte eine Rolle. (146 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1510 (1955-02-16 - Freiburg)Wir hatten eine wunderschöne Wohnung -- im Dachgeschoss eines Schlosses. Ein grossräumiges Zimmer. Vom Klo aus schaute man hinaus durch eine Dachluke auf den Park. Ein Ausstieg -- gleich einer Feuerleiter -- führte durch diese Luke übers Dach auf eine Terrasse. Während ich noch dort war und gerade meine Hose ordnete, kam ein Mann mit einem jungen Mädchen -- es waren Bekannte -- den Ausstieg hineingeklettert. Ich hielt sie, so lange es nötig war, zurück. Dann gingen wir in die Wohnung. Das Mädchen entdeckte, dass vom Klo direkt eine Tür in ein noch anderes Zimmer führte. Es war quadratischer als das andere in den Grundmassen und in einem Winkel gebaut und wirkte ganz entzückend. Dieses wurde noch von einem Mädchen bewohnt. Doch sollten wir es später kriegen. Auch Emmi schien darauf zu reflektieren. Ich war ganz glücklich über die Wohnung. Andere Szenen gingen, glaube ich, dieser vorher -- oder folgten ihr? Es war filmartig -- doch erlebte ich selbst die Handlung. Ich war in einen Palast eingedrungen, es war um Ostern. Ich war im Saal der Königin und Despotin, die noch ein junges Mädchen war. Diese zückte ein dolchartiges Messer, mit dem sie spielte, mit breiter blitzender Klinge. Doch ich hatte auch ein solches Messer, das ich aus der Scheide zog, und wir wetzten die Klingen aneinander. Es war ein ungeheuer wollüstiges Geräusch und Gefühl. In diesem Moment kam ein Hofbeamter herein und vermutete Mordabsichten. Doch machte ich der Königin klar, dass das Spiel mit dem Messer nur eine erotische Symbolik sei, und dass ich nichts anderes damit bezweckt hätte. Sie verstand mich und sagte: "Ich gebe Ihnen die Chance zur Flucht", als der Beamte einen Augenblick heraus war, "doch eilen Sie sich". Ich ergriff, während sie hinausging, die ledernde Scheide, steckte das Messer hinein und machte mich aus dem Staube. Ich lief die Treppe hinunter auf die Strasse. Dort war mir das Messer, das inzwischen eine Pistole geworden war, abhanden gekommen. Ich sah eine Pistole auf der Strasse liegen und griff sie als die meine. Doch stellte sich später heraus, dass es eine Kinderpistole war. Danach hiess auch der Film: "Die Kinderpistole". Ich stieg in eine U-Bahn und fuhr durch die Stadt. Es musste Berlin sein, ich sah dies mit Emme zusammen wie im Film. Denn die Bahn fuhr unter einer Brücke hindurch, auf der etwas von Havel-Quell oder Grunewald-Quellen oder ähnlich stand. Dahinter eine Anlegestelle für kleine Dampfer mit dem Schild "Wedding". In der Ferne Blick auf grosse Seen. Ich war wohl noch immer verfolgt und zog mich darum in die neue Wohnung zurück, die ich zum ersten Mal betrat. Dann folgte wohl die zuerst beschriebene Szene. (439 words)

Sie scheint es nicht zu merken. Die Flammen laufen auch auf den Rücken. Ich drücke sie aus. Auf dem Kopf ist ein kreisrundes Loch in die Haare gebrannt.

Doch statt des Aufzugs hebt sich das ganze Stockwerk mit allen Leuten, die das gewohnt sind. Auf einmal ist Emme verschwunden. Ich suche sie überall im Haus, ohne sie zu finden. Schliesslich sagt mir einer der Leute, dass ganz oben im höchsten Stockwerk ein Nonnenkloster sei, von dem schon früher einmal eine Frau geraubt worden sei, die man Jahre später dort oben gefunden hatte. Ich begebe mich sofort hinauf und finde im Erwachen dort Emme, der gerade eine Nonne die Haare scheren will. (103 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1513 (1955-02-22 - Freiburg)Fest in barocken Räumen (altes Haus mit dicken Mauern). Tanzende Mädchen in schwingenden Röcken. Später oder in einem anderen Raum waren die Mädchen und die Männer nackt und Lichter spielten auf den liegenden und feiernden Körpern, wie auf den Bildern Tintorettos. Dies waren gleichzeitig die Bilder einer Illustrierten. Anderer Traum, oder andere Szene: Haus mit vielen Räumen und vielen Treppen, wie Benders Institut oder die Kunstakademie, (der "Fuchsbau"). Im oberen Raum, der "die Bibliothek" genannt wurde, sassen die Ärzte Marx und Enke und untersuchten die Patienten (wie bei der Trampler-Untersuchung). Ich hatte ihnen über Umfallen und ähnliche Beschwerden zu klagen. Marx sagte mir: "Ich sag Ihnen ganz offen, das kommt, weil sie die Knie nicht richtig durchdrücken. -- Mir ist es selbst einmal so gegangen, dass ist rein psychogen." Auch Enke stimmte dem bei. In einer anderen Szene traf ich meinen Vater in Schwerin auf der Strasse -- mit Strohhut und Röhrchenhosen. Ich war sehr berührt von dieser an vieles erinnernden Begegnung. (162 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1515 (1955-02-28 - Freiburg)Ein Brief des Schahs von Persien, in dem er mir mitteilt, dass ich auf seine Kosten im Dezember nach Wittmoldt gehen könne. Für den Rest der Zeit könne ich dann mit seinem Geld in ein Kinderheim gehen. Ausserdem war noch ein Brief von einer anderen orientalischen Kaiserin da, mit ähnlichen Hilfsangeboten. Wir fanden beide -- Emme und ich -- dass wir die Hilfe ja jetzt im kommenden Sommer viel besser brauchen könnten, und zwar lieber kürzer, aber für uns beide. So beschloss ich, an den Schah, der seinen Brief mit "Fritz" unterschrieben hatte, und an die Kaiserin zu schreiben. Doch machte mir die Anrede als Majestät Schwierigkeiten und kam mir auch komisch vor. Erwachen mit diesem Gedanken. Die Schrift des Schahs blieb mir nach dem Erwachen noch genau in Erinnerung: es war ein feiner Strich mit schlanken Ober- und Unterlängen und einer Winkelbindung. (143 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1516 (1955-03-02 - Freiburg)Bei Gisela und Peter in Petersburg, wo sie ihre Wohnung hatten. Dort stand auf dem Fussboden, fast die freie Fläche eines Zimmers einnehmend, ein gläsernes Spielklavier, Flügel, so gross, dass gerade ein Vierjähriger hineinkriechen könnte, und ganz dicht über dem Fussboden. Die Grundplatte war aus feinem Holz, das übrige Gehäuse aus Glas, so dass man die goldenen Saiten sehen konnte. Wir sprachen miteinander, wie man verhüten könne, dass alle Kinder da hineinkriechen würden, und kamen zu dem Schluss, dass der Bub gewiss doch hereinkriechen würde. Gisela hatte ein Gewand an, dass wie bei einer Tänzerin sich nur locker über den Brüsten schloss, so dass man hätte hereingreifen können. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1517 (1955-03-02 - Freiburg)Hermhaus hatte einen Ehering ähnlich wie die unseren mit einer umlaufenden Schrift. Doch konnte man bei ihm die kleinen Goldbuchstaben zusammenhängend abnehmen, und es blieb nur der Reif zurück. Er gab mir den Ring zum Putzen. Als ich den italienischen Spruch abgenommen hatte, blieb zunächst ein dünner Goldreif mit kleinen Löchern, doch dann entdeckte auch auf diesem noch eine Schrift. Zuerst dachte ich, der alte Spruch sei noch zum Teil darauf geblieben, doch dann entdeckte ich statt der Quadratschrift schlankere Buchstaben und einen deutschen Text, der sogar mit Bildern ausgeschmückt war, so sah ich Kurtisanen in Netzgewändern -- es waren Gestalten aus dem Mittelalter und aus der Antike.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1518 (1955-03-05 - Freiburg)Zunächst Nachts: Vom Krieg. Wir mussten einen Angriff laufen. - Später gegen Morgen Traum von einer Ausstellung oder Museum, das wohl dem Kunstgewerbe dienen sollte, aber nicht fortgeführt war. Auf jeden Fall standen überall Dinge, vor allem Lampen, die man auch in jedem Kunstgeschäft hätte kaufen können - , und man erwog, diese Sammlung aufzulösen, die einzelnen Stücke zu verkaufen, wozu auch ich riet. Ausserdem standen Bücher in Regalen an den Wänden -- offenbar eine Bibliothek, die in Gebrauch gewesen war, denn überall lagen in den Bänden Kunstpostkarten, wie auch ich sie immer als Lesezeichen benutze. Es waren hier alles Miniaturen, wie ich sie noch nie gesehen hatte, häufig in leuchtendem Blau wie die alten gotischen, doch zugleich von der kräftigen Vitalität, die den orientalischen eigen ist. Ganz besonders fesselte mich eine Karte: Auf tief leuchtend blauen Grund ein Mann mit nacktem Oberkörper, der den Bogen spannte nach irgend einem Tier, ich glaube einem Vogel. Die Hautfarbe und die gespannten Muskeln des nackten Oberkörpers waren in vollendeter Weise getroffen und sammelten sich gleichsam auf dem tiefen eindringlichen Blau des Grundes. Ich hätte die Karte am liebsten sofort an mich genommen, was man auch sicher erlaubt hätte. Doch fand ich selbst, und Emme und die anderen bestätigten es, dass es richtiger wäre, erst danach zu fragen. Im zweiten Raum hatten wir es uns zwischen den Büchern heimisch gemacht -- etwa wie man im Kriege irgendwo in fremden Häusern für eine Nacht kampiert. Ich hatte gerade mein Raucherzeug auf einem Hocker aufgebaut und lag auf einem Bett, als einer der anderen -- es waren Kollegen oder Kriegskumpanen -, ein Buch aus dem Regal zog, dass er offenbar mit mir lesen wollte: Es waren -- in altem schweinsledernen Band - eine Abhandlung Luthers über die mittelalterliche Theologie -- ein Band aus der Weimarer Ausgabe. Ich überlegte noch, dass Luther ja selbst im Grunde noch ein Theologe des Mittelalters gewesen sei und darum besonders befähigt, darüber zu schreiben. Wir schlugen das Buch auf, und hier wandelte sich die Szene: Der Inhalt des Buches war ein neues Erlebnis: Ein Mädchen sass auf einer Couch, wo Nadel und Faden lagen, die noch mit dem Stoff der Decke verbunden waren. Sie sagte: "Die kann ich ja wohl einfach abschneiden". Aber während sie den Faden durchschnitt, wobei mir ihr Körper ganz nahe kam, hörten wir das Schreien einer Katze, das damit in einem magischen Zusammenhang stand. Ich hatte Bleistift und Papier in der Hand, um das vor mir gebeugte Mädchen, das mit der Schere den Faden durchschnitt, zu zeichnen, und ich spürte, dass mir dies mit wenigen runden Strichen gelingen würde, doch wollte ich die Katze mit auf dem Bild haben, und wir suchten sie überall, weil sei ja bei dem Bett sein musste, wo sie immer noch quäkte -- doch während des Suchens noch erwachte ich und hörte das Schreien meiner Tochter Ilsabe, die Hunger hatte. Es war identisch mit dem Quäken der Katze. (487 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1519 (1955-03-07 - Freiburg)Besuch bei meinem Bruder. Nachts. Ohne den Raum ganz zu erfassen, erkenne ich nur ein merkwürdig aufgestocktes Bett, in dessen oberer Plattform ich schlafe. Am Morgen entlarvt sich das Zimmer: eine düstere blaue Tapete mit schwarzen Blümchen. Dem Bett hat mein Bruder selbst die originelle Form gegeben: Es ist ein altes voluninöses Holzbett, das er auseinander nahm. Überall stehen noch die Seitenteile an den Wänden herum; offenbar darf er sie nicht herausstellen. Die Matrazen hat er zu einer Couch aufgestapelt, hat dabei aber die kurzen Stücke längs oben draufgelegt und mit einem der Holzteile umrahmt, so dass so etwas wie ein Bett im Bett, ein kleiner höherer Stock entsteht. Dieses Bettgebäude war zunächst alles, was ich zunächst nachts erfasst hatte. Ich wusste nicht, ob überhaupt ein Zimmer darum war oder nicht. Beim Aufstehen Morgens erfasste ich nun, dass er das übrige Zimmer kaum bewohnte. Da standen zwei alte Waschtische, die ich zunächst für Harmoniums hielt. Hohe Aufbauten mit unendlich vielen Schubladen in der Mitte, ein Spiegel, davor ein Wasserglas. Ein Stück stand vor dem Möbel, das sehr altmodisch war, aber nicht ohne Reiz. Doch alle Schubladen und Fächer in diesem und anderen waren leer. Er hatte seine Toilettensachen alle auf Borten aufgestellt, um sie sehen zu können. Ich überlegte, wie man die Tapete übermalen und die Stube einrichten könnte, so dass sie wohnlich würde. Doch der Wirt schien sehr unfreundlich zu sein. Später geriet ich in einen Nachbarraum, der unsere alte geräumige Göttinger Stube bei Stresaus war. Ihr jetztiger Bewohner kam aus Stresaus Zimmer herein. Dann Szenenwechsel: Ich war bei einem Schüler Nicolai Hartmanns, vielleicht derselbe Mann, vielleicht Professor Wein. Er hatte einen kleinen elektrischen Patentofen,und ein kleines Mädchen. Hartmann lebte noch und kam als ganz alter Mann aus der Tür zum Nebenraum herein. Ich schüttelte ihm und dem Kind die Hand. Er war bei allem Alter doch in seinem Wesen unverändert, energisch und befehlend. Andere Szene: Auf der Strasse, nach meinem Besuch bei meinem Bruder. Ich zog mich immer ungeniert in der Buchhandlung Albert (eigentlich in Freiburg) um, und deponierte dort meine Kleider -- weil ich keinen anderen Raum hatte. Zuletzt wurde es aber doch peinlich. Andere Szene: Ich traf in einem Haus die Ueberlebenden eines Vekehrsunfalls. Der Wagen war in eine Hausecke hineingefahren. Der eine Mann war nicht zu retten. Das Haus lastete auf ihm. Der eine Lungenflügel arbeitete nicht mehr. Eine Operation war nicht möglich, weil der Mann eingeklemmt war. Seine Frau sollte jetzt nach Amerika. Ein Autofahrer, mit dem ich fuhr, sollte sie nach Bremen mitnehmen. Der andere Mann hatte sich aus dem Plexiglas des Wagens und anderen Teilen ein Amulett machen lassen, das seine Frau immer tragen sollte. Er wollte daran das Glück und Gelingen seiner Ehe knüpfen. Ich fand das nicht richtig. Einfälle: - (460 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1520 (1955-03-13 - Freiburg)Im Gespräch mit einer von Gregors Schwestern kam mir diese so nahe, dass sich unsere Leiber fast berührten, und es war, als wenn ein Strom von ihr auf mich überginge und mich mit grosser Gewalt an sie zöge. Sie trat zum Fenster, um den Vorhang zu schliessen. Doch war in diesem Augenblick schon der Moment zur Umarmung verstrichen. Ich schrieb dann dies Erlebnis auf -- etwa wie einen Traum -- und als es Gregor später zufällig las, fand ich es stilistisch sehr gelungen -- nur an einer Stelle war eine unglückliche Häufung des Wortes "beglückend". Andere Szene. Spielte in einer Räumlichkeit wie Benders Institut. Frau Böhringer war in der Nähe. Ich war wieder mit dem Mädchen zusammengetroffen -- doch wusste ich nicht mehr, welche Schwester Gregors es ursprünglich gewesen war. Das heisst, es war zunächst eigentlich eine Einheit aus beiden. Die andere war aber gestorben. Wir traten nach unserem verbotenen Zusammentreffen in das Zimmer, in dem sie schon seit längerem aufgebahrt lag. Die Lebende zog das Tuch von ihrer toten Schwester, ein unendlich weisses und klein gewordenes Gesicht kam zum Vorschein. Doch dann geschah etwas Furchtbares. Sie schlug die Augen auf, neigte den Kopf zur Seite, das Gesicht wurde langsam grösser und schaute mich fragend und anklagend an, denn sie war es, die ich ursprünglich von den beiden Schwestern geliebt hatte. Während dessen aber schrumpfte die andere -- noch stehende -- Schwester im Gesicht entsetzlich zusammen. Sie wurde kreideweiss und nahm den Ausdruck der Toten an. Ich wachte mit Entsetzen und furchtbarem Herzklopfen auf In einem Moment, als die Tote noch nicht wieder ganz lebendig und die Lebendige noch nicht ganz tot war. Beides hielt sich noch in grauenhafter Weise die Waage. (282 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1521 (1955-03-14 - Freiburg)Ich höre ein Konzert barocker Musik und schaue dabei hinter dem Balken (wie in meinem Bett unter der schrägen Wand und hinter dem Balken liegend) hervor auf das Orchester. Nach Beendigung des Konzertes sagt der Dirigent: "Wir haben jetzt noch eine Stunde Zeit und spielen die Vierte Symphonie von Robert Schumann." -- Die Orchestermusiker klappen die Noten zusammen und spielen aus dem Gedächtnis. Es ist eine grossartige Improvisation. Der Dirigent hebt den Taktstock, gleichsam in der Bewegung die Musik vormalend, woran man bedeutende Dirigenten erkennt, dabei nur in winzigen Nuancen der Bewegung, und die Musik zieht die Bewegung in einer überraschenden Weise nach. Ich sitze direkt hinter dem Dirigenten, der gleichzeitig das Cello spielt, an einer Brüstung, und schaue versonnen ins Orchester, wobei der Anblick der Bewegung der Instrumente und die gehörten Töne in eine Einheit verwachsen. Plötzlich, nachdem sein Cellopart beendet ist, erhebt sich der Dirigent, das Orchester einen Moment allein lassend, dreht sich zu dem sehr esoterischen Publikum und sagt, eine Obstschale nach hinten reichend: "Ich habe eben gehört, wie eine Kartoffel zu Boden gefallen ist -- hier dies zum Ersatz" darin sowohl seine Fürsorge für die Zuhörer als auch seine Souveränität beweisend. Die Orchesterspieler sind in dieser Pause ohne Leitung ein wenig aus der Façon gekommen und schwimmen. Sowie der Dirigent den Taktstock in die Hand nimmt, wird die Führung wieder straff. (225 words)

Aber es war schon besetzt, wie mir die Wirtschafterin sagte, der ich erzählte, dass ich noch Frau Speiser, ihre Vorgängerin, gekannt habe. Andere Szene: Wir wohnten nun doch in dem Zimmer, doch war es nicht ganz zu ebener Erde, sondern hölzerne Stufen führten hinauf, und auch nicht ganz verglast, sondern teilweise offen wie ein Balkon. Ich hatte Wasser auf einer Platte zum Kochen aufgestellt. Als wir hinaufbklickten, sahen wir, dass eine Gans aus dem Garten hinaufgekommen war, um aus dem fast schon kochenden und dampfenden Wasser zu trinken. Sie verbrannte sich den Schnabel und attackierte uns nun. Ich riet Emme, ein Scheit Holz zu ergreifen und die Gans hineinbeissen zu lassen, und tat dasselbe. Emme aber ergriff die Flucht und verbarg sich im Garten (dem Rosengarten). So musste ich sie allein abwehren und verscheuchen, was mir nach langem Bemühen gelang. (157 words)

Ein Irrer wollte mit einem Knüppel oder Kasten auf mich losgehen. Ich sah, dass er noch ein Beil -- zur Arbeit -- am Fenster liegen hatte, und versuchte, es sicherzustellen. Vorhergegangen war ein Gespräch mit dem Professor und leichten Irren über die Komik. Jetzt nach dem Überfall waren die Anderen tief betroffen entsetzt, ob das auch ihre Möglichkeit sei. Sie fragten und bestürmten mich: "Können auch wir so werden?". (88 words)

Ich konnte aber Emme überzeugen, dass es auf dem unteren zöge, indem ich sie den Fuss auf die Bodenspalten setzen liess. Die Entdeckung des doppelten Bodens als solche erfreute mich. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1529 (1955-04-01 - Freiburg)Durch eine merkwürdige Spiegelung sieht man plötzlich für eine kurze Zeit auch bei Nacht. Ich merke es zuerst, wie ein Lichtschein auf mein Gesicht fällt. Dann entdecken wir in der Sonne selbst eine Spiegelung von der Erde her: Man sieht ein hohes Schneegebirge wie die Alpen -- im Vordergrund einen Kurort, ganz deutlich Haus für Haus. Zwei Hirsche aus Bronze. Ich denke zuerst, er könne der Hirschsprung im Höllental sein. Dann entdecke ich, dass die Plastiken auf dem Dach eines Hauses in dem Kurort stehen. Man erkennt nun auch einzelne Kinoreklamen. Sie sind in deutscher Sprache verfasst. Offenbar ist es ein Ort aus der Schweiz, dessen Spiegelung wir in der nächtlichen Sonne sehen. Ich versuche, das Bild näher einzustellen -- was man an den Knöpfen eines Radios kann, doch stört der Sohn des Hauses, den offenbar die Berge mehr interessieren, der mehr geographisches als kulturkundliches Interesse hat. Es ist im Hause Bauch. Nachdem das Phänomen vorüber ist, beschliessen wir, mit dem Auto fortzufahren. Vater und Sohn beraten darüber, welchen Wagen sie nehmen sollen. Sie scheinen drei zur Verfügung zu haben. Schliesslich steigen wir in einen grossen alten Wagen. Der Sohn Hans Bauch setzt sich vorne auf den Beifahrersitz. Mir wird die Tür zur hinteren Bank geöffnet. Doch der Vater, anstatt sich ans Steuerrad zu setzen, klettert auf das Dach des Wagens, wobei dieser sich auch schon in Bewegung setzt. Der Sohn macht keine Miene, das Steuer zu ergreifen, und so angle ich mich schliesslich von hinten herüber und fasse -- obwohl des Fahrens unkundig -- das Steuer. Übrigens ist auch an meinem Hintersitz ein Steuer angebracht, wie ich beim Einsteigen bemerke. Seine Funktion ist mir jedoch nicht klar. Es gelingt mir nur mühsam, zwischen Fussgängern hindurchzusteuern, und ich höre den Vater Bauch vom Dach des Wagens herunterrufen: "Sitzt denn da ein Betrunkener am Steuer!" (304 words)

Dieser Einwand scheint berechtigt, denn der Garten ist aus irgendwelchen historischen Gründen und Besitzverhältnissen teilweise gepflastert, teilweise mit Holzboden belegt -- auf jeden Fall nicht wie ein richtiger Garten. Ich bin selbst darüber erstaunt. Emme erklärt mir jedoch, dass früher das Nachbarhaus mit dazu gehört habe -- als Stallgebäude: Der Garten war also eigentlich ein Hof. Teile gehörten ursprünglich anderswo hin. Darum die ungleiche Bodenbedeckung. Zuerst waren es Feuerwehrleute, die -- bei einer Übung -- durch den Garten gelaufen waren.

Ich finde mich nicht so gut zurecht und komme nicht recht zum Arbeiten. Ein grosses Schwimmbad ist mitten im Haus. Viele Kinder liegen im Wasser. Elegant gekleidete Frauen gehen in den Wandelgängen. Es ist zugleich wie ein Theater am Tage im Sommer. Auch eine sehr braungebrannte Frau im Bikini. Sie scheint sich mit unter die Patienten mischen zu wollen. Dann ein Gespräch mit Reinert und Bender. Bender sagt zu Reinert und mir: "Warum hasst Ihr Euch nur so?" Wir sind erstaunt über dies Fragestellung, denn wir verstehen uns eigentlich recht gut. Bender erzählt: "Ich muss mich ja um die Beziehung meiner Leute untereinander kümmern und dafür interessieren, sonst kann es passieren, dass die Arbeit zum Stillstand kommt." Offenbar denkt er daran, dass unklare Beziehungen das Arbeitsklima zerstören können. -- Dann bin ich in den Kellern des Gebäudes. Irgendwo finde ich unter arbeitenden Frauen Emme als Schwester -- aber in der Zeit, wo ich sie noch nicht kannte, also gleichsam in der Vergangenheit. Sie kommt aber trotzdem erfreut auf mich zu und begrüsst mich. Andere Szene: Dann -- in denselben Kellern -- es ist Krieg. Feindliche Truppen stehen mit Maschinenpistolen vor den Fenstern und wollen eindringen. Wir haben uns in dem Weinkeller versteckt und wollen uns ergeben. Doch wenn wir vorkommen, um die Hände hochzuheben, schiessen die Maschinenpistolen. Ein Mädchen ist unter den Soldaten, mit nackten Armen und Beinen im Badeanzug und mit Maschinenpistole. Sie kommt durchs Fenster hinein, gleichsam als meine Besiegerin. Ich lege sie auf einen Tisch, um ihr den Badeanzug vom Leibe zu reissen. Ihre Gegnerschaft ist in Leidenschaft umgeschlagen.

Doch er zögerte und zog eine Liste hervor, auf der er angebliche Ausgaben für uns aufgezeichnet hatte, die aber augenscheinlich ganz fadenscheinig waren, und die zusammen den Wert von einem Zentner Kohlen, das war gleich hundert Mark, ergeben sollten. Er begann die Liste mit dem Posten: "Eine silberne Gabel von dem an den Ort transportiert".

Vorhergehende Szene: Ich fahre mit einem Motorfahrrad, das aber auch Fusshebel wie ein Auto hat, den Radweg entlang der Chaussée (die der Tugendpfad abkürzt) und bin dabei in Gefahr, mit den schmalen Rädern in die Fahrradsteine (wie sie zum Abstellen der Räder vor der Universitätsbibliothek stehen) zu geraten. Als ich etwa beim Greenhouse angelangt bin, sehe ich am Horizont, - es ist Abend oder Nacht -- eine haushohe Stichflamme aufsteigen. Die Leute sagen: "Es brennt in der Regenfabrik in der Lübecker Strasse". Ich muss nun in die Lübecker-Strasse. Sie liegt in der anderen Ecke der Stadt. Dort ist ein Fest. Ich komme spät dort hin. Darum ziehe ich die Jacke aus. Doch habe ich darunter nur ein gelbes Sporthemd, das nicht günstig aussieht. Ich überlege, ob ich es auch ausziehen soll und mit nacktem Oberkörper tanzen. Denn aus der Garderobe vor dem Eingang entnehme ich, dass alle faschingsmässig gekleidet sind. Erwachen: Billchen hat Fieber und weint. (164 words)

Ich hörte Stimmen und Kinder von draussen. Die Kinder fassten mir an der Tür ins Gesicht. Ich musste lachen. Dann war Gisela da.

Diese Ruine ist umgeben von einem Kranz von edlen anderen Ruinen und wenigen heilen Bauwerken -- fast alle im Stil des Barock, nur eines -- mit erhabener Ruhe und Klarheit und unzerstört scheint einer anderen Zeit zu entstammen, obwohl es auf die selben ovalen und runden Grundrissen erbaut ist. Dann bin ich in der Asamskirche. Nackte Genien tanzen über die schmiedeeisernen Gitter. Ich finde sie später irgendwo auf einer Empore als wächserne Barockpuppen. Eine Frau begegnet mir im Gestühl. Sie scheint dort als Kunstgeschichtlerin zu arbeiten und erzählt mir von ihren Selbstmordversuchen. Ich frage sie: "Hören Sie Stimmen?" Sie wird verlegen, doch gibt mir dann ein modifiziertes Stimmenhören zu. (149 words)

Über dem Esstisch, an dem geizige Leute sassen, die sich ihre Wurstscheiben in die Suppe zählten, hing ein alter Kronleuchter -- ein zweiter in dem weniger breiten anderen Ende des Raumes.

Dann Blättern in einer Illustrierten. Zuweilen werden die Bilder zu wirklichen Szenen. So elegante Frauen. Dann ein Polizist, der mit seinem Auto -- Brückenbruch -- in den Strom stürzt, sein Leben und das anderer nur retten kann, indem er sich die Zunge abschneidet, wie es zuerst heisst. Ich bin verärgert über diese Heldengeschichte. Dann heisst es, er habe sich die Zunge nur geritzt, um nicht zu ertrinken. Offenbar wäre er sonst an ihr erstickt. Es ist in dem Traum sehr in der Schwebe und wechselt häufig, wie weit die Szenen, Bilder und Texte der Illustrierten, wie weit sie wirkliches Geschehen sind. (148 words)

Andere Szene: Mein Bett steht fast im Freien in einer heiteren Gegend. Über mir sehe ich Türme und Kuppeln des Schweriner Schlosses, als ragte mein Bett gleichsam in seinen Hof oder einen Vorhof. Es ist eine anmutige, wenngleich etwas kitschige Architektur, die ich über mir sehe. Auf dem unten fensterlosen Rundturm sind bis zur Kuppel Figuren aufgemalt, nackte liegende Frauen. Hier wechselt die Szene: In einem Atelier, in dem die unterste dieser Frauen nackt daliegt und gemalt wird. Es bleibt aber dasselbe Bild, hat sich unmerklich gewandelt. Die Szene wandelt sich erneut oder kompliziert sich so, dass dieses Atelier zugleich ein Filmatelier wird, in dem jene Szene des Malens aufgenommen wird. Die Nackte ist sehr schön und mir sehr vertraut. Ihr Vater scheint der Regisseur zu sein. Es folgt ein Gespräch mit dem Sohn des Regisseurs, in den sich wohl die Figur inzwischen verwandelt hat. (Alle diese Verwandlungen fallen mir im Traum gar nicht als Verwandlungen auf). Es ist einfach so. Das Verhältnis von Vater und Sohn gleicht dem von Vater und Sohn Enke. (219 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1554 (1955-05-05 - Freiburg)Traum von Fr. P. Zuerst las sie mir Selbstmordgeschichten aus einer Illustrierten vor, woraus ich abnahm, dass ihre Suizidtendenzen sich wieder verstärkt hätten. Dann in der Anstalt. Es war derselbe Arzt, Dr. Klug, der sie in Emmendingen behandelt, aber eine andere Anstalt. Hier bekam sie Spritzen gegen ihre Suizidtendenz, die er im Gespräch mit ihr kurz als I. Bezeichnete, und andere, er nannte sie E, mit der Wirkung der Elektroschocks. Sie beherrschte dies Abkürzungen, und er sagte bloss zu ihr: "Wir müssen mal wieder etwas I anwenden", und erklärte mir: "Wir müssen uns mit unseren Patienten in einem solchen Abkürzungssystem unterhalten. Das verstehen sie und darauf gehen sie ein", - was mir für Schizophrene sehr einleuchtete. Überhaupt war das Gespräch zwischen uns ein sehr freundschaftliches, und er wollte mich nun in den Raum mitnehmen, in dem die Elektroschocks ausgeführt wurden. Das kenne ich ja längst, meinte er. Ich verneinte, bat ihn aber, mich gerade mitzunehmen. Szenenwechsel: Statt Klugs war nun Binswanger der Arzt, der mich zur Visite mitgenommen hatte. Ich war schon vor ihm in dem Zimmer, in dem sich schizophrene Kinder befanden, Babies, die ich zunächst für völlig kontaktlos hielt. Sie sprachen aber mit mir, turnten in den Betten rum, und der eine sagte schelmisch zu mir "Onkel, Du musst jetzt meine Reflexe prüfen." Eine ältere ausgemergelte Frau, wohl selbst eine Patientin, versorgte die Kinder. Dann erschien Binswanger. Merkwürdigerweise war meine Hose aufgeknöpft, was mir peinlich war, und der Gürtel geöffnet. Doch er zog sich seine Jacke aus und öffnete seinen Schlips, was mir gute Gelegenheit gab, unauffällig meine Kleider zu ordnen. In diesem Moment nahm er zum Teil die Züge des Sohnes Enke an. Ich blieb noch länger bei den Kindern, als er die Visite fortsetzte. Es war sehr heiss und Sturm -- alle Türen zu den Patientenzimmern standen offen. (302 words)

Die Kuh hatte sich in einen ganz kleinen Panther verwandelt, der blitzschnell über die Lichtung lief -- behielt dabei aber ihr Wesen als Kuh, so dass sie nicht als gefährlich zu gelten brauchte. Doch, da Geschwindigkeit und Wendigkeit des Tieres immer unheimlicher wurde, und da es auch -- was Kühe nicht tun würden -- ab und zu im Wald verschwand und um die Bäume Hacken schlug, sicherte ich mich schon, um notfalls auf einen Baum zu klettern, - zumal das Tier trotz seiner grossen Geschwindigkeit immer engere Kreise um mich zog.

Ein langer Gang, an dessen Ende der Speisesaal. An der Tür eine Speisekarte mit hohen Preisen. Mein Menu kostet dreizehn Franken und mehr. Erst Nachmittags gegen ein halb vier wird es billiger -- etwa elf Franken. Auf dem Rückweg durch den langen Gang komme ich an einer ausgemergelten Frau vorbei, die in einer Fensternische sitzt und einen Schwan füttert. Sie wisse, dass das sehr gefährlich sei, aber sie könne es trotzdem nicht lassen, sagte sie zu mir. Die Insel im Traum war, glaube ich, Sylt. Es war von Damm und Eisenbahn die Rede -- aber wir wollten im Boot herüberfahren. Eine einfache Frau wollte uns begleiten. Auch Gregor überlegte, ob er mitfahren sollte. (146 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1558 (1955-05-24 - Freiburg)"Die Geschichte der Wunderdoktors T. und derjenigen, die noch bedenkenloser sind als er" -: so ähnlich hiess der Titel eines Buches, das in der Vorhalle der Universität (oben) ausgestellt war. Bender hielt es für sehr gefährlich, dass dieses Buch schon während der Untersuchung in Freiburg verkauft wurde. Später erschien ein Artikel in der Zeitung, der ausgesprochen gegen T. hetzte und dabei unlauter war. Was sollte er erst über diesen denken! Ich fuhr einen Autobus durch die Stadt und über die Kreuzung an der Karthäuser-Strasse, der die Mitglieder der Untersuchung nach oben bringen sollte. Ich nahm aber unterwegs keine Patienten mit, obwohl sie humpelten und noch etwas Platz war, weil ich nicht wusste, ob es den anderen recht war. Später war es ein schweres Lastauto, das ich zu steuern hatte. Ich beherrschte die Mechanik des Autos ganz gut. Man musste gleichzeitig das Steuerrad führen, eine Handbremse drehen -- wie den Hebel einer Drehpresse -- und zwei Fussbremsen bedienen. Zuletzt aber gelang es mir doch nicht, den schweren Wagen auf abschüssiger Strasse ganz zu bremsen. Ich steuerte seitlich, zwischen anderen Wagen hindurch, kam aber doch nicht frei und wurde schliesslich von einem umstürzenden -- nun nicht mehr Wagen, sondern: Pferd -- fast erdrückt. Auch Hunde spielten im weiteren Traumverlauf eine Rolle. Die Szene war jetzt von Tieren beherrscht. (216 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1561 (1955-06-06 - Nagold)Besuch bei Picasso. Er spricht mit mir hauptsächlich über mathematische Probleme, wobei es mir oft schwierig ist, seiner französischen Terminologie zu folgen. Von Rechteck, Quadrat und Diagonale ist die Rede. Er frägt auch examinierend über bestimmte Verhältnisse. Hat aber Ähnlichkeit mit Binswanger. Rot und der Ton u sind in seiner Umgebung vorherrschend. So spricht er alle Vokale -- auch das o -- fast wie ein helles u aus, dabei betont mit der Hand gestikulierend. Dazu ist überall rot verbreitet, das dem von Emmes "Picasso-Rock" entspricht. Eine Frau, die als andere Gesprächspartnerin bei ihm ist, spricht ihn mehr auf andere, nicht mathematische Verhältnisse an. So Gespräch über die Modelle. Picasso bemerkt von dem einen, es habe gerade heute Geburtstag gehabt. Er hat nämlich auf ihrem Kleid eingenäht Monogramm und Geburtsdaten entdeckt. Andere Szene: Später erscheint Picasso noch einmal und fordert mich auf, an einer Zirkuszene teilzunehmen. Ich solle vom hohen Ross herunterspringen. Man sieht im Hintergrund eine Art Giraffe und eine tiefe Grube, in die es hinabzuspringen gilt. Erst neulich hat sich einer das Genick dabei gebrochen. Auch hier sind leuchtend rote Farben. Ich weigere mich entschieden, ich wolle lieber gar nicht erst "aufs hohe Ross" steigen, dann brauche ich auch nicht herunterspringen. Akrobaten seien dafür geeigneter. Picasso ist ärgerlich: Dann habe man wieder diese ausdruckslosen Gesichter, und ich solle ganz ruhig sein, dass ich nicht auf dem hohen Ross sässe, wäre nicht der Fall. Ich halte aber meine Weigerung aufrecht, schiele aber heimlich nach der Möglichkeit, doch noch zu springen. Andere Szene war vorausgegangen: Komplizierte und doch frappierend einfache technische Anlage in einem Tal zur Geländeverbesserung für einen Strassenbau. Grosse Räder drehen sich schattenwerfend vor einer Lichtquelle. Weiter hinten irgendwo im undurchdringlichen Wald steht auf demselben Strahl ein zweites Rad, das den Strahl ein zweites Mal mit seinem Schatten unterbricht. Dabei kann der Rhythmus der beiden Räder so aufeinander abgestimmt werden, dass sich die Schatten jeweils verstärken und decken, oder nicht, wenn sie genau gerade voreinander stehen. Auf diese Weise wird die gerade Strassenlinie Nachts mit grossen Strecken durch den ungebahnten Wald so optisch vorgezeichnet. -- Dies alles geschieht heimlich und in kurzer Zeit.

Ich fand ihn durch Keller und Hintertüren. (78 words)

Auch mein Bruder ist bei dem Mann in Behandlung und hat die Bürste in Gedanken ins Zahnputzglas gesteckt. Ich bitte den Mann, sie sorgfältig wieder zurecht zu biegen, weil sie mir am Herzen läge. Dann wache ich auf (im Traum) und begreife, wie wichtig dieser mein erster Traum als Initialtraum für die Behandlung sein muss. Ich beginne, ihn sorgfältig aufzuschreiben, kann dabei aber nicht auf den Namen des Psychotherapeuten kommen, der nicht mit dem Dr. Steinbach in der Goethe-Strasse identisch ist. Er heisst, glaube ich, Schulz. Ich setze also da in Klammern dazu: "Name vergessen". Das ist mir peinlich, denn daraus muss er ersehen, wie sehr ich die Verbindung zu ihm verdränge. Ihm war es dagegen peinlich (in der vorhergehenden Szene, dass er meine, beziehungsweise meiner Eltern Möbel hatte.) -- Dann wache ich richtig auf, bemerke nun, dass ich noch gar nichts geschrieben habe, dass es den Psychotherapeuten gar nicht gibt und ich auch nicht in Behandlung bin.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1566 (1955-06-17 - Freiburg)Traum von Binswanger (indirekt) und von Enke (dem Sohn des bekannten Psychiaters). Erste Szene: Fahrt mit Emme in einer hohen Strassenbahn durch eine Stadt wie Konstanz an der Schweizer Grenze. Die Fahrt ging über geländerlose Brücken. Ganz tief unten die Kanäle. Emme fürchtete, wir könnten in diese herabstürzen. Ich dagegen sah die Gefahr in den Fahrzeugen, die tief unter uns -- ganz kleine Autos, denn die Strassenbahn war überhoch, -- auf die Schienen gerieten. Doch es ging alles gut. Die Bahn hielt nach einer grossen Kurve an einem Kanal bei einem Park entlang der Schweizer Grenze, und wir konnten aussteigen. Wir begaben uns in den Park und verfehlten den gesuchten Grenzübergang, um zu Binswanger zu kommen, fanden aber dann einen anderen, näher im Park gelegenen. Szenenwechsel: In einem Hotel in der selben Stadt. Auch Enke ist dort untergebracht. Er kommt durch eine Seitentür in mein Zimmer und wir klöhnen miteinander. Später bin ich auf die selbe Weise in seinem Zimmer. Doch auf dem Rückweg verliere ich mich in ein sehr luxuriöses Zimmer, das ich für das meine hielt, weil ich irrtümlich annahm, dass Enkes und meine Zimmer nebeneinander lägen. Erst als ich die Sachen niederlegte, merkte ich, dass das Zimmer, das praktisch zwischen Enkes und meinem lag, das falsche und von einer älteren Dame bewohnt war. Ich hätte dagegen über einen Gang gehen müssen. Im Hinausgehen entdeckte ich in einer Nische eingebaut ein sehr luxuriöses in den Boden eingelassenes rundes Bad mit schwarzen Kacheln, das mir sehr gefiel. (248 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1567 (1955-06-19 - Freiburg)Ich kam per Anhalter in eine fremde Stadt -- ich glaube Düsseldorf -, für die mir Gisela eine Adresse von Verwandten gegeben hatte. Ich näherte mich nun -- etwa benommen -- nach so vielen Jahren dem Haus, in dem sie wohnen mussten. Es war ein schlossartiges Gebäude mit vielen Etagen, Flügeln und Eingängen. Ich klingelte schliesslich an einer Tür und fragte, als sich oben ein Fenster öffnete, nach "Oberkonsistorialrat Schneider", so hiess der Mann - . Glücklicherweise hatte ich die richtige Klingel gedrückt und den richtigen Eingang gefunden, denn es war seine Frau, die das Fenster geöffnet hatte. Nun hörte ich von oben Giselas lautes und unbefangenes Lachen. Sie war durch einen Zufall auch gerade jetzt bei diesen Verwandten. Ich war sehr erleichtert und überglücklich. (125 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1568 (1955-06-20 - Freiburg)Ich fuhr in einer Strassenbahn, in der auch Biene Bauch auf der Plattform stand. Dabei sass eine Katze. Später war es ein Autobus. Der Fahrer schien die Gewalt über sein Fahrzeug zu verlieren, das zwar noch sehr langsam, aber etwas richtungslos fuhr. Ich sprang ab und ging zu Fuss weiter. Dann kam ich zur Universität der Stadt, die im Stil dem Gebäude der Göttinger Aula glich. Ich stieg die Treppen hinauf, um in die zentral gelegene Aula zu gelangen. Doch war ich offenbar eine Treppe zu hoch gestiegen, denn ich kam in immer neue, sehr gepflegte klassizistische Räume (wie im Göttinger Rektorat), die an der Stelle der Aula lagen. Zuletzt in einen zentral gelegenen Raum, in dem ein nacktes Mädchen war. Sie war gerade dabei, sich umzuziehen. Es war eine sehr unbefangene, frische Natur, die keinerlei Umstände machte. Ich konnte der Versuchung nicht widerstehen und berührte ihren Körper, obwohl ich verheiratet war. Dann zog ich sie zu mir auf ein Liegebett, das mit einer Wolldecke bedeckt war. Zu dieser Zeit hörte man draussen Geräusche. Ein Mann suchte den Eingang zu diesem Raum. Dann hörte ich, wie Frau Böhringers Mutter erklärte: "Der Raum wird abgeschlossen sein; um diese Zeit pflegen die Herren sich dorthin zurückzuziehen." Der Mann ging aber trotzdem zur Tür, fand sie offen und kam hinein, um irgend etwas zu suchen. Ich zog die Wolldecke über das Mädchen, so dass es nicht mehr zu sehen war, und über mich so weit, dass es aussah, als ob ich mich gerade aus dem Schlaf aufgerichtet hätte. Der Herr, ein Akademiker mittleren Alters, entschuldigte sich höflich und suchte seine Sachen in dem Raum zusammen. Das Mädchen versuchte sich immer wieder aufzurichten, offenbar nicht begreifend, dass sie unter der Decke gut versteckt war. Ich drückte sie dann sanft nieder. -- Szenenwechsel: Ich näherte mich jetzt von aussen und von der anderen Seite -- nämlich von links -- dem Gebäude, das von einem urtümlichen Haufen von Steintrümmern, Ruinen umgeben war, als wenn die Erde um es herum aufgebrochen wäre. Die Annäherung gelang nur mühsam,und wir gerieten seitab in das Trümmerfeld. Ich weiss nicht mehr, wer mich begleitete. Als wir das Haus erreichten, stand schon eine sehr technisierte Such- und Hilfsstation mit Strahlungssendern und ähnlichem bereit, da man uns offenbar schon aufgegeben hatte. Das Trümmerfeld, in das wir uns begeben hatten, schien sehr gefährlich und von elementaren Strahlen bedroht. Das Gebäude, in dem die Station in einem quadratischen Raum eingerichtet war, war immer noch das selbe in Stil und Bauweise der Göttinger Aula. Der Wissenschaftler wirkte sehr modern und etwas amerikanisch. (426 words)

Ich liess ihr einmal durch den Pförtner Blumen schicken, die ich in der Stadt gekauft hatte, ohne noch zu wissen für wen. Mit den Patienten verkehrte man durch den Pförtner. Ich wollte die Blumen zuerst einer jungen Frau schicken, deren Ankunft ich erlebt hatte, konnte aber ihre Zimmernummer nicht ermitteln, da über der Portierloge nur die nackten Zahlen standen. Ich sah auch unter den Patienten dort eine sehr schöne Frau in durchsichtigem Nachthemd. Ich war nur leicht krank und konnte jederzeit mit irgend einer Taxe in die Stadt fahren. So hatte ich auch die Blumen geholt, einen bunten Strauss, der Glockenblumen und Fingerhut-ähnliche Blüten enthielt. Ich hatte auch einen eigenen Wagen, den ich vor dem Bahnhof parkte, um mit dem Taxi zurückzufahren. Das Taxi fuhr mir weg, weil ich noch zweimal zurücklief, um erst die linke, dann die noch vergessene rechte Wagentür zu verschliessen. (161 words)

Sie waren alle viel zu weit für meine schmalen Füsse. Schliesslich fand ich ein Paar, das mir passte. Eigentlich war es eine Kindergrösse. Aber es waren keine richtigen Holzpantoffeln. Sie waren weiss gestrichen und wie Schuhe über einer Sohle gearbeitet, die mir von Holz zu sein schien. Oben waren sie wie Mokassins und aus grobem Leder. -- Aber auch die Sohle war -- wie sich herausstellte, nicht aus Leder, sondern aus weichem porigen Krepp. Die Schuhe waren sehr leicht und sassen wie angegossen meinem Fuss. Ich wollte sie haben, aber Müller sagte ärgerlich: "Ach was, das sind gar keine richtigen Holzpantoffeln." -- Andere Szene: Ein sehr junges Mädchen -- die Tochter des bäuerlichen oder ländlichen Hauses -- mit aufgelösten schwarzen Haaren, die sie kämmt. Ich erklärte ihr, dass die Pantoffeln mir nicht gut stehen würden. Meine dünnen Beine würden darin aussehen wie Entenfüsse. Das Mädchen war aber sehr jung, und konnte auf den Scherz nicht eingehen, sondern wurde verlegen. Ich hatte sie wohl nur ihrer schönen schwarzen Haare wegen älter geschätzt. (204 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1576 (1955-06-29 - Freiburg)In Hamburg, wo ich per Anhalter gelandet bin, spät am Abend an einer Strassenbahnhaltestelle. Dort treffe ich ganz zufällig Tante Tabitha. Sie ist -- in ihrer Art -- ganz entsetzt, dass ich mich nicht angemeldet habe. Sie begreift nicht, dass das beim Anhalterfahren nicht möglich ist und auch gar nicht dazu passt. Ich suche also eine Telefonzelle, um Gisela anzurufen, zu der ich auch eigentlich wollte. Ich sehe mir die Umgegend an, um den Ort, von dem ich telefoniere, beschreiben zu können. Ganz dicht beeinander stehen drei grosse gotische Kirchen aus verschiedenen Zeiten. Die Stadt nimmt hier einen ganz fremden Charakter an. Einzig bekannt noch ist der Name einer U-Bahnstation namens Paschwitz, in der aber die Züge durchfahren. Szenenwechsel: Auch Emme ist nun dabei -- es geht viele Stufen hinauf zu einer Kirche. Ich erkenne sie: es ist der Schweriner Dom, und bin sehr ergriffen von dem Wiedersehen mit der Kirche, von der ich so oft geträumt habe. Emme bleibt etwas hinter mir zurück im Steigen der Treppe. Dann gehen wir durch winklige Strassen in ein winkliges Haus mit vielen Gängen. Hier bemerken meine Begleiter, dass Emme nicht mitgekommen ist , und gehen vor die Tür, um nach ihr zu schauen. Ich bleibe noch eine Weile, um noch nicht zu erleben, was ich befürchte, dass sie sich ganz verlaufen hat. Doch es ist so, sie muss in den winkligen Strassen völlig die Richtung verloren haben. Ich laufe hinaus durch die Strassen der grossen fremden Stadt und rufe: "Emme, Emme!", ohne sie zu finden. So sehe ich für uns beide eine einsame Nacht kommen und bin sehr unglücklich. (267 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1577 (1955-06-29 - Freiburg)Vor einer Vorlesung, die Szilasi halten sollte, ging ich in den Hörsaal, belegte meinen Stammplatz, der ganz hinten in der letzten Reihe war, und ging wieder hinaus vor die Tür, zu der einige Stufen hinaufführten, und setzte mich dort hin und beobachtete das Treiben auf dem Gang. D. unterhielt sich mit einem alten Professor, der über seine Gebrechlichkeit klagte. Er könne die Stufen kaum mehr steigen. D. erinnerte ihn an die alte Frau Öhlkers, die noch so behende herumlief. Beide sassen während des Gesprächs neben mir auf dem Treppenabsatz. Ich hatte einen kleinen Ball, mit dem ich spielte, und der mir gerade die Treppe runtergerollt war, als Christian Ferber kam, der wie ich zu meiner Freude sah, an seinen Füssen Sandalen trug (denn früher hatte er immer nur Reitstiefel getragen). Ich rufe ihm zu: "Ich habe unsere Stammplätze belegt" und gehe mit ihm hinein, um ihm die Sitze zu zeigen. Dann will ich noch einmal hinausgehen, um den Ball zu holen, doch sehe ich schon einen Mann zum Katheder schreiten. Es ist D. . Er nennt eine Reihe von Namen und beginnt mit den Worten: "Vernehmen Sie den Artikel so und so aus der Verordnung so und so." Auf die erstaunte Frage, was das solle, erklärt er dem Auditorium, die Betreffenden wären beordert, den Artikel zu lesen, und er wollte ihnen die Arbeit erleichtern. -- Doch ehe er begann, stand in der Tür eine Reihe von Professoren. D. wich zwar nicht vom Katheder, machte aber "pscht" mit dem Mund, worauf das Auditorium völlig still war in einem etwas beklemmenden Schweigen. Einer der Professoren, der aber keine Vorlesung zu halten hatte, schritt auf D. zu. Ich sagte schliesslich laut zu meinem Nachbarn Ferber: "Ich weiss gar nicht, warum wir eigentlich ruhig sein sollten." Der Professor sagte einige Worte in tonloser Lippenbewegung zu D. und wandte sich dann mir zu, wobei ich ihn als katholischen Theologen erkannte. Er sagte zu mir in tonhaften und deutlichen Worten: "Die bedeutendsten theologischen Arbeiten wurden von Leuten gemacht, die...".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1578 (1955-07-01 - Freiburg)"Wer wohl diesen Spaten wieder liegen hat lassen ", sagte ein Polizist zu mir, der an der Gabel zweier Wege stand, und hielt einen Feldspaten hoch, den er auf dem Rasendreieck zwischen den schräg zueinander laufenden Wegen gefunden hatte. Einer seiner Kollegen hatte ihn liegen gelassen. Der kleinere Weg führte gleichzeitig einen Hang hinab, so dass das Rasendreieck den Hang herab geneigt war. Es war mit Stacheldraht überzogen, zwischen dem der Polizist während seiner Rede herabstieg, um eine Radfahrerin zu ermahnen, die unten falsch fuhr. Ich versuchte, ihm zu folgen, da auch er den verbotenen Weg direkt über den Rasen herabstieg, doch bohrten sich immer wieder die Dornen des Stacheldrahts in meine Füsse und Fesseln. Das war sehr schmerzhaft (ich spürte den Schmerz deutlich und lebhaft im Traum!) und ich zog die Füsse jeweils vorsichtig zurück, während der Polizist ungehindert hinab kam. Ich war noch nicht unten, als sich das Rasenstück in ein Feld von Grabgewölben verwandelte, das zu einem Bauerndorf gehörte. Ich liess mich in ein Grabgewölbe herab, aus dem ich nur mühsam wieder hinaus kam. Die Särge waren in malerischen Strohkörben kleeblattförmig drinnen aufgestellt. Ich zog mich recht mühsam durch die Einstieglucke nach oben. (196 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1580 (1955-07-02 - Freiburg)Im Vorraum eines modernen gläsernen Hörsaals, in dem man Professoren und Studenten in jeder Bewegung auch von aussen sehen kann. Drinnen ein Jurist, Fachmann für das BGB, der die Eigenheit hat, keine ganzen Sätze zu dulden. Er will nur Stichworte und streicht alle ganzen Sätze auf den Blättern seiner Hörer durch, weil sie die Konzentration und praktische Kürze verdürben. Ich bin entsetzt über diese Eigenmächtigkeit, die mir unakademisch erscheint, und erkläre einem der bei mir stehenden Juristen, dass ich das nicht dulden, sondern diesen Professor boykottieren würde. Er erklärt mir, das sei nicht möglich, weil dieser ein Monopol für das BGB besitze. Ich setze mich an den Rand des Hörsaals und schaue durch die Glaswand dem Treiben des Mannes zu, der in seiner radikalen Kürze und Prägnanz an Mendes France erinnert und mir darin imponiert. -- Während mein Interesse wächst, gehe ich ein Stück um den Hörsaal herum und setze mich direkt in seinem Rücken hinter das Katheder, so dass mich nur noch die Glaswand von ihm trennt, er aber hinter sich mich nicht bemerken kann. Er ist inzwischen auf die Frage der Grenze einzelner Wissenschaft und ihrer Zusammenfassung gekommen. Mitten in der Rede dreht er sich plötzlich um, erblickt mich und stellt mir eine gerade reif gewordene Frage über das Verhältnis von Völkerkunde und Geschichte, die es in eine Einheit zu bringen gilt. Ich antworte ihm, der in der Frage die Züge des Orientalisten Krückmann angenommen hat, die Einheit sei im Begriff des Volkes zu suchen. (247 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1581 (1955-07-05 - Freiburg)Per Anhalter bin ich gegen Abend nach Northeim gekommen, wo ich drei Kirchen sehe, zwei neugotische und eine offenbar auch nicht alte barocke. Eine der drei Kirchen hat neuerdings eine grosse Betonkuppel. Mir kommt dabei (im Traum!) in den Sinn, dass ich neulich geträumt hatte, diese Kirche sei eine Kuppelkirche, und nun finde ich diesen Traum in Beton verwirklicht. Dann begegnet mir ein Student, der mir erklärt, dass hier in Northeim jetzt die Universität geschlossen sei -- sie sei wegen ihres Luxuslebens eingegangen. Mir fällt dazu -- wiederum im Traum -- ein, dass ich kürzlich etwas Merkwürdiges mit Explosionen verbundenes von dieser Betonuniversität geträumt habe, dass sich nun hier auf diese Weise erfüllt. Während des Gesprächs bemerke ich plötzlich, dass ich meinen Koffer im Philosophischen Seminar in Göttingen stehen gelassen habe. Überdies ist es Nacht geworden, und ich kann nicht damit rechnen, noch per Anhalter in Richtung Freiburg (in welcher Richtung im Traum Northeim liegt, etwa wie Offenburg) noch fortzukommen. So frage ich den Studenten nach Quartier und erwache. -- Die Szene zuvor spielte eigentlich gar nicht im Philosophischen Seminar in Göttingen, obwohl es in der Erinnerung der Northeimer Szene so war, sondern in einer aus Wittmoldt und der Atmosphäre philosophischer Seminare überhaupt gemischten Räumlichkeit.

Er betastete mein Gesicht, denn er war blind und wollte sich nun ein genaues Bild von mir verschaffen. Im Erwachen oder direkt danach verwunderte mich, dass er als Blinder eine Reise nach Afrika machen wollte, wo er doch nichts sehen könnte, nur die Wärme geniessen. Dann aber schien es mir möglich, dass sein Blindsein eine unterschiedene Szene gewesen sei, das heisst, dass ich ihn während des Gesprächs über die Reise nach Afrika noch nicht als blind geträumt habe, denn im Traum selbst war mir diese Ungereimtheit nicht aufgefallen, was dafür spräche, dass zwischen beiden ein Szenenwechsel stattgefunden habe. Alle diese Überlegungen machte ich direkt nach dem Erwachen in einer Art Halbschlaf. (147 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1600 (1955-08-13 - Freiburg)Besuch von einem jungen protestantischen Erzbischof. Er hat ein blumiges schwarzes Gewand über den Hosen, das genau Emmes Morgenrock gleicht. Später steigt er ins Auto, kommt aber noch einmal zurück, weil er etwas vergessen hat, und erscheint nun ohne die Hosen unter dem Mantel. Er hat sie offenbar zum Fahren ausgezogen. (51 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1601 (1955-09-08 - Freiburg)Komplizierte Träume. Zuerst von den Kindern des Kaufmanns, dessen Haus wir heimlich umräumten. Es war aber zugleich etwas Verbotenes. Die Szene wechselte dann so, dass es Emmes Geschwister waren. E. ging mit dem Messer auf uns los wie ein Amokläufer. Ich wehrte mich mit vorgehaltenen Stühlen und anderen Gegenständen. Nun wechselte die Szene wieder. Das Haus war jetzt Benders Haus und die Kinder Benders Kinder und die Angriffsszene hatte ich nur geträumt. Ich bemerkte aber, dass der Junge, der jetzt Christian hiess, genau das selbe geträumt hatte. Also war es ein telepathischer Traum. Ich bat ihn, den Traum aufzuschreiben, ehe ich den meinen aufschrieb und in Details erzählte, und erhoffte so ein gutes Experiment. Dann aber wachte ich langsam ganz auf und bemerkte, dass auch die Parallelität der Träume nur von mir geträumt war. Nun verlor ich das Interesse am Aufschreiben, bis ich so weit wach wurde, dass ich den Reiz auch dieses Traumes erkannte. (155 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1602 (1955-09-13 - Freiburg)Marion, die uns besuchte. Ich war noch immer ganz verliebt und suchte ihren Blick, so oft ich konnte. Sie wohnte bei uns im Zimmer und die Atmosphäre hatte etwas Heiteres und Verspieltes. Sie blätterte in einer grossen, wohl psychologischen Examensarbeit. Später war sie mit Emme zusammen in einem Badezimmer, unter dessen Fenster unten ich in einer Sitzwanne sass. Sie guckten heraus und scherzten. Auch ein drittes Gesicht erschien in dem Fenster: Inge . Andere Szene: Wir sind alle mit Billchen in der Strassenbahn. Ich nehme Billchen auf den Schoss. Emme und Marion sitzen zusammen. (94 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1605 (1955-09-14 - Freiburg)Ein Mann, der -- selber Arzt -- zu einem älteren berühmten Arzt ging, weil er in der Folge einer Operation merkwürdige seelische Störungen bekommen hatte, die er zuerst psychogen zu erklären suchte, dann aber bemerkte, dass sie organischer Herkunft sein mussten. Wir standen um den Tisch des älteren Arztes herum, der Patient, andere Assistenten und ich. Der ältere Arzt war Steinbach. Die folgende Szene handelte von "Herrn von Vieregge-Wittmoldt" (statt: "Bülow-Wittmoldt", bzw.: "Vieregge-Steinhausen"). (73 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1606 (1955-09-14 - Freiburg)Ich fuhr auf der Schlossbergstrasse mit einer Art Schlittenboot aus Plastik oder ähnlichem, das herrlich auf dem glatten Asphalt entlang glitt. Es wurde mit einem Motor betrieben und bewegte sich etwa wie ein Eissegler. Ein junges Mädchen setzte sich zu mir. Es trug einen kleinen Bikinibadeanzug und war herrlich gebaut -- besonders der Venusberg formte sich sehr deutlich unter dem Stoff des Badeanzugs ab, und ihr Unterleib war geformt wie der der Aurora von Michelangelo. Wir gehörten zu einer Art Gesellschaft oder Schule, in deren Pausen man auf der Strasse dort wandeln konnte. Ein älterer Herr, der ebenfalls dazu gehörte, wollte sich auch mit auf mein Schlittenboot setzen. Das Mädchen kam deshalb nach vorne auf die Spitze direkt vor mich, damit der Mann hinten sitzen konnte. Sie schmiegte sich in mich ein, und ich rutschte so weit nach vorne, dass sie fast in mich gepresst war, und weidete meine Hände in ihrer Scham. Sie legte ihre braunen Beine vorne über die äusserste Spitze des Bootes. Der Schlitten glitt mit ungeheurer Geschwindigkeit durch die jetzt verkehrsreich gewordene Strasse. Es gelang mir aber, ihn sehr wendig durch alles hindurchzusteuern. Wir hatten uns dabei weiter als sonst vom Ausgangspunkt entfernt, und ich konnte, da die Schlossbergstrasse eine Einbahnstrasse ist, nicht auf demselben Wege zurückkehren. So bog ich mit unserem Schlittenboot nach links ein und suchte den Weg zurück durch die Konviktstrasse. Der Unterricht oder Vortrag hatte schon wieder begonnen. Wir benutzten die Gelegenheit, um hinter dem älteren Herrn, der ja mit uns gefahren war, hineinzuschlüpfen. Nun war aber noch ein dritter Mann da, gleichsam die andere Hälfte des anderen Manns, ein junger, sehr muskulöser und braungebrannter Mann, zu dem das Mädchen Beziehungen gehabt zu haben schien, die sie aber meinetwegen einschlafen liess. Er war fast nackt, nur mit einem kleinen Dreieckshöschen bekleidet und liess sich, während wir schon hineingingen und sie ihm noch etwas zurief, in ein merkwürdig tiefes brunnenartiges Becken herab, offenbar um sich zu waschen. Das viereckige Becken war so tief, dass der Wasserspiegel mannstief unter dem Rande stand. (338 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1608 (1955-09-18 - Freiburg)In der Kirche. Der Prediger, den ich schon früher durch Gespräche kannte, lief während seiner Predigt von der Kanzel herunter und stellte Fragen an Einzelne aus der Gemeinde. Er lief dabei sehr impulsiv zwischen den Bänken hin und her. So fragte er etwas über den subjektiven und den objektiven Pol der Gemeinde. Auf eine Fangfrage, das heisst eine Frage, deren Antwort so selbstverständlich war, dass man sie nicht zu geben wagte, sagte ich, ich hätte ihren Sinn nicht verstanden. Er war dadurch etwas düpiert, aber um so mehr erfreut, als ich die Antwort "das Selbe" danach noch gab. (98 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1609 (1955-09-25 - Freiburg)Merkwürdige Wohnungsverhältnisse, die ich noch nicht ganz durchschaute. Am Ende des platzartigen Korridors öffnete ich eine Tür. Dort wohnte eine Schwester von Gesine. Sie hatte aber nicht tiefschwarze Haare wie Heike, sondern leuchtend blonde, sie war überhaupt wie eine völlige Übertragung von Heike ins Blonde. Auch die grossen dunklen Augen Heikes hatten hier ein ganz anderes Licht. Es war eine Schönheit, und wir hatten sofort ein Verhältnis des Einverständnisses zueinander, das mich noch nach dem Erwachen berührte. Ich geriet sozusagen aus Versehen in das Zimmer und spürte mich von einem Blick angezogen, fühlte mich darin wie zu Hause. Später sah ich in der Wohnung einen fremden südländischen Mann, ein wenig wie ein Südamerikaner, mir sehr fremd. Ich fragte ihn, was er hier wolle. Er sagte: "Ich bin aus dem Zimmer gekommen" und schien mit der Schwester Gesines verheiratet zu sein. Auf dem Flur war ein grosser Hund, der mich ansprang und sich fest um meinen Oberkörper legte und mit der Schnauze nach meinem Gesicht griff. Ich konnte ihn nicht loswerden und rief laut um Hilfe. Gesines Mann kam aus seinem Zimmer und wollte sofort zugreifen. Ich hielt das aber für zu gefährlich und bat ihn, noch mehr Hilfe herbeizuholen. Jungens, Schulkinder mit spitzen Waffen wollten mich angreifen. Sie nahmen es fanatisch ernst. Es war auf einer Strasse, und da ich Angst um den Hund hatte, der noch immer um meinen Hals lag, rief ich Bauarbeiter, die neben uns die Strassenbäume beschnitten, um Hilfe an. Sie bewegten sich jedoch nur mit der Langsamkeit von alten Gärtnern. Dann kamen Polizisten, die die Jungens verhörten und alles genau registrierten, so die Art der Waffen, die sie in H-Waffen und L-Waffen einteilten. Die Jungens hatten Dickens gelesen und dorther ihre Kampfidee übernommen. Von ihm stammte auch die Einteilung der Waffen, der sich die Polizisten bedienten. Mein erster Angreifer war als letzter immer noch unbewältigt und attackierte mich von neuem. Ich brach seine Waffe ein und knickte den Stil in viele kleine Stücke. Darauf warf ich den Jungen, der mich mit sehr leuchtenden braunen Augen anschaute, in einem freundschaftlichen Ringkampf nieder. Die Polizei registrierte wieder alles und nahm die zerknickte Waffe als Beweis mit. Es war eine H-Waffe. (363 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1610 (1955-09-25 - Freiburg)Ein anderer Traum spielte in einem Warenhaus. Ich fuhr mit einem offenen Fahrstuhl und sah in der Etage, die ich durchfuhr, sehr schöne Mädchen stehen, darunter Gesines Schwester -- die Blonde -. Ich wollte das Bild in seiner perspektivischen Bewegung und Verschiebung vom Fahrstuhl aus filmen. Bender war irgendwie als Kameramann dabei. Nächste Szene: In der Strassenbahn: Bender jetzt in einer amerikanischen Uniform. Ich hörte ein Gesprächsbruchstück: "Ich glaube, dass es telepathische Beziehung in diesem Lande gibt" - . Es handelte sich offenbar um Indien oder Tibet. Der Partner erwiderte etwas und Bender -- etwas stolz: "Ja, ich bin ja beim Geheimdienst." Benders anderer Nebenmann, ein ebenfalls Uniformierte, der aussah wie Vittorio de Sica, dämpfte ihn etwas bestürzt: "Das dürfen Sie nicht ausplaudern." Bender war etwas betreten - lenkte das Gespräch aber schnell auf andere Themen. (136 words)

Ich sah das Schild, als es durch Freiburg fuhr, und überlegte mir, ob ich bis zur Johanniskirche mitfahren sollte. Wegen des starken Verkehrs wurde das Rütschle durch die Stadt mit Pferden gezogen. Es sah aus wie eine Pferdekutsche und hinten mit dem Schild: "Paris-Apotheke". (87 words)

Ich gehe hinaus über Höfe zu einer Art See oder Teich in einer Kiesgrube. Ein Freund sitzt jenseits auf einem Felsen über dem Wasser -- ziemlich hoch -- und liest. Das Ganze sieht aus wie ein alter, mit Wasser gefüllter Steinbruch oder eine Kiesgrube. Die Felsen sind schwarz, der Kies gelb, das Wasser trübe. Während mir der Freund Gebärden macht und ich meine Asche hinabschütte -- es ist schon Abend -l öst sich über ihm ein Felsen und trifft ihn im Rücken. Sein ganzer Sitz kommt ins Wanken. Ein zweiter Brocken schlägt an seinen Kopf. Eine Weile versucht er krampfhaft, zu balancieren. Dann stürzt auch sein Sitz in die Tiefe herab. Er wirft die Arme hoch und taucht tief in das Wasser hinab. Wird er wieder auftauchen? Wie soll ich ihn retten? Doch er hat das Bewusstsein noch nicht verloren und schwimmt an das Ufer. (159 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1614 (1955-09-30 - Freiburg)Ich las in einer Zeitung über meinen alten Lehrer Buckentin, hier Buckentini genannt, er sei der Reisebegleiter von Goethe gewesen. Auch waren Experimente und Erfindungen von ihm beschrieben in der Art Leonardo da Vincis. Ich war sehr eingenommen von dieser Beschreibung. Erst später fiel mir auf, dass er als mein Lehrer dann schon über hundert Jahre alt gewesen sein müsse, und ich dachte nun, es wäre vielleicht sein Vater gewesen. Ich erfasste dann, dass ich nur geträumt habe (vielleicht war ich zwischendurch kurz erwacht), und machte nun eine Zeichnung über meinen Traum, die sehr gut gelungen war und gleich in mehreren Exemplaren vorhanden war. Emme stellte sie beim Frühstücken an ihre Teetasse. Ich war empört darüber, denn ich fürchtete, sie werde sie bekleckern. So geschah es auch, als sie bald darauf ihre Teetasse umrührte. Szenenwechsel: In einem büroartigen Raum, der zu der Wohnung gehörte, ging von selbst das Licht an, obwohl es vorher aus gewesen war. Eine Stimme ertönte und sprach offenbar ins Telephon -- aber niemand war da. Ich war sehr betroffen von diesem Phänomen, bis ich begriff, dass es sich um hier um eine komplizierte Haustelephonanlage handelte. Wenn jemand aus einem anderen Raum nach aussen telefonieren wollte, wurde seine Stimme durch einen Lautsprecher auf den Schreibtisch übertragen, so dass sie direkt in die Sprechmuschel des Telephons tönen konnte, als ob der Sprechende gegenwärtig wäre. Auch das Licht ging automatisch an, um den Schein seiner Gegenwart zu vollenden. Unheimlich blieb mir die Erscheinung auch nach dieser Erklärung. Ich entfernte mich aus dem Zimmer mit meinen inzwischen wieder getrockneten Zeichnungen und dem Gedanken, dass Emme diese geisterhafte Erscheinung einen gehörigen und verdienten Schreck einjagen würde.

Jetzt langsam wieder Träume in Erinnerung -- meist morgens mit Geräuschen oder Aussenreizen verbunden.

Diese Dinge werden völlig identisch, wie die Perle in die Muschel, in den Traum hineingetan, als wenn sie ganz notwendig dazugehörten. Erst im Erwachen bemerkt man an ihrem Auseinanderbrechen diese Identität, und dies ist der merkwürdige Reiz dieser Träume, dass eines ihrer Elemente nicht aufhört, sondern als Stück der wachen Welt wiederkehrt.

In manchen Zimmern kann man das Alte noch rekonstruieren. Um den Saal herum, hat eine Firma, die dort untergebracht war, die alte Ordnung wieder hergestellt. Sogar die Familiengeschichte wurde festgehalten und neu die Namen an den Wänden eingraviert. Bei dieser Firma hat Müller gearbeitet. Ich gehe zur anderen Seite des Hauses hindurch, den Flügel mit dem alten Treppenhaus, und dem Zimmer, wo ich früher gewohnt habe. Hier ist alles privat.

Ich werde mit einigen anderen in eine Strassenbahn gedrängt. Die Polizisten vergessen aber, mich auszufragen. Andere Szene: Plötzlich sehe ich auf der Strasse mehrere Männer in der deutschen Generalsuniform. Der äusserste sieht aus wie Onkel Hans. Ich rufe seinen Namen, und er ist es tatsächlich.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1623 (1955-10-12 - Freiburg)Ich fahre mit einer Strassenbahn, die ich allein für mich habe. Durch Weichen auf alte, nie mehr befahrene Gleise, die sich ganz mit Staub und Erde gefüllt haben. Schliesslich springt der Wagen aus ihnen heraus und bewegt sich nun schienenlos. Ich kann ihn steuern und hocke oben auf ihm wie auf einem Pferd oder Motorrad. Er bleibt dabei der Strassenbahnwagen. Rechts ist ein künstlicher Teich oder See, der früher nicht da war. Man hat den Boden künstlich überschwemmt. Das Rauschen des Wasser und die Beherrschung des aus den Schienen gesprungenen Fahrzeugs erzeugt in mir ein Gefühl des Glücks oder einer aufkommenden Leidenschaft, als ob plötzlich eine Welle unter einem aufgeht oder die Pferde mit einem Wagen zügig anrucken. Es geht einen steilen Berg hinauf, den ich mit meinem Wagen in Kehren und Serpentinen bewältigen muss, damit er nicht stehen bleibt -- doch geht es immer wieder über den Punkt, wo Zugkraft und Schwerkraft in der Schwebe bleiben, hinweg, und schliesslich erklimmt das Fahrzeug unter mir, auf dem ich gleichsam reite, den Gipfel, wo der Weg in eine hohe Ebene überleitet. Es liegt Schnee, und nackte Kinder und Mädchen spielen hier, deren Leiber mit einzelnen Schneekristallen bedeckt sind. Die Leidenschaft scheint sie warm zu halten und sie haben strahlende Gesichter.

Das Laufen gelang mir federleicht, und die Füsse waren ganz warm. Ich hatte dort mit etwa ellenlangen Fischen zu tun, die Köpfe hatten wie Pottwale. Sie drängten sich aus den Bassins und waren in manchem wie Hunde. Während des Laufs begegnete mir Margund im Turnzeug, die von einer Sportstunde zurückkam. Dann kämpfte ich plötzlich wieder um Gisela. Alles war wieder entfacht. Ich sah sie auf einem Plakat mit fast enthülltem Busen. Die Brustwarzen waren tief rot. Das Gesicht ein wenig maskenhaft dargestellt. Sie war mehr Frau geworden und doch völlig unverändert. Man sah das auch auf dem Plakat. Dann hatte sie irgend eine öffentliche Aufgabe, und zwar handelte es sich um die Behandlung der heimgekehrten Gefangenen. Sie musste entscheiden, welche und wieviele bevorzugt behandelt werden sollten. Als diese Arbeit abgeschlossen war, drückte ihr sogar Bismarck -- und zwar der aus den Lenbach.Bild -- das bei uns zu Hause hing, die Hand. Den eigentlichen persönlichen Teil des Traums habe ich vergessen. Ich weiss nur, dass er sehr leidenschaftlich war und mich noch im Halbwachen sehr beschäftigte. Auf dem Plakat mit den enthüllten Brüsten stand geschrieben, dass ihr Mann nicht zu ihr passe. (206 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1625 (1955-10-16 - Freiburg)Ein Mädchen, das ich beim Baden im Schweriner See kennengelernt habe. Wir haben dort nackt gebadet. Auf dem Rückweg in die Stadt zieht ein Gewitter auf. Blitz und Donner kommen sich immer näher und haben sich, als wir über den "Tugendpfad" gehen (Abkürzungsweg in den Uferwiesen), fast berührt. Da müssen wir über eine grosse eiserne Brücke, die plötzlich (statt der früheren hölzernen und kleinen) über den Bach führt. Ein Amerikaner kommt uns mit seinen Angehörigen entgegen. Er geht sorgfältig auf den Eisenrändern, denn er vertritt die These, dass der Blitz ins Eisen schwerer einschlägt als ins nasse Holz. Andere wieder behaupten das Gegenteil. -- Wir nehmen uns einfach am Arm und springen schnell und ohne Rücksicht auf die Theorien über die Brücke hinweg. -- Sie wohnt auf dem Alten Garten am Ufer hinter der Siegessäule (wo in Wirklichkeit keine Häuser stehen). Ihr Vater hatte dort schon lange ein Photographen-Geschäft, das sie geerbt hat. Als wir ankommen, ist dort ein alter Liebhaber, der mit dem Messer auf uns losgehen will. Es gelingt mir aber, ihn zu beruhigen. Unsere Freundschaft war zunächst nur flüchtig und im Wasser geschlossen, als wir beide nackt waren. Doch weiss ich, dass ich in das Haus hineingehen werde, und das jetzt ich dort hingehöre. Draussen werden Gegenstände angeboten, die das Mädchen nicht mehr haben will. Zwei Mädchen aus dem Laden sind schnell herausgesprungen, um sie anzusehen. Die eine findet ein blaues Nachthemd darunter, das sie an ihren Körper hält. Es ist durchsichtig, und ihre Brustwarzen und die Schamhaare sind darunter zu sehen -- , obwohl sie vorher Kleider anhatte. Dieser Gegensatz fällt mir im Traum nicht auf. Sie nimmt den blauen Stoff an den Beinen zusammen, so dass er sich ganz ihrem Körper anschmiegt. Die Schamhaare und das Rot der Brustwarzen bekommen durch den blauen Schleier eine ganz eigenartige pompejanische Färbung, die wunderbar zu dem Blau harmoniert. Dies alles spielt sich in wenigen Sekunden, gleichsam in einer Handbewegung ab. Es ist wie ein Vexierbild. Das Mädchen erzählt der anderen, dass man unten -- sie zeigt in die Höhe der Oberschenkel -- eine Naht in das Hemd machen müsse, damit es ganz eng sitze. Ihre Mutter habe das auch so. (362 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1628 (1955-10-21 - Freiburg)Ich schlendere durch eine Altstadt. In einem Geschäft Namens Müller sehe ich Herrn Müller arbeiten. Ich wusste nicht, dass er hier tätig war. Wir unterhielten uns eine Weile. Auf dem Rückweg sah ich durch einen grossen offenen Toreingang in das Reservoir eines Verlags. Überall standen Bücher an den Wänden. Ich ging wie im Traum hinein, um die Bücher zu sehen. Plötzlich ein Knall. Ein Kanonenschlag war losgegangen, der zur Warnung gegen Diebe ausgelegt war. Ich liess vor Schreck das Brot fallen, das mir Frau Böhringer mitgegeben hatte, und stürzte hinaus. Eine freundliche Verlagsangestellte, eine ältere Frau schon, erklärte mir, welcher Verlag dies sei, und beruhigte mich. Im Weiterschlendern kam ich über kleine Treppchen zwischen schmalen Bächen und Kanälen und alten Häusern. Es war eine sehr reizvolle Altstadt, die ich noch gar nicht kannte. Dann war ich im Institut. Frau Böhringer erklärte mir, dass ich als "Schreibkraft" nun dort angestellt würde, und nannte die Reihenfolge der anderen Namen, unter denen auch Michel war -- während sie mit Bender am Telephon sprach. Dann berichtigte sie sich. Michel kommt vor Uslar, weil er im Rang höher ist. Ich sagte: "Das ist zwar Unsinn, denn ich bin schon viel länger Doktor, aber wenn es in der Bezahlung nichts ausmacht, ist es mir egal." Dann sprach ich mit Derwort, der gerade da war, und begleitete ihn auf die Strasse -- das Institut lag mitten in der Altstadt. Er ging in Richtung auf jenen Verlag, an dem ich jetzt angestellt war. Ich hatte ganz leichte elegante Pantöffelchen an, aus dunkelrosa Leder. Eigentlich wollte ich mich für den Weg ins Geschäft umziehen, aber da Derwort gerade den selben Weg ging, beschloss ich, in den etwas aussergewöhnlichen Schuhen weiter zu gehen. Derwort sagte: "Es ist ganz gut, dass sie jetzt so viele Tests machen müssen. Da lernen Sie das auch und werden etwas quickly." Erwachen. (307 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1631 (1955-11-05 - Freiburg)Traum nach einer -- auch für Billchen und Emme -- im Schlaf sehr unruhige Nacht: Ich fand gegen Morgen lauter Staniolstreifen, wie sie Flugzeuge zum Schutz gegen Radaranpeilungen abwerfen. Mein erster Gedanke: Ist wieder Krieg? Oder handelt es sich um eine kriegsähnliche militärische Übung? Deswegen also haben wir alle so unruhig geschlafen. Ich sammelte die Silberstreifen auf, fand aber, dass einige merkwürdig stabil und metallisch scharfkantig waren, so dass Billchen sich daran hätte schneiden können. Am Morgen sagte Bender, der im selben Hause wohnte, dass in der Nacht ein Flugzeug abgestürzt sei. Es handle sich um die Splitter des zerborstenen Flugzeugs, die ins Haus geflogen seien, und nicht bloss um Staniolstreifen. Ich erwiderte, dass aber einige der Streifen ganz weich und silberpapierartig gewesen seien, wie die Streifen, die man gegen Radar abwirft. Er meinte, das Flugzeug könne diese bei sich gehabt haben. Andere Szene: Ich ging mit Feeli abends aus dem Haus, ganz eng umschlungen, und froh, allen Arbeitstrubel hinter mir zu haben. Es war eine kleine alte Hafenstadt, und wir pressten uns im Gehen ganz fest aneinander. Plötzlich merkte ich, dass sie einen Bademantel anhatte und offensichtlich zum Baden gehen wollte. Andere Szene: Ich fuhr mit Emme und Billchen jenseits eines Sees, wie in Wittmoldt, in einem Autobus. Ich sass ganz vorne neben dem Fahrer. Plötzlich sahen wir die Strasse bedeckt mit Trümmern von dem abgestürzten Flugzeug, die zum Teil auch in den Bäumen hingen, und den Boden mit kleinen Splittern bestreut. Benders Vermutung war also richtig gewesen. Der Fahrer steuerte geschickt um sie herum. Dann kam uns aber ein Ochsenfuhrwerk entgegen. Der Ochse wandte sich unmotiviert plötzlich nach links und versperrte den Weg. So mussten wir sehr plötzlich nach links ausbiegen. Das Fahrzeug geriet ins Schleudern, der Fahrer konnte es aber wieder fangen. Andere Szene: wieder im Hause. Ich stand vor einem Bild, das viele gepanzerte Ritter zeigte. Dazu wurde mir gesagt. Dies sind die Ritter, die vorhin explodiert sind". Ich war sehr beeindruckt von dem Bild. Die Ritter figurierten jetzt im Traum einfach, und ohne, dass es mir auffiel, anstelle des Flugzeugs. Szilasi sagte mir, dass er meine Doktorarbeit, und zwar in der alten Fassung , noch einmal durchgesehen und Korrekturen angebracht habe, die er mit mir durchsprechen wolle. Ich sagte ihm, dass ein grosser Teil dieser Fassung in die zweite gar nicht übernommen sei. Er bestand aber auf der Durchsprache. Da plötzlich ging mir auf, dass er dies alles mit Heidegger durchgesprochen hatte, und es ihm nur darum wichtig war. (414 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1635 (1955-11-11 - Freiburg)Ein junges Mädchen. Eine Mischung aus Marion und Marina Vlady mit dem einverständnisvollen Lächeln und dieser Mischung von beseligender Freude und Selbstverständlichkeit im Gesicht. Ich traf sie auf der Strasse und hob sie mit den Armen über mich, so dass ihr Gesicht über meinem schwebte. Dann Szenen, in denen ich sie wieder suchte. Sie kam aus einem Haus heraus, aus dem sie nicht durfte -- einem Art Internat. Heimlich und halb nackt, um mich zu sehen. Doch es wurde drinnen bemerkt. Eine kleine Freundin half ihr, ganz schnell durch ein vergittertes Kellerfenster zu verschwinden. Nun musste ich versuchen, ohne bemerkt zu werden, einen Eingang zu dem Keller zu finden. Die Tür, aus der sie gekommen war, befand sich an der Ecke des Hauses -- abgeschrägt. Ich ging um das Haus herum und fand in der Seitenstrasse einen Eingang, der direkt in eine bauernartige Diele führte. Viele altmodische Türen mit eisernen Schlössern und Klinken. Jede hätte in den Keller führen können. Ich ergriff die nächste. Sie führte in die Küche. Die Bäuerin hörte mich, noch ohne mich zu sehen, und kam. Ich musste mich ganz schnell aus dem Haus drücken, um mir nicht die Möglichkeiten zu verderben. Ich ging ein Stück die Strasse hinab, die merkwürdig war -- alte Holzanbauten und Treppen -, und kehrte dann zurück. Diesmal gelang es mir, eine Tür zu finden, die um Winkel auf eine Treppe in den Keller führte. Sie knarrte, aber die Bäuerin merkte es nicht. -- Ich ging die ausgetretenen Stufen hinunter, wo ich das Mädchen mit dem glücklichen Einverständnis -- Marina oder Marion -- finden würde. Szenenwechsel: Wir lagen zusammen im Bett -- auf der einen Seite das Mädchen, auf der anderen Seite Emme, meine Frau, und waren zu dritt glücklich. Auch hier war jenes tiefe, beseligende Einverständnis möglich und voller Heiterkeit. (300 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1636 (1955-11-12 - Freiburg)Philosophische Diskussion bei Szilasi (wie gestern im Seminar) über einen Text -- doch war er nicht nur geschrieben, sondern zugleich anschaulich gegliedert als Tisch -- nicht ganz rund, sondern etwas exzentrisch -- vorne klar als Struktur gegliedert, hinten in ein Mosaik auslaufend. Diesen Übergang, der ein Übergang des Textes war -- etwa von Schelling oder Aristoteles -- wie gestern -- und dessen Anschaulichkeit mir nicht absonderlich vorkam, musste ich interpretieren, wobei die mosaikartige Ordnung eine Konsequenz aus der im Anfang herrschenden Struktur war. Das Verhältnis ist mir noch jetzt anschaulich einsichtig, obwohl ich es inhaltlich nicht erklären war. Das Mosaik war aus weissen und kühlen Steinen, die auch eine Tastqualität hatten, und nicht quadratisch, aber ausgewogen in den Formen -- gleichsam eine dynamische Struktur. (124 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1637 (1955-11-13 - Freiburg)Ein Mann, der zugleich als Wohltäter und Intrigant wirkte. So versuchte er, durch seine Geschenke zu bestechen. Mir zum Beispiel wollte er in der Klasse, um mich für seine Zwecke zu gewinnen, ein neues Radio schenken. Ich musste trotz meines Zorns darüber lächeln, denn ich merkte, dass er neben seiner Absicht auch Freude am Schenken hatte. (56 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1638 (1955-11-17 - Freiburg)Wohnte mit Müller in einem Zimmer zusammen. Die Wohnung war etwas spiessig-pedantisch. Selbst im Keller waren die Türen noch furniert und getäfert. Und da unten standen sechs Klaviere nebeneinander. In pseudobarockem Stil und furniert, aber die Tasten waren aus Porzellan statt aus Elfenbein. Zu unserem Zimmer gehörte auch noch ein Wohnzimmer. Die Wirtin war trotz ihrer Spiessigkeit recht frivol. So kam einmal ein fast nacktes Mädchen herein mit sehr weichen und nach dem Anfassen verlangenden Gliedern. Sie hatte einen ganz locker sitzenden Bikini und sah aus wie eine indische Tempeltänzerin. Müller fertigte sie aber ganz kurz ab und komplimentierte sie zum Zimmer heraus. Ich dachte, solche Damen kommen nie zu mir, zu Müller kommen sie -- und ich war etwas eifersüchtig. In dem Zimmer wohnte ausser uns beiden noch ein Bildhauer. Er machte anti-moderne Plastiken und war ein Schüler von Gerstel. (141 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1641 (1955-12-01 - Freiburg)Croiset behandelte in Benders Institut Patienten, wie gestern Trampler. Während der Arbeit im Institut bekomme ich plötzlich einen Ausschlag auf dem Bauch -- kleine Piekse, und lasse mich sofort von Croiset behandeln, zuerst direkt, später durch die Wand vom Nachbarzimmer aus, wo ich an der Wand auf einer Couch hocke. Ich höre Croisets Striche an der Wand durch das Knistern, das sie auf der Tapete verursachen. Dann kommt er ein Stück weiter und sagt plötzlich: "Hier ist es anders, weil hier eine Dame sitzt." Das stimmt, denn ein Mädchen sitzt neben mir auf der Couch. Ich bin von diesem telepathischen Ergebnis beeindruckt. (102 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1642 (1955-12-01 - Freiburg)Ich gehe durch Freiburg wie durch eine fremde Stadt und entdecke viele alte Kostbarkeiten, die ich nicht gesehen hatte früher, alte merkwürdig verzierte Kirchen und Häuser. Schliesslich trete ich durch das offene Türloch in eine Kirchenruine ein -- merke aber sogleich, dass ich einen gefährlichen Schritt gemacht habe, denn merkwürdige Elemente kommen hinter mir her und beginnen mich zu verfolgen. Ich springe auf der anderen Seite wieder aus der Ruine heraus. Dort ist Wasser -- wohl der Rand eines Sees. Dann stellt uns die Polizei. Bei den Verbrechern ist ein junges Mädchen, mit dem ich mich merkwürdig identifiziere. Sie spricht wie eine Jüdin. Sie entwischt der Polizei als erste. Doch gelingt es, sie in einem Schrank am Ufer wieder zu finden. Sie schlüpft aus einem Seitenloch, und obwohl ich ihr den Ausweg versperren könnte, und eigentlich auf de Seite der Polizei stehen sollte, lasse ich sie doch durch, und sie entkommt durch das Wasser.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1643 (1955-12-05 - Freiburg)Ein Bulle vertritt mir den Weg. Es ist an der Riviera. Meine Mutter ist am Ufer. Sie scheint der Bulle nicht zu behindern. Ich dagegen muss Umwege machen über Wege und Wiesen und Koppelzäune. Andere Szene: Müller biegt mit dem Auto versehentlich zu früh ein. Anstatt in eine Seitenstrasse gerät er in die Gasse eines Stalls, wo ihm der Bulle entgegentritt und die Windschutzscheibe seines Wagens mit dem Vorderfüssen zertrümmert. Andere Szene: Im Elternhaus. Ich habe ein altes Klavier entdeckt, das besser ist als das jetzige. Dann finde ich auch ein altes Radio -- altmodisch zwar, aber mit einem besseren Klang als das jetzige. So stehen zwei Radios und zwei Klaviere nebeneinander. Also: zwei Bullen, zwei Radios, zwei Klaviere. (119 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1644 (1955-12-10 - Freiburg)In Herdern, doch so, dass da, wo die Endhaltestelle ist, die Strassenbahn -- wie in Schwerin -- noch aus einem Wald herabkommt -- rast nachts -- schon gegen Morgen -- eine Strassenbahn herab und rangiert auf das falsche, nämlich linke Geleis. Der Schaffner, der nicht mitgekommen ist, sieht den mit Notwendigkeit kommenden Unfall voraus, denn die Gegenbahn kommt auf demselben Geleis. Er rennt in ohnmächtiger Angst und Sorge hinterher. Auch Emme sitzt in der Bahn. Ich laufe durch die Strasse und suche nach irgend einer Möglichkeit, zu telephonieren, um die Polizei anzurufen. Da sehe ich einen Automaten. Doch nein, es ist kein Telefonautomat. Erst ganz in der Nähe kann ich in der Dämmerung "Filme" lesen. Doch daneben ist eine Post. Die muss ein Telephon haben. Gott sei Dank: Die Tür ist offen. Ich stürze hinein und sehe eine Telephonzelle. Erwachen mit dem Gedanken, ich müsse die Polizei anrufen, sie solle ein Unfallkommando entgegenschicken. Aber vielleicht ist der Fahrer wahnsinnig und in seiner rasenden Fahrt nicht aufzuhalten. Also muss der Strom abgestellt werden, damit der Wagen von selbst nicht weiterfahren kann. Aber wird die Polizei darauf eingehen? Wird sie das Elektrizitätswerk dazu veranlassen? Bei diesen Überlegungen wache ich allmählich immer mehr auf. Draussen ist starker Föhnsturm. (205 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1645 (1955-12-12 - Freiburg)Ein Baby mit leuchtend blauen Augen, mit dem Billchen, die dagegen schon ein richtiges Mädchen war, angelaufen kam. Dann war die Mutter des Babys da, die die selben wasserblauen Augen und ein sehr feingeschnittenes Profil hatte. Wir liegen nebeneinander, und ich legte im vertraulichen Gespräch meine Beine über die ihren. Dann kam ihr Mann, der vor Eifersucht schwieg. Ich konnte meine Beine nur ganz langsam von den ihren heben, als wenn Blei an ihnen hinge. Das Bild der blauen Augen des Babys und der Mutter, die irgendwie identisch waren, wirkte noch lange in mir nach. (95 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1646 (1955-12-13 - Freiburg)Aus den Münster in Breisach war alles störende Beiwerk, wie Chorschranken und Gitter, entfernt, so dass der Altar des Meister H.L. in seiner bizarren heiteren Art ganz in den Raum wirken konnte. Wir standen unmittelbar davor, eine Menge von Kindern, die in einer merkwürdigen kultischen Handlung davor zu tanzen begannen. Ich tanzte mit. Dann war Karenina da, Simonis Braut, mit der ich in ganz tragenden schwebenden Walzerschritten vor dem Altar tanzte. Andere Szene: Emme wohnte in einem Zimmer, aus dessen Fenster man auf ein kleines einstöckiges Haus sah mit flachem Dach, das wie eine Renaissance-Truhe aussah. Ich hörte Pastor Werners Stimme. Er wohnte trotz seiner expansiven Art in diesem kleinen Haus, nachdem er das Kirchenregiment abgeben musste. Es war in der alten Schelf-Stadt von Schwerin. Andere Szene: Wir hatten einen mächtigen alten Schrank mit unendlich vielen Schnitzereien, eine Art Eckbuffet, das so geräumig war, dass man sich ganz und gar hineinbeugen konnte. Dann sah man oben unter dem Dach hinter Glas die merkwürdigsten Krüge und Gefässe, alles was bombastisch war: Emme hatte sie dort unzugänglich und in dem entlegensten Winkel imposant wirkend aufgebaut. Man sah sie in der äussersten Spitze des Schrankes innen über sich schwebend. Andere Szene: Wir hatten einen Alkoven im Zimmer, der einer kleinen romanischen Rundkirche glich. Er war alt und echt. Ich lag auf dem Bett, das zu kurz war und den Kopf nach hinten sinken liess, und sah in die Gewölbe und das nur teilweise Rankenwerk. (241 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1647 (1956-01-05 - Freiburg)Zuerst Besuch von Ferber, der voller Einverständnis und Freundschaft war. Dann wurde Ferber zu meinem Bruder. Wir lagen nebeneinander auf dem Bett voll brüderlicher Freundschaft und in einem Mass an Einverständnis, dass das wirkliche übersteigt. Dann war Frau Roguszka zusammen mit einem Neffen über das Treppengeländer gestiegen und versuchte, auf der Brüstung zu balancieren. Ich wunderte mich über die Sicherheit, mit der sie das tat. Dann hörte ich einen leisen Hilferuf: Frau Roguszka stand fast bewegungslos auf der Brüstung und hatte offenbar nicht mehr die Kraft, sich festzuhalten. Als ich mich zu ihr wandte, sank sie in sich zusammen und stürzte hinab. Ich rief sie ganz laut an, um sie wach zu rütteln. Sie konnte sich gerade noch mit einem Arm festhalten. Ich rief sie nun immer wieder an, damit sie nicht aufgeben sollte, bis sie mir den Arm entgegenstrecken konnte. Ich zog sie hinauf und setzte sie nun sanft hinter mir auf den Boden. Da entdeckte ich, dass draussen auf der Brüstung über dem Abgrund noch friedlich der Neffe lag und schlief, in einen Bademantel gehüllt. Ich rief ihn vorsichtig an und gleichzeitig Emme um Hilfe. Er wachte auf, streckte mir seine Hand aus und ich konnte ihn leicht hinüberziehen. Dann kam aber Emme von aussen ganz munter auf der Brüstung angekrochen. Sie war ganz wach und kletterte von selbst zurück. Andere Szene: Wir waren in einem merkwürdigen Gebäude: Oben alte gotische Kirchengewölbe mit Sternen, unten führte mitten durch das Haus eine Eisenbahn durch, gleichsam auf dem Bahnsteig wohnten wir. Dort hatte Emme Besuch von einem alten Freund, wie sie sagte. Er hatte schwarze dunkle Haare, breite wulstige Lippen und ein etwas eigenwilliges versponnenes Temperament. Als er fort war, sagte ich zu ihr: "Du hast Dir also auch schon früher immer Männer mit rätromanischen oder ähnlichen Zügen gesucht" (wie sie auch ihr Vater und ihre Geschwister hatten). Da gestand sie mir, dass es nicht irgend ein Freund, sondern ihr früherer Verlobter Heinz Emnid gewesen sei. (326 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1648 (1956-01-06 - Freiburg)Bad mit Emme in einem Badehaus. Nach einer Zeit ging sie aus irgend einem Grund in eine andere Zelle, kam aber lange nicht zurück. Inzwischen kam ein sehr gebildeter älterer Mann, der sich mit mir unterhielt. Er erzählte, dass er nicht Akademiker, sondern Kaufmann sei, und hatte die Bescheidenheit eines im Grunde gebildeten Nicht-Akademikers. Später erschien jemand anders, der die Badezelle mit Beschlag belegen wollte und sehr rücksichtslos in Emmes Wanne neues Wasser einliess. Ich wies ihn hinweg. Der andere Herr verabschiedete sich. Später kam Emme in Begleitung einer mittelalten, etwas eigenwilligen Dame, in deren Zelle sie inzwischen ein zweites Mal gebadet hatte. Sie war ganz betäubt von den Fichtelnadelessenzen und in einem traumartigen Zustand. Die Frau führte sie herein und begrüsste mich, dabei feststellend: "Er riecht nach Kastanienbaum." Ich erwiderte: "Nicht nach Apfelbaum? -- Danach müsste ich viel eher riechen, da ich Apple Blossom genommen habe". Die Dame schien etwas betont in Gerüchen zu leben. (156 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1649 (1956-01-06 - Freiburg)Ich hatte unter einer Auswahl von sehr alten Stühlen einen Renaissance-Stuhl gekauft. Er befriedigte mich nicht ganz, aber kam meinem Ideal am nächsten. Er hatte gerade, gedrehte Beine, sehr gerade Flächen und etwas breite Formen. Er hatte die archaische Strenge alter Renaissance-Formen. Etwa so (hier eine Zeichnung des Stuhls im handschriftlichen Manuskript). Ich brachte ihn Emme in die Badezelle. Sie erklärte mir, dass sie unter derselben Auswahl gestern schon einen noch schöneren Barockstuhl gefunden habe. Das war gerade das, was ich suchte. Wir beschlossen darum, diesen Renaissance-Stuhl zurückzubringen. Nun merkte ich aber, wie sehr ich ihn in seiner kindlichen Strenge und Unbeholfenheit schon in mein Herz geschlossen hatte, und mochte mich nicht von ihm trennen. Es gab dann auch noch irgendwie ein kleineres und silbernes oder goldenes Modell von ihm -- etwa in der Grösse meiner Zeichnung. Dieses war wie der Kristallisationskern meines Ideals des Stuhls.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1650 (1956-01-09 - Freiburg)Eine Frau in einem sehr rasanten Auto. Ich steige zu ihr ein und fahre sie durch die Strassen einer unbekannten Stadt, dabei alle Fahrzeuge in schnellen und gewagten Kurven überholend -- dann -- noch im letzten Moment an einem schweren Lastauto vorbei -- und das ist nur möglich, weil ihr Wagen sehr schnell reagiert und anspringt, - rechts hinein in eine steile Bergstrasse. Sie läuft in eine treppenartige übersteile Promenade aus, die man mit dem Auto nicht fahren kann. Vielleicht geht es ein wenig weiter links. Ich kehre kurzerhand um. Auch links verlieren sich die Strassen in steilen Treppen, doch ein schmaler Gang führt auf einem Holzsteg über dem Wasser geschützt zwischen Häuserwänden. Ich fahre kurzerhand hinein, obwohl es dort kein Zurück gibt. Wir fahren immer näher an das Wasser heran, immer langsamer und legen uns zurück und geniessen. (139 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1652 (1956-01-11 - Freiburg)Heiss und Frl. Hiltmann waren die ganze Nacht schweigend in unserem Zimmer. Heiss sass auf meiner Couch, wo ich immer sitze, Hiltmann auf dem Drehstuhl, wo Emme immer sitzt. Beide sagten kein Wort, sondern waren nur in einer merkwürdig stillen und dezenten Art dauernd gegenwärtig. Emme und ich gingen währenddessen unseren täglichen Beschäftigungen nach. Emme legte, glaube ich, Windeln zusammen, und ich sass beim Ofen. Spät in der Nacht ging Emme hinaus und kam sehr lange nicht wieder. Heiss und Hiltmann blieben deshalb schweigend die ganze Nacht da, weil ich um Emme Sorge hatte. Endlich gegen Morgen klingelte es viermal sehr unruhig und unsicher. Ich merkte an der Art des Klingelns sofort, dass es Emme sein musste, die in einem irgendwie gestörten Zustand sein musste. Ich lief die Treppe hinunter und fand sie vor der Tür in einem halbschlafartigen Zustand und mit Blut im Gesicht. Sie musste mit einem Auto aneinander geraten sein. Bei dem Bemühen, sie die Treppe hinaufzubringen wachte ich auf. (163 words)

Immer, wenn der Hund etwas Luft bekam, versuchte er, mich zu beissen. Schliesslich fand ich den Ausgang aus dem Gewölbe unter einem grossstädtischen Bahnhofsgebäude, in dem wir mitten im Gewirr der Räume und Gänge ein Zimmer hatten. Ich konnte das Zimmer und den Gang, an dem es lag -- wie in früheren Träumen -- nicht finden. Ich ging zu einer Blumenfrau, die in irgend einem Raum ihren Stand hatte, um sie um Rat zu fragen. Der ganze Raum war voller Blumen. Billchen spielte eine Rolle. Erwachen bei Föhn, gedrückte Stimmung. (110 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1655 (1956-01-15 - Freiburg)Traum von vielerlei Wohnungen. Zuerst eine Wohnung im Villenviertel aus der Zeit um 1900. Etwas drückend noch. In einem grossen Raum sind Wohnraum und Küche durch eine halbhohe Möbelwand so abgeteilt, dass man miteinander in Verbindung bleibt. Nachts sehe ich plötzlich durch das Fenster direkt in das Zimmer eines Nachbarhauses, in dem eine Kerze angezündet ist wie in meinem: Dann erkenne ich plötzlich, dass ich nur das Spiegelbild meines eigenen Zimmers in dem nächtlich dunklen Fenster gesehen habe. Dann eine andere, schönere Wohnung. Die Wände sind bernsteingelb und weiss-rot getönt. Doch auch hier fühle ich mich noch nicht ganz zu Hause. Zuletzt eine Wohnung, die mir ganz behagt. Wir haben drei Räume und einen Nebenraum, der selbst ein entzückendes Zimmer ist, vielleicht für Billchen. Das Bad ist neben der Küche eingebaut -- unter dem schrägen Dach. Der Raum ist nur so gross, das ihn gerade die Wanne ausfüllt, die sehr weiss und glänzend ist. (154 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1656 (1956-01-18 - Freiburg)Als ich mit Emme in der Strassenbahn von St. Valentin nach Hause fuhr, stiegen wir nicht wie sonst an der Endstation, die mit der Haltestelle bei meinem Elternhaus in Schwerin identisch war, aus, sondern die Strassenbahn fuhr weiter durch den Wald nach Zippendorf. Das hatte sie nie mehr getan. Ich hatte Emme aber oft davon erzählt, wie mich diese Fahrt der Strassenbahn als Kind merkwürdig berührt hätte: Die Bahn, die auf die Strasse, in die Stadt gehört, mitten im Wald, sozusagen im Unberührten, auf weichem Boden zu sehen. Ich erklärte Emme dies wieder, während wir durch den Wald fuhren. In Zippendorf, das ich seit meiner Kindheit zum ersten Mal wiedersah, stiegen wir aus. Es fiel mir auf, dass alle Wege viel kleiner und schmaler waren, als ich sie aus der Kinderzeit in Erinnerung hatte, und ich machte Emme darauf aufmerksam, wieviel breiter und ausgedehnter man alles in der Kindheit erlebt, weil man noch klein ist, und einen anderen Blickwinkel hat. Dann aber kamen wir an den See. Das Panorama war gross und schön wie immer. An die Ufermauer schlugen mächtige Wellen wie die Brandung des Meeres. Emme war sehr davon angetan, dass der See solche Wellen hervorbringen konnte. Sie waren grün und tief befriedigend. Wir bemerkten dann, dass die Strassenbahn noch weiter in den Wald hinter Zippendorf fuhr. Ich war sehr stolz darauf. Ich wollte Emme noch den Steinlöwen zeigen, der vor einem der Cafés auf dem Boden lag. (239 words)

Ich lege erst Billchen über den Zaun und klettere dann wie die anderen selbst hinüber, dabei den Zaun möglichst wenig berührend, an dem auch der Baum lehnt, der für Sekunden noch balanciert. Fast verfange ich mich im Zaun, doch gelingt es mir im letzten Moment noch mit Billchen zu entfliehen. (92 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1658 (1956-02-14 - Freiburg)Beim Fasching. Ein Mädchen, das sich als Viper verkleidet hatte. Der nackte Oberkörper guckte aus einer Art Manschette hervor. Die Brustwarzen hatte sie mit rotem Lack überzogen. Mit den nackten Beinen machte sie züngelnde Bewegungen wie eine Schlange, und an den nackten Füssen hatte sie lange schwarze Stacheln. Ich sass noch auf Emmes Schoss, als das Mädchen kam und stumm wie eine Schlange mit mir spielte. Sie hatte sehr klare und schöne Gesichtszüge, ein kindlich gesammeltes Wesen bei aller geballten Geschlechtlichkeit. Ich hielt sie für eine Bildhauerin, was sich dann bestätigte. (91 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1659 (1956-02-14 - Freiburg)Aus den letzten Wochen erinnere ich ähnliche Träume. Einmal war es Gisela. Ich sah zuerst, dass ihre Beine nackt waren. Sie standen wie ein Vexierbild da -- aus dem nackten Fuss hervorwachsend -- grosse weisse Flächen. Dann sah ich, dass sie ganz nackt war. Ihr Gesicht war ganz Leidenschaft und eine archaische Heiterkeit. Sie bot ihre Scham einem Manne dar, der nackt und mit ausgerecktem Glied dastand, und es in sie hineinbohrte. Es war dabei, als ob sie auf dem Glied ritt, und ich konnte jede Bewegung in dem Muskelspiel ihrer Scham sehen, während ihre Augen offen auf mich gerichtet waren und eine Welle von triebhafter heiterer Leidenschaft ergossen. Sie war nur noch Leib in einer einzigen Einheit. (118 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1664 (1956-03-03 - Freiburg)Der Traum von heute Nacht: Die Strassenbahn, in der ich sass, setzte sich in Bewegung. Erst daran, dass einige Männer nach vorne in den Führerstand stürzten, merkte ich, dass sie ohne Fahrer war, denn dieser lief nebenher und konnte die Bahn, die sich von selbst in Bewegung gesetzt hatte, nicht mehr erreichen. Es kam nun alles darauf an, den Wagen zu bremsen, ehe es zu einem Zusammenstoss kam. Einer der Männer versuchte, die Bremskurbel festzudrehen. Doch kam er zu keinem Erfolg, weil er den Motor nicht abgestellt hatte. Ich riss die Motorkurbel so schnell wie möglich auf Null zurück, wobei sie den charakteristischen Kreis beschrieb, der für die Bewegung der Strassenbahnfahrer typisch ist. Zugleich mit den ratternden Geräusch, das die Kurbel auslöst, spürte ich, wie der Wagen kräftig bremste und schliesslich, ehe es zu Komplikationen kam, ganz stand. Das Gefühl der aufgehaltenen Schwerkraft in dem plötzlich bremsenden Wagen und das bekannte surrende Geräusch der Kurbel verschmolzen dabei zu einer befriedigenden Einheit. (161 words)

Da entschliesse ich mich zum Letzten: Wir gehen beide in grösster Ruhe ihm entgehen die Treppe herunter und an ihm vorbei. Er erkennt uns nicht.

Zusammen mit anderen Psychologen. Wir schauten in die Landschaft, vor allem auf einen Wasserfall, dessen kristallklare Linien uns erfreuten. Es war die Landschaft hinter meinem Elternhaus, in der jetzt dieser Wasserfall war. Plötzlich begann der Schnee auf dem leicht schrägen Dachsims unter uns abzurutschen und wir fielen beide einige Stockwerke tief in die Tiefe. Im Fall rief ich Inge , die neben mir hinabschwebte, zu, sie müsse ganz gelockert unten aufsetzen, um sich möglichst nichts zu brechen. Immer noch den möglichen Tod vor Augen, versuchte ich für mich das Selbe. Wir landeten beide völlig heil und unversehrt im tiefen weichen Schnee. Ich war so begeistert über diesen glücklichen Ausgang, dass ich ihr um den Hals fiel und sie küsste. Dann kam ein Protokollbeamter und wollte ihre Adresse notieren, weil sie vom Dach gefallen war, dazu die meiner Frau, weil ich ihr um den Hals gefallen war. Ich war empört darüber und wollte die Aussage verweigern. (176 words)

So war also Heidegger gerade in dem Augenblick gestorben, als er meine Arbeit lesen wollte. Frau Heidegger gab mir eine alte Hose, in der ich ihn in der Tat oft gesehen hatte, und meinte, ich könne vielleicht meinem Sohn einen Konfirmandenanzug daraus machen. Diese tragik-komische Situation bedrückte mich sehr. Ausserdem bekam ich ein Manuskript von Heidegger mit vielen Zeichen und Zahlen, die ich schlecht entziffern konnte. (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1674 (1956-04-10 - Freiburg)Wir wohnten in einem sehr alten Haus mit winkligen Treppen, die in immer anderen Richtungen gingen, so wie man es zuweilen in alten gotischen Stadthäusern findet. So war es mir schwer, unsere Wohnung zu finden. Ich musste unter alten, sehr niedrigen Türen hindurchsteigen, und eine Treppenstufe war so wackelig, dass sie fast unter meinem Tritt hinabfiel. Sie lag gleichsam wie ein Bauklotz lose da. Schliesslich kam ich auf einen Flur, der zu unserer Wohnung zu führen schien. Hinten am Fenster erkannte ich undeutlich Emme und Bambi, die sich kostümierten. Aus Schildern an den Türen, die Hf. für den Fall des Weggehens schon gemalt hatte, entnahm ich, dass sie in den Zirkus Krone gehen wollten. Sie waren dabei, sich verwegen zu kostümieren, hatten Tücher um den Oberkörper geschlungen und Emme hatte eine Bikinihose an, während Bambi unten noch nackt war, und mit dem Rücken zu mir stand. Die Türen waren mit einem Bindfaden zugebunden, während Hf. und seine Freundin noch drinnen in der Wohnung waren. (164 words)

Im Hintergrund stand drohend über die ganze Strassen hinweg eine grosse Viehherde. Man konnte die Tiere im Dunklen nicht erkennen, aber es schienen Raubtiere darunter zu sein. Sie hatten den Unfall verursacht. Ich guckte an den Häuserwänden empor, ob dort die Leichen der Toten hingen. Ich sah merkwürdige Gesichter herabstarren. Doch waren es maskenhafte Vögel. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1678 (1956-04-12 - Freiburg)Ich fuhr im Autobus durch Holland und stieg schliesslich in einer der Städte aus. Eine Frau im hellen Kamelhaarmantel und mit blonden Haaren lud mich ein, die mit uns gefahren war. Sie hiess Bambi. Doch machte sie eine Bedingung: Ich hatte auf der Reise aus Bequemlichkeit mein Hemd ausgezogen und trug nur ein kleines Turnhemd. So musste ich bleiben, damit sie meine Haut berühren konnte. Es war eine sehr rauschhafte und erotische Atmosphäre. Sie hatte bei sich einen blinden Mann, dem ich Schilder auf der Strasse erklären musste, obwohl ich kein Holländisch konnte. Ich wusste nicht, wie ich bei ihr bleiben sollte in der Nacht und gleichzeitig bei Emme, die auch in der selben Stadt wohnte. Auch eine dritte Frau, spielte herein, eine junge Nachbarin, die mich zum Essen einlud. (130 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1679 (1956-05-07 - Freiburg)Emme erzählte ganz ungeniert von ihren Liebhabern, mit denen sie alle ins Bett ginge: Hf. und Hermhaus -- auch Bambi war darunter. Ich fragte verwundert: "Auch Bambi -- also ein Mädchen?" Emme fand dies ganz natürlich und auch mir imponierte es. (41 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1681 (1956-05-16 - Freiburg)Fuhr mit einem Zug -- direkt hinter der Lokomotive -- durch einen Tunnel. An einer Kurve gab es einen Unfall, der mich sehr erschreckte. Das nächste Mal fuhr der Zug über diese Strecke ganz langsam. Doch als er kurz danach am Ausgang des Tunnels in der kleinen Bergstation einfuhr, lag dort auf den Schienen eine riesengrosse Schlange, die sich zischend erhob, als die Lokomotive Dampf aussstiess. Eh wir noch aussteigen konnten, attackierte sie den Lokomotivführer und uns alle so sehr, dass er den Zug in schnellster Geschwindigkeit zurücksetzten musste. So brausten wir jetzt rückwärts über die Unfallstelle und durch die Kurve, die wir eben noch vorsichtig und langsam passiert hatten, in den Tunnel zurück, bis die Schlange von uns abgelassen hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1683 (1956-05-16 - Freiburg)Ich fuhr in einem Auto, dessen Chauffeur plötzlich neben mir sitzend das Steuer losliess, obwohl die Strasse von Fussgängern wimmelte. So musste ich das Steuer ergreifen, obwohl ich gar nicht steuern konnte, wobei er aber weiter Bremse und Gas bediente, so dass ich aus seiner Geschwindigkeit und dem Platz, den mir die vielen Leute gerade noch liessen, einen Weg machen musste. (61 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1684 (1956-05-16 - Freiburg)Ich fuhr mit der Strassenbahn durch die Strassen der Schelf-Stadt von Schwerin. Zuerst im offenen Anhänger, wie sie in Schwerin im Sommer gebraucht wurden. Dann war dieser Anhänger gleichzeitig selber Triebwagen, und ich sass ganz vorne an der Brüstung, so dass meine Beine fast hinaushingen. Die Leute auf der Strasse winkten mir zu, weil ich fast schon im Freien sass. Ich wunderte mich, wie unser Fahrer einmal fast mutwillig auf ein Auto zusteuerte. Dann fiel mir erst ein, dass er ja nicht steuerte, sondern an den Verlauf der Schienen gebunden war, auf denen sich vielmehr das Auto "mutwillig" befand. Zuletzt waren statt des Motors Pferde vor die Bahn gespannt. Die Fahrt ging nun durch die Strassen, die zum Ziegelsee führen. Sie schienen mir immer schon unheimlich, weil sie wenig Verbindung zu den mir vertrauten Teilen der Stadt hatten, die unmittelbar an sie grenzten. Das Unheimliche direkt neben dem Vertrauten. Wir hielten schliesslich dort, wo die Uferstrasse des Ziegelsees wieder in eine uralt vertraute Strasse, die Werder-Strasse, mündete. Dort ging ich in ein Kino, während sich der Kutscher zur Rückfahrt anschickte. Nach dem Kino -- inzwischen war ich aufgewacht und hatte über den Traum nachgedacht, sogar andere Träume zwischendurch gehabt....Einfälle: Die offenen Sommeranhänger haben mich als Kind sehr beeindruckt. Durch jene von mir selten begangenen Strassen fuhr früher ein Autobus, der für die schmalen Strassen viel zu breit war. Er konnte nicht kehren, sondern fuhr einen anderen Weg durch die Werderstrasse, in der Emmis Mutter wohnte, zurück. In diesem Stadtviertel war die Grundschule, die ich besuchte. Ich hatte damals manchmal merkwürdige Fremdheitserlebnisse, die mir später beim Lesen von Descartes Meditationen wieder einfiel: Ich hatte manchmal das Gefühl, die Häuser dieser Strassen könnten vielleicht alle nur Kulissen sein, hinter denen sich keine wirklichen Häuser befanden. Ich war dann froh, wenn ich die grosse alte Tür mit dem Messinggriff geöffnet hatte, die in Mudding Schultz's Haus führte und wirklich in den alten, etwa steinkühlen Hausflur eintrat, denn in diesem Moment des Öffnens der Tür hatte sich die Spannung und die Angst, ich könne hinter der Tür ins Nichts gelangen, am stärksten verdichtet. Nach dem Ende des Krieges wohnte ich mit Emmi in diesem Haus und die Gegend war damals wirklich unheimlich, weil nachts Betrunkene die Strasse unsicher machten, die völlig unberechenbar waren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1685 (1956-05-16 - Freiburg)Als ich wieder einschlief, träumte ich genau an der Stelle weiter, wo der alte Traum (Nr.1684) aufgehört hatte. Ich kam aus dem Kino und suchte die Haltestelle einer Strassenbahn, die direkt durch die Werderstrasse ins Stadtinnere zurückführte. Ich wollte dort am Marienplatz umsteigen und ins Elternhaus fahren. Ich war lange nicht mehr in Schwerin gewesen und wusste nicht Bescheid -- doch wusste ich, dass die Stadt von den Russen besetzt war. Ich sah eine Strassenbahn in grosser Geschwindigkeit heranbrausen -- modern und grossstädtisch, wie ich es in Schwerin nicht gewohnt war. In der Nähe entdeckte ich eine Haltestelle, die ich noch vor Abfahrt der Bahn zu erreichen suchte. Es gelang mir nur noch, in die rasch anfahrende Bahn aufzuspringen, wobei mir der Schaffner behilflich war. Ich redete ihn unbefangen und herzlich an, wie ich es gewohnt war, merkte aber, dass die Menschen alle etwas still und betreten waren. Nur ein Mädchen fiel mir auf, das mir gegenüber stand -- mit etwas rötlichen Haaren und frischem Gesicht. Wir schauten uns eine Weile in die Augen. Sie hatte einen sehr heiteren Gesichtsausdruck. Dann sagte sie: "Wir kennen uns doch." Mir schien dies auch. Sie sagte: "Vielleicht aus Herdern oder Luthern -- in der Nähe von Lörrach." Sie schien das Wort Freiburg bewusst zu vermeiden, weil es als Stadt im Westen bekannt war. Ich sagte: "Sie meinen doch den Stadtteil von Freiburg." Alle Leute waren über diese offenen Äusserung wieder etwas betreten. Während des Gesprächs schaute ich auf die sehr schnell vorüberfliegenden Strassen der altvertrauten Stadt. Ich beachtete sie neben dem Mädchen nur halbbewusst. Überall war das Pflaster aufgerissen für irgendwelche Umbauten. Die Stadt wurde offenbar modernisiert. Erwachen. (275 words)

Es war am Eingang zur Schweriner Schlossbrücke. Doch plötzlich kamen uns Pferde entgegen, gegen die ich auf dem Fahrzeug gar nicht gesichert war. Sie reckten ihre Hälse über die Brüstung und schnappten mit dem Mäulern nach mir. Das Fahrzeug fuhr sehr schnell, doch die Pferde waren schneller. (74 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1688 (1956-06-03 - Freiburg)Zwei Träume aus der Woche vor dem 3.6.1956: In Benders Institut. Bender fragt: "Was arbeiten Sie eigentlich? Was haben Sie überhaupt getan? Und wann kommen und gehen Sie überhaupt?" Ich bin empört und antworte: "Als so viel Arbeit da war, dass ich bis spät in die Nacht daran sass, hat auch niemand danach gefragt." (54 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1689 (1956-06-03 - Freiburg)Traum vom folgenden Tag (ich glaube vom 2.6.1956): In Benders Institut. Sehr viel Betrieb dort. Ich will zu Frl. Strauch in den Keller. Doch liegen auf der Kellertreppe einige Mopeds, über die ich hinwegklettere. Als ich unten bei Frl. Strauch bin, werfen die anderen so viele Mopeds auf die Kellertreppe, dass der Ausgang vollkommen verstopft ist, und ich bei Frl. Strauch bleiben muss, was mir auch lieber ist, als oben im Institut zu sein. (74 words)

Ich bin empört, dass mein Vater so geizig ist. Wir unterhalten uns später im Geschwisterkreis zu Hause darüber und sind voller Zorn. Da erzählt eins der Geschwister, er habe ihr das neulich im Gespräch vordemonstriert an dem Ausfall von Frau Bauch. Da lachen wir alle und wissen, der alte Herr will also wieder heiraten und das ist des Pudels Kern: er will sein Auto leer haben, damit er Frau Bauch mitnehmen kann. (125 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1692 (1956-06-11 - Freiburg)Im Kreuzgang des Schweriner Doms, der im Traum so hoch ist wie das Kirchenschiff. Eine herrliche Architektur, kleeblattartige Netzgewölbe -- gotisch und zugleich barock, auf schlanken roten Backsteinpfeilern ruhend. Die Fugen werden überall an der Kirche neu ausgestrichen. Ich versuche, auch in das Kirchenschiff hereinzugucken. Doch drinnen höre ich Stimmen. Es scheint aber kein Gottesdienst zu sein. Dann sehe ich: Es ist eine Unterrichtsstunde. Eine Stimme -- die des Vortragenden, sagt: "Ist Herr von Uslar wieder da?" Offenbar ist es Pastor Heinzeler, der mich erkannt hat. Ich verlasse nun den Kreuzgang und gehe durch die offene Stadt, wo es gefährlich ist. -- Weitere Teile des Traums habe ich vergessen. (109 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1693 (1956-06-12 - Freiburg)Autobusunglück im Gebirge. Man sah die blutbespritzten Leichen im weissen Schnee. Am Tag darauf sollte ich mit einem Autobus durch die Berge reisen. Es widerstrebte mir. Als Erklärung für das vortägige Unglück hiess es, die Fahrer waren ausser Übung. Sie konnten die Wagen auf der abschüssigen Bahn nicht halten. Ich sagte mir: "Es kann heute nicht viel anders sein" und es widerstrebte mir, mitzufahren. Andererseits schien es mir schmählich, aus diesem Grund zurückzubleiben. In diesem Konflikt wachte ich auf und war sehr froh, als ich langsam begriff, dass diese Reise mir nicht wirklich bevorstand, und ich den Konflikt nicht zu entscheiden brauchte. (102 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1694 (1956-06-16 - Freiburg)Grosses Fest bei Szilasi, das die ganze Nacht dauerte. Inge war da als seine Assistentin. Wir liebten uns sehr. Szilasi war zugleich auch Arzt. So sah ich, als ich zufällig ins Zimmer kam, wie er Inge hypnotisierte. Ich verstand nur noch die Worte: "Wenn es dann wiederkommt und Sie merken, dass Sie wieder flach liegen, dann richten Sie schnell eine Wand auf -- nicht wahr?". Dann löste er die Hypnose durch eine kurze, drehende Handbewegung, zu der er nur Tütelütüt sagte. Ausserdem war er aber auch Jurist. Im Flur stand ein grosses Plakat, das alle Leute zur Teilnahme an einem morgen stattfindenden Prozess einlud. Die Wohnung war grossräumig und sehr gepflegt. Das Parkett war spiegelblank. Wenn sich beim Walzertanzen die ganze Welt nur noch wie ein Strich drehte -- so wie man sie als selbst Tanzender sieht, umarmten wir uns kräftig. Nur war es im Traum so, dass die Drehung die Welt wirklich hatte, auch wenn wir im Tanzen inne hielten. Später einmal hatte Szilasi -- schon spät in der Nacht -- einen Bambusstock zerbrochen. Ich half ihm beim Aufheben der Trümmer und fegte den Staubrest zusammen. Als ich ihn gerade hochkehren wollte, entdeckte ich ein kleines, etwa faustgrosses Loch im Fussboden, durch das man in die Zimmer der Unterwohnung gucken konnte. Dort kehrte ich -- es war wie ein Mausloch, den Dreck einfach hinein, und hörte, wie er unten hinabfiel. Ich hatte etwas Angst, die Leute könnten hinauf kommen. Da sich nichts rührte, schien alles gut zu sein. Wahrscheinlich schliefen die Leute in der Nacht. -- Der ganze Traum war sehr dicht und farbig von solchen Einzelheiten. (268 words)

Andere Szene: Gregor hatte eine Schwester mit drei statt zwei Reihen Zähnen. Das Mädchen sah hübsch aus, nur wenn sie den Mund öffnete, sah man im Oberkiefer statt einer zwei Reihen Zähne. Sie erklärte und zeigte mir das freiwillig und ganz ungeniert, als sie merkte, dass ich darauf schaute. Die Zähne waren in beiden Reihen schon plombiert. Sie sagte, dass ihr Bruder zurückgekommen sei. Es war Abends. Ich hoffte ihn vor meinem Besuch bei Binswanger morgens noch zu sehen. Ich musste aber abends noch ins Seminar zu Szilasis und versäumte, aus der Strassenbahn auszusteigen. (126 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1696 (1956-06-22 - Freiburg)Ich ging über den Flur aus unserem Zimmer und fand dort noch zwei Zimmer, die ich ganz aus den Augen verloren hatte, und die wir gar nicht mehr bewohnten: Es waren Emmes ehemalige Zimmer -- mit einer geblümten Tapete. Ich bemerkte, dass Emme den Ofen geheizt hatte, was sie offenbar immer tat. Wir bewohnten die Zimmer nicht, aber sie heizte sie. Ich fand, dass wir diese Zimmer auch bewohnen sollten. Wir hätten dann viel mehr Platz und eine günstigere Wohnung. (80 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1698 (1956-06-27 - Freiburg)Traum, von dem ich nicht mehr weiss, ob er eigentlich heute Nacht, oder schon in der letzten Nacht war: Ich hatte Besuch von einem Maler. Er beguckte meine Zeichnungen, die in der Stube hängen, ohne zu wissen, dass sie von mir waren: "Das ist nicht viel". Dann zeigte er auf das Bild der Madonna von Giotto, deren Herkunft er aber offenbar nicht kannte -- er behandelte sie gewissermassen gleichberechtigt mit den Zeichnungen -- und sagte: "Das ist gut." Ich war von dem Urteil über meine Zeichnungen etwas betroffen. (88 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1699 (1956-06-27 - Freiburg)Traum von heute früh: Ich hatte mich freiwillig zur Wehrmacht gemeldet. Ich war selbst etwas erstaunt darüber. Meine Überlegung war folgende: Wenn ich doch eingezogen werde, dann lieber vorher freiwillig melden, denn was man freiwillig tut, nicht aus blossem Zwang, tut man leichter. Wir sammelten uns in einem noch ganz privat anmutendem Raum. Auch Mädchen waren darunter. Diese gingen genauso zur Wehrmacht wie Männer. Das gab dem Ganzen einen anderen Rahmen als der früheren Wehrmacht -- sie war gleichsam erwachsener. In diesem Raum bekamen wir Nummern, mit denen wir zur Kaserne transportiert wurden. Im Autobus merkte ich, dass ich in dem mehr privaten Raum meinen Bademantel und anderes vergessen hatte. Ich dachte, da ich aus dem Autobus nicht aussteigen konnte, nun fahre ich eben später nochmal zurück. In der Kaserne gaben wir unsere Nummer bei einem Pförtnerfenster ab und wurden den Nummern nach weggeschickt. Die Möglichkeit des Zurückgehens schien nun nicht mehr gegeben. (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1702 (1956-07-08 - Freiburg)Eine Freundin von Hermhaus. Sie hatte blondes Haar und schwarze Augenbrauen. Sie war nackt und gertenschlank und schmiegte sich an mich im Gehen, so dass meine Hände über die leichten Biegungen ihres Körpers glitten und ihre zarte Haut wie ein Getränk einsogen. Sie hatte hellblaue Augen und einen Blick, in dem Leidenschaft und Klugheit nicht getrennt waren. Wir waren dann in einem Haus, in dem mehrere Flügel ebenerdig und ohne Oberstock gangartig so dicht nebeneinander gebaut waren, dass man von den Zimmern des einen in die Zimmer des andren kucken konnte. - Dann waren viele Geschwister des Mädchens da, die ihr sehr ähnlich aber nicht gleich sahen - und die doch nicht das Selbe waren. - Und die Mutter der Mädchen, die zugleich M's Mutter war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1704 (1956-07-15 - Freiburg)Ich fuhr mit Inge in der Eisenbahn. Die Abteile waren leer. Im Nachbarabteil entdeckte ich ein Fenster an der Stirnwand, aus dem man auf die Schienen schauen konnte -- also das Vorderende des Zuges ohne Lokomotive. Wir befanden uns also in einem Triebwagen. Ich sah nun, dass man durch den Mittelgang auch aus dem entsprechenden Hinterfenster gucken konnte. Der Triebwagen hatte also keine Anhänger. Später stieg sie aus, vergass aber ein Netz mit einem riesengrossen Kommissbrot und einen Koffer mit anscheinend unwesentlichen Sachen. Ich musste noch weiterfahren bis Kassel, hatte aber keine Lust, diese Sachen mitzuschleppen, und überlegte, wie ich sie loswerden konnte. Das Brot hatte sie offenbar von Bekannten bekommen. Man konnte dieses umfangreiche Ding auf Reisen gar nicht gebrauchen, auf denen man unbeschwert sein musste. So hatte sie es offenbar unbewusst einfach liegen lassen. Ich dachte, es weiterzugeben, vielleicht an die Bahnhofsmission. Der Wagen hielt schliesslich vor einem grossen Bahnhof draussen vor der Halle. Ich konnte die Buchstaben innen an der Stirnwand der gläsernen Halle nur in Spiegelschrift lesen. Es konnte Kassel heissen -- war aber nicht richtig zu entziffern. Ich war unschlüssig, ob ich aussteigen sollte. (189 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1705 (1956-07-16 - Freiburg)Inge erklärte mir mit viel Eifer die Theorien über die Zusammensetzung des Blutes. Sie hatte dazu Reagenzgläser und andere Instrumente und einen weissen Kittel an. Ich sagte: "Sie entwickeln sich noch zur Blutspezialistin" und war ganz froh, dass sie eine Linie gefunden hatte. Andere Szene: Ich fuhr mit der Bahn durch Russland, offenbar auf der Heimkehr aus irgendeiner Gefangenschaft. Ich hatte nur zwei Regenschirme und ganz wenig Gepäck bei mir. Ich wusste, dass ich irgendwo an der Küste aussteigen musste. Ich fragte irgendeinen Passanten, als wir hielten, aufs Geratewohl in deutscher Sprache: "Wie heisst diese Station?" Er antwortete in einer englisch klingenden Sprache: "Invasion-Mall". Das musst etwa heissen: "Strasse der Invasion", sagte ich mir (in Analogie zu Pall-Mall) Invasion macht man an der Küste. Dort kommt man aber auch aus dem Lande heraus. Also würde ich hier aussteigen müssen. Ich nahm meine Schirme, die mir am wichtigsten waren, und meine Sachen, suchte aber noch ein kleines Herz an einer Kette -- einen Anhänger -- das mir so wichtig war, dass ich nicht ohne es gehen wollte. Da sah ich Bille aus Wittmoldt durch die Tür kommen. Sie hatte ein ganz kurzes Kleid an, das die Beine nackt liess und hatte das kleine Silberherz zwischen ihren nackten Brüsten verborgen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1706 (1956-07-20 - Freiburg)Ein merkwürdig verschlossen und verstört aussehendes junges Mädchen erschien plötzlich in unserer Wohnung. Sie sagte, sie sei Marie Antoinette. Sie war offensichtlich schizophren. Sie war sehr schmal und sah verängstigt aus. Wahrscheinlich kam sie aus Emmendingen. Ich überlegte, wie sie meine Adresse erfahren haben könnte -- wahrscheinlich von Frau P., die auch in Emmendingen war. Nach dem Erwachen musste ich noch lange in einem halbwachen Zustand darüber nachdenken, wobei mir die Sache nicht als Traum, sondern als Tatsache erschien -- vielleicht war ich auch wieder leicht eingeschlafen. Ich überlegte, was zu tun sei -- dass ich Bille vor ihr schützen müsse und so weiter. (104 words)

Dabei blieb ich mit meinem Bademantel an der frisch gestrichenen Tür hängen. Als ich ihn losriss, war an der Tür ein schwarzer Fleck: Die Farbe war fortgewischt. Im Weitergehen entdeckte ich, dass viele Türen an dem Gang neu gemacht waren. Sie waren aus Naturholz und sehr modern. Das passte gut zu dem alten Haus. (99 words)

Ich hob mit der einen Hand das Becken des Mädchens -- was nicht schwer war, denn sie war sehr leicht -- und griff mit der anderen nach ihrer Scham. Sie strahlte mich an und sagte: "Da drinnen ist es noch leer." Ich sah sie fragend an, weil ich sie nicht verstand. Sie sagte: "Ich meine, dass man etwas hineinbringen kann." Jetzt verstand ich sie. Ich schaute mich nach Emme um, doch sie hatte sich abgewendet und ging fort. Darum zögerte ich noch -- und erwachte.

In ihrem Zimmer hatte die Frau ein manieristisches Relief, das mir sehr imponierte. Es erinnerte etwas an die Bronzetüren von Florenz, war aber aus weissem Marmor. Auch Ähnlichkeiten mit dem Breisacher Altar waren zu sehen. Doch war es südländischer in der Form. Sie hatte ein Heft dabei liegen mit Aufzeichnungen über das Relief, doch konnte den Namen des Schöpfers nicht finden. Es war alles in einer sanften, nicht sehr klaren aber vitalen Sphäre in dem Haus und um die Frau. (120 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1711 (1956-08-12 - Freiburg)Besuch von Heidegger. Wir besahen zusammen illustrierte Zeitschriften. Wir sassen dabei unmittelbar nebeneinander auf einem Sofa. Ich betrachtete Heideggers Gesicht und Figur dabei genau. Mir schien das gemeinsame Betrachten einer Illustrierten eine Art der Kommunikation, die völlig befriedigend war. Später spielte Nicolai Hartmann im Traum eine Rolle. Er war 1950 wie ich von Göttingen nach Freiburg gekommen und hier Ordinarius gewesen. Jetzt wollte er fortgehen -- ich glaube in die Schweiz. In der nächsten Szene fand ich mich sehr betrübt -- ich glaube mein Bruder - oder Ferber -- sagt: "Du bist offenbar so betrübt, weil die Universität von Dir fortgeht." Da war mir klar, dass es Hartmanns Fortgehen war, das mich betrübte. In einer letzten Szene Gespräch mit einer Assistentin Hartmanns über eine Fleissprüfung bei ihm. Ich erklärte, dass ich schon viele bei ihm gemacht habe. Sie konnte diese im Journal der letzten Semester nicht finden. Ich sagte ihr, dass liege schon länger zurück, schon in der Göttinger Zeit.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1712 (1956-08-16 - Freiburg)Ziemlich aufregende Träume in den letzten Nächten, die ich aber schwer behalten konnte -- zum Teil im Milieu der Kriminalromane von Wallace, die ich am Tage gelesen hatte. Auch heute Nacht sehr aufregender Traum, von dem ich nur noch fetzenhafte Einzelheiten weiss, die aber wie Nebelschwaden etwas schnell und dicht über dem inneren Auge vorbeizogen. Ich fuhr in einem Zug, sass aber oben auf dem Dach des Wagens und musste sehr aufpassen, dass ich nicht herunterfiel. Die Umstände der Reise sind mir entfallen. Dann in einem öffentlichen Gebäude -- der Post oder dem Bahnhof, aber mit familiärer Atmosphäre, etwa: die Töchter des Bahnhofvorstands -- jedenfalls eines Beamten. Eine von ihnen stand in einer Schalterhalle, und erzählte die Geschichte ihres Vaters, der irgendwie vom Dach von etwas -- wahrscheinlich von dem Wagen -herabgestürzt war. Die Geschichte war nicht ohne Humor und berührte mich sehr und verband mich mit dem blonden, nicht eigentlich schönen, aber reifen und freundlichen Mädchen. Die ganze Szene hatte etwas Nächtliches, Fremdes, wie wir es manchmal auf fremden Bahnhöfen und überhaupt auf Reisen empfinden. (176 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1713 (1956-08-21 - Freiburg)In einem Offizierskorps. Irgend ein Halbwissenschaftler hielt einen Vortrag über Träume, den man wohl oder übel anhören musste. Dann eine riesengrosse steinerne Badewanne, die dem Offizierskorps gehörte. Ich erinnerte mich, dass ich dort schon mit dem General und anderen Offizieren gebadet hatte. Die Atmosphäre war sehr familiär und sympathisch. Dieselbe Atmosphäre dann in der nächsten Szene im Bankhaus Krebs (einem Familienunternehmen, wo Emme und Hf. gearbeitet haben und wir jetzt unser Geld haben). Der Bankchef fragte uns, ob wir ihm für zwei Tage gegen so und so viel Prozent Zinsen für eine grössere Aktion unser Konto zur Verfügung stellen wollten. Ich sagte sofort zu. Es war nur eine Kreditfrage, und ich hatte sehr viel Kredit zu diesem Bankhaus (was ich auch in Wirklichkeit habe). In der nächsten Szene war das Bankhaus eine Art Wohnung, in der auch ein junges Mädchen -- wie Ika -- wohnte, die mir sehr vertraut war, und die ich dort besuchte. Ich traf sie in ihrer Küche, wo sie unter einem grossen Abwaschtisch hinter zwei Holztüren ihre Schüsseln verborgen hatte. Die Badewanne kam schon in einer früheren Traumszene (vor dem Offizierskorps) einmal vor. Hier war sie in einem Geschäft, sozusagen als Privat- und Musterstück -- mit einem grossen Kupferkessel und aus Metall und Email -- aber beides nicht zu verkaufen. (214 words)

Die Schlange war aus zweierlei Braun, hellerem und dunklerem, gezeichnet - nicht regelmässig - sondern wie bei Schlangenleder. Ich kannte das Muster nicht, aber wusste sofort, dass sie giftig war, und wollte das Kind zum Arzt tragen. (67 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1715 (1956-08-23 - Freiburg)Es ist Krieg. Ich bin in einer Stube. Höfling und Freudenberg (Assistenten Szilasis) gehören auch zu der Truppe. Fünfzehn Minuten nach Voll soll der Krieg wieder beginnen. Die Aussichten für diesen Krieg scheinen mir hoffnungslos. Ich will darum nicht an die Front. Ich sitze in einer Ecke des Zimmers und habe eine grosse Mütze aufgesetzt, die nur Nase, Mund und Auge freilässt, sonst aber auch das Gesicht umschliesst. Freudenberg erzählt von einem transportablen Haus, das seine Angehörigen jetzt hier aufstellen wollen. Es hätte noch besser sein können, aber die bessere Firma baut keine Häuser nördlich der Main-Linie auf, wo das betreffende Haus vorher stand. Dann kam Frl. Zimmer hereingelaufen (die Sozialfürsorgerin der Studentenhilfe) und fragte mich: "Können Sie 'niegriechisch', ich brauche jemand der 'niegriechisch' kann". Ich antworte: "Ich kann kein Neugriechisch". -- Frl. Zimmer: "Das sagte schon Szilasi: wer altgriechisch kann, kann meist kein neugriechisch." (145 words)

Ich weiss, dass ein Bombenangriff war und frage sie: "Ist irgend etwas passiert? Du bist verwundet." Sie antwortet nicht, guckt mich nur stumm an -- wobei sie zugleich Gisela ist. Ihre Beine müssen furchtbar zugerichtet sein.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1717 (1956-08-25 - Freiburg)Hf., der einen Urlaub von vierzehn Tagen in Lerici -- südlich von Genua am Meer verbringt --, war plötzlich vor Heimweh zurückgekommen. Seine Koffer hatte er dort gelassen. Er war nur für einen Tag hierher zurückgefahren, um sein Heimweh zu befriedigen. Ich fand das sehr merkwürdig und war sehr beeindruckt, denn es war immerhin eine lange Reise. Aber ich konnte es ihm sehr nachfühlen. Es musste sich in Lerici manches verändert haben. Er war früher schon einmal dort und er hatte viel davon geschwärmt, besonders von einer etwas vagabundenhaften Herbergsmutter, namens Madi, die alle Leute in Turisti und Vagabondi einteilte. Er war stolz, zu letzteren zu gehören. Ich fragte ihn, ob sie nicht mehr da sei. Doch -- aber er konnte nicht bei ihr wohnen. Er sagte, die Entfernung nach Lerici betrüge nur 75 Kilometer. Ich war erstaunt und sagte: "Bis Basel sind es doch schon sechzig, dann sind ja von dort bis Lerici bloss fünfzehn". Er: "Ja, das stimmt auch. Da kommen nur noch die Pässe." (167 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1718 (1956-08-25 - Freiburg)Ich wohne zur Miete in einer Wohnung, in der auch eine junge Nonne wohnt, die sehr natürlich ist, und mit der ich mich sehr gut verstehe. Ich schaue zufällig mal in ihr Zimmer herein. Es ist ein altes Herrenzimmer der Wohnung. Es riecht nach Rauch. Sie raucht also. Ich musste mir ja das Rauchen abgewöhnen (auf ärztlichen Rat). Ich schlendere dann weiter durch die Wohnung und entdecke andere, viel stilvoller eingerichtete und hellere Räume als die an uns vermieteten. In einem steht nur ein Bett aus der Zeit Napoleons, ein Fürstenbett auf spiegelblanken Parkett. Die Räume werden immer freundlicher und heller. Ich bin nicht mehr Mieter, sondern Sohn. Der Vater, dem ich aber kühl gegenüberstehe, hat einige Schelling-Bände und ein griechisches Lexikon, die ich liegen liess, in sein Zimmer genommen. Auch das Mädchen -- die Nonne -- ist seine Tochter, aber darum nicht meine Schwester. Dies Verhältnis ist im Traum nicht weiter problematisch. Sie ist auf eine Terrasse und in den Garten hinausgetreten und hat nur ein durchsichtiges Nylonnachthemd an. Darin ist sie wunderschön. Ich treffe sie, denn ein Diener hat alle Türen abgeschlossen und sie kann nicht ins Haus zurück. Zuerst untersuchen wir alle Fenster. Aber nirgends kann man hineinklettern. Ich habe den Eindruck, durch einige obere Luken könnte man es vielleicht doch -- aber sie will es wohl im Grunde gar nicht. Dann ist sie an den Rand des Gartens zu den Kräuterbeeten gegangen, ohne sich darum zu kehren, dass man sie von draussen und von den Tennisplätzen sehen kann. Hier ist alles taufrisch. Ich treffe sie ganz verändert und völlig entspannt auf dem Rasen wieder, auf dem ihre nackten Füsse gehen. Sie ist zu einer reifen Frau geworden und sagt: "Dort hat sich alles in mir verändert (an dem Kräuterbeeten)." Ich bin sehr froh darüber, denn ich liebe das Mädchen. Später hat sie einen Mantel übergeworfen, so dass man den nackten Körper nicht mehr sieht -- und zwar dort, wo ihr Vater sie aus dem Esszimmer sehen kann. Ich frage sie: "Ist es Dir nun doch nicht mehr egal, dass Du nackt bist?" "Doch, aber die Sonnenstrahlen schaden der Haut." (353 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1719 (1956-08-29 - Freiburg)In einem Tunnel tritt mir eine junge Frau in Hosen entgegen und sagt: "Entschuldigen Sie bitte, können Sie mir vielleicht Feuer geben?" Ich sage: "Augenblick mal, ich will mal nachsehen" und greife in meine Hosentaschen. Die Frau tritt ganz dicht an mich heran und drückt ihren Bauch gegen den meinen. Ich sehe dabei, dass ihr Gesicht schon ein wenig verlebt aussieht, und entdecke Sommersprossen um die etwas ausdruckslosen Augen. Als sie merkt, dass ich wirklich Streichhölzer suche, tritt sie enttäuscht zurück. Ich begreife, dass dies eine Form ist, wie Dirnen einen anreden, und erwache mit dem Gedanken zu antworten: "Auch so, das Feuer wollen Sie." (105 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1721 (1956-09-03 - Freiburg)Umfangreiche Träume, die mir nach dem Erwachen noch ganz deutlich waren. Jetzt nur noch Bruchstücke und kleine Splitter. Ich bekam ein Kleinauto -- offen -- einen sehr kleinen Wagen. Der Boden war aber mit Wachs und Lehm bedeckt. Ich kratzte ihn ab. Weder der Schenker, noch der Verkäufer hatten es bemerkt. Andere Szene: An einem Gartenzaun. Vier blonde Jungens, von denen drei ganz genau Ernst Jünger ähnlich sahen. Sie hatten seine blauen Augen und blonde Haare. Zuvor hatte ich bei mir einen ganzen Stapel von Büchern mit persönlicher Widmung Jüngers gefunden, darunter solche, die ich früher von ihm noch nicht besessen hatte. Ich wunderte mich, da ich doch lange, etwa fünf Jahre, keinen Kontakt mehr mit ihm hatte. Ein Buch war neu -- von 1956 -- und mit einer umfangreichen Widmung. Vielleicht hatte Jünger mein Manuskript des Webetanzes wieder gefunden und dazu Stellung genommen. Nun sprach ich also mit den vier Jungens, von denen drei genau wie Jünger aussahen. Ich fragte: "Wie heisst ihr?" Der Älteste sagte von den dreien: "Claus, Dieter und Peter." - "Und der vierte?" Der Älteste antwortete wiederum: "Das ist nicht der vierte, sondern der fünfte. Der vierte ist gestorben, dies ist der Sohn von unserem Stiefvater -- ich weiss nicht, wie er heisst." Der Kleine sah den anderen dreien, die sich genau glichen, trotzdem noch ziemlich ähnlich. Ich sah nun durch den Zaun hindurch auf das Haus, wo ich in einem Fenster zu ebener Erde -- fast im Keller - die Mutter und den Mann entdeckte, der mich musterte. Ich ging zu ihnen herein und sprach mit ihnen. Hier wird die Erinnerung des Traumes dunkel. Die nächste Szene, die ich erinnere, spielt auf einem Tanzfest. Zwei junge Mädchen waren einander sehr ähnlich -- die eine war mit ihrer Mutter da -- Mutter und Tochter sahen etwas fremdländisch aus und spielten darauf an. Ich überlegte, ob sie Juden oder Russen seien. Ich verglich die Mädchen in allen einzelnen Zügen miteinander, und wir sprachen zu dritt- beide Mädchen und ich -- darüber. Das andere Mädchen liebte ich an sich sehr: Sie hatte die kräftigeren Lippen und etwas gewellte Haare. Bei dem fremdländischen Mädchen dagegen war die Oberlippe schmal und eingezogen, die Unterlippe dagegen ebenfalls vorgewölbt. Die Haare glatt. Sonst war alles, Nase, Augen, Ohren, fast gleich, vor allem die Kopfform. Dann ist wieder ein Stück des Traums dunkel. -- Andere Szene: Die Stimmung war inzwischen fortgeschrittener. Ich ging mit dem einen Mädchen, dem, das ich mehr liebte, zu der Stelle zurück, wo wir vorher gesessen und über ihre Identität mit der anderen, fremdländischeren gesprochen hatten. Da sah sie einen Stapel Photographien liegen, den die andere zusammen mit ihrer fremdländischen Mutter gemacht hatte, und zum Teil -- es waren farbige -- gezeigt hatte. Ich nahm die Photographien auf und sah die erste an. Da entdeckte ich, dass ich die Mädchen verwechselt hatte. Das Mädchen, mit dem ich gegangen war, war das fremdländische, das auf den Photographien zu sehen war, und nicht das andere, wie ich dachte, und von dem ich gedacht hatte, dass es mir näher stünde. Das Mädchen lächelte, als es dies merkte. Es war eine von jenen merkwürdigen Entdeckungen, die uns wie ein Blitz durchzucken und mit einem Schlage die ganze Situation verändern, die ganze Welten verändern, so wie wenn zwei Menschen entdecken, dass nicht nur der eine den anderen liebt, sondern der andere auch ihn liebt. Dies war hier nur in dem Lächeln enthalten. Die Entdeckung ging so vor sich: Ich betrachtete zunächst unbeteiligt und noch meiner Meinung sicher flüchtig die Frabphotographien. Dann sah ich aber, dass darunter noch andere Schwarz-weiss-Photographien waren -die ja immer mehr Charme haben, als die etwas unechten farbigen , welche der Phantasie keinen Spielraum lassen -; die Mutter und Tochter uns nicht gezeigt hatten. Das Mädchen wollte auch diese sehen. Ich fand das aber eine Indiskretion, weil Mutter und Tochter sie uns selbst ja nicht gezeigt hatten, sagte dies und wollte die Tasche zuklappen. Dabei fiel mein Blick aber auf das erste dieser Bilder, das die Tochter in einem sehr charmanten Gewand und lächelnd zeigte -- diese Bilder waren gleichsam intimer und darum weniger fremd. Hier erkannte ich die Identität und schaute in das lächelnde Gesicht das Mädchens, das ich verwechselt hatte. Merkwürdig ist aber, dass gerade hier der Funke übersprang; "Du bist es also eigentlich". Dann ist wieder ein Stück des Traums dunkel. In der nächsten Szene war ich nackt -- in einem anderen Raum --, die Stimmung war viel fortgeschrittener. Es war aber noch das selbe Fest. Die Mädchen -- viele - kamen herein in das Zimmer, und ich stürzte mich auf ein kleines, sehr junges und sehr fremdländisches Mädchen. Es hatte ein Kleid an, das den Körper zwischen Hüfte und Brust ein Stück weit frei liess, und ich umarmte ihre warme Haut und zog sie an mich. Sie schaute mich voller Übereinstimmung und doch zugleich traurig an und sagte: "Ich habe es Dir doch gesagt, ich habe doch die Periode". Das Ende des Traums ist dann wieder dunkel. (831 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1722 (1956-09-04 - Freiburg)Beerdigung meiner Mutter. Ich suche aus einer Kommode ein Nachthemd für die Leiche heraus, die vor mir aufgebahrt liegt. Ich wähle ein grünes, weil es besser aussieht als ein weisses. Aus dem Radio tönt ernste Musik. Max Müller kommt zu mir heran, nachdem die anderen Beerdigungsgäste fortgegangen sind. Aus dem Radio kommt -- gerade als er herantritt -- leichte Musik, weil das Konzert aus ist. Max Müller scheint davon befremdet zu sein. Ich sage zu ihm: "Einen Augenblick, ich will nur noch schnell die scheussliche Musik ausmachen", immer noch vor der Kommode auf dem Boden kauernd, auf dem oben die Leiche meiner Mutter aufgebahrt ist. Da ich aber die Bedienung des Radios nicht kenne, gelingt es mir nicht gleich, den Apparat auszumachen, und die leichte Musik tönt noch eine Weile hinaus, was mir sehr peinlich ist. (136 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1724 (1956-09-05 - Freiburg)Im Winkel alter Strassen ein altes Haus, dessen Souterrain ein einziger Banktresor zu sein scheint. Ich steige einige Stufen hinauf, die in eine Wohnung darüber führen -- das eigentliche Wohnhaus, und öffne aus Neugierde die Tür -- es ist mitten in der Nacht -- und trete ein. Als hätten sie auf mich gewartet, stehen ein alter Herr und eine alte, etwas verkrüppelte Dame drinnen auf der hölzernen Treppe im Halbschatten -- und ich höre als erstes, als ich die Tür geöffnet habe, aus dem nächtlichen Haus ihre Stimmen: "Guten Tag, Herr von Uslar." Ich bin entsetzt und sage schnell: "Ich habe nur ein Klosett gesucht" (das war wohl tatsächlich mit ein Grund meines Eintretens) und schaue auf eine Tür rechts, die mir so aussieht, als könnte sie in ein Klosett führen. Die Frau antwortet: "Das können Sie haben" und führt mich höflich und bestimmt heraus aus dem Haus, die Steintreppe herunter. Offenbar ist das Klosett ausser dem Haus, ein altmodisches Plumpsklo.

Diese Worte zu mir gesprochen von einem Wesen, das Züge von Bender, Specht und anderen trug, waren das Ende eines Traums, aus dem ich eben erwachte und der doch sofort undeutlich wurde. Der Sinn des Satzes war etwa: "Sie haben eine Art, Verse einleuchtend, brilliant zu verstehen, die Quintessenz herauszuhören." Die Szene war etwa folgende: Eine Frau wurde psychiatrisch untersucht und dabei einer neurologischen Prüfung unterzogen. Ihre Reflexe waren in Ordnung. Sonst schien sie aber gestört zu sein. Das Ganze in einer Art Vorlesung. Der Vortragende schloss mit einem Vers. Ich sagte darauf irgend etwas über diesen Vers zu ihm, und er sagte darauf hin die Antwort, nach der ich aufwachte und die mir ganz deutlich blieb. (125 words)

Es war der Landschaft eingeschmiegt. Durch ein grosses Fenster blickte man in eine heimelig aussehenden Raum. "Das ist unser Zimmer", sagte Emme, "sieht es nicht doll aus, da hereinzugucken." Wir gingen durch eine Tür hinein. Das Zimmer war in eine Rundung gefügt, wie im inneren Gang des inneren Ohrs. Alles war hier sehr organisch in der Form. Das grosse Fenster liess reichlich Licht herein. Ein kleiner Stutzflügel stand etwas tiefer. Stufen führten zu einem zweiten Teil des Zimmers hinauf. Die Wände waren weiss. Es gefiel mir sehr gut.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1729 (1956-09-07 - Freiburg)Vorher anderer Traum: Die Schwägerin von Frl. Baumgarten wohnte wieder in der Speisekammer, die diesmal wie ganz früher mit weissen Möbeln eingerichtet war. (Nur im Traum so). . Ich schrieb ihr einen Brief, den ich aber später wieder vernichtete, weil Wasser und Fettflecke darauf gekommen waren. Andere Szene spielte bei Hasselblatts. Er überlegte, ob er ganz Philosophie oder ganz Romanistik studieren sollte (in Wirklichkeit ist sein zweites Fach Germanistik, nicht Romanistik, was mir im Traum nicht auffiel). Man riet ihm ab von Romanistik. Er argumentierte mit einem romanistischen Aufsatz, der ihm gut gefallen hatte. Seine Frau (das "Wert-Fräulein") antwortete: "Ja, aber was Dir an diesem Aufsatz gefallen hat, ist gerade wieder das Philosophische". Ich fand diese Antwort gut und sehr treffend. -- An diese Szene anschliessend kam dann die zuerst berichtete und das Schild, Dr. v. Uslar -- Habituelle Seinsberatung." Noch weiter vorher war aber eine andere Szene, in der ich Heidegger besuchte. Er sagte: "Bleiben Sie doch zum Kaffee", hatte diese Aufforderung aber schon am Ende des Satzes wieder vergessen, sprach sie von neuem aus, nahm sie wieder zurück und so weiter. Es war ein vollendetes Bild der Zerstreutheit gegenüber dem täglichen Leben. Noch andere Szenen des Traums waren von merkwürdigen Phantasien angefüllt, die wohl auch im Traum nur Phantasien waren, vielleicht Vorbereitungen zu einem Film oder Buch: Nackt in Meere tauchen, in wilder Brandung, um irgend etwas heraufzuholen. Eine Frau in Rot, auf deren nackten Körper der Taucher, der ich selbst war, gelegt wurde. Nähere Zusammenhänge kann ich hier nicht mehr herstellen, auch weiss ich nicht, wo in der Szenenfolge des Traums diese Szene war, ich meine vor der Heidegger-Szene. (272 words)

Ich bin erstaunt, denn sie hat noch vier Kinder. Später wird mir klar, dass ich Dolo mit meiner Cousine Gisela Haas verwechselt habe. Dann kommen wir in Anlagen und erkennen schliesslich die Strasse wieder, die in unsere Wohnung führt, nachdem wir uns in die Richtung gestellt haben -- erst mit dem richtigen Einorden von rechts und links, vorne und hinten wird die Gegend schlagartig bekannt, - so ähnlich, wie wenn man morgens nach dem Erwachen in noch dunklem Zimmer nicht weiss, wo rechts und links, wo die Wand neben dem Bett, und wo das Zimmer ist, und schlagartig wird es einem klar. - Andere Szene: Ich sitze in meinem Bett und versuche, mit einem Gewehr auf eine schwarze Figur an der Wand (Stück von einem Bild) zu schiessen. (Wahrscheinlich das Gesicht, das neulich als Bambis Augen im Traum auftauchte). Immer, wenn ich Kimme, Korn und den weissen Punkt des Ziels in eine Richtung gebracht habe, streckt Emme ihren Kopf dazwischen, und ich kann nicht abdrücken. Ich bin verärgert, und es gibt fast Streit darüber. (193 words)

Er sass mit Emme und mir im Käfig. Er hatte ein feingeschnittenes Profil, eigenwillige Bewegungen und sehr wellige Haare, in die er etwas verliebt war. -- Andere Szene: Jetzt war wieder Gisela da, ausserdem Emme und ihr Mann Peter. Gisela und Emme waren in den Käfig gegangen, sie wollten wohl allein sein -- aber Peter war auch mitgegangen. Emme hatte sich ins Kinderbett gekauert, Gisela lag ausgestreckt auf dem gelben Bett und Peter kauerte an der Seite in der Nische, wo wir das Bettzeug unterbringen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1733 (1956-09-16 - Freiburg)Zu Besuch in Wittmoldt. Ich schlief in einem Zimmer, das ich nur durch Feelis und Dolos Schlafzimmer erreichen konnte. Nun hatte ich ein blaues Nachthemd, das aus einem harten Stoff war und darum kratzte. Ich sagte es Feeli, und sie gab mir ihr rotes, das ich anzog. Es war ein wenig durchsichtig und von einem tief leuchtenden Rot. Später, als ich durch das Zimmer ging -- Dolo und Feeli lagen schon im Bett -- hatte ich meinen blauen Bademantel darüber gezogen. Ich sass in dem Zimmer einen Moment auf dem Stuhl, während ich mit Dolo und Feeli plauderte. Dabei fiel mein Blick in den Spiegel und ich sagte: "Das ist wirklich ein sehr schönes Rot". Es war ein tiefes glühendes Rubinrot mit ein wenig Beimischung von der Farbe des Siegellacks. "Aber der blaue Bademantel passt nicht dazu", meinte ich. - "Du kannst meinen roten anziehen", sagte Feeli und reichte mir ihren roten Bademantel, der auf dem Stuhl neben ihrem Bett lag und in der Farbe sehr schön mit dem rubinroten Nachthemd harmonierte. Ich zog meinen blauen Mantel aus, um den roten anzuziehen, hatte aber das Gefühl, dass jemand an der Tür sei, und schaute darum durch die durchsichtige Glasscheibe der Tür hinaus. Hier entdeckte ich direkt vor der Scheibe Mölöchens Gesicht. Sie wollte gerade hereinkommen. Ich tat also so, als wäre ich nur durch das Zimmer gegangen und sagte freundlich zu Dolo und Feeli "Gute Nacht", während Mölöchen, ihre Mutter ins Zimmer hineinkam, und ich in das meine hinausging. Ich hatte mich gerade auf meinem Bett niedergelassen, als Mölöchens Bruder, Feelis Onkel, hereinkam, der im Traum Arzt war. Er hatte eine braune Kordsamthose an, die meinem Anzug glich. "Ich verlange von Ihnen, dass Sie sich bei Feeli entschuldigen -- unerhört ist das..." und nun folgte eine ganze Reihe von Beschuldigungen. Es war ein richtiger kleiner Skandal. Er stellte sich bei meinem Besuch im roten Nachthemd, das Mölöchen entdeckt hat, das Furchtbarste vor, und entdeckte nicht das harmlose Kleiderspiel, das es war. Ich sagte ihm, so liesse ich nicht mit mir reden, er schiene sich ja etwas Verrücktes von mir vorzustellen. "Im Gegenteil", antwortete er, "Sie sind ein entsetzlich energischer und normaler Deutscher". Ich war über diese Charakteristik eigentlich erfreut, die mir als seltenes Lob erschien, und erwiderte: "Das ist endlich mal etwas Anderes, sonst heisst es immer absurd und unnormal". Er musste lachen und ich erwachte. (396 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1734 (1956-09-17 - Freiburg)Grosses Renaissancegebäude in München im Stile der italienischen Renaissance. Ruine. Mächtige Fassade noch ganz erhalten -- auch die Stockwerke. Verwirrende Treppen, von denen man manchmal nicht weiss, ob sie rauf- oder runtergehen, eine spindelförmig geführte Treppe, die grossen Raum einnimmt, ist zwischen den Stufen teilweise so mit Asphalt- oder Zement ausgefüllt, dass sich eine Art schräger Fahrbahn ergibt, auf der auch Autos fahren konnten. Alles sehr grossräumig. Herrlich wäre es, hier zu wohnen. Ich baue in Gedanken das Haus aus, während ich mit einer Führungsgesellschaft, den Teilnehmern einer Omnibusfahrt, durch das Haus stieg. Ich würde es sehr modern ausbauen, nicht renovieren, sondern die Ruine belassen und mit schlanken Betonpfeilern, die unverputzt wären, nur den nötigen Innenausbau bewerkstelligen. Zu alten Ruinen würden gleichzeitig Betonkonstuktionen, die sich nicht verleugnen, besser passen als wortgetreue Renovationen. (132 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1735 (1956-09-26 - Freiburg)Reise nach Karlsruhe, veranstaltet von Max Müller. Wir fuhren mit der Eisenbahn, doch eine ungewöhnliche Route. Max Müller wollte von verschiedenen Stationen aus Exkursionen in Seitentäler des Schwarzwaldes machen. Auch die ganze Reise war eine Art Exkursion -- eben nach Karlsruhe, also nach einem geläufigen Ort auf ungeläufigem Weg. In der Bahn sass auch Heiss. Ich sass ihm schräg gegenüber, doch auf diese Weise von Emme getrennt. Jemand bot nun einen Platzwechsel an, doch da Heiss gerade einen Vortrag hielt, wollte ich ihn dadurch nicht stören. Später kam seine Assistentin, die Emme schräg gegenüber gesessen hatte, und tauschte mit mir den Platz. Später war ich mit der Behandlung eines jungen Patienten beschäftigt. Es ging darum, ob er im Pfistertest Violett gelegt hatte, und wieviel. Ich sprach mit Heiss darüber, der in seiner etwas ambivalent flüchtigen Art sich zu dem Gespräch stellte. Auch dies spielte wohl noch auf der Reise. (149 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1736 (1956-09-28 - Freiburg)Ich war von Aussenminister v. Brentano eingeladen, ihn in einer Villa zu besuchen, die ich früher als den Sitz des Institut Français kannte. Ich betrat die quadratische Halle, in der es sehr dunkel war, so dass ich die Schilder auf den Türen nicht lesen konnte, und so nicht wusste, wo ich mich melden sollte. Ich suchte einen Lichtschalter, fand aber nur einen Knopf, der aussah wie ein Licht- oder Klingelknopf. Ich drückte ihn, doch nichts erfolgte. Durch eine Türspalt sah in einen Bibliotheks- und Kartei-artig eingerichteten Raum, in dem ich mehrere Menschen sah. Ich trat ein. Ein Mann -- offensichtlich ein Beamter -- fuhr mich barsch an: "Wo ist ihr Bon, ihr Kassenbon?" Ich fragte erstaunt: "Einen Kassenbon?" - "Sie müssen doch einen Bon haben, wenn Sie herein wollen". - "Der Herr Aussenminister hat mich eingeladen, ich habe seine Karte bei mir. " - "Zeigen Sie sie, dann können Sie ohne weiteres nach oben gehen." Ich schlug meine Mappe auf und begann zu suchen. Als erstes fasste ich einige Bögen unbeschriebenes Notenpapier, aus einem Heft, in dem ich früher Volkstänze aufgeschrieben hatte. Der Mann nahm es mir aus der Hand und sagte: "Das werde ich erst einmal behalten." Ich war empört. Hier wurde man wie ein Spion behandelt. Ich wollte meiner Empörung Ausdruck geben und erwachte.

Vorher war ich im Keller von Benders Haus, wo eine Art Büro war, das zugleich Klo war. Ich wühlte, während ich dort sass, in den Papieren, obwohl sie mich nichts mehr angingen, da ich nicht mehr dort oben arbeitete. Ich suchte auch Postkarten, die aus Schwerin an mich adressiert waren, um die Postleitzahl dieser Stadt zu finden, die ich für einen Fragebogen brauchte, eine Art Volkszählung. Ich fand schliesslich auf einem Poststapel die Postleitzahl 14a und war sehr gerührt, denn sie erinnerte mich an vieles. Später kam dann Bender, der misstrauisch zu sein schien über meinen langen Aufenthalt dort unten, und nach ihm seine Sekretärin, die jünger war, als ich gedacht hatte (und auch als in Wirklichkeit) und nach Laurentia Mauretania fragte. -- Das Büro, in dem schon Müller gearbeitet hatte, zeigte übrigens, dass das Haus auf ein altes grösseres Fundament gebaut war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1739 (1956-10-07 - Freiburg)Unsere Wohnung war gleichzeitig die Wohnung meines Elternhauses wie auch die jetzt eine Etage tiefer gelegene. Ich merke plötzlich, dass wir ja in den Räumen wohnten, in denen ich meine ganze Kindheit verbracht hatte, und begann Emme nun zu erklären, wo jedes Möbelstück gestanden hatte. Ich war dabei in Hochstimmung und alles war sonnendurchflutet. Dann orientierte ich mich in den Fenstern. Ich wusste, welchen Blick man aus jedem hatte, stellte aber fest, dass eines mehr da war, was mich zuerst verwirrte. Es war das Fenster unserer jetzigen Stube (das von meinem Bett gesehen in eine Richtung geht, wo in der Schweriner Stube kein Fenster war. (Offenbar war der Traum eine Orientierung mit dem schon morgendlichen Zimmer, so wie sie Marcel Proust im Anfang von Swanns Welt beschreibt, wo das Bewusstsein noch nicht weiss, in welchem der vielen Zimmer des Lebens es sich befindet. Sie sind noch ineinander verschachtelt. -- An solchen Unebenheiten wie der Zahl und der Lage der Fenster merkt man es). Andere Szene: Billchen klettert auf den Tisch und in Windeseile zum Fenster hinaus. Sie fiel schon über den Rand des Blumenbretts, als ich zupacken konnte. Ich packte zunächst ihr Kleid und fühlte dann unter dem Stoff ihren feinen Glieder, so dass ich Emme zurufen konnte: "Ich hab sie ganz fest" - . Während ich sie mühsam hochzog, presste ich mich so fest ans Fensterbrett, dass ich mit meiner Brust die Blumentöpfe umstiess. -- Andere Szene: Ich entdeckte in der Wohnung eine Klingel, deren Ton wir nicht gewohnt waren. Es war keine der gebrauchten Glocken. Emme sagte: "Jetzt wird Herr Seiler" -- das war im Traum der Oberbewohner - "denken, es wäre seine Glocke". Der Mann kam auch schon -- war empört -- drang in die Wohnung herein und riss einfach die Drähte des Klingelautomaten heraus. Ich war empört, stellte ihn zur Rede. Er wurde handgreiflich. Ich warf ihn zu Boden und sagte: "Sie können mit ihren Patienten umgehen, aber nicht mit Klingeln". Der Mann ist Heilpraktiker. (329 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1741 (1956-10-12 - Freiburg)Wir fuhren in einer Strassenbahn einen steilen Hang hinunter. Emme sass mir gegenüber am Fenster. Am Fuss des Hanges kreuzten die Strassenbahnschienen eine Eisenbahnlinie. Als der Fahrer sie gerade überqueren wollte, brauste ein Zug heran. Er musste so hart bremsen, dass der Wagen einen kurzen Bocksprung machte. Doch das Gefälle war so stark, dass der Wagen sich nicht völlig bremsen liess. Zentimeter um Zentimeter näherte er sich dem vorbeibrausenden Zuge, dessen Wagen mit Langholz beladen war, das in unsere Fenster hineingerammt wäre, genau dort, wo wir sassen. Die Fahrgäste schiene die Gefahr der Situation kaum zu erfassen. Nur der Schaffner schien sich darüber klar zu sein. Er sprach dem Fahrer, der verzweifelt immer wieder an der Bremse riss, von hinten Mut zu und redete ihn dabei mit dem Vornamen an, wie es zwischen Fahrer und Schaffner üblich ist. Mir fiel diese Einzelheit in dieser kritischen Situation auf. Immer weiter näherte sich der Wagen Ruck um Ruck dem vorbeifahrenden Zuge, der sehr lang war. Ich hob die Hand, um Emme für den Fall des Zusammenstosses vom Sitz zu reissen, um sie vor dem Langholz zu schützen. Aufstehen wollte ich nicht, um keine Panik zu verursachen. Drei extra fahrende Wagen, die von einer eigenen Lokomotive am Ende des Zuges geschoben wurden. Der Fahrer der Lokomotive erfasste sofort die Gefahr, als er unseren Wagen sah. Ich hörte, wie er seinem Heizer zurief: "Sollen wir zurücksetzen?" sich dann aber zur Weiterfahrt entschloss, weil die Chance grösser war, uns so zu schützen. Der Zug war passiert, ohne dass es zum Zusammenstoss gekommen war und ich erwachte. (261 words)

Meine Mutter beugt sich oben im Treppenhaus über die Brüstung -- sie ist schon etwas verwirrt -- und ruft mir zu, wenn ich in die Stadt ginge, solle ich doch bei Scipio und Succius, und noch ein lateinischer Name, vorbeigehen und das und das besorgen. Die Pflegerin will sie bei jedem Wort zurückreissen. Ich finde das ungerecht, wenn auch, was sie sagt, für uns sinnlos ist, so kann man es doch anhören und darauf eingehen. - Anderer Traum -- zwischendurch Erwachen: Wir wollen wieder ins Elternhaus einziehen.

Der Balkon vor ihrem und unserem Fenster kommt mir viel grösser vor, als ich ihn aus der Kinderzeit in Erinnerung habe (also umgekehrt, als es sanst zu geschehen pflegt). Andere Szene: In unserem Zimmer steht einer der alten Chippendale-Stühle aus dem Elternhaus. Auf den Betten sausen viele Mäuse umher. Doch dann sehe ich vor dem Fenster "die" schwarze Katze. Ich öffne. Sie springt in einem riesigen Satz aufs Bett und jagt Mäuse. Dann erscheint Tante Heidi (Adelheid v. der Ropp aus Wittmoldt) und bringt uns ihren Hund, mit der Bitte, ihn auszuführen. Es ist im Traum eine grosse Bulldogge (in Wirklichkeit hat sie einen kleinen Dackel). Der Hund zieht so an der Leine, dass ich sie verliere. Doch kann ich sie noch packen, ehe wir aus dem Haus herausgehen. Draussen sind es aber Pferde, die wir zu lenken haben. Emme und ich je ein Pferd und Wagen. Wir sollen Bis-zu-fahren. Wir folgen einfach den Spuren, die über den Hof führen. Die Erde ist von ihnen tief aufgerissen. Wir wissen nicht, wo sie hinführen. (308 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1743 (1956-10-15 - Freiburg)Bender hatte eine Wohnung für uns, Talstrasse 66, Strassenbahnhaltestelle: Talstrasse 60. Ich war zu Besuch bei Frl. Strauch in seinem Institut. Bender kam und fragte, ob ich noch einen anderen Grund meines Kommens habe. Ich sagte: "Haben Sie etwa eine Wohnung für mich?" Er: "Ja -- ich hatte ein Haus in Bremen zu vergeben. Dabei waren noch Möbel, Tisch und Stuhl von meinem Vater. Die Leute", so fuhr er fort, "waren gerührt gewesen und hatten gesagt, dass sie eine Wohnung in Freiburg zu vergeben hätten, Talstrasse 66". Dies sei das Haus, in dem seine Eltern früher gewohnt hätten. Benders Schwester, die dabei war, fiel hier ins Gespräch ein und sagt: "Ja, ja, Talstrasse 66 und die Strassenbahnhaltestelle war ganz in der Nähe: 'Talstrasse 60 Haltestelle' hatte der Schaffner ausgerufen." Ich überlegte im Traum, wo Talstrasse 66 sei, und dachte dabei an ein Gebäude, das mich immer im Baustil an die Schweriner Post erinnert, aber schon in der Fortsetzung der Talstrasse, in der Nähe des Messplatzes liegt.

Sie erzählte, dass sie eine durchsichtigen Unterrock habe, und dass es gut sei, dass wir nicht im Hotel zusammen wohnen müssten, sonst könnte ich sie dadurch sehen. Ich dachte: so hat sie also denselben geheimen Wunsch, dass ihre Röcke gleichsam durchsichtig seien. Dann wurde ihr eine Nachricht vom Tode ihrer Mutter gebracht. Sie weinte und bekam ganz blaue Arme, so dass ich mir Sorgen machte. Eine ältere Frau, die nun als Pflegeperson bei ihr war, wollte mich fortschicken, da ich sie in ihrer Trauer nur stören könne.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1745 (1956-10-19 - Freiburg)Ich wollte mit meinem Vater und einem Freund meines Vaters, den ich zuvor schon sehr gut hatte reiten sehen, was ich ihm gesagt hatte, ausreiten. Wir wohnten im Elternhaus. Vor demselben war ein Hof mit den Stallungen, der dem Schulhof des Schweriner Gymnasiums glich. (Was mir im Traum nicht weiter auffiel. In Wirklichkeit hat das Elternhaus keinen Hof, sondern ist eine Villa). Ungefähr am Platz der Turnhalle waren die Stallungen, am Platz der Fahrradständer der Sattelplatz. Als ich mein Pferd dort hin führte -- mein Vater hatte mir ein ruhiges Pferd gegeben, das Alex hiess -- schloss gerade Professor Ruffin, der Freiburger Psychiater den Hof ab, was er allabendlich tat. Ich wollte meinen Vater fragen, wie eng ich den Sattelgurt schnallen müsse, und erwachte. (Nach dem Erwachen überlegte ich mir noch im Halbschlaf, welchen Weg wir nehmen wollten. Ich stellte mir einen Ritt durch den Wald vor, vielleicht mit einem Klettern durch die Kiesgruben -- dann den steilen Hohlweg über Zippendorf hoch -- wo mir mein Vater das Radfahren beigebracht hatte, und von wo man den herrlichen Blick auf den See hatte.)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1746 (1956-10-19 - Freiburg)Ich schob den Kinderwagen durch die Stadt Schwerin. Doch war der Griff so hoch, dass ich ihn nur mit ausgerecktem Arm fassen konnte. (so hoch, wie er für Billchen sein muss, wenn sie jetzt ihren Wagen manchmal schiebt, was mir aber im Traum gar nicht auffiel.) Das Schieben war auf diese Weise beschwerlich, und ich kam nur schwankend vorwärts. Später traf ich ein reizendes junges Mädchen, mit dessen älterer Schwester ich früher Tanzstunde gehabt hatte. Sie begleitete mich. Wir kamen uns immer näher. Wir umarmten uns schliesslich im Gehen immer enger und enger. Es war wunderschön -- so gingen wir -- immer den Wagen schiebend -- über beide Schlossbrücken und die Schlossinsel zu den barocken Kaskaden, wo man oben im Mondschein die Offiziersmesse liegen sah. Ich sagte: "Im Mondschein ist sogar dieses (sonst verbaute) Gebäude schön." Es war tatsächlich schöner als sonst, von barocker Architektur und hob sich prachtvoll gegen den violetten Mondhimmel ab. Wir hatten jetzt uns so eng umarmt, dass der hohe Wagen, den wir schoben, zu kippen drohte. Ich sprach noch eine Warnung aus, als er auch schon kippte. Ich rief: "Nun ist die Puppe rausgefallen", lief entsetzt nach vorne, um mein Kind aufzuheben und erwachte. (199 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1747 (1956-10-19 - Freiburg)Verbrecher -- unter ihnen eine wunderschöne Frau, die ich liebte. Sie hatte eine Pistole bei sich -- auch ich. Sie sagte, ihre Tante -- ein altes Weib -- habe gesagt, ehe sie stürbe, würde sie sie mit sich nehmen, weil das Leben nicht lebenswert sei. Also schlossen wir die Türen, ehe wir miteinander ins Bett gingen, damit diese Frau ihre Mordabsichten nicht durchführen könne. Dann erinnerte ich mich des Verbrechers, der neulich durch die Fenster eingebrochen war. Ich liess darum von unserer alten Beschliesserin die grossen Läden mit den Eisenstangen vor die Fenster machen. So waren wir jetzt abgeschlossen und gesichert -- auch vom Vater des Verbrechermädchens, der ebenfalls eine Pistole hatte. Doch da öffnete die Beschliesserin die Fenster, um irgend etwas zu holen, und schon war der Verbrecher da. Ich holte heimlich mit einem Sprung den Revolver, den ich im Bett versteckt hatte, um mich notfalls auch gegen das Verbrechermädchen zu schützen. Doch ehe ich ihn entsichern konnte, versuchte der Verbrecher, ihn mir aus der Hand zu schlagen. Es gelang ihm nicht. Aber während ich noch meinen Revolver entsicherte, entsicherte er schneller den seinen und drückte ab, doch es war eine Fehlzündung, der Schuss ging nicht los. Nun drückte ich den meinen ab, doch auch dieser ging nicht los, so versuchten wir beide, abwechselnd vergeblich, unsere Revolver auf uns zum Abschuss zu bringen -- es war sozusagen ein Duell von Fehlzündungen. Ich zog aus der Situation die Konsequenz und schlug einen ewigen Frieden vor, in den auch das Verbrechermädchen, die böse Tante und alle anderen Verbrecher einbezogen waren. Wir schlossen den Vertrag und ich erwachte. (266 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1748 (1956-10-24 - Freiburg)Ich war auf einem Tanzfest, auf dem ich niemand kannte. Da entdeckte ich Christa, Hf.'sSchwester. Sie hatte einen weissen gestrickten Anzug an, mit einzelnen blauen Streifen, der ihr eine sehr tänzerische, sagenhafte Erscheinung gab. Wir tanzten nach einer Slowfox-artigen Melodie und harmonierten dabei wunderbar. Wir schwebten in getragenen Tönen über den Boden. (Als ich erwachte, erkannte ich die Melodie als ein Stück aus einer Suite von Bach). Merkwürdigerweise hatte ich beim Tanz meine Baskenmütze aufbehalten und die Leute guckten mich darum erstaunt an. Als ich es merkte, musste ich lachen und nahm sie ab. (Ich hatte in Wirklichkeit während des Traums eine Nachtmütze auf, die ich mir aufgesetzt hatte, weil es vom offenen Fenster her zog). Beim nächsten Tanz wollte ich Christa fragen, warum sie mir von der Mütze auf meinem Kopf nichts gesagt hatte. Als ich keine Antwort bekam, bemerkte ich erst, dass ich diesmal mit einem ganz kleinen Mädchen im dunklen Trainingsanzug tanzte, bei dem man noch gar nicht genau wusste, ob es nicht ein kleiner Junge war. Doch tanzte es genauso schwebend. (175 words)

Später tanzte ich ganz nackt und mit ausgerecktem Glied und setzte mir dazu eine russische Kosakenmütze auf den Kopf, die eine der Frauen hatte. Vor der Tanzszene erinnere ich noch den Anfang des Festes. Wir standen noch herum. Das Mädchen mit schwarzen Haaren und hellblauen Augen gefiel mir. Sie hatte eine leuchtend blaue gestrickte Jacke wie einen Panzer am Oberkörper über dem Kleid. Sie schien ihren Körper nicht nur zu verhüllen, sondern darzustellen. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1758 (1956-11-24 - Freiburg)Traum von dem siamesischen König mit kahlgeschorenem Kopf (Schauspieler Yul Brynner in dem Film "Der König und ich"). Er war ein beliebter Wunderarzt, lebte in einem reichen Schloss voller Kunstgegenstände in einer wunderbaren Gebirgsgegend, in der ich schon zuvor in anderen Häusern ein Zimmer gesucht hatte. (Vorausgegangene Szene: die Zimmer waren aber alle zu klein). Dann kam ich in das Schloss. Ich war selber Arzt wie er -- trat ihm also als Kollege gegenüber, während er hier in seiner Umgebung unumschränkte Macht hatte und Verehrung genoss. Seine Besucher warteten in verschiedenen Zimmern des Schlosses auf ihn. Er ging von einem Zimmer zum anderen in hastiger Eile, überall ein effektvolles Feuerwerk seiner ärztlichen Genialität abbrennen lassend. Von der Schönheit seines Schlosses genoss er so wenig, weil er nur noch auf Effekt bedacht war. Ich hielt ihn auf einem dieser flüchtigen Gänge an und redete ihm zu, dieses gehetzte Leben aufzugeben, das nur der Eitelkeit diene und ihn aufzehre. Ich müsse ihm als Arzt dies raten. Dann wandelte er sich in der nächsten Szene zum Diktator, der mich zu unterjochen suchte. Die Befreiung nahte schon in Gestalt der Russen. Ich rief die Russen zur Hilfe, während er mich noch schlug, dass das Blut mir aus dem Munde schoss und mein gelbes Perlonhemd rot färbte. (212 words)

Dann wurde ich langsam wach (im Traum) und beugte mich vor. Da bemerkte ich, dass es gar nicht Herr Müller war, der dort gesprochen hatte, sondern ein Beamter der Universitätsbibliothek, der meine, von dort entliehenen, Bücher kontrollieren wollte. Ich war aber immer noch nicht wach genug (im Traum!), um den Vorgang richtig kontrollieren zu können.

Es war ihre Stube in Europa, während sie selbst noch in Australien war. Ich war sehr eigenartig berührt, als ich in ihrem Schrank ihre Kleider bewegte und all die alten Sachen anguckte. Es waren dort sehr feine Stücke aus der Volksdorfer Töpferwerkstatt, die jetzt nicht mehr hergestellt wurden, weil Frl. Maetzel es selbst nicht mehr konnte, und niemand anders da war, der so feine Dinge drehen konnte. Da waren sehr dünne Nadelschälchen und gestreifte Deckel zu Teedosen. Sie alle hatten eine starke Griffqualität. Dann fand ich Briefe, die noch an Ika und mich gemeinsam adressiert waren, darunter auch Briefe von Gisela an uns beide. Dieser Traum ging dann in halbwache Vorstellung und Gedanken an Ika über, die wahrscheinlich noch einmal zum Traum wurden, denn ich hatte heute Morgen das Gefühl von Ika selbst geträumt zu haben -- diese Träume waren sehr erotisch und beschäftigten sich mir ihren kräftigen weiblichen Formen und ihren Brüsten.

Wir hockten direkt nebeneinander auf dem Fussboden. Ich war nach dem Erwachen sehr berührt von der merkwürdigen Identität zwischen Marlies (die längst tot ist - sie kam 1945 bei einem Fliegerangriff auf der Flucht ums Leben) und der jungen Amerikanerin. Beide haben tatsächlich irgend etwas Gemeinsames. Vielleicht das selbstverständliche Einverständnis, das man mit ihnen haben kann -- vielleicht auch die Haare). Vorher im Traum war schon Tante Lu (Marlies's Mutter) da, die auch diese selbstverständliche, natürliche Art hat.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1769 (1956-12-26 - Freiburg)Ich war in einer Schule, das heisst, das merkte ich erst später, zunächst war es nur ein Haus, in dem sehr viele Kinder herumliefen. Es konnten auch Geschwister sein. Eines von ihnen, liess ein Päckchen, oder eine Sache, die es gerade gesammelt hatte, in den Torbogen herabfallen, durch ein Innenfenster. Ich half ihm, die Sachen wiederzufinden, und war so mit den Kindern vertraut. Es war eine Schulklasse. Ihre Lehrerin hiess Frl. Kopp. Ich gehörte nun selbst als Junglehrer zu der Klasse und Frl. Kopp liess mich in der nächsten Stunde rufen. Ich ging durch das Schulgebäude und suchte die richtige Tür. Schliesslich trat ich in eine Tür ein. Die Kinder standen sofort auf. Es waren aber ältere Mädchen und eine andere Lehrerin. Die Mädchen strahlten mich freundlich an und die Lehrerin wies mich in den Nachbarraum, wo Frl. Kopps Klasse sei. Ich erkannte dort auch die Kinder, vor allem den kleinen Jungen, dem ich zuerst geholfen hatte, sah aber Frl. Kopp nicht. Die Kinder hatten Biologieunterricht bei einem Lehrer. Nackte Männer und Frauen machten Übungen vor, aus denen man offenbar Physiologie lernen sollte. Ich fragte den Jungen: "Ist Frl. Kopp schon hier?" Der kleine Junge sagte väterlich: "Dies hier ist doch nichts für Frl. Kopp". Ich begriff: Sie durfte die nackten Männer und Frauen nicht sehen. Ich war noch sehr salopp gekleidet, hatte ein offenes Hemd und die italienischen Sandalen an, die nur mit einem Riemen am Fuss gehalten sind. Während ich mit dem Lehrer, einem unbeschwerten jüngeren Mann, sprach, trat der Schulleiter, ein Ordensmann herein. Er hatte mönchische Tracht an, einen eckigen Schädel, und eine altmodische Brille, dazu ein polterige Art zu sprechen. Er war, das merkte man gleich, ein Mann von Charakter. Er zeigte auf meinen offenen Hemdkragen und sagte: "Das da ist sozusagen verboten. -- Die Sandalen sind gesetzlich erlaubt. - Man kann natürlich auch geschlossenere tragen". Damit wandte er sich zum Gehen, und ich sah, dass er genau solche Sandalen trug, nur in schwarzer Farbe, die zu seiner Ordenstracht gehörten. Das machte ihn mir sehr sympathisch. Er kehrte noch einmal um und unterhielt sich mit mir über Philosophie, anknüpfend an einen Neukantianer namens Wolf, der neulich hier einen Vortrag gehalten hatte. Ich sagte: "Meinen Sie Erik Wolf?" Er sah mich mitleidig lächelnd an. Er meinte einen Philosophen aus Königsberg. Dann fragte der Mann: "Warum sind Philosophen oft eitel? Die Philosophie müsste sie doch daran verhindern." Ich erwachte mit dem Gedanken, ihn zu sagen, dass ich von der Philosophie nicht verlangen würde, die Menschen besser zu machen, genauso wenig wie von der Theologie, deren Aufgabe das nicht sei. Hieran knüpften sich Gedanken über die Differenz der katholischen und evangelischen Rechtfertigungslehre. (443 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1775 (1957-01-18 - Freiburg)"Kommt doch her, helft mir doch, das Pferd beisst den Blinden", mit diesen Satz wachte ich aus einem längeren Traum auf. Ich wollte zusammen mit Emme den Direktor der pädagogischen Akademie, Dr. Schulze, besuchen. Er wohnte irgendwo draussen in einer Siedlung, doch nicht in der Mooswaldsiedlung wie früher, sondern in einer anderen. Der Strassenbahnschaffner wusste auch nicht ganz genau, wie man dahin kam. Zwei Strassenbahnlinien könnten hinführen -- aber beide endeten ungefähr in der selben Gegend. Ich solle doch aussteigen und fragen. Während der Weiterfahrt entdeckte ich zwischen den Holzrosten, die auf dem Boden der Bahn lagen, mehrere Eine-Marktstücke, die der Schaffner verloren hatte und schliesslich sogar ein Fünf-Mark-Stück. Ich sammelte sie alle und brachte sie ihm nach hinten auf die Plattform. Dann stiegen wir an der Endhaltestelle aus. Eine alte Frau, die wir fragten, kannte den Namen der Strasse (der mir entfallen ist) und sagte: "Ja, da wohnen neue Leute. Ich weiss noch gar nicht, was das für Leute sind, die das wohnen." Schliesslich waren wir bei Dr. Schulze. Wir unterhielten uns über den Juristen Böhmer, der in der Nähe wohnte. Ich glaube, eine Kakteensammlung war das Thema, da beide eine hatten. Emme erzählte, dass Böhmer trotz seines hohen Alters noch jeden Morgen einen Dauerlauf mache. Er ist ein origineller Kopf. Dann machten wir uns zu Fuss auf den Heimweg. Wir begegneten einem Blinden beiderseits Arm-amputierten Mann, der von einem anderen geführt wurde. Emme war neugierig, etwas von ihm zu erfahren und wir sprachen ihn an. Er war darüber nicht beleidigt, sondern eher erfreut. Seine beiden Armknochen waren nicht nur gespalten, um greifen zu können, wie bei manchen doppelt Armamputierten, sondern es waren ganz richtige Hände daraus geformt worden, die nun an der Stelle der Ellenbogen sassen. Er zeigte sie uns und sagte, "Meine neuen Hände sind gut durchblutet." Während des Gespräches führte ich ihn weiter und ging mit ihm über die Strasse. Drüben waren zwei berittene Polizeibeamte. Das Pferd des einen bockte. Ich wich darum mit dem Blinden zurück. Der Polizeibeamte war inzwischen abgestiegen, und das Pferd hatte sich losgerissen und kam direkt auf uns zu und näherte sich dem Blinden. Ich konnte erst nicht sehen, was es tat, weil er dazwischen stand, merkte aber daran, dass er so merkwürdig stillhielt, weil es eine seiner neuen Hände ins Maul genommen hatte. Niemand kam zur Hilfe. Ich rief entsetzt: "Kommt doch her, helft mir doch, das Pferd beisst den Blinden". Nichts rührte sich. Schliesslich schlug ich dem Pferd auf die Schnauze, in der Hoffnung, es würde dann loslassen. Doch nun biss es erst richtig zu. Der Blinde schrie auf. Ich erwachte. (432 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1777 (1957-02-14 - Freiburg)Ich sollte eine Vorlesung, wahrscheinlich eine Antrittsvorlesung, halten. Das Konzept hatte ich -- sozusagen im schöpferischen Rausch -- auf viele dreieckige Stoffstückchen geschrieben (der Form nach wie Schulterpolster, doch kleiner, nicht grösser etwa als eine Zigarettenschachtel). Eigentlich wollte ich dieses Konzept noch abschreiben. Aber ich hatte es immer aufgeschoben und nun stand der Termin unmittelbar bevor. Ich wollte wenigstens die Stoffstückchen, von denen ich einen ganzen Stapel beschrieben in der Tasche hatte, noch numerieren. Aber selbst dazu war ich nicht mehr gekommen. Hoffentlich würden mir die Stoffstückchen nicht durcheinander kommen. Ganz flüchtig hatte ich auch das Gefühl, die Zuhörer würden es vielleicht komisch finden, wenn ich diesen Stapel dreieckiger Stoffstückchen als Konzept herausziehen würde. Aber es schien mir wohl mehr zur akademischen Freiheit zu gehören. Während dieser Überlegungen stand ich irgendwo im Wandelgang der Universität. Ich hatte mir aus der Mensa noch etwas zu essen geholt und wollte den leeren Teller, den ich in der Hand hatte, noch vor Beginn der Vorlesung zurückbringen. Ich stieg also die Treppe rauf (die Mensa befand sich irgendwo in den oberen Stockwerken), doch da klingelte es schon. Ein bisschen zu spät kommen könnte ich schon, dachte ich, das ist ja bei Vorlesungen so üblich. Aber der Weg auf der Treppe war von vielen Herabkommenden verstopft, darunter ein ganzer Kindergarten. Als ich die Treppe schliesslich halb hoch geschafft hatte, merkte ich, dass es doch zu spät werden würde. Ich stellte den leeren Teller auf eine Fensterbank und eilte mich, um wieder nach unten und in den Hörsaal zu kommen. Die übermässig vollen Gänge vermied ich, indem ich einfach anders herum ging. Die Universität war nämlich im Carré angelegt, so dass auch der umgekehrte Weg zu dem Hörsaal führen musste. Hier waren die Gänge leer und ich kam schnell vorwärts. Den Rest des Traums erinnere ich nur dunkel, auf jeden Fall bin ich wohl aufgewacht in dem Moment, als ich die Tür zum Hörsaal öffnen wollte. Ich hatte immer noch Sorge, die Stoffstückchen meines Konzepts durcheinander zu bringen. Dann kommt mir noch das Wort pusillanimitas in den Kopf (Kleinmütigkeit). Meine Vorlesung schien also von der Affektenlehre Spinozas gehandelt zu haben. (354 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1778 (1957-02-19 - Freiburg)Wir wohnen in einer Art Strassenbahn. Ich stelle fest, dass vorne an der Plattform die Kanalisation undicht geworden ist und überfliesst und will mich beschweren. Ich steige dazu aus der Strassenbahn aus, und sehe den Schaffner, der gerade mit dieser abfährt. Ich rufe ihm meine Beschwerde zu und beginne einen geruhsamen Abendspaziergang. Ich wählte einen anderen Weg als sonst. Er führt mich in den Norden der Stadt. Mir schwebt ein Weg in das Glottertal vor, doch ist die Stadt des Traums anders als Freiburg. Ich komme zunächst durch eine Villengegend, während ich den schönen Abendhimmel beobachte. Dann auf eine Landstrasse, während es merklich dunkler wird. Nach einer Weile entdecke ich Bänke aus Holz am Strassenrand, an denen mir einleuchtet, dass sie aus dem Holz eines grossen Baums gemacht sein müssen, der ein Stück weiter vor einiger Zeit über die Strasse gefallen war. Hieran erkenne ich die Gegend wieder, und ich denke, dass muss ich Emme erzählen. Später gerate ich in ein Haus, in dem ein verrückter Mann wohnt, von dem ich plötzlich merke und weiss, dass er Emme dort versteckt hat. Ich beginne, sie überall im Zimmer zu suchen, während er höhnisch lächelnd in der Ecke steht. Alle Schränke öffne ich, in alle Winkel sehe ich. Schliesslich finde ich noch die Türen eines Eisschrankes. Ich habe irgendwie das Gefühl, in diese Richtung muss sie sein, obwohl der Eisschrank viel zu klein ist. Er ist auch leer, aber ich entdecke beim Öffnen, dass der ganze Eisschrank in eine Tür eingebaut ist, die zu einem hinteren Raum führt. Ich trete in ihn ein und beginne auch hier zu suchen. Der Mann folgt mir und geht weiter in einen dritten seitlichen Raum, wo er mit seiner Familie zu essen beginnt. Dieses Mahl im Hintergrund hat etwas Unheimliches. Ich habe das Gefühl, er könnte ein Kannibale sein. Plötzlich finde ich Emme in einem Kleiderschrank. Ich gehe ganz langsam und gemessen mit ihr heraus durch die beiden Räume ins Freie, so langsam und gelassen, dass die Aufmerksamkeit des Verrückten nicht erregt wird. Draussen Erwachen. (339 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1779 (1957-02-20 - Freiburg)Zunächst in einer englischen Landschaft, die mir alt vertraut erscheint. Hier kannte ich eine Kuppel am Horizont, dort eine Baumgruppe. Ich war hier schon oft gewesen und erzählte einem Begleiter (vielleicht Hf.) von dieser Vertrautheit. Dann entdeckte er plötzlich am Horizont die Türme des Strassburger Münsters. Im Weiterfahren (wir bewegten uns irgendwie fort) erschienen andere Statdsilhouetten, die zu dieser Landschaft gehörten. So glaubte ich einmal die Türme meiner Heimatstadt Schwerin zu entdecken. Doch als ich mich dem Dome näherte, merkte ich, dass es der einer anderen Stadt war. Der Turm gehörte zu zwei ganz kleinen alten Kirchen, von denen die eine mit der anderen durch eine Art Brückengang verbunden war. An der vorderen war der Turm angebaut, die hintere war eine alte, sehr alte Rundkirche. ich öffnete eine seitlich gelegene Tür zu dieser alten Rundkirche, nachdem ich vorher zwischen beiden und unter dem Brückengang hindurch gegangen war. Zu meinem Erstaunen erblickte ich in der Rundkirche ein viel grösseres längliches Kirchenschiff anstatt des runden Raums, den ich erwartet hatte. - Das uralte Gemäuer war merkwürdig weisslich geworden und wie wenn das Gestein sich aufgelöst hätte und teilweise aus der Form geflossen wäre (etwa wie geschmolznes Wachs oder wie Lava). Ich schloss die Tür und hörte noch beim letzten Blick in die Kirche, ohne doch etwas zu sehen, ein unheimliches Getrappel wie von vielen Füssen in der Kirche und warf die Tür zu. Das Getrappel schwoll zu lautem Geräusch an, doch ich konnte mich kaum fortbewegen. Alle meine Glieder waren wie gelähmt. Mühsam, gegen scheinbar ungeheure Widerstände und mit grosser Angst arbeitete ich mich auf dem Gang zwischen den beiden Kirchen und unter der Brücke hindurch vor. Schritt für Schritt wie gegen unsichtbare Stürme, während das Getrappel immer unheimlicher wurde und jeden Moment hinter mir her kommen konnte. Schliesslich hatte ich die Ecke erreicht. Hier ging es schon etwas leichter an der anderen Kirche entlang und dann kam ich um die nächste Ecke auf die Strasse und eilte erleichtert von dannen. (329 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1781 (1957-03-01 - Freiburg)Ich träumte, dass Max Müller mir etwas unangenehmes sagte (was, weiss ich nicht mehr) und war sehr unglücklich darüber. Dann wachte ich auf, weil die Tür aufging, und Max Müller kam mit strahlender Miene herein. Also hatte ich alles nur geträumt und war sehr froh. - Dann erwachte ich richtig.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1782 (1957-03-05 - Freiburg)Ich war aus Freiburg zurückgekehrt nach Göttingen. Doch war Gisela in Freiburg geblieben. (Der Traum spielt in der Zeit der Freundschaft mit Gisela, der ich von Göttingen nach Freiburg folgte). Das altvertraute Göttingen war nun nicht mehr so vertraut, weil Gisela nicht da war. Ich hatte Heimweh. Doch waren Ferber da, mein Bruder und Puschi. (Doch Ferber war in dem Traum noch nicht mit Puschi verheiratet, genau so wenig, wie ich im Traum verheiratet war - er spielte in einer ganz anderen früheren Zeit.) Ich hantierte in meiner Wohnung und erwartete Ferbers Besuch. (Diesen Traum träumte ich im Laufe des Morgens drei mal mit leichten Variationen. Es war aber immer die selbe Situation). Einmal wachte ich mit den Gefühl des Heimwehs nach Gisela auf und dieses Heimweh nahm ich wahr als einen Schrei ( - in Wirklichkeit einen Schrei, mit dem Billchen, die im Schlaf schrie, mich geweckt hatte - doch erschien im Erwachen beides noch identisch) Dieser dreifach wiederholte Traum mit der merkwürdigen Fremdartigkeit des Ortes und der Zeit beeindruckte mich sehr.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1783 (1957-03-11 - Freiburg)Zunächst in Wittmoldt. Dort hatten sie einen Tiger. Ich und andere hatten Angst vor ihm. Ein Mädchen war da, die ihn gross gezogen hatte. Sie hatte keine Angst vor ihm. Sie gefiel mir sehr gut. - Dann watete ich mit Feeli durch einen Sumpf - mit nackten Beinen. - Dann las ich Hf. aus Goethes gesammelten Werken einen Aufsatz von Goethe vor über die Etymologie des Wortes hf. Es wurde abgeleitet von at, es, etwas und bedeutete etwas wie ein Taschenmesser. Das war ein hf. Ich legte ihm ein Taschenmesser auf den Tisch und sagte, das ist ein hf. - Dann war Max Müller da und las in einem neuen Konversationslexikon unter dem Titel "Baby werde nicht alt". Das Buch war sehr nett aufgemacht. Bunter Umschlag mit dem Titel. Drinnen standen in vielen Spalten die Worte alphabetisch nebeneinander in verschiedenen Sprachen und nach verschiedenen Sachgebieten. Es war eine Art alphabetische Synopsis. - Unter Sch sah ich zum Beispiel Schelling. (159 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1784 (1957-03-12 - Freiburg)Ich konnte aus meinem Zimmer (wohl im Nikolausberger Weg in Göttingen) plötzlich in die Veranda des Hauses Im Goldgraben 18 blicken (wo ich früher gewohnt hatte). Ich sah Frau Kehr (die frühere Wirtin) dort auf und ab gehen und sich schliesslich auf einen Stuhl setzen. Ich war sehr merkwürdig von dieser Berührung mit der Vergangenheit angerührt. (56 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1785 (1957-03-13 - Freiburg)Erst im Theater. Ich hatte keine Karte und nur jemanden hinein begleitet. - Herr Diesselhorst, der gerade da sass, wo ich stand, ganz am Rande des arenaartig gebauten Raumes, meinte, ich solle doch während der Musik dableiben. (Es war ein Bühnenstück mit musikalischer Einleitung in moderner Musik.) Ich blieb da. Von der Bühne aus wurde mit Blitzlicht der Zuschauerraum photographiert. Ich versteckte mich zuerst. Doch wurde soviel photographiert, dass ich es dann aufgab. Dann erschien ein Mann mit Dirigentenstab auf der schwach beleuchteten Bühne. Er schrie etwas in den Zuschauerraum, was ich vergessen habe. Es handelte sich darum, dass man jenseits einer grossen Brücke (offenbar wie in Nagold), die hinter dem Theater anfing, etwas nicht tun sollte. Der Ton war ironisch. Szenenwechsel: Die Krebsbank zunächst noch auf der Bühne. Ich war Kassierer. Die ganze Krebsbank war bloss eine Art Tonne um mich herum. Herein kam ein Landstreicher sehr zerlumpt, zeigte einen Pass mit unendlich vielen Eintragungen und sagte: "ich hab schon mal gestohlen - ein Haus". Ich sagte "so", wunderte mich und beschloss, ihm keinen Kredit zu geben. Er aber sagte: "Ich will eine Stiftung machen für eine Ziege". - Erwachen. (191 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1786 (1957-03-17 - Freiburg)Traum von Hf.s Freundin Nanna. Zunächst sah ich einen merkwürdigen Unfall: einem Motorrad- oder Moped-fahrer sprang der Vorderreifen vom Rad. Er bewegte sich im Drall der Kreiselbewegung weiter, sprang in ein Bächle (die für Freiburg charakteristischen schmalen Wasserrinnen am Rande der Strasse). Das Bächle erweiterte sich zum Gewässer, in dem der Reifen mit grosser Geschwindigkeit schwamm. In dem Gewässer war auf Pfählen eine kleine Fabrik errichtet. Die Arbeiter beugten sich über den Steg, um ins Wasser zu langen und den Reifen zu greifen, der wie ein Phantom vorbeischwamm. Der ganze Vorgang hatte etwas geheimnisvoll gespenstisch Unweltliches. Die Geschwindigkeit des Reifens schien gleichsam unmessbar. Er verschwand unter Pfählen in dunklen unbekannten Gewässern. Dann wandte ich mich einem Kino zu, das am Rande der Strasse lag. Als ich in das Vestibül eintreten wollte, kam mir Hf.'s junge Freundin Nanna mit den langen blonden Haaren entgegen. Sie hatte bei sich ein gleichaltriges Schulmädchen, die aber noch sehr kindlich und nicht wie sie fraulich und erwachsen wirkte. Ich blieb in der Tür stehen und liess grüssend die beiden Mädchen in einer Handbewegung an mir vorbeigehen, so wie man jemand - schon in der Tür - noch den Vortritt lässt. Das junge Mädchen genierte sich, weil der Weg an mir vorbei sehr eng war, während Nanna freimütig vorbeitrat. Ich kehrte mit den beiden Mädchen um und begleitete sie ein Stück. - Als ich wieder allein war, sah ich den Mopedfahrer, der inzwischen, glaube ich, eine Frau geworden war, in Begleitung eines älteren etwas betont beamtlich angezogenen Herrn, der der Staatsanwalt war. Sie machte eine Bemerkung, dass ihr Unfall ja harmlos sei. Er sagte: "Das kann man noch garnicht wissen." Er schien ein Unheil dahinter zu widmen (Fehlleistung: so im Handschrift-Text geschrieben, statt wittern), irgend einen geheimnisvollen Anschlag, vielleicht einen Mord. (295 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1787 (1957-03-18 - Freiburg)Zu Besuch bei Dior. Ich war in Paris, um französisch zu lernen, und hatte bei Dior Quartier genommen, dessen Haus mir ausserordentlich gefiel. Am Abschluss eines Sprachlehrgangs mussten wir eine Rede auf französisch halten. Ich brachte - wobei ich die Worte noch sehr suchen musste - zum Ausdruck, dass Dior als Gestalt und sein Haus für mich der Ausdruck von Paris und Frankreich wäre. Ich erfuhr später, dass diese Rede am besten gefallen hatte. (74 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1788 (1957-04-26 - Freiburg)Zuerst in einer neuen Wohnung, doch diese war in einem ehemals protzigen Haus, das nicht wie das, in dem wir vorher wohnten, durch Kriegseinwirkungen ruiniert, sondern im Lauf der Zeit dreckig und fleckig geworden war. Das pompöse steinerne Treppenhaus war dreckig und muffig geworden, darauf folgte eine schmale Holztreppe, gesäumt von drückenden Ölgemälden in goldenen Rahmen. Auch die Zimmer selbst waren in einem verstaubten kalten und verblichenen Wohlstand eingerichtet, der niederdrückend wirkte. Um aufs Klo zu gehen, musste ich alle Treppen herunter in den Keller und wieder heraufsteigen, wobei ich Herrn Dorwarth (dem Maler und Gregors Schwager) begegnete, der mit seinen 6 Kindern auch dort wohnte. Ihn schien die Umgebung nicht so zu stören. - Ich sehnte mich in die alte Wohnung zurück, nach den aufgerissenen Decken im Treppenhaus, von denen der Gips herabhing, die gespenstig zwar, aber doch gemütlich war und unter dem Dach - und war sehr froh, als ich wirklich in dieser erwachte (156 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1789 (1957-04-26 - Freiburg)Dann anderer Traum. Besuch bei Bender: Er versuchte, meine Traumarbeit schlecht zu machen und nieder zu drücken. Auch hier war ich froh, als ich erwachte. (25 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1793 (1957-05-04 - Freiburg)Besuch mit Binswanger bei Binswanger. Er kam in dem Traum zweimal vor, ohne dass mir das überhaupt auffiel: ich wartete auf Binswanger, den Theoretiker, der Bücher geschrieben hatte und den ich hier in der S Stadt treffen wollte, um mit ihm zu Binswanger , dem Praktiker, nach Kreuzlingen zu fahren, der uns eingeladen hatte. Beide interessierten sich für meine Traumarbeit., Das traf sich gut. Ich konnte sie sich miteinander unterhalten lassen und brauchte nur zu zu hören. Dann aber fiel mir ein, dass mir Binswanger aus Kreuzlingen geschrieben hatte, ich solle ihm vielleicht Stücke aus meiner Arbeit vorlesen. ich stellte mir nun vor , wie es merkwürdig sein würde, wenn die beiden Herrn mir als dem sehr viel Jüngeren zuhören würden. Dass es aber bei beiden überhaupt um ein und dieselbe Persönlichkeit handelte, ging mir im Traum überhaupt . nicht auf. Erst als ich aufwachte, wurde mir das mit einem sehr merkwürdigen Gefühl langsam klar. (155 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1794 (1957-05-08 - Freiburg)Merkwürdige Träume: (Die Reihenfolge weiss ich nicht mehr ganz genau) 1) Ich fuhr mit Hf.s Freund Egbert in dessen alten Auto. Hf. war auch dabei. Egbert sass vorne am Steuer, ich hinter ihm. Dabei entwickelte sich folgendes merkwürdiges Phänomen: Immer wenn ich etwas dachte, noch ohne es auszusprechen, gab Egbert darauf die Antwort, als ob ich es laut gesagt hätte. So entwickelte sich ein ganzes Gespräch, von dem nur die eine Hälfte hörbar war. Es war ein merkwürdiger Fall von Telepathie. Ich sass schweigend da, und Egbert schien für den fremden Beobachter ziemlich unzusammenhängende Dinge zu reden. So wirkte es wohl auch auf Hf. Das Gespräch drehte sich wohl um Dinge aus Hf's Bekanntenkreis. Das weiss ich nicht mehr genau. (120 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1795 (1957-05-08 - Freiburg)Ich war in Benders Institut gekommen. Bender kam auf mich zu und sagte: "O wie gut, dass Sie gekommen sind, Sie können uns gerade helfen". Fräulein Strauch war bei der Sache, um die es ging, schon ganz müde geworden. Sie gab mir zwei Kopfhörer von einem Funkgerät, aus dem merkwürdige Worte tönten, von einer angenehmen Frauenstimme gesprochen. Es handelte sich um einen Code, zu dem Bender die Codetabelle in der Hand hatte. Neben den Deckworten standen die richtigen Worte, und Bender versuchte eilig, die mysteriösen Sprüche zu entziffern. Ich war etwas verwirrt von der ganzen Situation und konnte von Bender, der völlig in der Entschlüsselung des Codes aufging, nur erfahren, dass es sich um eine gute Sache handelte, vielleicht etwas ähnliches wie eine Widerstandsbewegung, auf jeden Fall Hilfe für andere Leute. Plötzlich tauchte ein Wort auf, das in der Codetabelle fehlte: das Jesuskind. - "Das Jesuskind, was bedeutet das - ich habe es vergessen", sagte Bender und auch Fräulein Strauch konnte sich nicht besinnen. Es spielte sich nun vor mir eine jener merkwürdigen Szenen ab, wo Menschen etwas, was sie ganz genau gewusst haben, nicht wieder in die Erinnerung bringen können, so viel sie sich auch bemühen. Es fiel ihnen nicht ein. - Hier brach die Szene, glaube ich, ab. In einer anderen Szene sah ich meinen Bruder im Vorraum des Instituts sitzen, während wir uns von Bender verabschiedeten. Bender sagte zu Fräulein Strauch, die Gisela hiess. "Gisela hat das grösste Interesse für Parapsychologie von allen". - Andere Szene: Bender war in unserer Wohnung und unterhielt sich mit Emme über eine Tagung in Chicago, der er beigewohnt hatte. Er meinte, das Anliegen der Tagung sei ein rein christliches gewesen - aber Emme wies aus dem Inhaltsverzeichnis eines grossen Buches nach, dass die Themen gar nicht christlich waren, sondern allerlei andere Dinge, wissenschaftlicher Art betrafen. Bender hatte über Parapsychologie referiert. (309 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1796 (1957-05-08 - Freiburg)Ich ging mit Anderen durch eine ungepflasterte Dorfstrasse. Eine riesige Spur im Boden, wie von einem ungeheuren Bären, erregte unsere Aufmerksamkeit. Es war, als wenn zwei riesige Tatzen oder Pranken mit Krallen in den Boden geschlagen hatten, wie von der Grösse eines Urwelttieres. Dann bemerkten wir, dass es die Spuren eines Baggers oder Krans waren, der in der Nähe stand. Dieses technische Ungeheuer war merkwürdig in der primitiven Dorfstrasse. - Wir waren dann auf dem Rückweg. Irgend ein beissendes Tier, ich glaube ein Pferd, verfolgte mich. Ich sprang in eine nur mannbreite Seitengasse, einen Verbindungsweg zwischen zwei Häusern, wo das Pferd nicht hinein konnte. Hier bedrohte mich ein kleiner chinesischer Hund, und auch die Bewohner waren bösartig. Ich konnte nicht auf die Strasse zurück, weil der kläffende Hund mir den Weg verstellte, d. h. er wurde von einem Mann gehalten und wollte mich in die Hände beissen. - Aber es gelang mir, rückwärts durch die Gasse ins freie Feld zu kommen und hier auf der Landstrasse meine Begleiter wieder zu treffen, die nicht von den Tieren bedroht worden waren. (179 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1797 (1957-05-11 - Freiburg)Ich bringe Emme zur Strassenbahn. Die Szene ist in Schwerin, doch als ob es in Freiburg wäre. Die Haltestelle ist in der Werderstrasse (Schwerin), so dass sie durch die ganze Stadt fahren müsste, um ans Ziel (mein Elternhaus in der Cäcilienallee) zu kommen. Wir küssen uns zur Verabschiedung. Ein Mann der in der Nähe steht, kuckt vergnüglich zu. Als die Bahn kommt, fällt mir ein, dass ich eigentlich ein ganzes Stück in die selbe Richtung muss, also gut ein Stück mitfahren könnte. So steigen wir beide ein, und die Bahn setzt sich in Bewegung. - Ich suche in meiner Tasche ein Fahrscheinheft und finde in meiner Tasche eines auf dem gerade noch eine Fahrt drauf ist. Ich gebe es dem Schaffner, sage "Umsteigen" (was für die Fahrt zum Elternhaus notwendig) und suche 40 Pfennig für einen weiteren Einzelfahrschein. Inzwischen zählt der Schaffner mechanisch Geld aus seiner Geldtrommel und gibt es mir in die Hand, als ob ich ihm eine grossen Geldschein gegeben hätte. Ich zähle es ebenso mechanisch nach. Es ist eine Riesenmenge Hartgeld, die gleichsam sturzbachartig aus seiner Geldtrommel herausgekommen ist, wie bei einem ganz seltenen Überfunktionieren eines Geldautomaten. Zur gleichen Zeit fällt ihm und mir auf: das ist ja viel zu viel, und dann erst begreifen wir, dass ja gar kein Geld rauszugeben war. - Szenenwechsel: Ich bin in Freiburg am Siegesdenkmal, um in Richtung Herdern (also zu Bender) zu fahren. Doch sind die Haltestellen so ausgelegt, dass die nach Osten führende westlich des Denkmals, die nach Westen führende östlich ist - also so, wie es am Bertholdsbrunnen, von dem aus ich nach Hause fahre, wirklich ist. (Beide Haltestellen, die zu Bender, und die nach Hause - im Freiburg - sind also verdichtet.) Die Bahn kommt, wird aber von einer Amateurin gefahren, keine gelernte Fahrerin. Ein Motorradfahrer, der eigentlich nach Haslach (also westlich) will, fährt trotzdem mit nach Herdern (also östlich) und sagt, er könne dann ja nachher mit zurückfahren. (322 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1798 (1957-05-13 - Freiburg)Ich war das andere Ich (aus dem Roman "Das fremde Ich" von Daphne du Maurier) - d.h. also der Engländer, der - eigentlich gegen seinen Willen - die Rolle eines französischen Grafen, Jean de Gue, spielen muss, dem er so ähnlich ist, dass niemand ihn als Falschen, als Doppelgänger erkennt. - Ich schaute aus einem Fenster des Schlosses und sah unten zu ebener Erde ein Baby herauskriechen und einen kleinen Löwen (wie das Steintier, das Emme "Löwle" nennt). Da wusste ich, dass der richtige Jean de Gue zurückgekommen war und ich also von meiner Rolle erlöst werden würde. Das Baby und das Löwle hingen damit zusammen. Ich musste so schnell wie möglich zu ihnen. Ich schätzte die Zahl der Stockwerke und die Lage der Zimmer ab. Es war drei Stockwerke tiefer und genau unter mir. Ich rannte zum Treppenhaus und rutschte auf dem Geländer herunter. Unten versuchte ich, die Stelle zu ermitteln, die vorher genau unter mir gewesen sein könnte. Leute von draussen riefen mir zu, sie hätten ein Baby vor dem Fenster kriechen sehen, aber jetzt sei es weg. Ich antwortete, es sei alles in Ordnung, um sie abzulenken. Dann lief ich durch den Kellergang - denn es war im Keller, und das Baby war durch die Gitterstäbe gekrochen gewesen. Ich öffnete schliesslich eine Tür, die meinem Gefühl nach etwa unter der Stelle sein musste, an der ich vorher drei Stockwerke höher gewesen war, und fand tatsächlich das Löwle und das Baby. Das Löwle war für meine Erlösung von der Doppelgängerrolle sehr wichtig. Es sah aus wie das Steinlöwle an der Perpetuakirche, mit etwas runzeligem Gesicht, ohne grosse Mähne und mit lockigem Fell an den Beinen und am Körper. Es war aber gleichzeitig irgendwie verzaubert, wie la bète in Cocteaus "La Belle et la Bète", und hatte wie diese ein Gewand, das es aber gar keine Lust hatte anzuziehen, es wollte lieber unbekleidetes Tier bleiben, das war irgendwie gemütlicher. Dann kam die Frau des Hauses, eine schwarze Französin, herein, die die Verhältnisse, also auch meine Doppelgängerrolle plötzlich auch zu durchschauen schien, und redete dem Löwle zu: "Willst Du nicht Dein Samtkleid mit Spitze anziehen?" Nur sehr langsam entschloss sich das Löwle dazu. -Ich erwachte hier wohl, denn von der Fortsetzung erinnere ich nichts. (374 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1799 (1957-05-16 - Freiburg)Ich sah Giselas Geige auf dem Tisch liegen. Jede Einzelheit war mir vertraut: das ziemlich dunkle Holz, die barocken Schwingungen, der Form. Ich wusste, wo sie repariert worden war, und sagte: " Es wird vielleicht kein Stück daran mehr das ursprüngliche Holz sein." Gisela selbst war nicht da - eine Frau zeigte die Geige, als ob es Giselas Frau sei - sie hatte die Rolle von Giselas Ehepartner, also von Peter - es war aber eine Frau - also wohl so, als ob Gisela ein Mann sei. Doch alle diese Überlegungen stellte ich im Traum garnicht an. (Es schien mir aber nach dem Erwachen auch so, als wenn diese Frau vielleicht "die andere Gisela" sei, die, die Peter heisst, verheiratet ist und nicht mehr mir gehört.) Ich hatte grosses Heimweh beim Anblick der Geige. - Dies war noch stärker in der nächsten Szene. Wir waren in einem alten Fabrikgebäude unmittelbar um das Haus, wo Gisela wohnte (so wie sie im Harburg im alten Schloss wirklich unmittelbar zwischen Werften und Fabriken wohnt, in die der Park unmittelbar übergeht). Wir sassen in einer er hallenartigen Umgebung hinter dem Haus. Gisela selbst war wieder nicht da, aber von jedem Stein, von jedem Fleck wusste ich ganz genau, dass er ihre Umgebung war, und hatte unendliches Heimweh. - Andere Szene: Wir hatten noch ein zweites Kind ausser Billchen, auch ein kleines Mädchen und nur wenig jünger als Billchen. Ich bemerkte plötzlich, dass ich mich um dieses Kind viel weniger gekümmert hatte als um Billchen. Es war stiller, sachlicher, kühler (hatte aber in Wirklichkeit auch Billchens Gesicht). Ich nahm es auf den Arm und küsste es. (271 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1800 (1957-05-21 - Freiburg)Erste Szene: Fräulein K. spielte im Benderschen Traumseminar ein Miniphon-(Tonband)-Protokoll von einem ihrer Träume vor, in dem etwas vom Apfelschälen vorkam. Ich sagte im Hinblick auf die Deutung zu ihr: "Schälen Sie sich?" - Zweite Szene: Ich hatte meine hebräische Bibel, die ich jemanden verliehen hatte, zurückgefordert. Als der Mann sie brachte, hatte ich gerade das andere Exemplar einer hebräischen Bibel, das ich noch hatte, hervorgezogen. Das war mir etwas peinlich, denn so konnte der Mann sehen, dass ich noch ein Exemplar hatte und das ihm geliehene nicht zurückzufordern brauchte. Aber ich wollte einfach meinen Besitz sammeln. In dem Buch waren allerhand Sachen eingeklebt, die der Mann während der Zeit seines Gebrauchs zugefügt hatte, anscheinend pietistische Sachen, oder so. Ich besah mit jemand das Buch, der frappiert war, als ich den Anfang hinten aufschlug. - Dritte Szene: Leute sind bei mir zu einem Fest eingeladen, einer Art Party. Jemand hat vorher eine Menge Wein gemischt und in die Badewanne gegossen. Als ich allein im Zimmer bin, steige ich ganz in Gedanken in die Badewanne, als ob Wasser statt Wein darin wäre. Da geht die Tür auf und Emme lässt eine Menge Gäste herein, die ich garnicht kenne. Es sind wohl Bekannte von Hf. Ich bitte sie, alle wieder hinauszugehen, was glaubhaft ist, da ich noch in der Badewanne sitze. Noch keiner hat gemerkt, dass in der Badewanne der Wein ist. Dann rufe ich Emme herein, um mit ihr zu beratschlagen, wie ich schnell den Wein aus der Wanne herauskriege, damit es niemand merkt, und erwache. (255 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1801 (1957-05-24 - Freiburg)Traum von Marion: Ich war mit Inge in Gummersbach, zuerst in einem Geschäftsgebäude, wohl der Bank ihres Vaters, dann zeigte sie mir das Haus von Marions Eltern. Es war ein kleines Häuschen in einer Art Siedlung. Ich ging durch einen langen Gartenweg hinein. Die Tür stand schon offen. Das Dienstmädchen wartete auf mich. Es war ein mittelaltes Mädchen, mit ganz besonders stark vergrössernden Brillengläsern, die keinen Rand hatten. Statt in die Augen kuckte man in diese merkwürdig stark gebogenen Brillengläser, die einen freundlich ansahen. Ich war verlegen, denn ich hatte Marions jetztigen Namen vergessen und kam darum ins Stottern: "Ich möchte fragen, ob vielleicht Frau - ach ich kann nicht auf den Namen kommen - Marion meine ich - ob die zufällig hier ist". - Das Mädchen antwortete in sehr ruhigem und selbstverständlichem Ton: "In einem Jahr" - der nächste Besuch schien schon ganz genau festgelegt zu sein - "und dann" -fuhr sie fort - "steht hier schon einer, der auf sie wartet, und hier, und hier und hier" - dabei um sich zeigend und überall gleichsam imaginäre Männer entstehen lassend. - Ich antwortete: "Ja, da, glaube ich - ein angemeldeter Besuch ist eben auch nicht das richtige. Vielleicht treffe ich sie in Heidelberg. - Wie ist denn eigentlich noch ihr jetztiger Name? Ich kann ihn nicht richtig behalten." Mir schwebte dabei ein Name wie Jansen vor. Das Mädchen antwortete "Jaser" (oder so ähnlich). Ich sagte: "Ach ja - merkwürdig, dass ich ihn vergessen habe, denn ich kenne sogar Herrn Jaser." Dann verabschiedete ich mich und erwachte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1802 (1957-05-24 - Freiburg)Und ich war wieder in Gummersbach bei Marions Eltern. Auf einer Wiese neben dem Haus tummelten sich viele kleine Kinder, alles Geschwister von Marion. Ich tanzte mit ihnen. Ein dicker fremder Bub mischte sich dazwischen, den ich erst loswerden musste. Marion selbst war irgendwie im Hintergrund der Szene. - Andere Szene - ich weiss nicht, ob ich zwischendurch noch einmal erwachte -: ich war nun doch über Nacht in Gummersbach geblieben und sollte wieder abreisen. Ich merkte das daran, dass mein Bett abgezogen war und ein Kursbuch darauf lag. Ich war traurig und konnte mich in dem Kursbuch nicht zurechtfinden. - Nach dem Erwachen lag ich noch eine Weile in einer Art Halbschlaf, der sich ab und zu zum richtigen Traum vertiefte, und war nun richtig mit Marion zusammen.

Wir tanzen in einer fliesenbelegten Küche. Sie hat ein Kleid an, das ihre Hüften freigibt, und meine Hände umschmiegen im Tanz ihre nackten Hüften. Sie tanzt federleicht, und ich spüre, dass sie mit nackten Füssen auf den Fliesen tanzt. - Zuvor hatten wir zusammen auf meinem Bett gelegen und ich hatte ihren Körper abgetastet. Als ich Schritte hörte, hatte ich zu ihr gesagt: "Komm, wir wollen aufhören, sonst wird meine Frau eifersüchtig". Darum waren wir aufgestanden und hatten zu tanzen angefangen. (112 words)

Bei einer dieser Figuren lockerten sich die Glieder. (56 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1806 (1957-06-04 - Freiburg)[Nachdem ich in Heideggers erste Vorlesung über den Satz der Identität kaum hereingekommen war, weil Fink die Aula absperren liess, die schon sehr voll war, obwohl viele der Aussenstehenden schon drinnen ihre Plätze belegt hatten, und ich mich sehr über dieses Verhalten Finks geärgert und mich gefragt hatte, ob es vielleicht von Heidegger veranlasst sei] träumte ich von einer Auseinandersetzung mit Heidegger. Ich kam mit dem Fahrrad in die Universität. Für Fahrräder war in der Halle vor der Aula ein Platz zum Abstellen der Fahrräder geschaffen. Ein alter Hausmeister (der, der am Tag zuvor die Aula abgesperrt hatte) stand davor. Ich sah Heidegger an der Tür der Aula, gerade im Begriff, in seine Vorlesung zu gehen, wie es schien, und stellte darum mein Rad nur an einen Stuhl, um noch rasch hinein zu kommen. Der Hausmeister war darüber empört. Heidegger der es hörte, kehrte um und sagte zu mir: "Was fällt ihnen eigentlich ein!"- Ich antwortete: "Ich verbitte mir diesen Tonfall, Herr Professor." - Heidegger erwiderte: "Ich werde Sie dem Rektor melden". Ich antwortete: "Das ist mir nur recht, Her Professor". Heidegger ging eilig zur Treppe, hielt dann aber inne, fasste sich an den Kopf und sagte: "Meine Sekretärin ist nicht da, ich kann die Sache nicht diktieren". - Erwachen noch sehr erregt von der Diskussion.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1807 (1957-06-04 - Freiburg)Eine oder zwei Nächte später träumte ich wieder, dass ich zu Heideggers Vorlesung gehen wollte. In einem Nebenraum der Aula, die hier aber mit der Räumlichkeit des Kinos "Die Kamera" identisch war (mit dem sie gemeinsam hat, dass sie zu klein und leicht überfüllt ist) sollte anschliessend ein Seminar stattfinden. - Ich wollte mir dort einen Platz belegen. Aber Heidegger, der vor der Tür sass, hielt mich zurück und sagte: "Die Plätze sind schon belegt" (oder etwas ähnliches). Ich war über diese Beschränkung der akademischen Freiheit empört (so wie ich in der Wirklichkeit über die Beschränkung der akademischen Freiheit empört war, die sich in der Absperrung eines Hörsaals ausdrückt. Fink hatte diese Absperrung durch seine Assistenten durchführen assen, die dabei wahre Ringkämpfe mit den empörten Einlass begehrenden Studenten ausgeführt hatten. Mich hatte dies alles sehr aufgeregt, weil es mir symptomatisch schien für eine Verbeamtung der Universität. Ich hatte auch schon gegen Fink von seinem Verhalten zu meiner Doktorarbeit einen Affekt.)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1811 (1957-06-10 - Freiburg)Ich hatte eine Tagung, oder Kongress, zu organisieren, konnte mich aber selbst in dem grossen Hotel nicht mehr zurechtfinden, in dem die Gäste untergebracht waren. Eine verwirrende Fülle von Treppenhäusern, kleinen und grossen barockartig angelegten, machte die Orientierung schwer. Es war schwer zu entscheiden, wo jeweils die Vorder- und Hinterseite des Gebäudes war, weil alles in sich gleichsam frontal und herrschaftlich angelegt war. Die Gäste waren gerade unten im grossen Saal eingetroffen. Diese Anfangsszene entwickele sich aus einem vorangehenden anderen Traumteil, in dem ich einen Film sah, der von einer Forschungstagung handelte. Er zeigte zuerst die Fahrt durch ein Gebirge wie den Schwarzwald und dann die Ankunft im Tagungsort, einer heiteren Barockstadt, deren viele heitere Türme gezeigt wurden. Hier begann die oben geschilderte Szene im Tagungssaal. Ich überlegte, dass ich die Gäste begrüssen wollte mit den Worten: "Willkommen in der heiteren Stadt". Zuvor empfing ich die, alle ebenfalls leichtgekleideten, Gäste in lässiger Kleidung mit Sandalen, im Windfang des Saales. Zwischen den Gästen kam ein grosser Hund, der Heiss gehörte. Er sprang mich an und legte sich mir - während ich stand - über den Kopf und bedrohte mich. Es blieb mir nichts anderes übrig, als still stehen zu bleiben und zu warten, bis Heiss kam und mir den Hund abnahm, da er allein mit ihm umgehen konnte. Danach verschwand ich durch eine Seitentür in die Küchenräume, um mich nun um die Vorbereitung zu kümmern. Es war eine Reihe von hintereinander geschalteten sehr modern eingerichteten Küchen. Ich suchte ein Klo und fand schliesslich eins. Dabei musste ich meine Unorientiertheit in dem Haus verbergen. Danach verirrte ich mich in den Treppenhäusern, die aber in ihren immer neuen Perspektiven etwas Faszinierendes hatten. Zuweilen erriet man beim Durchblick durch irgend einen Gang ihren Zusammenhang. Ich erwachte auf dem Rückweg zum Saal, wo ich die Gäste begrüssen wollte. (303 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1812 (1957-06-17 - Freiburg)Merkwürdiges Traumphänomen. Während heute Morgen Emme Billchen das Märchen vom Froschkönig erzählte, schlief ich noch einmal ein und hatte einen Traum, wobei ich aber das Märchen ohne Unterbrechung weiter hörte: Heidegger hielt ein Seminar über die Kritik der Urteilskraft (mit der ich mich in den letzten Tagen intensiv beschäftigt habe). Ich hatte die kleine Reclamausgabe in der Hand, in der ich immer lese (und die ich übrigens auch bei der letzten Heideggervorlesung bei mir hatte) und war auf dem Weg ins Seminar. Emme kam mit Billchen hinterher und erzählte ihr immer noch weiter das Märchen vom Froschkönig. Das Seminar fand in einem alten Gerichtsgebäude statt, das aussah wie das Colombischlösschen (wo übrigens Hf. sein juristisches Examen gemacht hat). Ich sah auf der Uhr an der Aussenwand des Gebäudes, dass es schon "Viertel nach" war. Ich musste also direkt in den Saal gehen und konnte nicht vorher noch eine Besorgung erledigen, für die ich allerlei Ballast mit mir schleppte, nämlich mehrere Mäntel. (Die Art der Besorgung habe ich vergessen). Ich sah Heidegger die Treppe rauf steigen und folgte ihm schnell. Direkt hinter mir kam Emme, die Billchen das Märchen vom Froschkönig erzählte. Das Märchen schien endlos zu sein. Heidegger verharrte noch etwas vor der Tür des Saales und machte sich in einem Nebenraum zu schaffen, während ich die Kleider und meine vielen Mäntel aufhängte und auf Stühle legte und Emme Billchen gerade den Schluss des Märchens erzählte. Als ich den Saal betreten wollte, wachte ich auf und hörte gerade noch, wie Emme (in Wirklichkeit, im Wachen) die Schlussformel des Märchens sagte und von Billchen ergänzen liess: "Und wenn sie nicht gestorben sind ... dann leben sie heute noch."

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1813 (1957-06-20 - Freiburg)Träume von schwangeren Frauen. Ich kam zuerst durch eine unbekannte Gegend im Vorfeld der Stadt, die sich (in Richtung Osten) weit erstreckte (weiter als in Wirklichkeit). Ich ging durch eine Gasse mit kleinen Häusern, die plötzlich endete, und kam in einen Laden, in dem ich aber schon mal gewesen war, weswegen ich irgendwie wusste, dass von ihm ein Durchgang zu weiterführenden Strassen möglich war. Die Ladeninhaberin, die mich wohl noch kannte, zeigte mir auch einen solchen Durchgang, der durch einen Hausflur und Hinterräume des Ladens auf eine andere Strasse führte. Auch hier war die Umgebung - wie in dem Laden - noch dörflich. In einem Haus sah ich in der Haustür eine fast nackte schwangere Frau. Sie hatte nur ein goldenes sehr kleines Bikinhöschen an und einen ebensolchen Büstenhalter um die Brüste. Sie war sehr schön und voll glühender Leidenschaft. Sie kam auf mich zu und wir umarmten uns. Es war eine elementare Begegnung. - Später stieg ich in eine Strassenbahn, deren Linie mir auch schon dunkel bekannt war. Ich wusste, dass sie irgendwie in Schlangenlinien in die Gegend meiner Wohnung führte, wobei sie mehrfach die gerade Ostwest-Linie, die aber nicht so weit ausserhalb der Stadt begann, kreuzte. Ich vertraute mich also dieser anderen kurvenreichen Linie an. In einer anderen Szene ging ich ausserhalb der Stadt spazieren. Ich traf Gesine und war dann mit ihr in ihrem Haus, wo auch ihr Man und andere Bekannte waren. Sie war schwanger und dabei sehr schön und in jener elementaren, ganz leiblichen Verfassung, in der oft schwangere Frauen sind. Sie stand irgendwie etwas unsicher auf den Beinen und machte darum einige unsicher Schritte und suchte in meinen Armen Halt. So kam es zu einer ganz kurzen Berührung und Umarmung, wobei mir ihr leidenschaftliches Gesicht mit gelösten Haaren ganz nahe kam. Ich ging dann wieder fort und wollte an der Tür in meine Sandalen steigen, denn ich war barfuss hineingegangen, stieg aber zuerst aus Versehen in fremde aber ganz ähnliche Sandalen, die wie die meinen nur mit einem Riemen über den Zehen gehalten wurden - Als ich Gesine zuerst sah, war mir übrigens eingefallen, dass ich gerade von ihr und ihren Vater, dem Theologen Bultmann geträumt hatte, und ich sagte ihr dies. Sie erwiderte drauf, dass sie auch gerade von uns geträumt hätte. (379 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1814 (1957-06-21 - Freiburg)Ich bin in Heideggers Vorlesung über den Satz der Identität. Heidegger beginnt die Vorlesung damit, dass er sagt: "Ich habe hier eine Karte vorliegen, gezeichnet v. Uslar..." Ich wundere mich, welcher Uslar das gewesen sein muss, da ich keinen kenne, der es mit Philosophie zu tun hat. - Währendem fährt Heidegger in seinem Satz fort: ".. darauf sind wunderbare Sätze von Schelling über die Identität zusammen geschrieben." Jetzt begreife ich plötzlich, dass es ja die Karte sein muss, die ich selbst mit Schellingzitaten über die Identität an Heidegger geschickt habe. Heidegger fährt nun fort, wobei er so leise spricht, dass ich beide Hände vor die Ohrmuschel halten muss, um ihn zu verstehen. Er tadelt zunächst die anscheinend wahllose Zusammenstellung dieser Sätze und tut, als wenn er die Sache damit abtun wolle, geht dann aber sehr eingehend auf diese Sätze ein, wobei er sie mit der Theologie in Zusammenhang bringt. Ich höre angespannt zu und versuche mir seien Stellungnahme einzuprägen. (Auch nach dem Erwachen versuche ich noch, Heideggers Sätze genau zu behalten. Es gelingt mir aber nicht, sie ins volle Wachen hinüberzuretten, so dass ich nur die Anspielung auf den Zusammenhang mit der Theologie behalten habe). (195 words)

Es hiess zwar Jugendheim, war aber ein vornehmes Sanatorium (ähnlich eingerichtet wie Binswangers Sanatorium Bellevue in Kreuzlingen). Die kleine Stadt war auch ganz in der Nähe von Kreuzlingen - eigentlich zwischen Konstanz und Kreuzlingen am Seeufer - so klein war sie. Ich wusste nicht recht, was ich in dem Sanatorium anfangen sollte. Ich hatte dauernd das Gefühl, irgend etwas falsch zu machen. Es war sehr heiss und alle Leute wenig bekleidet. Einmal hatte ich nur ein Hemd an - aber dies schien mir doch zu wenig. Später traf ich an einem Tisch lauter Journalisten, die sich mit der merkwürdigen Aufteilung der Stadt in viele Herzogtümer beschäftigten, die eben erst durchgeführt war. Ich sagte, ich sei gerade in der Stadt gewesen (diese Szene spielte also wo anders, obwohl wie uns nachher wieder im Sanatorium zu Tisch setzten). Ich sagte, die Leute in der Stadt hätten sich wenig um die Aufteilung gekümmert. Die Journalisten wollten das sofort aufschreiben. Ich antwortete, dass ich aber nur die Leute im Sanatorium kenne und dies nur mein Eindruck sei. Die Journalisten lachten über diese skrupulöse Einschränkung. (214 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1821 (1957-07-19 - Freiburg)Während ich mit Fräulein Strauch in einer mir weniger bekannten Stadtgegend unterwegs war, traf ich in einem Fenster sitzend eine kleine gelbgefleckte Katze, die früher bei uns (Emme und mir) gewesen war. Es war ein junges Kätzchen, das umherstreunte und jetzt bei einer tierliebenden Frau eingekehrt war, die es fütterte. Später kamen wir noch mal in die siedlungsartige Strasse. Jetzt fand ich die Katze auf einem Busch, der ganz und gar mit Baldrian bewachsen war und in der Mitte mit einem Büschel Thymian. Die geniesserische Katze hatte sich also diesen Busch ausgesucht, weil Katzen Baldrian so gern mögen (Übrigens sah der Baldrian, der auf dem Busch wuchs wie etwa Mistel oder Efeu, worüber ich mich nicht wunderte, nicht so aus wie richtiger Baldrian, sondern eher wie Majoran, was mir aber im Traum garnicht auffiel). Fräulein Strauch war, während ich an dem Busch stand, weiter in die Strasse gegangen, wo sie etwas zu erledigen hatte. Als sie fertig war, erzählte ich ihr von der Beschaffenheit des Katzenstrauches, und wir traten dann durch ein Tor oder eine Einfahrt auf eine belebte Strasse heraus. Ich wollte mich nach rechts wenden, weil ich glaubte, dass wir in Freiburg seien, wo dies die richtige Richtung gewesen wäre. Sie fasste mich aber am Arm und zeigte nach links, wo der Kölner Dom zu sehen war. Wir waren also in Köln, und hier wäre der Weg zum Stadtzentrum, den wir gehen mussten, nach links. Ich musste über meine Verwechslung lachen. Der Dom, den wir sahen, war übrigens noch nicht der richtige, sondern ein neugotischer Vordom, eine vorstädtische Imitation des richtigen. - Szenenwechsel: Ich kam - jetzt in männlicher Begleitung - im den Wartesaal des Bahnhofes. Wir bestellten etwas zu essen. Andere Szene: Jetzt war es ein Saal mit einer Kapelle. Ein leitender Mann, mit einer Ziehharmonika - vorher hatte er, glaube ich, eine Trommel. Die anderen hatten alle Hörner. Ich hatte auch ein Horn, konnte aber anscheinend nicht richtig blasen. Jedenfalls wurde ich dafür getadelt. (328 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1822 (1957-07-23 - Freiburg)Spaziergang auf dem Schönberg (aus der Richtung vom Jesuitenschlössle aufsteigend, das aber im Traum nicht weiter gegeben war). Am Waldrand war ich unschlüssig, ob ich mich nach rechts an den Nordhang wenden sollte (ein Weg, den ich schon mal mit Emme gegangen war - auf diesem Spaziergang aber war ich allein), oder ob ich geradeaus einen Weg gehen sollte, der zum Südhang führen musste. Zwei Studenten, die vor mir gegangen waren und sich über Ontologie unterhalten hatten, schienen ebenso unschlüssig. Ich entschloss mich für den Weg zum Südhang, der zunächst mitten in den Wald führte, und sah, dass mir die beiden Studenten hierin folgten. Nach einer Weile - früher, als ich gedacht hatte - öffnete sich der Wald. Statt eines Hanges, der vor mir - wie im Norden des Berges - abgefallen wäre, breitete sich vor mir, in der selben Höhe wie der Waldrand, eine Hochebene, die hinten terrassenförmig erhöht war. Es war ein überwältigender fremdartiger Eindruck, wo man den Abfall zu einem tiefen Tal erwartet hatte, die Höhe mit einem grossen Plateau ausgefüllt zu sehen. Ich wandte mich nun rechts herum und ging am Waldrand unterhalb der Kuppe des Berges entlang, der nur um den Kopf herum bewaldet ist. Ich erinnerte mich, dass Emme schon mal von einer Hochebene gesprochen hatte, die im Süden des Berges läge. Ich überlegte nun, dass der Weg, dem ich jetzt folgte, zum Schönberg-Gasthaus führen musste, wo wir unseren Urlaub verbringen wollten. Ich dachte, dass es nichts schaden könnte, wenn ich schon einmal dorthin ginge, obwohl ich auf diesem Spaziergang - wie sonst nie - allein war, um dort die Möglichkeiten zu sondieren. Der Weg am Südrand war belebter und kultivierter als der rauhe Weg am Nordhang (den wir den Löcherstein-Weg genannt hatten). Verschiedene Menschen begegneten mir. - Steinplatten führten zu einer Aussichtsplattform hinauf - aber ich erstieg sie nicht, weil es geregnet hatte und sie noch so feucht waren, dass man abgerutscht und abgestürzt wäre. Der Weg wurde immer kultivierter. Plötzlich wich rechts der Wald zurück und der Blick erschloss sich auf ein wunderbares Gebäude. auf dem nicht bewaldeten Teil westlich des Schönbergkopfes. Ich dachte erst, es wäre eine Burg, um die sich ein altes Dorf zu scharen schien. Dies alles musste unterhalb (südlich) des Schönberggasthofes liegen (Hier folgt im handschriftlichen Text eine Skizze mit dem Schönbergkopf und der Erläuterung: "Bewaldeter Kopf", Darunter auf der Nordseite: "Jesuitenschlösschen, Nordhang, Nordweg", und darüber auf der Südseite: "Südrand, Hochebene", und schliesslich rechts, was hier dem Westen entspricht: "Burgkirche" und "Gasthaus".) Bei näherem Zusehen entdeckte ich, dass es eine Kirche mit farbigen Säulenhallen war, die wohl zu der Burg gehörte. Das Bauwerk war wunderschön und phantastisch. Es lag inmitten eines Friedhofes, der bis an den Weg, den ich ging, heranreichte. Ich trat, um die Kirche, ungehindert von der Friedhofsmauer, sehen zu können, in das Friedhofstor und betrachtete sie gendankenverloren. Plötzlich trat ein grosser schwarzer Hund zu mir. Ich hörte den Ruf eines Mannes und sah aufblickend einen Blinden auf dem Weg stehen, der noch einen zweiten, ebenfalls schwarzen und grossen Hund bei sich hatte und den anderen, zu mir getretenen wieder zu sich rief mit den Worten "Swolke, komm!" - Doch der Hund ging nicht, was mich wunderte, da Blindenhunde doch so gehorsam sind, sondern im Gegenteil: er legte seinen Kopf ganz dicht an den meinen, so dass seine Augen direkt neben meinen Augen waren. Da wurde mir klar, wodurch der Hund so reagierte. Ich hatte in der Betrachtung und Meditation über die phantomhaft wunderbare Kirche zeitweilig die Augen geschlossen, so auch gerade eben wieder - und das war für den Hund wie ein Schema -: er sah in mir den Blinden und musste seinem Treib, mir beizustehen, gehorchen, entgegen dem Befehl, den er hörte. Ich erklärte dies dem wirklich Blinden, und er sah den Zusammenhang sofort ein, er schien ihm ganz natürlich. Ich liess die Augen offen und der Hund folge nun dem Befehl seines Herrn. (650 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1823 (1957-07-24 - Freiburg)Ein Sonderzug Heideggers fuhr gerade ein. Aus dem Lautsprecher wurde angekündigt: "Der Sonderzug soll sofort zurück nach Celle fahren" und in eindringlichen Tönen an Heidegger gerichtet, als der Zug sich nicht sofort rückwärts in Bewegung setzt: "Fahren Sie sofort zurück, seien Sie doch vernünftig!". Ich las die Worte zugleich in einem Anschlag. Ein anderer Reisender erklärte uns den Grund: Es war ein Überfall auf Heidegger geplant. Bewaffnete Leute waren im Wald versteckt, die ihn mit Keulen erschlagen wollten. Mir war der Gedanke sehr ungemütlich, dass ich selbst gleich die selbe Strecke fahren musste. Zwar war ich froh, dass es kein Sprengstoffattentat war, aber wer konnte wissen, ob die Keulenmänner Heidegger genau kennen würden und nicht stattdessen einen anderen, z.B. mich erschlagen.

Das waren Bestimmungen aus seinem Vertrag, auf deren Einhaltung man im Hotel achten sollte.

Die Verkäuferin machte mich auf ein Plakat aufmerksam, auf dem wunderschöne Brillanten und Edelsteine in modernen aber elementar schönen Fassungen abgebildet waren. Es waren lauter einzelne Stücke von erlesenem Geschmack. Sie hatten alle einer Frau namens Joan Crawford gehört, die sie und ihr Mann alle dem Juwelier namens Balancegna zurückgeschickt hatten, weil sie kein Geld mehr hatten, ihre Schulden zu bezahlen Wir bewunderten diese Charakterstärke, da sie sich schon an der spanisch-potugiesischen Küste befunden hatten und mit dem wunderbaren Schmuck hätten fort fahren können. Sie hatte eine ganz ebenmässig gebaute, leicht gewölbte Stirn und leuchtend braune Augen. Sie war kleiner als ich und unter ihrem braunen Kittel konnte ich in Gedanken ihren ganzen Körper erfassen. Wir liebten uns und waren so ineinander versunken, dass ich ganz vergass, Schuhe zu kaufen. Wir sassen schon vorne mit dem noch jungen Ladeninhaber auf einer Bank, als es uns wieder einfiel. - Wir gingen nach hinten in den Laden und waren beide etwas verwirrt. Ich ergriff ein paar Mokassins und das Mädchen meinte, diese würden mir gut stehen. Sie sassen meinem Fuss wie angegossen und waren mit feinen goldenen Linien über dem Fuss kreuzweis verziert - wie Indianer-Mokassins. Sie sahen in der Tat recht nett aus. Dann gingen wir wieder nach vorne und aus dem Laden raus - ich weiss nicht mehr, wohin, ob in ein Lokal -, auf jeden Fall wollte ich das Mädchen lieben, dessen Gestalt sich tief in meine Vorstellung eingegraben hatte. In der nächsten Szene wurde aus dem Mädchen Bambi. Ich küsste sie in ihren Bett und nahm sie in meine Arme. Sie war nackt und sehr schmal. Ich spürte, dass sie bei der Schulter eine Narbe im Rücken hatte. Ihre Augen waren gross und abwartend. Ich war befangen, auch weil Hf. In der Nähe war. Danach schlich ich mich vorsichtig in mein Zimmer zurück, um Hf. nicht aufmerksam zu machen. (314 words)

Alle glaubten, dass sie noch nicht da sei. Nur ein älteres Faktotum des Hauses glaubte fest, dass sie schon da sei, und suchte sie überall. Sie fand sie schliesslich auch fest schlafend in ihrem Schlafzimmer (das der Lage nach dem Schlafzimmer meiner Eltern im Elternhaus entsprach, während der Essraum dem Jungenszimmer). Das Mädchen hatte keine Ahnung von dem Betrieb des Instituts und war einfach in tiefen Schlaf verfallen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1828 (1957-08-02 - Freiburg)Zuerst schrieb ich eine Art Abhandlung, die aus philosophischen und allgemeinen Prinzipien ableitend vorging. Diese gab ich Bender zu lesen, der lächelnd sagte: "Sie haben den lunaren und den maritimen Charakter beschrieben" (oder sagte er neptunischen?) Ich antwortete: "Ja, das habe ich auch schon gemerkt". Mir hatte es übrigens geschienen, als hätte ich den lunaren und den solaren Charakter beschrieben. Der Sinn dieser Typen und ihr Zusammenhang mit allgemeinen Prinzipien war mir im Traum klar, obwohl ich jetzt nichts mehr davon erinnere. Dann war Fräulein Strauch da, die von einer Reise zurückgekommen war. Sie war ganz schwarz gekleidet. Wir warteten auf eine Strassenbahn. Dann kam diese. Eine frühere Bekannte von Fräulein Strauch stand noch an der Haltestelle, stieg aber nicht mit ein. Sie lief auf den noch leeren Anhänger zu und stieg erfreut ein. Ich folgte ihr, und während ich noch meinen Weg durch die Bahn suchte, setzt sich diese in Bewegung. - Die eine Seitenwand der Bahn fehlte, und man war durch die Fliehkraft dauernd in Gefahr, herausgeschleudert zu werden.

Die Kirche des Ortes spiegelt sich wunderbar im See, der die Umrisse leicht vereitert. Ich sehe diesen vertrauten Anblick wie zum ersten mal. Dann begegnet mir Heidegger und sagt: "Na, gehen Sie auch heut Abend in das Seminar von Erik Wolf?" Bald darauf, ich will gerade den kleinen Berg ersteigen, auf dem viele schöne alte Bauten sind, begegnet mir Wolf selber. Er kehrt um und beginnt ein Gespräch, in dessen Verlauf er sagt: "Haben Sie heute Abend um neun Zeit? Dann können Sie in mein Seminar kommen." Dann erzählt er einiges über südamerikanische Bücher, die er gelesen hat. Eines ist von dem Sanct, wie er sagt, das sei ein Sohn von Husserl. Dieser nenne den Namen Husserl nicht, aber in Wirklichkeit zitiere er ihn dauernd. Ich kaue während des Gesprächs auf einer Salmiakpastille, die ich vorher in den Mund gesteckt habe. Das ist mir etwas peinlich. Ich hatte sie in der Tasche des Mantels gefunden, als ich gerade traurig war, und mich darüber gefreut.

Wir kamen auf das Verhältnis von Traum und Schlaf, und es entstand die Frage, ob man die Zusammengehörigkeit der beiden überhaupt beweisen könne. Ich sagte: "Wie merkwürdig ist es, dass wir diese Zusammengehörigkeit alle annehmen." Jemand wendete ein, ob ich denn irgendwie wüsste, womit man die Zusammengehörigkeit beweisen könnte. Ich sagte: Ja, wenn man im Traum träumen könnte, dass man schliefe - und dies sei mir schon passiert- ich hätte diese innige Beziehung von Traum und Schlaf schon erlebt. Erwachen mit dem noch lange anhaltenden Gefühl, dass es sich hier um sehr bedeutsame Verhältnisse handelte. Ich hatte also praktisch im Traum darüber diskutiert, ob man im Traum träumen könne, zu schlafen. Dies sollte die Zusammengehörigkeit von Traum und Schlaf beweisen.

Es ging um einen Autor namens Stewey (gesprochen Stué), der über den Traum geschrieben hatte. Ich sagte: "Der Traum sagt ganz einfach: Das ist ein Haus, das ist ein Baum, das ist ein Baby..." (Die Fortsetzung des Satzes habe ich nicht mehr wörtlich behalten, ihr Sinn war etwa:) Für uns ist das etwas "Zukünftiges" oder Bedeutendes. (Dass das Wort "Zukünftiges" vorkam, weiss ich noch. Das andere schwebt mir nur dem Sinn nach vor). Dieser Gedanke war in dem Gespräch mehrfach variiert (Es handelt sich um den Gedanken meiner Arbeit, dass das, was im Traum einfach Sein und Anwesenheit ist, für uns erst hinterher etwas eigentlich Zukünftiges oder Gewesenes, oder etwas Bedeutendes wird). Hier brach die Niederschrift ab mit einer Bemerkung in Frau Böhringers Handschrift (die also das Protokoll geschrieben hatte): "Die übrigen Nachsätze sind für Stewey etwas zu eng-augenblicklich". Ich ärgerte mich über dieses eigenwillige Urteil von Frau Böhringer, da ich gerade diese Sätze gern nachgelesen hätte, die vielleicht am wichtigsten waren - und warf das Buch mit dem Protokoll wütend in die Ecke. Dann stand ich auf, holte es wieder, legte es auf den Tisch und beschloss, fort zu gehen. Im Fortgehen sah ich Frau Böhringer noch im Morgenrock die Treppe runter kommen und danach Bender, der sich gerade anzog. Er hatte erst eine Hose an und noch einen nackten Oberkörper. Er zog sich im Treppe-Runtergehen das Hemd an, während er schon mit mir redete und blieb dann vor mir stehen. Er war gerade unmittelbar vor der Abreise. Ich sagte, ich sei nur spaziergangs-weise vorbeigekommen und wolle ihn garnicht stören. Er sagte noch schnell etwas über eine Aufgabe, irgend eine Befragung, die er mir zugedacht hatte. Währenddessen zog er sich seinen Pullover an. Ich dachte, ob er wohl weiter redet, während der Pullover vor seinem Gesicht ist. Er tat es. Seine Worte tönten aus dem grauen Stoff heraus. - Im Begriffe der Verabschiedung erwachte ich. (364 words)

Er sagte: Die Relativität der Geschwindigkeit (gemeint war die Relativitätstheorie) kann man am besten in Bayern studieren. Da kann man nebenher gehen (gedacht offenbar, wie wenn man neben einem Zug hergeht). Dann Gespräch über etwas, worüber Bender geschrieben hatte. Er tadelte Benders Referat dieser naturwissenschaftlichen Sache. Es ging dabei um eine Verwechslung. Bender hatte das Wort "wägen" statt eines anderen, mit Zahlen zu tun habenden Wortes verwendet, in dem statt des ä ein e stand. (80 words)

Ich überlegte, ob er jetzt nicht wieder wild werden und beissen würde. Aber er war ganz zahm. Dann war da eine ganze Strassenbahn voll Tiere (die auch zu Emme in Beziehung standen). Schliesslich etwas von zwei Köpfen, die irgendwie aus Band gewickelt wurden - aber zu ein und demselben lebenden Wesen gehörten. Das war eine Schwierigkeit. Man hätte einen daraus machen müssen - aber das ging nicht, dann hätte man den grossen Kopf um den kleinen gewickelt, dann hätte der grosse anstatt des Hohlraums der Speiseröhre eine kleinen Kopf gehabt, und das geht nicht.

Auch Herrn v. Bredows Wappen war dabei. Es war sehr kompliziert. -Dann ein Brief von einer Möbelfirma. Die Möbel sollte man bei Herrn Tugendhat sehen können (Name eines Freiburger Philosopohiestudenten, den ich bei Heidegger kennen lernte). Andere vergessen. In einer anderen Traumszene hatte ich mich (wohl für ein Spiel) als Mädchen verkleidet, hatte ein Tuch um den Kopf und lange wallende Haare. Das Wesen, das mir aus dem Spiegel entgegen blickte, war ganz reizend und charmant, mit leuchtend Augen und kokettierte. Ich bedauerte es, nicht immer eine Frau zu sein und diese Möglichkeiten auskosten zu können. - Die genaue Reihenfolge der Szenen ist mir nicht klar (142 words)

Das ganze Treffen war in einem Lokal. Vorher war ich durch die Strasse hinter ihr her gegangen. Sie hatte einen sehr schnellen Schritt. Wir hatten uns fast verfehlt. - In der Schlossbergstrasse war die Strasse mit einem wunderschönen gotischen Gewölbe überwölbt, das ich nie vorher so gesehen hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1843 (1957-10-12 - Freiburg)Seminar mit Heiss. Er sagte im Verlauf eines Satzes: "die Identität der Krise". Ich musste lächeln. Er fragte mich: "Warum lachen Sie?" Ich antwortete: "Ich lache nicht, ich lächle nur, weil Sie gesagt haben: Die Identität der Krise." Er erwiderte: "Ich habe absichtlich diesen sinnlosen Ausdruck benutzt, um zu sehn, ob es überhaupt bemerkt wird." Ich antwortete etwas, dass es mir garnicht so sinnlos schiene. Mir schwebte dabei vor, dass die Krisis (etwa in dem Sinn, wie Schelling sie meint) für Heiss irgendwie charakteristisch sei. - Dann fuhren wir im Auto. Ich fuhr in einem kleinen Auto von Spielzeuggrösse hinter Heiss her. Die Szene verwandelte sich hier insofern, als an die Stelle von Heiss eine andere Figur trat - irgend ein Arzt. Wir fuhren in einen Hotelpark ein, Ich folgte mit meinem kleinen Auto einem Gartenweg, der mich in Spiralen, unheimlichen Linien, an einen Hintereingang des Hause führte. Man sagte mir, dass ich gerade den richtigen Eingang getroffen habe. Es war eine Irrenanstalt, und ich war dort zu Besuch wie bei Binswanger. Nur war die Einrichtung noch eleganter als in Kreuzlingen, was ich nicht erwartet hatte. Ich erwachte in dem Moment, als ich die Tür zu meinem Zimmer öffnen wollte. (200 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1844 (1957-11-05 - Freiburg)Von den Einzelheiten hatte ich schon gleich nach den Erwachen sehr viel vergessen. Der Traum schien mir aber sehr interessant, weil in einem sehr komplizierten Verhältnis verschiedene Personen in ihm abwechselnd männlich und weiblich zu sein schienen, sich aber am Schluss - die Handlung war da wie in einem Film - herausstellte, dass sie dieses nur gespielt hatten. Zunächst fuhren wir - Emme und ich - in einem Ozeandampfer. Wir kamen dann auf einem Bahnhof in Amerika an. Die ganze Reise scheint gleichzeitig auch eine Eisenbahnreise gewesen zu sein. Schon auf dem Bahnsteig fiel mir auf, dass dort Frauen nur im Bikini bekleidet herum liefen. Dann öffnete sich von einer Stelle des Bahnsteigs plötzlich ein Blick auf einen herrlichen gelben Badestrand, auf dem sich sehr schöne Frauen sonnten, und auf das tiefblaue, von mächtigen Wellen bewegte Meer, den atlantischen Ozean. Auch auf der anderen Seite des Bahnsteigs sah man das wild bewegte Meer. Der Bahnhof lag also auf einer Landzunge oder Felsnase. Ich sagte zu Emme, dass wir hier zum ersten mal direkt den Atlantischen Ozean sähen. Bei der wilden Bewegtheit der riesigen Wogen hatte ich ein unheimliches Gefühl in dem Gedanken, dass wir darüber gefahren seien. In einem reizvollen Gegensatz dazu stand das unbeschwerte Leben der wenig bekleideten sehr erotischen Frauen am Strande und auf dem Bahnhof. Ich erfuhr, dass der Ort Las Vegas sei, und mir fielen dazu (im Traum) die Worte "Viva las Vegas" (ein Filmtitel) ein, die mich wegen ihres schönen Klanges faszinierten und das ungezwungene Leben zu erklären schienen. Unter den Frauen war eine namens Eve, der ich ihren Namen auf die nackten Beine schrieb, und zwar direkt in die Leistenbeuge, dort, wo die Beine in den Leib übergehen und wo der Rand ihres Höschens begann. Die Buchstaben standen darum so, als ob sie bei ihren Bewegungen und im Spiel ihrer Muskeln zu schaukeln begannen. Es war ein grosses E V E, so dass das Bild gleichsam symmetrisch war. Sie hob zu diesem Aufschreiben ihres Namens den Rock ganz hoch, und liess ihn dann wieder fallen. Später erschienen die Eltern oder Verwandte dieses Mädchens, die wegen ihres Aufenthalts in dem leichtlebigen Las Vegas besorgt waren. Ein anderer Mann sagte im Scherz, um diese Besorgnis zu zerstreuen. und also ironisch: "Ja, sie hat sich schon ihr Monogramm auf den Leib schreiben lassen". Er konnte nicht wissen, dass dies sogar wörtlich zutraf. Ich fürchtete schon, die Eltern würden diese Behauptung nachprüfen und dem Mädchen die Kleider abnehmen, aber sie nahmen die Worte ironisch, wie sie gemeint waren, und prüften sie nicht nach. - Von hier ab wurde die Handlung sehr kompliziert und zugleich wie ein Film, den ich in Las Vegas (also am selben Ort wie vorher) sah. Ich habe aber das kompliziete Verhältnis nicht richtig behalten. Es spielte noch eine zweite Frau mit, die ebenfalls sehr attraktiv war. Diese war aber in einem Mann verliebt. Dieser Liebe stand aber irgend etwas entgegen - ich glaube, dass sie als Mann verkleidet war. Als aber dieses Hindernis fortgeräumt war und sie mit langen wallenden Haaren dastand - also ganz als Frau und so neben der anderen Frau stehend -, erwartete nun jeder, sie werde nun zu dem Man gehen -, aber statt dessen stellte sie sich unerwartet der anderen Frau gegenüber - die in der ganzen Zeit ihre engste Freundin gewesen war, und sagte, dass sie nun immer bei dieser bleiben könnte. Wir waren verblüfft - während wir schon die Seligkeit auf beiden Gesichtern sahen- bis es uns langsam klar wurde -: sie war doch ein wirklicher Mann, der sich nur die Haare hatte lang wachsen lassen - und stand nun da mit ihren langen wallenden Haaren, die sehr erotisch wirkten, und war zugleich ganz wie eine Frau und ganz wie ein Mann. Ich hatte aber das Gefühl, dass doch lesbische Züge in der ganzen Geschichte, die nun zugleich das Ende eines Films war, mitschwingen, und ging zugleich fasziniert und doch nicht ganz befriedigt aus dem Film heraus.- Dieses Ende der Filmhandlung mit seinen Komplikationen war aber in der ganzen vorhergehenden Traumhandlung schon irgendwie angelegt und vorbereitet (obwohl ich nicht mehrt zeigen kann, wie).

Ich sehe noch die Niederschrift mit der teilweise etwas dick laufenden Tinte vor mir - etwas unruhig und unregelmässig wie nächtlich niedergeschriebene Träume. Danach war ich sehr beruhigt und vergass - wie im allgemeinen nach der Niederschrift - die meisten Einzelheiten. Ich kann mich jetzt am Morgen überhaupt nicht mehr an den Inhalt des im Traum aufgeschriebenen, aber vorher sicher wirklich geträumten Traums erinnern. (73 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1846 (1957-11-20 - Freiburg)Mausewagen - Hundewagen - Menschenwagen. 1. Szene: Eine Maus zieht Billchens Wagen (ein Spielzeug-Kastenwagen von ca. 30 cm- Länge) durch das Zimmer - zuerst auf dem Fussboden unter dem Schreibtisch - dann von da aus auf mein höheres Bett - von da aus auf die noch höhere Kommode und von da aus im Sprung auf Emmes Bett. 2. Szene: Ich gehe eine ziemlich steile Strasse hinab. Ein Mann fährt dort in einem Pferdewagen ohne Pferd mit langer Deichsel, den er ganz ungeschickt und ohne abzusteigen dreht, wobei er von der Strasse geraten muss. Ich biete ihm an, die Deichsel anzufassen und auf der abschüssigen Strasse in die richtige Bahn zu lenken. Er nimmt mein Angebot an, und ich lenke und bremse nun den Wagen die steile Strasse hinab. Dabei wird aber die Geschwindigkeit immer grösser, so dass ich laufen muss. Hinten mündet die steile Strasse in einer Kreuzung auf eine breite Querstrasse mit starkem Autoverkehr. Ich kann den Wagen nur noch geringfügig bremsen. Es ist reine Glückssache, ob es mir gelingt, einen Zusammenstoss zu vermeiden, wobei ich eins der vorbeifahrenden Autos seitlich rammen würde - aber es gelingt irgendwie. Dem Fahrer auf dem Wagen scheint das Ganze gleichgültig. 3. Szene: Ein Hund zieht einen Wagen in Schwerin über den Tugendpfad. Einzelheiten habe ich vergessen. Ich glaube, dass der Hund sich mit dem Wagen selbstständig machte und es fraglich war, ob er ans Ziel kommen würde oder nicht. (237 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1847 (1957-11-24 - Freiburg)Ich gehe mit Hf. und seinem Freund spazieren. Irgendwo finden wir auf der Strasse einen Kinderwagen mit einem schreienden Baby. Ich nehme - kaum das lebhafte Gespräch unterbrechend - den Wagen einfach auf den Spaziergang mit, um das Kind zu beruhigen, ohne mir überhaupt viel dabei zu denken, und schiebe ihn nun vor mir her. Am Ende des Spaziergangs kommen wir an die Stelle zurück, wo der Wagen stand, und ich lasse ihn nun hier einfach stehen. Dabei merke ich aber, dass der Wagen an jener Stelle, wo er stand und nun wieder steht, in Gefahr ist, ins Rollen zu kommen. Ebenso droht das Kind, das sehr lebhaft ist, herauszufallen in ein kleines Wasserloch auf dem Weg.- Oder fällt es schon wirklich heraus? (Ich habe diesen Punkt nicht ganz genau in Erinnerung - vielleicht war das im Traum auch zweideutig). Ich nehme das Kind in die Hand - das Kind ist Billes kleiner Teddybär - doch das kommt mir im Traum ganz selbstverständlich vor, ist keinerlei Problem - und gehe auf das am Wege stehende Haus zu, in das das Kind wohl gehören muss. An der Haustür eine ganze Reihe von Klingeln und Namen. Ich drücke auf eine der Klingeln, die zum Parterre gehören (wie ich es immer in solchen Fällen tue, wenn ich nur irgend eine Klingel im Haus überhaupt drücken will, weil die Leute im Parterre den kürzesten Weg zur Tür haben. - Diese Überlegung ist im Traum nicht ausdrücklich, sondern vorausgesetzt). Eine dicke unhöfliche Frau erscheint in der Tür und antwortet auf meine Erklärung, das Kind gehöre nicht in dieses Haus. Sie schlägt die Tür zu, und ich kann gerade noch fragen, wohin das Kind denn gehört. Sie antwortet: "Der Name steht doch auf dem Wagen". Ich entdecke in der Tat an der Vorderwand des Korbkinderwagens, der schon ziemlich alt und abgebraucht ist, ein Zettelchen, auf dem mit Bleistiftschrift der Name "Z." steht. Doch bin ich nun erst recht in Verlegenheit, denn die Frau hat die Tür zugeschlagen (den letzte Satz rief sie übrigens aus dem Fenster neben der Tür) und ich weiss garnicht, wo diese Familie wohnt. Ich frage ein vorbei kommendes Kind, ein Mädchen, das offenbar ins Haus gehört. Sie sagt, die Leute seien hier zu Besuch gewesen, gehörten aber nicht ins Haus. Ich frage, wo sie wohnen. Sie sagt: "Ich glaube in der Blutstrasse". - Mir wird nun allmählich die Situation klar. Die Leute müssen beim Weggehen den Kinderwagen vermisst haben, den ich ja auf dem Spaziergang einfach mitgenommen hatte, und werden nun in grosser Aufregung sein. Ich muss also alles daran setzen, die Wohnung der Leute so schnell wie möglich ausfindig zu machen. Ausserdem beginnt in mir das Schuldgefühl für meine so selbstverständlich begangene Handlung, die ja nur eine Hilfe für das Kind sein sollte. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwache ich. (467 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1848 (1957-12-07 - Freiburg)Sehr intensiv geträumt, doch alles ebenso entschieden vergessen. Es ist dies ein merkwürdiger Vorgang, der in gewissen Abständen immer wieder eintritt. Es gehört dazu, dass man weiss, etwas irgendwie sehr wichtiges geträumt zu haben, dass es aber dem Zugang wie absichtlich entzogen - gleichsam unter einer dicken Decke versteckt, in einem Verliess verschlossen scheint. Es ist nicht wie die anscheinend belanglosen Träume, die man vergisst, sondern das Gefühl der Wichtigkeit gehört dazu. Inhaltich ist mir nur ein Bild in Erinnerung. Ein Man, der sein Rad ganz hoch und kunstvoll mit Holz bepackt hat wie eine sehr kunstvoll gebaute Holzmiete, damit aber fährt, ohne dass etwas herunterfällt. Er ist sehr stolz darauf - in dem stillen, etwas arroganten Stolz des Bastlers. (120 words)

Wir liefen die Treppen rauf und runter, schauten in die Röhre und Kuppel des Turmtreppenhauses und betraten das wunderbare Schiff mit den barocken Altarfiguren, die wir dort nicht erwartet hatten. Sie waren wie lebendig. Dort gerade ein Gottesdienst - aber wir konnten unbefangen dazwischen stehen und die Figuren betrachten. Die Farben waren in dem Kirchenschiff wohl blau und rot und leuchtend. Meine Partnerin bei alle dem war Gisela, die aber zugleich auch Züge von Emme trug. Dann standen wir vor der Kirchentür und wollten noch nach Hause, um uns zu geniessen. Ich musste aber bald drauf in einem Werk ausserhalb der Stadt in einem Vorort sein. Es war wie Hamburg und Harburg. Mit den Rädern hätten wir es nicht geschafft. Ein Mädchen, das aussah wie Ina (die schon oft in meinen Träumen vorkam) riet, die Räder doch einfach stehen zu lassen und ein Auto zu nehmen. Sie war selbst mit einem Begleiter da und konnte sich in unsere Situation versetzen. Ich erwachte bei starkem Föhnsturm und mit dem Gedanken, wie wir geniessen würden. (177 words)

Am Treppenabsatz, wo man von der unteren Wohnung her gesehen werden kann, fragte ich sie: "Ist Dein Mann zu Hause?" - Sie antwortete nicht, sondern küsste weiter - bis vor die Wohnungstür, und ich erwachte, als sie durch die Tür verschwand. In dem Traum war also Inge verheiratet, was aber im Traum ganz selbstverständlich war. Als ihr Mann figurierte Herr L., (der ja mit seiner Frau unter uns wohnt) und sie wohnten in der Etage unter uns. All das war im Traum ganz selbstverständlich, völlig unreflektiert. Der Reiz des Küssens war noch dadurch erhöht, dass sie auch verheiratet war, dass es also sozusagen doppelt verboten war, ihr und mir. (139 words)

Dann kommt Gregor. Der organisiert alle Anderen. Er sieht mich mit dem Mann auf dem Fussboden liegen und horchen - ich glaube auf eins der Tiere. Es muss komisch aussehen (Es lässt sich sehr schwer beschreiben!) Dann hör ich einen Oberarzt furchtbar schreien. Ich stehe auf und rufe etwas wie: "Das ist unerhört". Ein Mädchen, das gerade vorbeigeht, wohl eine Krankenschwester, erschrickt furchtbar. Ich sage zu ihr: "Sie sind nicht gemeint", und berühre sie mit der Hand am Bauch. Dann trete ich auf den immer noch schreienden Arzt zu und verbitte mir es - auch im Namen des Studenten. - Da führt ihn eine Schwester ab. Da erst merke ich: es ist gar kein Arzt oder Vorgesetzter, sondern ein kranker Epileptiker, ein Verrückter. Die Leute halten aber meinen Auftritt für gespielt - für eine kathartische Behandlung, und ich merke, dass ich in ihrem Ansehen dadurch gestiegen bin. (214 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1871 (1957-12-23 - Freiburg)Wir waren bei Lotzens, Emme und ich, während Bille unten schlief. (Die Lage der Wohnungen, untere und obere Etage also vertauscht). Frau Lotz gab mir eine amerikanische Zeitung mit Bildern über einen deutschen Revuefilm, den ich gesehen hatte. Es waren Frauen mit Kostümen die den Bauch nackt liessen. Plötzlich hörten wir Billchen. Sie schlief garnicht, sondern turnte herum. Gucka (Frau Roguszka) war zu ihr gegangen und wollte bei ihr schlafen. - Wir sollten unten bei Frau Lotz schlafen. (Lage der Wohnungen also jetzt wieder wie normal.) Emme sagte, Gucka hätte nasse Wäsche auf Billchens Bett gezogen und deshalb wolle Bille nicht drin bleiben. Aber Gucka wolle das nicht einsehen. Sie solle sehen, wie sei damit fertig würde. (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1872 (1957-12-23 - Freiburg)Anderer Traum, früher in der er Nacht, handelte in einem alten Haus, in dem wir eine Wohnung bekommen sollten, oder zwei Zimmer. ich stand in dem sehr verfallene Treppenhaus. Merkwürdige Stricke oder Drahtseile hingen von der schwarzen D Decke herab. Sie schienen durchs Fenster durch nach draussen zu gehen. Ich zog daran. Da setzten sie sich permanent in Bewegung, wie Seil- oder Drahtwinden, die von selbst ablaufen (wohl wenn ein Gewicht daran hängt). Ich fürchtete eine Katastrophe. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1873 (1957-12-24 - Freiburg)Ich wohnte als Untermieter in einem Zimmer, in einem Salon wie Neuenschwanstein. Die Wirte hatten alles darin gelassen. Eine wertvolle alte schöne Madonna stand neben staubigen Leuchter-Engeln, und meine Sachen lagen dazwischen. Zum Fenster war der Blick auf einen herrlichen See. Es war Nacht. Ich hatte einem Bekannten, einem Juristen, den ich kannte - der mich früher einmal als Zeuge vernommen hatte -, erlaubt, durch mein Telephon einen Vortag über den Rundfunk zu halten. Er sprach über das Recht, ich glaube, bei Homer. Ich war erstaunt, dass er frei sprach. Als er ging, begleitete ich ihn ein Stück in den Park. Als ich zurückkam, hing ein Schild an der Tür - es war Reklame von einem Mittagstisch. Ich fürchtete schon Einbrecher im Haus, weil mitten in der Nacht das Schild dahin gekommen war, und steckte den Schlüssel mit Sorge ins Schloss. Aber das war nicht. Das Licht ging an verscheiden Stellen nicht. Ein Teil der vielen Lampen war wohl durchgebrannt. Dann nahm ich heimlich die alten geschnitzten Sachen in die Hand. Ich stellte fest, dass ich nicht wusste, welche Sachen mir gehörten, welche dem Schloss. Ich dachte, ich müsse Emmi fragen. Ich machte mir Sorgen wegen ihrer Krankheit. - Dann sah ich Blätter mit unter anderem Zitaten über den Traum. (210 words)

Ich sage: Max Müller - der gerade da wohnt. Er klingelt unbefangen. Ich bin dafür mit Emme wegzugehen, um nicht aufdringlich zu wirken. Auf dem Heimweg treffe ich meinen Vater. Ich schiebe einen Kinderwagen. Plötzlich - bei einer Verkehrsampel - nimmt er aus Versehen einen anderen Kinderwagen mit, im Glauben, es sei der unsere. Ich bringe ihn zurück. Weiss nicht ganz genau, wo er stand. Warte darum auf die Mutter. Kind weiss seien Namen nicht. Ich hab's in eine Cellophantüte verpackt. Mutter kommt - vom Friseur.

Es ist eine richtige Altstadt, von deren Existenz ich keine Ahnung hatte. Ich denke: Merkwürdig, in Freiburg kennt man jedes alte Haus und hier - in der eigenen Heimatstadt - ist eine ganze Altstadt, von deren Existenz man nichts geahnt hat.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1921 (1958-01-15 - Freiburg)Ich bin irgendwo, wo allerhand Zeitschriften auf dem runden Tisch liegen. Jemand erklärt mir etwas über die Titel und die Art der vielen ausländischen Illustrierten, die dabei sind. Da ist z.B. eine mit den Namen "I Musici". Er spricht das aus "i Musiki", also französisch. Ich sage: "Ach ich wusste garnicht, dass das so heisst, ich habe immer Musitschi dazu gesagt" (also italienisch), sage dann aber im Verlauf des weiteren Gespräches zu Inge ganz einfach "Musiki". Inge sagt: "Ich mag viel lieber die deutschen Zeitschriften" und greift zu einer Illustrierten wie "Ihre Freundin", oder "Constanze". Wir blättern darin und finden Modebilder. Sie sagt, auf ein Bild zeigend, das ist z.B. ein sehr schöner Bademantel, den ich mir nachschneiden will. Ich betrachte das Bild und entdecke und sage sofort, dass der Mantel genau den selben Schnitt hat wie der Mantel von Dior, den sich Emme nachgeschneidert hat, einen kimono- artigen Schnitt mit ganz wenig Nähten. Das Erstaunliche an dem Bild ist aber, dass die Frau den Mantel so raffiniert angezogen hat, dass er ihren Busen nackt herauskucken lässt. Inge meint auf meine Bemerkung zum Schnitt hin, etwas anders sei er unten in dem angesetzten Stück aber doch geschnitten, und will mir das beweisen, mir innen an dem Mantel eine Naht zeigen. Sie knöpft ihn darum an dem Bild einfach unten auf. Das geht auf dem Bild. Darüber wundere ich mich im Traum aber weniger als darüber, dass sie ihn ungeniert aufknöpft, denn wenn die Dame oben nackt ist, muss sie es doch auch unten sein. Da ist aber ein Irrtum, denn es zeigt sich, dass sie unten sozusagen einfach in Stoff übergeht, und zwar den selben Stoff, aus dem der Mantel gemacht war. Das Bild muss irgendwie retuschiert sein. Was war in einer deutsche Zeitschrift auch anderes zu erwarten, denk ich und erwache. (302 words)

Emme hat sich dort niedergelassen und will sich etwas sonnen, weil es für den Winter in der Sonne relativ warm ist. Sie zieht ihre Jacke aus, aber ihren Umstandsrock nicht. Ich sehe auf der anderen Strassenseite, an der Ecke Kaiserstrasse-Rempartstrasse, einige Männer und Frauen in Badeanzügen stehen. Sie müssen aus einer Art Innenschwimmbad kommen, das dort an der Ecke untergebracht sein muss. Dann sehe ich auch schon, wozu sie dort stehen. Es kommt eine Art Vorbeimarsch von Sportlern oder Umzug. Diese sind nun allerdings alle sehr bieder verpackt angezogen und haben Musikkapellen. Sie marschieren aber sehr zackig. Emme will es auch sehen. Sie geht sehr nahe an den Rand des gitterlosen Dachgartens und starrt auf den lange dauernden rhythmischen gleichartigen Zug. Ich habe Angst dass sie schwindelig wird und herabfällt und kann sie kaum zurückhalten. (151 words)

Ich habe grosse Angst, beherrsche mich aber, um ihm ganz ruhig Anweisungen zu geben, und rufe ihm zu: "Aufspringen, - Bille fragen, welchen Hebel sie gezogen hat, - Hebel zurückstellen."

Es gehörten noch andere Leute, wohl Assistenten, dahin. Aber die waren nicht da. So sass ich mit ihm allein an dem Tisch. Ich blätterte in einem Buch mit Abbildungen, die etwas den Rubensstil imitierten -und religiöse oder sonstwie etwas hochtrabende Unterschriften hatten -, die aber primitiv sinnenfreudig waren.

Sie kommt während der Aufführung zu mir in den Zuschauerraum und setzt sich auf meinen Bettrand (das ich offenbar im Zuschauerraum stehen habe). Wir unterhalten uns über die ganze Inszenierung. Sie erzählt, dass alle Bewegungen des Bühnenkörpers in kreisförmigen Bahnen vor sich gehen, und stellt zur Demonstration eine solche Bewegung ein, bei der die Bühne sich in zwei Teile teilt; die in einer Bewegung auseinanderrücken, deren Bahn am besten der Figur eines steilen Barockgiebels vergleichbar ist. Während dies geschieht, sagt sie: "Ich muss jetzt schnell wieder nach vorn (d.h., zur Bühne) gehen, weil ich sonst zu spät komme, weil der Weg länger geworden ist". Denn auch dieser Weg geht kreisförmig am Rande des Zuschauerraums entlang. Ich gehe nun fort - wohl weil ich sie jetzt doch nicht mehr sprechen kann und bloss zukucken nicht so schön ist. Auf der Bühne ist heitere Musik. Grosse Chöre, die dort aufgestellt sind, singen - wohl italienisch mit barockem Einschlag.

Ich sehe noch, dass sie sehr geschickt fällt und wohl nur wenig den Kopf aufgeschlagen hat, muss aber - möglichst ruhig warten, bis Emme wirklich das Baby übernommen hat, damit nicht auch das noch herausfällt. Dann springe ich ab und laufe zu Billchen, die gerade wieder zu sich kommt. Sie war einen Augenblick anscheinend bewusstlos. Sonst ist ihr nichts passiert. - Andere Szene: Ich will mit einem Auto mit Bille zu der Stelle zurückfahren, wo sie aus der Bahn gefallen ist, um zu sehen, ob sie es noch weiss, um einen eventuellen Schock aufzulösen. Das Auto steht aber auf der falschen Seite und Zusammenstoss droht. Ich komme nicht richtig auf den Steuerplatz, sondern nach hinten zu sitzen und kann darum nicht an Bremse und Gashebel kommen. Dann ist es ein Bambiauto (Zweisitzercoupé, wie Bambi hatte), mit dem ich fahre, jetzt allein. Ich fahre bis zur Grenze, die hier ganz nahe - wohl die Schweizer Grenze - und kehrte um. Ein Zollbeamter hält mich an. Ich will ihm erklären. Er sagt: ich weiss: Sie waren nur ganz kurz über der Grenze. Ich: Nein überhaupt nicht, aber ich weiss, dass Sie mich auf alle Fälle kontrollieren müssen. Er lässt mich die Schuhe ausziehen, da alle Leute barfuss sein müssen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1963 (1958-02-16 - Freiburg)In Schwerin im Elternhaus. Im Radio spielt sehr schöne Musik, die ich kunstvoll angestellt habe. Tessen-Werner will am Radio drehen. Ich bitte ihn, die Musik, der ich schon seit längerer Zeit während des Gesprächs zuhöre, nicht wegzustellen. Er tut es trotzdem und stellt sehr läppische Operettenmusik ein. Auch Alli steht dabei auf seiner Seite. Ich gehe wütend hinaus und will, um mich zu rächen, die Sicherung rausdrehen, was im Wohnzimmer das Licht und Radio zum Erlöschen bringen würde. Aber so viele Sicherungen ich auch an Sicherungskasten loslöse, ich höre die Musik immer weiter. Keine ist die richtige. Schliesslich entdecke ich noch zwei Sicherungen auf einem Extrabrett neben der Wohnzimmertür. Diese müssen es sein. Als ich darauf zu gehe, um sie loszudrehen, höre ich drinnen die Stimme meines Vaters, der dazugekommen ist. Er sagt gerade: "Ich muss zu Theodor Litt" (oder Lipps) "gehen und mit ihm darüber sprechen." Sie sprechen über mich. Es handelt sich um ein Gespräch, das ich mit Theodor Litt oder Lipps hatte. Ich bin empört über die Einmischung und stürze ins Zimmer. Mein Vater macht meine (wohl polemische) Einstellung zu Litt (Lipps), mit dem er über mich sprechen will, was ich als ungeheure Beleidigung empfinde, lächerlich und sagt bloss: "Wann machst Du endlich Examen?" (Erwachen mit starker Erregung. Draussen Föhnsturm).- Während ich an den Sicherungen drehte, war übrigens jemand im Nebenraum im Bad. Ich fürchtete, durch das Drehen einer falschen Sicherung, ihn des Lichts zu berauben. Ich drehte darum alle ausprobierten Sicherungen immer sehr schnell wieder fest. (250 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1964 (1958-02-16 - Freiburg)Gespräch über Tintoretto und noch einen anderen Maler (vielleicht war es Renoir, ich erinnere mich an den Namen nicht mehr richtig). Es ging um die Leuchtkraft, die die Bilder (Tintorettos) auch noch im kleinsten Detail - auch noch in einer Ausschnittvergrösserung, in der man sie sonst nicht betrachtet, haben. Zur Anschauung diente ein ganz kleiner Ausschnitt, der, glaube ich, einen roten Apfel in dem schimmernden, glänzenden und hingehauchten (lasierten) Ton Tintorettos darstellte. (72 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1965 (1958-02-17 - Freiburg)Bootsfahrt. Ich ging erst am Ufer, einen Weg ähnlich wie den Tugendpfad (in Schwerin). Dann sah ich eine Bootsvermietung und gedachte, mit dem Boot über den See zurück zu fahren. Das Ruderboot war sehr merkwürdig. Ganz schmal und hinten offen. Die Dollen für die Ruder waren nur ganz kleine Vertiefungen ganz am Ende, wo die Bordwand aufhörte, im Holz, so dass man sich vorbeugen musste, wie auf einem Rennrad. Ausserdem waren die Ruder so schwer und grob aus Holz, dass ich das linke kaum richtig regieren konnte. So war es mir zunächst schwierig, ins freie Wasser hinaus zu kommen. Der Bootsvermieter fuhr in einem anderen Boot nebenher. Ich fragte ihn, ob er nicht zu mir einsteigen wolle. Aber er sagte, das Boot sei dazu zu klein. Weitere Einzelheiten der Fahrt, und ob ich ans Ende kam, habe ich vergessen. Die Topographie entsprach der des Schweriner Sees, wo die Abfahrrichtung zum Elternhaus geführt hätte. (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1966 (1958-02-18 - Freiburg)Lange Strasse. An einer Strassenbahnhaltestelle werden vom Schaffner alle Autos mit einem Lichtsignal immer gestoppt, wozu er extra aussteigen muss. Wohl weil es dort sehr gefährlich ist. Ich sehe das, indem ich mich auf der Strasse nähere. Zuletzt eine Bahn, deren Schaffner eine merkwürdige weisse Haube aufhat, wie ein Beduine - aus einem Handtuch. Es scheint eine Spielerei zu sein. Ich erreiche den Wagen gerade noch, als er abfährt, und steige schnell noch ein. Man kann ganz direkt einsteigen. Die ganze Wand ist eine Tür - wie bei alten Sommerwagen. Erst jetzt merke ich, dass es sich um eine Art Arbeits-. und Gerätewagen handelt. Der Schaffner lässt mich und einen Anderen aber trotzdem ein und knipst die Karten. Die Anderen sind Arbeiter. - Dann während der Fahrt unmerklicher Szenenwechsel: Das Fahrzeug ist jetzt ein Auto. Mein Ziel, in dessen Richtung mich die Leute mitnehmen, ist eine Friedhofskapelle, bei der er wohl Gisela wohnt. Das ganze Fahrzeug kommt mir etwas unheimlich vor. Schliesslich biegt es direkt in den Friedhof ein. Die Leute haben mehrfach etwas von Verbrennung geredet. Nun befürchte ich, dass sie zum Krematorium wollen. - Nun kommt das erwartete Unheimliche. Die etwas verwegenen Leute fahren mit dem Auto direkt eine Steintreppe herunter, die mehrere Absätze in Wendungen hat. Ich sehe, dass dies sehr gefährlich ist, da die Beschleunigung immer grösser werden muss. Es gelingt mir unter einem Vorwand abzuspringen. Meine Sachen (Aktentasche) werfen mir die Leute nach. Dann fragen sie mich nach etwas, das da liegt. Ich erkläre es ihnen. Es ist eine weisse Kameliabinde von Frau L. - Dann beginne ich meinen Weg in Richtung auf die Kapelle, in deren Nähe wohl Gisela wohnt. (276 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1967 (1958-02-19 - Freiburg)"Der Mond ist voll besetzt - - im Weltraum kann man nicht wohnen." Mit diesen Worten kam mir, ängstlich zum Mond und zum Himmel schauend ein kleiner schmaler blonder Junge im Nachthemd aus unserer Haustür entgegen, der offensichtlich schlafwandelte. Ich sagte zu ihm in beruhigendem Ton: "Alle Menschen können auf der Erde wohnen. Du auch. Du hast Platz in Deiner Wohnung" und führte ihn dabei ins Haus zurück bis an die Zimmertür. Die Leute hatten ihr Zimmer direkt zum Flur. Dort stand eine Wanne vor der Tür mit Wasser, die ihn offensichtlich schon beim Herausgehen wecken sollte und die er da umgangen haben musste. Er tapperte hinein und erwachte, sah mich und bekam ein verlegenes Gesicht. Ich beruhigte ihn schnell und ging fort, damit seine Eltern mich nicht sehen sollten. - Vor dieser Traumszene war noch eine andere Szene: Ich kam aus der Stadt zurück und fand das Haus merkwürdig verändert. K.'s waren dabei, einen Vorderbau machen zu lassen mit Treppchen und Balkons wie bei einer Villa um 1900 - ganz anachronistisch, aber zur Originalität des Hauses mit dem immer noch vom Luftangriff zerstörten Treppenhaus passend Das Ganze war nur Flickwerk und sollte anscheinend zur Kaschierung einer Garage dienen, die K. für sein Auto bauen wollte. So führten die Treppchen nicht zu wirklichen Türen, sondern nur zu Türattrappen die in Wirklichkeit nur kleine Mauernieschen waren. Andererseits war die wirkliche Treppe zur Haustür im Zuge des Umbaus abgerissen und noch nicht wieder aufgerichtet. (Dann kam der Szenenwechsel mit dem schlafwandelnden Jungen, der zur Haustor raus kam, wobei also die Treppe nicht fehlte.) (261 words)

Sie wirft allerhand Münzen auf einmal rein, hauptsächlich 50-Pfennigstücke und zuletzt eine grosse Münze, ein Ein-Mark-Stück. Dann zieht sie Tee und mehrere Schokoladentafeln heraus. Ich habe aber das Gefühl, dass nicht entsprechend so viel herausgekommen ist, wie sie Geld hinein geworfen hat, und drücke darum für alle Fälle auf den Geldrückgabeknopf. Durch Zufall ist aber im selben Moment ein Mechaniker an den Automaten herangetreten, der irgend einen Handgriff daran gemacht hat, durch den er ebenfalls Geld zurückgeben kann. Ein Zweimarkstück fällt in das dafür vorgesehene Fach. Nun ist die Frage, wem das Geld gehört. Wir greifen beide fast reflektorisch im selben Moment zu. Jeder zieht aber die Hand zurück und will dem anderen den Vorrang lassen. Überdem ist ein anderer Mann - im schwarzen Anzug - hinzugekommen, der, um die Sache zu klären, Emme erforschen will, wobei er in hypnotischem Ton auf sie einredet, während ich noch mit dem Automaten beschäftigt bin. Ich höre, wie er sagt: "Also, sie haben es als merkwürdig empfunden, dass der Automat so viel hergab". Emme antwortet: "Ja".- Ich schliesse daraus, dass sie wohl nur deswegen versäumt hat, für das letzte Geldstück auch noch eine Schublade in dem Automaten zu ziehen. Allmählich merke ich, dass der Mann in dem Gespräch Emme hypnotisiert hat. Beide setzen sich in Bewegung und gehen auf die Tür zu, neben der der Automat steht. Es ist eine Kirchentür. Wir treten ein. Die Kirche ist innen kleiner, als ich erwartet habe. Es scheint nur ein Teil des Kirchenschiffs zu sein - etwa eine Kapelle. Ich sehe, dass Emme nur einen Rock und einen Unterrock anhat, aber keine Bluse, als ob sie sie zum Stillen ausgezogen hätte. Ich halte den Mann, der sie in der Kirche eine Treppe rauf führen will, an und frage: "Was wollen Sie eigentlich - Halt!" Er antwortet: "Ich will ihr nur mein Zimmer zeigen". Ich frage: "Was sind Sie von Beruf?", weil ich mich wundere, dass er in der Kirche ein Zimmer hat. Er antwortet: "Vikar". Ich will ihm nun Vorhaltungen machen, dass er Emme gewollt oder ungewollt hypnotisiert habe, denn ich sehe, dass sie die Augen nur zu einer ganz schmalen Lidspalte geöffnet hat, wie es ist, wenn sie schlafwandelt. Ich überlege, dass ich Emme, ehe ich sie wecke, irgend etwas suggerieren muss, dass sie nicht erschrecken soll, wenn sei in der Kirche erwacht (Erwachen bei dieser Überlegung). (403 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1969 (1958-02-21 - Freiburg)Irgendwo vor einer Mauer sass ein Mädchen, die zwar sehr salopp - etwas zigeunerhaft, aber doch sehr nett angezogen war. Dazwischen lief ein Kind rum wie Billchen. Das eine Mädchen hatte etwas kleine Füsse, die nackt in den Schuhen steckten. Ihr fiel auf, dass das Kind fast so grosse Füsse hatte wie sie. Sie zog ihren nackten, vom Laufen etwas schwarz gewordenen Fuss aus dem Schuh heraus und hielt ihn an den ebenfalls nackten aber ganz weissen Fuss des Kindes, der kaum kleiner war. Die Mädchen sassen kauernd auf dem Boden. - Vorher andere Szene, wo eine Katze in den "Käfig"(das kleine Zimmer) kuckte, in dem Billchen schläft. (108 words)

Wir haben nichts davon gewusst, dass die Wohnung frei würde. Aber sie hat sicher hohen Zuschuss gekostet, den wir doch nicht zahlen könnten. Sogar das völlig kaputte Treppenhaus wurde neu gestrichen, allerdings nur provisorisch, und wird nur zwei Jahre halten. Die junge Frau kommt zu uns zu Besuch. Es ist eine sehr nette Wienerin. Sie erzählt von einem Besuch, wo sie eingeladen war, nur mit den Worten: "dam di dam da da dam da". Sie hält es für den Rhythmus eines Platonzitats, doch mir scheint es "Wanderer kommst Du nach Sparta..." zu bedeuten und sagen zu wollen, der eingeladene Besuch solle auch dort übernachten, weil ja das Zitat weitergeht "Du habest uns hier liegen gesehn".

Das Mädchen hat wohl Krebs oder eine ähnliche Krankheit. Am Schluss sagt die Frau zu dem Mädchen, sie hätte es besser gefunden, ihr dies zu sagen, da man Leuten wie ihr, die das Niveau hätten, es zu verarbeiten, es sagen müsse. Ich nehme an, dass man diese einfache Frau zu der Mitteilung ausgesucht hat, weil sie es am wenigsten pathetisch sagen kann. (96 words)

Das ärgert mich. - Hf., der daneben steht, will mich hinauf heben. Doch das hält praktisch mehr zurück. Schliesslich finde ich den Trick. Ich muss einen Moment schneller laufen als das Karussell, während ich mich an seinem Rand festhalte. Dann hebt mich die Fliehkraft hinauf. Auf dem Karussell ändert sich sehr bald die Situation. D. und andere Mitfahrer bauen aus Stühlen Barrikaden, über die das Karussell hinwefgfährt. Man muss die Füsse hoch heben. Die meisten stürzen ab. Schliesslich bin ich noch allein drauf. Das Karussell geht jetzt so schnell, dass ich Angst habe, abzusteigen. Ich warte, bis es von der Frau, die wohl die Geldeinnehmerin ist, von draussen gestoppt wird. (153 words)

Ich spreche vor allem für den barocken Teil. Stehe damit ziemlich allein. - In einer anderen Szene kommt ein Chor vor, in dem Männer mit nacktem Oberkörper singen.

Ich bin erstaunt über diesen Sinneswandel und erfreut. - Später gewandelte Szene: Emme geht jetzt auch zum Fasching. ich bleibe allein da, um die Kinder zu hüten. Wir wohnen auf einem Dachboden, den ich dabei erst richtig kennen lerne. So entdeckte ich expressionistische Gemälde von Ohren und mir fällt ein, dass ich in letzter Zeit oft von Ohren geträumt habe.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1986 (1958-03-01 - Freiburg)Ich gehe mit Emme - bei Gelegenheit eines Spaziergangs - in Benders Institut. Dabei hab ich die ganz kleine (4 Wochen alte) Bettina auf dem Rücken. Sie kann sich schon selbst festhalten, wie ich zu meinem Erstaunen feststelle. Oben im Institut ist aber grosser Betrieb. Es muss eine Art Fest sein, wohl ein Jubiläum von Bender, von dem ich nichts weiss. Überall sind Leute in schwarzen Anzügen. -Vorher war aber noch eine andere Szene, von der ich nicht mehr genau weiss, wann im Traum. Ich ging mit einem sehr intelligent aussehenden Professor, der der Professor Kroh aus Tübingen war, durch das Institut. Er kritisierte Benders Art der Korrespondenz, die man aus der Art irgend einer Ordnung im Bücherregal entnehmen konnte. - Danach war erst die Szene mit dem Fest, wo ich Bettina auf dem Rücken hatte. Eine ältere Dame im weissen Kleid - eigentlich Kittel -, die anscheinend da oben zu organisieren hatte, fragte mich auf mich zeigend: "Kann der tanzen?" - Ich sagte: "Ja, aber er hat keine Zeit". Dann war ich mit der Dame in einer Art Vorstadtstrasse, die mit vielen Erinnerungen für sie verbunden zu sein schien. Auch hier lag wohl noch eine andere Szene dazwischen, die irgend etwas mit Überschwemmungen einer Uferstrasse zu tun hatte, wie in Bonn oder Heidelberg. -Dann ging ich mit der Dame in ein Geschäft, wo es geschnitzte Figuren gab. Sie kaufte zwei sehr hübsche geschnitzte Figuren für Bille, einen kleinen Pfau, der mit dem Kopf und dem Schwanz wackelte, bei jeder Erschütterung - ähnlich wie die kleinen Schildkröten aus Walnussschale, die wir bei Billchens Geburt kauften -und eine ebensolche Schildkröte, aber ganz aus Holz. Es gab noch eine Menge andere solcher Schnitzfiguren, alle mit beweglichen Köpfen und Gliedern, die schwebend und spielend aufgehängt waren. Es waren wohl norwegische Schnitzereien. (298 words)

Er macht viele Bewegungen auf einmal wie ein Zauberkünstler, giesst zum Beispiel aus einer Flasche in irgend ein Gefäss am Fussboden, das man überhaupt nicht sieht, während er zugleich etwas anderes macht. Zuletzt essen wir. Er sitzt dabei auf einer Couch, Emme und ich auf Stühlen. Er erzählt, dass er sich gerne mit den Eiern stärkt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1995 (1958-03-09 - Freiburg)In einer universitätsartigen Umgebung sehr katholischer Prägung, in der mir mehrere Geistliche begegnen, zu denen ich ein sehr kollegiales Verhältnis habe. Einer von ihnen, der noch sehr jung ist, erklärt mir: "Ich bin freitags katholisch und Dienstag evangelisch" (es können auch zwei andere Wochentage gewesen sein), und auf mein Erstaunen hin: "Ich bin nämlich konvertiert und mache das alte noch. Dies kenne ich aus Göttingen aus meiner langen evangelischen Theologenzeit". Er erinnert mich an ein Gespräch, das wir vor der Göttinger Universitätskirche geführt haben. Ich helfe ihm während dessen in ein Priestergewand, bei dem hinten ein Band geknotet werden muss. Ein anderer Geistlicher - ein sehr netter alter Herr im Priestergewand, wohl einem anderen geistlichen Gewand - hilft ihm dabei, wobei wir uns nicht ganz einig sind, wie man eigentlich die Schleife binden soll. Plötzlich torkelt der alte Herr zurück und schlägt in einem Raum auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite des Ganges am Boden auf. Wir stürzen hinterher. Ich sage zu dem Kollegen: "Er ist tot". Der alte Herr schüttelt aber den Kopf. Der Kollege fragt nun: "Haben Sie eine Gehirnerschütterung oder eine Blutung?" Der alte Herr nickt bei Blutung mit dem Kopf. Ich sehe mich nach medizinischer Hilfe um und entdecke in einem Zimmer einen Kollegen, der zumindest eine medizinische Ausbildung erhalten hat. Ich rufe ihn herbei, und als er sich etwas langsam bewegt, winke ich ihn mit ungeduldigen Bewegungen her und zeige ihm den alten Herrn. Er ergreift ihn fachkundig und trägt ihn über den Gang fort - wohl in einen Operationssaal - die Umgebung ist so, dass auch die medizinisch klinische Seite der Universität in ihr enthalten ist. Im Vorbeigehen sehe ich an einer Tür ein Schild über einen Lehrfilm über Graphologie, der dort aufgeführt werden soll. Offenbar hat man die Schreibbewegung der Feder durch eine durchsichtige Schreibunterlage und durchsichtiges Papier von unten her gefilmt. Gleichzeitig scheint man dabei die Erschütterung gemessen zu haben - ähnlich wie bei einer Schriftwaage. Dies alles geht aus dem Anschlag hervor. Erwachen. (330 words)

Später wird daraus eine Rotte von Halbwüchsigen. Es ist vor einer Kirchentür, die offensteht. Drinnen ist Gottesdienst, den sie zu stören versuchen.

Der Raum hinten auf dem Dachboden war dabei viel grösser und geräumiger als in Wirklichkeit. Ich sagte zu Marias Reichardt, die jetzt die Begleiterin war, der einzige Mangel sei, dass dahinten kein Wasser sei. Sie meinte, man könne vielleicht eine Leitung von der unteren Etage anzapfen. Ich überlegte und kam zu dem Schluss, dass da keine sei. Doch da entdeckte ich plötzlich unter der Dachschräge ein marmornes Wasserbecken und eine Menge kleiner Wasserhähne und Rohre. Zum grossen Teil waren es wohl Übrlauf- und Ablaufhähne von Heizungen, denn sie fühlten sich warm an, aber wohl auch gewöhnliche Wasserleitungshähne dabei. Die Reichardt wollte sich offenbar gerne mit warmem Wasser die Hände waschen. Ich war aber skeptisch, ob man die Heizungshähne einfach öffnen durfte. Wir gingen wieder nach vorne und sie machte sich zur Rückreise in die Ostzone fertig. Sie sagte noch etwas von einem Pastor, der Fälle von einer bestimmten Krankheit (wie TB oder etwas Ähnliches) suchte, worauf ich offenbar bei den Trampler-Patienten achten sollte. (200 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#1999 (1958-03-11 - Freiburg)Traum : (Zweiter Traum) Ich sehe in einer Illustrierten Zeitung Bilder von einem Fallschirmmanöver. Man sieht Soldaten mit nackten Füssen und Stahlhelmen auf dem Kopf ins Wasser laufen. Irgendwo liegt eine Leiche. Der Springer muss beim Landen auf einem Zaunpfahl aufgeschlagen sein. Dann Szenenwechsel: In bin nun in einem Flugzeug und erlebe hier gleichsam die Begründung jener Bilder. Wir sollen mit dem Fallschirm abspringen und sind schon bereit, als einer der Offiziere den Befehl gibt, uns dazu nackt auszuziehen. Wir sind empört, besonders die anderen, die sich mit bewegten Worten dagegen wehren. Mir kommt es eigentlich ganz reizvoll vor, doch weigere ich mich. Ein Offizier kommt drohend auf mich zu. Es ist ein Neger, der mich mit seiner schwarzen Nase fast im Gesicht berührt. Die Anderen beginnen zögernd, sich die Hosen auszuziehen, oder die Schuhe. Mir ist im Traum irgendwie klar, dass dies die Ursache der vorher gesehenen Bilder ist, denn hätte der Springer Schuhe angehabt, so hätten sie ihn vor dem Durchbohrtwerden von dem Pfahl geschützt. Die Bilder hatten übrigens schon im Traum eine deutlich erotische Note. - Szenenwechsel: Eine Militärparade. An der Spitze fährt in einem uralten Mercedes der Generalfeldmarschall von Blomberg. Ich höre, dass er dies aus Sparsamkeitsgründen täte, weil er dafür sei, bei dem Aufbau des neuen Militärs sparsam zu sein. Ich sitze nun selbst in dem Auto und zwar mit den Rücken zur Fahrtrichtung, so dass ich den Anderen ins Gesicht sehe. Es sind alles sehr einfache, klare, kluge und gar nicht militaristisch aussehende Köpfe. Alle sind in Zivil - im Gegensatz zu den vielen Uniformierten in den folgenden Autos. Die meisten haben ziemlich kurz geschnittene Haare und scheitellose um dem Wirbel fallende Frisuren wie Kokoschka. Mir fällt ein, dass ich, der ich auch selbst eine solche Frisur habe, gut zu ihnen passe, obwohl ich sonst in militärischer Umgebung fremd aussehe. Es sind alles sehr intelligente Leute. Einer mir gegenüber kommt mir bekannt vor. Er hat eine typische Hohenzollernphysiognomie, etwa wie der Kronprinz, trägt aber am Rockaufschlag die FF-Nadel des Grossherzogs von Mecklenburg, die auch mein Vater trug. Ich denke, ich will ihn ansprechen, und erwache. (351 words)

Während noch der Jüngling, der dabei stand, mir eine lange Rede über die Vorzüge seiner Firma hielt, die mich garnicht interessierten, entdeckte ich, dass dort Blätter herumlagen mit technischen Einzelheiten meiner Ausarbeitung des Exner-Versuchs und eine Ankündigung, dass irgendwo der Versuch zur Unterscheidung der einzelnen Merkmale vorgeführt werden solle.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2014 (1958-04-13 - Freiburg)Ich war bei Inge. Ein anderer Mann war bei ihr, der sie umarmte und küsste. Ich war sehr eifersüchtig. Ich wunderte mich aber über diese Eifersucht und dachte, schon indem ich erwachte, über ihre Entstehung nach. (36 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2015 (1958-04-15 - Freiburg)Ich hörte bald nach dem Einschlafen eine furchtbare Detonation, von der ich mit Schreck und Herzklopfen erwachte. Ich dachte an irgend eine schreckliche Explosion, vielleicht eine Atomexplosion. Ganz vorsichtig zündete ich das Radiolicht neben mir an, um festzustellen, ob der Strom nicht unterbrochen sei. Das war aber nicht der Fall. Dann sagte ich mir, dass es vielleicht irgend eine Sprengung sei. Dann sah ich Emme im weissen Nachthemd reglos im Licht des Fensters stehen. Ich nahm an, dass sie sehr von der er Detonation erschreckt sei, die sich angehört hatte, als ob direkt neben uns ein Haus eingefallen sei. Ich stand auf, um sie zu trösten. Da stellte ich fest, dass ich nur den Lichtreflex an der weissen Wand gesehen hatte und Emme ruhig schlafend im Bett lag. Diese wachte nun von meinem Umhergehen in der Stube langsam auf und fragte, was los sei. - Sie hatte keine Explosion gehört. Draussen fuhren Autos, und es war alles in Ordnung. Ich hatte die Explosion nur geträumt. Vielleicht hatte ich den Auspuffknall eines Autos gehört. (173 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2016 (1958-04-15 - Freiburg)Heidegger hielt als Pfarrer in der Kirche einen Gottesdienst ab. Er tat dabei etwas Merkwürdiges. Er schob Gegenstände wie Kegel unter der Kanzel umher, liess einen grossen Krug rotieren und anderes, gab aber keine Erklärung dafür. Aller Aufmerksamkeit war sehr gespannt. Nach dem Gottesdienst hörte ich den Rektor, der in seiner roten Robe erschienen war, ihn fragen, was er sich dabei gedacht habe. Heidegger antwortete: "Nichts". Der ganze Vorgang war sehr faszinierend. In der Garderobe, die zur Kirche wie zu einem Konzertsaal gehörte, suchte ich ein sehr schönes Mädchen mit einem Pelzkragen auf dem Mantel, mit dem ich gekommen war. Ich konnte sie nicht finden, war sehr traurig und beschloss, sie in der Stadt zu suchen. Es war schon Nacht (120 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2017 (1958-04-16 - Freiburg)Ich war zusammen mit zwei anderen Leuten - als Rundfunkreporter bei Gadamer in Heidelberg. Israel war dort auch als sein Assistent. Er fragte mich nach Szilasi, dessen Assistent er ja früher war. Eine Reihe von Leuten sassen um Gadamer, die Fleisszeugnisse und ähnliches wollten. Es ging alles sehr still und sachlich zu. Einem der Studenten sagte er, dass er in Marburg studiert habe. Einer der Reporter begann nun ein Gespräch mit ihm, er habe auch dort studiert und sich beim Fall in eine Grube das Bein gebrochen. Gadamer wies diese Bemerkung als nicht zur Sache gehörig zurück. Gadamer sah im Traum anders und jünger aus als in Wirklichkeit. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2020 (1958-04-29 - Freiburg)Die Baumgärtnerin hatte ihre Speisekammer aus Versehen zweimal vermietet, einmal an die Studentin, die gestern eingezogen ist - mit ihr zusammen kam ich die Treppe rauf -, zum andern an Herrn Marahrens, der jetzt gerade kam und sich ganz auf ihre Zusage verlassen hatte. Sie sagte mir, er könne stattdessen im Grünen Zimmer wohnen, wenn er nur nicht gleich wieder ausziehen würde. Sie hätte dies ja sowieso nur aus Andenken an den Onkel Sowieso für sich behalten. Ich wandte ein, dass sie doch im Sommer immer im Grünen Zimmer wohnen würde und Marahrens dann ja wieder ausziehen müsste. Ihre Antwort war nicht ganz klar. - Als dritte, bzw. vierte Figur kam in dem Traum eine Studentin vor, die ihren grossen Koffer einfach auf der Strasse hatte stehen lassen und die ich zuerst irrtümlich für die neue Speisekammermieterin hielt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2022 (1958-05-10 - Freiburg)Langer ausführlicher Traum, in dem verschiedene markante Gestalten vorkamen, so ein Original, eine Art genialischer Landstreicher, der alle Züge von Orlop (dem Hellseher) trug, sehr zerfahren doch dabei kindlich war und spontan nach allen Geldscheinen griff, die in seine Nähe kamen - halb im Spass, halb im Ernst. So war es auch, als wir zusammen spazieren gingen. Hinterher war ein Zehnmarkschein weg, nachdem ich ihm einen 50-Mark-Schein, den er halb im Spass genommen hatte, gerade noch entrissen hatte. Am Schluss aber war der Zehnmarkschein weg. Niemand wusste recht, wo er richtig war. Es entstand eine Art Gerichtsverhandlung innerhalb der Gemeinschaft, zu der wir gehörten und die in einer Art Klassenzimmer tagte. Es wurde viel debattiert und vorgeworfen, aber niemand suchte richtig nach dem Zehnmarkschein, der letztlich genausogut durch eine Verwechslung wie durch das Stehlen-Spiel des Originals weggekommen sein konnte. Schliesslich kam jemand auf eine geniale richterliche Entscheidung. Er rief einem von uns zu: "Mörder steh auf" - dieser stand gehorsam auf, es war der ägyptische Staatspräsident Nasser- "und geh mit ihm spazieren". Das Original und Nasser mussten nun spazieren gehen, und der Mann erhoffte sich davon eine Klärung. Ich dachte und sagte, als beide rausgingen: "Die werden sich über alles unterhalten, nur nicht über das fehlende Geld". Nasser schien die offenbar mehr freundliche und als Spitznamen gebrauchte Bezeichnung, die sich auf seine stiernackige Gestalt beziehen mochte, nicht zu stören. - Dann kam eine Autoritätsperson, eine Art Lehrer, um die Probleme zu lösen. Ich schlug vor, vor weiteren Debatten doch erst einmal den Zehnmarkschein einfach zu suchen. Ein langer selsbstgestrickter Strumpf, an dem auch Gisela mit gestrickt hatte, spielte auch noch in den Traum herein. Hier wollte dieser Lehrer etwas an dem Patent-Verschluss der Strümpfe ändern, den sich Gisela ausgedacht hatte, die nicht da war, und ich schlug vor, hier doch zu warten mit einer Änderung, bis die da seien, die sich die Sache ausgedacht hatten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2023 (1958-05-14 - Freiburg)Vielfältige Träume, von denen mir nur Bruchstücke in Erinnerung sind. In einem spielte ein Konzert, in dem auch Catharina Valente und ihr Bruder mitwirkten. Bender hatte vorher eine Eröffnungsrede gehalten, in der er sagte, dass seit der Nazizeit eine Glocke der Kritik über etwas läge. - Ich weiss nicht mehr, worauf sich der Satz bezog. Auf jeden Fall kam gegen Ende der Veranstaltung Catharina Valentes Bruder auf die Bühne und sagte, dass seine Schwester nicht mehr auftreten wolle und streike -- wegen Bender (setzte er leise hinzu). Bender stand empört auf und fragte, was das zu bedeuten habe. Der Bruder sagte: "Glocke der Kritik". - Dieser Ausdruck hatte sich nun aber garnicht auf Catharina Valente bezogen, und es gab eine Hausdurchsuchung, an der er ich mich beteiligte. - Zweites Traumbruchstück: Ein Mann ging mit Messern auf mich los.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2025 (1958-05-20 - Freiburg)Traumszenen, deren Reihenfolge und Einzelheiten ich nicht mehr in Erinnerung habe, obwohl mich die Atmosphäre der Szenen noch sehr deutlich umfängt. - Ich wurde von einer Art Räuberbande angefallen und entführt. In einer einsamen Strasse nahe am Fluss trat mir ein Mann entgegen. Später war ich im Zimmer der Räuber. Am folgenden Tag kam ich wieder in die selbe Situation. Ich war dem Räuber irgendwie entkommen und hatte es versäumt, die Kriminalpolizei zu verständigen, weil mir die Sache am hellen Tag nicht mehr so gefährlich schien. Jetzt in der Dämmerung aber war ich unversehens wieder in die selbe Strasse am Fluss geraten, sah wieder die Autosperre, die die Strasse gegen Autoverkehr wegen Reparaturen sperrte. Ich vermied diese Strasse, an deren Ende mich gestern die Räuber gestellt hatten, und musste nun den ebenso einsamen Weg am Fluss gehen. Hier bin ich wohl aufgewacht. - Andere Szene (vielleicht vorher). Wir wollte einem Nacktklub beitreten. Dieser machte einen Umzug durch die Strassen, dem wir uns anschliessen sollten. Die Topographie der Strassen war dabei ähnlich wie in der Räuberszene. Ich liess den Zug vorbei defilieren, in dem zuerst irgendwelche Embleme getragen wurden. Dann kam die Gruppe der Männer und Mädchen, die ich daraufhin ansah, wie sei nackt sein würden und dass sei nackt sein würden. Die Mädchen hatten alle sehr offen Blicke. Eine war ähnlich wie Gisela. Zuletzt kam Emme, die sich schon dem Zug angeschlossen hatte. Wir gingen aber wieder fort, weil und die Atmosphäre zu sektiererisch war. (245 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2026 (1958-05-22 - Freiburg)Ich hielt ein altes Immatrikulationsformular in der Hand, auf dessen Rückseite die Mädchen von 1946 abgebildet waren, mit ihren langen weichen Kleidern und den grossen weitgeöffneten Augen. Ich war wie fasziniert von diesem Bild, aus der Zeit, wo ich das Studium angefangen hatte. Es waren Diors New-Look-Kleider, und der Blick der Mädchen hatte etwas Geöffnetes, Fasziniertes, Weiches - das jetzt einem ganz anderen Blick gewichen ist. Auf dem Formular hatte ich - wie Hf., der neben mir stand, feststellte - manches, so die Staatsangehörigkeit, nicht ausgefüllt. Ich sagte zu ihm: "Damals hielt ich es noch nicht für nötig, so etwas auszufüllen" und dachte im Stillen: Und es ging trotzdem! - Die Ganze Sache spielte bei einem Treffen, bei dem es, glaube ich, um die Verleihung von Ehrenpromotionen ging und bei dem auch Kai Schmidt di Simoni und seine Freundin Karenina waren, die sich beide durch lässige Gleichgültigkeit auszeichneten. So liessen sie zum Beispiel alle ihre Sachen einfach stehen. Karenina hatte eine rote Tasche, die ich, als sie sie stehen gelassen hatte, zu einem aufsichtführenden Studenten brachte, der die beiden auch kannte. (181 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2027 (1958-05-24 - Freiburg)Ich treffe Wellek in Freiburg wieder. Er spricht mich an und bezieht sich auf unser Gespräch in Wolfbach über die Möglichkeiten, bei ihm die Diplomprüfung zu machen. Er erklärt, dass das Semester in Mainz jetzt mit dem und dem begonnen habe. Ich antworte, dass es mir eben leider praktisch doch unmöglich sei, jetzt nach Mainz zu kommen und dort zu studieren. Er meint, dass mir mit einem nur kurzen Treffen direkt vor der Prüfung - ohne vorheriges Studium in Mainz - nicht viel geholfen sei, weil er so viel zu tun habe, dass in der kurzen Zeit ich doch nicht viel davon haben würde. Wenn wir dann eineinhalb Stunden zusammen gewesen seien, würde am Schluss nur er geredet haben. - Andere Szenen gingen voraus. Ich suchte ein Ausweichzimmer zum Arbeiten in einem alten Schloss. Dort waren alle Räume besetzt - aber auf dem Dachboden wollte man mir eine Art Abseite anbieten. Man hätte dorthin über Stühle, Tische, Leitern und Schränke klettern müssen, es war eine äusserst wackelige Angelegenheit. Diese Szene brach dann, glaube ich, ab und wurde von der mit Wellek gefolgt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2028 (1958-05-26 - Freiburg)Ich wandere von Freiburg aus nach Norden zu in Richtung auf einen Berg, von wo man die Stadt soll liegen können sehen. Es ist der Hohe Meissner. Bei der Wanderung gehe ich vom Münster aus. Während ich es im Rücken habe, erblicke ich andere Gebäude der Stadt, die ich einem Fremden zeige. Ich sehe auch irgendwo eine Landkarte, die zeigt, dass zu einem Fest, einer Art Volksfest, der Stadtkern - und Bertholdsbrunnen - gesperrt werden soll, wobei die Autos auf der Umleitung dann unmittelbar am Münster vorbei fahren werden. - Im Norden der Stadt scheint noch einmal das Münster zu kommen. Ich erkläre aber dem Fremden, dass es sich hier nur um eine Spiegelung handelt. Wo man unmittelbar an das Phantom herantritt, verschwindet es aus dem Blickfeld. Dafür wird nach Norden der Blick auf eine aus der Ebene aufragende Bergkuppe, den Hohen Meissner, frei, auf den ich nun zuwandere. Freiburg schwindet auf der Wanderung nach Norden aus dem Blickfeld. Schliesslich stehe ich vor dem Berg, der eigentlich nur eine Kuppe ist, die sich unmittelbar aus der Ebene erhebt. Um auf sie zu kommen, muss man vorher durch einen flachen See schwimmen. Er ist aber so flach, dass ich es vorziehe, zu waten. Dann erklettere ich die Kuppe. Von oben eröffnet sich nun ein unermesslicher Ausblick. Dörfer mit alten Kirchen am Horizont, Waldstücke, Felder, die Strasse, die ich gekommen bin, die nach Süden verläuft und nach einigen Krümmungen aus dem Blickfeld verschwindet - aber nirgends ist Freiburg. Ich wundere mich darüber, geniesse aber doch die Aussicht und versuche, ob ich nicht irgendwo am Horizont wenigstes das Münster entdecken kann - doch immer sind es nur Dorfkirchen. Schliesslich lege ich mich auf den Rücken zurück - schon im Begriff, die kurze steile Böschung zu dem See wieder herab zu rutschen und zu klettern, Da entdecke ich fast noch unmittelbar unter mir ausgebreitet, die Stadt Freiburg, mit dem Münster in ihrem Kern herrlich aus der Vogelschau zu sehen. Das alles konnte ich vorher nicht sehen, weil es wegen seiner unmittelbaren Nähe im toten Winkel meines Blickfeldes lag, gleichsam von meinem eigenen Körper für mich verdeckt, so dass ich es erst jetzt sehe, nachdem ich diesen ganz zurück gelegt habe. Ich kann mich deshalb auch nicht aufrichten, ohne das Bild des Münsters aus dem Augen zu verlieren, das wie der Kern einer Nuss in einer geknackten Schale unter mir liegt in seiner wunderbar gegliederten Form inmitten des Häusermeeres. - Ich bleibe darum weiter auf dem Rücken liegen und halte mich an einem Baum fest, um nicht den Abhang herab zu rutschen. Schliesslich drehe ich mich auch noch auf den Bauch. Auch dann ist das Bild, solange ich liege, das selbe. Dann rutsche ich den Abhang hinab und wate durch den See zurück. Dabei sehe ich oben auf der eigentlich garnicht hohen Bergkuppe ein wunderschönes blondes Mädchen mit langen nackten braunen Beinen und weissen Shorts, die ein wenig an Marylin Monroe erinnert. Auch sie geniesst im Liegen die Aussicht, um dann wie ich den Hang hinab zu gleiten. Doch löst sich irgend etwas, an dem sie sich gehalten hat, und ein Teil des Hanges und sie stürzt von oben herab in den flachen See. Doch ist sie so gefallen, dass sie sich nicht wesentlich gestossen hat. Sie watet heraus. Wir treffen uns draussen und beschliessen, zusammen ins Bett zu gehen. Erwachen. (556 words)

Alle Leute waren begeistert von dem Anblick und sofort sehr gelockert. Mir war sofort klar, dass das Spiel mit diesen Tieren wirklich heilend wirken musste. Es handelte sich um ein Heim für kranke, wohl neurotische Kinder, das von der Forschungsgemeinschaft eingerichtet und betrieben wurde. ich war zuerst erstaunt über den Plan der Anschaffung der sehr teuren Bären. Als ich sie und ihre Wirkung aber sah, war mir klar, dass der Kauf wirklich berechtigt war. Zierold war auch sehr stolz in seiner väterlichen Art. - Vorher Traum von Wellek, bei dem ich mehrere Wochen in Mainz war und mit dem ich guten Kontakt hatte (Mir fiel im Erwachen auf, dass ich einen Traum gehabt hatte, der mehrere Wochen gedauert hatte.)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2030 (1958-05-29 - Freiburg)Das Haus, in dem wir waren, war einsturzgefährdet. Es war zugleich eine grosse Wiese, auf die ein Amerikaner mit seinem Auto geraten war. Plötzlich sahen wir, dass immer weisse Brocken auf sein Auto herabfielen. Nach oben blickend entdeckte ich, dass es Gips von der Decke war. Ein riesiger Riss hatte sich gebildet. Das Haus, das auch die Wiese überdachte, drohte jeden Moment einzustürzen. Wir rannten in den "Käfig", um unsere schlafenden Kinder zu holen. Erwachen. (75 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2031 (1958-05-30 - Freiburg)Mit Emme stieg ich auf den Brombergkopf. Er war weniger hoch, als ich gedacht hatte. Dann war da ein Haus mit merkwürdig hohen Zimmern. Ein Schloss, in dem irgendwelche russischen Prinzen gewohnt hatten. Ich suchte ein Klo und fand schliesslich ein sehr primitives. Ich wunderte mich, dass die Prinzen kein besseres gehabt hätten. In dem Schloss zogen wir uns nackt aus und umarmten uns- es war zugleich auf der Spitze des Berges. Es war sehr schön. - Im Schloss hingen Bilder von den Prinzen, die zum Teil Mields sehr ähnlich waren. Wir überlegten, ob er auch ein verkappter Prinz sei. - Später war da ein Elefant - ich weiss nicht, ob es noch in dem Schloss war - , der Bauchweh hatte. Ich rieb ihm die Rippen. Das half. Wir fanden, dass er mehr Bewegung haben müsse - es war noch ein junger Elefant -, und liessen ihn in die Stadt gehen. Er lernte bald, sich nützlich zu machen, konnte allerlei Dienste ausführen, Sachen tragen und schliesslich sogar sich eine Pfeife stopfen. Die Leute mussten ihm dann Tabak geben. (179 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2032 (1958-06-02 - Freiburg)Ich kaufe etwas in einem Kiosk (dessen Besitzer dem des Kiosks an der Schwabentorbrücke gleicht). Dann geht der Mann aus dem Kiosk fort, während ich mich seitwärts auf eine Bank setze. Er lässt den Schlüssel in der Tür des Kiosks stecken, was mich wundert. Ich beschäftige mich mit einem Buch (oder etwas ähnlichem) und achte eine ganze Weile nicht mehr auf die Umgebung. Als ich wieder aufschaue, entdecke ich, dass man um den Kiosk eine Reihe von Dingen wie Barrikaden aufgerichtet hat. Ich weiss nicht mehr, was für Dinge es waren, aber dass ich darüber nachdachte, ob das eine gute Reklame sei und nicht vielmehr die Käufer abhalten würde. Dann erst kam mir der Gedanke, dass es sich hier um eine bösen Streich handeln könnte. Ich zog vorsichtig die Tür auf, deren Schlüssel noch immer steckte, und sah zu meinem Entsetzen, dass der Kiosk völlig ausgeplündert und leer war. Dann betrat ich - direkt daneben - die Universität. Auch hier sah es schlimm aus. Stühle waren aus den Sälen auf den Gang geschleudert, Katheder umgerissen und Ähnliches. Ich sah zwei Polizisten zusammen mit dem Leiter des Studentensekretariats, der immer ein bisschen wie ein Boxer aussieht, an der Aufräum- bzw. Feststellungsarbeit. Ich sagte zu einem der Polizisten: "Wissen Sie, dass draussen der Kiosk auch ausgeräumt ist?" Er lächelte und sagte: "Ja, da habt ihr ja schön was angerichtet." Er hielt das Ganze für einen guten Streich, an dem er mich beteiligt glaubte. Ich lüftete meine Mütze, dass er meine Glatze sehen musste, und sagte: "Darüber bin ich hinaus.". - Andere Szene: In der Stube: Ich höre draussen ein furchtbares Gepolter wie von stürzenden Lorenzügen. Ich schaue aus dem Fenster und sehe tatsächlich unter uns einen Bauzaun, der das Nachbargrundstück umzäunt, und Lorenzüge. Aber im Hintergrund auf der Fuchsstrasse (die in Wahrheit keine hat) ist eine Strassenbahn entgleist. Die Leute sind gerade dabei, die Bahn in die Geleise zurück zu schieben. Zu meinem Staunen sehe ich, dass drei bis vier Leute einfach in der Bahn sitzen geblieben sind. Einer liest sogar Zeitung. Ich kann nicht begreifen, dass die nicht ausgestiegen sind. Während ich dies noch zu Emme, die neben mich ans Fenster geklommen ist, sage, höre ich Kinder schreien: "Sie kippt". - Kreischen, Schreie. Die Bahn kippt langsam zu Boden. Die Insassen werden gegen die Glasscheibe zu Boden geschleudert. Furchtbare Schreie und Heulen. Ich ziehe Emme vom Fenster weg, die ganz verzweifelt ist. In der Erwartung, gleich die Sirenen des Unfallkommandos zu hören, und während ich Emme noch an mich ziehe, erwache ich mit grosser Erregung. (424 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2033 (1958-06-04 - Freiburg)Wachte (noch vor dem Traum) um sechs Uhr auf und grübelte wieder ... Dann schlief ich wieder ein und träumte:) Es war später am Morgen, aber noch immer verhältnismässig früh. Wir lagen noch in den Betten und die Gardinen waren noch geschlossen, als Mields hereinstürzte - ganz unerwartet, weil er ja zu dieser Zeit in Groffmanns Graphologiekursus seien musste, und sagte: "Groffmann hat uns alle nach Hause geschickt. Er hat gesagt, wir wüssten schon so viel, dass wir jetzt auseinandergehen wollten." Mields sagte: "Mir imponiert es sehr, dass er den Mut hat, die Leute nach Hause zu schicken." - Ich war sehr von der Sache beeindruckt. Erwachen schon sehr erleichtert. (110 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2035 (1958-06-04 - Freiburg)Dazwischen war noch ein anderer Traum: Ich schaute mit Emme aus dem grossen Fenster, durch das wir vom Kochtisch aus sehen. Wir sahen draussen ein entzückend gebautes Mädchen in Badehose mit schlanken sehr grazilen Beinen an der Ruine vorbeilaufen. Offenbar machte sei eine Art Morgenlauf, was uns sehr imponierte - vor allem wegen des Mutes, so wenig bekleidet in dieser Wohngegend zu laufen. Bald darauf sah ich an der selben Stelle - neben der Ruine - drei Autos scheinbar ineinander fahren, und zwar so, dass das mittlere zwischen den beiden anderen, dem vorderen und dem hinteren, eingeklemmt werden musste. Dann merkte ich aber, dass das mittlere leer war und von den beiden anderen offenbar nur geschoben wurde. Es war merkwürdig. Dann sah ich an der selben Stelle einen Motorradfahrer, der verwegen und blutig aussah. Ich wusste oder ahnte, dass er sich damit beschäftigte, Spaziergänger draussen auf der Landstrasse zu jagen, indem er sie einfach überfuhr und zur Seite schleuderte. Es war eine finstere Sache.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2036 (1958-06-05 - Freiburg)Sah einen Film über den Detektiv Schmidt ( aus dem Strip in der Bild-Zeitung). Ich überlegte zusammen mit Emme, wie die Aufnahmen gemacht worden waren. Man sah ihn auf einem in der Art einer Junggesellenwohnung nett eingerichteten Balkon - oder es war wie ein Dachgarten -, auf jeden Fall sah man darüber den blauen Himmel mit bewegten Wolken. Wir schlossen daraus, dass es eine Aussenaufnahme sein musste. Emme schien aber zu überlegen, ob es nicht doch ein künstlicher Himmel sein könne. Dann wandelte sich die Szene so, dass ich selber mitspielte. Detektiv Schmidt war in Brigitte Bardot verbliebt - aber ich auch. Noch eine andere Frau spielte eine Rolle, die eigentlich zu Schmidt gehörte und die sich am Ende mit ihm finden würde, so dass für mich Brigitte Bardot übrig bliebe. - Zweiter Traum: Frau Lotz hatte eine Unzahl von Kindern mit ihren Müttern eingeladen. Diese alle wuselten in der Wohnung rum. Wir auch mit den unseren. Ich sah bei der Gelegenheit, dass die Wohnung (von Lotzens) doch recht geräumig war und gut für uns wäre. (Es handelt sich um die Wohnung unter uns.) (184 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2037 (1958-06-07 - Freiburg)In einer Stadt wie Basel. Kirchen auf Hügeln, zu denen alte Strassen hinaufführen. Ich folge einer der Gassen bis hinauf zur Kirche, sehe direkt neben mir auf einem Nachbarhügel noch eine Kirche liegen, die ebenso aus dem Häusermeer hinauftragt, und steige dann über Treppen auf der anderen Seite wieder von meinem Hügel herab. Unten verlieren sich die Treppen in ziemlich tief liegenden Strassen, die in eine kaschemmenhafte Gegend führen. Alte Tore in alten Häusern, schuppenartige Eingänge, fragwürdige Gaststätten. Hier hat Professor B. ein Zimmer, offenbar einen Unterschlupf, in den er sich ungestört zurückziehen kann. Ich öffne die alte Holztür, die nur unzulänglich verschliessbar ist, und komme zunächst in einen Vorraum. Von draussen kommt ein Polizist vorbei, der mit einem Arm durch die Tür langt (deren oberer Teil für sich aufklappbar ist) an meine Brusttasche, dorthin, wo meine Brieftasche sein muss, und sagt: "Ihren Ausweis bitte". Ich halte seinen Arm fest und sage: "Erst will ich Ihren Ausweis sehen", weil ich vermute, dass er nur ein verkappter Räuber ist. Er bemüht sich immer unverschämter zuzugreifen, und ich packe immer fester seinen Arm und rufe um Hilfe. B. hört die Rufe und kommt aus seinem Nebenzimmer. Mit seiner Hilfe gelingt es mir, mich von dem Dieb zu lösen, die Tür wird aufgestossen und man erkennt nun, dass er nur eine Polizeimütze trägt, im übrigen aber Räuberzivil. Durch die obere Türluke, die er aufgestossen hatte, konnte man nur seinen Kopf mit der Polizeimütze sehen. Irgendwie war der Räuber - es kommt noch ein zweiter dazu -. dann ganz in die Flucht geschlagen, und wir sind jetzt in B.s Zimmer, dem Nebenraum, zusammen mit Inge, die auf dem Bett liegt. B. geht dann später weg, und ich bleibe mit Inge allein zurück. Inge liegt noch auf dem Bett und ich sitze etwas entfernt auf einem Stuhl. Nach einigem Zögern steh ich auf und setze mich zu ihr aufs Bett am Fussende und lege impulsiv meinen Kopf auf ihren Unterleib. Sie zuckt elektrisiert zusammen, ist ganz verändert, ganz Hingabe und sagt mit leiser melodischer Stimme: "Ich mag Dich nicht". Der Tonfall und das Du sagt aber das Gegenteil. Gleichzeitig gerät ihr Körper in rhythmische Zuckungen und meine Hände gleiten über ihre nackten Oberschenkel. Ich weiss, dass nun kein Halten mehr ist, allen guten Vorsätzen zum Trotz, und erwache.

Er sagte zu uns: "Jetzt muss ich Ihnen noch einen Witz erzählen", und zeigte uns dann eine Zeichnung, die ich aber zugleich wie einen Film oder als Wirklichkeit erlebe: Ein Gewässer, darin schwimmen zwei Enten mit vielen kleinen gelben Küken. Zu jeder Ente gehört eine bestimmte Kükenschar. Die sollen alle habilitiert werden. Nach einer Weile trennen sich die beiden Entenscharen. Die eine schwimmt seitwärts abbiegend ins Glottertal, die andere gradeaus. Zwei Entenküken, die eigentlich zur einen Schar gehören, schwimmen mit den anderen. Nach einer Weile entdeckt es die Ente, kehrt um und schwimmt mit den beiden Küken zurück. Die andere Ente will sie aber auch nicht mehr haben. Darum schwimmt sie wieder mit den beiden Küken zurück zur ersten Schar. Und so werden die beiden Küken von den beiden Enten immer hin und her gebracht. Keine will sie mehr haben. (157 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2040 (1958-06-14 - Freiburg)Ich kam wieder zu einer Tagung nach Oberwolfbach (Treffen der Psychologie-Stipendiaten der Forschungsgemeinschaft) in das merkwürdige, etwas verzaubert wirkende Schloss. Wir gingen alle automatisch wieder in die alten Zimmer. In dem meinen fand ich sogar noch Sachen liegen von dem Göttinger Fuchs, mit dem ich dort gewohnt hatte. Statt seiner war aber diesmal der nette Graf Hoyos mit mir im Zimmer (der an einem verkehrspsychologischen Institut arbeitet). - Zweiter Traum: Ich schaute aus dem Fenster auf eine Garage, zu der eine treppenartig schräge Auffahrt hinauf führt. In der Garage hat sich der Besitzer in sein Auto gesetzt, um damit rückwärts hinab zu fahren. Das Auto rollt irgendwie vorzeitig fort, glaube ich, es gelingt ihm aber, es richtig zu lenken. Nur kommt zur gleichen Zeit ein zweites, älteres, Auto, das ebenfalls in der Garage steht, ins Rollen, und zwar so unglücklich, dass es dabei auf das andere herabfahrende stürzen muss. Ich bin im Zweifel, ob der Fahrer dies schon bemerkt hat. Er könnte durch schnelles Gasgeben aus der Gefahrenzone gerade noch rückwärts hinaus kommen. Das andere leere Auto würde dann auf den Boden stürzen. - Aber er fährt ganz langsam. Ich merke jetzt, dass er das Auto wohl bemerkt hat, aber es mit seinem Wagen abfangen will. Das gelingt ihm auch Er fährt diesen so, dass die Räder des zweiten Wagens sich gerade auf das Dach des ersten, in dem er sitzt, herab senken, ohne dieses sehr einzudrücken. Doch klemmt offenbar die Tür, denn er versucht, hinten durch den Kofferraum hinaus zu kommen, wird aber nun selber eingeklemmt. Dies alles spielt sich in Sekundenschnelle ab. Ich will ihm nun zur Hilfe eilen, rufe laut "Emme", damit diese mir nachkommt, was er drüben in seinem Auto hört, und laufe hinab und will über den Platz zur Garage. Doch in diesem Moment ist es ihm gelungen, sich doch noch aus dem Auto zu befreien und ich erwache. (314 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2041 (1958-06-22 - Freiburg)Ich bin irgendwie auf Reisen - aber, ich glaube, zu Fuss - auf einem Bahnhof angelangt, von dem ich nicht weiss, zu welchem Ort er gehört. Ich stehe mitten auf den Geleisen. Es laufen hier viele Geleise, zu Teil im schrägen Winkel zwischen Gebäuden und Schuppen abgehend.. Ich muss mir überlegen, wie ich gehen soll, damit ich ausweichen kann, falls ein Zug kommt, und nicht überfahren werde, denn überall sind Geleise, die oft direkt an den Hauswänden entlang gehen, so dass ein Ausweichen nur durch Übertreten auf andere Geleise möglich sein würde. Ich muss also so gehen, dass ein solches zur Seite Treten immer noch möglich ist. Dies alles sind sehr schnell ablaufende Überlegungen, während ich meinen Weg suche. Ausserdem sind über mir Düsenjäger in der er Luft. ich weiss nicht, ob nicht vielleicht Krieg ist, und dann ist man auf einem Bahnhof besonders gefährdet. Ich weiss ja auch garnicht, an welchem Ort ich mich überhaupt befinde. Ich versuche darum, so schnell wie möglich Aus dem Bannkreis des Bahnhofs und dem Gewirr der Geleise heraus zu kommen. Als mir das gelungen ist und ich um das letzte Gebäude herum und aus dem Bahnhofskomplex heraustrete, erschliesst sich mir zu meinem Entzücken der Blick auf eine sehr schöne Stadt. Ich sehe breite Strassen mit irgend welchen Insignien. Ich weiss nicht mehr, waren es aufgerichtet Rösser oder ein aufgerichteter Vogel mit ausgestreckten Flügeln - auf jeden Fall weiss ich dadurch, dass diese Stadt Stuttgart ist. Ich gehe in die Stadt hinein, steige leicht eine hügelige Stadtgegend hinab, wo ich zwei sehr schöne gotische Kirchen liegen sehe. Ausserdem ein altes gotisches Haus, das mich von innen anzusehen lockt. Aus diesem Haus - wie aus einer der Kirchen - ertönt Chorgesang (Bachsche Musik). Ich öffne eine kleine Tür, die in eine Art Treppenturm führt. Darin sehe ich eine Wendeltreppe aus Metall, die wohl später anstatt einer ursprünglich steinernen eingebaut sein wird, doch ist sie so eng, dass ich mit meiner Mappe und einem kleinen Stadtköfferchen, das nicht grösser als ein Schulranzen ist und das ich wie einen solchen auf dem Rücken trage, nicht hineinkomme. Aber auch ohne diese werde ich im Rücken und Brustkasten gedrückt werden und dauernd gekrümmt sein müssen. Es ist, wie wenn ich durch ein ganz enges Gewinde kriechen müsste und ich kriege Atembeklemmungen und beschliesse, von dem Einstieg in die Treppe Abstand zu nehmen. - Ich gehe dann weiter durch die Stadt und gerate in eine Universität (die ein wenig an die neugotische Marburger Universität erinnert). Dort gehe ich auf ein Klo. Die Fenster liegen so, dass die Strassenpassantinnen in dieses Pissoir an einigen Stellen hineinsehen können. An gerade einer solchen Stelle stehe ich. Ein Student, der er es bemerkt, zieht mich bei Seite, und ich stelle mich an eine andere Stelle, merke aber, dass man hier unter Umständen auch hineinsehen kann, was mir auch persönlich nicht so schlimm scheint.

Irgend eine Gruppe hatte sich verabredet, gegen ihn Lärm zu machen. ich hörte, wie im Asta ein Student sagte, er habe dafür Geld bekommen. - Dann hielt Bender den Vortrag. Zunächst ging alles gut. Dann entstand eine Pause, weil Bender einen Text nicht finden konnte. Er kam zu uns und suchte danach. Die Pause wurde sehr lange. Es war schon gegen Ende der Vortragszeit, und die Leute richteten sich zum Gehen. Ich riet Bender, nicht länger nach dem Text zu suchen, sondern den Vortrag lieber so fortzusetzen. Die ersten Leute gingen raus. In diesem, Moment fing ein Randalierer an, Krach zu machen. Bender wollte den Vortrag abbrechen. Die Leute, bei denen der Krach nicht zündete, wunderten sich über den Randalierer. Dieser, in Verlegenheit geraten, gab zu, dass er dafür Geld bekommen habe. Ich sagte nun laut in den Saal, dass dieses Randalieren vorbereitet worden sei und ich wisse, dass noch Mehrere dafür Geld bekommen hätten. Bender schaute mich streng an und sagte: "Und was haben Sie dagegen getan?" Ich erwiderte: "Nichts - ich dachte, diese Leute würden sich, wenn sie es tun würden, dadurch selbst strafen." Ich hatte nämlich Bender nichts davon gesagt, um ihn nicht vor dem Vortrag befangen zu machen. (Erwachen: Es folgten Wachphantasien, in denen en ich den Randalierer schon vor dem Vortag mit List in ein Zimmer einsperrte, und ähnliches.) (233 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2044 (1958-06-29 - Freiburg)Ich tastete mich vor dem Münster über einen dunklen Parkplatz. Teilweise war der Boden durch Bauarbeiten aufgerissen, so dass ich mich an Sandwällen festlief, teilweise waren es unbeleuchtete geparkte Autos, an denen ich mich vorsichtig entlang tasten musste. Einige schienen sogar gerade noch in Bewegung - so wie man die Lichter unmittelbar im Moment des Anhaltens löscht -, oder gerade im Begriff anzufahren. Alles war sehr dunkel. Aber ich fand trotzdem meinen Weg über den Platz - es war zugleich auch etwas wie der Platz vor dem Schweriner Dom. Der Weg führte mich dann in ein philosophisches Seminar (wie bei Szilasi).

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2045 (1958-06-30 - Freiburg)Merkwürdige Wohnungen umgeben von einem museumsartigen Möbelgeschäft, das wohl antike Möbel verkaufte. Alle diese Räume, die unser Zimmer zu einer Wohnung ergänzen würden, waren möbliert, aber doch keine Wohnung, sondern dieser Laden. Ich ging mit meinem Bruder, der aber Hf. war - nur dieser als mein Bruder, was auch erst später im Traum richtig deutlich war, - da durch. Er hatte irgendwo in einem Raum dieses Ladens seinen Schreibtisch stehen. Das war nun wieder sein bewohnter Schreibtisch. Ein Bettstück, das wir bei uns trugen, legten wir irgendwo auf einem zum Verkauf stehenden Bett nieder. Der Verkäufer erlaubte es uns. Er setzte sich an seinen Schreibtisch und erklärte, er hätte so grossen Hunger auf eine Wurst. Es war eine Art Heisshunger. Ich versprach, ihm eine zu besorgen. - Szenenwechsel: Wir waren jetzt auf dem Wege zu einem Radfahrhändler, der aber sehr weit weg war. Dazwischen spielte noch etwas mit einer Strassenbahn. Es war jetzt, als ob unsere Wohnung (immer die von Emme und den Kindern, mir und ihm) etwas wie ein Strassenbahnwagen sei, den wir einfach an die Strassenbahn anhängen konnten. - Dann kamen wir zu dem Radhändler, der in einer provisorischen kellerartigen Werkstatt lebte. Die Brudergestalt betrachtete Räder, die jenseits eines Zaunes lagen und aus Leichtmetall zu sein schienen. So eines hätte er lieber gehabt, weil es weniger schwer wäre. Ich hob eins mit der Hand durch den Zaum hoch uns stellte fest, dass es nicht wesentlich leichter wäre als andere Fahrräder. Mein Bruder ging schon voraus - ich hinterher. Als ich einige Stufen hinab in die Werkstatt eintrat, war er aber noch nicht da. Da fiel mir ein, dass ich den Reparaturzettel nicht bei mir hatte. Der Mann wollte mir das Rad nicht ohne ihn geben. Der Weg, den wir zu gehen hatten, war sehr weit. Die Frau erinnerte sich an mich, dass wir hier schon oft Kunde waren und dass wir immer, Emme und ich mit der damals noch ganz kleinen Bille, in einem Boot oder Kahn auf dem Wasserweg gekommen waren. Auch ich erinnerte mich daran. Es muss ein verschlungener Weg gewesen sein durch Seen und kleine Kanäle. Es war nun, als ob ich aufwachte und mit Emme über diesen Traum und die Wasserwege sprach. Wir konnten uns dabei nicht auf den Verlauf dieser Wege besinnen, wussten aber, dass wir immer mit dem Boot gefahren waren, und waren davon merkwürdig angerührt. - Dann wieder andere Szene. Wir hatten neben meinem Zimmer merkwürdige kellerartige Räume, in denen vorher andere Leute, eine Art Armenfamilie mit vielen Kindern, gewohnt hatten und die wir nun mit bewohnen sollten, um endlich eine Wohnung zu haben. Die Leute hatten Zwischenböden gezogen, die die Räume ganz niedrig und eng machten. Diese rissen wir nun heraus. Ich hatte bald heraus, wie sie herein gemacht waren und nach welchem Prinzip ich sie raus reissen musste. Nun waren die Räume gross, verwinkelt und von eigenartigem Reiz, wenn auch noch sehr kellerig. Wir beschlossen, sie mit leuchtender Farbe anzumalen, und es war mir klar, dass es möglich sein würde, eine sehr eigenartige und amüsante Wohnung daraus zu machen (510 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2046 (1958-07-04 - Freiburg)Es war Fronleichnam. Bei dieser Gelegenheit hatte Emme alle unsere Kakteen neu gepflegt. Sie standen in ihren Töpfen noch auf dem Bett, wo Emme sie abgesetzt hatte. Inzwischen bekamen wir Besuch. Viele Männer, wohl Studenten, die sich auf das Bett setzten. Ich ermahnte sie, sich nicht auf die Kakteen zurückzulehnen. Einige waren so selbstgefällig, dass es beinahe doch passiert wäre. Ich sammelte schnell die Kakteen ein und stellte sie auf ein Tablett. Einer, ein turmartiger, hatte sich aus dem Topf gelöst. Ich drückte ihn wieder hinein. Er schien sich von der Wurzel gelöst zu haben, aber so, dass man beides wieder verbinden konnte. Inzwischen kam Emme zurück. Sie hatte unten in der Eisdiele lauter Franzosen getroffen, die mit ihr getanzt hatten. Ganz erstaunt sei sie gewesen, als ein Franzose sich von ihr verabschiedete mit den Worten "Auf Wiedersehen Mademoiselle sowieso". Sie hätten sie mit einer Französin verwechselt. (147 words)

Ich habe irgendwann früher einmal das Bild abgenommen, weil zu viel an der Wand war und mir dies Bild des mir fremden Kindes sinnlos schien. Emme hatte das nur vergessen. Emme erzählte weiter, dies sei das Kind eines Verwandten gewesen. Ich bin sehr erstaunt: "Ich habe ja nie gewusst, dass der ein Kind hatte" - "Doch, er hat es aufgegessen. Er hatte damals den Wahn, alle Kinder aufessen zu müssen". - Ich: "Das ist ja furchtbar, davon habe ich gar nichts gewusst. Wie konnte denn das passieren?" - Emme erzählt nun eine Geschichte, wie es passiert sei, während man die Mutter - übrigens eine sehr tapferes Mädchen - geholt habe. Es war wohl im Krankenhaus. Ich wache völlig erschüttert und durcheinandergebracht auf und bin entsetzt . - Ps. Emme, spielte in dem Traum zugleich die Rolle meiner Schwester, als die, die damals dabei gewesen ist, sie trägt aber sonst ganz die Züge von Emme und ist Emme. Auch ist es mir im Traum garnicht als etwas Besonderes aufgefallen, dass sie hier zugleich als meine Schwerster ist. Schwester und Frau - ganz unreflektiert - hier wie die selbe Rolle. (227 words)

Wir suchten einen Raum, in dem wir uns ungestört unterhalten konnten, und fanden schliesslich einen rings an den Wänden mit Bücherregalen ausgefüllten Raum, der früher als Rektorat gedient hatte. Als wir dort sassen, kam ein Mann herein, den ich nach einigen Augenblicken als den Rektor erkannte. Er wollte sich sichtlich dort niederlassen. Der Raum gehörte also doch noch zum Rektorat, was aber Sonnemann nicht so schnell zu begreifen schien. Der Mann stand etwas unschlüssig, weil Sonnemann auf seinem Stuhl sass. Er fragte uns: "Wissen Sie, wie ich im Winter mit zweitem Namen heissen werde?" Wir wussten es nicht. Er nannte einen ungarischen Namen und übersetzte ihn gleich: Er hiess soviel wie "im Menschen", glaube ich. Sonnemann, dem glücklicher Weise der richtige Namen des Rektors (ein ungarischer Name, der schon aus zwei Worten bestand) einfiel, sagte: Sie sind doch Herr Professor sowieso. - Dieser bejahte.

Dann kam ein Mann, der ein Modell in fechtender Stellung brauchte. Ich verabredete mit ihm eine Sitzung. Einen ganzen Vormittag musste ich allein in einem Raum warten. Mittags ging ich fort (die Akademie lag etwas anders in den Strassen als in Wirklichkeit). Nachmittags musste ich bei einer Gruppe von Mädchen Modell stehen, die Menschen in tanzender Bewegung zeichnen wollten, oder selbst tanzen oder Gymnastik lernen wollten. Als ich kam, war noch eine Frau als Modell da, die nackt , oder mit nacktem Unterkörper - oben hatte sie, glaube ich, ein wehendes Kleid an - rhythmische Bewegungen machte. Ich hatte mir ganz schnell mein Hemd abgestreift und stand nun im schwarzen Unterhöschen da.- Sie genierte sich. (164 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2055 (1958-08-06 - Freiburg)Der neue Erzbischof wurde geweiht., Es war ein mir von Ansehen bekannter Theologieprofessor. Vorher ging ein langer Zuge - wohl durch die Stadt und mehrere grosse Räume, in deren einem ich mit vielen Zuschauern auf Bänken sass. Es kamen Messknaben, Herolde und allerlei Figuren in feierlichen Gewändern. Ich hörten wie diese Messknaben sagten: "Wer hält die Tür offen?" Es handelte sich um eine Tür, die aus dem langen Saal, in dem wir sassen, wieder heraufführte und durch die der Zug hindurch musste. Da ich merkten, dass niemand darauf reagierte, und mir dachte, dass die Messknaben schlecht stehen bleiben konnten, stand ich auf und hielt die Tür auf, wobei ich so o hinter die Tür an einer Seitenwand zu stehen kam, dass ich von ihr verdeckt war und , um den Zug zu sehen, seitlich zwischen Türrand und einem Vorhang hervorschauen musste. Ich hatte einen roten Parallelo an. Jetzt kam der Zug mit den Erzbischof in den feierlichen Gewändern in grosser Eile. gleichsam im Schnellschritt, wie um das Pensum noch rechtzeitig zu absolvieren, angelaufen Ich schaute solange hinter meiner offengehaltenen Tür hervor, wie ich den Bischof noch in mehr vagen Umrissen herankommen sah, und zog mich hinter die Tür zurück, als er so deutlich erschien, dass er auch mich sehen musste. Er ging aber nicht durch die geöffnete Tür, sondern schaute neugierig und eilig hinter die Tür, wo er irgendwas gesehen haben musste. Sein Gesicht zeigte Erstaunen und die Art von Entspannung, die solche Begegnungen innerhalb einer solch feierlichen Atmosphäre auslösen können, als er mich formlos hinter der Tür stehen sah. Es war zugleich die Begegnung mit einem Protestanten. (268 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2057 (1958-08-07 - Freiburg)In Schwerin. Ich gehe vom Pfafffenteich durch eine der Strassen, die mich früher von der Schule aus nach Hause geführt haben. Ich wähle einen Weg, den ich selten ging - nämlich durch die Kaiser-Wilhelm-Strasse, bei der man schliesslich im rechten Winkel in die Schlossstrasse abbiegend gleichsam im grossen Karrée geht, während die anderen Wege mehr im Zickzack gingen. ich schlendere durch diese Strasse. D er Verkehr gerät einmal ganz ins Stocken. Er wird fast ausschliesslich von Pferdefuhrwerken bestritten. E ist aber, wie ich weiter vorne sehe, kein ersichtlicher Grund für diese Stockung. Ich formuliere in Gedanken Sätze, die diese Stockung auf ein metaphysisches Ereignis zurückführen. Dabei schwingt auch der Gedanke mit, dass man in diesem Staat nicht von einer Verkehrsstockung reden sollte. An de Ecke zur Schlossstrasse steht ein Polizist in weisser Uniform, der den Verkehr ins s individueller Weise regelt. So kommt er mit fragendem Blick auf mich, den Fussgänger, zu. Ich gebe ihm mit einem Fingerzeig die gewünschte >Richtung nach links an , und er gibt meinen Weg nach links durch eine elegante Bewegung frei. Die ganze Begegnung mit dem Verkehrspolizisten hat etwas sehr persönliches. In meine neue Richtung führen zwei Strassen. die dicht nebeneinander münden. Es müssen die Schlossstrasse (die direkte Verbindung zur Schlossinsel, über die ich gehen muss, um nach Haus zu kommen) und die Klosterstrasse sein, die hinter dieser fast parallel läuft, aber stiller ist und etwas geheimnisvoller, und die ich auf dem Nachhauseweg oft mit dem Rad fuhr, weil sie glatten Asphalt hat. Aber ich finde einen anderen Strassennamen satt "Schlossstrasse". Irgend etwas mit "Burg" Offenbar hat man alle Namen, in denen das Wirt Schloss vorkam , aus politischen Gründen verändert. So gehe ich auf's Geratewohl, denn die Strassen sind vom Kriege her noch sehr zerstört (entspricht nicht der Wirklichkeit). Ich entdecke als Ruinen wunderbare Kirchen, die ich vorher im heilen Zustand - als Kind - nie gesehen hatte. So eine herrliche Westfassade und davor die R Ruine eines alten gotischen Tors mit gotischem Spitzbogen. Auch andere gotische Kirchen mit sehr feinen ziselierten Mauerstrukturen, die nur noch als Ruinen stehen. Dies alles ist mir neu. In die Trümmer alter Bürgerhäuser hat man neu, deren treppenartig ansteigende Firmen nachahmend, moderne Betonarchitektur gebaut, dabei sehr geschickt die massiven nördliche Firmen nachahmend und doch die Eigenart des Betons belassend. Dann entdecke ich linker Hand an seinem Platz die Masse des backsteingotischen Doms ganz unversehrt aufragen. Ich bin sehr angerührt von diesem Anblick. E Es ist sozusagen der Kern und das Herz der Stadt. Ich erwache und mir fällt die Melodie zu "Venite adoremus" ein. (427 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2058 (1958-08-08 - Freiburg)Ich entdeckte in dem Bodenverschlag neben unserem Zimmer eine Treppe, die in ein veritables grosses Zimmer herabführte. Daneben war noch ein zweites Zimmer, das also unter unserem sein musste. Hier stand ein grosses Buffet. Emme, die nun auch heruntergekommen war, betrachtete es genauer, es standen noch Butter und Käse darauf und Lebensmittel, aber uralt und ganz verschimmelt. Hier war seit langem nie jemand gewesen, und die Baumgärtnerin wusste wahrscheinlich gar nichts von der Existenz dieser Räume, die wohl in einer Art Zwischenboden sein mussten, über der unteren Etage, aber so hoch, dass es richtig wohnliche Zimmer waren. Ich überlegte im Erwachen, dass wir mit diesen Räumen zusammen eine richtige Drei-Zimmer-Wohnung haben würden. (112 words)

Dann vereinigten wir uns. - Später fand ich zu meinem Erschrecken allerlei zurückgelassene Sachen von ihr. Ich sass gerade in der Badewanne. Neben dem Bad stand eine aufgeschlagene Niveachremdose. Emme fragte: Chremst Du Dich im Bade? Ich erfand schnell eine Ausrede. Dann sah ich, als Emme gerade wieder weggegangen war, Inges schwarzen Badeanzug mit Spitzenrüschen ins Innere umgekehrt neben meiner Wanne liegen. Ein Mann, den sie wohl geschickt hat, kommt heran, um ihn zu holen. Ich flüstere ihm zu: "Tempo bitte", und er geht sehr gemessen mit dem Badeanzug von dannen, ohne dass Emme ihn gesehen hat. Dann stehe ich aus der Wanne auf und sehe nun ein kleines schwarzes Kästchen, vielleicht ein Safekästchen, neben der Wanne liegen, das sie ebenfalls vergessen hat.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2061 (1958-08-11 - Freiburg)Meldung im Radio: "Unbekannte fliegende Objekte, die von den Amerikanern abgeschossen werden, kreisen über der Renaissance und über der Riviera" (die Renaissance dabei ebenfalls Küstenbezeichnung für Cote d'Azur - fiel ,mir im Traum nicht auf). Später fahre ich im Zug durch diese Landschaft. Am Himmel ist eine ziemlich dichte Wolkendecke. Überall kreisen Flugzeuge und Hubschrauber, die offenbar die Flugobjekte zu umkreisen und zu photographieren suchen. Ich sage (wohl zu einem der Mitreisenden) "Die haben sich ein amüsantes Datum zu diesem Experiment ausgesucht. Es ist der 13., der 13. Mai". Ich überlege, dass man sagen wird, wenn die Experimente missglücken, es sei die böse 13 gewesen. Da taucht plötzlich in den Wolken ein kleines scheibenähnliches Ding in den Wolken auf und bewegt sich in grosser Geschwindigkeit in der Richtung auf uns zu. Man sieht, dass es sich in grosser Geschwindigkeit dabei um die eigene Achse dreht, und hört einen hellem sirrenden Ton, den es erzeugt (ähnlich wie die Funkzeichen der Erdsatelliten). Die Form ist, genau gesehen - es bewegt sich jetzt direkt über den Zug hinweg und muss gleich am Boden zerschellen - die einer Scheibe, die sich zu einem zylindrigen Gebilde verformt. Die Geschwindigkeit ist weit höher als die von Flugzeugen. Jetzt zerschellt es auf der anderen Seite des Zuges auf einem Acker am Boden. Ich nehme schnell gewohnheitsmässig auf dem Boden des Zuges Deckung . Aber es erfolgt keine Detonation. Nur eine Staubwolke steigt auf und die Teile fliegen auseinander. Innen scheint der Flugkörper leer zu sein. Er enthält nichts Explosives. Eine Menschenmenge, die sich sofort gesammelt hat, stürzt sich auf die Reste. Hoffentlich geht nichts verloren, denke ich. -Erwachen. (271 words)

Der Weg kreuzte eine Strasse mit viel Verkehr. Eine Frau mit zittrigem Hund stand am Rand. Ich nahm ihn. Ein Auto kam von de Strasse ab. Auf uns zu. Geriet vor uns über die Böschung und kam ins Rutschen. Den Abhang hinab. ich konnte es noch an der vorderen Stossstange fassen, kam nun aber durch das Gewicht des Autos selbst langsam ins Rutschen. Das Auto würde sich mehrfach überschlagen, wenn ich es losliesse. Der Insasse öffnete das Dach und kam sehr langsam heraus. Ich schrie ihn an: "Los, Los, Tempo, Tempo". Er beeilte sich jetzt und kam gerade noch im rechten Moment heraus, ehe ich das Übergewicht kriegte. Nun war das Auto leichter.

Das mit vielen Abbildungen von Kunstwerken versehene Buch war voller origineller Wendungen und Einfälle einer ironischen und tiefsinnigen Geschichtsbetrachtung, die besonders die Verkehrung eines geschichtlichen in sein Gegenteil als einen merkwürdigen Vorgang der Geschichte hervorhob. So wurde die Bedeutung des Wortes Edelmann abgeleitet von dem Schicksal eines zunächst Verfehmten, der zufällig den Namen Edelmann trug. Dieser war gekreuzigt und sollte nun, da er noch lebte, nach der Kreuzabnahme mit dem Schwert erschlagen werden.

Eine durchsichtige Scheibe hing so vor dem Kopf, dass es unmöglich war, weiter zu gehen, wenn man sie nicht in der Richtung auf sich selbst zurückklappte, wozu man einen Schritt zurücktreten musste, was schwierig war, weil hinter mir wieder andere Menschen kamen, die ebenfalls aus dem engen Gang heraus drängten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2070 (1958-08-25 - Nagold)Ein Mädchen spricht mich auf der Treppe - wohl der Universität - an und stellt sich vor mit dem Namen Gogarten. Sie hat die grossen blauen Augen ihres Vaters, sein offenes Gesicht und sehr schöne blonde Haare. Sie erzählt mir nun, sie schreibe eine psychologische Arbeit über die Asche-Zurückhalter beim Zigarettenrauchen, die Leute also, die ihre Asche möglichst lange nicht abstauben, sondern an der Zigarette zurückhalten, so dass sie lang stehen bleibt. Der Gedanke scheint mir sehr originell. Sie scheint noch mit einem Mann zusammen daran zu arbeiten, denn sie spricht von "wir". Während des Gesprächs bietet sie mir eine Zigarette an und beim Rauchen merke ich, wie ich unwillkürlich die Asche zurückhalte und lang werden lasse, um sie dann unmittelbar vor ihr ab zu stipsen. Mir wird dabei klar, was das gesteuerte Aschezurückhalten bedeutet. Es ist eine Art Potenzhortung (wobei Cigarette = Phallussymbol und Asche = Potenz. Die Asche-Verstreuer und die, die die Asche dauernd loswerden müssen, haben also etwas zu bedeuten). Ich frage sie darum, ohne ihr diese Gedanken mitzuteilen, ob sie das Thema mehr tiefenpsychologisch behandeln wolle oder mehr diagnostisch. Es scheint mir aus ihrer Antwort so, als ob sie es mehr diagnostisch-statistisch anpacken wolle - mit der heute üblichen etwas pedantischen Methode (Sie will die Arbeit wohl bei Heiss machen). Mir fällt nun auf. dass es die Schwierigkeit dann ist, einen Massstab für das Asche-Zurückhalten zu finden. Sie spricht auch schon von objektiven Kriterien und meint, man könne vielleicht eine "Seelen-Schnur" in die Cigarette einlassen. Ich sage: "Dann gibt es dauernd kleine Explosionen". Sie: "Nein nein, Seele ist eine Käseart". Ich: "Na, ob das der Raucher gerne riechen wird." Wir überlegen weiter, und ich wache mit diesem Gedanken auf und grüble noch eine Weile im Erwachen, wie man es machen könnte. Filmen, oder die herabgefallene Aschemenge messen, oder was sonst. Der Raucher darf es ja nicht merken. (311 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2071 (1958-08-26 - Stuttgart)Komme mit Emme und Dieter nach Hause. Wir müssen einen Berg hinauf. Da geht eine Schwebebahn. Oben an der Endstation müssen wir aussteigen. Ich steige zuletzt aus. Die Bahn schaukelt leicht. Gegenüber ist die Gartentür (die im Traum ist wie in Nagold). Zu unserem Leidwesen steht dort Besuch. Eine alte dicke französische Tante mit Pelzkappe und schwarz gekleidet (wie ältere Leute oft) und eine jüngere, ebenfalls schwarz Gekleidete. Emme geht mit der Alten voran. Ich folge mit der Jüngeren. Sie sagt irgend eine (wohl französische) Redensart, die ironisch etwa besagt: "Wir kommen nur auf einen ewigen Augenblick". (Der Sinn ist etwa so, die Formulierung anders. Statt des Wortes "ewig" war es ein anderes, das "lange Zeit" ausdrückt.) Die Haustür, die hinter dem Haus ist (man musste also und das Haus rum gehen), wurde irgendwie geöffnet. Dies ist offenbar Eberhards Werk, den ich plötzlich in einem aussen an der Hauswand angebrachten Gasbadeofen sitzen sehe. Ich schliesse diesen mit einem Schlüssel (wie einen Briefkasten) auf. Doch das Loch ist viel zu klein, als dass Eber hinauskönnte. Er ist völlig drinnen eingeklemmt. Ich fürchte, dass er ersticken könnte. Ich kann mir kaum vorstellen, wie er hereingekommen ist - vielleicht in einem Deliriums-artigen Zustand. Ich wache mit grosser Angst und der Überlegung auf, dass man ein Unfallkomando holen müsste.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2073 (1958-08-28 - Nagold)Ich blättere in einer Mappe voller sehr schöner Stiche oder Holzschnitte von Picasso, die alle in der Bewegung etwas Barockes haben. Einen davon, den ich jetzt wiedererkenne, habe ich früher schon einmal Gisela geschenkt. In ihm ist das Barocke - aber in der Picasso eigenen Verwandlung und Durchdringung - besonders ausgeprägt. Ich lege ihn auch diesmal zuerst heraus und suche dann weitere aus, die mir besonders gut gefallen, bis etwa die fünf schönsten bei Seite liegen, die ich nun kaufen will. Ich halte es für Kunstdruckblätter, die nicht viel kosten werden, doch nun erfahre ich, dass es Originalabzüge sind, von denen jeder drei Mark kostet. Darum kann ich nicht alle kaufen und erwache mit der Überlegung, wie ich wählen soll. (120 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2074 (1958-08-29 - Nagold)Wir fuhren mit der Eisenbahn. Ich hatte den Kinderwagen mit Bettina in irgend einem Eisenbahnwagen abgestellt, und wir waren weiter nach vorne in andere Wagen gegangen, wohl um bessere Plätze zu suchen. Dann fuhr der Zug los. Ich ging in dem Zug (der Verbindungen zwischen den Wagen hatte) nach hinten, um den Kinderwagen nachzuholen. Doch entdeckte ich diesen nicht. Plötzlich sah ich ihn draussen ausserhalb des Eisenbahnwagens, nur ganz leicht am Griff festgeklemmt, mit dem Kind drin schweben. Ich suchte nach einer "Notbremse". Eine Schaffnerin in der Nähe griff nach dieser. Es war eine schon ältere Frau. Ich rief ihr zu, dass der Kinderwagen draussen schwebe, während ich zur Tür lief. In diesem Moment hielt der Zug zufällig sowieso gerade. Die Schaffnerin sagte: "Dann zieh ich die Notbremse nur, wenn er wieder anfährt" Ich rief : "Dann ist es schon zu spät. Durch den Ruck beim Anfahren kann der Wagen herunterfallen". Inzwischen hatte ich die Tür erreicht - alles vorherige hatte sich in Sekundenschnelle abgespielt -, stieg aus und rannte, so schnell ich konnte, auf den Nebenschienen zum Kinderwagen, der nur ganz leicht am Zug festhing. Vielleicht hatte ihn jemand auf den Bahnsteig gestellt, und, als er Zug aus der Station fuhr, war der Kinderwagen, der quer zu ihm stand, mit dem Griff festgeklemmt und schwebte nun, wo der Bahnsteig fehlte, über den Geleisen. Dies alles dachte ich blitzschnell, während ich mit äusserster Kraft auf den Wagen zu lief, denn jeden Moment konnte der Zug anfahren und der Wagen herunterfallen, oder ein Gegenzug kommen und ihn wegreissen. Ich riss den Wagen herab und trug ihn ganz schnell zur nächsten Eingangstür, wo ich ihn hineinschob, und erwachte. Im Erwachen überlegte ich noch, was ich gemacht hätte, falls in diesem Moment ein Gegenzug gekommen wäre. Ich hätte das Kind hinaus nehmen und mich zwischen den beiden Geleisen mit ihm auf den Boden legen müssen. (312 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2077 (1958-09-01 - Nagold)Traum, dessen Handlung gleichzeitig die Geschichte eines Kriminalromans war, und zwar so, dass die hier wirklich geschehene Handlung genau so festgelegt war wie der Ausgang eines Kriminalromans, von dem man ja weiss, dass er schon geschrieben ist, so dass man getrost die Lösung der Rätsel abwarten kann. So konnte man hier den schon feststehenden Gang der Ereignisse abwarten (wie bei einer vollendeten Prädetermination). Es handelte sich um einen Mord durch Vergiften. Jemand, der in einem Haus wohnte, um das herum der Traum spielte, hatte einen Menschen vergiftet, und mit dem selben Gift waren dabei eine Reihe von Fischen vergiftet. Beides, die Leiche des Menschen und die toten Fische, musste er also entweder verstecken oder vernichten, ohne dass es auffiel. Den Menschen steckte er in eine Kornpuppe. Die Fische zu verstecken, machte ihm mehr Schwierigkeiten, denn es waren eine ganze Menge. Er fragte, ob er sie nicht einfach in das Fischbecken werfen sollte, das sich neben seinem Hause befand und in dem noch viele Fische waren, so dass es aussah, als ob diese gestorben wären. Ich riet ihm davon ab, denn wenn der Mord einmal herausgekommen wäre, würde man alles durchkämmen und dabei auch die toten Fische finden und analysieren, und dann würde er die Herkunft des Giftes in den toten Fischen nicht erklären können und sich dadurch verraten. Es ist ja so merkwürdig, wie in der Umgebung eines Mordes jede Bagatelle wichtig wird und herauskommen kann. - Inzwischen kam aber durch einen merkwürdigen Zufall auch das Versteck der Leiche ans Licht, oder war kurz davor. Denn ein Mann in der Umgebung - wohl ein Feriengast und, wie es schien, sogar mit dem Mörder befreundet, denn er duzte ihn - hatte die merkwürdige Angewohnheit, aus Kraftprotzerei Kornpuppen in die Höhe zu werfen. Diesem fiel nun eines Tages auf, dass da eine so viel schwerer war als die anderen, und ich erlebte gerade, wie er den Mann fragte, wie es komme, dass seine Kornpuppe so viel schwerer war als die anderen hier. - Wie würde er sich aus der Affäre ziehen? Was würde der antworten? Was würde er mit den Fischen machen? Und wo wollte er überhaupt letzten Endes die Leiche hinbringen? Und würde alles eines Tages rauskommen, oder nie? So fragte ich mich. Aber man konnte ja abwarten. Die Handlung stand ja fest. Es war ja ein Kriminalroman. Hier brach der Traum, glaube ich, ab. Das Geschehen im Traum war übrigens ganz unbelastet von moralischen Gesichtspunkten. Es ging nur darum, ob das Geheimnis gewahrt bleiben konnte oder das Verbrechen ans Licht kommen wie im Kriminalroman. (424 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2079 (1958-09-03 - Nagold)Verwickelter Traum. Zum Teil in merkwürdigen Wohnverhältnissen, dicht oberhalb des Wassers. In der Nacht drohte ein Sturm alle in Ampeln aufgehängten Blumentöpfe ins Wasser zu fegen. Zum Teil war die Wohnung bohèmienhaft. Dann spielte auch mein "Käfig" hinein. Ich hörte, dass schon verschiedene Leute Darstellungen über diese originelle Bude geschrieben und veröffentlicht hatten, darunter auch ein Pater, wohl ein Holländer oder Belgier. Dann eine Freundin von Hf., die sich vor mir nackt auszog. Wir umarmten uns. Sie war sehr schön. Dann in einem Schuhgeschäft. Die Mieter jener merkwürdigen Wohnung hatten sich, zu Dekorationszwecken, aus sehr vielen Schuhkartons je einen Schuh genommen. Die mussten jetzt wieder in die richtigen Kartons zurück gebracht werden. Es waren sehr schöne Schuhe, meist in hellem Leder und in sehr organischen Formen, die schön an den nackten Fuss gepasst hätten. Die Frau, die den Laden besass, schien zu glauben, dass ich an der Verwirrung des Schuhe schuld sei - vielleicht, weil es die selben Leute waren, die auch über meinen Käfig geschrieben hatten. Ich machte ihr klar, dass es ihre Untermieter seien. Die Wohnungen waren nämlich über diesem Laden. Alle Verhältnisse in dem Traum waren sehr verwickelt. Ich erinnere nur noch Bruchstücke. Der ganze Traum hatte etwas Faszinierendes - wie die schwebende Atmosphäre in einem warmen Bade. (211 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2081 (1958-09-05 - Freiburg)Traum. Angsttraum: Verkehrsunfall, der sich aber - was mir im Traum garnicht als besonders auffiel -nicht auf der Strasse, sondern in der Wohnung abspielte. - Es muss also so gewesen sein, als ob die Welt in die Wohnung gekommen sei, vielleicht im Kino, ich kann das Traumerlebnis nicht mehr ganz rekonstruieren -: Ein Zug und ein Auto waren zusammengefahren. Das Auto war unter dem Zug begraben, beide einen Abhang hinunter gestürzt. Man konnte noch nicht sagen, ob es Tote gegeben hatte. Ich rannte aus dem Haus über die Strasse zu einer Telephonzelle - wobei ich eine Passantin, die mir im Weg stand , einfach wegschob, wozu ich durch den Verkehrsunfall berechtigt zu sein glaubte. Einen Mann, der die Telephonzelle gerade gleichzeitig mit mir betreten wollte, drängte ich zurück, indem ich mich vor ihn drängte und etwas von Unfall murmelte. Ich war furchtbar aufgeregt. Meine Groschen fielen mir zu Boden. Dann fiel mir ein, dass man beim Unfallruf gar keine Groschen brauche. Einer rollte aus der Zelle auf die Strasse. Dann konnte ich die Nummer auf dem Schild nicht behalten. Dann konnte ich die Zahlen auf der Wählscheibe, die merkwürdig stilisiert waren, nicht lesen und musste die Löcher in der Scheibe einfach auszählen. Es fiel mir auf, wie hier in der Aufregung alles schwierig wird, was man sonst selbstverständlich kann. Schliesslich hatte ich die Nummer gewählt, es war eine dreistellige Zahl, die mit einer 1 begann, wie 113, und das Weckzeichen ertönte im Hörer. Nun fiel mir ein, dass ich garnicht genau wusste, wo in der Strasse, die Wilhelmstrasse hiess und mit der Freiburger Wilhelmstrasse identisch war, ich eigentlich war. Man konnte ja den Unfall von der Strasse aus nicht sehen, da er in der Wohnung war. Ich musste also den Ort genau beschreiben. -: Bei der Zelle eine Querstrasse, deren Namen ich aber nicht kannte. Mit diesen Überlegungen wachte ich auf. - Starkes Herzklopfen. (314 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2082 (1958-09-08 - Freiburg)Mehrfach geträumt, dass Dag Hammerskjöld mein Zimmer sehen wolle. ich wohnte in einem grossen Schloss, in dem Hammerskjöld, der Generalsekretär der Uno, offenbar all Zimmer besichtigte. Das Mädchen - es war die Bedienung aus St. Valentin, die uns schon seit langem kennt, und die im Traum zu dem Schloss gehörte, kündigte mir den Besuch an. Mein Zimmer war aber sehr unaufgeräumt. Der Inhalt der Koffer lag noch auf Betten und Tischen verteilt, und vor allem standen noch die ungeputzten Schuhe auf dem Boden (während bei anderen Zimmern die Schuhe bereits geputzt vor der Tür standen), weil ich dem Mädchen das im Schloss die Schuhe putzte, verboten hatte, die meinen zu putzen, weil ich es ihm nicht zutraute und es selber machen wollte. das war ein Fehler. Ich hatte nun gehofft, sie würde es inzwischen doch heimlich tun. Das war aber ein Irrtum. Ich sagte aber zu dem anderen Mädchen, die schon überlegte, wie sie Hammerskjöld an meinem Zimmer vorbeiführen könnte, sie solle ihn doch ruhig hereinführen. Ich dachte mir, ich würde schon noch die grösste Unordnung bei Seite schaffen, und sagte, ein bisschen Unordnung zu sehen, würde ihm gar nichts schaden. (191 words)

Wir sassen mit ihr und Mields am Tisch und plauderten. Mields machte eine heimliche Tonbandaufnahme. Brigitte Bardot merkte es aber sehr bald und zog lachend unter dem Tisch den Stöpsel heraus. Sie erzählte von einem Mann, der ihr immer schrieb und dem sie immer antworte: "So kannst Du mich nicht haben". Dieser wollte sie nämlich heiraten. Das ganze Gespräch war locker, sehr heiter und sehr verspielt. In einer anderen Szene wollte ich zu Fuss durch eine grosse Stadt gehen, durch eine Strasse, die "Fünfte Strasse" hiess und zum Bahnhof führen sollte. Ein Polizist wollte mir eine andere Strasse, bzw. die Strassenbahn, vorschlagen, ich war aber entschlossen, diese Strasse zu gehen. (154 words)

Vorhergegangen waren andere Szenen, die von Verkehrsunfall handelten. Ein sehr tüchtiger Mann löste alle Probleme. Er imponierte mir sehr. Wir waren in der Wohnung eines schrulligen alten Fräuleins. Ein alter Nachttisch aus dem Jahre 1670 fesselte meine Aufmerksamkeit. Hier kam es zum Kuss. Inge lächelte, als ich nach ihrem Kopf griff. Nachdem ich lange widerstanden hatte. Ich sagte: "Du bist ein Biest" - Dann kam der Kuss. Sie schob ihre Zunge zwischen meine Lippen. Ich dachte noch während des Kusses: Wie soll es weitergehen? Können wir hier aufhören? Vorher andere Traumszene. Ein Haus bei einem Kanal mit einer Seufzerbrücke. Von da ging es wohl in das Haus des schrulligen Fräuleins über. Zwischen dem Zimmer, wo wir waren und ihrem war ein Aufzug, durch dessen Ritze das Licht durchschimmerte, als bei uns der Strom einmal unterbrochen war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2090 (1958-09-20 - Freiburg)Ich ging durch die Stadt, durch die Strassen in ost-westlicher Richtung, um Besorgungen zu machen. In der Salzstrasse war der Boden bis in grosse Tiefe und in ganzer Breite aufgerissen. Es mussten sehr umwälzende Strassenarbeiten hier gemacht werden. Ich sah am anderen Ende der aufgerissenen Grube, dass diese die Tiefe der Höhe eines Hauses hatte und sorgfältig abgestützt war. Ich dachte zuerst, ich würde am Rande entlang einen Weg finden. Hier war auch eine Art Holzsteg angefangen, aber er führte nicht ganz zu mir heran, und ich musste fürchten, mit der Erdmasse am Rande abzurutschen. Gearbeitet wurde nicht. Es war Nacht. Ich kehrte um und beschloss, in einer Parallelstrasse meinen Weg zu suchen, um so doch noch in das gesuchte Geschäft zu kommen (das wohl am Ende der Salzstrasse war). Ich konnte entweder versuchen, nördlich in die Schusterstrasse zu gelangen, oder südlich in die Grünwälderstrasse, die beide zur Salzstrasse parallel laufen. Als ich mich umgewandt hatte, hörte ich ein Auto herankommen, das wohl an eines der neben mir liegenden Häuser heranfahren wollte. Man konnte mich nicht sehen, weil ich von einer Haustreppe verdeckt wurde. Ich musste fürchten, von dem Auto angefahren zu werden, das hier - in der zur Sackgasse gewordenen Einbahnstrasse - keinen Verkehr mehr zu befürchten brauchte. Ich entschloss mich, nicht zurück zu gehen, da nirgendwo ein recht schutzbringender Winkel zu entdecken war, sondern einige Schritte vorzuspringen - in Richtung auf das ankommende Auto, um noch vor ihm die Stufen der vorragenden Haustreppe zu erreichen. Dies gelang mir auch - im selben Moment, als das Auto seitlich vorfuhr und zwei Herren ausstigen, die ebenfalls die Treppe betraten (sie schien zu einer Art Sparkasse zu führen), während ich die Stufen auf der anderen Seite wieder herabstieg und nun nach rechts, also nach Süden einbog, weil in dieser Richtung sich die Strasse zuerst öffnete. Es ist dies der Platz (Augustinerplatz, aber im Traum ein wenig anders), auf den mehrere parallele Strassen oder Gassen münden. In der obersten, der Grünwälderstrasse, sah ich vor dem schwarzen Nachthimmel mitten auf der Strasse ein hinten offenes Lieferauto stehen, in dem eine Frau lag. Es war unheimlich, und ich beschloss, diese Strasse nicht zu wählen. Es war jetzt ausgesprochen Nacht und hier dunkler als in der Salzstrasse. Im Umdrehen erkannte ich - an ihrer Lage -, dass die Frau eine Schwangere sein musste, die von ihrem Mann zur Klinik gebracht wurde. Ich sah dann auch einen besorgt sich bewegenden Mann um den Wagen herumlaufen. Im Weitergehen erwachte ich. (413 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2091 (1958-09-24 - Freiburg)Ich höre einen Schrei, laufe hinaus und sehe vor der Tür eine Kinderleiche. Ein Mord ist geschehen. Andere ähnliche waren hier schon vorher her passiert. Gleichzeitig höre ich in der Ferne das Hauses ein pochendes Geräusch wie von schellen S Schritten. Ich stürze hinterher dem Geräusch nach - durch das lang hingezogene Haus. Am anderen Ende ist noch ein zweites Treppenhaus. Am Fuss der Treppe sitzt ein junger Handwerker. Hier muss der Mörder vorbei gekommen sein. Aber er hat nichts gesehen. Ich höre immer noch das pochende Geräusch von schnellen S Schritten, stürze die Treppe r rauf auf den Dachboden, wo die Geräusche herkommen. Doch oben ist niemand, nur ein Hund kommt mir entgegen, ein gepflegter russischer Setter. Da wird es mir blitzartig klar: Der Hund muss der Mörder sein. Er muss das Kind totgebissen haben. So muss es auch in den früheren Fällen schon gewesen sein. - Mit dieser Theorie wache ich langsam auf - schlafe nach einigem Überlegen wieder ein und träume nun, wie ich den Hund in einen fest verschlossenen Käfig bringe, weil ich mich scheue, ihn zu töten. Als Käfig benütze ich einen Hühnerstall, nachdem ich die Hühner vorher hinausgejagt habe. (195 words)

Er kam noch einmal zurück, um mich zu begrüssen. Ich hatte meine Sandalen in der Tasche und stand barfuss da. Um ihm entgegenzugehen, stellte ich schnell die Sandalen auf den Boden, um hinein zu schlüpfen, und war damit fertig, aber noch gebückt, als er kam. Ich sagte: "Ich muss nur schnell in meine Schuhe reinschlüpfen". Er antwortete: "Wünsche Ihnen sehr, dass Sie reinkommen, wünsche Ihnen sehr, dass Sie reinkommen - in die junge Generation." Er hatte also offenbar garnicht verstanden, was ich meinte. - Zwei weniger deutliche Szenen waren vorhergegangen: Erstens: Fahrt nach Herdern einen sehr steilen Berg hinauf in einer Strassenbahn, die wegen der Steilheit nicht stehen bleiben durfte. Dabei war es schwierig, den Autos auszuweichen, ohne ganz stehen zu bleiben. Es war, als wenn ich selbst am Führerstand stände. - In einer zweiten Szene war ich ausgestiegen und stand im Dunklen in Herdern, zuerst mit einem Fahrrad, mit dem ich eine sehr verkehrsreiche Strasse überqueren musste, dann bei einer Strassenbahnhaltestelle und musste die Leute fragen nach dem Weg zum "Kreutzbergplatz bei der Herden-Kirche".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2096 (1958-09-27 - Freiburg)Ein Friedhof mit altertümliche Grabsteinen. Wir - das heisst irgendein Begleiter und ich - liessen uns irgendwo zwischen den Gräbern nieder. Hinter uns waren Hügel mit umgestürzten und zum Teil zerbrochenen Grabkreuzen und Steinen mit alten Ornamenten. Ich kletterte zwischen ihnen herum, um eventuell ein schönes altes Ornament zu finden. Um mich besser bewegen zu können, hatte ich meine Sandalen abgestreift und stieg barfuss zwischen den Gräbern umher. Schliesslich fand ich ein sehr schönes altes Wappen, das aber noch mit grossen Teilen des Steins zusammen hing. Nach oben ragte noch das ganze Kreuz daran. Ich trug schliesslich das ganze Stück weg, um es Emme zu zeigen, die irgendwie auch da war, und es dann zurück zu legen. Inzwischen kam aber eine Grabgesellschaft auf der Rückkehr von einem Grab - einer Beerdigung - dort vorbei und wurde von ihrem Führer gerade zwischen uns und unserer Lagerstelle entlang geführt. Ich musste darum mit meinem Grabsteinstück, das ich gerade einigermassen tragen konnte, etwas seitwärts gehen und geriet nun ganz auf andere Wege, die mich von meinem Ziel eher wegführten. Ich musste kreuz und quer durch den merkwürdig und parkartig angelegten Friedhof gehen. Vorbei an einer grossen zentralen Begräbniskapelle - durch kreuzartig mit Brücken übereinander geführte Wege. Der Stein wurde immer schwerer. Ich ging immer noch barfuss. Inzwischen wurde es Nacht. Der Friedhof, der nun zugleich wie eine Kirche war, sollte geschlossen werden. Ein Wächter kam mit Schlüsseln, hatte aber keine Lampe. Unser Platz war in der Nähe des Altars. Ich konnte mich aber nicht zurecht finden. Suchte meine Sandalen. Der Wärter führte mich zu einem Schrank im Glauben, sie wären dort, liess mich dann allein. - Mein Begleiter kam wieder mit einem Photoapparat und Stativ, aber wieder ohne Lampe. Er zeigte mir vage den Platz, stürzte aber zum Ausgang. Er hatte Angst, eingeschlossen zu werden. Ich war allein - immer noch barfuss - und erwachte. (312 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2097 (1958-09-27 - Freiburg)Mitten in der Grossstadt in Hamburg an einer Kreuzung, wo viele Strassen schräg zueinander verlaufen. Ich habe die Orientierung verloren und das Gefühl der Ungeborgenheit. Mir begegnet ein junger Mann, der mich bekannt anspricht. Er denkt, dass ich noch zur Schule gehe, weil ich in Sandalen und kurzen Hosen sehr viel jünger wirke. Ich mache ihm klar, dass ich schon studiert habe, dass ich aber jetzt hier in Hamburg die Orientierung verloren habe, und beschreibe ihm ungefähr den Platz meines Geburtshauses am Grindel, dort wo jetzt die Hochhäuser stehen. Er weiss Bescheid. Ich frage ihn, woher wir uns kennten, er komme mir bekannt vor. Er antwortet: "Natürlich kennen wir uns" und nennt sogar meinen Namen. Wir kennen uns aus einer konfessionellen Umgebung. Und er beginnt nun etwas vom Kirchenkampf zu schwärmen - in einer etwas kämpferischen protestantischen Art. Als ich ihm klar mache, dass ich gar nicht mehr Theologie studiere, ist er etwas enttäuscht. Dann wechselt die Szene. Ich bin nun wirklich in einer Kirche. Aber in einer katholischen. Alle Menschen sitzen und knien hier barfuss. Ihre Sandalen stehen zwischen den Bänken. Ich fühle mich hier - selber barfuss - irgendwie geborgen und zu Hause. Vor der Bank - es ist die vorderste eines Seitenschiffes - steht im freien Mittelschiff ein zweirädriger Wagen mit einem schwarzen Tuch darüber, als ob eine kleine Leiche darauf sei. Aber unter dem Tuch bewegt sich etwas und zuckt. Es muss ein Kind sein, vielleicht ein sterbendes Kind oder eine Kinderleiche, die noch zuckt. Ein Priester fährt den Wagen vor einen hinten gelegenen Altar, während das Interesse der Gemeinde auf den vorne sich abspielenden Gottesdienst konzentriert ist. Nur die Umsitzenden oder Knienden sehen es. Der Wagen steht jetzt aber schief und das unter dem Tuch Liegende droht herabzustürzen. Ich gehe barfuss hin, um den Wagen gerade zu richten. Der Priester kommt dazu und ist mir dankbar. Ich sage zu ihm: "Sonst wäre etwas herunter gefallen". Er antwortet ebenso geheimnisvoll: "Das darf nicht herunterfallen". Ich gehe wieder zu den Bänken zurück, wo auch meine Sandalen stehen. Ein Mädchen mit langen aufgelösten blonden Haaren, Tränen in den Augen und wunderschönen schmalen nackten Füssen kuckt mich innig an und fragt: "Haben Sie Ihre Sandalen wieder gefunden?" Sie spielt damit auf die Szene auf dem Friedhof an, wo ich meine Sandalen suchen musste (siehe vorigen Traum 2096 !) Ich bejahe und setze mich neben sie. Die anderen Gläubigen haben sich jetzt umgedreht und schauen zu einem hinten im Seitenschiff stehenden Altar. Sie bleiben mit den Blick nach vorne. Das ganze Geschehen in der Kirche ist eine vielgliedrige und in vielem Dimensionen orientierte Handlung. - Später in einer anderen Szene gehe ich eine Treppe runter und begegne noch mal einem barfüssigen Mädchen.

Bei Tage aber war es mehr eine Familien-Angelegenheit. Ich war bei der Frau des Hauses, einer Tante in buntem Blumenkleid, die von lauter ebensolchen Besucherinnen umgeben war, zu Gast. Die Vernünftigste in dieser hausbackenen Umgebung war noch eine nur englisch sprechende Amerikanerin, die mich fragte, ob ich in Burkheim oder Kärnten sei. Offenbar kannte sie nur diese beiden Namen in Europa richtig. Als sie fortgegangen war, fragte man mich etwas ironisch, ob ich sie vermisse. Dabei war ich nur noch auf das mir mühsame Englisch-Sprechen konzentriert. Später war dann dort die Dorfbevölkerung und ich ging in mein Zimmer. Zu meinem Erstaunen kannten mich die Dorfleute und grüssten mich ehrerbietig. (128 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2102 (1958-09-29 - Freiburg)Das Haus war merkwürdig verbaut. Die Baumgärtnerin war ins Parterre gezogen in ein ihrem "Grünen Zimmer" entsprechend gelegenes Zimmer, das sie mir zeigte. Es war merkwürdig unregelmässig in den Formen und Massen, hatte überall schiefe Winkel. Dann öffnete sie aber eine Tür, anscheinend zu einem Erker, wodurch das Zimmer wieder leichter und ausgewogener wirkte. Ich sagte: "Diese Tür würde ich immer offen lassen". Sie: "O, Nein!" Ich sah nun oben in dem Raum des Erkers ein Gitter umlaufen und sagte: "Der hat ja sogar eine Galerie". - Sie: "Nein, das ist eine Treppe, die in die obere Etage führt. Sie ist sogar nicht mal verschlossen. Der Postbote benutzt diese manchmal". Ich sah nun den Postboten unten irgendwo hereinkommen und zu den Bewohnern der oberen Etage über diese Treppe heraufsteigen. Der Anbau war geräumig und kreisrund. Er musste sinnvoll gewesen sein, solange das Haus noch von einer Familie bewohnt wurde und der Herr des Hauses hier über die Treppe vielleicht in sein Arbeitszimmer herab steigen konnte. Ich ging dann hinaus und wollte, obwohl es schon herbstlich kühl war - aber trocken -, in meinen leichten Sandalen mit nackten Füssen in die Stadt gehen. Der Boden war so glatt, dass der Fuss sich darin spiegelte. Dann musste ich aber noch einmal ins Haus zurück, um die Sandalen zu holen, denn ich hatte nur meine ähnlichen, aber zu leichten Hausschuhe an. Ich ging durch den herrschaftlichen Haupteingang, wo mir zwei Leute begegneten, die zu Gisela wollten, die auch hier wohnte. Sie stiessen furchtbare aber lächerlich wirkende Anklagen gegen Gisela aus, die mir sehr wirr schienen. Ich versprach, sie zu bestellen, weil Gisela nicht da war, konnte aber nur die Namen Bölhof und Richard behalten, die mir nichts sagten. - Dann kam ich in Giselas Zimmer, über dem das meine gelegen war. Hier entdeckte ich zwischen beiden eine runde Einstiegsluke, die vom oberen in das untere herabführte. Sie war mit allerlei Gerümpel verstopft. Das räumte ich weg und öffnete sie, Gisela zum Tort. Ich konnte hier gerade hindurchschlüpfen. Zwischendurch - oder vorher - war irgendwie eine Szene in einer Bar, die ähnlich verbaut war. Man konnte sich hier Schnellimbisse kaufen. Ich ging gleichzeitig mit Enke durch die Tür, der den Verkäuferinnen gerne seine Komplexe erzählen wollte, was diese garnicht hören wollten. An mich dagegen schmiegten sie sich an und schoben ihr Knie so, dass ich darauf sitzen konnte. Es waren nette, eigentlich unproblematische Mädchen. Eine ganz andere Szene war wohl vor allen diesen vorher gegangen. Ich war mit Emme in Russland. Wir besichtigten ein merkwürdiges Haus, das als Museum diente. In einem Zimmer war viel ländliches Volk, das andere war ganz manieristisch eingerichtet. An der Wand hing ein riesiges Bild von einem Totenschädel in blassen fahlen Farben, vor dem an einer Schnur eine Attrappe eines Totenschädels rhythmisch auf und ab wippte (wie die als Schaukel gebildeten Perpendikel mancher Schwarzwalduhren, die nicht in der Waagerechten schwingen, sondern in der Senkrechten, wohl mit einer Feder). Der Eindruck, den dieses Bild machte, war sehr ungeheuer. In dem Zimmer, das mit alten, sehr kunstvollen, aber merkwürdigen Möbeln vollgestopft war, war ein fliessend deutsch sprechender Führer, der mir heimlich - auf einen einzelnen Schrank weisend - sagte: "Dies war der Schrank von meinem Vater", und so noch bei mehreren Sachen auf seinen Vater aufmerksam machte. Es war offenbar ein vornehmer Russe aus der früher herrschenden Gesellschaft, der sein Leben jetzt als Fremdenführer im ehemals eigenen Haus fristen musste. (569 words)

Als ich sie langsam hoch hob und das Gesicht sichtbar wurde, wie bei jemandem, der sich im Liegestütz aufrichtet, merkte ich, dass sie ganz ähnlich aussah wie Bettina, wenn sie sich so in den Liegestütz aufrichtet, nachdem sie zuvor auf dem Bauch im Bett gelegen hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2111 (1958-10-17 - Freiburg)Ich hatte einen Apparat zum Filmvorführern in unserer Stube und projizierte damit einen Film an die weisse Wand, zuerst wohl eine Vor- oder Wochenschau. Aber irgend etwas mit der Leichtquelle des Apparats war nicht in Ordnung. Viele der Bilder wurden ganz blau und kaum sichtbar - vor allem gerade die, die ich gerne genau sehen wollte, weil sie wenig bekleidet Mädchen zeigten. ich drehte ziemlich viel an dem Apparat. Ab und zu kamen deutlichere Bilder, aber gerade die schönen Szenen waren wieder blass. Ich sass mit dem Apparat auf Emmes Bett, während diese auf meinem Bett in der er dunklen Ecke gegenüber lag, so dass die Bilder auf die Wand über sie projiziert wurden. Dann wechselte die Szene. Ich war mit Emme und unserer Emmi in dem Zimmer. Ich bekam mit ihnen Streit und wollte die Tür zu knallen. Zu meinem Vergnügen stellte ich fest, dass neben der Tür in der er Ecke, wo sonst Billes Kleider sind, noch eine zweite Tür unmittelbar neben der gewohnten war. Auf diese Weise konnte ich immer durch die eine Tür gehen und die andere gleichzeitig zuschlagen. Ich tat dies schnell und ruckartig mehrfach hintereinander, wie man eine Pauke schlägt. (196 words)

Bekam das Geld nicht zurück. - Unter Vorwand. Merkte aber noch nichts, weil einer von ihnen verkleidet als Polizist auftrat. Waren sympathische Leute. Kam in die Wohnung zu ihnen mit Emme. Filmschauspielerinnen waren darunter. Ich hielt die Männer zum Teil mit den Händen fest, nachdem ich sie überführt hatte. Dann kam das Mädchen wieder. Es hatte kurze, hoch ausgeschnittene weite Pluderhosen an und wunderschöne frei geschwungene Oberschenkel. Sie ging mit gesenktem Haupt und züchtigem Blick. Ich sagte ihr ihre Betrügereien auf den Kopf zu. Ich überlegte, ob ich die Polizei rufen sollte, um die ganze Bande auffliegen zu lassen, zog es aber vor, durch eine Drohung zu versuchen, mein Geld noch zu bekommen. - Szenenwechsel: In der Universität in einem Gang vor dem Rektorat: Ich hatte in einem Aufsatz oder Klausur die zuvor erlebten Vorgänge beschrieben und wartete nun mit Anderen, auch das Mädchen war darunter, auf die Rückgabe der Arbeiten. Es hiess, ich solle zur persönlichen Rücksprache darüber hereinkommen. Ich bekam kurz das Heft in die Hand und wollte nachsehen, was für eine Note darin stand. Die Sekretärin entriss es mir aber. Das Betrügermädchen, die ja in dieser Szene zu den Studentinnen gehörte, fragte mich nach der Note, und ich konnte ihr nur sagen, dass ich das Heft nicht mehr hätte. Dann bekam ich es aber doch wieder in die Hand, schlug es auf und las - mit rotbrauner Kreide auf den blauen Deckel geschrieben - die Worte: "Mangelhaft. Worthandlungen. Persönlich. Schwiser." Schwiser war der Name des Beurteilenden. Persönlich sollte heissen, dass ich zu einer Rücksprache kommen sollte. Ich war ungeheuer empört. Was ich berichtet hatte, hatte ich alles wirklich erlebt. Diese Note fand ich eine Unverschämtheit. Ich erwachte sehr erregt. (296 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2113 (1958-10-20 - Freiburg)Festgesellschaft, Todesgesellschaft, Geheimgesellschaft. Diese drei kamen nacheinander durch unser Treppenhaus. Zuerst die Festgesellschaft. Die Mädchen hatten trotz des schon kalten Wetters nackte Füsse, an denen sie nur ganz leichte Pantoletten trugen, und zum Teil sehr schöne ganz schmale Fesseln und herrlich schlanke Füsse und schöne Festkleider. Diese Gesellschaft, die ich von oben, von unserem Rand des Treppengeländers aus sah, flutete in Lotzens Wohnung herein, so dass ich die Füsse der Mädchen von hinten sah, wenn ihre Oberkörper schon nicht mehr sichtbar waren, weil sie vom Rand der Zwischendecke verdeckt wurden. - Als nächstes kam die Todesgesellschaft. Es waren lauter schwarz gekleidete Leute, zum Teil mit sehr feinen Gesichtern. Diese ging die Treppe hinab. Aber, wo sie herkamen, konnte ich nicht feststellen. Auch die Leiche konnte ich nicht sehen, - dann kam die dritte Gesellschaft, Leute einer Geheimgesellschaft, die der SS. nahe standen, oder mit ihr identisch waren, die Treppe rauf zu uns. Sie wollten Herrn Roguszka verhaften oder etwas ähnliches und sprachen vorher mit mir. Dabei konnten sie ihren alten eingewurzelten SS-Gewohnheiten nicht widerstehen. Während der Anführer mit mir sprach, stiess mir einer der Schergen in die Seite oder schlug mich auf den Kopf und ähnliches. Ich verwahrte mich entschieden dagegen, obwohl das gefährlich war. Dann war diese Szene auch irgendwie vorbei und ich wartete im Zimmer auf Emme und die Kinder. Dann wachte ich auf, träumte aber weiter, dass ich diesen Traum aufschriebe und mit den Worten begann: "Festgesellschaft, Todesgesellschaft, Geheimgesellschaft". Dann wachte ich richtig auf.

Dann stand ich neben ihr, hatte jetzt Bettina nicht mehr auf dem Arm, sondern war selber nackt und hatte nur ein kleines Höschen an, das mein Glied nur mangelhaft bedeckte. Ich blickte neben der Tänzerin stehend, die sich sonst nicht weiter als so entkleidete, mit den Augen sie auffordernd auf ihre Hose, und dann auf die meine. Da zog sie ihre Hose herunter und dann die meine, und wir lagen uns nun nackt - doch stehend - in den Armen, wobei mein Glied auf ihrer Scham lag. Es war ein himmlisches Gefühl und wir gingen ganz darin auf, wiegend und schwebend. - In dem Moment, wo ich mein Glied in ihre Scham stecken wollte, erwachte ich in sehr heiterer Stimmung.

Es war klar, dass er ihr etwas tun wollte. Wir rannten hinter ihm her. Emme riss Billchen aus dem Bett und nahm ihn (so in der Handschrift satt "sie") schützend auf den Arm, während ich noch vor der "Käfig"-Tür den Bären beruhigen und zur Umkehr bewegen konnte.

Ab und zu sah ich Schilder mit Französischer Aufschrift. Ich war also schon im Elsass. Die Bahn fuhr hier sehr schnell. Offenbar durchquerte sie das fremde Territorium, ohne zu halten. Dann kam ich in einen Ort mit einer ganz alten romanischen Kirche, die ich schon von unserer Seite des Sees aus gesehen hatte. Hier steig ich aus. Die Kirche war wohl ein Kloster. Mit einem Zaun umgeben. Als ich noch sinnend davor stand, kam ein Mann aus einem Haus und führte mich hinein. Er sagte: Die alten romanischen Fenster können Sie von innen nicht sehen. Die sind von innen zugemacht. Im Innenraum standen alte Möbel (wie im Brockenhaus) und beim Altar war ein Licht. Jemand zelebrierte dort eine Messe, wie ich dachte. Mein Führer war aber merkwürdig laut. Dann sah ich, dass dort, wo der Altar sein musste, nur photographiert wurde. Die Kirche war säkuklarisiert. - Danach ein Stück des Traums unklar. Ich ging nun durch Kellergewölbe, die zur alten Universität gehörten. Vorher war ich aber noch bei Bewohnern jenes Dorfes gewesen, die mir ein Plüschtier für Frau J. gegeben hatten, weil sie so wild darauf sei. Im Keller war ein Teddybär, der Wewetzer gehörte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2133 (1959-03-13 - Freiburg)Traum von der Grauen Dame. Sie kam unerwartet zu Besuch. Wir schlenderten durch die Stadt und gingen schliesslich ins Kino. Hier sassen wir ganz dicht nebeneinander und schmiegten uns aneinander, und ihre Hand spielte mit meinem Glied und meine mit ihrem Körper. Im Film sah man erst Kriminalszenen. Die Detektive wollten etwas erforschen, was mit unseren Hausbesitzern zusammen hing. Dann gingen sie in eine Gastwirtschaft. Hier sah man nicht die Bühne sondern das Publikum. Sehr schöne Frauen, die das Geschehen auf der Bühne imitierten. Schliesslich trat auf der Bühne, die im Film nicht zu sehen war, eine Nackttänzerin auf. Sofort warf auch die Frau ihre Kleider ab und tanzte nackt leicht und schlank wie eine Feder. Man sah deutlich ihre Schamhaare. Während dieser ganzen Filmszene sassen wir dicht nebeneinander geschmiegt und spielten miteinander. - Dann sah man auch einen Mann mit der nackten Frau tanzen. Zuerst mit ledernen Kleidern, dann ohne Kleider, und zuletzt zwei nackte Frauen. Schliesslich hörte man eine Stimme von der Bühne - es war die wirkliche Nackttänzerin, die sagte, dass jene Frau aus dem Publikum viel schöner getanzt hätte als sie. - Dann kamen andere Szene in diesem Film. Ein Auto stürzte von einer Brücke, schwamm aber im Wasser weiter und an Land. Es waren dies komische Filmszenen. Eine ähnliche Szene wiederholte sich noch. Diesmal war auch eine badende Frau im Wasser. Dann Szenenwechsel. Ich war - jetzt allein - auf den Nachhauseweg. An einer Strassenecke fiel mir ein, dass ich Emme Schokolade mitbringen wollte. Ich wollte umkehren, kam, dabei aber mit meinem Mantel in einen Dornbusch, der mich eisern festhielt und nicht mehr losliess. Ich dachte im Traum: Bedeutet das nun Emme, die mich festhält, oder die Graue Dame, die mich festhält. Dann versuchte ich noch einmal loszukommen und erwachte in dem Moment, in dem der Dornstrauch mich freigab. (304 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2134 (1959-03-15 - Freiburg)Zuerst Spaziergang am See mit einem männlichen Begleiter in einer mir vertrauten Landschaft. Dann andere Szene. Ich lebe als Einsiedler oder Verschlagener zusammen mit einem Zweiten, ich glaube, es ist mein Vater, irgendwo in der Einsamkeit. Die Topographie dieser Szene ist aber aus der vorigen hervorgegangen. Wir haben uns einen Unterschlupf gebaut, eine Art kleine Hütte, die die Gestakt eines Tiers hat. Ich glaube, sie war aus dem Fell eines Tiers. Unsere Mittel sind ähnlich improvisiert wie bei Robinson. Als wir einmal fortgehen wollen - es ist im Winter - und mein Vater ist schon ein Stück weit von der Tierhütte fort, bemerke ich, dass sie durch die Hitze eines Ofens, den wir drinnen aufgestellt haben, in Brand zu geraten droht. Ich raffe mit den Händen Schnee zusammen, um es zu löschen, und versuche gleichzeitig, meinen Begleiter zurück zu rufen. Das Löschen gelingt mir. Doch da erfasst eine Art Wirbelwind das Tier - das grosse Ohren wie ein Esel hat - und hebt es mit allem unserem improvisierten Hab und Gut, unserer ganzen Robinsonwelt, in die Höhe. Wir eilen entsetzt herzu, doch können wir es nicht mehr halten, es fliegt in der Luft davon. In der nächsten Szene ist dies alles - was ich vorher getan habe - ein Spiel, das Billchen mir einem Spielgefährten ausgeführt hatte. Meine Rolle ist also jetzt Billchen. Ich rate ihr, ein neues Tier zu bauen - ein Fell hat sie - und die Utensilien dafür zusammen zu suchen. Sie hatte sie aus einer Mülltonne. Sie beginnt auch damit, doch verliert sie die Lust. Das Spiel lässt sich nicht wiederholen. Es hat seinen Reiz verloren. (270 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2135 (1959-03-19 - Freiburg)Wir wohnten in einer Wohnung zu ebener Erde, wo man aus dem Fenster unmittelbar auf die Strasse und von der Strasse unmittelbar ins Fenster sah. Plötzlich sahen wir draussen - auf der gegenüberliegenden Strassenseite - etwas ganz Merkwürdiges vorbeigehen: Ein Mann, der ganz und gar mit Fell bedeckt war, im Gesicht und am ganzen Körper, wie eine grosse Katze, oder wie la bête in Cocteaus "La belle et la bête". Überall wuchsen Haare. Er war in Begleitung einer schwangeren Frau, an der eigentlich nur eine etwas grosse Nase auffiel, aber die normal behaart war. Ich zeigte die beiden, meiner Familie. Dann kamen sie herüber, und der Fellmann schaute ganz zufällig in unser Fenster, wo ihn ein Bild an der Wand, dicht beim Fenster interessierte. Es entspann sich ein Gespräch, im Verlauf dessen sich zeigte, dass der Mann besonders für psychologische Tests interessiert war. Er fragte mich, ob ich den Farbtest kenne und den Spiraltest, und dann sprach er noch von einem anderen Test, der, glaube ich, der Genotest hiess. Im Laufe des Gesprächs kamen die beiden herein und setzten sich zu uns an den Tisch. Wir betrachteten Illustrierte, die dort lagen, und es stellte sich heraus, dass einer von beiden - ich glaube, es war die Frau - Bilder von grosser Männlichkeit bevorzugte. Wir stellten fest, dass in dieser Illustrierten alle Bilder, auch die von Frauen, einen solchen Ausdruck hatten. Die Frauen sassen etwa wie Amazonen auf Pferden, oder hatten goldene Helme auf, wie Walküren, oder ähnlich. Der Fellmann erzählte, dass die Illustrierten bewusst auf solche Werbungen abgestellt würden. Ich wunderte mich, wo die Redakteure so schnell eine so grosse Zahl geeigneter Bilder her bekämen. Er sagte, dass diese ad hoc und mit grosser Geschwindigkeit gemacht würden. Das ganze Gespräch war sehr locker und natürlich. Der Mann mit dem Fell zeigte einerseits eine besondere Natürlichkeit und unbefangene Männlichkeit, andererseits war er sehr gebildet und intelligent, keinesfalls aber das rohe Naturereignis, das ich im allerersten Moment hinter seinem Anblick vermutet hatte. Ich überlegte mir, dass seine fellartige Behaarung wahrscheinlich aus hormonalen Gründen entstanden sei und vielleicht auch durch irgend eine hormonale Behandlung beseitigt werden könnte, kam dann aber zu dem Schluss, dass seine Frau, die von ihm schwanger war, ihn vielleicht so mit dem Fell in seiner tierhaften Männlichkeit viel mehr lieben würde, und dass es auch fraglich sei, ob es gut ist, ihn, der so aufgewachsen und an ein solches Dasein in der Welt gewöhnt ist, plötzlich zu machen wie alle Anderen. Bei dieser Überlegung wachte ich auf. (418 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2140 (1959-04-06 - Freiburg)Traum von einer Rektoratswahl. Ich war dazu eingeladen - d.h. als Zuschauer. Offenbar sollte die Zeremonie oben in Benders Institut stattfinden. Ich hatte einen ganze Haufen Einladungen in der Tasche und nahm Emme mit. Wir gingen durch die Stadt. Es war schon spät. In der Kaiserstrasse sahen wir komische Aufzüge. Studentengruppen, zum Teil ausländische in merkwürdigen Uniformen wie Kürassiere oder andere alte Truppen mit wehenden Federbüschen und anderen Verzierungen. Auf einem Wagen hielt ein Mann, der offenbar zum Rektor gewählt worden war, eine Rede, die mehr einer Bierrede glich. Er erklärte, dass er ja der sehr viel ältere sei und darum die anderen in dieser Rede nur "Liebe Kollegen" nennen wolle. Im übrigen sagte er nichts von Bedeutung und trat etwas bärbeissig auf. Wir waren etwas unschlüssig, ob dies nun wohl der neue Rektor sei. Der Zug verlief sich, und wir begegneten einer asiatischen Studentengruppe, die sehr kriegerisch mit Messern ausgerüstet war mit grünen Uniformen und grüne Kappen tief im Gesicht trug. Ihr Anführer hatte eine Reihe von Armbanduhren in der Hand, die er uns zeigte, und sagte, er wisse auch nicht, wo die her seien. Sie waren offenbar aus Versehen erbeutet. Emme fragte ihn: War dieser "Pappa" da der neue Rektor?" - Er sagte: "Ja, sie konnten sich aber noch nicht einigen". Ich wunderte mich, denn er hatte auch keine richtige Rektoratsrede gehalten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2142 (1959-05-05 - Freiburg)Ich bekam einen sehr herzlichen Brief von Heiss, in dem er auf parapsychologische Fragen einging. Er stellte eine Häufung von Geburten berühmter Männer auf bestimmte Daten dar, die er als merkwürdige Coincidenz betrachtete. Hf, der gerade bei mir war, las den Brief zuerst. Dann wollte ich ihn lesen, aber ich wachte auf, ehe ich ihn zu Ende gelesen hatte. (59 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2146 (1959-05-24 - Freiburg)Mir begegnete eine Frau, die einen Ehering hatte, der ganz ähnlich wie der meine mit aufgelöteten Buchstaben gemacht war, nur breiter und mit mehr Buchstaben in verschiedenen Reihen. Bei näherem Zusehen entdeckte ich, dass auch der Spruch unserer Eheringe "Tutto a te mi guida" darunter war. In anderen Buchstaben-Reihen waren diese Buchstaben zu anderen Folgen kombiniert, andere enthielten andere Worte und Sprüche, die irgendwie, vielleicht durch Buchstaben-Vertauschungen, verschlüsselt waren. Teils waren die Buchstaben sehr schön gebildet, besonders das Q, das, wie manchmal in alten Texten, anders, schwungvoller als die anderen Buchstaben gebildet war und zwischen diesen eine Art geschwungene Verbindungslinie bildete. - Ich fragte sie, wer den Ring gemacht habe, und sie sagte, ihr Bruder. Ich zeigte ihr die Gleichheit des Spruches auf meinem Ring mit einem Teil des ihren (130 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2147 (1959-05-24 - Freiburg)Ein sehr schönes Mädchen, das im Bett lag. Ihr eigentlicher Mann war nicht da. Ich wollte mich zu ihr legen. Doch kam inzwischen Herr H., der das selbe wollte und sich gerade in dem Moment dazwischen drängte, als ich mich hinlegen wollte. Er sagte, er habe nur von 2 - 4 Mittagspause, und ich solle ihm den Vortritt lassen. Ich hatte dazu keine Lust und überlegte, wie man diesen Kampf austragen sollte. Dabei wachte ich auf. (76 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2148 (1959-05-25 - Freiburg)Traum vom psychologischen Seminar bei Hiltmann. Wir mussten dafür französisch übersetzen. Sie konnte den Text selbst nicht richtig übersetzen. Ich sagte ihr die vermutliche Übersetzung für einige Wörter. Doch war ich mir auch nicht sicher. Dann ein Seminar bei Heiss über formale Grundlagenprobleme der Psychologie: Es waren nur drei oder vier Leute da. Ich fand das bezeichnend für das ganze Interesse der Leute für solche Fragen. Heiss war sichtlich erfreut, mich unter den wenigen zu sehen, und wandte sich mir freundlich zu. Mit den Seminar verbunden war irgendwie das Ansehen eines Films. - Dann ein forstwissenschaftliches Seminar. Hier waren nur Studenten mit sehr groben, braungebrannten Gesichtern. Harmlos aber nett. (109 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2149 (1959-05-27 - Freiburg)Traum, der irgendwie etwas mit Herrn Vonessen zu tun hatte und mit Wohnverhältnissen. Wir hatten irgendwie gemeinsam eine Kirche als Lebens- und Aufenthaltsraum. Wir fühlten uns da ganz zu Hause. Es war aber nicht mehr eine Kirche, die richtig als Kirche diente. Vielleicht war sie irgendwie säkularisiert. Aber solche Überlegungen waren im Traum selbst nicht ausdrücklich. Andererseits - oder in anderen Szenen (?) - war es auch wieder unsere Wohnung, in der wir mit Herrn Vonessen zusammen waren. Das Mädchen (von dem Emme gestern nach der Tanzstunde erzählte), das aussah wie Puschi, war auch dabei. Die Küche und die Wohnung hatten gemeinsam, dass die Wände weiss getüncht waren. (Der Traum war gegen morgen geträumt, als die Sonne schon an die weissen Wände der Wohnung schien, war also wahrscheinlich ein optischer Reiztraum) (131 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2150 (1959-05-29 - Freiburg)Ich war in der Universität bei einer Art Rektorats- oder Eröffnungsrede. Der, der sie hielt, war Botaniker oder etwas Ähnliches. Darum wurden vor seiner Rede Blumen verteilt, die die Zuhörer in kleine Vasen ordnen sollten. Die Graue Dame sass neben mir. Wir hatten beide Nelken, die in die Vasen passten. Ausserdem hatte ich noch eine Reihe sehr schöner Schwertlilien, die grösser waren als die Vase. Da ich früher weggehen musste, sagte ich das, als ich die Blumen erhielt. Es hatte aber auf das Blumenordnen keinen Einfluss. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2151 (1959-06-07 - Freiburg)Die Graue Dame bekam ein Kind. Ich erinnerte mich an die ersten Stunden in diesem Semester, in denen wir sehr glücklich und in einem Gefühl tiefer Übereinstimmung zusammen waren. Wir hatten irgend etwas sehr einfaches und elementares zusammen getan. Ich glaube, es war ein Freibad. - Ich ging durch die Stadt, um sie zu besuchen. Dann fiel, mir ein, dass sie ja draussen in Hugstetten im Gartenhaus wohnt. Ich dachte darüber nach, wann wir uns wohl wiedersehen. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2152 (1959-06-08 - Freiburg)Traum:Ich ging zu Emme, die irgendwo anders war - ich glaube, sie war mit der Grauen Dame zusammen. Vorher noch andere Szene von der Betrachtung der Bilder einer manieristischen Malerei: Es waren Wolkenkratzer, die wie anschiessende Kristalle im Gestein wuchsen, also nicht alle lotrecht, sondern zum Teil auch schräg und wie aus einem gemeinsamen Mittelpunkt oder aus einer Kreis-ober- oder -Innenfläche hervorkommend. Das ganze Gemälde war zugleich auch eine Pflanze, deren Wurzeln sich bei der Betrachtung aus der Erde lösten. Die Wolkenkratzer waren wie Früchte oder Triebe an der Pflanze. Eine Kellnerin - es war in einem Lokal - versprach, die Pflanze mit den Wurzeln wieder einzupflanzen. (107 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2153 (1959-06-10 - Freiburg)Ich hatte etwas mit ihrem Freund zu tun, der vorübergehend hier war, und sah die Graue Dame nur ganz kurz. Sie sagte, als er einen Moment herausgegangen war, wir könnten nicht gemeinsam zusammen sein. Er dürfe nichts davon merken. Wenn er wieder weg sei, müssten wir uns richtig treffen. Sie beschwerte sich über seine engherzigen Ansichten über manches, so über die Rekruten. (62 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2156 (1959-06-23 - Freiburg)Traum von einer Höhle, in der viele versteinerte Fische waren. Die etwa fingergrossen Fische steckten meist nur mit dem Kopf im Stein, die versteinerten Leib und Schwanz schauten senkrecht nach oben heraus, so dass also alle Fische Kopf standen. Das ganze Gestein war voll davon. Man konnte sie leicht herauslösen. Irgend jemand hatte sie mit Wasser übergossen. Da plötzlich wurde ein Teil der doch uralt versteinerten Fische lebendig. Sie lagen schlängelnd und zuckend als lebendige - nun nicht mehr steinerne Fische auf der Erde. Es war ein schrecklicher und irgendwie unangenehmer Anblick. Ich dachte, man müsse die Fische nun ins Wasser tun, scheute mich aber, sie anzufassen, und erwachte. (109 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2157 (1959-06-23 - Freiburg)Vorher anderer Traum von Margund. Ich war in einem Arbeitsdienstlager, in dem aber Männer und Frauen gemischt waren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2158 (1959-06-26 - Freiburg)Ich bin in einem Haus mit einem grossen grünen Rasenplatz davor. In der Luft sind Flugzeuge. Eines, ein altmodisches Propellerflugzeug mit zwei Tragflächen, macht den Eindruck mühsamen Fliegens. Es zieht sehr langsam empor wie jemand, der mühsam klettert. Man sieht die Insassen. Kleine andere Flugzeuge. Plötzlich stürzt ein Flugzeugmotor mit dem Propeller senkrecht wie ein fallender Stein auf den Rasen vor dem Haus herab. Das restliche Flugzeug, das nun einen Tarnanstrich hat und grösser und moderner ist als das zuvor gesehene, kommt im Gleitflug heran. Wird es heil landen können, oder wird es eine Katastrophe geben? Man sollte das Unfallkommando rufen. Erwachen. (102 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2159 (1959-07-29 - Freiburg)Ich war oben auf einem alten runden Turm, dessen Boden (im obersten Stockwerk) mit Sand aufgeschüttet war. Dieser Sand enthielt eine Menge Steine mit versteinerten Muscheln (wie die in Nagold). Ich kniete im Sand und durchwühlte ihn mit meinen Händen, wobei ich mit dem Tastgefühl die Muscheln in den Steinen spürte und die Steine herauszog. Ich legte sie auf eins der breiten Fenstersimse, die aus roh zusammengefügten Steinen waren (wie bei dem alten romanischen Turm der Nagolder Friedhofskirche aus der Karolingerzeit, der selbst Muschelkalksteine enthält (Einfall). Es war herrlich, so in dem noch ganz frischen Sand zu wühlen. Ich war barfuss und hatte die Ärmel hochgekrempelt. Ein Stein war kugelrund und mit Muscheln bedeckt. Einzelne Muscheln hatten sich auch aus dem umgebenden Gestein ganz gelöst und waren da als vollplastische Form. Eine von ihnen war mit einer dünne Schicht von silbergrauem Perlmutt bedeckt. Ich überlegte mir, ob ich ihn der Grauen Dame schenken sollte. Später kam Emme. Wir wohnten in der Nähe in einem Art Ferienhaus. (166 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2160 (1959-08-04 - Freiburg)Besuch von Ika. Es war wieder ganz wie früher. Wir sprachen über Tongefässe und über Träume. Sie erzählte einen Traum von einer Freundin, ich glaube, es war Maria Philippi, der von einem wunderbar in sich geschlossenen länglich-ovalen fliegenden Körper handelte. Es musste nach der Beschreibung etwa aussehen wie meine blank polierten hölzernen Fische. Ika meinte, ich solle den Traum aufschreiben. Ich erwiderte, es wäre besser, wenn sie ihn selber aufschriebe, denn sie kenne die Beschreibung doch aus erster Hand; es schiene mir überhaupt schwierig, fremde Träume aufzuschreiben, denn für sie habe man doch nicht die unmittelbare Anschauung, die man für die eigenen Träume habe. Darum müsse jeder seine Träume selbst aufschreiben. - Das war nur ein Bruchstück aus dem langen Gespräch, das wie früher vieles berührte. (126 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2161 (1959-08-04 - Freiburg)Später nach Erwachen und erneutem Einschlafen wieder Traum von Ika. Es war jetzt Abend geworden und Ika sagte, sie wolle in der Nacht bei mir in meinem Bett schlafen. Emme war aber auch da, und es war in unserer Wohnung. Dann lag ich mit Ika zusammen auf einem Bett. Ich betastete die Formen ihres nackten Körpers, besonders die Oberschenkel und die Busen wie vorher die Tongefässe. Emme konnte jeden Moment herein kommen, und ich überlegte, was ich dann tun sollte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2164 (1959-08-10 - Freiburg)Ich fuhr mit dem Fahrrad einen sehr steilen Berg herunter. Die Geschwindigkeit wurde immer grösser, und ich merkte, dass ich bremsen musste, wenn ich unten am Ende der Strasse um die Ecke kommen wollte. Es war ein fremdes Rad. Ich trat zuerst langsam die Fussbremse, zog dann die eine Handbremse, die zum Hinterrad führte, und schliesslich stossweise die andere, die das Vorderrad bremste - gerade so viel, wie es ging, ohne dass ich mich überschlagen hätte. Aber die Geschwindigkeit verringerte sich nur wenig, keinesfalls soviel, dass ich hätte ganz anhalten können. Das Gefälle aber wurde immer steiler, so dass ich trotz des Bremsens nicht langsamer wurde. Irgendwo stand ein Schild, dass man hier absteigen solle, doch war mir das nicht möglich. Ich sauste das letzte steilste Stück herunter und kam an das Ende, wo die Strasse in eine grosse und offensichtlich verkehrsreiche Querstrasse einmündete. Ich kannte die Stadt nicht und wusste sowieso nicht, wo ich hinfahren sollte. Auf jeden Fall schien es mir am ratsamsten, nach rechts einzubiegen, weil ich dabei nicht in den Gegenverkehr kommen würde. Ich tat dies, konnte aber nicht direkt herumkommen, sondern kam auf die gegenüberliegende Seite der Strasse, wo ich schliesslich am Gehweg landete. Hier war eine Art Szenenwechsel. Eine wunderschöne Frau war da in durchsichtigen Strumpfhosen, die die Farbe ihrer Haut hatten, und einem durchsichtigen Hemd. Ich selbst hatte eine Art Strumpfhosen für Männer an, die leicht blau-türkis gestreift waren und eigentlich sehr amüsant aussahen. Es war eine Neuheit der Mode. Das Mädchen fand, dass sie mir gut ständen, und Emme, die jetzt auch dabei war, fand das auch. Wir gingen mit der Frau in ihre Wohnung. Sie war verheiratet und wohnte in Giselas ehemaliger Wohnung im Harburger Schloss. Ich war tief beeindruckt von dem Wiedersehen mit der Wohnung und sagte, dass ich sie schon kennte. Dort, wo auch Giselas Flügel gestanden hatte, stand ein Flügel, der der Frau gehörte und den sie, glaube ich, Silberflügel nannte. Sie spielte darauf. Er gab wunderbar silberne Töne. Es waren noch andere Mädchen und Frauen da, die sich alle in einer ähnlich freien Atmosphäre bewegten. Zwei stellten sich so neben mich, dass sie meinen Körper zwischen den ihren einschlossen, und legten ihre hübschen Gesichter an das meine. Es war eine sehr entspannte Atmosphäre, die irgendwie durchzogen war von der Traurigkeit der Erinnerung an Giselas Wohnung. Ich wachte dann ganz langsam auf und stellte mir im Aufwachen vor, wie ich jetzt zu Gisela gehen wollte, die ja noch im selben Haus wohnte, und sie dazu holen. Ich freute mich auf die Begegnung zwischen Gisela und Emme. Die weiche warme Atmosphäre dieses Traums ging ganz langsam in's Wachen über und war sehr anhaltend. (444 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2167 (1959-08-11 - Freiburg)Zuletzt ein Traum von einem Rennen, wo gross Autos, Lastautos oder Autobusse, kleine anhängerartige Wagen von der Grüsse eines Kinderwagens vor sich her schieben mussten. Sie kamen nur langsam vorwärts, wenn sie den Wagen nicht verlieren wollten. Es war eine Stadt mit vielen Treppen. Die Leute in den Autos sprachen englisch. Ich sass auf einem Lastwagen, von dem das Ganze gefilmt wurde. Später ging ich mit Bille eine lange Treppe hoch. Oben war ein kleines Mädchen, mit dem Bille Eis essen wollte. Das Mädchen wollte aber nicht. (87 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2168 (1959-08-11 - Freiburg)Wir hatten Besuch von einem Indonesier, der hier studierte. Das Gespräch kam auf eine Japaner, der beim Studium in irgendeiner Sache aus sprachlichen Gründen Schwierigkeiten hatte. Ich sagte, dass ich mir diese Schwierigkeiten gross vorstellte, und fragte den Indonesier, wie es eigentlich für ihn sei, ob für einen Indonesier diese Schwierigkeiten geringer seien als etwa für einen Japaner. Ich hatte ja seine Sprache noch nicht gehört. Er antwortete: "Das will ich aber gebeten haben" und war fast beleidigt, dass man ihn mit einem Japaner verglich, und redete einige Sätze auf indonesisch, die so klangen, dass viel davon ans Englische erinnerte. Ich wachte auf mit dem peinlichen Gefühl, etwas falsch gemacht zu haben, und zugleich, je mehr mir klar wurde, dass ich nur geträumt hatte, nun immer noch nicht zu wissen, wie es wirklich ist.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2169 (1959-08-20 - Freiburg)Besuch von Tante Lu, Gisela und Marlies. Ich war sehr beeindruckt, besonders von dem Wiedersehen mit Marlies. Sie war irgendwie namenlos da mit ihren langen blonden Haaren. (27 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2170 (1959-08-21 - Freiburg)Auf der Fahrt von oder nach Heidelberg Wir fuhren in einer Pferdekutsche über Strassen, die zum Teil frisch geteert waren, so dass man die linke Fahrbahn benutzen musste, weil die rechte frisch mit Teer überzogen war. Ich hatte etwas Sorgen, ob es gut gehen würde, wegen des von vorne und hinten kommenden Verkehrs. Aber es ging gut. Dann kamen wir an einen Ortseingang mit der Aufschrift: "Nagold, Kreis Heidelberg". Dies war eine Überraschung für Emme. Wir waren unerwartet nach Nagold gekommen. In einem anderen Traum nachher kamen wir zu Tante Lu zu Besuch. Sie sass am Kamin und fiel in Ohnmacht. Ich hatte Sorgen, es könne ein Schlaganfall sein. (109 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2171 (1959-08-28 - Freiburg)Ich bin mit vier braunen Insulanerinnen zusammen, die mich umschwärmen. Die eine von ihnen zieht sich zum Baden nackt aus. - Andere Traumszene: Ein Hubschrauber fliegt sehr niedrig fast zwischen den Häusern umher. Plötzlich setzt der Motor aus. Er gerät in eine Strassenschlucht zwischen die Häuser. Man sieht die ganze Familie, Mann, Frau und einen Jungen, in der Glaskanzel sitzen. Es gelingt ihm, noch einmal zu wenden. Jetzt kommt er schnurgerade auf unser Haus zu. Jeden Moment muss er die schräge Dachwand durchbrechen und ins Zimmer kommen. Ich fliehe aus dem Zimmer (es ist noch in der alten Wohnung) auf den Flur und erwache. (104 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2172 (1959-08-29 - Freiburg)Ein Mädchen, das in einer kirchlichen Prozession mitgehen wird. Sie trägt die grosse schwarze Fahne, mit der sie tändelnd und mit strahlendem Lächeln hinausgeht. Ich ergreife schnell die zweite schwarze Fahne und laufe hinter ihr her zum Sammelplatz der Prozession in der Stadt. Die Fahne ist garnicht leicht- Man hält sie vor sich her, den Schaft vor den Leib, so dass das schleierartige schwarze Tuch vor einem herabweht. So stehen wir jetzt nebeneinander. Das schwarze Tuch der beiden Fahnen streicht über unsere Köpfe im Wind und wir flirten miteinander. Ich weis noch nicht, ob ich bei der Prozession vor ihr oder neben ihr gehen muss. Auf jeden Fall scheint es mir merkwürdig, dass ich als Protestant eine katholische Prozession anführen werde. (121 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2173 (1959-09-06 - Freiburg)In einem Kellergang, in dem grosse Mengen weissen Asphalts fliessen, die ich mit dem nackten Fuss verteile und durchrühre, indem ich darin herumwate. Durch eine Tür am Ende des Ganges, eine bretterartige Kellertür, fliesst ein kleiner Teil des Asphalts fort. Es besteht die Gefahr, dass er in den Wald gerät und dabei die Bäume schädigt - denn in dem Traum ist hinter jener Tür zugleich der Wald, und der Kellergang ist zugleich auch wie ein Waldweg. Im Fortgang des Traums ist jedoch seine Gestalt als Kellergang eindeutig. Ich wate wieder durch die weisse dickflüssige Asphaltmasse. Durch eine seitliche Tür, die irgendwie nach draussen führt, und offensteht, können Passanten auf der Strasse - junge Männer - meinen Schatten sehen, den sie für den einer Frau halten, von der sie schwärmen. Ich schleiche mich vorsichtig an die Tür, ohne gesehen zu werden. Ich habe nur ein Hemd an, oder bin nackt und strecke den Arm so weit aus, dass ich die Tür schliessen und verschliessen kann. Ich drehe eilig den Schlüssel herum und wate dann schnell durch den Asphalt den Gang entlang, den ein nächtlich weisses Licht erfüllt, zur anderen Tür, weil ich damit rechnen muss, dass die Männer draussen, die meinen Schatten für dem einer Frau halten, jetzt erst recht wild nach ihr geworden sind und durch die andere Tür eindringen werden. Ich schliesse auch diese Tür. Doch schliesst sie nicht ganz dicht. Der Riegel des Schlosses überbrückt vielmehr einen Spalt, durch den man auch weiterhin hinein kucken können wird, obwohl die Tür verschlossen ist. - Inzwischen ist der Besitzer des Hauses, ein zwielichtiger Mann, herabgekommen, von dem ich aus einigen Bemerkungen plötzlich erkenne, dass er oben im Haus ein Baby verborgen hält, das in grosser Gefahr ist. Der Mann ist durch und durch böse. Ich werfe ihn auf den Steinboden des Kellerganges nieder, der hier grubenartig vertieft und mit Wasser erfüllt ist, so dass er mit dem Hinterkopf auf dem harten Steinboden aufschlägt. Er scheint zuerst tot zu sein, doch merke ich nach einigen Momenten, dass er sich noch rührt. Ich nehme mein massives braunes Teakholzbrett, das gerade dort liegt, und schmettere es auf seinen Kopf herab, der nun für meine Sicht durch das Brett verborgen ist. Ich bin ungewiss, ob er jetzt tot ist und vielleicht den Schädel gebrochen hat. Doch nach einer Weile beginnt er wieder sich zu rühren und ruft leise einen weiblichen Namen (wie Marie, Marianne oder ähnlich). Ich ergreife das sägeartig gezackte grosse Messer, das dort liegt, als Dolch und stelle mich am Rand der Steingrube auf für den Fall, dass er hoch kommt. Doch weil der Rand glitschig und glatt ist, streife ich meine Sandalen, die ich jetzt anhabe, von den Füssen und kralle mich mit den nackten Füssen auf dem leicht gewölbten Steinrand der Grube fest auf dem glitschigen Stein und stehe leicht balancierend mit gehobenem Messer da, jeden Moment eine Bewegung des Mannes erwartend. Ich bin entschlossen, ihn zu töten, da sonst mir der Tod droht. Die ganze Szene, besonders das Festkrallen mit den Füssen auf dem nackten Stein - wie schon vorher das Waten in dem weissen Asphalt - ist ungeheuer lustvoll und erregend. (523 words)

Dazu flogen sie über Kopf, so dicht über dem Wasser, dass die Hubschrauberflügel ins Wasser eintauchten, um sie zu bremsen. Dann drehten sie sich wieder um, wo sie nun, nachdem die Geschwindigkeit der Flügel gebremst war, ganz wenig Auslauf brauchten. Das Bild war sehr raffiniert und unheimlich, und ich wusste zuerst nicht, was das Flugzeug wollte, als es plötzlich so dicht über Kopf über dem Wasser flog. Das Becken war ganz ausbetoniert. Ich wohnte daneben in einem Haus, wo vorher mir noch unbekannte Raumverhältnisse eine Rolle spielten. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2180 (1959-09-27 - Freiburg)Weiterer Traum am Morgen: Ich war in der obersten Etage der Universität und schob wie einen Kinderwagen Fräulein Strauchs Auto vor mir her (das aber im Traum nicht ein Volkswagen, sondern ein grösseres, ein Ford-Taunus oder ein Opel war). Ich war mit dem Auto im Aufzug hochgekommen, hatte oben irgend etwas erledigt und wollte nun durch die im Kreis angelegten Flure andersherum zurückfahren. (Es war übrigens im Traum so, als ob es dort Aufzüge gäbe). Vor den Türen von Heiss' Institut, das sich genau an der Stelle befand, wo es früher vor Jahren war (inzwischen befindet es sich in einem ganz anderen Haus) - das aber im übrigen der heutigen Situation entsprach, sassen eine Menge von Leuten, die auf seine Sprechstunde warteten, darunter auch ältere Herren, die wie Professoren aussahen. Ich überlegt, ob sie bei Gelegenheit des Heidelberger Kongresses hier auf der Durchreise waren. Diese Leute auf den Bänken nun hatten den Gang auf dem Flur so eng gemacht, dass ich mit meinem Kinderwagen-Auto nicht durchkam. Ich musste sie darum bitten, aufzustehen und wachte auf. (175 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2184 (1959-10-08 - Freiburg)Ich ass zusammen mit Bettina meinen Steiff-Tier-Hahn (der aber im Traum nicht aus Stoff, sondern aus Schokolade war) auf.

Bettina war begeistert. Bille, glaube ich, weniger. (57 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2187 (1959-10-24 - Heidelberg)Das abstrakte Bild, das in Marions Zimmer hängt, war in diesem Traum als räumliches Gebilde im Raum. Es war ein grosser weiter Raum, in dem das auf dem Bild Dargestellte (das nicht gegenständlich bestimmt ist) als plastisch räumlich Seiendes in der Nähe der einen Wand war- aber nicht als Bild oder Plastik, sondern als etwas Seiendes, das als es selbst da war. Der Traum hatte sehr lange gedauert, ohne dass eigentlich etwas geschah. Es war nur immer dieses selbständige plastische Seiende da, das aber im Traum auch nicht als etwas Abstraktes oder Dargestelltes, sondern als seine eigentliche eigene Wirklichkeit da war. Der Traum hat mich sehr beschäftigt. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass er sich durch Stunden hindurch immer wiederholte. (119 words)

Ich erzählte ihm, wie hier unverputzter Beton als Innenkonstruktion in das alte Gemäuer gebaut sei, und wie schön das sei. Wir unterhielten uns über den Stil des alten Gebäudes. Ich sprach es als frühen Barock an. - Später eine andre Szene: Wir waren in Marion und Peters Wohnung und verabschiedeten uns. Marion hatte für uns einen Zettel hingelegt, auf dem sie uns 1/2 Pfund Gold schenkte, damit die Reise uns nichts kosten sollte. Das war umgerechnet ungefähr 100 Mark. Ich war ganz gerührt davon und nahm ihr Gesicht flüchtig in meine Hände. Sie lächelte und schaute ins Nachbarzimmer, ob es Peter nicht gesehen hatte. (117 words)

Er wurde selbst auf diese Felleistung aufmerksam und dachte dabei an Sich-Versprechen im Sinne von beim Reden etwas Anderes sagen, als man wollte. Mir aber war klar, dass der eigentliche Sinn der Fehlleistung im Sich-Verprechen als Geloben lag. Ich machte ihn auf die Doppeldeutigkeit seiner Fehlleistung aufmerksam. (69 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2192 (1959-11-11 - Freiburg)Ich zeigte meinem Bruder (zugleich oder vorher war es aber auch Emmes Bruder Eber) Heidelberg. Wir gingen am Neckar entlang. Dort kamen wir an ein merkwürdiges Kolonaden-artiges Bauwerk, das in den Neckar hinein reichte und aus der Nazizeit stammte. Es sollte ursprünglich als Freilichttheater dienen. Ich hatte es zum letzten mal gesehen, als ich vor 20 Jahren mit meiner Mutter dort war (also nicht bei meinem letzten Besuch bei Marion und mit Emme). Wir stiegen hinauf. Oben wurde mir schwindlig, und ich drohte hinab zu stürzen. Mein Bruder musste mich mit aller Gewalt zurückziehen. Wir setzten dann den Spaziergang fort in Richtung auf Marions Haus. - Andere Szene: Ich ging mit Marion spazieren. Sie war merkwürdig verändert, als ob sie Stimmen hörte. Ich merkte, dass sie schizophren war. (128 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2193 (1959-11-11 - Freiburg)Mit Emme unterwegs. Wir kommen in ein Gasthaus, in dem auch Yul Brynner (der bekannte Schauspieler mit dem asiatisch kahl rasierten Kopf) ist. Ich pfeife unwillkürlich vor mich hin die Melodie von Tom Dooley. Yul Brynner sagt resigniert: "Dann muss ich eben rausgehen", denn er kann den Schlager nicht mehr hören, weil er ihn immer gesungen hat. Ich sage, er solle nur bleiben, ich habe es unwillkürlich getan. Es entsteht ein Gespräch. Im Verlauf dessen schenkt er Emme ein Exemplar irgend einer Zeitschrift, in der etwas von ihm steht, mit seinem Autogramm. Sie gibt ihm einen Kuss. Die Szene sieht rührend kindlich aus. Ich muss lächeln und sehe weg, um das nicht zu zeigen. Dann gehen wir fort. Ich ziehe noch schnell unsere Betten zurecht (es ist einen Art Herberge), um es nicht zu unordentlich zurückzulassen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2195 (1959-11-24 - Freiburg)Aus dem Küchenfenster schaute man auf zwei grosse Gärten zwischen den Häusern. Ich sagte zu Emme, dass ich diese recht schön fände, aber sie meinte, die Gärten seien ungepflegt. Ich stellte mir vor, wir hätten die Gärten - was wir daraus machen würden. Dann entdeckte ich plötzlich an der einen Seite des hinteren Gartens ein haushohes Bücherbord mit riesigen Büchern. Es war so gross wie die Wand eines Hauses und hatte doch nicht mehr Borde als ein normales Bücherbord. Entsprechend gross waren die Bücher. Erst dachte ich, sie wären nur aufgemalt, aber dann erkannte ich, dass sie echt waren. Ich stand nun neben dem Bord, das zugleich in der Küche war. Trotz seiner Grösse, die sich gleichgeblieben war, konnte ich doch bequem bis ins oberste Bord langen und war darüber erstaunt. Zwischen den Büchern lag eine alte Illustrierte. Ich nahm sie herab und blätterte in ihr und freute mich, dass sie aus einer Zeit stammte, als die Illustrierten noch weniger prüde waren als jetzt. Ich hatte die Illustrierte damals schon einmal gesehen und erinnerte mich, sie mit Hf. zusammen angesehen zu haben. Sie stammte aus der Zeit, wo ich meine Traum-Arbeit angefangen hatte, vor etwa drei Jahren. Es waren schöne Mädchen darin abgebildet, die wenig an hatten, und ich beguckte sie mit Vergnügen. - Andere Szene: Ich lag mit Emme im Bett in der Küche, als es furchtbar an der Tür rattelte und Hermhaus rief. Ich wurde wach und stellte fest, dass das Fenster zugehängt war und die Tür abgeschlossen, aber Hermhaus rattelte immer heftiger an der Tür und rief etwas von einem Ofen. Emme aber hielt mich eisern im Bett fest, offenbar hatte sie Angst. Sie war nicht dazu zu bringen, ihre Arme zu lösen, die sie fest um mich geschlungen hatte, auch nicht, wenn ich sagte, dass Hermhaus an der Tür sei. (304 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2196 (1959-11-28 - Freiburg)Die neuen Glocken des Münsters wurden zum ersten mal geläutet. Ich schaute aus dem Nordzimmerfenster und sah in der - noch vom Aufhängen der Glocken her- offenen Glockenstube die grossen Glocken sich bewegen. Der Kran, mit dem sie aufgehängt wurden, hob noch eine grosse Glocke, wie es schien, in die Höhe, schwenkte sie dann aber in einer ganz grossen Bewegung auf uns zu, statt auf den Glockenturm - und nun erkannte ich, dass es sich nicht nur um eine Glocke handelte, sondern um etwas wie eine grosse metallene Kanne, dass er zwischen uns und dem Münster in die Tiefe stürzen liess. Dann wiederholte sich der selbe Vorgang noch einmal. Diesmal aber kam uns der Kran sehr nahe. Ein Begleiter, der neben mir stand, sagte noch etwas Warnendes. Wir sprangen vom Fenster zurück, und schon stürzte die riesige Kanne durchs Fenster und kleine glühende und funken-sprühende Teilchen sprangen aus ihr und breiteten sich wie hüpfend und zischend (der Bewegung nach) auf dem Fussboden aus, als ob sie strebten, uns einzuholen. Wir sprangen aus der Tür und versuchten, diese zu schliessen. Doch die kleinen Dinger waren schon hinter uns her und kamen ins zweite Zimmer. Erst die nächste Tür gelang es mir zu schliessen. Ich rannte zu Emme, um ihr die Gefahr zu schildern, doch diese schien noch nicht so beunruhigt zu sein und wollte trotz meiner Warnung die Tür wieder öffnen. Ich sah noch, ehe ich erwachte, wie sie die Tür geöffnet hatte, und konnte in dem Zimmer - im Augenblick wenigstens - nichts entdecken. (254 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2199 (1959-12-11 - Freiburg)Ich war aus einem Traum aufgewacht, und mir wurde ganz klar, dass ich vom Thema "Karneval - ich habe ein auffälliges Kostüm an" geträumt hatte. Sannwald, der im selben Raum war, hatte fast das Selbe geträumt. Ich war sehr verwundert darüber. Ich begann, den Traum aufzuschreiben, bei dem es sich darum handelte, dass man etwas Schweres den Berg hinauftragen musste. Da fiel mir aber ein, dass ich auch noch etwas anderes zu dem Thema geträumt hatte, nämlich von einem Hunde, den man in Kreis um sich herumschwenken musste. Das war ein auffälliges Kostüm. Das war im Traum ganz klar gewesen. Ich überlegte, wann dieser Traum gewesen war. Ich war aus dem anderen Traum (vom Berghinauftragen) direkt erwacht, also musste der vom Hunde vorher gewesen sein. Ich begann also zu schreiben: "Zuerst von einem Hunde, den man im Kreis um sich herum schwenken musste. Das war das auffällige Kostüm". Dann schrieb ich sorgfältig den zweiten Traum auf, der das Thema sehr deutlich erfüllte. Im selben Raum, in dem Sannwald und ich sassen, war auch noch Frau Mitscherlich (die Frau meines Forstchefs), aber hier war es die Frau des Traumprofessors, die letztes mal auch am Traumkolloquium teilgenommen hatte. Sie fragte, ob wir auch zum Thema geträumt hätten, und als wir sagten, dass wir einen Traum dazu gehabt hätten, zeigte sie ihr Erstaunen, dass es nur einer sei. Offenbar hatte sie viel mehr dazu geträumt und fand unsere Leistung zu gering. Ich liess mich durch diese Zwischenfrage nicht vom Schreiben abbringen, und als ich damit fertig war und sehr stolz, nun endlich einen Traumbefehl erfüllt zu haben, erwachte ich. (Ende des Traums). Mir wurde nun allmählich klar, dass ich von meinen Träumen überhaupt noch nichts aufgeschrieben, sondern das Aufschreiben nur geträumt hatte. Ich versuchte darum sofort, den Traum zu memorieren,Aber es gelang mir nicht mehr, zu erinnern, worin eigentlich das auffällige Kostüm bestanden hatte, in dem ich die Sache, es war eine Art Kiste, den Berg - es war der Brombergkopf - hinauftragen musste. Ob es auch ein Hund gewesen war, oder etwas anderes, oder ob ich vielleicht in dem Traum überhaupt kein auffälliges Kostüm angehabt hatte. Ebenso gelang es mir nicht mehr, mich zu besinnen, ob der Karneval in dem Traum irgendwie mitgegeben war, obwohl beim geträumten Traumaufschreiben ganz klar gewesen war, dass das Thema total erfüllt gewesen war. Schliesslich besann ich mich, dass ich vorher in der Nacht einen Traum gehabt hatte, in dem zwei Mädchen ihre Fahrräder den Brombergkopf hinauf schieben wollten. Im Traum vom auffälligen Kostüm hatte ich aber selbst etwas Schweres den Berg hinauf getragen. Ob ich diesen Traum überhaupt geträumt oder vielmehr ihn nur als erinnerten und aufzuschreibenden Traum geträumt habe, das kann ich auch bei schärfster Besinnung nicht mehr feststellen. Genau erinnere ich mich dagegen noch, den Traum von den beiden Mädchen wirklich geträumt zu haben. (470 words)

Irgendwo in dem Haus hörte man Stimmen von unten. Ein Mädchen, es hiess Vera oder ähnlich, und ihr Vater, die dort lebten. Im letzten Moment gelang es mir, nach dort unten hin einen geheimen Ausgang zu finden. Er führte vom Klo, wo ein Teil der Wand aus Pappe war, hinab. Der Vater, der mir zuerst begegnete, war der Typ eines Hotelmanns - gepflegt und so, als ob die ganze merkwürdige Umgebung um ihn nicht wäre. Das Mädchen war sehr liebevoll.

Das Pferd kommt auf mich zu, ist nicht auf seine Bahn zurück zu bringen und riecht an der Flasche und an meinen Händen. Ich werfe die leere Flasche weg, da ich merke, dass der Schnapsgeruch es ist, der es ablenkt. Aber meine Hände riechen noch nach Schnaps, und so ist es nicht von der Stelle zu bringen. Zugleich erfahre oder erinnere ich irgendwie, dass das Pferd früher zusammen mit tanzenden Hunden einen Dressurakt vollbringen musste, die immer Schnaps tranken. Diese Hunde waren ihm unangenehm. An sie wurde es durch den Schnapsgeruch erinnert und dadurch abgelenkt. (135 words)

Im Weitergehen merkte ich, dass die Stadt viel mittelalterlicher aussah, als ich sie in Erinnerung hatte. Überall waren alte Fachwerkhäuser. Doch waren diese neu angestrichen mit bunten Farben, zum Teil gestreift und sehr farbenprächtig, aber so, dass die alte Architektur darin neu zum Ausdruck kam. Schliesslich gelangte ich so durch alte Strassen bis an das Ufer eines Sees. Es war der Ziegelsee. Ich war ich von seiner Grösse und Weite überrascht, die mich sehr beeindruckte. Es war eine bezaubernde Landschaft. Ich beschloss, es Emme zu zeigen. (103 words)

Wir erwarteten aber meinen Vater, der einen Umschlag mit Geld holen wollte, ich glaube, eine Art Prüfungsgebühr, vielleicht hing es mit einer Habilitation zusammen, aber das erinnere ich nicht genau. Es klingelte. Ich sagte: "Das ist Vater", und stand schlaftrunken auf, ohne doch die Augen schon öffnen zu können. So tastete ich mich zur Tür und machte auf.. Emme war wohl in dem selben schlaftrunkenen Zustand hinter mir. Ich bewegte mich immer noch mit den geschlossenen Augen in Richtung auf meinen vermeintlichen Vater zu. Aber ich traf niemand, hörte nur ein Huschen. Emme musste irgendwie zur Seite gestossen worden sein. Ich begriff: Es waren Diebe. Sie wollten die 200 DM. in dem Kouvert, das in der Wohnung irgendwo angelehnt stand. Ich konnte immer noch nicht die Augen öffnen und versuchte, laut zu rufen: "Diebe".

Es war eine Räumlichkeit wie in der elterlichen Wohnung in Schwerin. Ich konnte die lauten Stimmen durch den Fussboden herauf hören. Mar. sagte: "Uslar trägt immer eine ganze Schachtel von Knöpfen bei sich" - um dadurch meine Pedanterie zu charakterisieren. Andere Dinge, die ich vergessen habe, gingen mehr ins Erotische. Später traf ich andere, die zusammen mit Mar. in der Wohnung gewesen waren und mir seine Äusserungen bestätigten. Schliesslich traf ich Mar. selbst, der aber alle solche Äusserungen abstritt. Dabei hatte ich alle deutlich gehört, aufgeschrieben - mit Bleistift auf Papier - und von Zeugen bestätigt bekommen. Aber Mar.s. Ableugnen war überzeugend. Jetzt wurde mir plötzlich klar, dass ich das alles nur geträumt hatte, und ich war ziemlich erleichtert. Auch Heiss begegnete mir sehr freundlich und zeigte keine Anzeichen, die ein solches Gespräch bei ihm hätte hinterlassen müssen. Ich hatte also nur einen Traum aufgeschrieben - und war nun ganz froh, dass auf diese weise also der Traum schon aufgeschrieben sei. Dann wachte ich allmählich ganz auf, und mir wurde klar, dass auch dieses letzte Gespräch mit Mar. nur Traum gewesen war und ich den Traum also in Wirklichkeit noch nicht aufgeschrieben hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2209 (1960-03-05 - Nagold)In unserer Wohnung, die aber anders war als in Wirklichkeit. Auf einer Couch im Wohnzimmer lagen merkwürdige Schädel von Dinosauriern. Sie waren riesengross, weisslich und unheimlich und an einigen Stellen blasig geworden, wie wenn die Form sich etwas aufgelöst und später wieder verfestigt hätte. Wir hatten diese Schädel schon lange - aber jetzt wurde mir plötzlich wieder klar, wie grausig sie sind. Unten vom Hof hörte man Kommandos von Bundeswehrsoldaten. Dann kam Emme zurück. Vorher hatte ich das Gefühl, Einbrecher könnten kommen. Emme hatte eine Lampe gekauft. Sie sei ganz billig gewesen. Es war eine grünliche Lampe, ein Holzkreuz mit vier in dreieckigen Formen gepressten Pappschirmen darauf. Ich sagte etwas dagegen. Sie sagte, sie hielte es ohne Lampe einfach nicht mehr aus (wir hatten immer noch die nackten Birnen an der Decke) und diese sei ganz billig gewesen. Mir war der Gedanke grausig. Ich ging rückwärts aus dem Zimmer und schrie laut "Nein". (Davon erwachte ich mit starkem Herzklopfen. Ich hatte wirklich laut Nein gerufen und hörte im Erwachen noch meine Stimme.) (172 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2210 (1960-03-06 - Nagold)Auf einer Strasse vor einer Tankstelle oder Raststätte. Wir (Emme und ich) sind mit einem Auto gekommen, das ein Lastauto oder Autobus ist. Es steht am Strassenrand geparkt. Ein paar Schritte davon ein grosses Benzinauto. Ich stehe auf den Bürgersteig. Emme ist ins Gebäude gegangen, da sehe ich von hinten ein Personenauto kommen, das offenbar auch parken will. Es fährt aber dabei immer dichter an unser grosses Auto heran und droht dieses zu rammen. Darum hebe ich die Hand und gebe dem Fahrer ein Haltzeichen. Der kümmert sich aber nicht darum, sondern fährt direkt an das grosse Auto heran und beginnt, dieses mit seinem Wagen zu schieben. Mir wird deutlich, dass er nach ganz kurzer Zeit mit dem geschobenen grossen Lastauto oder Autobus auch das Benzinauto erreichen wird, das er selber nicht sieht. Ich wiederhole darum ein Haltzeichen mit der erhobenen Hand. Aber er fährt unbeirrt weiter. Jetzt wird mir klar, dass er das grosse Auto stehlen will und das alles in verbrecherischer Absicht tut. Darum lässt er sich nicht mehr aufhalten. Er schiebt nun, ohne es zu merken, auch das Benzinauto. Doch dazu reicht die Kraft des Personenwagens nicht. Die ganz Kolonne der drei Autos kommt von der Strasse ab, Benzinauto und dahinter das Lastauto machen sich selbständig und rollen auf freiem Feld auf das Gebäude zu, auf das sie dabei auframmen müssen. Ich sehe das Benzin(Tank)auto dem Gebäude immer näher kommen und bin von Schrecken ergriffen, denn es wird beim Aufprall explodieren und vielleicht das Gebäude mit ihm, und in dem Gebäude ist Emme. Den eigentlichen Aufprall auf das Gebäude kann ich nicht sehen, denn ein Vorbau behindert den Blick an dieser Stelle, aber ich höre dumpfe Detonationen - aber es ist keine Stichflamme zu sehen. Ich erwache zugleich mit starker Angst und mit dem Gefühl, dass die Explosion des Gebäudes ausbleibt und Emme doch noch hinauskommt. (309 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2211 (1960-03-11 - Nagold)Merkwürdiger Traum, in dem Hf. zweimal vorkam. Er war bei uns zu Besuch und machte es sich ganz gemütlich. Es war aber schon ein Anderer zu Besuch, der immer bei uns war, und dieser liess ihm alle Freiheit im Sich-Entfalten, was er, ehe er sich auf den Heimweg machte, irgendwie zum Ausdruck brachte. Dieser Andere, war aber - wie mir im Erwachen richtig klar wurde, obwohl es vorher auch nicht unklar war - ebenfalls Hf. Beide Personen waren ganz selbstverständlich unsere Gäste, so selbstverständlich, dass ihr Name und ihre Identität gar nicht zur Frage wurden. Beide waren aber in Wirklichkeit Hf. Das damit verbundene Problem einer Verdoppelung der Person tauchte aber im Traum gar nicht auf. Der zweite Hf., der am Schluss den anderen lobte, hatte vielleicht ein wenig Ähnlichkeit mit Christian v. Ferber. (134 words)

Wir gingen eng aneinander geklammert durch die Stadt (Freiburg) und erst in meine Wohnung, wo wir aber Hf. trafen, dann in ihre, wo wir lange Treppen wie in einem Dämmerzustand, ganz fest ineinander verschlungen, hinaufstiegen. Oben tönte uns wieder Hf.s Stimme entgegen. - Früher in der Nacht anderer Traum von einem Mädchen, das entweder Bambi oder Gärdle war. Ich fuhr mit meiner Hand unter ihren Kleidern über die Haut ihres Körpers und geriet dabei fast wie im Spiel, eigentlich ohne es zu wollen, mit meinen tastenden Fingern in das Innere ihrer Scheide, die sie ganz fest zuschloss mit so kräftigen Muskeln, dass ich die Finger nicht mehr herausziehen konnte. Irgendwie bestand in dem Traum dabei noch eine Beziehung zu einem eifersüchtigen Mann - entweder Richard, Gärdles Mann, oder Hf., wegen Bambi. (158 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2214 (1960-03-25 - Nagold)Traum, in dem mir vieles nur noch undeutlich in Erinnerung ist. Zunächst: Mir war plötzlich eingefallen, dass am Abend - es war, glaube ich, am Mittwoch - ein Seminar von Max Müller sei, das ich auf keinen Fall verpassen durfte, nachdem ich jetzt von ihm die Stelle als Wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft bekommen hatte. Ich eilte zu dem Gebäude in der Stadt, wo das Seminar stattfand. Vor dem Tor fiel mir ein, oder erfuhr ich, dass das Seminar ausfiel. Ich traf jetzt irgendwo Hf., der wohl in einem Gebäude gegenüber war und nun erzählte, dass er - bei einer mehr öffentlichen Tätigkeit - viele Briefe mit Unterschriften von Max Müller gesehen habe, die wohl von einer politischen Tätigkeit herrührten. Ich kam dann irgendwie in das Gebäude gegenüber, das einen sehr exklusiven Charakter hatte (etwa wie ein Max Planck-Institut), und dessen Tore fest verschlossen gehalten wurden. Dort sah ich in einem Zimmer, in dem zwei Kollegen wohnten, bei denen ich wohl übernachten sollte, ein merkwürdiges Phänomen. Sie hatte eine kleine Schnur wie eine Zündschnur durch das Zimmer gespannt, die sie über den Betten mit einer Schere durchschnitten. Daraufhin schlossen sich fast lautlos automatisch die Fenster und die Gardinen rollten zu. Es war sehr imposant, und sie zeigten eine kindliche Freude über diesen technischen Mechanismus. Es war eine spielerisch angenehme Atmosphäre. Dann war ich in einer Treppenhalle, wohl des selben Gebäudes, wo ein Chor probte, der wunderbar sang. Ich stand mit dem Rücken zum Chor und schaute in das Treppenhaus, von wo der Gesang in wunderbarer Akustik zurückdrang. Später drangen eine grosse Zahl Männer und Mädchen die Treppe herauf, die wohl zu einem anderen Chor gehörten, von denen ich einige kannte. Eines der Mädchen hatte einen Rock an mit manschettenförmig abstehendem Bund, aus dem ein Stück des Oberkörpers nackt hervorragte, weil ihre Bluse nicht ganz bis zur Taille herabreichte. Man spürte die nackte Haut, die man sah, in den Fingerspitzen. Andere hatte weite Ausschnitte oder fast rückenfreie Kleider. Später wandten sie sich einem Chorleiter zu, auf den sie wohl gewartet hatten, und ich ging wieder an meinen alten Platz, um dem Gesang des anderen Chors zu lauschen, der eine wunderbare Ruhe, Schönheit und Geschlossenheit hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2221 (1960-05-27 - Freiburg)Frl. Strauch begegnete mit und sagte mir, dass Bender die Leitung eines neuen grossen parapsychologischen Instituts übernommen hatte, wofür er aber den Lehrstuhl an der Universität aufgeben musste. Das wunderte mich sehr. Auf meine Frage erfuhr ich aber, dass er jederzeit in das alte Verhältnis zurück konnte. Sein neues Reich musste sehr viel ausgedehnter sein. Irgendwelche Orden und Verdienste aus dem Krieg schienen mit eine Rolle zu spielen, dass er es bekam. Ausserdem schien einer seiner Gegner - wie die Aberglaubenleute - es ihm zugespielt zu haben. Bender hatte es aber so gewendet, dass es für ihn ein Vorteil war, und bei der Gelegenheit, glaube ich, auch einen Preis gewonnen. Auch Strauchs Tätigkeit änderte sich dadurch. Sie wohnte wohl recht vornehm in dem neuen grossen Haus, aber auch irgendwie zurückgezogen. Ich erinnerte sie daran, dass wir uns nun so lange aneinander gewöhnt. Das neue Haus lag in einer Strasse wie die Herzberger Landstrasse in Göttingen (etwa wie das der dortigen pädagogischen Akademie), war aber in Freiburg. Ich begleitete Frl. Strauch noch ein Stück auf einem Weg in die Stadt und fragte noch dieses und jenes über Bender und ihre neue Stellung. Unser Verhältnis zueinander war dabei sehr herzlich.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2222 (1960-05-27 - Freiburg)ich war mit Emme in ein schloss-artiges Gebäude gekommen, wo wir übernachteten. Wir kamen in ein Zimmer, das zwei Betten hatte, die aber in kleinen Nebenkammern standen, von denen die eine die weisse Höhle und die andere die schwarze Höhle hiess. Ich sollte in der weissen Höhle schlafen. Die Türen, die ich zuerst öffnete, führten aber in einen Baderaum, wo sich gerade ein anderer Gast des Hauses wusch, und in ein Klo. Dann fand ich schliesslich den weissen kleinen Raum, in dem mein Bett stand. Es war ein altes Haus mit dicken Mauern. Vorher andere Szenen. In einer kam ein Mann vor, dessen Vorfahren aufgezählt wurden. Es waren einfache Leute, die in dem Zusammenhang der Geschichte, in der er vorkam, nicht standesgemäss schienen. Aber eine von den Vorfahren, eine Grossmutter, war die Königin von England. - Dann eine Szene, wo wir Eier verkauften. Ich zerdrückte aus Versehen einige. - Schliesslich eine Szenen, in der wir irgendwo, es hing schon mit dem Schloss zusammen, Milch umsonst bekamen. Nur die Sahne mussten wir bezahlen. (172 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2223 (1960-05-28 - Freiburg)Ein Altstadthaus mit dicken Mauern und verschiedenen Eingängen, in das ich mich schon einmal hineingeschlichen habe. Drinnen ist ein Fest. Ich stehe mit Emme davor. Sie will rein, aber die Tür ist zu. Ich öffne die Tür zum Toreingang daneben. Von dort weiss ich eine Verbindungstür zum Hausflur, die ich aufriegeln kann, gehe hinein und riegele die Haustür von innen auf. Dann kommt Emme hinein - ich glaube mit den Kindern -, und wir gehen in das Fest. Wir haben Kostüme an. Ein Mädchen umringelt mich und streicht liebkosend über meine nackten Schultern. (93 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2224 (1960-05-29 - Freiburg)Ich war beim Militär. Der Chef kam mit einer Pressluftflasche herein, woraus ich schloss, dass er eine Graphologie-Klausur schreiben lassen wollte. Das war aber nicht der Fall, sondern er wollte nur das Zimmer besichtigen. Er betrachtete die Bilder an der Wand etc. und machte zu allen Bemerkungen. Bei mir sagte er: "Uslar hat den Kopf wieder voller Liebe". Ich antwortete: "Ist das nicht ganz natürlich?" (65 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2225 (1960-05-30 - Freiburg)Gehe über südliche Grenze in die Schweiz. Habe deutsche Zigaretten bei mir, die ich gedankenlos mitgenommen habe. Der Zöllner schmeisst sie einfach weg, weil er als selbstverständlich annimmt, dass ich sie nicht verzollen will. Ein Mann ist dabei, der von einem Zollbeamten sehr genau untersucht wird. Man findet bei ihm ein Gewehr. Man will umgehen, ihn zu bestrafen, will ihn zu seiner Mutter zurückschicken. Andere Szene: Gehe auf schmalen Pfaden durch ein Trümmergelände. Plötzlich sind die Pfade abgesperrt. Ein Mann bewacht die Absperrung. Ich habe unsere grosse Berliner-Porzellan-Vase im Arm. Sie fällt mir aus der Hand und rollt ganz weit in das Trümmerfeld herab. Unten sieht sie in der Form ähnlich aus wie ein Klobecken. Ich sehe unten Leute im Trümmerfeld und rufe. Einer bringt sie mir mit herauf. Sie ist heil geblieben und hat auch ihre klare runde Form behalten. Beim Versuch, sie in Empfang zu nehmen, fallen auch meine Handschuhe hinab. Der Mann nimmt sie auf und wirft sie mir entgegen. Sie werden riesengross. In dem Moment, wo ich sie auffange, sind sie wieder klein. (177 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2226 (1960-05-31 - Freiburg)Ich war im Kino zu einem Breitwandfilm. Irgendwie wurde das Leben einer offenbar sehr tüchtigen Familie gezeigt. Man sah eine Haustür mit Glasfenstern. Plötzlich klopften alle Zuschauer und machten Beifallskundgebungen. Ich sah, dass ihre Augen starr auf das Bild der Tür auf der Leinwand gerichtet waren, auch Emme's, die neben mir sass. Ich wunderte mich, denn ich sah nichts. Plötzlich entdeckte ich, dass man hinter der Scheibe der Glastür das Gesicht des Admirals sah, dem sie sozusagen als Nationalhelden zuklopften. Er sah mich strafend an. Ich klopfte widerwillig auch etwas. Dann sah er mich wieder strafend an. Ich bemerkte jetzt, dass alle um mich die Hand irgendwie zum Gruss gehoben hatten. Ich hob widerwillig meine Hand auch ein wenig. Man sah die Figur auch hinter der Tür gestikulieren. Es war ein Gesicht mit Bärtchen. Auch die Frau des Mannes war zu sehen. Sie waren die Eltern der tüchtigen Familie, von der der Film handelte. Ich war irgendwie gebannt von der Erscheinung, ohne mir richtig darüber klar zu werden, dass es ja daran lag, dass der Admiral ja in Wirklichkeit längst tot sei. Schliesslich bemerkte ich im Kinoraum eine Frau, die eine Platte mit Essen hatte und von den Kellnerinnen noch mehr Fleisch verlangte, das in dieser Sorte aber alle war. Ich war erstaunt, bis ich merkte, dass das Kino bereits leer war, bis auf eine Reihe von Leuten, die jetzt mit Essensplatten in den Reihen sassen. Es war eine Art Esskino. Die eigentlichen Zuschauer waren schon herausgegangen, ohne dass ich es in meinem gehemmten Zustand bemerkt hatte. Emme stand, auf mich wartend, im Hintergrund. (264 words)

Besonders ein Mädchen in grossem, dickwolligem Pullover gefiel mir sehr gut. Sie war, glaube ich, Königin von Sachsen. Eine andere, eine Tänzerin, sah ihr sehr ähnlich. - Einen Autounfall sah ich später auf der Strasse. Drei Autos waren zusammen-gefahren. Ein Mann lag verletzt in seinem Auto. (68 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2229 (1960-06-10 - Freiburg)Ich lag mit Emme im Bett und sah plötzlich zwei Schlangen in unserem Bett, die sich in züngelnden Bewegungen begatteten und jeden Moment Emme, die noch im Halbschlaf lag, beissen konnten. Ich überlegte, ob ich Emme anrufen sollte, damit sie schnell aus dem Bett hinausspringen konnte, oder ob ich versuchen sollte, die Schlangen mit der Wolldecke aus dem Bett heraus zu schieben. Bei diesen Überlegungen wachte ich auf. - Es waren Kupfernattern. (72 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2230 (1960-06-11 - Freiburg)In meinem Zimmer war ein Wildschwein. Ich schloss schnell die Tür und entwich in ein Nachbarzimmer, von wo man das Wildschwein noch durch eine Glasscheibe sehen konnte. Dann ging ich durch ein nächstes Zimmer auf die hintere Bodentreppe, denn ich hatte mein Zimmer auf dem Dachboden eines grossen Gutshauses. Dem ersten Mann, dem ich im Treppenhaus begegnete, sagte ich: "Ein Wildschwein ist in meinem Zimmer". Er lachte nur. Ebenso der nächste. Alle hielten es nur für einen guten Scherz. Schliesslich kam ein Mann mit einer Försterjacke. Er war noch nicht lange hier. Auch er hielt es nur für einen Scherz, aber ich konnte ihn überzeugen. Wir stiegen erst die Bodentreppe herauf, die direkt zu meinem Zimmer führte. Aber dort war keine Glasscheibe in der Tür. Er zog es darum vor, die andere Treppe zu gehen, damit wir das Wildschwein durch die Glasscheibe sehen konnten. Ich sah daran, dass er die Sache ernst nahm und mir das Wildschwein glaubte. Wir stiegen die Treppe hinauf, und gerade, als wir in den Vorraum kamen, wo ich zunächst viele Türen sah und nicht wusste, welche die richtige war, wachte ich auf. (187 words)

Es kamen komische biologische Gebilde dabei heraus, die aber lebten. Man sah die Entstehung in einer Weise, die an Metamorphosen erinnerte. Neben mir auf der anderen Seite sass ein Mädchen, die sehr versunken zusah. Sie hatte sich ganz weit zurückgelegt und ihre Beine etwas angezogen. Ich hatte das Selbe getan, so dass unsere Beine dabei aneinander lagen. (73 words)

Ich tastete mit der Hand auf ihrer nackten Haut den Rippenbogen ab, der irgendwie für sie charakteristisch war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2234 (1960-08-11 - Freiburg)Bettina war zweimal da. Die eine hatte das blaue Samtkleid an, lief herum und sah so aus, wie Bettina jetzt ist. Die andere hatte ich auf dem Arm. Sie hatte das rosa Jäckchen an und war etwas jünger. Die Leute hielten die eine, die ich auf dem Arm hatte, für eine Halluzination von mir. Ich wusste, dass sie das Kind nicht sehen, das ich auf dem Arm hatte, und konnte mir vorstellen, wie es für sie aussehen musste, wenn ich mit leeren Armen so da stand, als ob ich ein Kind auf dem Arm hätte, und wusste, dass sie mich deswegen für verrückt hielten. Andererseits hatte ich sie aber ganz mit Fleisch und Blut auf dem Arm, und sie schmiegte sich an mich und war so wirklich und lebendig da, dass ich ihr spontan einen Kuss geben musste. Ich wusste aber zugleich wieder, dass es für die Leute jetzt so aussehen musste, als hätte ich in die leere Luft geküsst. Die herumlaufende Bettina im blauen Kleid dagegen wurde auch von ihnen gesehen. (172 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2235 (1960-08-13 - Freiburg)Ich begegnete Christian Ferber auf der Strasse. Er schob einen Kinderwagen von seinem Kleinen, eine Sportkarre, wo vorne an der Stange noch ein Klappsitzchen für das zweite Kind angebracht war. Wir unterhielten uns über den Wagen, und ich sagte, dass an der selben Stelle bei uns ein Netz angebracht sei, in das wir bei grossen Spaziergängen alle unsere Sachen, Kleidungsstücke u. s. w. tun könnten, und dass das sehr praktisch sei. Wir überlegten, ob man beides an einem Wagen befestigen könnte, und er sagte, dass man den Klappsitz nur dort vorne unterbringen könnte, weil sonst die Gewichtsverteilung nicht richtig sei. So müsste man dann das Netz vielleicht hinten anbringen. In diesem Gespräch waren wir vor seiner Wohnung angekommen, und er lud mich ein, hinein zu kommen. Ich stellte, als wir auf das Haus zugingen, noch irgend eine Frage über die Wohnung, ob sie abgeschlossen sei und wieviel Räume sie habe, und er war erstaunt, dass ich das nicht wusste. Dabei fiel mir ein, dass ich es eigentlich schon wusste. Wir traten in das Haus ein. Ich ging mit Gisela den unteren Flur des Hauses entlang. Es war mein Elternhaus in Schwerin. Doch habe ich im Traum weder den Wandel der Person, noch den des Hauses überhaupt bemerkt. Aus Christian war ganz einfach Gisela geworden und aus dem Haus mein Elternhaus. Aber das war im Traum nicht einmal ein Wandel, sondern es ging einfach so weiter, ohne dass mir irgend ein Unterschied aufgefallen wäre. Man kann das im Wachen gar nicht richtig wiedergeben, weil man sich eine solche Veränderung ohne, dass man sie bemerkte, garnicht vorstellen kann. - Gisela ging einfach den Flur weiter geradeaus und an der Treppe vorbei, so dass sie in die Wohnung der Hauswirtin geriet. Ich rief sie lächelnd zurück. (293 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2236 (1960-08-30 - Freiburg)Ich war heimlich mit Marion zusammen. Als ihr Mann kam, der im Traum anders aussah als in Wirklichkeit, war ich schon wieder aus ihrem Bett geschlüpft und in meines gegangen, das in einem Nachbarzimmer stand. Die Türen zwischen den Zimmern waren angelehnt. Es war ein langer Traum mit vielen Szenen. Ich betastete mit den Händen die nackte Haut ihres Oberkörpers und folgte mit den Fingern der Linie ihres Rippenbogens. - Aus den letzten Tagen erinnere ich noch einen anderen Traum, in dem ich mit Emme und Marion in einem Bad war. Ihre Kabinen waren so, dass ich irgendwie durch die Luken oder Fenster hindurchsehen konnte, und zwar aus meiner Kabine in Emmes und durch Emmes hindurch in Marions. Emme stand da in einem durchsichtigen Kleid, und von Marions Kabine konnte ich eigentlich nur den oberen Teil sehen, sie machte aber eine Art Turnübung an einer Stange, wie einen Aufzug am Reck, und streckte ihre Beine, um sich hoch zu ziehen, in die Höhe, so dass erst ihre nackten Unterschenkel, erschienen, dann ihre Oberschenkel, von denen der Rock nach unten zurückfiel. Dabei kam etwas Merkwürdiges zum Vorschein: Auf ihrem Oberschenkel war eine ganze Stadt eintätowiert. Zuerst sah ich nur dunkle und helle Flächen, wie ein abstraktes Schattenmuster, dann erkannte ich die Häuserreihe, die in sich eine gewisse Einheit bildete und an den Marstall in Schwerin erinnerte. Ich wusste nun im Traum, warum sie oft verhältnismässig lange Röcke trägt. Sei wollte diese Tätowierung nicht zeigen. (243 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2237 (1960-09-06 - Freiburg)Vorgestern in Freiburg anderer Traum: Ich war mit einem nackten Mädchen zusammen. Im Spiegel sah ich das Gesicht eines anderen Mädchens, die sich irgendwie zu mokieren schien. Ihr Gesicht hatte etwas Freches, das zum Angriff herausforderte. Ich drehte mich um. Das andere Mädchen war ebenfalls nackt. Ich stürzte mich in einem Anfall von Wut auf sie, die in Leidenschaft überging, und schlug mit meinen Fäusten auf ihren nackten Körper ein. Das andere Mädchen, mit dem ich eigentlich zusammen war, stand dabei aber noch zwischen uns, und ich schob es dabei mit meinem Körper an das andere Mädchen, auf das ich einschlug, heran. Mein Glied richtete sich an ihrem nackten Gesäss auf. Wir stürzten zu dritt auf den Boden, wo wir uns nackt zu einem Knäuel von Leidenschaft zusammenballten, und ich wachte auf. Zuvor war ich in diesem Traum mit Marion in Heidelberg zusammen gewesen. Auch hier war sie irgendwie nackt. (150 words)

Man hatte mir gesagt, dass er nicht gefallen sei, wie alle dachten, sondern noch lebte und in der Stadt ein Antiquitätengeschäft habe. Ich traf ihn. Er war verheiratet und hatte eine etwas dickliche sehr nette Frau. Die Wohnung war voller wunderschöner Antiquitäten. Vom Haus aus führte eine Brücke weg über einen Meeresarm oder einen breiten Fluss. Aber Jürgen war irgendwie traurig. Schliesslich erfuhr ich, warum. Er hatte zwei Söhne, von denen der eine nach einem Ausflug und einem Bad verschwunden war. Die Mutter nahm zwar an, dass er nur ausgerissen sei, aber Jürgen fürchtete, er könne ertrunken sein, und war sehr traurig. (109 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2242 (1960-09-19 - Nagold)Die grossen Steine, die ich gestern für versteinertes Holz hielt und später nur für Wellenoberflächen des Meeresbodens, entpuppten sich als sehr grosse Muscheln. Die rindenartige Struktur überdeckte nur die Muschelstruktur. Die Muschel, die sehr gross war und versteinert, hing am Stil einer lebendigen blühenden Rose wie eine Frucht. - In einer anderen Traumszene Gang mit Emme durch die Stadt Freiburg. Wir trugen riesige versteinerte Muscheln mit uns, die wir keine weiteren Wegstrecken tragen konnten, weshalb wir sie immer wieder in derStadt versteckten und wieder holten. So waren sie einmal in einem Garten, gegen Abend. Ich wusste, dass wir damit noch zu Dr. Enke mussten, der in Lehen wohnt. Ein andermal hatte Emme sie in einer alten, nicht mehr gebrauchten Strassenbahn versteckt. Nun sahen wir aber eine solche - schon durch Unfälle verbeulte Strassenbahn wieder in Betrieb und mussten deshalb unsere Muscheln schnell retten. Die Muscheln lagen nun auf der Strasse vor einem Schaufenster, in dem auch Muscheln, aber kleinere, sorgfältig präparierte Versteinerungen, ausgestellt waren. Emme sagte, es sei das einzige Geschäft, das Muscheln habe. Bettina klopfte mit einem Steinchen auf eine unserer auf der Strasse liegenden Muscheln, die sehr gross war. Ich fürchtete, sie würde sie kaputt machen, aber es lösten sich nur die überdeckenden Kalkschichten, so dass die Struktur der riesigen Muschel noch besser zum Vorschein kam. Ich tastete mit Genuss mit den Fingern darüber. (226 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2243 (1960-09-26 - Freiburg)Traum von Romy. Sie hatte nicht zwei sondern vier Augen, die mit einem wunderbaren tiefen Veilchenviolett leuchteten. Und zwar war es so, dass in jedem Augapfel zwei Pupillen waren. Das gab dem Blick etwas Faszinierendes. Ich schaute ihr tief in die Augen hinein und entdeckte dabei, dass es vier waren, während mir vorher das gar nicht klar geworden war. Aber, was mich so faszinierte, war nicht dies, sondern das herrliche tiefe Veilchenblau, in das man ganz tief hineinsinken konnte, und es lag in diesem Blick ein tiefes Einverständnis, in das wir ganz versunken waren. Wir wollten zusammen nach Norden fahren. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2245 (1960-10-18 - Freiburg)Traum von einem Wecker, der gleichzeitig ein Radio war. Man brauchte nur hinten einen Hebel umlegen und konnte dann die Zeiger als Skaleneinsteller und Anzeiger benutzen. Diese Doppeldeutigkeit der Sache war aber im Traum etwas verwirrend. Es war ein Morgentraum nach erneutem Einschlafen nach dem Erwachen. Ich träumte auch, ich sei in die Küche gegangen, sah aber dort die Bilder der Löwen, die auf dem Bord neben meinem Bett stehen, ganz hoch über mir auf dem Küchenschrank stehen. Ich schloss daraus, dass ich also nicht wirklich in die Küche gegangen war, sondern noch in meinem Bett läge, wo man im Liegen die Löwen aus einem solchen Blickwinkel sieht, und den Gang in die Küche nur geträumt hatte. Dann erzählte ich Emme von diesem Traum vom Traum. - Dann wachte ich richtig auf und merkte, dass ich auch die Erzählung vom Traum vom Traum nur geträumt hatte. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass bei diesen späten Morgenträumen viele Stunden vergangen seien. (159 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2246 (1960-11-02 - Freiburg)Emme hatte einen schwarzen Diamant. Es war ein Stein mit vielen kleinen schwarzen glitzernden Kristallen und einer dunklen schwarzen Grundsubstanz. Nichts war daran geschliffen. Er war sehr gross. Wenn man das Licht darauf fallen liess, glitzerte er herrlich tief schwarz. Ich hatte gar nichts von seiner Existenz gewusst. - Wir hatten irgend einen Streit gehabt. Emme warf etwas weg, dass es klirrend zersprang. Später sagte sie, dass es ein schwarzer Diamant gewesen sei. Ich stellte mir einen kleinen Stein darunter vor. Sie wollt nicht danach suchen. Ich tat es aber doch. Was ich fand, war dieses etwas kleiner als handspannen-grosse Gebilde aus schwarzem Gestein und schwarzen Kristallen. Was zersprungen war, war irgend etwas Anderes gewesen, worauf sie es geworfen hatte. Sie hatte den schwarzen Stein einmal von Jimmy Uncle, dem schwarzen Jazzdirigenten, bekommen. - Später ging der Traum irgendwie weiter. Ich traf mit einer der Schwestern Enckevort zusammen, die jetzt irgendwie mit dem schwarzen Stein zu tun hatten. - Zuletzt irrte ich nachts durch Wuppertal - das aber im Traum eine Grossstadt von den Ausmassen Hamburgs war, und suchte Giselas Wohnung, bis mir einfiel, dass sie ja jetzt in Harburg wohnt.

Ich erklärte ihm, warum ich hier sei, und er sagte mir, dass er ein Buch über "Die Seele" geschrieben habe und mich bitten wolle, es zu lesen, um zu sehen, ob es auch für Psychologen verständlich wäre, woraus ich entnahm, dass er mich kannte und wusste, dass ich auch Psychologie studiert habe. Im Hinausgehen fragte er mich: "Worüber arbeiten Sie?". Ich antwortete: "Über den Traum als Welt." Er zeigte sich sichtlich von dem Thema beeindruckt, das ihm schon durch en Titel in seiner Absicht einzuleuchten schien. (124 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2249 (1961-01-16 - Freiburg)Auf der Strasse stand ein Bündel Holz, aber nicht so klein, wie diese Bündel sonst sind (etwa 30 cm. hoch), sondern so hoch wie zwei Etagen des Nachbarhauses. Die Autos fuhren vorsichtig darum herum. Ich sah es aus dem Fenster und sagte zu Emme: "Hoffentlich fährt kein Auto dagegen. Ob man die Polizei rufen müsste?" Da sah ich schon zwei Männer mit einen Zollstock an dem Bündel hantieren, das aussah wie ein grosser zweietagiger zylindrischer Pavillon. Plötzlich nahm der eine es unter den Arm und stellte es auf den Bürgersteig, wo es nun auf einmal so klein war, wie es normaler Weise ist. - Ich erzählte das Frau Schäfer, mit der ich schon vorher darüber gesprochen hatte, und sie sagte: "Ja, solche Spiegelungen gibt es manchmal" (126 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2251 (1961-01-19 - Freiburg)Roguszkas wohnten in einer Kirche - das heisst in einem Haus, das früher Kirche und jetzt Wohnung war -, die einen ovalen Grundriss mit kleeblattartigen Ausbuchtungen hatte. Irgendwann sagte Emme, mit der zusammen ich bei ihnen in der Wohnung war: "Dies ist eine homosexuelle Kirche". Sie spielte damit auf den Architekten an. Ich sagte: "Ganz im Gegenteil. Kuckt nur einmal heraus" - und schaute selber aus der Tür. Von aussen sah man, dass die Kirche, in der wir waren, mit einer ähnlichen, älteren, in strengen gotischen Formen, durch einen Brückengang verbunden war, der nur eine schmale Gasse zwischen ihnen liess. Es war klar, dass diese Form eine weiblich männliche Bedeutung, die des Koitus, hatte, und ich setzte dieses Verstehen ohne weiteres auch bei den Anderen voraus. Ich ging noch ein Stück aus der Pforte, aus der ich geschaut hatte, heraus, einen Weg, der zu der Kirche hinaus führte und gangartig umzäunt war. Als ich zurück zur Kirche und den Anderen, wollte, merkte ich, dass durch eine Art Stahlmechanismus sich ein Dach über einen senkte (auf den Weg), das so tief herabkam, dass es einen auf die Strasse stiess, wenn man darunter gehen wollte, - wenn man nicht sehr schnell und energisch drauf los ging. Es schien auf das eigene Verhalten zu reagieren. Als ich einmal nicht darunter gekommen war, zog ein anderer Mechanismus mich unter den Füssen zurück, wie wenn der Weg rückwärts liefe und von der Kirche weg - immer weiter -, um dann später umzukehren und das Spiel mit dem Dach erneut beginnen zu lassen. So war die Annäherung an die Kirche durch diesen Stahlgang erschwert. Ich wachte auf, ehe ich in die Kirche zurückkam. Die Szene wandelte sich jedoch vorher noch. In dem Raum, der der Gang gewesen war, lag unter dem Tisch meine Schwester und sprach etwas im Trance-Zustand. In einem Nebenraum (es war jetzt das Ganze ein Haus) war Tante Tabitha - ebenfalls in einem trance-ähnlichen Zustand -, deren Gedanken meine Schwester aussprach. Es bezog sich auf eine geplante Reise in dem Traum. - In der ersten Szene, von der oval runden Wohnung, die früher Kirche war, hatte ich aus dem Fenster noch eine dritte Kirche gesehen, eine Art alte Renaissance-Kirche, die wir schon oft auf Spaziergängen gesehen hatten und die am Waldrand des Schönbergs, bzw. eines ähnlichen Waldes, lag. Da wusste ich aber nicht von der anderen, direkt mit dem Hause verbundenen Kirche und dem Brückengang. Hinter jener dritten Kirche war ein kanalartiger Fluss mit Schiffen darauf. Diese Landschaft war uns von Spaziergängen vertraut. - In einer davonfliegenden Szene waren wir schon in dem Wald gewesen, der eine Lichtung hatte mit einer durch viele Erdschichten gehenden Grube. Kinder spielten dort und sprangen ziemlich hoch in den sandigen Boden herab. Das beunruhigte mich und ich zog Emme fort, um nicht zu erleben, dass eines sich verletzte. (471 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2252 (1961-01-29 - Freiburg)Marion hatte ein Kleid an, das vorne bis unter den Bauchnabel ausgeschnitten war. Der Ausschnitt war unter der Brust durch einen Steg zusammengehalten und war so breit, dass man die Formen des nackten Körpers, auch des Bauches und der Linien über der Scham, darin erkennen konnte. Dieser Körper hatte ein starkes Leben und Beweglichkeit. Ich drückte sie an mich. - In einer anderen Szene fuhr ich mit Emme in einem ganz leichten, wohl zweirädrigen, Karren, der von einem Pferd gezogen war, in eine Stadt hinein, an deren Rand herrliche griechische Bauwerke und Gebäude aus späteren Zeiten (wohl dem Barock) lagen, die man in der Fahrt wunderbar daliegen sah. Es war die Stadt, in der wir lebten, und ich genoss dieses Bewusstsein bei dem Anblick sehr. Später fuhren wir über eine aus einigen kleinen Stufen gebildete Schwelle der Strasse herab. Der Wagen kam dabei an den Strassenrand und stürzte um, doch so langsam, dass wir uns nichts taten. Man konnte sich noch im Fall so einrichten, dass man sich nicht stiess. Doch meine Sorge galt dem Pferd, das vielleicht bei dieser Gelegenheit durchgehen konnte. Ich rief darum Emme, die vorne gesessen und kutschiert hatte, zu: "Vorsicht die Pferde!". Ich ergriff das Pferd beim Zaum und führte es, nachdem der Wagen aufgestellt war, weiter. Doch das Pferd war nun ganz störrisch, drohte mit den Hufen nach mir zu schlagen und konnte das auch irgendwie sagen, indem es eine Drohung ausstiess. Dann fing es an, mich in die Hand zu beissen, noch ohne ernsthaft zu zu beissen. Ich versuchte, es zu beruhigen, und. ich redete vorsichtig auf es ein. Doch nun wurde es launisch, und, je sanfter ich mit ihm sprach, desto mehr begann es zu beissen und ging nicht weiter. Da schrie ich es einfach an, und siehe da, es biss nicht mehr und folgte mir willig. (305 words)

Heidegger kam mir aus entgegengesetzter Richtung in dem Gang entgegen, so dass wir uns begegnen mussten. Es war seit Jahren das erste mal, das wir uns wiedersehen. Heidegger ass gerade etwas und kaute mit vollen Backen. Zur gleichen Zeit sprach er mich an, so dass ich kein Wort verstand. Ich überlegte, ob ich nun sagen sollte, dass ich ihn nicht verstehen konnte, oder nicht. Mit dieser Überlegung wachte ich auf. (83 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2255 (1961-04-26 - Freiburg)Kam mit der Strassenbahn aus der Richtung Günterstal in die Stadt und stieg am Bertholdsbrunnen aus. Alle Autos standen merkwürdig unbeweglich da. Man sah keine Menschen. Direkt an der Kreuzung stand ein Leichenwagen. Wir schauten im Vorbeigehen in die Führerkabine und sahen, dass auch der Fahrer tot war. Jetzt bogen wir um die Ecke und sahen auch die Salzstrasse und alle anderen Strassen, die zur Kreuzung führten, angefüllt mit haltenden Fahrzeugen. Es war merkwürdig still. In allen Fahrzeugen waren die Insassen tot. Nirgends mehr regte sich etwas Lebendiges ausser mir und den zwei, drei Insassen, die mit mir in der Strasenbahn in die Stadt gekommen waren. Die Stadt musste von Atomstrahlen befallen worden sein- wir waren hier die letzten Überlebenden. Mich befiel der Gedanke: Nur so schnell wie möglich nach Hause, um wenigstens Emme noch einmal zu sehen. Ich eilte durch die Salzstrasse, klappte den Mantelkragen hoch und hoffte, noch so weit wie möglich, möglichst bis nach Hause, zu kommen, ehe mich auch die tödlichen Strahlen befielen. Erwachen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2256 (1961-08-04 - Nagold)Ein Hund, der im Feuer lebt, kommt aus einer Höhle in einem Spalt im Felsen. Vorher: Eine weisse schaumartige Speise, die sich in grosser Schnelligkeit selbst vermehrt, wobei die Bewegung der sich vermehrenden und anwachsenden weissen Schaummasse übergeht in eine Ortsbewegung des Tellers, auf dem die Masse anwächst. Er gleitet an einer Felswand entlang, die sich an einer bestimmten Stelle aus einem Spalt zu einer klaffenden Höhle auftut, aus der eine heisse brodelnde rote Masse von Tomatenfarbe hervordringt. Wir fürchten, dass sie unsere weisse Speise überfliesst, doch der Teller gleitet gerade noch in seiner eleganten Bewegung an der Höhle vorbei. Nun aber tritt das Tier, ein grosser Schäferhund (der aussieht wie die Wölfe in Basel) aus der Höhle hervor, wo er immer im Feuer lebt, und droht die weisse Speise zu fressen. Ich trete dem Tier entgegen, um die weisse Speise zu retten, und schaue ihm in die Augen, die mich gefährlich, aber nicht böse, ansehen.

Ich kriegte wegen irgend etwas einen Wutanfall und trampelte mit den Beinen furchtbar auf dem Fussboden. Der Friseur, der gerade im Keller war, hörte es und dachte, sein Lehrling wäre es gewesen. Er entliess den Lehrling, obwohl der versicherte, er habe nicht getrampelt Ich lief nach vorne und sagte dem Friseur: "Ich habe getrampelt. Er hat wirklich nicht getrampelt. Ich bitte um Entschuldigung." - Eine Friseurin, die dabei war und der der Lehrling leid tat, bedankte sich, dass ich es gesagt hätte. Erwachen. (98 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2261 (1962-07-19 - Freiburg)Ich war in einem Haus, das Tante Tabitha gehörte. Es stand in einer leicht bergigen grünen Landschaft und war wohl eine Art Sommer- oder Ferienhaus. Dieses Haus stand jetzt direkt an einer Grenze zwischen West und Ost, an einem "eisernen Vorhang". Die Grenze lief genau an der Rückwand des Hauses entlang, und wenn man aus dem Wohnzimmer eine Tür, die sich in der Mitte dieser Rückwand befand, öffnete, trat man direkt in östliches Gebiet. Das war gefährlich. Der sehr lange Dr. Rennemann, der mit mir in dem Hause war, sprang durch diese Tür hinaus und lief schnell hinten am Haus entlang und um die Ecke herum wieder in westliches Gebiet zurück. Man war wohl drüben auf diese Bewegung aufmerksam geworden. Etwas später öffnete ich die Tür, um in den grünen Garten der im Osten lag, hinauszuschauen. Die Tür schlug ganz auf, als ob sie gezogen wurde. Ich streckte mich aus, um die Klinke zu fassen und die Tür wieder zu schliessen, stand dabei aber noch auf der Schwelle. Da wurde von draussen meine Hand gepackt und man versuchte, mich hinauszuziehen. Ich begriff sofort, dass sich jemand hinter der Tür versteckt hatte, der sie auch, als ich sie geöffnet hatte, ganz aufgezogen hatte, und der nun versuchte, mich in den Osten herüberzuziehen. Ich stemmte mich dagegen und sah gerade Emme in das Zimmer hereinkommen. Ich rief ihr zu: "Zieh mich zurück," und streckte ihr meine andere, noch freie Hand entgegen, und erwachte. (Der Wecker hatte kurz vorher geklingelt und ich war noch einmal eingeschlafen. Ein anderer Traum war diesem vorhergegangen (wohl auch schon nach dem Weckerklingeln) : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Traum: Ich stand in einem Gelände, durch das sich die Grenze zwischen Ost und West hinzog. Die westliche Seite lag noch in hellem Sonnenlicht, die östliche Seite aber in tiefem nächtlichem Schatten. Eine Strasse lief schräg über diese Grenze, eine andere kam seitlich, ebenfalls schräg, herzu: Auf der Strasse herrschte Verkehr, wenn auch ein nicht sehr reger. Die Autos konnten ungehindert über die Grenze fahren. Wenn sie aus dem Osten kamen, tauchten sie genau an der Grenze in das Tageslicht ein, kamen sie aus dem Westen, fuhren sie in das Dunkel hinein. Die Landschaft sah mit der strengen und übergangslosen Trennung von Licht und dämmerigem Schatten geheimnisvoll und magisch aus - ähnlich wie auf einem surrealistischen Bild. Ich war fasziniert von diesem Anblick. Da sah ich eine Radfahrerin, die ihr Rad ziemlich mit allerlei Sachen beladen hatte, aus dem dunklen Osten kommend langsam an die Grenze heranfahren. Ihre Bewegung war dabei tastend und langsam, als ob sie eigentlich im Osten bleiben wollte. Dann bog sie an der Grenze plötzlich scharf ab und fuhr schnell in den Westen hinein. Ich dachte zuerst. dass sie im Osten zu Hause war und fliehen wollte, dann aber fuhr sie im Westen an einen Bürgersteig heran, auf dem ich nun stand. Am Rand des Bürgersteigs waren Häuser, und ich sah jetzt, dass die Radfahrerin ihr Rad mit Blumen beladen hatte. Sie trug ziemlich weite graue Hosen, die sie wohl zur Arbeit anhatte, und mir wurde klar, dass es eine Gärtnerin war. Sie kam mir irgendwie bekannt vor. - Ich wusste im ersten Augenblick noch nicht, woher. Aus der Tür des Hauses kam ein Mann heraus, der ihr beim Abladen half und offensichtlich ihr Mann war. Das Haus hatte, glaube ich, auch eine Art Schaufenster, das es als Geschäft einer Gärtnerei erkennen liess. Sie trugen die Pflanzen herein. Das Rad war ziemlich beladen und sie hatten Schwierigkeiten dabei. Ich griff darum zu und half, einige Rollen, in denen irgend etwas verpackt war, mit hinein zu tragen. Ich wollte auch versuchen, herauszukriegen, woher ich das Mädchen kannte. Sie erinnerte mich vage an Heide, die ich aus Göttingen kannte. Heide war ein sehr hübsches Mädchen. Ich war durch das Hereintragen mit in das Haus gekommen, in einen Raum, der wohl als Arbeits- und Aufbewahrungsraum für die Blumengärtnerei diente. Ich wollte schon die junge Frau fragen, war mir aber meiner Sache nicht sicher und genierte mich etwas. Sie war aber in einen hinteren Raum, wohl eine Art Küche, gegangen, und ich sagte zu dem Mann: "Ihre Frau kommt mir irgendwie bekannt vor, sie erinnert mich an ein Mädchen, das ich früher in Göttingen kennen lernte und das Heide hiess." Ich merkte schon an seinem Gesichtsausdruck, dass ich mich nicht geirrt hatte. Er fragte aber noch zurück: "Wann war das?" Ich dachte darüber nach, dass ich Heide als Giselas Freundin kennen gelernt hatte und dass ich Gisela 1949 kennen gelernt hatte. 1949 war das Jahr, wo ich ganz mit Gisela zusammengewesen war, und ich nannte darum diese Jahreszahl. Der Mann liess irgendwie durchblicken, dass ich Recht hatte, ohne es direkt auszusprechen. offenbar zögerte er noch, ob es gut sei, wenn Heide an diese Zeit erinnert wurde - Ich war aber schon ziemlich entschlossen, Heide anzusprechen, und erwachte. - In dem Gespräch hatte ich noch irgendwie erfahren, dass sie als Gärtnerin ungehindert über die Grenze und zurück fahren konnte, um dort drüben Pflanzen zu holen (Nach diesem Traum wurde ich wohl kurz etwas wach und schlief wieder ein. Danach kam dann der zweite, zuerst aufgeschrieben Traum: Nach dem zweiten und endgültigen Erwachen, bemerkte ich, dass ich den Wecker schon 10 Minuten überschlafen hatte, obwohl ich ihn gehört hatte und wohl kurz aufgewacht war).

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2262 (1962-11-06 - Freiburg)Eine Frau hatte ein Kind getötet. Es stand in einem ganz kleinen schwarzen Sarg auf dem Tisch. Sie war völlig verzweifelt und hatte ganz starre Augen. Ich nahm sie in die Arme und tröstete sie. - Später war ich in einer Umgebung, die der des Divo-Instituts in Frankfurt glich, oder das Divo-Institut war. Mehrere der Leute waren in einem treppenhausartigen Vorraum. Es war etwas aufregendes passiert. Sie öffneten eine Aufzugtür und zum Vorschein kam eine schon aufgebahrte Leiche einer jungen Frau oder eines jungen Mädchens. - Ich mochte nicht hinsehen. Die Figur der feingliedrigen Frau wirkte sehr starr. Sie richtete sich zum Sitzen auf, um zu sehen, ob sie wirklich tot war. Die Figur blieb starr sitzen und sie sahen daran, das sie tot war. - Es kam mir aber merkwürdig vor, dass ich den Eindruck hatte, dass sie den nackten, oder nur mit einer leichten Sandale bekleideten Fuss leicht durchstreckte, so wie es nur eine Frau tut, die photographiert wird oder Gymnastik macht. - Plötzlich merkte ich, dass die starre Figur irgendwie die Augen bewegte. Sie hob ganz langsam den nackten schmalen weissen Arm mit den sehr feingliedrigen fächerförmig ausgestreckten Händen. Es war, als wenn eine Leiche wieder lebendig wird. - Die Augen hatten immer noch einen starren Ausdruck und wirkten merkwürdig schwarz und verlaufen - aber die Frau war lebendig. Ich war nach dem Erwachen sehr beeindruckt von diesem Traum. Die Figuren der beiden Frauen hatten in ihrer unheimlichen Starrheit eine grosse Ähnlichkeit. Ich glaube, dass ich die totgewesene Frau auch in den Armen hatte, kann mich aber an dieses Traumstück nicht mehr genau erinnern. Ich habe nur die Erinnerung an die unheimliche Starrheit und doch zugleich feine Lebendigkeit des Körpers, den ich in den Armen hatte, vor allem an die weissen Arme und die gespreizten Hände mit den unendlich feingliedrigen Fingern, die zugleich einer Toten und einer Lebenden anzugehören schienen, und an die Augen, die so merkwürdig dunkel mit grossen schwarzen, nicht scharf begrenzten Pupillen und doch zugleich ausdrucksvoll und wieder sehend waren. Auf der ganzen Figur lag noch der Schrecken des Todes, und sie war noch merkwürdig kalt und doch zugleich zerbrechlich in meinen Armen. (359 words)

Ich sagte ihm das ziemlich unverblümt: Zuerst war er ungehalten. Später blieb ich aber in seiner Wohnung und half ihm, diese einrichten. Er war in einen Neubau eingezogen. Es waren viele Schubladen und Kästen darin. - Dann war der Papst gestorben und ein neuer Papst kam, bei dem ich ebenfalls blieb. Dieser neue Papst stammte aus dem Osten und hiess Agaganjahn. Er hatte eine Ostkrone, die etwas flacher und breiter als die Papstkrone war, und wollte nun die Tiara da drüber setzen - Das sah aber nicht gut aus, und ich sagte das. Es wurden dann verschiedene Kombinationen ausprobiert, wobei ich auch einmal die Ostkrone aufsetzte. Der neue Papst zog etwas ironisch die vielen Schubladen und Schachteln auf. Er sagte, er stamme ja aus einer protestantischen Umgebung im Norden. Dann stellte ich fest, dass der neue Papst auch eine Frau hatte - eine Art first lady -, denn in seinem Zweig der Kirche durften die Priester auch heiraten. (173 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2269 (1971-07-11 - Zürich)Drei Träume aus dem Jahr 1971, nämlich: 2269 A: aus dem Mai 71; 2669 B: vom 26.6.1971 und 2269 C: vom 11.7.1971. - - - Zuerst Traum 2269 A vom Mai 71:: Dieser Traum ist nicht als Text geschrieben sondern als Zeichnung, mit einzelnen Worten wie ein Comicstrip: "I. Scene:" Links auf dem querliegenden Blatt sieht man eine offene Tür hinter der im Inneren eines anderen Raums ein schattenhafter schwarzer Mann mit Hut steht, und links von dieser Tür ein Mädchen sich nähern. Neben dem Mädchen steht "Bille" und über der offenen Tür "Mann hinter der Tür" Auf der rechten Seite sieht man m a unteren Bildrand Oberkörper und Kopf eines Mannes von hinten (als ob er von unten in das Bild hereinragt, auf dessen Rücken "Ich" steht. Von seinem Mund geht eine Sprechblase aus: "Bille mach doch auf". Von seinem Kopf geht eine Gedankenblase aus, über dem Kopf: "Bille hört nicht",. Ganz rechts in der Ecke ist ein bettartiges Gebilde noch teilweise zu sehen, auf dem steht: "M. schläft". Auf dem zweiten Blatt steht oben rechts: "Traum, II.Scene". Hier sieht man links in der offenen Tür eine Hand mit Pistole, ebenso schattenhaft wie vorher den ganzen Man, und rechts die Figur, die vorher mit Ich bezeichnet war, knien und, wie aus der Sprechblase hervorgeht, schreien: "Muuuh". Darunter steht "2x", also: Zweimal geschrien. Rechts sieht man wieder das nur am Rand erkennbare Bett mit einer sich aufrichtenden Figur die sagt "Dellev?", wie aus der Sprechblase hervorgeht, und über der Figur steht "M. aufgewacht. - Damals ebensowenig Einfälle wie Text aufgeschrieben, sondern nur die Zeichnung mir den einzelnen Worten und Namen. Ich glaube mich jetzt, 25 Jahre später 1996 aber wieder dunkel an die Sache zu erinnern. Ich glaube, ich hatte geträumt, dass ein Mann an der Tür war und ich gesagt hatte: Bille mach doch auf, während Emme noch schlief. Dann aber hatte sich der Mann der Tür als Einbrecher mit Pistole entpuppt und ich hatte um ihn zu erschrecken und ihn abzuwehren ganz laut Muuuh geschrienen. In diesem Schrei war ich aufgewacht und ebenso Emme, die neben mir in ihren Bett schlief, weil ich wirklich eine solchen unartikulierte Laut hervorgestossen hatte, so dass sie fragend sagte "Dellev?". Es war ein Agsttraum bei dem ich den Schrei nicht nur geträumt, sondern wirklich artikuliert hatte, so dass Emme ihn hörte Das nur am Rand zu sehende Bett mit der schlafenden und dann erwachenden den Emme gehört also wohl nicht zum Trauminhalt sondern zum Traumumfeld, wenigstens in der zweiten Szene. Emme sagt nach Vorlesen dieser Nachschrift, dass sie sich auch noch daran erinnert. Offenbar hat die Zeit damals nicht gereicht, den Text zur Zeichnung noch zu schreiben, oder ich bin durch anderes abgelenkt worden. - - - - - - Zweitens: Traum 2669 B, Zürich, 26.6.1971:: Bei dieser Aufzeichnung ist nicht klar, ob ihr auch noch irgendwie ein neuer Traum zu Grunde liegt, oder ob sie sich nur auf die beiden früheren Träume 2267 und 2268, vom 15. und 25.4.71, bezieht, von denen sie unter anderem handelt.(Eigentlich ein selbständiger Text): Am 25.6.71 kurz vor 17 Uhr, als ich im Trolleybus sass, fiel mir plötzlich unvermittelt ein, dass ich mich nicht auf den Namen des Mannes besinnen konnte, den ich in Kreuzlingen kennengelernt hatte und der im Sommer nach Zürich kommen wollte. -Wie peinlich würde das sein, wenn er jetzt vor uns stünde und ich könnte ihn nicht anreden. - Dann kam mir der Titel seines Buches in den Sinn und ich dachte: Wenn ich diesen fixiere, kommt der Name von selbst. Ich dachte also an "The phenomenological movement". Dann kamen plötzlich zwei Erinnerungen zugleich, völlig gleichzeitig und fast identisch, sein Name und der Satz in einem Traum vor einiger Zeit, der mich so beschäftigt hatte: "Herbert Spiegelberg" und "Herr Wolkenspiegel möchte Sie sprechen". Zugleich wurde mir klar, dass dieser Mann irgendwie in den Traum hineingewirkt hatte, dass ich von ihm ja in Kreuzlingen geträumt hatte und wir über mögliche zukünftige Träume über ihn gesprochen hatten. (Der Satz "Herr Wolkenspiegel" behielt zugleich seine frühere Verbindung zu Magritte). Drittens: Traum 2269 C: Zürich, 11.7.1971: (Dies der einzige verbale Traumtext dieser drei:): Traum: Satz beim Einschlafen: "Ist nicht gleich die Vertikale unüberblickbar" (697 words)

Der Satz war aus folgender Szene hervorgegangenen: Ein versteinertes - oder besser vereisentes - Gehirn war in einem Meteor gefunden worden. Es war ein grosses Menschenhirn und war so versteinert (bzw. vereisent), dass man das Grosshirn von den älteren Hirnteilen trennen konnte, bzw. zwei Teile für sich auseinandernehmen konnte. Nun sollte das kostbare Gut aus dem Weltall an zwei verschiedenen Stellen - hier das Grosshirn, dort das Althirn - aufbewahrt werden. Das fand ich schade um die Einheit des Fundes.

Unten war aber Emme mit einem Kinderwagen. Wir selbst hatten ein neues Baby, das darin war.. Dann war noch ein zweites Baby da, das das Baby unseres Babys war. Ich nahm unser Baby auf den Arm. Es war schmal und etwas erschöpft von der Entbindung seines Babys, während sein Baby viel runder und rosiger war. Aber es war klar, dass der Unterschied nur davon kam, dass das erste Baby gerade eine eigene Entbindung mitgemacht hatte. ich überlegte mir kurz, ob das Baby des Babys wohl gesundheitlich ganz in Ordnung sein könne, weil seine Mutter nicht erwachsen war, und überlegte dann - kurz vor dem Erwachen -, wann den das erste Baby so alt sein werde, dass es sein eigenes Baby aufziehen könne. Ich kam zu dem Schluss, dass das zweite Baby dann auch schon erwachsen sein würde, so dass wir also praktisch beide ganz gross ziehen mussten, und es so war, als ob wir in Wirklichkeit Zwillinge bekommen hätten.

Eine Ergotherapeutin sagt zu einem Mann, der hineigekommen war: Warum sagen Sie eigentlich immer, wenn Sie z.B. etwas aus dem Auto tragen, oder so etwas: "Auf nach Lauda". - Ich dachte, der Mann würde schnell antworten, weil es nur eine harmlose Frage zu sein schien. Er aber überlegte lächelnd und sagte nach einer Pause: "Weil es so frei und frisch klingt". - Ich sagte: " Das ist wirklich eine sehr gute Antwort", weil mir imponierte, wie er die wahre Antwort vermieden hatte. Ich trug einen langen Bambusstock, der aussah wie ein Peitsche. Der Philosoph Lübbe war in diesem Moment hereingekommen. Es war wie vor einer Fakultätssitzung. - Die Ergotherapeutin setzte das Gespräch über die Antwort des Mannes fort und sagte "und garnicht schizophren". - Dies schien mir ernst gemeint. Ich dachte darüber nach, was der Ort Lauda wohl bedeuten könnte. - Ich dachte dabei weiter über den Satz des Mannes nach - wie über den Satz eines Fremden. Es fiel mir nur ein, dass es ja einen Rennfahrer namens Lauda gibt, der im Auto verunglückte und in Flammen geriet. - Vielleicht heisst er auch nach einem Ort Lauda, der wohl in Oesterreich sein müsste. - Plötzlich ging mir auf, dass es ja mein Traum war, dass also ich den Namen Lauda erfunden hatte, dass die ganze Sache mich und nicht den fremden geträumten Mann etwas anging. Jetzt fiel mir ein, dass ich gestern in Readers Digest einen Artikel über Laudas Unfall gelesen hatte. Er war 45 Sekunden im Feuer gewesen. Nur die Gesichtsmaske hatte ihn geschützt. Er hatte giftige Dämpfe von brennendem Kunststoff eingeatmet. -Jetzt fiel mir wieder ein kurz zuvor geträumter Traum von einem Autounfall ein: Ich ging mit Emme auf der Strasse, an der es zu kritischen Überholmanövern kam, weil ein abgestellter Lastwagen die Strasse verengte. Emme hatte die gefährliche Strecke schon passiert - ich noch nicht. Ein Fahrer verlor die Herrschaft über sein Fahrzeug und fuhr frontal gegen eine Mauer. ich fürchtete, dass er tot war, und stand wie gelähmt da. Ein zweiter Fahrer bremste stark, wobei er sich um die eigene Achse drehte und ein Rad verlor, stieg aus, um dem Verunglückten zu Hilfe zu eilen. - Ich erwachte. In der Nacht vorher hatte ich geträumt, dass wir unser Haus auf eine merkwürdige Art renovieren wollten. Wir wollten erst Wasser in Kübel pumpen - das war schon geschehen. Dann das Haus innen anzünden und gleichzeitig das Wasser auslaufen lassen. Dadurch würde das Haus ausgeräumt und konnte neu eingerichtet werden. Ich bekam aber vor dem Feueranzünden doch Bedenken und liess es und erwachte mit dem Gedanken, dass man vielleicht das Wasser aus den Kübeln entfernen konnte wie Wein aus Fässern, indem man einen Schlauch hineinsteckte und absaugte. Dann liefe es durch den Schlauch auf die Strasse. (472 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2292 (1978-05-20 - Zürich)Zuerst in Nagold. Dort war in der Apotheke ein Mädchen namens Claudia, das ich als eine Studentin von mir erkannte. Dann in einer Art Schauspiel, das um eine Figur namens Claudia ging. Irgendwo sass in einer seitlichen Loge eine Richterin, die zum Spiel gehörte. Sie sprach die Worte: "Claudia steh auf." Elastisch richte sich ein gertenschlankes Mädchen wie im Schlaf oder Traumzustand gehorchend auf und wandte sich ihr zu. Sie war im Trancezustand, einer geheimnisvollen hohen Macht gehorchend und dabei bezaubernd. Es war ein Spiel um diese Claudia. (88 words)

Ich umarmte Julia und begann ihr die Unterhose abzusteifen. - Es war sehr schön. Ich sah sie einen Moment durch das feine Filigran der Uhr hindurch an und durch die pulsierend sich bewegende Unruhe.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2297 (1978-10-17 - London)Viele Träumer von Julia. Ich wachte nach jedem auf, merkte, dass ich von Julia geträumt hatte, schlief wieder ein und träumte erneut von Julia. In einem waren wir zusammen und am Schluss sagte sie mir: ich mache jetzt eine Mechaniker-Lehre. Es wird noch geprüft, welche Teile der Lehre ich machen muss. Sie dauert diesen Winter und noch in den nächsten Winter hinein. - In einem anderen Traum gingen wir zusammen durch die Stadt eng aneinander geschmiegt und unsere Bewegungen ganz aufeinander abgestimmt. In wieder einem andren Traum sahen wir eine Art Ballettübung. Sie kam in einem schwarzen Ballettanzug herein und mischte sich unter die Tänzer. Es war aber wie in einer Schule oder Internat und man gab ihr Befehle, die sie falsch fand. Sie fragte die Lehrerin nach ihrer Berechtigung und ihrem Ausweis. - Ich sagte " es geht ihr nicht gut" -, weil ich merkte, dass sie sich so unnötig Feinde machte. In wieder einem anderen Traum fand ich sie unglücklich in diesem Heim wieder. Ich nahm sie an die Hand und sagte: Du gehörst nicht hierher, und führte sie hinaus. (182 words)

Emme und ich gingen hinein und freuten uns über den zusätzlichen Raum. Aus dem Nachbarhaus hörten wir durch die Wand laute Musik. Als ich die Wand näher betrachtete, bemerkte ich, dass sie oben zwei Fenster hatte, die direkt ins Nachbarhaus führten. Ich konnte hineinschauen und einen Mann und sein Musikgerät sehen und mich mit ihm verständigen. Dann entdeckte ich, dass unten in der selben Wand noch einmal Fenster waren, die in die unteren Räume des Nachbarhauses führten. Dort war etwas wie eine Mühle oder ähnliches. Zuletzt erfuhren wir, dass in diesem Dorf Christoph Columbus geboren sei. Es war offenbar in Spanien. (123 words)

Es gab offenbar keine Möglichkeit, den Strom zu unterbrechen. Es ist das Fernsehgerät, dessen Ton wir oft störend durch die Wand hören. - Andere Szene: In unserer Küche begannen elektrische Geräte zu schmoren und zu rauchen. Es gelang mir nicht, sie abzustellen. Auch wenn ich alle Schalter ausstellte, ging es weiter. Ich zog die Leitung raus, auch das nützte nichts. Ich suchte und fand die Sicherung. Zuerst wusste ich nicht, welche Hebel oder Knöpfe man betätigen musste. Es war eine automatische Sicherung. Schliesslich betätigte ich nacheinander die Hebel. - Nichts nützte etwas. Ich riss die ganze Sicherung heraus, so dass der Strom ganz unterbrochen sein musste. Die Geräte schmorten und rauchten weiter. Ich wachte beunruhigt auf. (161 words)

Ich erinnerte mich, einmal in einer ganz schmalen Gasse, wo einen auf beiden Seiten die Hauswände berührten, mit ihr ins Bett gegangen zu sein. Es war eine sehr schöne Erinnerung und eine Atmosphäre und Umgebung, wo dies ganz selbstverständlich und natürlich war. Das Mädchen nannte seinen Namen. Es hiess Rademacher. Ich hatte den Namen vergessen. - Auch das war im Traum natürlich, weil die Zahl der Studenten so gross und der sexuelle Kontakt mit ihnen etwas vollkommen Natürliches war. Ich tat aber so, als ob ich den Namen noch wüsste. Ich fragte sie im Zusammenhang der Besprechung für eine Prüfung oder ähnliches, ob sie auch mit anderen Professoren hier schon gesprochen habe. - Es waren auch andere Psychologieprofessoren - doch nicht die hiesigen - im Raum.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2302 (1978-12-06 - Zürich)Emme und ich wollten aus dem Haus , in dem wir wohnten, durch die Kellertür nach draussen gehen. Aber ein Wachhund versperrte uns am Ende des langen Kellergangs den Ausgang. Er stand auf und lief drohend auf uns zu. Ich hielt einen Schirm oder Stock vor mich, den er ins Maul nahm, und schaute ihm, obwohl es in dem Kellergang dunkel war, so gut es ging, in die Augen. Wir gingen langsam rückwärts. An einer bestimmten Stelle, die wohl eine Art Reviergrenze war, kehrte der Hund um. Wir verliessen nun das Haus durch den Haupteingang auf der Vorderseite und umrundeten das Haus, um auf die Landstrasse zu gelangen. Hier begegneten wir wieder dem Hund, der mit seinem Herren spazierenging. Er kam freudig wedelnd wie ein alter Bekannter auf uns zugesprungen und war nun völlig ungefährlich. -- Anderer Traum: Ein riesiges scheibenförmiges Flugzeug, das aussah und auf dessen Oberfläche weissgekleidete Soldaten sassen, flog einen Louping. - Es war eine grausame Macht, der der Flugkörper gehörte. Die Soldaten durften sich nicht festhalten, sondern sollten durch die Fliehkraft gehalten werden. Das Flugzeug flog aber dafür zu langsam. Man sah die Gestalten vereinzelt wie weisse Schneeflocken herabfallen. (193 words)

Mit den Überlegungen über das Teekesselwort "Unterhaltung" wachte ich auf (in den drei Bedeutungen: 1) = Gespräch, 2) = Aufrechterhaltung, Versorgung, 3) = Zerstreuung Vergnügung. - Im Halbwachen fielen mir Sätze ein wie: Das Teekesselchen des Südwestfunks; Die Teekessel mit dem Wagenführer ist den Fahrgästen verboten.

Herr Strolz, der vorbeikam und unser Gespräch hörte, sagte: "Hier" (wir standen gerade vor einer Kirchentür - es war eine Topographie wie auf dem dreieckigen Neumarktplatz in Zürich): "Hier findet gerade die Kantate 'Die Wirklichkeit des Übersinnlichen' statt", und ging hinein. Er trug eine Art Priestergewand. - Ich wollte eigentlich nicht dorthin gehen, hörte aber dann laut seine Stimme von drinnen die Worte sagen "Die Wirklichkeit des Übersinnlichen" und merkte, dass er selbst diese Messe oder Kantate zelebrierte. Also sagte ich zu Ruth: "Dann muss ich jetzt hineingehen, damit er nicht enttäuscht ist", und ging hinein. Drinnen sass er mit einigen jungen Leuten um einen Tisch - es war ein Ritus, der in moderner Weise von den Beteiligten selbst vollzogen werden sollte. Er hatte eine Art grosse flache ovale Lampe, die aber gleichzeitig eine Harfe oder Zitter war, und reichte sie mir mit den Worten: "Willst Du nicht die Zitter spielen?" Ich antwortete mit etwas heiserer Stimme: "Ach nein, lieber nicht", weil ich nämlich garnicht Zitter oder Harfe spielen konnte, und erwachte. (196 words)

Irgendwie hatte ich es versäumt, mich richtig vorzubereiten. Als die Glocke schlug, hatte ich nicht einmal ein Blatt mit einem Konzept. Ich beschloss also, den Vortrag ganz frei zu halten, rückte meine Hose zurecht und ging hinein. - Professor Rudolf Meyer war schon da, der den Vortrag eröffnen sollte, und die Zuhörer mit ihren erwartungsvollen Gesichtern. Ich konzentrierte mich nun ganz auf das Thema und kam zu den Fragen: Was ist Wirklichkeit? Was ist eine Nachricht? Was ist das politische System? - Langsam erwachte ich, ohne zu merken, oder zu realisieren, dass ja alles nur Traum gewesen war. Ich hielt in Gedanken den Vortrag, der Dialektik der Begriffe folgend und verschiedene Gedankenfäden durcheinander bindend. - Die Nachricht ist eine Wirklichkeit - eine entscheidende Wirklichkeit, eine situative Wirklichkeit, z.B. "Er hat eine schreckliche Nachricht bekommen", oder eine frohe Nachricht - z.B. Eu-angelion. - Nachricht als Botschaft ist eine entscheidende Wirklichkeit. Andererseits lebt die Nachricht von ihrem Wirklichkeitsgehalt. Der Nachrichtensprecher soll neutral sprechen, damit wir die Wirklichkeit der Nachricht in Ruhe prüfen und erwägen können. - Politische Wirklichkeit ist nicht nur Wirklichkeit von Fakten, sondern immer zugleich Wirklichkeit der Perspektiven - der Vorurteile, Beurteilungen. - Macht der Nachrichten etc. Ganz allmählich wurde ich so wach, dass mir erst richtig klar wurde, dass ich den Vortrag garnicht halten musste.

Ein Mädchen verhält sich erotisch herausfordernd. ich weiss, dass es nur Traum ist, und fasse ihr zwischen die nackten Beine. Es ist ein unverschlüsselt erotischer Traum, von dem ich ja weiss, dass er nur Traum ist. Ich denke, dass es deshalb all die Zuhörer, die in den Bankreihen sitzen, nicht sehen. Dabei scheint also vorausgesetzt, dass sie nicht Traum, sondern Wirklichkeit sind, nur das Mädchen ist geträumt. (77 words)

Ich hebe den Elefanten ein bisschen hoch und lasse ihn auf den Boden zurückfallen - aus erzieherischen Gründen. Es ist garnicht hoch - aber er streckt ostentativ alle Beine aus, so dass er flach und jämmerlich da liegt. (80 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2340 (1990-09-07 - Zürich)Träume von verschiedenartigen Wohnungen. Einmal wohnten wir im Oberstock eines kleinen Bahnhofes und konnte aus den Zimmerfenstern dem Bahngeleise entlang sehen, das geradlinig zu einem Tunnel lief, in dem es verschwand. Das Geleise führte genau unter uns durch den Bahnhof, so dass wir über dem Geleise wohnten. Später war ich bei dem Tunneleingang, der durch eine Holztür (wie durch eine Stuben- oder Haustür) verschlossen war. Ich machte mir Sorgen, dass der Zug diese Tür durchbrechen musste, zumal ich schon Geräusche wie von einer Lokomotive aus dem Tunnel hörte. Dann öffnete ich die Tür ganz weit, dass sie den Zug nicht behindern konnte, sah aber dabei im Tunnel einen Arbeiter mit irgend einer Maschine, die das Geräusch erzeugte. Der Arbeiter kam etwas erstaunt nach vorne zum Tunneleingang, und ich entfernte mich etwas betreten und tat, wie wenn nichts gewesen wäre. - In einer anderen Traumszene wohnten Emme und ich in der elterlichen Wohnung in Schwerin. Es war schon kühl, und ich dachte (von unsrem Besuch im letzten Sommer her), dass ja keine Heizung mehr im Haus wäre, fand aber doch etwas neuartigere niedrigere Heizkörper vor. - Wir waren in dem Zimmer, in dem ich zuletzt gewohnt hatte. Es war sehr vertraut. - In wieder einer anderen Traumszene kam ich ins Psychologische Institut, in meine Abteilung. Hier waren in dem Zimmer viele Menschen, die eine Art Fest feierten, wie bei einem Sommerfest. Zum Beispiel spielten sie in Badehosen Tischtennis. Ich geriet zwischen die Leute (es waren nicht Studenten, sondern Leute aus der Stadt), die mich ebenso als einen der ihren behandelten und natürlich nicht kannten. Ich überlegte, dass einer von meinen Leuten, vielleicht Dieter, das Fest arrangiert haben musste. (277 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2345 (1990-12-31 - Zürich)Ich musste irgendwie mit dem Zug nach Norden (wohl nach Wittmoldt). Zuvor hatte ich in einen roten Vorortzug einen Platz belegt mit meiner Geburtsurkunde und meiner Lesebrille. Nun wollte ich in dem Fernzug nach Norden einen Platz belegen - hielt aber die Belegung in dem Vorortzug noch aufrecht. - Ich ging auf den Bahnsteig und wartete, bis der Fernzug einfuhr. Er hielt da, wo ich stand, mit dem ersten Wagen. Ich überlegte noch, ob ich dort hinein sollte, weil viele den ersten Wagen aus Sicherheitsgründen meiden, tat es aber doch und ging hinein. Zuerst kam ein Gepäckabteil, dann die ersten Sitze. Hier belegte ich einen guten Sitz mit meiner Lederstrickjacke und meiner Baskenmütze. Die Lederstrickjacke hatte ich zu dem Zweck ausgezogen. - Nun musste ich aber zurück zu dem Vorortzug, um Lesebrille und Geburtsurkunde zu holen. Dazu stieg ich in einen dritten Zug, der gerade am Bahnsteig verschoben wurde, um schneller zu dem Vorortzug zu gelangen. Ich sah aber, dass dieser schon aus dem Bahnhof abgefahren war, so dass also Geburtsurkunde und Lesebrille weg waren. Zudem bemerkte ich, dass der vermeintlich rangierende Zug, in den ich gestiegen war, nicht mehr anhielt. Er fuhr auf gebogenen Geleisen durch ein Vorstadtgelände, und es wurde mir klar, dass er erst viel später im nächsten Ort anhalten würde. - Dann würde ich viel zu spät in den Ausgangsbahnhof zurückkommen, so dass auch der Fernzug mit der braunen Baskenmütze und der Lederstrickjacke fort sein würde. - Ich überschlug die Summe meiner Verluste und - inzwischen war ich offenbar doch auf der Reise nach Norden - bemerkte nun, dass ich vergessen hatte, meinen Mantel einzupacken, so dass ich im Norden, wo es noch kalt sein konnte, ohne Mantel war. Ich wachte mit Angstgefühlen auf. (288 words)

Ich antworte: "Den hab ich im Lauf der Zeit mir angeeignet. Ich bin Psychologe. Da erfährt man viele solche Begriffe." - Wir reichten uns im Vorübergehen die Hand und drücken sie kurz und kräftig im Zeichen des Einverständnisses. - Im Erwachen tut es mir leid, dass ich ihn nicht gefragt habe, warum der Begriff für ihn wichtig ist.

Belli arbeitete dort als Gärtnerin. Der Chef war ein Mann namens Martin Schneider, den einmal wohl Emme und einmal Bille mit falschem Vornamen benannten. Das Haus war sehr alt und lag am Wasser. Man konnte von dort baden. Um in den See einzusteigen, konnte man eine kleine Leiter benutzen., aber gerade dort war das Wasser sehr milchig weiss. Es muss wohl am Boden gelegen haben. Wir waren am Abend dort. Am Horizont sah man in der Dämmerung einen hutartig abgerundeten Berg, der sich im schwachen Abendrot abhob und hinter dem dunkle Wolken schnell dahinzogen. - Wir sahen dann auch alte Grundbuchakten in einem Regal, das fest eingebaut war und irgendwie zur Struktur des Hauses gehörte. Dabei auch solche von Schiffen. Ich sagte: " Ich wusste garnicht, dass Schiffe auch Immobilien sind, dabei sind es doch eigentlich Mobilien". Zuletzt gingen wir zusammen mit Herrn Schneider aus dem Haus heraus. - Jetzt war Bille meine Begleiterin.

Es war ein grosses Zelt mit fast geraden Wänden und oben leicht spitzem Dach. Drinnen standen Etagenbetten, in denen sie schliefen, und ihre Sachen. Ich kam dahin von aussen und versuchte, ein Fahrrad, das nicht richtig stehen wollte, neben der Ecke des Zeltes aufzustellen. Dabei klappte sich die vordere Zeltwand so auf, dass man die drei (erwachsenen) Kinder in den Betten schlafen sah. Bille und Tina kuckten irgendwie erstaunt. Belli war am tatkräftigsten, kam heraus und zog die Zeltwand wieder zu. (106 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2353 (1992-04-23 - Zürich)Le Corbusier beginnt, in ein Bild der Kuppel von Gran, das ich habe, Striche einzuzeichnen - wie ein Maler, der das Bild dadurch klarer machen will. Die Striche berühren die Kuppel selber nicht, sondern nur die Peripherie. Trotzdem bin ich empört, weil das Bild mir wichtig ist. Le Corbusier wundert sich darüber und sagt, er fände das kleinlich, ja fast neurotisch. Ich frage ihn, warum er denn die Striche gemacht hat. Er antwortet: "Das weiss ich nicht". - Man merkt, dass das stimmt und nicht etwa eine Ausrede ist. Es ist, wie wenn ein Maler, sozusagen getrieben, diese Striche zieht. - Le Corbusier, den ich im Traum persönlich gut kenne, hat einen Mantel an, der ganz dem gleicht, den ich in den letzten Tagen stets getragen habe: Es ist ein Dufflecoat, aus einem ungefütterten wolldeckenartigen Stoff (der mich übrigens an den capeartigen Lodenmantel erinnert, den ich 1943 in Roggow trug und in dem ich mir vorstellte, ich sei Dante - es war die Zeit, in der ich das erste mal die Göttliche Komödie las. - Dante trägt ein ähnliches kapuzenartiges Gewand auf allen Bildern). Der Traum ging dann so weiter, dass Le Corbusier, der jetzt zugleich die Züge des Photographen Kalan hatte (bei dem ich gestern war, weil er für mich Photos von einer Kopie von Le Corbusiers Photo der Kirche von Gran aus dem Jahre 1911 entwickelt und abzieht) -: dass er also mich in seinem Auto mitnahm. Er hielt irgendwo - es war mitten in der Nacht - an, um jemand, der dort wohnte, den er aber wohl nicht wecken konnte, etwas zu sagen, was ihm gerade eingefallen war, und fuhr dann abrupt weiter, wobei nicht alle Mitfahrer mitkamen, weil sie zum Teil noch draussen standen. Auch stand eine Wagentür des Autos - es war eine Art Volkswagen - noch offen. Le Corbusier fuhr nun wieder wild und sehr gefährlich mit dem Auto los. Vor uns ging auf der Strasse eine Frau mit einem Hund, der aber weit von ihr entfernt war, weil sie ihn an einer ausziehbaren Leine führte, die man in dem dämmrigen Licht kaum sah. Ich rief: "Vorsicht: Frau von links mit Hund: Leine kaum sichtbar!" In diesem Moment fuhr Le Corbusier, der sehr schnell fuhr, bereits zwischen Frau und Hund durch. Die Leine geriet auf das Autodach und lief über das Dach hinweg. Dann ging alles sehr schnell. es passierte nichts Gefährliches, weil die Leine, glaube ich, der Frau aus der Hand glitt. (409 words)

Dann fiel mir ein, dass ja er, mein Bruder, mit dem ich sprach, TW heisst, und korrigierte meine Rede. Aber der Name meines Sohnes fiel mir nicht ein. - Das war sehr peinlich. - Ich konnte mich nur auf den Namen meines anderen Sohnes - Rafael ?- besinnen. - So sagte ich einfach "Er" statt des Namens. TW schien das aber nicht all zu sehr zu wundern. - Dann wachte ich auf (im Traum) und erzählte Emme den Traum, konnte mich aber immer noch nicht auf den Namen meines Sohnes besinnen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2366 (1992-08-16 - Zürich)Träume von Schwierigkeiten, Komplikationen, mit Verkehrsmitteln. Mitten im Wald ist eine Bedarfshaltestelle für eine Schwebebahn. Ich hebe die Hand, als diese mit grosser Geschwindigkeit herankommt. Sie beginnt zu bremsen, doch scheint mir der Weg dafür viel zu kurz. Doch sie verlangsamt sich immer schneller und kommt wirklich über mir zum Stehen. Doch kommt sie durch die starke Bremsung ins Schwingen und verheddert sich an einem Pfahl. Aber nach kurzer Zeit löst sie sich wieder. Ich könnte nun einsteigen, aber sie ist viel zu hoch über mir und keine Leiter da. Doch sie lässt sich an einem Seil herab - eine sehr patente Einrichtung. - Es ist eine Kleinschwebebahn - gleichsam wie ein Auto, ein Taxi gebaut, in dem ausser dem Fahrer nur eine Frau sitzt. Er fragt sie, ob ich zusteigen dürfe. - Andere Szene: Ich will in einem Haus in einen Aufzug einsteigen, um herabzufahren. Aus irgendeinem Grund fährt er vorbei. Jetzt kommt aber ein Lastenaufzug (mit offener Tür) vorbei, dessen Schacht direkt daneben ist. Jemand - wohl zum Haus gehörend - steigt ein. Ein anderer Mann - wohl der Fahrer des Aufzugs - ist schon drin und sagt, ich könne auch mit fahren. - Aber der Aufzug, der eine Art zum Eingang hin offene Kiste ist, ist schon im Vorbeifahren (nach oben), so dass der Spielraum zum Eintreten immer kleiner wird, wie bei einem Paternoster. Ich kann mich nicht schnell genug entschliessen, verpasse den richtigen Moment und bleibe draussen. Der "Fahrer" sagt noch im Heraufschweben: es würde noch reichen. - Andere Szene. Ich habe an einer Endstation der Strassenbahn eine Mehrfahrtenkarte gekauft, die aus einem Bündel miteinander verbundener Billette besteht, die man einfach in den Entwerter schieben muss, so wie es früher in Zürich war. Ich bemerke erst später, dass der Aufdruck verschoben ist und nicht ganz drauf ist, und sie deshalb wahrscheinlich nicht richtig funktionieren werden.Ich beschliesse darum, an die Verkaufsstelle zurück zu gehen und sie zu tauschen. Als ich dort ankomme, ist dort niemand. Später ist eine Frau da (die Verkäuferin). Jetzt ist es eine ausweisartige Dauerkarte, die ich reklamiert habe und die sie in Ordnung gebracht hat. Es stehen verschiedene wartende Laute am Tresen - aber nicht in einer Schlange -, sodass ich nicht recht weiss, wann ich drankomme. Sie bemerkt mich und reicht mir zwei Ausweise herüber und sagt, ich solle meinen raussuchen. Beide haben aber andere Namen (Unterschriften) und Bilder. Ich sage es, und sie antwortet: "O, dann habe ich eben jemand das falsche gegeben." Ich rufe den noch am Ausgang stehenden Leuten zu: "Ist hier jemand, der einen falschen Ausweis hat?" Ein Mann ruft "Ja" und kommt heran. Es handelt sich aber um etwas anderes. - Die Frau sagt zu mir, sie habe sowieso überlegt, ob sie mir nicht eine Ermässigung verschaffen könne, weil meine Mutter so früh gestorben sei. Der zuständige Beamte habe das zuerst abgelehnt, aber dann habe sie einen Arzt gesprochen (wohl eine Art Betriebsarzt oder Vertrauensarzt), der gesagt habe, es ginge doch. Ich stehe da und überlege, dass das aber doch schon sehr lange her ist (meine Mutter ist 1939 gestorben, als ich 13 war) und dass die Leute vielleicht das nicht verstehen - eine Überlegung schon im Erwachen -, weil ich ja Professor bin und ein gutes Gehalt habe (542 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2370 (1992-08-16 - Zürich)Traum (6 Uhr morgens) Ich musste eilig irgendwohin. Gleichzeitig war aber eine englisch sprechende Frau da, wohl als Besuch in der Nachbarschaft -, die mit der Strassenbahn irgendwohin fahren wollte. Sie las die Nummernfolge vom Schild an der Haltestelle vor. Ich merkte, dass die Zahl nicht übereinstimmte mit der, die ich an einem anderen Schild dieser Linie las, und sagte: "Ich schreibe es auf." Dann hatte ich aber kein Schreibwerkzeug. Emme holte mir irgendwoher einige Bleistifte. Die Zeit verging, es wurde für mich immer eiliger. Nun sah ich an demselben Mast ein anderes Schild der selben Linie mit einer anderen Zahlenfolge. Die Zeit wurde immer knapper. Ich versuchte nun, heraus zu kriegen, worin der Unterschied bestand. Schliesslich merkte ich, dass der Anfang verschieden war. Auf dem einen Schild begann es mit einer 3 und einer etwa sechsstelligen Zahlenfolge, auf dem anderen mit den Ziffern 232 und dann aber der selben sechsstelligen Zahlenfolge. Ich merkte das, indem ich die Zahlen laut las. Welche war nun die gültige Zahl? Die Frau stand immer noch wartend in einiger Entfernung. Die Zeit lief dahin. Ich musste doch unbedingt selber losgehen. Beide Schilder wirkten alt und schon beschädigt. - Ich dachte, die grössere Anfangsziffer 232 wird wohl die richtige sein, weil solche Zahlen eher verlängert als verkürzt werden, und begann zu schreiben. Ich hatte aber keine Unterlage und musste auf dem gerundeten Holm schreiben. Jetzt versagte aber der erste Bleistift. Er war zu hart und gab keinen Strich. Jetzt wurde mir klar, dass die Zeit für mich auf keinen Fall mehr reichen würde, die Sache fortzusetzen. Ich drückte Emme das Bündel Bleistifte in die Hand und sagte: "Schreib Du. Ich muss weg", und wollte loslaufen, um zu meinem Termin zu kommen. Nun wurde mir klar, dass ich nun auch für mich selbst den Weg noch etwas überlegen musste, sodass ich nun zeitlich noch mehr in Bedrängnis kam, und ich erwachte. (315 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2374 (1992-08-31 - Zürich)Traf Markus und seine Freundin. Sie hatte schwarzes kurzgelocktes Haar und ein eher breites Gesicht und ein Grübchen auf dem Kinn. - Erwachen, Nachdenken über den Traum, erneutes Einschlafen, gleichsam Fortsetzung des Traums: Ich hatte deren Telephonnummer, die ich als Kontaktnummer vom Freund der Grauen Dame oder irgend jemand in einem ganz anderen Zusammenhang erhalten hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2375 (1992-09-01 - Zürich)Ich sah ein Tuch, das mir sehr lieb war- es hatte ein schönes Muster und ich hatte sogar meinen Namen darauf geschrieben, - über mir am Himmel schweben. Ein Anglist hatte es hinaufgestossen in die Sphäre, wo die Erdanziehungskraft es nicht mehr zurückfallen lässt, sondern es wie einen Satelliten schweben lässt. Dass es trotzdem so nah war, dass man alle Einzelheiten erkennen konnte, wunderte mich im Traum nicht. Ich war dem Anglisten gegenüber empört, dass er auf diese Weise etwas, was mir so lieb war, mir entzogen hatte ,und machte ihm deshalb Vorwürfe. Er sagte, es sei ein Raumschiff und der Kapitän habe es von ihm verlangt. Ich ärgerte mich über diese Ausflucht und sagte: Stellen Sie sich vor, James Joyce's Werke würden alle so an den Himmel geschossen und wären nicht mehr da. Nun war er bei dieser Vorstellung sehr bestürzt, denn er war ein James-Joyce-Spezialist. - Ich erinnerte mich auch daran, dass man bei der letzten Olympiade (zur Schlussfeier) den Chor, der das Lied an die Freude aus Beethovens neunter Symphonie sang, so an den Himmel befördert hatte, sodass die Sänger - gleichsam wie in Formation springende Fallschirmspringer, ehe sie den Schirm geöffnet haben, - am Himmel schwebten, aber eben auch, ohne herunter zu können. - Der Gedanke, dabei zu sein, war mir Angst erregend.- Andere Szene: Ich fuhr mit Emme im Trolleybus bergab (auf der Strecke von hier in die Stadt). Der Bus fuhr geräuschlos, wie mit abgestelltem Motor, und wurde immer schneller. Ich bekam den Verdacht, dass Motor und Bremsen versagt hätten, und so war es auch. An einer Kurve verliess er die Strasse und schoss weiter geradeaus in einen See und versank. Ich überlegte, dass ich die Glasscheibe über uns einschlagen müsse, damit wir vom Sog an die Wasseroberfläche hochgerissen würden. - (297 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2378 (1992-09-04 - Zürich)Gespräch mit einer Tänzerin über ihren bevorstehenden Auftritt. Dann tanzte sie. Danach sagte ich zu ihr, während wir noch unter den Leuten waren: Es ist doch eigentlich so, dass man dabei nur sich in Szene setzt, den Menschen. Dann fragte mich Inge Strauch, die auch da war, ob das bei mir auch so sei. Ich sagte Ja, und sie sagte: Ah, ist das bei Dir auch jetzt so, wobei deutlich war, dass sie es für sich schon lange so empfand. Das wunderte mich, weil sie doch oft sich in Bezug auf das Publikum eher scheu gab. Es war in der ganzen Situation klar, dass mit dem "Sich in Szene setzen" hier, ausgehend von dem Beispiel des Tanzes, jedes Auftreten überhaupt gemeint war, auch das Vorlesunghalten, und dass das nicht eigentlich egozentrisch gemeint war, sondern irgendwie archetypisch und auch leiblich, und eben stellvertretend für den Menschen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2379 (1992-09-04 - Zürich)Emme hatte ein schwarzes Samtkleid an mit einem kleinen weissen, fast nur angedeuteten Spitzenkragen, das ihr sehr gut stand. Ich sagte: Du siehst ganz süss aus. Auch ihre Pagenfrisur war sehr schön. - Erwachen. Ich wollte nun den Traum aufschreiben, schlief aber wieder ein und träumte den Vorgang des Aufschreibens nur: Ich stand auf, ging zum Computer und begann zu tippen, hatte aber mit dem neuen, noch ungewohnten Instrument noch Schwierigkeiten. Inzwischen war Emme aufgestanden und hatte im Briefkasten einen Brief gesehen, der eine wichtige Nachricht enthalte, die wohl die bevorstehende Fassadenrenovation des Hauses betraf.Sie wollte, dass ich den Brief hole, den sie offenbar noch nicht aus dem Kasten genommen hatte. Ich wollte aber zuerst den Traum vom Samtkleid zu Ende aufschreiben, um ihn nicht zu vergessen. Sie sprach aber immer wieder von dem Brief im Kasten, sodass ich in meiner Konzentration gestört wurde und Fehler machte. So kam ein grosser schwarzer Fleck auf das Blatt und ich beschloss, den Traum noch mal zu schreiben. Dabei geriet ich in alte Geleise und suchte ein Blatt Kohlepapier heraus.Schliesslich begann ich sogar, die alte mechanische Schreibmaschine aufzustellen, bis ich merkte, dass das ja garnicht nötig sei, und mich wieder an den Computer setzte. Endlich war die Niederschrift des Traums vom schwarzen Samtkleid fertig, und ich freute mich über den Erfolg. Nun erwachte ich wirklich und es wurde mir allmählich bewusst, dass ich den Traum überhaupt noch nicht aufgeschrieben hatte. So erhob ich mich und begann, dies hier zu schreiben. (247 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2380 (1992-09-06 - Zürich)Im Institut hing in dem Arbeitsraum, in dem jetzt auch der Computer steht, als Bild an der Wand ein lateinischer Text, ich glaube aus dem Credo, auf jeden Fall aus der Messe. Manchmal waren andere Sachen darübergehängt, die man gerade brauchte. Jetzt war dieser Spruch aus dem Rahmen genommen und entfernt. Ich fragte Christopher, warum das geschehen sei. Er sagte, sie hätten ihn abgehängt, weil es nur erlaubt sei, solche Texte an dem Tag aufzuhängen, an dem sie ran seien - gemeint war wohl soviel wie: zum Messtext dieses Tages gehörten. (91 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2381 (1992-09-10 - Zürich)Ich ging im Psychologischen Institut die Treppe herunter, nachdem ich mit jemand, ich glaube René Hirsig, gesprochen hatte. Jemand kam an mir vorbei, von dem ich glaubte, dass es mein Gesprächspartner von eben sei. Er grüsste mich freundlich, etwa: " Guten, Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?". Jetzt merkte ich, dass es Wolfgang Ehrich war, mein früherer Klassenkamerad aus Schwerin, der auch in der selben Strasse wie wir gewohnt hatte und den ich seitdem nicht mehr gesehen hatte. -. Ich bin dann aufgewacht, wohl nur im Traum, und wollte diesen Traum aufschreiben. Ich ging durch einen Garten, wo ich einen stillen laubenartigen Platz kannte, wo ich das ungestört tun wollte. Es ging aber eine Frau auf den Gartenwegen hinter mir her, die mich unbedingt in ein Gespräch verwickeln wollte. Dann hätte ich aber den Traum vergessen. Ich versuchte deshalb, sie abzuschütteln, was aber schwierig war. Es war in der Pause einer Vorlesung, sodass ich sagen konnte: Ich muss jetzt allein sein. Sie ging zwar darauf ein, folgte mir aber sehr dicht auf den Fersen. Ich schlug, glaube, ich noch einen Haken und erreichte schliesslich die Laube, um dort den Traum aufzuschreiben. In diesem Moment wachte ich nun richtig auf, merkte, dass der Traum noch nicht aufgeschrieben war , und musste mich nun tatsächlich sehr konzentrieren, um ihn zu behalten und dies hier zu schreiben.

Ich sagte:"Ich seh' Euch alle nur als Schattenrisse", und begrüsste sie einzeln. Es waren alles Freundinnen von Bille und den Kindern, die ich kannte und ebenfalls mit Küssen begrüsste. Dann wachte ich auf und merkte erst nach einer kurzen Besinnung, dass ich ja etwas geträumt hatte, ging zum Computer und schrieb dies auf.. (etwa drei Uhr nachts). (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2383 (1992-09-13 - Zürich)Wir kamen an und betraten, noch etwas ausser Atem, gemeinsam das Postamt. Was wir brachten, war etwas Wichtiges, eine Art Norm, etwa wie das Meter, aber es war etwas anderes, moderneres. Was es war, habe ich leider sofort nach dem Erwachen vergessen. Wir wollten es einer hochgestellten Persönlichkeit des Postwesens übergeben. Wir, oder Leute, mit denen wir zu tun hatten, hatten es, diese Art Norm , neu - oder richtig bestimmt und von einem anderen Ort, ich glaube Berlin oder ähnlich, hierher gebracht in einer Art "Lauf". Ich musste beim Eintreten noch eine etwas übereifrige Person, eine Frau wohl aus dem Bekanntenkreis von Tina oder ähnlich, zurückhalten, weil es wichtig war, dass ich die Leute, auf die es ankam, richtig vorstellen konnte. Ich fragte sie also, wer sie sei, aber sie sagte, dass ich sie nicht kenne und es wurde deutlich, dass sie nicht zu den Hauptpersonen gehörte, ich sie nicht kennen musste. Über diese Eintrittsszene hinaus habe ich alle anderen Einzelheiten der Traumszene vergessen, obwohl ich mich bemühte, sie in Erinnerung zu rufen. Ich bin dann wohl auch gleich erwacht (ein Uhr Nachts). (184 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2385 (1992-09-14 - Zürich)Ich sitze in einem Kaffee. Es ist ein munteres Leben um mich herum.Viele Jugendliche sind da. Alles ist sehr lebendig und man kann sich dazwischen gut entspannen. Um eine bestimmte Zeit gehen sie allmählich weg und eine grosse Zahl von - und Handelsleuten kommt herein. Sie reden lebhaft miteinander - etwa wie in einem englischen Pub. - Es ist eine freundliche, gelassene und zugleich etwas geschäftige Atmosphäre. Nach einiger Zeit stehe ich auf, um zu gehen, und schlendere durch den Raum. Ein Mann kommt herbei und tippt mich leicht von hinten an und sagt: Sie sind mir schon lange aufgefallen. Wir haben hier einen Klub - ich glaube, er hiess Messeklub. Wir treffen uns da und sind beisammen und essen auch. Wir haben natürlich koschere Sachen. - Er beginnt nun zu fragen, ob ich nicht dazu kommen wolle. Ich überlege, wie ich antworten soll, und dass ich ihm jetzt sagen muss, dass ich nicht Jude bin, wofür er mich doch offenbar ganz selbstverständlich angesehen hat. Es interessiert mich aber und ich überlege, in welcher Form ich vielleicht gelegentlich da hingehen könnte, falls er mich jetzt fragt, und werde langsam wach. Ich habe noch das Gefühl einer freundlichen Atmosphäre und der Situation dieses Kaffees, ehe mir ganz klar wird, dass ich ja geträumt habe. Ich glaube, ich habe auch in dem Traum schon in einem Gespräch zu jemandem, vielleicht zu Emme, gesagt, dass der Wechsel der Szene, wenn die Jugendlichen gehen und die Geschäftsleute kommen, ein erstaunliches Phänomen ist, eine interessante Erscheinung.

Ich stieg in eine Bahn und diese fuhr sehr lange, einmal auch durch einen langen Tunnel und durch mir unbekannte Stadtgegenden, und ich merkte, dass ich wohl in eine falsche Bahn gestiegen sein musste. Ich überlegte, dass ich irgendwo aussteigen müsse und es schwierig sein würde, die richtige Bahn zu finden, um zum Hotel zu kommen. - Andere Szene: Eine Zigeunerin will mich anbetteln und lässt sich einfach nicht vertreiben.Sie wirft sich zu Boden und umklammert meine Beine.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2389 (1992-09-20 - Zürich)Besuch bei Gilgen. Ich war mit anderen zu einem Empfang bei ihm eingeladen. Ich hatte ein grosses Gefäss aus leuchtend blauem Glas gekauft, um es ihm mitzubringen. - Es war ein schönes tiefes Blau, ähnlich wie bei den Fenstern, die in den älteren Strassenbahnen den Fahrer von den Fahrgästen trennen. Das Gefäss war so gross, dass ich es unter dem Arm halten musste. Als ich mit anderen vor der Tür seines Amtszimmers ankam - es war noch kurz vor der verabredeten Zeit -, kam er in einem weissen kapuzenartigen Mantel, einem Art Frisiermantel oder ähnlich, heraus. Er trug eine weisse Gesichtsmaske, wie man sie zum Erholen des Gesichts hat. Er kam mit tänzerischen Schritten heraus, war etwas erstaunt, uns schon zu sehen, sagte etwas wie: "Einen Augenblick bitte", nahm die Gesichtsmaske ab, unter der er in der Tat sehr erholt aussah, streifte den weissen Übermantel ab und war nun wieder offiziell gekleidet. Er schritt hinein, stellte sich auf und begann den Empfang. Da ich vornean stand, ging ich hinein und überreichte ihm das grosse Gefäss. Andere hatten andere Dinge mitgebracht, und diese Gastgeschenke wurden irgendwie neben ihm aufgebaut. Ich fand, dass er eigentlich etwas wenig auf das blaue Gefäss reagiert hatte, vielleicht, weil er es gewohnt war, als Regierungsrepräsentant Geschenke entgegen zu nehmen. - Jetzt fällt mir eine andere, vorhergehende Szene ein: Ich hatte viele Kartons, die etwa denen glichen, in die ich jetzt im Institut meine Betreuungsakten und Texte, die ich in den Vorlesungen ausgebe, und anderes verpackt habe, um die Sachen in den Uni-Tiefkeller bringen zu lassen. Diese Kartons hatte ich auf eine Art Rolltreppe gelegt, die gerade so breit war wie die Kartons, und die nach oben führte, wie auf das Oberdeck eines Schiffes oder Fahrzeuges. Jetzt kamen viele Leute, die dort hinauf mussten und einfach über die Kartons weggingen, die schon die ganze Treppe bis oben bedeckten, um heraufgerollt zu werden. Ich überlegte, den Leuten zu sagen, sie möchten die parallel verlaufende Treppe auf der anderen Seite benutzen, die frei war. (335 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2390 (1992-09-21 - Zürich)Ich kam in's Institut und schlug Corinne vor, die fünf superschweren Kartons zu entlasten, indem sie fünf leere danebenstellt und jeweils die Hälfte darin umpackt. Auf diese Weise wären sie beim Umzug leichter transportabel und würden auch nicht immer den Umzugsvorgang erschweren, weil man beim Verstauen auf sie Rücksicht nehmen müsse.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2392 (1992-09-26 - Zürich)Da war ein Archiv mit einer grossen Anzahl, zum Beispiel etwa 200 Exemplaren von jeder einzelnen Ausgabe einer Tageszeitung durch Jahre und Jahrzehnte hindurch. Es war die Frage, wie man sie anordnen, stapeln und verfügbar machen sollte. Allmählich wurde klar, dass das viel zu viel Platz brauchen würde, welche Anordnung man auch immer wählte. Man musste eine Auswahl weniger Exemplare, z.B. je vier, aufheben und den Rest vernichten. Diese kleine Menge wäre dann gut verfügbar und könnte z.B. auch mit dem Computer erfasst werden. Ausleiher müssten unter Umständen die Exemplare auch kopieren. Der Entschluss so viele Exemplare der grossen Serie zu vernichten, fiel aber schwer. Ich erwachte allmählich und dachte weiter über das Problem nach, bis mir allmählich klar wurde, dass es ja ein Traum gewesen war, sodass nun eher die Frage war, ob man aufstehen und ihn aufschreiben sollte und wie man ihn sich dafür merken konnte.

Es ist fest in einen Verband eingewickelt und schreit nicht, obwohl es auch Knochen gebrochen hat.

Diesen Zusammenhang kenne ich aber jetzt im Wachen nicht mehr, obwohl ich mir Geschichten ausdenken könnte, in deren Zusammenhang sie sinnvoll wären.

Da ich aber gar keine Erinnerung daran hatte und so etwas doch sicher nicht völlig vergessen hätte, bezweifelte ich, dass sie das schon einmal gesagt hätte. Auf dem Text der Platte waren einzelne Buchstaben anders als bei uns üblich geschrieben, so, glaube ich, das R als P, also wie im Russischen. (110 words)

Von ihr waren alle Gefahren ausgegangen. Ich gehörte ihretwegen auch, wie jemand sagte, zu den vom russischen Geheimdienst hoch bespitzelten Personen. - Es war ein sehr dramatischer Traum mit vielen geheimnisvollen Geschehnissen, die ich alle vergessen habe.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2403 (1992-10-07 - London)[Maree Hotel] Ich hatte etwa 200 Bilder, die von Leuten ein- und derselben Gruppe gemalt waren (Studenten oder Matrosen oder irgendetwas), die farbig und vielfältig eine Art Bilder der Seele waren. Sie waren teils gegenständlich, teils abstrakt und geheimnisvoll leuchtend. Ich hatte sie so ausgelegt, dass sie wie ein Album oder eine Decke ausfaltbar waren und so eine Art zauberhaften Bildteppich enthüllten. - Beim Zusammenfalten kamen aber die Bildflächen aufeinander zu liegen, und ich überlegte, ob die Farbe nicht leiden würde, und dachte mir andere Anordnungen aus. Dabei wandelte sich unbemerkt die Szene so, dass es nun alles Leichen, wohl in bemalten Särgen, waren, und offenbar waren alle diese Leute bei einem Anlass gemeinsam umgekommen. Ich musste nun diese alle irgendwie verstauen und hatte so eine sehr umfangreiche Menge. - Allmählich wurde mir klar, dass sie in ein Kühlhaus mussten. Dann waren es aber im weiteren Verlauf des Traumes doch wieder Bilder und ich wachte allmählich auf. - Ich hatte noch versucht, die Bilder stehend - gleichsam wie Karteikarten - anzuorden. Dabei kam ich aber einige male in die falsche Reihenfolge und machte mir Sorgen, dass sie nicht mehr identifizierbar sein würden. Emme half mir dabei, wandte aber ein anderes Prinzip an, sodass sie noch mehr durcheinander gerieten. (206 words)

Andere - sozusagen Usurpatoren - versuchten, die Aufführung der Oper an sich zu reissen. Ich liess die beiden legitimen Hauptpersonen auf meinen Schultern heimlich hereinreiten, indem ich auf dem Rücken liegend, mit den Beinen mich (Kopf voran) vorwärtsstossend, sie um ein Karree herum ( wie den Innenhof in Greenwich Palace oder in der Uni in Zürich, aber kleiner) gleichsam hereinreiten liess in grossen und schnellen Bewegungen. Es sollte dann ein Festmahl stattfinden. Ich wachte auf mit der Überlegung, dass ich keinen feierlichen Anzug hatte für diesen Zweck. Vorher spielte auch Fabian eine Rolle, der ebenfalls einmal in diesen Räumen gewohnt hatte und mit dem Helden, der Hauptfigur, darüber reden wollte. Der ging aber kaum darauf ein. Zwischendurch wurde auch einmal die Musik der Oper gespielt.

Ich war besorgt, dass er es gehört haben könne. Das schien aber nicht der Fall zu sein. Er hatte das Land vor seiner Wohnung umgraben oder sonst behandeln lassen, und als Stini ihn danach fragte, sagte er,dass er es einer bedürftigen Familie geben wollte. "Kümmern Sie, Frau Cord" - so nannte er sie - "sich um Ihre eigenen Sachen." Ich sagte vorsichtig zu ihm, dass das Land allen Wohnungseigentümern, rechtlich gesehen, gemeinsam gehöre.

Während früher nur die Kräftigsten im Struggel for Life das Ziel erreichten, hilft man heute möglichst allen. Auch ich versuche, eines, das immer wieder irgendwo hängen bleibt, immer wieder anzustossen, dass es weitergeht. (53 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2420 (1992-10-16 - London)[Maree Hotel] Ich halte ein Seminar in einer Klinik - über den Bezug von Traum und Welt. Eine Teilnehmerin erzählte ein Beispiel. - Ich sagte: "Worin liegt denn nun hier der Bezug von Traum und Welt?" Sie sagte: "Die ganze Familienrechtlerei". Wir lachten: sie meint die rechtlichen Beziehungen und die rechtliche Welt. - Ich sass auf dem Tisch und beugte mich so zur Seite, dass ich eigentlich jetzt seitlich und mit aufgstütztem Arm auf dem Tisch lag. - Ihr Mann, der auch Professor war, nahm eine ähnliche Haltung ein. Dann waren wir auf dem Weg zum Ausgang, Emme und ich. - Wir hatten uns irgendwie verlaufen und kamen in einen Hof. Er war voller merkwürdiger Patienten. Es war eine psychiatrische Klinik - eine geschlossene Abteilung. Ich fragte einen Mann nach dem Ausgang. Er sah recht merkwürdig aus und konnte kaum zusammenhängend reden. Schliesslich sagte er etwas wie "weit" und "28 mal". - Ich sagte: "Ja , ich sehe, es ist eine komplizierte Sache". Emme war inzwischen sehr nervös und wand sich zwischen den vielen Leuten hindurch, eine Tür suchend, die aus dem Hof wieder herausführte. - Dann wachte ich auf. (188 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2423 (1992-10-18 - Zürich)Ich hörte M (Emme) rufen "Dellev" aus der Ferne. Ich rief zurück: "Wo bist Du?". Man hörte ihre Stimme rufen aus der Ferne: "Toilette". Ich spürte, dass etwas nicht in Ordnung war, und rannte sofort los. Zuerst durch einen langen Gang, dann um einige Ecken. Es war wie bei einem der vielen verwickelten Gebäude in London, mit Gängen, die um die Ecke führen. Dann eine Art Vorplatz. Hier sah man Leute an einer grossen Glaswand stehen, an die sie ihre Köpfe drückten, um hinein zu sehen. Drinnen war Feuer. Man sah Flammen züngeln und mir war klar, dass M (Emme) irgendwo sein musste, wo sie den Ausweg nicht fand. Dann sah ich sie. Jemand hatte sie schon befreit und kümmerte sich um sie. Sie war wohlbehalten. Ich lief dorthin und erwachte. (131 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2424 (1992-10-19 - Zürich)Traum:Statt in den Fernzug nach Zürich sind wir irgendwo hinter Luzern eingestiegen in eine Art Bummelzug. Als wir es merken, ist der Zug schon angefahren. Erwachen - Vorher auf dem Bahnsteig las ich M (Emme) einen Brief vor, den ich geschrieben hatte. - Einzelne Zeilen waren schwer zu lesen. Ich wollte ihn nochmal abschreiben und hatte dabei Schwierigkeiten. Deshalb konnte ich mich nicht um die Suche nach den Abfahrtszeiten kümmern. So konnten wir nur noch im letzten Moment einsteigen. Emme war schon drin. Als ich einsteigen wollte, schloss sich die automatische Tür. Ich drückte sie wieder auf und zwängte mich hinein. - Noch vorher waren wir bereits in einen anderen falschen Zug eingestiegen, den wir aber erkannten. Es war ein sehr alter doppelstöckiger Triebwagen. Und Emme sagte: "Ich glaube, das ist ein Bummler", und wir stiegen wieder aus. Die ganze Situation war so, dass wir nicht dazu kamen, das Naheliegende zu tun und genau irgendwelche Angaben über den Zug zu lesen. Aber es waren auch nirgends richtige Schilder oder Fahrthinweise zu sehen. (172 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2425 (1992-10-20 - Zürich)Wir waren im Zirkus. Wir sahen das Geschehen gleichsam von oben, weil wir - ähnlich wie auf dem Rang im Theater - irgendwie in der Höhe sassen. Plötzlich öffnete sich gleichsam die gegenüberliegende Wand in ganzer Höhe und eine Schar von Tieren, vor allem Pferden, kam galoppierend durch die Luft auf uns zu - wie aus einer Wolkenwand hervorbrechend. Wir, d.h. Emme und ich, sassen direkt am Geschehen - wie in der ersten Reihe, aber hinter einer Wand aus Gitterstäben, sodass uns die Tiere mit ihren Hufen nicht treffen konnten, obwohl sie ab und zu damit die Gitterstäbe berührten. Es war ein überwältigender Eindruck, wie ein ungeheurer Wirbel und die Pferde flogen durch die Luft wie auf barocken Gemälden. Unter uns sassen andere Leute, darunter auch jemand, der eventuell offenbar selber auch in dem Zirkus mitspielen sollte. (137 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2426 (1992-10-21 - Zürich)Ich sollte an einem Konzert als Cellist teilnehmen. Ich kannte das Orchester, gehörte dazu, aber ich hatte schrecklich Lampenfieber, hatte das Gefühl, dass ich überhaupt nicht wisse, wie man aus dem Instrument je einen Ton herausbringen solle. Wir marschierten herein. Es war für so etwas wie Bachsche Musik. Es war eine Wiese auf die wir gingen, die sich nach einem Eingang zwischen Bäumen öffnete. Die Bläser gingen nach rechts und setzten sich am Rand der Wiese vor den Bäumen auf den Boden, die Geiger nach links. Ich folgte ihnen, obwohl ich nicht wusste, wo mein Platz sei, aber in dem Gefühl, dass ich dort am besten hinpasse. So kam ich neben eine Geigerin. Wir konnten uns aus einem Raum rechts von der Wiese kleine farbige Frottéehandtücher holen, um darauf auf dem Gras zu sitzen ( Wie in einem Schwimmfreibad). Die Geigerin neben mir sagte, als ich dazu losging, ich solle unbedingt wieder neben sie kommen, da sie schreckliches Lampenfieber hätte. Ich war sehr getröstet, dass es offenbar anderen auch so ginge und dass sie zu mir so Vertrauen hatte, wo ich mich doch allen unterlegen fühlte. Der Dirigent, der beiden Instrumentengruppen gegenüber auf der Wiese stand, sagte, dass wir jetzt einen Augenblick Pause hätten bis soundsoviel Uhr und ich erwachte. -Vorher schon andere Szene: Ich ging auf dem Dachboden der ETH, um einen Raum zu suchen, oder zu irgend einem bestimmten Anlass zu kommen. Es war schon ein recht altes Gebäude. Die Balken hatten sich schon etwas gesenkt, und es wirkte zugleich naturhaft. Es war eine schöne Raumfolge in verschiedenen Winkeln, die gleichsam die Struktur des Gebäudes abbildeten, in dem es schwer war, sich zurecht zu finden. Das Dach wirkte leicht gewölbt oder gebrochen, eigentlich wie das Dachinnere eines Gebäude aus den Zehner-Jahren, und glich im Baustil so auch der Uni. Aus dieser Wegszene auf dem Dachboden ist dann im Szenenwechsel wohl der Weg auf die Wiese zu dem Konzert geworden. (321 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2427 (1992-10-22 - Zürich)Ich musste irgendwo in einer Stadt am See, wie Luzern, eine Vorlesung oder ein Seminar halten, wohl in einer Klinik. Wir fuhren mit dem Auto da hin. M (Emme) sass am Steuer. Aber es passierten verschiedene Dinge, die zu Verspätungen führten, so dass die Zeit bis zum Anfang kürzer wurde.Emme musste irgendwo noch etwas holen oder abgeben und stieg aus und ging ein Stück vom Auto weg. Ich sah etwas danach auf die Uhr - ich hatte eine Armbandur - und sah dass es schon ganz kurz vor Beginn war. Emme rief mir etwas zu, während sie mit jemand sprach. Da, wo sie etwas holen oder abgeben wollte, schien niemand zu sein oder aufzumachen. Ich rief, dass es schon sehr spät sei. Sie verstand mich nicht. Ich ging aus dem Auto. Der Ort, wo sie stand ,war über mir am Berghang. Ich versuchte, näher zu kommen, damit sie mich besser hören konnte, kam aber nur ganz mühsam und schliesslich den Hang kriechend voran und hinauf - wie gelähmt. Ich rief nochmal mit grosser Mühe "Es ist schon ganz spät", wobei meine Stimme versagte und nur sehr leise und knarrig war. Aber jetzt verstand sie es und rief Oje , zu spät! Ich komme. Dann war sie im Auto und versucht, mich zu beruhigen und zu sagen, dass wir es noch schaffen. Ich sah wieder auf die Uhr. Inzwischen war es 7 Minuten nach vol, und Viertel nach sollte das Seminar beginnen. Ich sagte,das schaffen wir nie und sah in meiner Vorstellung die wartenden Leute in einem grossen Raum und den Gastgeber, offenbar in einem weissen Arztkittel wie Nager. -und sagte: "Die Leute werden wieder weggehen." Dann wachte seufzend mit einem Jammerton auf und Emme - jetzt wirklich und für mich im Wachen - sagte - selber noch im Schlaf - :"Seufzt der ?" (im Sinne von: Warum seufzt der?). - Ich::Träume, Zuspätkommenträume. - Sie: "Armer Dellev. Du kommst nicht zu spät. (Fortsetzung siehe ihre Schlafrede) (325 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2429 (1992-10-24 - Zürich)Ich war in Roggow. Es war aber einiges anders, als es in Wirklichkeit in Roggow war, teils ähnlich wie in Wittmoldt nach dem Kriege, wo sehr viele junge Leute waren. Wir waren irgendwie umhergefahren oder gegangen. Es war am Tag meiner Abreise. Ich suchte meinen Koffer. Er war in irgendeinem Auto gewesen, in dem wir umhergefahren waren. Ich konnte ihn aber nicht finden. Ich ging im Freien vor oder hinter dem Haus umher in der Suche danach. Dann standen da unzählige Koffer, offenbar von einer Reisegesellschaft. Da konnte er aber nicht dazwischen sein. Jemand reichte mir meine Kollegmappe. Nun hatte ich wenigstens diese, aber nicht den Koffer und ein anderes Gefäss, das ich auch noch suchte. Ein junger Mann drückte mir einen alten kleinen Schwamm in die Hand. Ich sagte: "Danke, den kann ich leider nicht brauchen". Er sagte : "Ich auch nicht". Ich warf den Schwamm weg und näherte mich dem Haus. Nun sah ich, dass im Saal schon alle an der grossen Tafel zum Abendessen sassen. Ich überlegte, ob ich direkt hinein gehen sollte und sagen: "Ich bitte vielmals um Entschuldigung. Ich habe garnicht gemerkt, dass es schon so spät ist". Aber ich hatte ja meine Kollegmappe noch unter dem Arm. Ich konnte durch einen Raum neben den Esssaal ins Haus gehen, meine Kollegmappe in mein Zimmer bringen und dann zum Essen runter kommen. Aber dann würde es noch später werden. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwachnte ich. (238 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2430 (1992-10-25 - Zürich)Das hätte ihn rote Eier der Matrosen gekostet. Dieser Satz kam in meinem Traum vor. Es war ein Gespräch, das zwei Kollegen neben mir führten und dem ich noch halb schläfrig zuhörte. Dabei taten sie irgendetwas wie Kreuzworträtsellösen oder Ähnliches. Auf jeden Fall hatten sie ein schachbrettartiges Muster vor sich. Ich sagte:"Was Ihr jetzt geredet habt, klang wie Chinesisch." Sie waren zunächst erstaunt, rekonstruierten dann aber einzelne Sätze, die sie gesagt hatten, und sagten:"Ja, das klingt wirklich wie Chinesisch." Es war eine entspannte, kameradschaftliche Atmosphäre. - Vorher waren irgendwelche räumlichen Verhältnisse Gegenstand des Traums. Es ging Treppen hoch im Dachstockbereich eines alten Hauses, wo ein kleiner Raum war, in dem ich früher gewohnt hatte, ähnlich wie der "Käfig" - eine kleine zeltartige Mansarde, in der ich in Freiburg gewohnt hatte. - Auch hier war die Atmosphäre sehr geborgen, durchsetzt mit dem Aufkommen freundlicher alter Erinnerungen, oder wie das Wiedegewinnen einer alten Geborgenheit. Auch das Erforschen und Erleben einer alten verwickelten Dacharchitektur, aus der Zeit um die Jahrhundertwende, von innen spielte dabei eine Rolle. Weitere Einzelheiten habe ich vergessen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2431 (1992-10-26 - Zürich)Emme machte ein Bild auf ein Hemdchen für Tobias in den Farben eines Farbpyramidentests, den er gemacht hatte, viel Gelb und viel Weiss, den wir den "Kindskopf" nannten. Sie sagte: "Ich mach de Kindskopf auf das Libli". Andere Szene: Wir wollten eine Reise oder Ausflug mit SSR machen. Wir gingen auf einem langen umständlichen Weg zu einem Treffpunkt in der Stadt, der als Ausgangspunkt angegeben war. Eine bestimmte Hausnummer in einer Strasse. Plötzlich blieb Emme im Gehen stehen,.Ich wunderte mich. Sie sagte: "Wir sind da". Da sah ich: es war die Hausnummer. Ein Radfahrer mit einem Schild, das farbig war in leuchtenden Farbstreifen, kam daher und fuhr direkt auf uns zu. SSR und das Reiseziel stand darauf. Er kam also, um den Treffpunkt zu bezeichnen. Wir waren offenbar die ersten. Als ich sagte: "Wir sind offenbar die ersten", fiel mir ein: Wir hatten die Karten vergessen. Sie lagen zu Hause in meiner Schublade. Ich sagte:"Wie sollen wir die jetzt kriegen", begann fieberhaft zu überlegen, weil die Zeit dazu eigentlich nicht reichen konnte, und erwachte. (174 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2432 (1992-10-27 - Zürich)Ein Fakultätstreffen. Viele Leute standen redend in einem Raum herum. Ich sprach mit Brigitte Boothe. Ernst Leisi kam herein. Er hatte einen langen feierlichen schwarzen Mantel an mit einem Kragen aus Samt oder Pelz, den er am Kopf hochgezogen hatte. Offenbar war es draussen, von wo er reinkam kalt. Er war uns abgewendet. Man sah ihn von hinten und erkannte ihn so nur an Gestalt und Bewegung. Er wirkte klein an Statur zwischen anderen ziemlich langen Leuten. Ich wollte ihn mit Brigitte Boothe bekannt machen. In diesem Moment lenkte mich jemand anders ab, der mich ansprach. Ich reagierte darauf, versuchte aber gleichzeitig Leisi und Brigitte im Auge zu behalten, um sie miteinander bekannt zu machen. In diesem Augenblick näherte sich Brigitte Boothe Leisi von hinten, zog ihn am Haarschopf und sprach ihn von hinten auf Englisch an. Das wirkte erstaunlich und zugleich vertraulich, aber auch selbstsicher und ich wunderte mich darüber und wachte allmählich auf. (155 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2433 (1992-10-27 - Zürich)Traum (Zweiter Traum): Sile war da. Wir bekuckten zusammen ein Aufstehbilderbuch. Wir knieten dabei vor einem Tisch. Sile ging mit dem Kopf fast in das Bilderbuch herein. Ich dachte: Komisch, sie ist doch nicht kurzsichtig. Dann wurde mir klar: Es waren lauter kleine Räume mit Gestalten in dem Aufstehbuch, in die sie auf diese Weise richtig hineinkucken konnte. Sie drückte sich dabei an mich und meine Hand berührte die nackte Haut ihrer Oberschenkel, die sich weich und elastisch anfühlten. So entstand eine sehr erotische Atmosphäre. Eine Frau sah ich wartend auf der anderen Seite des Tisches stehen. Sie sagte, dass sie auf Emme warte. Sie sagte:"Ich habe sie lange gekannt". Offenbar war sie eine Bekannte von früher. Ich kannte sie aber nicht. Aus dieser Situation erwachte ich. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2434 (1992-10-29 - Zürich)Ich bekam eine Antwort von der Erziehungsdirektion auf ein Gesuch, das ich gestellt hatte für Stellen, die ich brauchte, eine Art Hilfskraftstellen. In dem Begleitbrief stand, dass ein Teil der Stellen für Entwicklungsarbeiten in Afrika sei, ein anderer für hier. Das ganze war ein Paket mit vielen Einzelheiten, das ich von der Erziehungsdirektion erhielt, viele einzelne Schriftstücke und anderes, die umständlich in Papierservietten verpackt waren, die irgendwie gefaltet und zugeklebt waren. Ich stellte mir vor, wie eine Sekretärin dies alles umständlich verpackt hatte, sagte aber dann, dass es vielleicht nur deshalb so umständlich verpackt sei, weil diese Art von Sendung sonst bei ihnen nicht vorkommt und sie deshalb improvisieren mussten. Im Zusammenhang der Papiere die ich in die Hand bekam, war auch ein Exemplar meiner Doktorarbeit, in dem aber viele Sätze nicht richtig lesbar waren, weil die Schreibmaschinenschrift da nicht richtig durchgeschlagen hatte. Ich erinnerte mich, wie Emme die Arbeit für mich auf Gelbes Bibeldünndruckpapier geschrieben hatte, Das war auch bei vielen Durchschlägen noch lesbar. Dies aber war weisses und dickeres Papier. Während ich auspackte, sass Emme neben mir und es war noch ein älterer Mann da, etwa wie Onkele, bei dem ich mich für irgendetwas bedanken, oder etwas mit ihm besprechen musste. Ich musste aber zuerst herausbekommen, wieviel Stellen ich genehmigt bekommen hatte, weil das so wichtig war. Und dieser Prozess ging so langsam, weil die Schriftstücke so umständlich verpackt waren, und ich die schönen alten Papierservietten, die so liebevoll gefaltet und zugeklebt waren, beim Aufmachen nicht beschädigen wollte. In einer anderen Szene des Traums war ich in der Stube eines jungen Mannes, der in einem Keller oder Souterain-Zimmer wohnte. Um rauszukommen musste man eine wendeltreppenartig enge Kellertreppe hochklettern und in deren oberster Kurve eine Tür nach aussen an die man nur sehr mühsam herankam, öffnen, wobei man die Tür in dem engen gewundenen Raum der Treppe auf sich zu ziehen und deshalb etwas zurückweichen musste. Ich sagte etwas Witziges zu dem jungen Mann darüber, der hinter mir auf der Treppe war. Es waren auch noch andere Leute in dem eigenartigen Treppengehäuse. In einer anderen Szene des Hauses, hatte ich einen alten Anzug aus einem trainigsanzugartigen Stoff, der wieder fitt gemacht werden sollte, was Emme tun wollte. Es zeigte sich, dass er aus einem Stück gemacht war wie ein Overall, in den man als ganzes hineinschlüpfen musste, und ich sagte zu Emme, dass bestimmte Nähte, die sie öffnen wollte, eigentlich nicht Nähte sondern Abnäher waren, die man garnicht öffnen konnte. Man musste den Anzug so nehmen, wie er war. Darüber war sie froh, weil es die Arbeit des Änderns ersparte..Er gefiel mir aber auch in seiner Form gut, die eine altmodische aber chice Eleganz hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2436 (1992-10-30 - Zürich)Wir hatten eine neue Wohnung gemietet gehabt, weil die alte entweder zu klein oder zu unsicher oder sonst etwas war. Ich ging dort hin, um sie noch einmal anzusehen, nachdem wir schon einmal mit Bille dort gewesen waren. Ich ging das Treppenhaus hoch. Irgendwo verzweigten sich die Treppen. Ich wählte die , von der ich glaubte zu erinnern, dass es die richtige sei. Ich fand aber die Wohnung nicht. An den Eingängen, die ich fand, standen andere Namen. Ich erinnerte mich, wie wir mit Bille in der Wohnung gewesen waren und irgendwo zum Fenster hinaus geschaut hatten, auf die Strasse. Ich stieg weiter die Treppe hoch, weil ich nicht mehr genau wusste, in welcher Etage es war. Schliesslich kam ich oben aus einer Tür wieder ins Freie. Auch das erinnerte ich. Das Haus war irgendwie in einer geheimnisvollen Weise so gebaut, dass das möglich war, wie wenn es in einen Berg hinein, oder an einen Berg so gebaut war, dass man nach vielen Treppen und Etagen auch oben wieder auf den Erdboden gelangen konnte. Ich ging nun dort ein Stück die Strasse entlang. Kinder spielten da. Zwei etwas ältere warfen ein kleines Kind im hohen Bogen weit durch die Luft. Es fiel danach zur Erde auf einem kleinen Spielplatz. Trotz des hohen Falles war ihm aber nichts passiert. Vielleicht war es in einen Sandkasten gefallen. Ich versuchte, von oben erneut in das Haus zu gelangen. Eine steile Treppe führte von diesem Obereingang hinab. Ein jugendlicher Motorradfahrer, offenbar ein Bewohner des Hauses fuhr mit dem Motorrad einfach zur Tür hinein und die ganz steile relativ lange Treppe hinab. Er stürzte sich regelrecht mit dem Motorrad dort herab, kam heil dort an und fuhr mit einer schnellen Wendung auf den Gang. Offenbar war er das gewohnt und hatte es sehr geübt. Ich stieg auch wieder hinab und suchte wieder nach der Wohnung. Aus einer Tür kamen mir lauter junge Leute entgegen, die ich irgendwie kannte. Sie wohnten dort wohl in einer Pension. Sie waren offenbar alle Juden. Sie grüssten mich und liefen nacheinander weiter, hatten offenbar den selben Termin. Eine Frau, die aus der Tür kam fragte mich nach irgendeinem Ereignis in Deutschland, das ich aber nicht kannte und das anscheinend eine neuerliche antisemitische Ausschreitung dort darstellte. Ich ging inzwischen weiter wieder irgend eine Treppe hoch auf der Suche nach der neuen Wohnung. Dann war ich in einer anderen Traumszene wieder in unsere richtige Wohnung gelangt. Ich war ganz entsetzt bei dem Gedanken, dass wir dort hinaus zu müssen geglaubt hatten. Es war doch eine so schöne Wohnung und ausserdem gehörte sie uns ja als Eigentumswohnung. Aber ich sagte mir, dass man ja die neue wieder kündigen könne, wenn es auch die Monate bis zum Termin, der sich aus der Kündigungsfrist ergeben würde, Miete kosten würde. Hauptsache, wir behielten die alte Wohnung. Ich lag in meinem Bett. Emme war in der Klinik wohl wegen einer Operation. Ich besuchte sie jeden Tag dort und wollte wieder hingehen. Da fiel mir ein, dass ich ja heute morgen den ganzen Vormittag prüfen müsse in der Uni. Ich musste also sie von dort aus anrufen und überhaupt musste ich schnell aufstehen. Ich versuchte , die Lampe neben meinem Bett anzuknipsen, aber sie ging nicht,wenn ich den Knopf drückte. Ich versuchte also, die Leuchtziffern der Uhr zu sehen. Nun wachte ich auf und sah dass es viertel vor Fünf war. Auf Fünf Uhr habe ich den Wecker gestellt. Ich war froh, dass alles nur Traum war, Emme neben mir im Bett und unsere Wohnung ganz unangefochten. (589 words)

Ich wollte Tobias zu ihm herüber reichen und nannte dabei den Namen Szilasi in seiner schwebenden zweigipfligen ungarischen Betonung, den Tobias schon von früher her kannte. Es ging darum, den schon recht schweren Tobias auf der Höhe der brüstungartigen Lehne an Szilasi zu übergeben, der seine Hände von unten hochreckte, wobei Tobias ziemlich zappelte.

Ich hatte mir ein bestimmtes Kopfkissen besorgt, das keine Kunststofffüllung, sondern eine Naturfüllung hatte. Dies war in Gefahr, wieder zu verschwinden. Jemand behauptete, ein Salatetikett hätte sich darin verklemmt, und legte es in einen Nebenraum. Ich glaubte das nicht, hielt das Etikett für ein zum Kissen gehöriges, und wollte es wieder holen. Einmal warf ich das Kissen in die Höhe, wohl aus Fittnesgründen. Beim Herabfallen geriet es zwischen die Wand und eine Wandverkleidung aus weissem Stoff. Ich musste nun durch einen Nebenraum hindurch, um es dort wieder hinausziehen zu können. Jemand, der wohlmeinend war, sagte, ich solle dort lieber nicht hineingehen, weil es sonst heissen würde:"Der Uslar geht überall hin, wo er nicht soll". Ich ging deshalb ganz schnell hindurch und es gelang mir, das Kissen wieder hinaus zu ziehen, ehe jemand kam. (143 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2452 (1992-11-15 - Zürich)Das erste Wort von Tobias: Er war beim Essen, hatte ein rundes Brötchen. Ich sass ihm gegenüber in der Küche. Er drehte das Brötchen um, sah die unbestrichene Rückseite und sagte nun ein sehr originelles Wort, um diese Veränderung auszudrücken. Aber gerade dieses Wort hatte ich vergessen, als ich später jemand dieses erste Wort von Tobias berichten wollte. Emme stand daneben und sagte, das Wort sei das Wort "leer" gewesen, aber das war es nicht, es war nur ein anderes Wort, das den Umstand, dass die Rückseite des Brötchens unbestrichen, also leer war , ausdrückte. Nun konnte ich das Wort in der Erinnerung garnicht mehr finden. Aber die Sache war noch komplizierter, denn nun wurde mir klar, dass Tobias das Wort garnicht wirklich gesagt hatte, sondern ich war, ihm beim Essen gegenüber sitzend, nur kurz eingenickt und hatte dieses sein erstes Wort nur geträumt. Darüber war der Gesprächspartner, dem ich diese Geschichte vom ersten Wort von Tobias gerade erzählte, auch enttäuscht. Es ist also eine komplizierte Ineinander-schachtelung von Traum im Traum und Traumerzählung. Dann war da noch eine andere Traumszene, ich weiss nicht genau ob vorher oder hinterher, wo es um das Aufschreiben eines Traums im Computer ging. Man konnte bestimmte Leerstellen im Traumtext räumlich ausdrücken, indem man einen Teil des Bildschirms aussparte. Dann verschob sich aber alles hinterher und der Text verschob sich, oder es kam, glaube ich, anderer Text zum Vorschein. Dann erzählte ich das Inge Strauch, die ich in der Universität traf, als ich mit Corinne in die obere Etage über der Aula-Etage ging, wo der Zugang zu den Aulaemporen ist. Ich erklärte ihr, dass wir dahingingen, um vor der Vorlesung zu kontrollieren, ob die Türen zu den Emporen auch aufgeschlossen seien. Dann wachte ich auf und allmählich wurde mir klar, dass dies alles nur Traum sei und ich es nun auf dem Computer wirklich aufschreiben musste. (310 words)

Es sind zwei längliche parallel nebeneinander liegende Zimmer. Verena Kast hat das linke, sie bekommt das rechte. Jedes hat von aussen einen eigenen Eingang. Vorne quer liegt eine gemeinsame Küche davor, hinten noch ein anderer quer liegender Raum, der wohl Verena Kast gehört. Mit dieser rede ich darüber, als wir uns treffen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2454 (1992-11-16 - Zürich)Ich war in einer Versammlung von lauter Freudianern, lauter Psychotherapeuten. Ich hatte dort irgendeine Verbandsfunktion, war der einzige Nichtpsychotherapeut dort. Zu Besuch war ein jungianisches Psychotherapeuten-Ehepaar mit ihrem Sohn. Ich überlegte, ob ich zur Begrüssung sagen sollte, dass der Sohn der Gäste und ich ja die einzigen Nicht-Psychotherapeuten hier seien, tat es aber nicht. Dann überlegte ich mir eine sachliche Frage, die man den Gästen stellen könnte. Ich wollte sie fragen, welche Rolle das, was Freud Verdichtung genannt hat, bei Jung spielt, denn es ist ja ein Phänomen. Was also Jung damit anfängt. Dann erwachte ich. (96 words)

Da fiel mir ein, dass ich ja in wenigen Monaten pensioniert werde und es mir leisten könne, die Bücher jetzt einfach zurückzugeben. Das war sehr erleichternd. - Vorher oder hinterher noch andere Szenen, wo es um verwickelte Räumlichkeiten ging, in denen man zum Teil auch irgendwie eingesperrt war und denen man auf Schleichwegen entrinnen musste.

So sind zum Beispiel alle Bäder in völlig runden Räumen an einer Ecke des Hauses angebaut. An einer anderen Stelle muss man über eine Art Schwelle hochkriechen und befindet sich dann in einem alten Teil des Hauses, der ganz unerwartet Tonnengewölbe hat. An einigen Stellen sieht man dort an den Fugen der Wand den Himmel durchscheinen, weil es sehr alte Mauern sind, in denen sich dort Zwischenräume gebildet haben.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2460 (1992-11-21 - Zürich)Tobias hatte den ersten Turm gebaut. Er war bei uns zu Besuch. Tina hatte ihn gebracht und sass noch mit ihm und uns am Tisch. Plötzlich entdeckten wir es: einen kleinen Turm aus einem Glas oder anderem zylindrischen Gefäss und einem daraufgestellten ebenfalls zylindrischen Pillendöschen, dessen Deckel aus Glas wie ein geschliffener farbiger Edelstein gebildet ist. Das Döschen steht schon lange auf unserer Fensterbank neben der Zuckerdose. Jemand von uns entdeckte den Turm und rief: "Er hat einen Turm gebaut. Der erste Turm!". Ich lief, um die Kamera zu holen, um ihn zu photographieren. Während ich sie fertig machte, versuchte er, nach dem Turm zu langen und ihn wieder einzureissen. Tina und ich versuchten, seine Hand zurückzuhalten, bis ich abgeknipst hatte, was ihn natürlich besonders anreizte, nach dem Turm zu greifen. Erwachen. (132 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2462 (1992-11-22 - Zürich)Unter den Karteikarten, auf denen die bei mir gemachten Arbeiten und Referate der Studenten eingetragen sind, war auch eine mit meinen eigenen Arbeiten. Diese nun hatte Inge Strauch in der Hand und studierte sie. Sie interssierte sich dabei auch für die Gliederung der Karte, was alles draufstand, zum Beispiel Adresse und Telephonnummer, und wie die Eintragungen angeordnet waren. Dabei fand sie, dass man bestimmte Striche, mit denen die Felder für diese Eintragungen angegeben waren, noch geschickter ziehen könne. Sie versuchte deshalb, mit einem Tintenzeichenzirkel, den sie in der Hand hatte, diese Striche zu verbessern und miteinander zu verbinden. Das gelang ihr aber nicht, die Striche wurden schief und zitterig und es gab Tintenkleckse. Ich überlegte, hinter ihr stehend, dass ich das hinterher mit Tippex wieder wegmachen müsse und dass es nun bei aller Höflichkeit doch nötig sei, sie zu stoppen. Bei der Überlegung, wie ich das zu ihr sagen sollte, wachte ich auf. (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2463 (1992-11-23 - Zürich)Ich war in einer ziemlich trockenen Landschaft, in der viele kleine Tiere waren, Mäuse und andere. Jemand hatte gesagt, wenn ich auf den Boden aufstampfen würde, würden sie mir zu einem Platz folgen, wo es Wasser und Nahrung für sie gäbe. Ich tat das und viele kleine Mäuse und andere Tiere kamen sofort aus ihren Spalten. Eines, das ein kräftiges Gebiss hatte und etwas grösser war, sprang sofort in die Tasche meines Bademantels, andere klammerten sich daran fest oder folgten mir so. Ich ging nun los und merkte sehr bald, dass in der grubenartigen, mit vereinzelten Büschen und kleinen Bäumen bestandenen Gegend nirgend Wasser war. An einem böschungsartigen Rand dieser Landschaft schlug ich mit dem Fuss und einem Instrument auf den Boden, weil jemand gesagt hatte, dass dann Wasser käme. Aber es geschah nichts und die Tiere waren sehr erwartungsvoll. Ein vorbeikommender Mann, der sich offenbar auskannte, bestätigte, das dort in weniger trockenen Zeiten Wasser käme. Ich versuchte es noch einmal an einer Stelle, an der ein ganz leises Rauschen hörbar schien, mit kräftigen Schlägen mit irgend einem Instrument. Plötzlich quoll etwas Wasser hervor, das langsam mehr wurde und nun schon einen kleinen Tümpel bildete. Aber ich hatte nichts zum Schöpfen. So schöpfte ich Wasser mit der hohlen Hand und begann es zuerst dem Tier in meiner Manteltasche, dann den anderen, die an mir hingen, über die Schnauze zu giessen. Der Mann sagte, ich müsse es vorsichtig tun und nicht zu viel auf einmal über sie giessen - offenbar, weil ihnen das nach langem Durst schaden würde. Ich tat weiter so, dachte dabei, dass sie zwar nur Wasser und noch keine Nahrung bekämen, die sich hier erst allmählich bilden würde, und erwachte langsam. (283 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2464 (1992-11-25 - Zürich)Andri war da und wir hüteten ihn. Nach einiger Zeit schlief er auf dem Balkon genau an der Trennwand zum Nachbarbalkon ein auf einem Kissen, das dort lag. Wir überlegten, ob es ihm dort ziehen könne, weil die lichtdurchlässige schmale Trennwand am Boden einen Spalt hat, liessen ihn aber schlafen. Nun begann auf der anderen Seite der Trennwand jemand , wohl Cecile, die Blumen zu giessen, die dort auf der Seite der Nachbarn an der Trennwand wachsen. Es gab ein lautes platterndes gleichmässiges Geräusch davon - offenbar wurden die Pflanzen mit einer Giesskanne mit Brause gegossen - und wir fürchteten, Andri könne davon geweckt werden. Wir hatten beschlossen, ihn schlafen zu lassen Ich hatte mit Emme darüber gesprochen. Nun begann ich zu rufen: Hallo - auf englisch ausgesprochen - und wollte Cecile bitten, mit dem Giessen aufzuhören, überlegte noch, wie ich auf englisch sagen müsse, dass ein Kind dort schläft. Aber das Giessgeräusch hörte nicht auf. Wir hatten auch Sorge, dass das Kind nass werden könne. Allmählich begann ich immer lauter zu rufen, ohne dass es eine Wirkung hatte. Ich streckte nun die Hand um die Trennwand und winkte. Auch das nützte nichts. Schliesslich klopfte ich erst sanft, dann stärker an die Trennwand, ohne dass es eine Wirkung hatte. Wir kamen nun zu dem Schluss, dass es nicht Cecile, sondern ihr schwerhöriger Mann Werner sein müsse, der dort goss, begannen auch seinen Namen zu rufen, aber auch darauf reagierte er nicht. Ich sagte zu Emme: Er muss praktisch schon ganz taub sein, und überlegte mir, dass er dann offenbar alles nur noch vom Munde abliest. Das leise trommelnde Geräusch des Wassers ging inzwischen immer weiter und hörte schliesslich auf, weil er offenbar mit dem Giessen fertig war. Andri war von dem allem nicht aufgewacht. Ich wachte dann aus dem Traum auf. (301 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2465 (1992-11-26 - Zürich)Einige Mädchen kamen zu Besuch. Es waren wohl alles Studentinnen, die vielleicht bei einem Kongress oder Treffen waren. Die erste ging ganz selbstverständlich einige Stufen die breite Treppe herunter, in die der Raum mündete, sodass diese Treppenfortsetzung gleichsam zum Raum gehörte, weil dort ein Stuhl stand und nicht so viele Stühle oben auf dem ebenen Teil des Raums standen, wie Personen hereinkamen. - Es war ein Stuhl mit einer elastischen Bespannung, wie wir sie auf dem Balkon haben. - Ich nahm, den Stuhl die Stufen hinauf und wir begannen, die Stühle im Kreis aufzustellen, damit alle zusammen sitzen konnten. Ausser Emme und mir waren auch Bille und Tina - auch eher noch im Studentinnenalter - da. Nach und nach sassen wir alle. Auch Inge Strauch war da, wie ich jetzt bemerkte, vielleicht in ihrer Eigenschaft als Prorektorin der Universität. Ich sagte: "Was hast denn Du für ein tolles Kleid an", denn sie hatte ein Kleid in einer leuchtenden Farbe an, das in einer bestimmten Höhe rundherum mit roten Stoffrosen besetzt war, so dass es wie ein Festgewand aussah. Dann bemerkte ich, dass sie auch einen Strauss langstieliger Rosen in der Hand hatte. Es fiel mir ein, dass sie in diesem Jahr einen runden Geburtstag hat - es ist der sechzigste - und dachte, dass das vielleicht heute sei. Dann hätte ich es versäumt, ihr rechtzeitig zu gratulieren und ich überlegte, was ich jetzt tun solle. Dabei wachte ich langsam auf. (240 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2467 (1992-11-27 - Zürich)Ich hatte mich verstiegen. Das kam so: Ich war mit einem leeren Sportkinderwagen unterwegs, den ich vor mir her schob. Es gab viele Hindernisse, ganz hohe Kantsteine, über die man mit dem Wagen kaum wegkam, baustellenartige Strassen und anderes. So musste ich einmal über so eine hohe Borte ausweichen, weil von hinten ein Auto durch die hohlwegartige Baustellenstrasse kam. Der Fusssteig, auf den ich so geriet führte immer mehr in die Höhe. Die Strassenböschung wurde zu einem Hügel und plötzlich fand ich mich auf dem schmaler werdenden Weg auf einer wandartigen Ansteigung über der Strasse, die nun zu hoch war, um herunterzukommen, aber auch nicht recht weiter führte. Ich musste noch durch ein ausgehobenes Loch, das mit einer weissen Masse ausgestreut war, die man aber betreten konnte, und konnte den Wagen noch über die Ränder heben. Dann stieg ich in eine Vertiefung, die so aussah, als ob man über sie einen Weg zurück auf die Strasse finden würde. Ich liess mich und den Wagen herab, aber nun ging es nicht weiter. Es war auch unmöglich, über die steile Böschung wieder zurück zu kommen. Die Brüstung aus Erde, auf der ich mit dem Wagen stand, war sehr schmal. Vor mir gähnte der Abgrund., weil es dort jäh in die Tiefe ging. Hinter mir drückte der Berg, als wolle er mich vor und in den Abgrund schieben. Mir wurde schwindlig. Ich sah keinen Ausweg und es wurde mir bewusst, dass ich mich verstiegen hatte. (242 words)

Allerlei Vorbereitungen unmittelbar vorher verschlangen die Zeit, sodass die Zeit immer knapper wurde und die Gefahr immer grösser, dass ich zu spät kam. Ich musste auch noch ein Stück mit der Strassenbahn dorthin fahren und auch dafür wurde es immer später. Auch Gespräche mit Emme, die mitkommen wollte, und anderen spielten eine Rolle. Es kamen immer neue Umstände hinzu, die die Zeit verschlangen, sodass die Gefahr immer grösser wurde, dass ich zu spät kommen würde und zugleich abgehetzt und nicht richtig vorbereitet sein würde. Zuletzt überlegte ich, ob ich nicht damit beginnen sollte, über diese Vorgeschichte zu sprechen, weil sie ja selbst soviel über das Wesen der Zeit und ihr Vergehen aussagte. (121 words)

Wir riefen deswegen laut Pro und Contra, Pro und Contra, weil jemand von uns unterwegs war, der das nicht wusste und deswegen in Gefahr geriet Auf diese Weise wollten wir ihn - oder sie - darauf aufmerksam machen, dass er bei den Tieren auf pro und contra achten müsse. - Ich rief ununterbrochen Pro und Contra, wovon ich schliesslich wohl erwachte.

Ein Mädchen, das auch da war, wollte zur nächsten Haltestelle laufen, weil sie dachte, dass die Zeit dafür noch reiche. Da näherte sich die Bahn aber schon und sie merkte, dass sie diesen Wettlauf nicht gewinnen könne, und kehrte zurück, um mit mir einzusteigen. Jetzt war es ein Flugzeug, das wir besteigen mussten. Man musste mühsam eine Art Leiter hochsteigen und oben in das Flugzeug übersteigen. Alle traten dort hinein. Ich sah den Boden, den sie betraten aber nicht, sodass es aussah, als ob sie in der Luft oder auf Glas stünden. Dann trat ich aber doch herüber und es gelang irgendwie. Jetzt waren aber die Plätze in der vorderen, wohl ersten Klasse, die wir brauchten, um den gewünschten Ort zu erreichen, alle schon ausgegeben. Das Mädchen und ich wollten zusammen bleiben. Da rückten die Leute zusammen, liessen das Mädchen herein und sagten: "Hier ist noch ein Platz" Sie rückte ohne weiteres dort herein, worüber ich enttäuscht war, weil ich gedacht hatte, sie würde das nicht tun, um mit mir zusammen zu bleiben. Nun zeigte sich, das noch ein anderer Platz unbesetzt war, der aber anscheinend keine Nummer hatte. Ich bereitete mich darauf vor, dies dem Schaffner zu erklären, der aber gerade nicht da war, und überlegte, wie ich ihn dazu bringen könne, mir den Platz ohne Nummer zu verkaufen, für den er wahrscheinlich kein gedrucktes Billet haben würde, weil diese anscheinend auch numeriert waren.Es sass jetzt noch ein anderer Mann auf dem Platz, der aber auch noch zur Seite rücken würde.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2474 (1992-12-07 - Zürich)Zuerst redigierte ich einen Text im Computer, dann Gespräch mit Sigmund Freud in seiner Klinik. Es war ein wenig die Situation wie bei Binswanger in Kreuzlingen. Es waren noch zwei andere junge Gesprächspartner da, wohl ein Student und eine Studentin. Freud erklärte etwas in einem längeren Gedankengang und stellte dann ebenfalls in zusammenhängender Rede noch etwas anderes dar, worauf ich antworten wollte. Nun ging aber der eine Gesprächspartner durch die Tür heraus und kurz danach auch die Studentin durch eine andere Tür, die eine Art Wandschrank war. Ich wartete deshalb mit meiner Erwiderung, weil ich dachte, dass sie gleich zurückkommen würden. Freud ging inzwischen zu dem Wandschrank, wo auch ein Waschbecken war, und trank etwas aus einem Glas. Plötzlich gab es einen Knall, wie wenn eine Glühbirne platzt, und das Glas in Freuds Hand platzte. Im selben Moment war auch er verschwunden. Ich dachte, dass er in eine der Türen des Wandschrankes gegangen sein könne, ging hin und machte beide nacheinander auf. Er war aber nicht da, stattdessen hing ein weisser Arztkittel, wie er ihn angehabt hatte, in einem der beiden Schränke. Ich fasste den Kittel, der sich weich und angenehm anfühlte, an und rief laut Freud, Freud, um ihn herbei zu rufen, wobei mir die Stimme zu versagen drohte, beziehungsweise sich nicht richtig modulieren liess, sodass es laut und hart klang. Im selben Moment wurde mir schlagartig klar, dass Freud ja längst tot ist und ich also mit einem Toten gesprochen hatte. Ich erwachte erregt. (246 words)

Es waren einzelne Dinge, die noch da lagen, wie zum Beispiel ein einzelnes Schinkenstück und anderes. Wir dachten oder sagten, dass wir es ja gut so machen könnten und diese Reststücke gemeinsam essen.

Ich war nun ein zweites mal auf dem Weg zum Augenarzt. Man musste von der Endstation des Verkehrsmittels noch ein Stück zu Fuss gehen. Es war ein Weg zwischen zwei alten Mauern, der aussah wie auf einem alten Gemälde, zum Beispiel von John Everet Millais. Am Ende des Weges sah ich einen Mann vor einem Wagen mit Bienen sitzen und erkannte, dass es der Augenarzt war, der diesmal Ähnlichkeit mit Dieter Wyss hatte. Es war klar, dass nun er nicht zum vereinbarten Termin im Behandlungszimmer sein konnte, und er deutete an, dass ja letztesmal ich die Ursache für die Verzögerung gewesen war. Ich versuchte, ihm die Ursache zu erzählen, doch er winkte ab. Ich ging nun für die Behandlung in das Haus und machte dabei vorsichtshalber einen etwas grösseren Bogen um die Bienen. (162 words)

Überlegte, dass, wenn ich jetzt dort hineinginge, ich längere Zeit für Gespräch und Begrüssung brauchen, also Emme, die auf mich wartete, warten lassen müsse.

Die oberste Treppe nun, die ins Dachgeschoss führte, wo die Quelle sein musste, war unterbrochen. Mehrere der freien Stufen dieser Dachtreppe fehlten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2482 (1992-12-15 - Zürich)Ich wollte in einem Malgeschäft irgendwelche Mal- oder Zeichenutensilien kaufen. Vor der Tür des Geschäfts stand eine riesige Menschenschlange, die noch ein grösseres Stück die Strasse füllte. Es wurde mir sofort klar, dass dies Leute seien, die hier eine bestimmte Kombination von weisser Farbe - irgendwie ähnlich wie Leimfarbe - und Zeichenstiften zum Ziehen von schwarzen Strichen kaufen wollten, um die Bilder der grossen Kandinsky-Ausstellung des Kunsthauses zu kopieren. Ich wollte deswegen zuerst umkehren, sah dann aber, dass die Schlange sich ziemlich schnell vorwärts bewegte, und beschloss, mich auch anzustellen, damit ich in das Geschäft und zu meiner Farbe käme. Dazu musste ich die Strasse überqueren, denn ich stand auf dem gegenüberliegenden Bürgersteig. In diesem Moment sprach mich eine Frau an und fragte. " Können sie mir sagen, warum da so eine grosse Schlange steht?". Ich erklärte es ihr und sagte, dass die Kandinskyausstellung gerade jetzt zum Kopieren freigegeben worden sei, denn es gäbe immer eine bestimmte Frist, in der man in Ausstellungen nicht kopieren dürfe und die sei jetzt gerade in diesem Moment abgelaufen, und die Leute würden sich hier so drängen, weil die abstrakten Bilder Kandinskys für sie leichter zu kopieren seien als gegenständliche Bilder. Es sei jetzt Mode, diese Ausstellung zu kopieren. Während dieser Rede sagte ich zu der Frau, dass ich jetzt herübergehen müsse, aber sie könne mich so lange noch begleiten, wenn sie es zu Ende erklärt haben wolle. Die Erklärung sei aber auch nur meine Vermutung und es könne vielleicht auch alles anders sein. Als wir die Strasse überqueren wollten, fuhr eine Strassenbahn vorbei, die wir erst vorüber lassen mussten. Nun hatte sich die Szene in der Weise gewandelt, dass es jetzt Tobias war, der mich begleitete, der aber schon etwas grösser war als in Wirklichkeit und schon reden konnte. Er begleitete mich auf einem etwas längeren Weg durch die Strassen. Es war aber im übrigen ganz die Fortsetzung der Scene, aus der es hervorgegangen war. Ich fragte ihn, ob er mich ein Stück begleiten wolle, oder etwas anderes vor habe und wo anders hin müsse. Er antwortete etwas verlegen, dass er eigentlich mich gesucht habe und mich hätte treffen wollen. Ich war darüber sehr gerührt und erwachte. (364 words)

Ich war sehr empört und auch besorgt darüber, denn wir wollten den Baum keineswegs fortgeben. Er war aber wegen seiner Grösse und seines Gewichts sehr schwer zurück zu transportieren und morgen war schon die Abfuhr, sodass es eilte, etwas zu unternehmen. Andererseits hatte ich vorher noch anderes zu unternehmen, wofür ich ebenfalls einen Termin hatte. Ich ärgerte mich noch nach dem Aufwachen eine Weile, bis ich ganz realisiert hatte, dass es ein Traum war, und dann allmählich merkte, dass ich ihn also aufschreiben sollte. - Vorher, noch im Traum, hatte ich noch überlegt, wen ich für den Rücktransport um Hilfe bitten könne.

Das ging vor allem dann gut, wenn jemand schon vorher da war. Das war bei mir der Fall. Es war vor allem die Schwierigkeit, das anderen Mitreisenden richtig klar zu machen, so dass dieser gemeinsame gleichzeitige Druck auf die sechs Sitze zu stande kam, die wie hölzerne Klappsitze in einem Kino oder Hörsaal waren. Ich hatte jemand gefunden, mit dem das möglich schien. Das Ganze war für die Weiterreise wichtig. Es war auch jemand dabei, der schon gestorben war und deshalb die nötige Handlung leichter ausführen konnte. Ich glaube, das war ich selbst, aber hier ist die Erinnerung nicht ganz klar. (131 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2485 (1992-12-19 - Zürich)Gespräch im Traum über den Traum und über das Traumsymbol des Pferdes. Das Gespräch fand in einem Fahrzeug, wohl in einem Zug, statt. Beim Aussteigen zog mich ein Mann, wohl ein Psychologieprofessor mit sich, um das Gespräch noch fortzusetzen. (39 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2486 (1992-12-20 - Zürich)Tobias sass auf dem Bett und spielte mit der Lampenschnur und dem darin eingebauten Knipser. Ich rief Nein, weil er das nicht tun sollte. Er spielte aber weiter und nahm nun auch den Knipser in den Mund. Nun wurde natürlich die Gefahr noch grösser und ich sprang herzu und zog den Stecker der Lampe am Boden schnell aus der Steckdose, weil das schneller ging, als ihm den Knipser zu entreissen. - Andere Szene, oder anderer Traum: Ich war aufgewacht und schrieb nun den Traum auf. Dabei sass ich in der Uni an der Brüstung des grossen Umgangs im Lichthof, an die ich mir einen Stuhl gezogen hatte und auf die ich das Papier zum Traumaufschreiben gelegt hatte. Eine Studentin guckte mir über die Schulter und lachte, wahrscheinlich, weil sie den Traum über das Enkelkind Tobias gelesen hatte. Es war aber auf der Nebenseite auch eine phallische Zeichnung, die einen erigierten Phallus zeigte, was sich wohl auf einen anderen Traum bezog. Ich überlegte, ob sie die auch gesehen haben könne, kam aber zu dem Schluss, dass sie dann wohl nicht gelacht haben würde. (182 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2487 (1992-12-21 - Zürich)Es war eine Hochzeit oder ähnliche Festlichkeit. Das Geld hatte nicht gereicht, um die Ausgaben zu bezahlen. Ich ging zur Bank und holte 200000 Mark oder Franken. Als ich mit dem Schein - es war offenbar ein einziger Schein für die grosse Summe - zurückkam, sagte man mir: Das ist genau die Höhe der Schulden. Ich war entsetzt und bestürzt über diese riesige Summe, zeigte das aber nicht, sondern machte gute Mine zum bösen Spiel, zog aber Emme mit mir durch den Flur, der wie die ganze Wohnung von der Festgesellschaft erfüllt war, um sie vor der Tür zu fragen, wie denn das zustande gekommen sein könne und was nun zu tun sei. Ich erwachte äusserst beunruhigt und mit Schuldgefühlen. (120 words)

Ich bin bezaubert von dieser mir ganz vertrauten Umgebung, in der ich jedes Haus und jeden Winkel kenne, und zeige es jemand, zu dem ich sage "Und dies ist die Piazza Navona". Immer wieder tauchen strahlende Barockpaläste in der Häuserfront der schmalen Gasse auf, in die wir uns mit irgendeinem Fahrzeug hinein bewegen. Dann umarme ich meine Begleiterin. Es ist ein bezauberndes Mädchen. Wir küssen uns und sind kurz vor der Vereinigung. (94 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2489 (1992-12-24 - Zürich)"Kann es sein, dass ich Dich kenne und Du doch als Vater Deiner Halbtochter ein Leutnant inzwischen bleibst oder sonstwas?" Diesen Satz sagte ein Kind zu mir, das sich für meine Halbtochter hielt. Es ist mir im Traum selbst nicht aufgefallen, dass das nicht geht, weil man wohl eine Halbschwester sein kann, aber nicht eine Halbtochter. Was das Kind eigentlich fragen wollte, war, ob man als Vater gleichzeitig noch etwas anderes sein kann, zum Beispiel Leutnant, bziehungsweise das noch bleibt, wenn man Vater geworden ist. Mit der Formulierung "Ich Dich kenne" war auch dies gemeint: "Ich Dich als Vater kenne" Und das bedeutete: "Ich Deine Tochter ,bzw. Halbtochter bin". (109 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2490 (1992-12-25 - Zürich)Ich fuhr mit einem Bus. Plötzlich geriet der Bus an die linke Strassenseite und wurde an eine Hauswand gedrückt. Ich war zwischen der Rückenlehne meines Sitzes und der Hauswand sanft eingeklemmt. Die Leute sagten, es sei ein Erdbeben. Es war, als ob die Hauswand neben mir sich sanft heben würde. Ich fürchtete, sie könne vielleicht einstürzen. Dann löste der Bus sich wieder etwas von der Hauswand und ich erwachte mit Kopfschmerzen. Zuerst war ich nicht sicher, ob das Erdbeben vielleicht in Wirklichkeit sei. Ich öffnete die Augen und sah die Welt ruhig stehen. So war ich sicher, dass es nur Traum gewesen war. (103 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2491 (1992-12-28 - Zürich)Ich ging durch eine Art Hotel, an verschiedenen Pförtnern vorbei, die ich kannte und mit denen ich wohl telephoniert hatte, ging aber rasch vorbei, da sie mich nicht sahen und ich Zeit sparen wollte. Von einem Kind liess ich mir eine Frucht geben, die gut gegen einen rauhen Hals war. Sie war aber schon etwas trocken und deswegen in der Wirkung abgeschwächt. Es war, als ob der Vater des Kindes es nicht ganz richtig fand, dass ich mir von dem Kind die Frucht geben liess. Dann war ich in einer Nachbarwohnung, die irgendwie zu der unseren spiegelverkehrt angelegt war aber an der Rückwand einen sehr schönen Kamin eingebaut hatte, der aber gerade nicht brannte. Ich bewunderte ihn. Dann war es im Zimmer meines Bruders. Ich hatte ein Bügeleisen in der Hand und berührte damit das Telephon. Dabei bekam ich einen leichten elektrischen Schlag und merkte daran, dass wohl gerade ein Anruf hereinkam. Es klingelte aber nicht, aber ich merkte, dass ein Teil des Telephons als Ganzes leicht aufleuchtete. Also nahm ich den Hörer ab, den ich zuerst noch so zurecht drehen musste, dass die Hörmuschel neben dem Ohr und das Mikrophon neben dem Mund war. Ich war mit den Bewegungen ungeschickt wie noch verschlafen. Ich meldete mich mit den Worten "Hier bei Uslar", weil es ja das Telephon meines Bruders war. Das kam mir aber komisch vor, weil ich ja selber Uslar heisse und - so gesehen - also bei mir selber wäre. Eine weibliche Stimme redete schnell und undeutlich. So verstand ich den Namen nicht und was für eine Institution es war, oder ob eine Privatadresse. Es war von einem Telegramm die Rede, das wohl abzuholen war. Ich sagte, dass ich gleich wenn er komme, mit meinem Bruder wegfahren werde und dass er auch morgen nicht da sein werde. Wir hatten zusammen eine Reise vor. Dann kam ich auf die Idee, mir das Telegramm vorlesen zu lassen. Es war von Pamela, die aber hier im Traum offenbar zu meinem Bruder gehörte, so wie in Wirklichkeit zu Bille, und lautete: "Ankomme morgen" Ich wusste, dass sie schon angekommen war, das Telegramm also veraltet sein musste, und überlegte, dass es nicht klug sei, ein Telegramm so abzufassen, da das, was heute morgen ist, später schon gestern sein kann. Während ich noch überlegte, was ich der Gesprächspartenerin am Telephon antworten sollte, erwachte ich allmählich. (392 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2492 (1992-12-28 - Zürich)Emme fuhr einen grossen schweren Lastwagen mit Anhänger, also einen ganzen Lastzug. Sie kam damit an mir vorbei durch die Strasse, wo der Trolleybus fährt und der Milchladen Baumann ist. Etwa in der Höhe des Briefkastens dort, wo ich auf der gegenüberliegenden Strassenseite stand, kam der Lastzug plötzlich zum Stehen. Alle vier Räder des Fahrzeuges und ebenso des Anhängers standen quer - in einer Weise, wie das ja eigentlich garnicht möglich ist. Ich ging zum Führerhaus und öffnete die Tür. Emme sass so am Steuer, wie sie dasitzt, wenn sie im Sitzen einschläft, war aber offenbar halbwach und hatte die Hand noch so am Steuer, dass man sah, dass sie das schwierige Fahrzeug mit aller Kraft beherrscht und zum Stehen gebracht hatte. Sie liess die Hand jetzt in nachlassender Anspannung vom Steuer sinken. (133 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2493 (1992-12-30 - Zürich)Traumszenen, von denen ich nur noch Bruchstücke erinnere. Zunächst spielte es auf einer Strasse, wie der Bahnhofstrasse, dann in einer Stoff- oder Tuchhandlung, die aber mehr einer Arztpraxis mit einer Sprechstundenhelferin glich. Diese gab mir eine Stoffstück, das mir gefiel. Es hatte eine wunderbare Griffqualität, eine silbrige Farbe mit glänzender brokatartig gegliederter und gemusterter Oberfläche. Später zu Haus, oder an einem anderen Ort, entdeckten es Freunde, die vorbeikamen und arangierten es - zusammen mit einem Fell und einem rotgold glitzernden Band, wie man es zum Verpacken von Weihnachtspäckchen verwendet, das schon etwas alt und kruselig war - zu einem fascinierenden Gewand. In diesem Moment kam der Besitzer der Stoffhandlung und Designer vorbei, der zugleich war wie der Arzt. Er war fasciniert von dem Stoffgebilde und fixierte es. Man wusste nicht, ob er skeptisch war über die Herkunft des Stoffes und überlegte, ob hier eine Art Entwurfsdiebstahl stattfand, oder ob er hingerissen war von den Designerfähigkeiten der Beteiligten oder von dem kleidungsstückartigen Gebilde, das da herauskam. Ich überlegte, dass ich ihm sagen wolle, es sei nur ein Spiel und seine Assistentin, die jetzt auch gerade wieder auftauchte, habe mir den Stoffrest gegeben. Dann erwachte ich allmählich.

Sie war sehr verwirrt und wusste die einfachsten Dinge nicht, zum Beispiel, dass Binswanger, den sie als einen Prüfungsgegenstand angegeben hatte, Psychiater war.Sie brach in Tränen aus. In dem Moment kam Emme mit Tobias herein, der sich ihr sofort zuwendete und zu ihr lief. Sie musste lachen und jetzt ging es wieder besser. Als die Prüfung fertig war und ich eine Note geben musste, überlegte ich, dass ich sie als hervorragende Studentin kannte und die Schwierigkeiten allein durch die Prüfungsaufregung bedingt waren und dass ich ihr deshalb eine 5-6 geben wollte. Dabei erwachte ich und behielt noch die Zahl 5-6 im Kopf wie etwas, das man auswendig lernen muss. (113 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2496 (1993-01-02 - Zürich)Ein Mann sitzt an der Decke eines hohen kuppelartigen Gewölbes. Er hat wohl ein Gerüst gehabt, auf dem er sass und das herabgefallen ist, sodass er sich jetzt an dem Gewölbe festklammern muss. Um herabzukommen, müsste er springen, doch dazu ist das Kuppelgewölbe viel zu hoch. Er hat dann aber einen kleinen Flugmotor, ein flügelartiges Gebilde, das sich schnell bewegt wie Insektenflügel und ihn kurz in der Luft hält, sodass er wie ein Insekt von einer Stelle des Gewölbes zur anderen burren kann und so allmählich etwas tiefer kommt. Schliesslich springt er doch herab, obwohl ich ihn noch davor zu warnen versuchte, und kommt am Boden an, wo er zunächst liegen bleibt, als alle herzu stürzen, sich aber doch wieder aufrichtet und noch am Leben ist. - Ich erwache und beschliesse, den Traum zuerst zu memorieren, dann aufzuschreiben, womit ich auch beginne. Dabei kann ich während des Schreibens in den Raum hineinsehen und das so Gesehene direkt in Worte fassen. Es sind eigentlich zwei hintereinander geschaltete Kuppelräume. Der Vordere aus Beton, eine perfekte Kuppel, schon sehr hoch, der hintere, in den ich durch den anderen hindurchblicken kann, noch höher und aus natürlichem Gestein. Ich bin entzückt von dieser faszinierenden Architektur und beschreibe sie begeistert. Dann erwache ich und merke, dass ich garnichts aufgeschrieben, sondern das Aufschreiben nur geträumt habe. Allmählich wird mir auch klar, dass das Aufgeschriebene nicht mit dem vorher Geträumten identisch ist, sondern als Raumbeschreibung sozusagen eine Art Vorgeschichte darstellt, von der zum eigentlichen Traumgeschehen mit dem Mann, der wie ein Insekt an der Decke sitzt, noch ein Zwischenstück fehlt, aus dem hervorgehen würde, wie er dorthin gekommen ist.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2497 (1993-01-04 - Zürich)In einem Restaurant ein unhöflicher Kellner. Es war in einem Restaurant, wo man sofort nach dem Essen, wenn ,man nichts Weiteres mehr bestellte, fortgescheucht wurde, damit der Tisch für andere frei würde. Dieser Kellner tat das in besonders unangenehmer Weise und wir - Emme und ich - erlebten das schon zum zweiten mal mit ihm. Er stellte sich direkt neben einen, machte ein scheussliches naserümpfendes und herablassendes Gesicht und sagte etwas Entsprechendes. Diesmal widersprach ich ihm und er benahm sich besonders flegelhaft. Das sagte ich ihm und er setzte sich, sich räkelnd auf einen Stuhl neben uns und legte die Beine auf den Tisch. Daraufhin wurde ich wütend und sagte: "Fort, sofort fort!" und zeigte mit dem ausgestreckten Finger in eine wegführende Richtung. Darauf erhob er sich und schlich gebückt von dannen. Ich wachte wütend auf und beschloss zunächst, diesen Traum nicht aufzuschreiben, weil ich mich so über den Mann geärgert hatte. (152 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2498 (1993-01-05 - Zürich)Eine Wohnung mit zwei Eingängen. Jemand erforscht diese neugierig. Er sieht den einen Eingang erst von innen, dann nähert er sich ihm von aussen. Er öffnet heimlich die Tür und steht zu seinem grossen Erstaunen vor einer Holzwand, durch die die Tür verschlossen ist. Ich schaue ihm zu. Es ist nicht klar, wie man überhaupt in die Wohnung hinein und heraus kommt, da auch mit dem anderen Eingang irgend etwas nicht stimmt. Andere Einzelheiten und den Handlungszusammenhang, in dem das Ganze steht, habe ich vergessen. (85 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2499 (1993-01-06 - Zürich)Wir waren auf Reisen in eine fremde Stadt geraten, die wir nicht kannten. Hier wiederum gerieten wir in den höhlenartig sich verzweigenden Keller eines Barockpalais. Es war ein System von Räumen von strahlendem Glanz, in einem ungeheuer heiteren, leichten und gelungenen Spätbarock oder Rokkoko. Bettina war einige Schritte weiter gegangen in einen anderen Raum. Emme und ich dachten darüber nach, welche Stadt es sein könne, in der wir uns befanden. Ich kam auf die Idee, durch eine Tür nach draussen zu gehen, um das Gebäude, das mir bekannt vorkam, vielleicht an der Fassade zu erkennen. Ich sah neben der Tür ein amtliches Wappenschild mit drei Löwen in weiss und gelb und dachte, es könne vielleicht Bayreuth sein und wir wären vielleicht in einem Rathaus oder Amtshaus dieser Stadt. Wir traten durch die Tür nach draussen und sahen zu unserem Erstaunen eine völlig schmucklose alte weisse Wand statt der erwarteten Barockfassade. Es war nur noch die untere Partie einer unscheinbaren Wand, wie die Ruine nach einem Bombenangriff, wie man so viele Städte nach dem Kriege kannte. Niemand hätte dahinter eine solche Barockpracht vermutet. Ich war fasziniert von diesem Gegensatz. Wir gingen einige Schritte in die Strasse hinaus, um das Ganze zu überblicken. Emme schaute forschend in die umliegende Häuserlandschaft, offenbar um Ausschau nach einem Lokal zu halten, weil sie Hunger hatte, und sagte etwas von einem Grill. Als wir versuchten, zu dem Gebäude zurück zu gelangen, gerieten wir plötzlich in einen Autostrom, der über einen brückenartigen Schienenstrang herankam. Niemand hätte hierin eine Autostrasse vermutet. Auch dies war improvisiert wie offenbar die ganze Stadt, so wie die Verkehrswege nach den Bombenangriffen des Kriegs sich zwischen den Trümmern hindurch wanden. Es waren aber hier keine Trümmer mehr zu sehen und es war ein buntes Leben in der Stadt. Wir sprangen vor den Autos zurück und überquerten, als sie vorbei waren, den Schienenstrang, wobei wir vorsichtig auftreten mussten, weil der Boden uneben und grün bewachsen war. Wir kehrten zu der Mauer mit dem Eingangstor zurück, immer noch die wunderbare Barockpracht im Inneren in Gedanken vor Augen, und wollten wieder eintreten und auch Tina drinnen wiedertreffen. Ich erwachte dabei mit der Melodie von "Auf Ansbach Dragoner, auf Ansbach Bayreuth" im Ohr und einem freundlich heiteren Gefühl. (371 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2500 (1993-01-07 - Zürich)Traum. Ich war in Amerika, wo alle um mich englisch sprachen, das ich nicht genügend beherrschte. Ich hatte aber einen sehr zuvorkommenden Begleiter, der mit mir deutsch sprach. Es war eine wissenschaftliche Umgebung, in der alles sehr gelassen zuging. Es war eine betont liberale Auffassung, die mir sehr behagte. Alles Instrumentale war gut, aber variabel, nicht so wichtig, nur Mittel zum Zweck. Dann wollten wir mit dem Taxi irgendwo hinfahren. Vielleicht war es aber auch kein Taxi, sondern ein Bekannter mit seinem Auto, der uns irgendwo hinbringen wollte. Ich überlegte, wie ich ihn ansprechen sollte, zum Beispiel Hallo zu ihm sagen. Die beiden gingen schon voraus aus dem Haus hinaus.Ich ging hinterher und sah sie draussen nicht, dachte, sie wären schon weiter gegangen und das Auto stünde etwas entfernt. Lief hinterher die Strasse entlang und beeilte mich. Dann merkte ich, dass sie direkt vor dem Haus etwas abseits bei dem Auto standen. Als ich kam, waren beide schon eingestiegen und ich überlegte, zu welcher Tür ich nun einsteigen müsse und was ich nun sagen solle, und erwachte. (177 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2502 (1993-01-09 - Zürich)Traum Ich fahre mit der Strassenbahn durch die Bahnhofstrasse, um ein Paket, das ich bei mir habe, zur Post zu bringen. Es enthält eine Wurst, die an Tante Bertel, die fast blinde Schwester von Emmes Mutter, geschickt werden soll. Herein kommt ein Polizist, der wie ein Kontrolleur auftritt und auch, wie diese es tun, kurz mit dem Fahrer redet und sich dann den Leuten zuwendet. Er kontrolliert die Sachen, die man bei sich hat,wie beim Zoll. An vielen geht er vorbei. Als er zu mir kommt sagt er etwas des Sinnes wie: "Was machen wir denn?", und ich antworte: "In die Stadt fahren" und setze hinzu: "Da sind wir ja schon. Ich fahre zur Post." Er will nun das Paket kontrollieren, das aber mit etwas anderem verbinden, nämlich der Möglichkeit, über die er verfügt, den Kontrollierten zum Essen einzuladen. Er zieht ein Stück Papier aus der Tasche, das aussieht wie ein Zeitungsausschnitt, wo er etwas ankreuzen muss, wie bei einem einzuschickenden Gutschein, und beginnt eine anscheinend schon dafür feststehende Rede im Frage-und-Antwort-Stil, zum Beispiel, ob ich Wein dazu trinken wolle. Ich kenne durch eine Erzählung von Emme schon dieses Ritual und gehe darauf ein. Er steckt den Zettel flüchtig in die Tasche. Ich überlege noch, dass er mich schliesslich fragen wird, was in dem Paket sei und dass ich antworten werde: "Eine Wurst für eine alte, fast blinde Frau. - Ich weiss , das klingt wie eine erfundene Geschichte, aber es stimmt wirklich" Im Laufe dieser Überlegung wache ich auf.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2503 (1993-01-10 - Zürich)Traum von einem Stern. Alle Einzelheiten habe ich jetzt vergessen, erinnere aber deutlich, dass ich danach weiter träumte, ich sei aus dem Traum erwacht und hatte - also in Wirklichkeit noch im Traum - nun eine Menge Einfälle, die in immer andere Richtungen gingen und sich sozusagen sternförmig um den Traum vom Stern bildeten und sich dabei auch irgendwie gegenseitig widersprachen oder in dialektischer Weise einander ablösten. Dieses Phänomen beschäftigte mich noch während dieses Träumens von den Einfällen sehr. Dann erwachte ich richtig und begann, Traum und Einfälle zu memorieren, schlief aber wieder ein und vergass alles Inhaltliche ausser dem Stern, behielt aber genau diese Struktur. (106 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2504 (1993-01-11 - Zürich)Traum. Ich war im Wartezimmer eines Arztes. Ich hatte mich schon vor langem angemeldet und lag wartend auf einer Couch, die dort stand und erwartete aufgerufen zu werden. Neben mir standen Menschen Schlange, wobei sich diese Reihe langsam weiterbewegte. Allmählich standen ganz andere Leute neben mir als am Anfang. Ich merkte, dass die Schlange sich auf eine Tür zu bewegte. Auch fiel mir auf, dass niemand sich setzte. Ich stand auf und fragte die Leute und erfuhr, dass man hier für den Arzt Schlange stand. Man sagte, ich könne nicht mehr damit rechnen, dran zu kommen, da gerade gesagt worden sei, dass man nur noch bis 12 Uhr dran komnme , und hier ja noch viel mehr Leute vor mir stünden. Ich war erstaunt und empört, denn ich hatte mich schon gegen neun Uhr angemeldet. Vorne stand eine Frau, die zwar keinen weissen Kittel trug aber aussah, als sei sie eine Arzthelferin. Ich fragte, ob ich mit der reden solle und sagte oder dachte, dass ich doch dann wenigstens gleich nach dem Mittag drankommen müsse, und erwachte. (177 words)

Es waren schwarz-weiss-Bilder, wohl Stiche. Sie trugen zum Teil Spuren, die ich mit einem Radiergummi entfernte. Dabei entstanden Rückstände - Teile des Gummis und das Abradierte -, die ich so gut es ging wegpustete. Der Rest blieb noch zwischen den Blättern liegen. Ich dachte, dass ich sie später noch entfernen müsse. (68 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2506 (1993-01-13 - Zürich)Wir, die Familie, hatten eine Art Schliessfach bei der Bank, in das man einerseits Geld einzahlen konnte, dass dann Zinsen trug, andererseits aber auch Gebühren für das Fach zahlen musste. Ich hatte lange nicht daran gedacht. Als es mir aber einfiel und ich in Gedanken die finanzielle Lage überschlug, wurde mir klar, dass schon seit ganz langen Zeiten nichts eingezahlt wurde, die Gebühren aber weiterliefen. Es konnten Tausende von Mark sein, die wir zahlen mussten. Ich ging mit jemand hin, um das zu erkunden. Ich sah jemand am Schalter, der offenbar in ähnlicher Lage war. Der Beamte sagte, dass er Glück gehabt habe, weil durch irgend einen Umstand die Gebühren nicht so hoch waren, sodass er nur wenig dazuzahlen musste. Dann war ein Familienmitglied da, ich glaube Bille oder mein Bruder, und sagte: "Da musst Du Dich lieber nicht blicken lassen", erklärte aber , dass die Gebührenzahlungspflicht nach einiger Zeit aufhöre, also die zu zahlende Summe sich nicht weiter kumuliere. Ich kehrte also mit ihr um, jetzt war es , glaube ich, Bille. Als wir andere Familienmitglieder trafen, begann ich das zu erzählen. Nun sagte aber Bille, sie wisse das eigentlich nicht richtig, sie habe bloss angenommen, dass es so sei. Die Sorgen begannen also wieder von neuem und ich erwachte. (211 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2507 (1993-01-14 - Zürich)Es ging um die vielen Lizentiatsarbeiten, die ich noch betreut habe. Ich hatte die Titel alle in eine Liste schreiben müssen und telephonierte nun mit einem Kollegen, der sie offenbar nochmal neu in eine Liste schreiben musste. Er sagte: "Es ist ganz schwierig. Die Titel gehen garnicht in die Spalte" Ich erkundigte mich, und er sagte. "Es ist die selbe Liste, in die der Dekan die Titel schreibt, und die Spalte ist zu schmal für diese Titel". Es wurde klar, dass er dabei war, die Titel alle zu kürzen. Ich protestierte und sagte: "Sie können die Titel nicht einfach kürzen. Sie kennen ja die Arbeiten garnicht. Dann muss man die Liste eben ändern und die Spalte breiter machen." Ich war empört bei dem Gedanken, dass man hier aus bürokratischen Gründen einfach willkürlich und ohne Rücksicht auf die Verfasser die Titel der Arbeiten ändern wollte, zumal ich sowieso immer dafür gesorgt hatte, dass die Titel nicht zu lang waren.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2508 (1993-01-15 - Zürich)Ich war mit Corinne in der Bank. Es war eine Halle ähnlich wie in der Schweizer Bankgesellschaft, aber doch ein bisschen anders. Die Deckenkonstruktion war aus Metall - wie aus der Zeit um die Jahrhundertwende, während sie in der Bahnhofstrasse aus Stein ist. Der Mann am Schalter rechnete für mich den Stand des Kontos aus, während wir warteten. Er prüfte dabei einen gedrucktem Auszug der Vorgänge und sagte: "Hier stimmt etwas nicht. Es ist nur ein kleiner Betrag, der nicht stimmt, aber ich will es nochmal nachprüfen". Aus einem Lautsprecher kam Musik, wie in den Warenhäusern, und eine Stimme sagte auf französich etwas an in dem Sinne wie: "Diese Musik wird ihnen geboten von..." und dann hiess es nach dem Wort für "geboten": "a la directienne". Ich sagte vor mich hin: "Ich wusste garnicht, dass die hier eine Direktorin haben." Ich schloss das aus der weiblichen Wortform. Corinne hatte mich nicht richtig verstanden und fragte nach. Ich sagte, auch möglichst leise.: "Ich rede nicht gern laut über das Französiche, weil ich es nicht richtig kann und mich nicht blamieren will". Corinne hatte noch einige Formulare aus knitterigem dünnen Papier in der Hand, die aussahen wie die Durchschläge von Überweisungs- oder Dauerauftragsformularen. Sie wollte wohl von dem Beamten weitere solche Formulare erbitten, Er war aber noch beim Rechnen. (217 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2509 (1993-01-16 - Zürich)Ich fuhr mit einem Trolleybus in den Aussen- oder Vorortbezirken einer Stadt, und zwar in Richtung auf das Stadtinnere, wohin ich zurückkehren musste. Zuerst war der Bus noch voll und ich fand einen Platz zwischen vielen Menschen. Dann wurde es leerer und ich suchte mir einen Platz am Ende des Busses, wo ich durch ein Rückfenster hinaussehen konnte. Es war eine sehr schöne Landschaft. Es war schon dunkler geworden, so dass die Landschaft bläulich aussah, und ich blickte in Baumsilhouetten und durch sie hindurch. Plötzlich bemerkte ich, dass der Bus garnicht mehr fuhr und auch schon leer war und alle Innenlichter ausgeschaltet. Ich rief: "Halt - ist denn hier schon das Ende?", denn es war noch nicht im Inneren der Stadt - und beschloss, schnell auszusteigen, ehe der Bus womöglich abgeschlossen wurde. Zuerst musste ich aber noch meine Sachen einsammeln, die ich vor mir auf einem Tisch ausgebreitet hatte. Da es dunkel war, musste ich danach tasten und konzentrierte mich, das ruhig und sorgfältig zu machen, weil ich wusste, dass mir sonst wesentliche Gegenstände hinterher fehlen würden, wenn der Bus in irgend eine Garage gefahren würde. So sammelte ich tastend ein: meine Ledertasche, in der Ausweise, Geld, Schlüssel und andere Dinge immer beisammen sind. Dann die Brillentasche, in der die Lesebrille und der Kugelschreiber sind, also das, was ich zum Schreiben brauche. Und schliesslich die leichte wollene rote Unterziehjacke, die ich jetzt immer bei mir habe und je nach Bedarf an- oder ausziehe. Ich erwischte sie, die schwerer zu tasten war als die beiden Ledertaschen, an einem Ärmel. Dann erhob ich mich und eilte zu einem der Ausgänge. Es wurde mir allmählich deutlich, dass niemand, auch kein Fahrer mehr, in dem Bus war, der anscheinend auf der Landstrasse stand. Ich rief vorsichtshalber "Hallo", dass falls doch vorne noch ein Fahrer war, er auf mich aufmerksam würde, ehe er abschloss, bekam aber keine Antwort. Als ich vor der Ausgangstür stand, die geschlossen war, fiel mir ein, dass es dort immer Hebel gibt, bei denen ein Schild steht: "Im Notfall hier öffnen". Ich beschloss also, nach diesem Griff zu tasten, und erwachte, als ich im Begriff war, die Hand dafür zu heben. Im Moment des Erwachens, merkte ich, dass ich mit angezogenen Beinen im Bett auf der Seite liegend, die Hand zwischen die Knie geklemmt hatte, sodass sie festgelegt war. Sie war dabei genau in der Stellung oder Haltung wie im Traum in dem Moment, als ich beschloss, sie zu heben, um nach dem Notfallöffnungsgriff zu tasten. Im Traum war sie aber nicht zwischen den Knien. (424 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2510 (1993-01-17 - Zürich)Ich sprach am Telephon mit Bille. Wir hatten uns über irgend etwas gestritten. Es entstand eine Art Schweigepause. Ich wollte aber verhindern, dass das Gespräch abgebrochen würde, und erwachte mit diesem Gefühl. --Traum: Ich sprach am Telephon mit Bille. Sie wirkte aber eher launisch: manchmal herablassend, dann wieder tadelnd zornig, dann gnädig. Ich ärgerte mich darüber, zumal es um eine Sache für sie ging bei dem Gespräch. Schliesslich, als es nicht besser wurde, wurde ich wütend und sagte, dass mir das nicht gefalle, und beschrieb ihr Verhalten und dass ich keine Lust habe, so zu reden. Es entstand eine Art Schweigepause, in der sie betroffen wirkte. Ich wollte aber verhindern, dass das Gespräch abgebrochen würde, und erwachte mit diesem Gefühl und dem Gefühl des Zorns. Im Erwachen verband sich dies Gefühl mit einem Bauchschmerz, den ich hatte, eigentlich einem Schmerz, wie er bei einer Verkrampfung der Bauchmuskeldecke entsteht.. (148 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2512 (1993-01-18 - Zürich)Ich war mit Emme in Paris. Wir sollten länger dort bleiben und ich hatte irgendeine Aufgabe. Ich fühlte mich aber fremd und hatte Heimweh. Ich wunderte mich selbst darüber, weil früher einmal Paris für mich ein erstrebtes Ziel war. Es spielte eine Rolle, dass ich die Sprache nicht konnte. Ich ging durch eine Strasse und die Kleider der Leute störten mich. Ein Entgegenkommender hatte einen blaugelben Pullover an, dessen Muster harlekinartig war. Emme sagte irgendetwas des Sinnes, dass wir weniger eng zusammenleben müssten. Ausgerechnet jetzt sagte sie das, wo ich mich hier sowieso schon fremd fühlte. Ich wachte unglücklich auf. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2513 (1993-01-19 - Zürich)Ich holte Bille von der Bahn ab. Es war wie in einem der ehemaligen Ostblockländer, wo die Kontrollen lange dauerten und man deswegen warten musste. Bille musste durch ein Tor in einer Mauer kommen, über die man aber bei bestimmter Stellung auch hinwegkucken konnte. Man sah die Leute einen Berg hinaufkommen wie von einem angelegten Schiff heraufkommend. Schliesslich hörte ich Billes Stimme und sah sie dann auch, ganz am Ende derGruppe, deren Anfang schon das Tor durchquerte, so dass ich suchend in beide Richtungen, vor das Tor und über die Mauer hinter das Tor blicken musste. Ich rief sie an und wir trafen uns am Tor. Emme ,die auch da war, war zwischendurch in den Ort gegangen, um noch etwas zu holen. Wir sahen sie vor dem Gebäude des kleinen ländlichen Bahnhofs auf einem Liegestuhl liegen , zugedeckt mit meiner Strickjacke und eingeschlafen. Ihre Lippen waren stark rot geschminkt. Bille sagte: "Ah, hat man hier sogar Kissen", weil sie meine Strickjacke für ein Kissen hielt. Es war wie in einem Kurort. Emme erwachte, als sie uns hörte. Sie hatte sich dort hingelegt, weil sie mich, als sie zurückkam, nicht sah, weil ich schon den Platz bei dem Mäuerchen eingenommen hatte, wo ich die Ankommenden früher sehen konnte. - Bevor ich im Bahnhof war, war ich schon im Hotel gewesen, wo ich ein besonderes Zimmer ergattert hatte, das wie ein kleines Abteil für sich und von innen abschliessbar war. Das war deswegen etwas Besonderes, weil es zugleich auch eine Eisenbahn war, wo die anderen Leute nebeneinander in Abteilen sassen. Ich hatte also in dieser Eisenbahn etwas wie ein Hotelzimmer, aus dem ich nun herauskam und überlegte, ob ich das Extraabteil auch von aussen abschliessen konnte,so dass meine Sachen sicher waren. Gleichzeitig war es aber doch ein Hotel und gehörte zu den billigeren im Ort, während die teureren, in denen es ganze Zimmersuiten gab, in einem anderen Ortsteil lagen, den ich an einem Berghang sehen konnte, der aber in seiner modernen Bebauung weniger schön wirkte. Ich ging dann von da aus zum Bahnhof, um Bille abzuholen - die Szene, die ich zuerst beschrieben habe. Auch Emme war mit mir in diesem Ort, ich war aber in der vorhergehenden Szene allein in dem abteilartigen Zimmer oder zimmeratrtigen Abteil. (375 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2514 (1993-01-20 - Zürich)Ich ging mit Emme durch den Wald spazieren. Die Fahrerin eines Leichtmotorrades, die von hinten kam, konnte nicht mehr ganz bremsen und traf mich leicht mit dem Vorderrad, sodass ich von hinten mit dem Reifen des Vorderrades einen Schlag ans Bein bekam. Emme dachte, dass wir umkehren müssten und erkundigte sich nach dem möglichen Rückweg, was aber schwierig war, weil wir nicht ganz genau wussten, wo wir waren. Ich sagte, dass es garnicht schlimm sei und wir einfach weiter gehen könnten. Mehr erinnere ich nicht aus dem Traum. (88 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2516 (1993-01-22 - Zürich)Ich bin bei der Perpetua-Kirche. Doch kann ich auf meinem Weg kaum vorwärtskommen. Alle meine Glieder sind ungeheuer müde und schwer. Ich muss irgendwo hin, doch reicht die Zeit kaum dazu. Zeitweise bewege ich mich ohne die Beine zu bewegen, wie im Gang angehalten, ganz langsam. Es wird immer später. Die Kirche ist zwar die Perpetua-Kirche, hat aber im Traum eine andere Lage wie auf einem Berg über mir - wie die Leonhardskirche in Basel. Dann ist es auch wieder wie am Ufer eines Stroms. In einer anderen Szene bin ich zu Hause und will in die Badewanne gehen, weil ich mich so erschöpft fühle. In der Wanne sind aber schon Bille und Tina, die zusammen baden, sodass ich nicht hinein kann. (122 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2517 (1993-01-25 - Zürich)Wir, eine Gruppe von Leuten, hatten eine Art Kursus oder Seminar, der in einer Strassenbahn stattfand, in der wir auch wohnten. Die Strassenbahn fuhr immer ein Stück durch die Gegend, was gleichzeitig auch wie eine Art Ausflug oder Reise war, und hielt dann eine Zeit lang an, in der der Kurs stattfand und man über ein Thema redete. Dann fuhr man wieder ein Stück, und ab und zu ging man auch hinaus. Ich überlegte mir, dass es in der Strassenbahn keine Toilette gab und man also, wenn man einen See machen müsse, hinausgehen müsse, was aber nur in solchen Momenten möglich wäre, wo die Strassenbahn anhielt und nicht zugleich schon ein Kurs stattfand. Man müsse dann dafür wohl gleichzeitig hinausgehen und die Leute würden draussen stehen. Erwachen mit starkem Blasenandrang. (130 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2518 (1993-01-24 - Zürich)Ich fahre mit Emme in einem Art Reiseschlitten den Berg hinunter durch eine Schneelandschaft. Ich sitze hinter ihr, sie sitzt vorne und lenkt und bremst, wozu sie irgend eine Vorrichtung hat. Es geht durch ein Waldstück und die Fahrt wird immer schneller. Ich sage zu ihr: "Fahr nicht so schnell", weil es ziemlich steil auf einem schmalen Weg durch den Bergwald bergab geht. Sie bremst aber nicht und der Schlitten beschleunigt sich immer mehr. Ich rufe sie nocheinmal an, aber sie reagiert nicht. Ich merke, dass sie eingeschlafen ist, und versuche, an ihr vorbei und um sie herumfassend, die Steuerung und die Bremseinrichtung in die Hand zu bekommen, und strecke auch die Füsse nach der Bremse aus. Dabei gerät meine Hand zwischen ihre Zähne, wo ich sie lasse, um die im Schlaf locker geöffneten Kiefer auseinander zu halten,damit sie nicht geschädigt werden, falls wir gegen einen Baum fahren. Noch folgt der Schlitten von selbst der Führung des Weges, aber vor uns liegt eine stärkere Rechtskurve, vor der ich Steuer und Bremse in die Hand bekommen muss. Ich erwache, während der Schlitten noch in schneller Fahrt ist, mit starken Kopfschmerzen und zugleich mit aufgestelltem Glied. (194 words)

Die Bilder sind nach einer neuen Methode gemacht, bei der die Photos aus etwas dickerem Papier sind als sonst . Als ich zu Hause die Bilder ankucke, merke ich, dass der grösste Teil leer ist und völlig weiss. Nur die ersten etwa 10 Bilder sind da, der Rest sind leere weisse Blätter. Ich überlege, was ich tun soll, überzeuge mich, dass die Filme und auch der Kassenzettel noch da sind, und denke darüber nach, ob ich jetzt bei Jelmoli anrufen oder direkt hingehen soll. (94 words)

Aus dem Pullover hing auf der Rückseite ein kleines verknotetes Fadenstückchen heraus. Emme wollte das abschneiden. Ich wollte das nicht, weil ich dachte, dass das Gestrick sich dann vielleicht auflösen würde und mir auch dachte, dass sie sicher Grund gehabt hätte, das nicht abzuschneiden. Emme dagegen fand das ganz sinnlos und kam mit einer kleinen Schere, um es doch abzuschneiden. Ich sagte: "Ich will's nicht", aber sie sah das nicht ein und wollte dem Faden unbedingt mit der Schere zu Leibe rücken. Ich sagte wiederholt "Ich wills nicht, ich wills nicht", weil sie mit ihrer Absicht nicht aufhören wollte, weil sie offenbar fand, dass die Sache in Ordnung gebracht werden müsse. Schliesslich wachte ich auf bei dem weiteren "Ich wills nicht"-Sagen. (136 words)

Wir betreten das Zimmer und öffnen das Fenster. Der Mann schiebt eine Frau hinein. Man weiss nicht, ob es eine Leiche und er ein Mörder ist. Ich versuche den Mann festzuhalten.

Der Buchändler fragte, ob es wohl möglich wäre, den Gregor, ihr kleines Kind, dabei zu haben. Das schien die Voraussetzung für die Durchführung zu sein, weil sie offenbar niemand hatten, der ihn im Moment währenddesssen hüten konnte. Ich war schon im Begriff, zu Hartmann zu gehen und ihn zu holen, als der Zweifel aufkam, ob es mit Gregor dabei gehen würde, denn er war noch so klein, dass man wohl nicht sicher sein konnte, dass er ruhig bleiben und nicht stören würde.(121 words)

Sie begrüssen einen vertraut und doch mit einem gewissen Abstand. Auch grosse Mengen von Fröschen leichen dort im Wasser. Es ist überhaupt ein Ort am Wasser. Ich erzähle auch jemand von diesem Ort.

Es sind Arbeiten etwa wie Lizentiatsarbeiten, es können aber auch solche zum Beispiel im Jung-Institut gewesen sein. Ein Gremium hat offenbar darüber beraten. Er sagt, man habe gefunden, dass jeweils der erste Teil doch sehr in Richtung Dante sei und man das noch bedenken müsse. Ich bin darüber verärgert, sage aber , dass ja ich die Zusammenfassungen geschrieben habe und mir selbst aufgefallen sei, dass hier ein Anklang an Dante erkennbar sei - speziell an die Übersetzung von Michael Streckfuss.- Es handle sich ja auch hier überall um etwas, das an Unterwelt anklingt. Der Stilanklang hinge also mehr mit meinem Stil zusammen. Er wisse ja, dass das alles von mir selbst geschrieben sei und, wie es immer ist, unter Zeitdruck, so dass diese Einheitlichkeit dadurch zu Stande komme. Es freue mich indess, dass offenbar unter ihnen jemand sei, der Dante kenne, denn nur so sei ja diese Bemerkung möglich gewesen. (163 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2529 (1993-02-12 - Zürich)Eine Sitzung in der Uni, doch war es zugleich eine solche der Uno. Inge Strauch - sie ist ja Prorektorin - hatte verhandeln müssen mit den Leuten aus Tadschikistan. Es ging um Dinge an der Mündung der Donau. Sie stellten hier Forderungen, die nicht erfüllbar waren. Dann ging es um Ideen eines Herren Yaffrages. Er war Professor, doch hatte ich noch nie von ihm gehört. Seine Forderungen waren aber ebenfalls politische im Rahmen der Uno. Es war eine Sitzung von vier, fünf Leuten an einem langen Tisch, wie sie oft in alten Sitzungsräumen der Uni stehen. Ich hatte mein Nachthemd an und darüber eine Strickjacke. Irgendwann bekam ich das Gefühl, dass es nicht die richtige Kleidung wäre. Ich konnte sie aber ja jetzt ad hoc nicht ändern und versuchte sie darum souverän zu tragen. Der Mann neben mir schien sie aber gut zu finden und sie schien ihm zu imponieren. In einer Pause gingen wir hinaus. Ich ging durch die Gänge der Uni und kam zu dem Eingang hinaus, durch den ich sie immer über eine Rampe betrete. Doch waren die räumlichen Verhältnisse etwas anders als in Wirklichkeit. Hier sah ich ein Schild an der Wand mit dem Namen von Herrn Professor Yaffrages, das ich zuvor nie bemerkt hatte. Es gab ihn also wirklich. Ich überlegte, ob ich vor dem Wieder-Reingehen meine braune Wollhose anziehen solle, oder ob es mir dann zu warm würde. Der Traum endete aber noch in dieser Pause. (242 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2530 (1993-02-12 - Zürich)ich wollte noch das psychologische Examen machen, das ich noch nicht hatte und das zu machen ich seit langem vorhatte und worauf ich hinarbeitete. Dafür brauchte ich noch ein Referat über ein Steifftier. Dieses wollte ich bei René Hirsig machen. Das Steifftier, das ich dafür zum Gegenstand machen wollte, lag schon bereit. Ich ging also zu René Hirsig. Emme war auch dabei. Das Tier, das im Zimmer auf dem Boden lag, vergass ich mitzunehmen, als ich das Zimmer abschloss. So beschloss ich, die Sache nur verbal zu erklären, ohne das Tier vorzuzeigen. Ich sagte also René Hirsig, um was es ging, und bat ihn, das zu akzeptieren. Zu meinem Erstaunen schwieg er, statt zu antworten, als ob er noch darüber nachdenken müsste. Er schwieg aber so lange, dass man deutlich merkte, dass er ein Problem darin sah. Offenbar fand er, dass es nicht möglich sei, dass ich als Psychologieprofessor noch das psychologische Examen mache. Dies war mir aber sehr wichtig. Ich war darum verärgert, liess dies aber natürlich mir nicht anmerken und sagte, das lange Schweigen brechend, dass ich mir irgend eine andere Lösung ausdenken wolle, und ging mit Emme weg. Es kam mir noch in den Sinn, dass er neulich in einem Gespräch die Wendung benutzt hatte: "Ich als Nichtpsychologe kann diese Dinge leichter durchschauen als die anderen". Nach dem Erwachen ärgerte ich mich noch eine Weile, bis mir einfiel, dass ich ja in Wirklichkeit das Psycholgische Examen längst gemacht habe, es also wirklich besitze und Diplompsychologe bin.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2532 (1993-02-13 - Zürich)Traum. Wir wollten in ein Konzert, Emme und Belli und Tina und ich. Es war Bachsche Musik. Es war schon sehr spät, gerade noch eine halbe Stunde, und der Weg in die Stadt weit, sodass wir eigentlich länger brauchten. Aber alle waren noch garnicht fertig. Emme wollte unbedingt noch einen Brief fertig machen, suchte die Briefmarken, die Anderen, auch ich, noch nicht fertig angezogen, die Töchter noch auf ihren Betten liegend. Ich sagte wiederholt und immer eindringlicher: "Wir kommen zu spät! Wir kommen zu spät!" Emme hörte nicht auf, den Brief noch fertig zu machen. Ich sagte: "Dazu hast Du jetzt keine Zeit. Du kannst es hinterher machen. Ich stecke Dir den Brief dann ein". Belli und Tina erhoben sich sehr langsam von den Betten. Ich selbst war dabei, meine Socken anzuziehen, aber sie passten nicht auf die Füsse und fühlten sich auch falsch an. Es waren rote Socken. Ich fragte Emme : "Sind es deine?" Belli sagte trocken: "Es sind meine". So ging alles unglaublich langsam. Inzwischen waren es nur noch zwanzig Minuten. Ich überlegte mir den Weg. War das Konzert im Kaufhaus-Saal? Aber der Kaufhaussaal war doch in Freiburg, nicht hier in Zürich. Auch Ort und Weg zum Konzert waren also irgendwie unklar. - Andere Szene, vorher oder hinterher: In Schwerin in unserer alten Wohnung. Ich war in meinem Zimmer, das jetzt Willi und Hille Simons Schlafzimmer ist. Ich lag auf meinem Bett, der ganze Raum, alles war ungeheuer klar und deutlich und ich war glücklich darüber. Es war auch im Traum so, dass es jetzt war und zugleich wie Erinnerung an früher. deshalb war ich so froh darüber, dass alles so deutlich war. (276 words)

Er sagt freundlich und besorgt, dass er das Essen schon etwas in der Mitte geteilt hat, und zeigt auf ein rötliches Gemüsestück, das noch etwas hart geblieben zu sein scheint. Er ist in seinem Verhalten sehr kollegial und versucht in kameradschaftlicher Weise, das Beste aus der Situation zu machen. Ich beginne, zu essen und ziehe dabei ganz automatisch den Teller etwas an mich heran, merke aber dann gleich, dass das ja nicht geht, weil er in der Mitte zwischen uns beiden und deshalb in einem gewissen Abstand vom Tischrand stehen muss, und schiebe ihn schnell wieder zurück.

In einer der Haltestellen hörte man eine Stimme, wohl aus dem Lautsprecher, sagen: "Der Zug fährt falsch". Dann fuhren wir ziemlich schnell rückwärts. Ich dachte zuerst, dass ich vielleicht in den Zug geraten sei, der nicht nach Greenwich , bzw zur gegenüberliegenden Ile of Dogs und Island Gardens, sondern zu einer anderen Endstation fährt, kam dann aber auf die Idee, dass der Zug vielleicht aufs falsche Geleis geraten sei und hielt Ausschau nach einem entgegenkommenden Zug, der ja dann, da wir nun rückwärts fuhren, hinter uns her kommen müsste, sah aber, durch das führerlose Zug-Cockpit hinausblickend, keinen anderen Zug kommen. Dann waren wir angehalten und hinausgegangen in eine schlickartige Uferlandschaft, wartend auf die Weiterfahrt. Es geschah aber nichts. Ich sagte: "Wo sind wir eigentlich? Da ist etwas schief gegangen.", und überlegte, nach Dieter Sträuli zu rufen, der als mein Assistent offenbar dabei war. Ich war jetzt ziemlich allein in dieser unbewachsenen, dünenartigen Landschaft und hatte meine Cordhose ausgezogen, um es mir bequem zu machen, sah in der Ferne aber andere ebenfalls wartende Leute.

Ich gehe dem Geräusch nach und merke, dass es aus der Küche kommt. Ich klopfe an den Türrahmen in der Erwartung, dass es , wenn es zum Beispiel eine Maus ist, dann weglaufen wird. Aber es hört nicht auf und ich merke, dass es aus einem am Boden liegenden Plastiksack kommt. Es wird nun deutlich, dass es Insekten, wohl eine Art von Fliegen, sein müssen, die dort alle an etwas, zum Beispiel irgendwelchen Lebensmitteln, sitzen müssen, die sie wohl fressen oder in denen sie sich ausgebreitet haben. Ich überlege, dass ich den Sack vielleicht zum Fenster rauswerfen kann und sie dann draussen aus dem Sack als grosser Schwarm auffliegen werden. Es besteht aber auch die Gefahr, dass sie bei diesem Versuch schon vorher, noch in der Wohnung, auffliegen werden. Langsames Erwachen bei solchen Überlegungen. Beunruhigung von der Vorstellung des auffliegenden Insektenschwarms. Auch die Vorstellung, dass der Sack dann draussen den Leuten aus dem Haus, die morgens auf dem Weg vor dem Fenster vorbeigehen, im Wege liegen wird. (190 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2540 (1993-02-21 - Zürich)Ich hatte den Raster eines Monatskalenders, wo unten die Tage und Daten quer angebracht waren und man oben ein Bild im Breitformat einsetzen konnte. Jemand sollte das für mich kopieren. Er aber hatte mich falsch verstanden und zerschnitt den Raster so, dass daraus viele kleine in der Grösse eines Abreisskalenders entstanden, kleinere senkrechte Rechtecke, in die man oben auch jeweils nur kleinere und senkrechte Bilder einsetzen konnte. Ich war bestürzt. Er hatte schon bei der Vorbesprechung eine Äusserung gemacht, die, wie man nachträglich sehen konnte, in diese Richtung ging und die ich korrigiert hatte. Als ich nun sagte, jetzt sei es ja wie ein Abreisskalender, sagte er mit grosser Evidenz: "Ja, das war doch auch die Absicht.!" Ich überlegte nun, wie man das rückgängig machen könnte. Eine Möglichkeit war, einen neuen Raster zu kaufen. Aber ich wusste nicht mehr, wo er her war , und es wäre langwierig und mühsam gewesen, ihn zu suchen. Die andere Möglichkeit war, die auseinandergeschnittenen Teile wieder in der alten Form zusammenzulegen und neu zu kopieren. Im Gedanken, dass dies die bessere Möglichkeit sei, und im Begriff, ihn das machen zu lassen, erwachte ich. (189 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2541 (1993-02-22 - Zürich)Ich war irgendwo in einer grossen amerikanischen Stadt und wartete auf die Abreise. Dann traf ich Bille und Martin und war froh darüber, dass wir zusammen abreisen konnten. Wir waren in dem Hotel und zwar ganz oben, auf einer Terrasse, die zugleich wie eine Strasse war. Das Hotel lag offenbar an einem Hang, der ein so grosses Gefälle hatte, dass auch die oberste Etage, obwohl es ein Hochhaus war, noch an den Hang grenzte. Man konnte unten am Rande der Stadt das Wasser durch die Häuser scheinen sehen. - Plötzlich waren Bille und Martin weg. Ich konnte sie nicht finden, obwohl ich die ganze Terrasse absuchte. Ich ging einige Treppenstufen herab, sah dann aber, dass das bei der Grösse der Entfernungen keinen Sinn hatte, und suchte einen Aufzug, der mich ins Hotelzimmer herabführen sollte, wo meine Sachen schon gepackt waren. Ich hatte keine Ahnung, wie ich den Weg zum Bahnhof finden sollte. Auch wurde die Zeit bis zur Abfahrt des Zuges schon sehr knapp. Ich schaute nach meiner goldenen Uhr, die merkwürdig schnell und, wie mir schien, unregelmässig tickte und so, als ob man ihren Herzschlag spüren könnte. Sie war wie lebendig. Man spürte ihren Herzschlag an der Oberfläche wie einen Puls aber als Ausbeulung auf diese Oberfläche. Dann war aber wieder alles mit ihr in Ordnung. Ich erwachte, weil ich offenbar irgendwie gejammert hatte und Emme sagte besorgt: "Was ist?" Ich sagte.:"Traum". Sie sagte: "Ach je!" Das war aber schon im Wachen und ich war froh, dass Emme da war.

Dann noch zweimal eingenickt mit ähnlich dramatischem Traumende. Einmal wurde die Landschaft oder Gegend, in der ich stand, langsam verschleiert, dann war es mit einem Ruck rabenschwarz, völlige Finsternis, wie wenn das Licht abgeschaltet wird oder in einer Spiegelreflexkamera bei Langzeitbelichtung der weggeklappte Spiegel den Durchblick verhindert und man nur schwarz sieht. Gleichzeitig höre ich ein laut brummendes Geräusch und höre noch im Erwachen, dass ich dies als einen Rachenlaut selbst erzeugt habe, und erwache mit starkem Herzklopfen. (122 words)

Mir wurde die meine überreicht mit der Bemerkung: "Sie können erst am Montag beginnen. Sie werden gebüsst, weil Sie sich nicht richtig verhalten haben." Ich war empört und sagte: "Das weise ich zurück. Das erkenne ich nicht an. Ich wünsche dass Sie das zur Kenntnis nehmen."

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2549 (1993-03-01 - Zürich)Ich hielt im Traum eine Vorlesung über den Traum. Es war eine Vorlesung in der Aula wie bei der Abschiedsvorlesung, aber zugleich auch noch etwas wie ein Seminar an anderem Ort - wohl im Hörsaal 101, in das ich während der Sache geriet. Ich hatte aber ein Mikrophon um, sodass man mich in der Aula auch noch hören musste. Irgendwann sagte ich:" Ich möchte jetzt noch einmal in die Aula zurückgehen" und tat dies auch. Während die Aula am Anfang sehr voll gewesen war, war sie aber jetzt viel lehrer (Fehlleistung statt: leerer), weil die Menschen, als ich hinausgegangen war, offenbar auch hinausgegangen waren. Es war aber immer noch eine Schar von Hörern da, zu der ich jetzt sprach. Ich stellte die Frage, ob eigentlich ein Traum ein Thema hat, wie zum Beispiel "Der Getrappeltraum". Ich sagte: Während er geträumt wird, hat der Traum natürlich kein Thema, denn da ist er ja die Welt. Und unser Leben im Wachen hat ja auch kein Thema. Aber dann, wenn wir daraus aufwachen, geben wir ihm vielleicht ein Thema und besonders, wenn er gedeutet oder bedeutsam wird, geben wir ihm ein Thema, indem wir ihn durch das bezeichnen, was in ihm für die Deutung wichtig oder massgebend ist. Mit diesem Gedanken beendigte ich die Vorlesung. (212 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2550 (1993-03-02 - Zürich)Ich hatte irgendwo gesundbeterische Dinge gegen meine Rückenschmerzen gekauft. So hatte ich eine Maske auf dem Kopf, die ähnlich aussah wie eine Gasmaske, und irgendeine Art Röntgenlampe an mir, die bewirkte, dass meine Wirbelsäule riesengross und leuchtend an die Wand projiziert wurde. Als ich mich dann bewegte und ging , sah man die Wirbelsäule entsprechend schwanken und sich bewegen. Es sah sehr unheimlich aus. Emme war währenddessen damit beschäftigt, etwas anderes aus dieser Serie von gekauften Gegenständen zu präparieren, was sich "Der Mond" nannte. Sie musste dazu eine Flüssigkeit anrühren und diesen Gegenstand hineintun. Der fiel dann aber herunter und war kaputt und Emme sagte: "O je, jetzt ist der Mond kaputt" Ich fand das aber nicht schlimm, weil mir die ganzen Utensilien sehr gesundbeterisch vorkamen. - Ausserdem hatte ich noch einen grossen dunklen Schrank gekauft, um mehr Platzt für meine Sachen zu haben. Nun war aber die Frage, wo wir ihn hinstellen sollten. Wir hatten ein neues Zimmer zusätzlich bekommen. Es war gross und geräumig und durch eine Zwischentür mit dem bisherigen verbunden. Da hätte man den Schrank zwar hineinstellen können, aber dann hätte es seine Grosszügigkeit wieder verloren. Ich sagte: "Ich glaube, das tun wir nicht". Und aus der Tatsache, dass Emme mir da nicht widersprach, sah ich, dass sie das auch dachte. Ich überlegte nun, wie ich den Schrank am besten zurückgeben könne und erwachte. (228 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2551 (1993-03-03 - Zürich)Eine sehr grosszügig eingerichtete moderne Wohnung, eigentlich eine Luxuswohnung, mit zwei Badezimmern, jedes von beiden ein ganzer quadratischer Raum, der mit der Wanne identisch ist, einer von beiden mit einem kleinen Felsen in der Mitte, der andere mehr wie eine glatte grosse Badewanne, aber beide sehr flach, sodass das Wasser bald über die Ränder laufen und die Wohnung überschwemmen muss, so dass man nur wenig wird hineinlassen dürfen. Dann eine Art Party mit lauter schönen jungen Mädchen, die man zur Begrüssung auf den Mund oder auf die Hand küsst. Ich bin für sie so eine Art Senior und es ist eine sehr elegante "grosse weite Welt". ich fühle mich aber wohl da. Es ist vielleicht die Welt eines der Kinder. (120 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2552 (1993-03-05 - Zürich)Ich schreibe auf den Computer etwas wie die Geschichte eines Ortes, die sehr intensive Strecken hat und dramatische, wie zum Beispiel Kriege, aber auch wieder ruhige und breit fliessende. Es sind aber nicht eigentlich Inhalte, was ich schreibe, sondern eher Kräfte, Dynamik, Intensitäten. Es ist, als ob diese selber ablaufen und man sie nur gleichsam begleitet, als ob das Geschehen, nicht als Inhalt, sondern als Kraft, selbst gegenwärtig ist. Bestimmte Abschnitte des Geschehens, oder Stränge davon, sind auch wie essbar. Es sind Energien, manches ist auch wie heilig. Ich bin auf jeden Fall sehr ergriffen von dem Geschehen oder fasziniert. Es ist schwer fassbar oder beschreibbar, weil es die Dynamik des Geschehens selber ist, nicht der Inhalt, aber etwas wie seine Innenseite. Es sind die Kräfte, die dabei auch im Computer selber ablaufen. (133 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2553 (1993-03-07 - Zürich)Besonders intelligente grosse Vögel, die sogar lernen, den Kronleuchter an zu machen. Ich sitze im Zimmer und beobachte sie. Sie bewegen sich ganz selbstverständlich in diesem Zimmer. Sie sind etwa so gross wie grosse Adler. Den Kronleuchter können sie durch Druck auf einen Knopf im Zimmer anmachen. Ein etwas kleinerer Vogel anderer Art gerät dazwischen Er ist sehr unruhig. Ich lasse ihn zur Tür heraus. Es ist eine grosse Glastür, die ins Freie führt. - Vorher andere Szene, in der es um den Kauf eines Weihnachtsbaumes geht. Emme hat einen sehr grossen ausgewählt, mit weiten Zweigen, die in einem gewissen Abstand voneinander stehen, so dass der Baum sich zu einem sehr harmonischen Gebilde entfaltet. Ich bewache ihn, während Emme in dem grossen kaufhausartigen Geschäft einen Verkäufer sucht. Der, den sie findet, bringt dann einen anderen ,noch grösseren, aber gleich teuren Baum, der ihm offenbar noch besser gefällt, während ich den ersten schöner finde. Emme sagt mir leise ins Ohr: Ich finde aber unseren, das ist der erste, den sie ausgesucht hat, viel schöner. Ich freue mich, dass sie es ebenso beurteilt wie ich. Auch diese sehr grossen Bäume passen offenbar in unsere Wohnung, die sehr hohe Räume hat. So ist auch der Raum in der folgenden Szene mit den Vögeln sehr hoch. Der Kronleuchter, den sie anzünden, ist sehr gross und feierlich, aber elegant, wie ein Empirekronleuchter. Ich bin von den intelligenten Vögeln, die bald sind wie Hausgenossen, sehr fasziniert.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2554 (1993-03-07 - Zürich)Ich halte einen Stier, der mich attackiert, bei den Hörnern. Doch wird dies immer schwieriger, weil seine Kräfte sehr gross sind, obwohl er noch klein und jung ist. Ich hatte ihn zunächst nicht als solchen erkannt, als er in den Raum hereinkam, und hatte ihn im Scherz gereizt. Seine Hörner kommen jetzt immer näher an mein Gesicht und drohen mich zu verletzen. Jemand gibt mir Ratschläge, wie ich vorgehen soll, kann aber selber nichts tun. Ich bin dann wohl allmählich aufgewacht. (81 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2555 (1993-03-08 - Zürich)Herr von Vieregge-Steinhausen hat mich eingeladen. Ausgesprochen hat die Einladung seine Frau. Er war hier in dem Traum Professor und hatte ein Seminar abgehalten, das letzte des Semesters. Man ging langsam zum Raum heraus. Es war auch wie bei einem Kongress. Ich überlegte, wie ich mich anschliessen sollte, weil die Einladung für heute abend, also direkt im Anschluss an das Seminar war. Frau von Vieregge war dann weg, aber direkt vor der Tür war er beschäftigt, zusammen mit einem Hauswart Tische weg zu tragen. Ich griff mit zu. Es war ein ganz leichter Beistelltisch, den wir so zu dritt in der Hand hatten. Ich sagte: "Den kann ich auch ganz leicht allein tragen" und sie liessen ihn los und sagten, in welchen Raum er gehöre. Es war ein altes schlossartiges Gebäude mit hohen quadratähnlichen Räumen wie mache Barockschlösser. Ich fand den Raum. Er war möbliert wie ein Theaterraum mit einigen Tischen und Ähnlichem, die teils etwas mit Farbe bekleckert waren ,wie improvisierte Bühnenrequsiten. Ich überlegte, wo der Tisch hingehöre oder am passendsten stehen könne, und fand einen Platz, der so aussah, wo ich ihn abstellte. In diesem Augenblick kam Herr von Vieregge mit einem Glas hinein, das irgend etwas Alkoholisches enthielt, prostete mir zu, indem er "Hei Hei" sagte, und trank. Ich sagte: "Ich danke Ihnen sehr für die Einladung heute abend, ich weiss garnicht, ob Sie wissen, dass Sie mich eingeladen haben. Ihre Frau hat die Einladung ausgesprochen." Aus seiner Antwort sah man, dass er es wirklich nicht wusste und auch den Scherz nicht verstanden hatte. Er sagte, sich auf das Seminar beziehend, in dem am Schluss über eine Autorin namens Doris sowieso gesprochen worden war: "Ja ,es war nett, über die Doris zu sprechen zum Abschied - womit er das Semesterende meinte - sie hat es bitter nötig." Er meinte damit, dass es für ihre Karriere sehr gut sei. In diesem Augenblick hatte er auch Ähnlichkeit mit Gadamer. - Ich wusste nun nicht, wie ich mich verhalten sollte, weil er ja offensichtlich nicht wusste, dass ich heute abend sein Gast war, und ich es doch nicht gut noch ein zweites mal sagen konnte. Wenn ich nun bei ihm in dem Raum blieb, wusste er nicht, warum, und wir wären in Verlegenheit geraten. Wenn ich aber rausgegangen wäre, wäre es auch nicht richtig gewesen, weil ich ja sein und seiner Frau Gast war, was hinterher herausgekommen wäre. In diesem Dilemma wachte ich mit einem Seufzer auf, den ich im Erwachen noch als realen Seufzer hörte. (416 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2556 (1993-03-09 - Zürich)Ich bin mit jemand zusammen, der eine Anwaltspraxis hat - es war vielleicht mein Bruder aber es kann auch Belli gewesen sein, oder jemand anders -. Das Zimmer ist schon ganz von Klienten gefüllt. Ich sage zu der anderen Person, ob ich versuchen soll, die Leute nach ihren Anliegen schon mal etwas zu ordnen, während sie noch etwas anderes erledigen muss. Sie sagt noch im Herausgehen: "Ja, das ist eine gute Idee". Also beginne ich damit, indem ich die Leute anrede und etwa sage:" Ich bin nur der Bruder und ich bin nicht Jurist, aber ich könnte, wenn Sie wollen, bei jedem schon einmal aufschreiben, worum es geht. Ich selbst bin Psychologe, Psychologieprofessor." Davon schienen die Leute beeindruckt und waren einverstanden.Ich musste nun feststellen, welche die Klienten waren und welche die Begleitpersonen, und überlegte, wie ich die Niederschriften auf dem Papier anordnen sollte. Dann andere Szene: Emme und ich sassen mit all den vielen Leuten in dem Raum beim Essen. Emme sagte etwas zu mir wie "Wie schade", als das Essen verteilt und Suppe aus einem Krug eingegossen wurde, und meinte damit: Wie schade um unsere Ruhe und unser gemütliches Essen. Es war eine Situation, wie wenn unerwarteter Besuch kommt, der einem eigentlich zu viel ist, zu dem man aber freundlich sein muss. (213 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2557 (1993-03-10 - Zürich)Traum:Am Computer war eine Einrichtung mit zwei herausragenden stangenartigen Gebilden zum Einschieben von Druckerschwärze oder ähnlichem. Eine davon war lose oder nicht richtig eingerastet. Ich versuchte, sie hineinzudrücken, was erst Schwierigkeiten machte, dann aber so gelang, dass die ganze Einrichtung einrastete. Jetzt begann sogleich ein umwälzendes Geräusch. Es schien ein Mechanismus in Gang gesetzt zu sein, der wohl dazu diente, eine neue Kassette Druckerschwärze oder Papier einzuführen, jetzt aber die schon eingeführte, bestehende umwälzte. Dampf begann aus ihr aufzusteigen. Ich sah, dass ich den falschen Prozess sofort unterbrechen musste, und versuchte die Kuppelung der Verlängerungsschnur am Boden zu finden, um den Stecker rauszuziehen. Nach kurzem Suchen fand ich sie am Boden und trennte die Stecker, die schon ganz heiss waren, wie nach einer Überlastung. Ich war sehr besorgt, ob im Computer etwas kaputt sein könne und erwachte mir diesem Sorgengefühl. (140 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2559 (1993-03-11 - Zürich)Wir, Emme und ich, waren bei einem Fest oder einer Veranstaltung gewesen. Für die Rückfahrt hatte mir jemand seinen Oldtimer geliehen. Es war ein sehr altes, sehr schönes rotes Auto, bei dem die Formen noch rund waren, so der Kühler zylinderförmig gewölbt, aber sehr elegant. Es war ein offenes Auto. Zu meiner Verwunderung konnte ich gut damit umgehen, obwohl ich doch lange nicht gefahren bin. An einer Stelle ging aber doch fast etwas schief: Ein anderes Auto, auch ein Oldtimer, grösser und von grauer Farbe, kam an uns vorbei. Es war auch ein offener Wagen und darin sass als Mitgenommener Herr Sandor, der auch mit uns gemeinsam zu dem Fest gegangen war. Ich winkte ihm zu und passte dabei nicht richtig auf, sodass sich unser eigenes Auto einmal um die eigene Achse drehte, das heisst erst nach hinten, dann wieder nach vorne guckte. Es passierte aber nichts, obwohl wir dabei fast das andere Auto gestreift hätten. Dann hatten wir irgendwo angehalten, und Emme war kurz weggegangen. Ich hatte das Auto an den Strassenrand gesteuert. Es war eine altmodische Landstrasse, wo man am Rand neben einem Baum- und Gebüschstreifen stehen konnte. Mehrere Vorbeifahrende riefen mir zu, ob sie helfen sollten, weil sie dachten, ich hätte eine Panne. Ich antwortete Ihnen, dass ich hier nur auf jemand warte. Dann kam Emme wieder, in Begleitung von mehreren Personen, die mitgenommen werden wollten Von einer davon sagte Emme: "Hier ist jemand, den nicht Du, sondern die Dich unterrichtet hat". Es war eine junge Frau, die ich nicht erkannte. Ich überlegte, ob sie mich zum Beispiel irgendwann beim Rheumaturnen unterrichtet haben könne. Wir waren mit denen,die mitgenommen werden wollten, jetzt fünf und ich sagte, das würde wohl gehen, wenn hinten drei sitzen würden, und sagte dann zu Emme: Du kannst ja vorne neben mir sitzen. Inzwischen kletterte ein kleiner Junge vorne auf den Führersitz. Es war ein brauner Junge, wohl ein Mischling. Er war über den Einschnitt hereingestiegen, den das sehr sportliche alte Auto statt einer Tür hatte. Ich sagte: Aber der Junge gehört nicht dazu. Eine der Frauen sagte : "Doch". Es war offenbar ihr Kind oder Adoptivkind. Nun wurde es problematisch, denn so wären es statt der fünf Personen ja sechs in dem sehr schmalen, alten und nur geliehenen Auto gewesen. Ich befürchtete, dass es dann Schwierigkeiten geben würde, wenn wir in eine Kontrolle kämen und wir dann wegen Überladen angezeigt werden würden, was bei dem nur geliehenen Auto problematisch wäre. Ich dachte nach , wie ich dies nun am besten sagen sollte und erwachte dabei. Dann dauerte es wieder - wie oft - eine ganze Zeit, bis ich begriff, dass dies ein aufzuschreibender Traum gewesen war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2560 (1993-03-12 - Zürich)Emme und ich waren irgendwohin zum Essen gegangen. Wir hatten einen gemütlichen Platz belegt, wo man mit dem Rücken zur Wand und in der Ecke sitzt. Emme war schon gegangen, um das Essen zu holen, während ich noch dabei war, das Belegen zu Ende zu führen. Da kam eine betriebsame alte Frau mit dauergewellten und mit einem Blauschimmer überfärbten weissen Haaren und legte etwas genau auf den Platz, den ich belegt hatte. Als sie merkte, dass ich da war, begann sie zu lamentieren, sie habe jetzt das schöne Schweinefleisch und wolle auch den schönen Platz. Man merkte, dass sie hoffte, ihr Alter einzusetzen, um andere zu vertreiben. Ich sagte wütend: "Ich bin auch alt, ich bin 67. Ich bezweifle, dass sie überhaupt älter sind als ich", denn bei näherer Betrachtung wirkte sie eigentlich jünger. Sie hörte aber nicht auf, zu lamentieren. Ich sagte: "Haben Sie denn nicht gesehen, dass der Platz belegt ist?". Sie sagte : "Doch, aber ich dachte, das kann man ja ändern". Da wurde ich noch wütender und nahm mein Zeug da weg, entfernte mich und sagte wütend: "Gehen Sie, verdammt noch mal gehen Sie", wobei ich ihr den Platz überliess. Nun musste ich für Emme und mich einen anderen Platz suchen, der auch zu finden war, aber weniger gemütlich, ärgerte mich, dass ich nachgegeben hatte und wachte sehr verärgert auf mit dem Gefühl: Aber den Traum, den schreib ich jetzt wirklich nicht auf, der ist zu blöd.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2565 (1993-03-16 - Zürich)Eine Art Religionsgemeinschaft mit dem Hintergrund der Jungschen Psychologie. Man machte eine Art Meditationsübungen, bei denen man zu Sachen fähig war, die man sonst nicht konnte. So drehten wir eine sonst unelastische lange Vierkantstange so um die eigene Achse, dass sie zu einer Schraube wurde, so wie man ein gespanntes Band so lange drehen kann, bis es eine feste schraubenartige Stange wird. Man musste diese Drehung ganz gleichmässig und konzentriert vornehmen, damit die Stange nicht sprang, was gefährlich gewesen wäre, weil die Teile dann so durch den Raum geflogen wären, dass sie jemand hätten verletzen können. Ein Mann, der wohl diese Meditationsübungen ablehnte, kam herein und machte jäh das Licht an, denn es war inzwischen dunkel dämmerig geworden. Wir mussten aufpassen, durch das jähe Licht nicht erschreckt zu werden, denn dann hätte die Stange springen können. Wir konnten das aber vermeiden. Es war lustvoll, so sich selbst und die Materie beherrschen zu können. Dann war da ein Klassentreffen, bei dem drei Detlevs zusammen waren, nämlich Detlef Hollmann und ich und noch ein dritter Detlev, den ich eigentlich von der Schulzeit her nicht erinnerte. Als wir danach nach Hause gingen - es war eine ziemlich grosse Menschenmenge, mehr als eine Schulklasse - und unsere Mäntel von den Kleiderhaken nahmen, wie nach einem Konzert oder ähnlichem, wo die Menge hinausgeht, traf ich wieder Detlef Hollmann, der sagte, dass ich mit ihm fahren könne in seinem Auto. Ich sagte, dass ich mich garnicht daran erinnern könne, dass der dritte Detlev auch in der Klasse gewesen sei. Er sagte, dieser sei ganz zum Schluss noch dabei gewesen. (263 words)

Ich muss die Noten in der Eile irgendwie verschoben abgeschrieben haben, so dass man sie so nicht spielen kann. Die Abschrift geschah auch sehr unter Zeitdruck. Aber es scheint auch sonst noch bei der Aufführung der Stücke des Komponisten, um den es sich handelt und der wohl einen Jahrestag hat, Schwierigkeiten zu geben. Es scheint, als ob seine Musik unterdrückt wird, weil er dem Regime missliebig ist, etwa so wie jüdische Komponisten, etwa Mendelsohn, in der Nazizeit. (122 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2567 (1993-03-17 - Zürich)Martin bekam ein Baby. Er trug das Kind sozusagen statt Bille aus.

Ich sagte: Gehst Du in die selbe Klinik, in der Bille war? Er sagte: Ich denke an Hirslanden. Ich sagte: Die haben ja auch eine Frauenstation - und fügte dann hinzu: Aber Du musst ja in eine andere Station gehen. Er sagte: Ich kann wählen. Sie hatten ihm das offenbar freigestellt. Ich stellte mir vor, wie er neben den Müttern das Baby kriegen würde, wenn er in die Frauenstation gehen würde. Erst jetzt wurde mir deutlich, dass er das Baby ja garnicht auf normalem Wege zur Welt bringen könne und dass hier sicher ein Kaiserschnitt notwendig wäre. Bei dieser Überlegung erwachte ich langsam.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2577 (1993-03-24 - Zürich)Ich war in einer Wohnung. Es ertönte Barockmusik. Es war eine Kantate. Gleichzeitig waren es auch Bilder von einem Maler namens E.Strang - man sah seinen Namen handschriftlich darunter - Die Bilder waren im Stil der dreissiger und vierziger Jahre, aber gleichzeitig auch altertümlich. Die Musik ertönte sozusagen in den Bildern. Die Kantate hatte auch einen Begleittext, der erläuternd dazwischen gesprochen wurde.So hiess es am Schluss, dass jetzt eine Version des Schlusses komme, die ganz anders sei, gleichsam nicht für die Leute. Jetzt klang die Musik sehr ergreifend, auch unheimlich und dunkel, während sie zuvor eher hell und strahlend war. Es war eine Musik von feierlichem Rhythmus, der irgendwie nach dem Erwachen noch da ist, noch nachklingt, auch wie fern hörbare Töne. Es war ein sehr schöner Traum. Vorher waren auch Bilder da, die ein Mädchen gemalt hatte. Eines hatte eine Unterschrift, dass es hellen Sommermittag darstelle. Es war aber eigentlich auch dunkel wie die Nacht - gleichsam dunkel vor Helligkeit, sodass man den heissen Sommermittag spürte. Die Wohnung und ihre Räume spielten auch eine Rolle. Gleichzeitig war es auch ein Stück der Kindheit in Schwerin. Andere Kinder oder Jugendliche aus der Nachbarschaft waren da. Aber es war auch jetzt. So redete ich mit Emme. Ich sollte in irgend einen Nachbarraum kommen ,wo ich mich um ein Kind oder um ein Tier kümmern musste, hatte aber in diesem Raum, wo ich jetzt war, noch zu tun und sagte, ich wolle das schnell fertig machen, es ginge ja doch nicht anders. Es ging dabei auch um Essen, das sehr feierlich war und auch irgendwie mit der Musik verbunden. (267 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2579 (1993-03-25 - Zürich)Wir hatten einen grossen und hohen Haufen Sand auf dem Balkon, mit dem wir irgend etwas machen wollten. Emme und ich waren im Mittelzimmer, dessen Tür wir geschlossen hatten, und erledigten verschiedene Dinge. Emme schrieb, glaube ich, auf dem Computer. Inzwischen waren viele Jugendliche in der Wohnung. Später ging ich hinaus ins Wohnzimmer und sah dort einen Landstreicher stehen, der ein Butterbrot ass, das er aus einem Papier ausgewickelt hatte. Ich wollte zurückgehen ins Mittelzimmer, dachte dann aber doch, dass man den Landstreicher wegschicken müsste. Er war nicht mehr da, konnte nur über den Balkon hinausgegangen sein. Ich ging auf diesen hinaus und sah den Landstreicher noch unten auf der Wiese sich entfernen. Er musste über das Balkongitter geklettert und hinuntergesprungen sein. Der Sandhaufen war flacher getrampelt. man sah die Spurten vieler grösserer und kleinerer Schuhe und Füsse darauf. Das mussten die Jugendlichen gemacht haben. Ein grösserer Teil des Sandes war dabei zur Seite gedrückt und über den Balkon auf die Wiese vor den Unterbewohnern herabgerieselt, wo er einen neuen Haufen gebildet hatte, der hochgewachsen und mit dem auf dem Balkon zusammengewachsen war, so dass es aussah wie geschmolzenes und herabgeflossenes Wachs. Es würde viel Arbeit machen, den ganzen Sand wieder von unten hoch zu bringen, und war auch ärgerlich gegenüber den Unterbewohnern. Ich wollte Emme holen und es ihr zeigen. In diesem Moment klingelte es und Emme sagte "Klönkes kommen" und öffnete die Tür. Es war ein junges Paar, von dem Emme schon vorher gesprochen hatte. Ich hörte nun Emme zu der jungen Frau sagen:"Ja, kann man denn das, die Zehnägel schwarz machen?" Die Frau antwortete etwas des Sinnes, dass das jetzt Mode sei. Ich ging schnell durch den Gang ins Mittelzimmer, weil ich noch nicht angezogen war, und sagte: "Ich muss mich erst anziehen." Ich war sehr gespannt auf die schwarzen Zehnägel und die dazu gehörige Frau. (309 words)

Sie gesellte sich in wunderbar zwangloser Art zu mir und schlenderte durch den Abend neben mir her. Ich hatte einen kleinen sehr schön gearbeiteten Holzstuhl in der Hand, den mir gerade jemand gegeben hatte und den ich nicht absetzte um die wunderbare Selbstverständlichkeit unseres Zusammengehens und unserer Berührung nicht zu unterbrechen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2582 (1993-03-27 - Zürich)"Macht nichts, wenn langsam sich dahinwinkt. Kann noch Pentakstern!". Diesen Satz sagte eine russische Verkehrspolizistin zu mir auf einer breiten Strasse oder Brücke in einer grösseren Stadt. Ich antwortete: "Ein bisschen weit". Sie lachte und wiederholte: "Ein bisschen weit" Gemeint war das Pentagon, das amerikanische Verteidigungsministerium. Der Ausdruck "Pentakstern"dafür schien mir im Traum ganz normal. Die Situation war folgende: Ich sass auf einem kleinen Rollwagen, einem Brett mit vier Rädern darunter, das flach am Boden der Strasse war, und bewegte mich vorwärts, indem ich mich mit den Händen auf der Strasse weiter stiess. Mit diesem Fahrzeug bewegte ich mich im normalen Strassenverkehr, der freilich hier im russischen Machtbereich nicht sehr dicht war. Auf der Brücke oder breiten Strasse, stranden vier Verkehrspolizisten zusammen, zwei Paare hintereinander, wobei nicht nur die Paare unter sich alle Bewegungen synchron machten, sondern auch jeweils beide hintereinander stehende Paare miteinander. Es waren also vier Personen, die das machten, war normalerweise ein Mensch allein machen würde Und weil sie zu viert alle Bewegungen aufeinander abstimmen mussten, machten sie es langsam und mit grossen Pausen, zum Beispiel zwischen der Freigabe des Querverkehrs und des Längsverkehrs. Sie standen da, wo die Brücke mündet und eine andere Strasse kreuzt. Sie waren eine Art Militärpolizei und die ganze Anordnung wirkte so, als ob sie für einen riesigen Verkehrsstrom aufgestellt sei, oder für den Durchmarsch grosser militärischer Kolonnen. Sie waren dabei aber sehr vergnügt und wirkten nicht besonders militärisch. Ich weiss nicht, welche Stadt es war, wohl eine Stadt in Deutschland. Voraufgegangen waren andere Traumszenen, die ich nur sehr bruchstückhaft und in Spuren erinnere. Es ging darum, ob wir hier oder wo anders wohnen wollten, wobei viele verschiedene Gesichtspunkte zu berücksichtigen waren. Mein Fortbewegungsmittel schien mir im Traum ganz normal, obwohl mir seine Andersartigkeit und Langsamkeit zwischen den Autos bewusst war. Aber auch diese waren anders und langsamer als heute, wie russische Militärfahrzeuge während des zweiten Weltkrieges oder in der Besatzungszeit danach. Die Anspielung an das Pentagon zeigt aber, dass es die Gegenwartssituation war. Mit dem Satz:"Wenn sich langsam dahinwinkt", meinte die Polizistin die Art meiner Fortbewegung mit den Händen., mit dem Satz "Kann noch Pentakstern" meinte sie, dass ich trotz der Langsamkeit dieser Fortbewegung auf diese Weise doch mit der Zeit noch bis zum Pentagon in Amerika kommen könne.

Um in die Räumlichkeiten zu gelangen, die voller Menschen sind, oder herauszukommen, muss man sich durch ein enges Loch zwängen. Ich habe Angst, darin stecken zu bleiben, besonders gegen Ende des Traums. Ich muss eine Frau, die sich sozusagen in das Loch gesetzt hat, erst wegziehen, wozu man auch schon Energie braucht, weil auch sie dabei schon etwas mit ihrer Sitzfläche darin eingeklemmt ist, und habe nun besonders Angst bei der Vorstellung, da durch zu müssen. Es ist ein viereckiges Loch, gleichsam ein Ausschnitt in einer Mauer. Diesmal geht es für mich darum, herauszukommen. (107 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2585 (1993-03-31 - Zürich)Ich hatte irgendwo einen Vortrag gehalten. Nun sagte der Veranstalter oder Diskussionsleiter - es kann auch eine Frau gewesen sein - hinterher zu den Leuten, dass ich jetzt in der und der Strasse, das war in einer anderen Institution, noch heute einen Vortrag halten würde über Spiel und Spielzeug. In diesem Moment fiel mir ein, dass ich das ganz vergessen hatte. Ich hatte diesen Vortrag vor langem ausgemacht, aber vergessen es in meinen Treminkalender zu schreiben. Jetzt blieb mir nur noch ganz wenig Zeit bis dahin. Aber es fiel mir sofort ein, dass ich zum Beispiel über "Spiel und der spielende Mensch, homo ludens", und über "Zeug und Zeugszusammenhang", im Sinne Heideggers, reden könne - Ich merke jetzt im Wachen, dass das in der Tat ein ausserordentlich interessanter Ansatz ist. Ich suchte also ein weisses Blatt Papier, um diese Stichworte und andere drauf zu schreiben. Dabei war jetzt, obwohl noch im Vortragssaal des eben vergangenen anderen Vortrags, die Situation so, wie wenn ich auf meinem Bett läge in der Nacht und das Schreibpapier neben dem Bett habe und danach die Hände ausstrecke. Nun erwischte ich aber immer schon beschriebene Blätter, einige von denen fielen dabei auch hinab, was insofern kritisch war, als ich - wohl am Abend vorher - einige Papiere, die wegzuwerfen waren, neben meinem Bettt auf den Fussboden geworfen hatte, wie ich es oft tue. Ich musste also aufpassen, dass beide sich nicht vermischten. Doch das kam später. Jetzt ging es um den unmittelbar bevorstehenden Vortrag über Spiel und Spielzeug und das Aufschreiben der Stichworte. Schliesslich fand ich ein leeres Blatt und schrieb die Worte: "Der spielende Mensch, homo ludens - Zeug und Zeugzusammenhang" darauf. Dabei war ich immer noch in dem Vortragssaal des ersten Vortrags zwischen den Leuten, die zugehört hatten. Diese Situation und die im Bett waren zu einer Einheit verdichtet, ohne dass mir das auffiel. Ich fühlte mich jetzt schon wieder wohl und merkte, dass es einen guten Vortrag gaben könne und erwachte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2586 (1993-04-01 - Zürich)Wir treffen Tobias im Garten eines offenbar unterirdischen Museums. Er hat eine besondere Vorliebe zu grossen auf der Strasse vorbeidonnernden Lastzügen, die für ihn eine mütterliche Qualität haben und an die er sich, wenn sie stehen, kuschelt. Emme kennt diese Vorliebe bei ihm schon von früher her. Eine alte Frau ist auch da, die ihn streicheln soll und erklärt kriegt, wie sie das machen soll. Der Eingang des Museums, zu dem man herabsteigen muss, ist in dem Garten. (78 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2587 (1993-04-01 - Zürich)beim kurzen Einnicken in der Badewanne: "Süsses, Christine" . Diese Worte sagte eine Stimme - ich weiss nicht, ob die eigene oder eine fremde, dann wachte ich wieder auf. Die Worte waren als Anrede an diese Christine gemeint, die dabei als "Süsses"bezeichnet wurde, gleichsam als Kosename, wie süsses Baby oder süsses Kind. (52 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2588 (1993-04-02 - Zürich)Wir fahren im Lastwagen den Berg hinunter, Emme am Steuer, ich daneben. Teilweise ist es aber auch mein Bruder, der am Steuer sitzt. Ab und zu und allmählich immer häufiger setzt der Motor aus, sodass der Wagen auf der abschüssigen Strasse ohne Motorbremse ist und dadurch immer schneller wird. Ich sage noch etwas Warnendes, weil es langsam gefährlich wird. Er versucht das Problem zu lösen, indem er in einer ganz scharfen Kurve in einen Seitenweg einbiegt, der nicht asphaltiert, sondern aus dem natürlichen Boden gegraben ist und nicht abschüssig. Der Wagen wird dadurch gebremst, gerät aber an einen Abgrund und kommt mit den linken Rädern vom Weg ab. Wir werden herabgeschleudert und können uns nur noch jeder mit einer Hand festhalten, sodass wir nun über dem Abgrund hängen, der schrecklich tief unter uns hinabgeht. Unten ist wohl auch Wasser zu sehen. Emme - oder mein Bruder- versucht nun, mit der anderen Hand ebenfalls Halt zu gewinnen und sich hochzuziehen. Allmählich gelingt es ihr, mit der andern Hand etwas zu packen und das Bein nach oben zu bewegen, um irgendwo Halt zu bekommen . Ich helfe ihr dabei und schiebe mit, wobei ich selber nur mit einer Hand mich festhaltend mit beiden Beinen und der anderen Hand in der Luft hänge und versuche, sie hochzuschieben. Sie kann das eine Bein irgendwo einhaken, an einem Gegenstand wie einem ebenfalls an etwas hängenden Kleiderbügel. Man merkt aber , dass die Gefahr besteht, dass dieser sich löst. Es ist also wichtig, dass wir mit der einen Hand uns ganz sicher festhalten. Bei diesem Bemühen, sie - oder ihn - hochzuschieben, wache ich langsam auf. (270 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2589 (1993-04-02 - Zürich)Bruno Rutishausers Stimme dringt aus meinem Lautsprecher. Ich höre, wie er etwas diktiert oder auch telephoniert. Er hat sein Zimmer unter meinem, aber viele Etagen tiefer im selben Haus. Es muss irgend eine Verbindung zwischen der Leitung, die zu meinem Lautsprecher führt und seiner Schreib- und Telephonanlage entstanden sein. Ich überlege, ob ich ihn anrufen soll und sagen: "Deine Stimme tönt aus meinem Lautsprecher", und erwache. (66 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2590 (1993-04-03 - Zürich)Traum:Ich bin in Wittmoldt. Ich bin irgendwie von aussen an das Haus gekommen bei irgend einer Unternehmung. Ich brauche etwas, ich weiss nicht mehr, was, und überlege, ob ich an die Haustür klopfen und um Hilfe dafür bitten soll, obwohl ich nicht weiss, wer jetzt darin wohnt. Schliesslich klopfe ich an die Tür, die wenig Resonanz gibt, sodass mein Klopfen nur einen leisen Ton erzeugt. Die Tür muss aus einem neuartigen Stoff sein. Es antwortet niemand. Schliesslich drücke ich die Klinke nieder. Die Tür ist offen. Ich gehe herein. Drinnen ist der Raum anders geworden: Eine grosse Diele ist zum Vorraum für verschiedene Eingänge geworden, an denen Namensschilder zu sein scheinen. Der Raum ist sonst leer, aber durch eine grosse Filetgardine vor den der Tür gegenüberliegenden Fenstern abgeschlossen. Der Boden ist gepflastert. Es ist ein sehr altes Gutshaus, das mir vertraut vorkommt, sodass ich die alte, von früher vertraute Topographie noch wiedererkennen kann. Diese ist zwar ganz anders, als es in dem wohl im vorigen Jahrhundert gebauten Wittmoldter Haus wirklich ist. Das ist aber im Traum nicht so, sondern dort ist es das Haus, an das ich mich erinnere, das heisst das Haus im Traum war, vom Wachen her gesehen, eine Verdichtung von Wittmoldt und Roggow und anderen alten Gutshäusern. Ich bin eigenartig berührt von dieser fernen Erinnerung, die gleichsam in der Topographie wohnt. Ich betrachte die verschiedenen Schilder neben den Türen, oder auch offenen Eingängen, die in Flure führen. Auf den Schildern steht aber nichts, woraus ich etwas entnehmen könnte, keine Namen, sondern irgendetwas anderes. Zum Teil sind es auch alte schon halb abgerissene Schilder. Jetzt betritt ein junger Mann von aussen kommend den Raum, als ich gerade vor einer der Türen linker Hand stehe. Er schaut mich fragend an, spricht mich dann an und sagt: "Wollen Sie eine Tasse Kaffee mit mir trinken? "Er sieht irgendwie der Familie ähnlich, und zwar dem Sohn, der das Gut geerbt hatte in den frühen fünfziger Jahren. Ich sage etwas wie "Ja gerne" und überlege,wie ich nun anfangen soll, und erwache dabei langsam. Der Satz den ich mir noch im Erwachen zurechtlege, lautet etwa."Ich weiss nicht recht, wie ich anfangen soll. Ich war in den vierziger und frühen fünfziger Jahren viel in diesem Haus und weiss jetzt nicht, ob es noch in Beziehung zu der Familie von Bülow steht." (387 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2591 (1993-04-03 - Zürich)Sah - mittags auf der Couch kurz eingenickt - ein Bild das wohl eine Mischung war aus einem Jugendstilbild und dem Bild eines japanischen Zenmeisters, dann eine Handschrift, die zwar eine europäische Handschrift eines Mathematikers war, aber an die Züge der wundervoll gelockerten Schrift eines Zen-meisters aus dem Jahr 1317 erinnerte, die ich vorher in dem Katalog der Zenausstellung von Helmuth Brinker betrachtet hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2593 (1993-04-05 - Zürich)Ich musste mit Hilfe eines Adressenprogramms, das dem glich, das ich im Computer habe, Briefe an die Angehörigen von Leuten schicken, die gestorben oder gefallen waren. Ich versuchte im Computer einen solchen Brief herzustellen, den man dann an alle schicken konnte. Das war sehr schwierig. Dann war ich in einem Hotel, in dem wir, Emme und ich, wohnten, in dem alles computerisiert war mir dem FMP-Programm, zum Beispiel auch die Badezimmer. So war ich in einem Badezimmer, in dem man das Wasser mit Hilfe einer Computerkarte fliessen liess. Ich sass in einem grossen Waschbecken und badete. Offenbar gab es dort keine richtige Badewanne, aber das Becken war so gross, dass man darin sitzen konnte. Dann hatten wir eine Wohnung, in der auch T.W. wohnte (mein Bruder Tessen-Werner). Er war abends nicht zurückgekommen und wir machten uns Sorgen. Dann aber hörte ich ihn kommen, ich ging aus dem Zimmer. Der Flur war noch durch eine Zwischentür in zwei Teile geteilt. Er ging durch den vorderen mit einem Besucher, den er mitgebracht hatte, in ein Zimmer. Deshalb ging ich nicht weiter, um ihn nicht zu stören. (184 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2594 (1993-04-06 - Zürich)Bille sollte ein Stipendium aus Rom bekommen, das ihr eine Professorenfrau vermittelt hatte, über einen Bekannten, den sie in Rom hatte. Es ging um eine Arbeit, bei der offenbar das Familienleben eine Rolle spielte, denn Photos von ihr und dem Kinde in der Wohnung wurden dafür gesammelt, und ausserdem das Aufschreiben von Träumen, denn wir blätterten ein Computerbuch durch, wo ein Programm dafür beschrieben wurde. In dieser Beschreibung spielte ein Zeichen eine Rolle, das in dem Beschreibungstext abgedruckt war. Es waren kleine stilisierte Teddybärenköpfe, die jeweils in verschiedenen Lagen, senkrecht, waagerecht oder schräg gestellt, in dem Text vorkamen. Ich sagte, als die Frau da war: "Das Programm ist übrigens besonders gut zum Traumabschreiben." Der Text war dabei in irgend einem Stadium zusammengedrängt und scheinbar ungeordnet wie in dem Programm "Nur Text", dann aber ordnete sich alles von selbst zu einer sehr passenden Gestaltung, die für die Darstellung der Träume besonders geeignet war. Dann kam das Gespräch auf die Photos, und Frau die sagte besorgt und mit bedenklicher Mine: "Wenn die in Rom aber merken, dass diese Familie im Wohnzimmer schläft!" Das kam ihr besonders schlimm vor. Und sie sagte: "Der Mucki "- oder ähnlich - das war der Herr, der in Rom das Stipendium vermittelt, "schweigt sicher nicht". Ich sagte: "Das sieht man auf den Bildern ja nicht. Es steht ja nicht Wohnzimmer oder Schlafzimmer drauf". Der Zusammenhang, in dem die Frau dieses wissenschaftliche Stipendium vermitteltte, war wohl eine Rolle, die sie in Billes Therapieausbildung hatte. (246 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2595 (1993-04-07 - Zürich)Ich zog mit Jugendlichen durch das Land, die eine Art Revolutionäre waren. Zuletzt gingen wir in ein Pissoir. Ich ging mit ihnen auch dorthin, weil ich ihnen überallhin folgen wollte, fühlte mich aber dabei nicht recht wohl. Dann in einer anderen Szene war ein Mohamedaner da, der mir auf meine Frage die Gebräuche bei einem bestimmten Fest erklären wollte, bei dem man Sachen kaputt macht. Er zeigte mir das an einem meiner kleinen alten Braun-Lautsprecher, wo er mit dem Fingernagel in die schwarze Bespannung Risse hereinritzte, die eine Art Kalender darstellten. Ich liess es zu, weil ich sowieso ein neues Gerät kaufen wollte, verhinderte aber, dass er den zweiten Lautsprecher auch auf diese Weise beschädigte. (115 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2596 (1993-04-10 - Zürich)Andri war hier. Ich lag mit ihm auf dem Boden oder auf einer Couch und er kletterte auf mir rum und lag auch auf mir. Er war schon im Anfang des Sprechenlernens und verstand schon viel, was man sagte. Er konnte auch mit einem bestimmten Laut etwas wie Ja sehr deutlich sagen, wenn man ihn etwas fragte. Auch Martin war da und später in dem Traum auch Bille, deren nackten Bauch ich anfasste, der von dem neuen Baby schon deutlich gewölbt war. Andere Einzelheiten habe ich aber vergessen. Später in der selben Nacht habe ich noch zweimal geträumt ,dass ich diesen Traum im Computer aufgeschrieben hätte, musste aber jedesmal nach dem Erwachen feststellen, dass ich es nicht wirklich getan, sondern nur geträumt hatte, sodass ich ihn jetzt hier sozusagen zum dritten mal aufschreibe.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2597 (1993-04-11 - Zürich)Ging durch eine unbekannte Landschaft, wo man immer wieder grosse vielbefahrene Autostrassen überqueren musste, was nur möglich war, wenn man im Laufschritt zwischen den schnellen Autoströmen die Fahrbahn überquerte. Dabei musste man manchmal auch an Baustellen-Abschrankungen vorbeigehen, was man nur in den kurzen Pausen des Autostroms konnte, gleichsam ständig rückwärtsblickend, ob schon das nächste Auto herannaht,und dann im Laufschritt die Baustellenschranken umrundend. Mehrmals sah ich auch die Spuren von gerade geschehenen Autounfällen mit Leichen, die noch dalagen und denen von dem Unfallgeschehen die Köpfe abgetrennt waren, was besonders grausig war. (90 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2601 (1993-04-13 - Zürich)Fuhr mit einem Fahrzeug, mit dem ich grosse Lasten transportierte und dessen Vorderachse ähnlich wie bei einem Roller oder Fahrrad durch eine senkrechte Stange mit einer weiteren waagerechten Lenkstange verbunden war, mit der man steuerte und auf die man sich dabei stützte. Plötzlich gab diese senkrechte Stange unter mir nach und sank in sich zusammen, sodass das schwer beladenen Fahrzeug bei einer bergaufwärts führenden Strecke stehen blieb und nicht mehr weiterging und ich mit der Lenkstange, die dieses zweispurige Fahrzeug hatte, und auf die ich mich gestützt hatte, sanft nach unten sank. Es war Materialermüdung infolge deren die Stange sich in feines Pulver auflöste. Ich hatte hier ein altes Fahrzeug verwendet, weil ich die Gebrauchsanweisung des neuen, das auch schon vorhanden war, unter dem Zeitdruck, in dem ich vor einem Termin noch Sachen transportieren musste, nicht rechtzeitig genug hatte so lesen können, dass ich schon damit umgehen könnte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2604 (1993-04-15 - Zürich)Ich hatte Sprechstunde in einem grossen querliegenden Raum. Ich rückte, ehe ich hinausging, um den ersten reinzuholen, nochmal den grossen Sherif-Sessel und einen anderen Ledersessel zurecht, damit der Betreffende darauf sitzen könne. Eine Strickjacke und irgend ein anderes Kleidungsstück, die darauf lagen, legte ich zur Seite. Dann ging ich hinaus. Es war aber noch niemand da, sodass ich wieder hineinging. Inzwischen hatte sich eine Tür am anderen Ende des langen querliegenden Raumes geöffnet und Leute gingen durch den Raum und durch eine gegenüberliegende Tür an diesem anderen Ende des Raums wieder hinaus, das heisst, sie durchquerten den Raum dort und redeten dabei laut miteinander. Offenbar hatten sie die angrenzenden Räume und ich überlegte, dass sie so beim Durchgehen und lauten Reden die Sprechstunde stören würden. Überlegte, ob ich es ihnen sagen solle, und beschloss, noch abzuwarten, ob das nicht sowieso vorbei wäre, wenn der erste für die Sprechstunde käme. (149 words)

Es gab einen Preis zu gewinnen, wenn eine Bahnfahrt und eine Busfahrt genau zeitgleich stattfanden. Das war aber irgendwie eigentlich fast nicht möglich. Eine kommentierende Stimme zu den Auto- oder Busfahrten sprach spanisch. Unsere Fahrt mit der Bahn und eine Auto- oder Busfahrt in Spanien erschienen dabei zeitgleich auf dem Bildschirm.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2608 (1993-04-19 - Zürich)Bille, oder jemand Ähnliches, fährt eine kleine Rangierlokomotive, die sich mühsam über alte Schienen quält. Ich sitze bei ihr im Führerstand. Wir kommen auf die Geleise der grossen Eisenbahn. Die Weichen, die dahin führen sind mit Teer zugeschmiert, wie manchmal alte nicht mehr gebrauchte Strassenbahnschienen, die noch daliegen, es sind. Ich merke, dass die kleine Lokomotive in der Lage ist, den Teer aufzusprengen und rate darum, einfach weiterzufahren. Sie tut das und wir gelangen richtig auf die Schienen der grossen Eisenbahn. In diesem Moment nähert sich von hinten auf diesen Schienen ein Zug. Man sieht die Lokomotive, die herannaht, immer grösser werden, woraus man die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sie sich nähert, entnehmen kann. Ich rate Bille, oder wer es ist, jetzt ganz schnell los zu fahren, damit es keinen Zusammenstoss gibt. Sie reagiert jedoch nur zögernd, weil sie die Gefahr nicht erkennt. Ich sage etwas wie :"Gib alles Gas, was Du hast" oder ähnlich - analog für eine Lokomotive. Sie handelt aber sehr langsam und der Zusammenstoss scheint jetzt unvermeidbar. Erwachen. (171 words)

Tante Lu zeigt einzelne Mauerteile und ihre charakteristische Schwingung. Es geht dabei nicht nur um das Haus selbst, sondern auch um neuere Anbauten und das Gelände um das Haus.

Emme, die im Mittelzimmer etwas tut, ruft von dort laut und mahnend "Dellev". Erst jetzt fällt mir ein, dass im Kinderzimmer ja Tobias in seinem Kinderbettchen schläft, der durch die Mozart-Musik geweckt werden kann. Ich mache sie aus, gehe hinaus und schliesse langsam und ganz leise die Tür. Er ist nicht aufgewacht. ich höre noch durch die geschlossene Tür seine langsamen und gleichmässigen Schlafatemzüge. Ich gehe zu Emme ins Mittelzimmer und sage: "Er ist nicht aufgewacht" und erwache und höre im Bett neben mir Emmes langsame und gleichmässige Schlafatemzüge, in denen ich die geträumten Schlafatemzüge von Tobias wiedererkenne.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2615 (1993-04-23 - Zürich)Eine Art Musikfest, wo auch Gisela beteiligt ist. Vorher hatte ich schon in diesem Fest etwas zu tun gehabt, hatte etwas aus der Zeit Karls des Grossen einzubringen, das dann direkt und wirklich da war, gleichsam als Gegenwart dieser Zeit, ähnlich wie eine Handschrift gegenwärtig ist, aber etwas lebendiges, Jetzt Seiendes. Es war wie ein Aufruf Karls des Grossen. Das Jahr 1280 spielte dabei als eine Gegenwart auch eine Rolle. Ich hatte viel zu wenig Zeit zur Vorbereitung, musste dann diese Vergangenheit in ihrer Gegenwart unmittelbar heraufbeschwören. Die Szene mit Gisela kam dann später. Ich sagte zu ihr: "Du siehst müde aus", denn sie sah aus wie jemand, der noch mit dem Schlaf kämpft, fühlte sich aber offenbar völlig wach und war über diese Äusserung irgendwie erstaunt. Ich hatte das Gefühl, meine Äusserung rechtfertigen zu müssen. Sie hatte in dem Traum ein anderes Alter als das der Zwanziger, in dem ich mit ihr zusammen war, war älter, aber nicht so alt, wie wir jetzt in den Sechzigern unseres Lebens wirklich sind. Vielleicht war es auch das höhere Alter, das ich als Müdigkeit wahrnahm. Emme war auch dabei und ich ging mit ihr weiter, hatte auch das Gefühl nicht zu lange bei Gisela verweilen zu dürfen, um Emme nicht zu kränken. Das Merkwürdige an dem Traum ist die Durchdringung der Zeiten, die Gegenwart der Vergangenheit. (224 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2616 (1993-04-24 - Zürich)Ich sass mit Emme im Anhängerwagen einer Srtrassenbahn oder Kleinbahn auf einer ländlichen Strecke. Ich sass vorne im Anhängerwagen, oder war gerade dorthin gegangen, als der Anhänger, in dem wir sassen, in einer Kurve sich vom Vorderwagen löste und sanft stehen blieb, während der Zugwagen weiter fuhr. Die Mitfahrenden hatten es nicht gemerkt. Ich stieg aus und sah, dass der Wagen wohl nicht in unmittelbarer Gefahr war, fortzurollen, stellte mir aber vor, dass es bei heftiger Bewegung im Inneren doch geschehen könne. Ich rief darum vorsichtig durch Namensanruf und ein Winkzeichen Emme, die noch hinten im Wagen sass, auch nach vorne, und sie stieg ebenfalls aus. Sie ging ein Stück in Fahrtrichtung weiter, um bei einem dort stehenden Auto etwas zu holen, mit dem man die Sache irgendwie in Ordnung bringen konnte. Sie musste das aber dort erst abmontieren. Ich sah ein bremsklotzartiges Gebilde neben dem Bahnwagen liegen und schleppte es herbei, um es im Notfall auf die Schienen legen zu können, damit er nicht fortliefe, oder legte es auch schon dorthin. Es war aus Metall und schwer. Jetzt fiel mir ein, dass ich auf den Schienen ein Stück zurückgehnen müsse, um eine andere hinterherkommende Strassenbahn oder ihr ähnliche Überlandbahn anhalten zu können. Als ich so durch die nächtliche Landschaft ging, hörte ich das Brausen eines Zuges irgendwo. Im letzten Moment merkte ich, dass es ein Fernzug war, der mir entgegenbrauste, und sprang zur Seite. Er raste an mir vorbei. Erst in diesem Moment wurde mir schlagartig klar, dass er auf den selben Schienen fuhr und jeden Moment auf den stehen gebliebenen Anhänger auffahren müsste. Eine Reihe von Gedanken jagten mir durch den Kopf: Wie gut, dass Emme ausgestiegen ist. Wenn ich nur dass Chaos und die Verletzten bei dem Zusammenstoss nicht sehen muss, denn in Richtung zu Emme muss ich ja wieder an dieser Stelle vorbei. Kann ich nicht eine Abkürzung durch den Wald gehen? Helfen kann ich ja doch nicht. Vielleicht sieht der Lokomotivführer den Wagen ja noch rechtzeitig und kann gerade noch rechtzeitig eine Notbremsung machen. Ich müsste jeden Moment die Geräusche des bevorstehenden Zusammenstosses oder im Glücksfall der Notbremsung hören. In dieser Situation erwachte ich, sah und hörte Emme neben mir im Bett liegen und brauchte einige Momente, um zu begreifen, dass ich geträumt hatte, entschloss mich nur schwer, es aufzuschreiben.

Eine sagte: "Bist Du krank?" und fütterte mich dann mit kleinen Butterbrothäppchen Das tat wegen seiner Mütterlichkeit gut.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2618 (1993-04-24 - Zürich)Gespräch mit Ludwig Binswanger.

Ich sagte zu ihm: "Durch diese Tür sind Sie zum ersten mal mit mir gegangen, als ich Sie kennen lernte in den fünfziger Jahren" und war davon gerührt. Wir sprachen über wissenschaftliche Themen. Vorher andere Traumszenen. Wir waren mit einem alten Auto auf einer einsamen Landstrasse stecken geblieben und versuchten nun, durch Winken ein Auto anzuhalten, das uns mitnehmen und das Auto abschleppen könnte. Es fuhren aber die meisten vorbei, oder konnten das kleine Auto nicht abschleppen, so dass es immer später und auch dunkler wurde. (109 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2619 (1993-04-25 - Zürich)Ich bin zu Gast in einem Haus, das der Familie v.Oertzen-Roggow gehört. Unten in dem Haus wohnt eine Tochter von Gerda v.Oertzen, die Sabine heisst. Ich will nun einem jungen Mann, der irgendwie auch in dem Haus wohnt, erklären, dass ich vorhin mit der Mutter dieser Frau, also mit Gerda v.Oertzen-Roggow telephoniert habe, und sage zu ihm: Ich habe gerade mit der Mutter der Frau v.Oertzen, die in der untersten Etage wohnt, telephoniert. Er kuckt mich verständnislos an und ich erkläre noch einmal genau, dass es die jetzt gerade verreiste Frau ist, die in der untersten Etage wohnt. Er sagt: "Aber, die heisst Sablonix." Ich sage: "Dann war sie eben schon mal verheiratet". In diesem Moment fällt mir ein, dass ich damals in Roggow Bilder von ihrer Hochzeit gesehen habe, wo sie sehr schön aussah, wie Uta von Naumburg, und sage: "Ja, das war sie auch". Er sagt: "Nein die Frau war noch nie verheiratet". Ich weiss es aber besser, doch nun wird mir klar, dass Frau v.Oertzen, mit der ich telephoniert habe, ja eigentlich garnicht mehr lebt. Ich sage darum zu ihm, dass sie vielleicht garnicht mehr lebe, aber man manchmal doch so ein lebhaftes Gefühl habe, als ob man mit jemand spräche. Mir ist klar, dass das für ihn merkwürdig klingen muss. Ich will aber verhindern, dass er zu meinen Gastgebern von diesem Telephongespräch spricht. Vorher in einer anderen Szene wohnte mein Vater oben in dem Haus und ich habe das Gefühl, dass ich mal wieder hinaufgehen und ihn besuchen muss, weil es doch merkwürdig wäre, wenn ich mich zu wenig um ihn kümmere.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2620 (1993-04-25 - Zürich)Wir liefen leicht und federnd durch die Landschaft über Wiesen und Felder, Wege und Böschungen, um das Essen für ein Fest dorthin zu bringen. Wir trugen es in einem Korb auf dem Kopf. Mein Begleiter war Christian v.Ferber oder ein anderer Bekannter. Wir kamen rechtzeitig dort an. Die Teilnehmer standen schon redend dort. Es hatte aber noch nicht angefangen, weil anderes noch fehlte. Die Gastgeberin begrüsste uns erfreut und dankend und bat um Verständnis dafür, dass noch nicht alles da sei. Es war eine sehr leichte und freundliche Stimmung, die auch mit dem leichten federnden Laufen zusammenhing. (97 words)

Ich frage ihn, wie lange man etwa braucht, dieses Treppenstück hoch zu laufen. Er sagt, etwas verlegen lächelnd und stolz. "Ich brauche 4,5 Sekunden." Ich sage: "Das ist wirklich eine sehr kurze Zeit". Es ist eine Treppe in der Wohnung, auf der diese Wettkämpfe stattfinden, die gerade vorbereitet werden. Die Treppe ist wie eine Bodentreppe (Speichertreppe) relativ schmal und von einem geschlossenen Holzverschlag umgeben, der zum Treppeneingang hin offen ist. Sie windet sich auch etwas. Ich überlege, dass ich das wahrscheinlich auch ganz gut können würde. Dann andere Szene: Ein kleiner sehr charmanter Junge ist da,der schon sprechen kann und mit dem ich mich unterhalte. Dann gehen wir die Treppe runter. Er wohnt in der Wohnung darunter und geht mit einer älteren Frau, vielleicht seiner Grossmutter, in die untere Wohnung, deren Tür die Frau öffnet. Er verabschiedet sich feierlich. Sein ganzes Verhalten ist durch einen grossen Charm gekennzeichnet. Dann noch eine dritte Szene mit einer jungen Frau, wo ich aber die Einzelheiten vergessen habe. Auch diese Szene hatte aber einen freundlichen Charakter. (193 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2623 (1993-04-29 - Zürich)Wir wohnten irgendwo zur Miete und hatten einen Säugling zu versorgen. Zur Miete gehörte auch die Badbenutzung bei der Wirtin eine Treppe tiefer, einer schwierigen alten Frau. Dort waren auch eine Schüssel und anderes zum Waschen des Säuglings, die wir dort holen konnten und für die wir auch Miete bezahlen mussten. Also ging ich mit dem Säugling unter dem Arm die Treppe herunter, um diese Sachen zu holen. Fussmatten, die am jeweiligen Kopf der Treppen lagen, hatte jemand über Nacht auf die jeweils oberste Treppenstufe gelegt, so dass man drohte darüber zu fallen. Aber ich konnte ihnen ausweichen. Als ich mit dem Säugling im Arm unten ankam, begann die Wirtin davon zu reden, dass die Miete für die Waschschüssel nun erhöht werde. Das hatte sie schon mehrfach ganz willkürlich getan und ich verlor nun die Geduld und sagte, unter diesen Umständen wolle ich ihre Schüssel nicht mehr, sie könne nicht ständig die Miete willkürlich erhöhen, und ging mit dem Säugling unter dem Arm weg. In diesem Moment schien ihr das Gewissen zu schlagen und sie wollte nun direkt an herunterhängenden Stricken in unsere Wohnung hinauf klettern, wie an Lianen, wohl um Zeit zu sparen und irgend etwas zu unternehmen. Da es eine alte Frau war, die nun kletternd an den lianen-artigen Stricken hing und herabzustürzen drohte, musste ich mit dem Baby unter dem Arm hinterher klettern, um sie halten zu können So kamen wir kletternd oben an. Dort war eine Holztür in dem die Brüstung zum Treppenhaus abschliessenden Geländer, die man nun aufschliessen musste, um wieder auf sicheren Boden zu gelangen. Aber der Schlüssel steckte nicht. So rief ich nach Emme, die oben war, aber es dauerte eine Zeit, bis sie den Schlüssel hatte und kam. So musste ich gleichzeitig mich selbst an den Stangen des Geländers, das Baby im Arm und die alte Frau mit den Händen halten, damit sie nicht abstürzte. Das Ganze wurde immer schwerer und mühsamer, zu halten, und ich musste die Fäuste krampfhaft schliessen, damit sie sich nicht von den hölzernen Gitterstangen lösten und wir alle herabgestürzt wären. Es wurde immer schwieriger, und ich erwachte mit einem Angstschrei, den Emme neben mir im Bett hörte und fragte, was los sei. (365 words)

Diesen Satz sagte ich, als wir in die Wohnung kamen und sahen, dass Hf. einen Zettel mit einer Gratulation zu Emmes Geburtstag an die Wand geheftet hatte. Dann hatte er aber, als der Zettel nicht reichte, an der Wand direkt weiter geschrieben. Man erkannte sofort seine typische Handschrift. Er hatte mit grosser Schrift und grosszügig seine Gratulation geschrieben. Ich dachte dann darüber nach, wieviel Jahrzehnte vergangen waren, seit er zum ersten mal das selbe gemacht hatte, nämlich zu Emmes 29. Geburtstag, wo er mit Hautchreme im "Käfig", meinem kleinen Zimmer in Freiburg, eine 30 an die Wand geschrieben hatte. (111 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2626 (1993-05-02 - Zürich)Schon als ich heimkam, sah ich auf den Stufen zur Wohnung allerlei Unordnung und einen Damenstrumpf um die Türklinke gewickelt. Drinnen stiess ich mit dem Fuss in der dunklen Wohnung gleich an einen Körper, der dann anfing sich zu bewegen und sich aufzurichten. Es war ein Mann, der dort quer vor der Tür liegend geschlafen hatte und nun deutlich etwas betroffen war, irgendetwas Entschuldigendes sagte. Dann zeigte sich das ganze Ausmass: Überall lagen Leute, die irgendwie schliefen. Die ganze Wohnung, die mein Bruder und ich bewohnten, war in verheerender Unordnung. Leere Weinflaschen standen umher, runtergefallene Sachen lagen am Boden, alle Möbel waren verschoben. Es waren die Spuren eines Festes, wo die Leute betrunken waren. Aber ich sah, dass der Schaden trotz des Chaos sich in Grenzen hielt, und fragte nach meinem Bruder. Jemand zeigte auf die Tür eines Nebenzimmers und sagte, dass er wahrscheinlich dort sei. Dann erwachte ich. (149 words)

In dem Geschäft ist ein Junge, den sie Jimmy nennen und der eine knallbunte Jacke anprobiert, die ihm offenbar gefällt, obwohl sie viel zu bunt ist. Er betrachtet sich damit im Spiegel. Emme sagt im Hinausgehen: "Es steht Dir nicht, Jimmy". Der Kranlastwagen ist in eckigen soliden Formen gebaut und erinnert an einen Jeep, ist aber viel grösser. Der sehr solide Kran ist hinten auf der Ladefläche angebracht. (92 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2628 (1993-05-04 - Zürich)Fuhr mit Herrn Siegenthaler in der Strassenbahn und erzählte ihm von meinen Beobachtungen einer Baustelle auf der Strasse vor unserem Haus, die bewirkte, dass die Strasse jeden Tag anders aussah. Später am Tag traf ich ihn in einer Stichstrasse neben der ETH, wo ebenfalls eine Baustelle war. Er betrachtete die Strasse und sagte, dass sie in der jetztigen Situation aussehe wie eine bestimmte Strasse oder Allee, ich glaube, in Berlin. Ich erinnerte ihn an unser Gespräch am Morgen und das, was ich von der täglichen Wandlung der Strasse vor unserem Haus durch die Baustelle erzählt hatte, und sagte, dass er nun hier dasselbe erlebe. Dabei wurde mir klar, dass er diese Baustelle offenbar aus seinem Fenster im Seitenflügel der ETH sähe. Während ich redete drehte ich spielerisch einen kleinen Holzhammer, den ich in der Hand hielt. Er sagte "O das nicht" und schloss das Auge. Ich hatte bei der Drehung des Hämmerchens den Boden berührt und Staub aufgewirbelt, der ihm ins Auge geflogen war. Er streckte den Arm und die Hand schräg nach unten vor sich aus, wobei die Hand und die Finger leicht nach oben gebogen waren, wie bei einer Dirigentengebärde, und zählte laut, um die Zeit einzuteilen, die er den Schmerz des ins Auge geflogenen Sandkörnchens aushalten musste, bis dieser verebbte oder das Sandkörnchen wieder aus dem Auge herausging. Dabei hielt er das Auge weiter geschlossen. Ich war sehr bestürzt über das, was ich angerichtet hatte und erwachnte mit einem leisen Schrei, den Emme im Bett neben mir hörte und fragte: "Was ist?". Ich sagte, jetzt im Wachen: "Traum" Und sie antwortete: "Garnicht wahr". (266 words)

Er antwortet, dass er das weiss. Dann fragt er, ob denn die Zeit reicht, die ganze umfangreiche Arbeit zu lesen. Ich antworte ausweichend, weil ich ihm ja nicht sagen kann, dass ich manches nur kursorisch lese. (83 words)

Zunächst in der Srassenbahn, die vorne spitz zuläuft wie der Bug eines Schiffes und zwei schmale schlitzartige Fenster hat, die wie durch einen Holm getrennt sind. Ich kann durch sie hinaus in die Landschaft sehen, aber nicht auf den Boden, sodass ich nicht erkennen kann, wann die Haltestelle kommt, an der ich aussteigen muss. Ich gehe darum im Wagen zurück und auch deshalb, weil es mir unheimlich ist, soweit vorne zu sitzen, falls es einen Zusammenstoss gibt. Dann bin ich ausgestiegen und gehe durch eine sturzackerartig aufgewühlte Landschaft in der ich schliesslich auf einen turmartig aufgeschütteten Erdhaufen gerate, von dem ich einen grossen Baukomplex sehe, der aber teilweise noch im Bau ist und von dem ich nicht genau weiss, ob das nun das Haus ist, in dem Schmidtchen wohnt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2632 (1993-05-07 - Zürich)Ich musste einen Vortrag halten, für dessen Vorbereitung ein Blatt wichtig war, auf dem weitzeilig etwas mit der Schreibmaschine geschrieben war, zwischen dessen Zeilen Heidegger etwas in seiner Handschrift geschrieben hatte, sodass immer eine Zeile Schreibmaschinenschrift mit einer handschriftlichen Zeile Heideggers abwechselte. Es war Heideggers typische deutsche Schrift. Jetzt aber konnte ich das Blatt nicht finden. Emme hatte etwas davon für mich abgeschrieben, sodass ich annahm, das Blatt müsse noch bei ihr sein, und sie danach fragte. Sie war aber gerade mit etwas anderem beschäftigt und hörte deshalb nicht ganz richtig zu. Um sie aufmerksam zu machen, sagte ich ganz betont und skandiert: Das ist mein Vortrag, damit sie sehen sollte, wie wichtig es sei. Ich hatte wohl schon das Blatt mit ihrer Abschrift, das wohl etwa die Hälfte des Textes enthielt. Ich erwachte mit Herzklopfen und dem Gefühl der Aufregung. Das Blatt enthielt wohl das Konzept des Vortrags, das zugleich aber irgendwie auch wie ein Vortragkonzept Heideggers war. (159 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2633 (1993-05-07 - Zürich)Ich war in Roggow, in dem holzgetäferten Esssaal. Ich sah, dass die Fenster sich im Winde bewegten, und merkte, dass sie beim Schliessen in der Mitte nicht richtig zugemacht waren. Darum stieg ich auf die Fensterbank, sodass ich die grossen oben runden Fensterflügel durch Andrücken und Drehen des Griffes schliessen konnte. Dabei bemerkte ich eine lange Stoffbahn, die irgendwo herabhing, und sich bewegte, weil sie nur lose über eine Stange hing. Ich liess sie ganz herabgleiten und merkte dabei, dass auch die Holzfläche dahinter sich bewegte. Es war eine Wandschranktür, die nicht ganz verschlossen war. Ich sagte das zu den Leuten im Raum und erinnerte mich nun, dass in diesen Wandschränken früher das Geschirr war, und erzählte diese Erinnerung. Eine Frau sagte: "Ja, wir haben hier sechsundzwanzig Wandschränke" - Es kann auch eine etwas andere Zahl gewesen sein, die sie sagte, aber in dieser Grössenordnung. - Ich sagte, dass ich mich daran erinnere, dass das Geschirr in den Wandschränken mich damals sehr fasziniert habe und dass ich an meine Mutter damals geschrieben hätte. "Sie haben das Geschirr im Esszimmer in Wandschränken in der getäferten Wand",.Sie fragten, wann das gewesen sei, und ich sagte: "1939, ich war damals dreizehn Jahre alt." Ich erwachte sehr berührt von diesem Traum über Roggow. (209 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2634 (1993-05-08 - Zürich)"Wie weit geht denn Binswanger in dem neuen Buch auch - wie soll ich sagen - auf die Beziehung zum Leib ein?". Der Gesprächspartner lächelt und schweigt. - "Aus ihrem Lächeln schliesse ich: Überhaupt nicht. " - "Genau so ist es", sagte er und: "Wie kommt das?". Ich antworte: "Vielleicht gerade, weil er soviel in dem anderen Buch schon darüber geschrieben hat, dass es jetzt selbstverständlich ist, er nicht noch einmal darüber sprechen muss". - Es ist ein Gespräch bei einem Treffen in irgend einer Institution mit einem Mann, der ein ganz neues Buch Ludwig Binswangers gelesen hat. Vorher andere Szenen: Ich musste Corinne erklären, wo in der Stadt ein bestimmtes Institut sei. Es gab verschiedene Stellen in der Stadt, die ein bisschen Freiburg glich, wo wir zu tun hatten: Dort, wo wir gerade waren, dann im Zentrum, in der Universität, aber auch mehr aussen in einer Gegend jenseits davon. - Wenn es Freiburg wäre, war es etwa die Gegend der Nervenklinik in der Hauptstrasse in Herdern. Dort hatte ein Hausmeister irgend etwas gemacht, repariert oder erfunden. Vorher andere Szene, wohl in dieser Gegend. An einer Strassenecke im Sonnenschein trafen sich Eva und ein anderes Mädchen. Es kann Bille gewesen sein. Eva war fast nackt, hatte ein Kleid, das sie öffnete, bis man auch die Schamhaare sehen konnte, die hell und fast blond waren. Ihr Bauch war gewölbt, als ob sie ein Baby kriegte. Sie lehnte an eine Hecke und genoss die Sonne, die ihr auf den Bauch schien. Sie tat das alles spielerisch, während sie über eine Sache sprachen. Ich beteiligte mich auch irgendwie an dem Gespräch. - Dann zweiter Traum: Ich musste zu einer Veranstaltung, wusste aber nicht mehr, wann sie anfing und wo ich die Unterlagen hatte. Es war schon fast zwölf Uhr, und dies schien mir die Zeit zu sein, wann sie anfing. Ich musste aber auch noch mit dem Zug dahin fahren. Dann musste ich dringend auf die Toilette. Aber alle Toiletten waren besetzt, als ich, um eine zu suchen, die Treppe auf und ab lief. Dann war Dieter Sträuli da, der beruhigend wirkte. Er wusste, wo die Unterlagen waren - im Mittelzimmer - und meinte, die Sache sei erst um siebzehn Uhr. Vorher hatte ich noch etwas mit dem Computer erledigen müssen, wozu ich Kopfhörer aufhatte, weil es etwas Akustisches war, und an einem Gerät etwas abseits vom Computer sass, zu dem ich vorher mit Hilfe von Stöpseln und Kabeln Verbindungen hergestellt hatte. Es funktionierte auch zuerst. Dann kamen viele kleine elektronische Piepser, die ich auf die Arbeit des Computers mit der Diskette zurückführte. Sie dauerten aber länger als sonst und hörten schliesslich auf. Eine Stimme im Kopfhörer sagte "Absturz". Dann war es still. Offenbar war das die Methode, wie akustisch ein Computerabsturz mitgeteilt wurde. Ich eilte zum Computer, drückte den Knopf, um ihn auszuschalten, und zog alle Stöpsel heraus. Ich erwachte aus dem ganzen Traum mit Blasenandrang. (484 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2635 (1993-05-09 - Zürich)Ich ging mit Familie R., Vater und Sohn, spazieren. Wir standen an der Tür irgend eines Gebäudes. Der Vater war hereingegangen, um rasch etwas zu erledigen, kam aber lange nicht zurück. Ich betrachtete die Spiegelung im Fenster eines Raums, wo durch die Spiegelung der Raum, in den ich hineinsah, und die Landschaft, die sich spiegelte, sich durchdrangen. So konnte man Wandschränke in der Landschaft ausmachen. Ich sagte zu dem Sohn: "Eine interessante Spiegelung". Aber er hörte das garnicht richtig, sondern ging hinein, um nach seinem Vater zu suchen. Ich sagte, dass ich draussen warten würde. Andere Szene: Markus' Vater fand, dass ich zur Kräftigung Sahne essen solle. Wir hatten lange geschlafen und kamen zum Frühstück. Der Vater war schon lange wach und hatte das Frühstück liebevoll für uns aufgebaut. So hatte er die Sahne in meinen Schuh gegossen, diesen auf einen kleinen Schemel gestellt und zum Schutz ein Kissen davor. Ich wollte aus dem Schuh trinken, sah aber, dass auf der Milch, für die ich es hielt, sich eine Haut gebildet hatte, liess es und wachte auf. Vorher noch andere Traumszene, wo ich aufgewacht bin und noch im Nachthemd in die Landschaft gehe. Eine grosse steinerne Schwelle durchzieht die Landschaft. Jemand nennt sie die Isteiner Schwelle. Sie geht als ein langes Band durch den ganzen Raum, den man sehen kann. Sie ist etwa nur zwei Mann hoch, aber schwer zu überwinden. Ein kleines Treppenhaus, oder eigentlich zwei, ist wendeltreppenartig in das Innere des Felsens gebrochen, so dass man hochgehen kann. Meine Begleiter gehen durch das andere, oben treffen wir uns wieder. Vorher hatten sie ein Gespräch geführt, wo der Jüngere zum Älteren sagte: "Man brauchte nur diese Schwelle zu überwinden". Es ging dabei um einen Bau, wohl einer Strasse. Ich bemerke, dass ich nur mein Nachthemd anhabe, trage aber die Hose überm Arm und die Schuhe in der Hand und beschliesse, sie anzuziehen. In noch einer anderen Szene habe ich einen neuen Photoapparat in einer weichen Tasche und versuche, schon in der Morgendämmerung Bilder zu machen (336 words)

Dort waren zwei Plastiken von griechischen Pferden, grosse Plastiken, sehr gesammelt und zugleich in schneller Bewegung oder zum Sprung bereit. Die Plastiken waren zugleich auch sehr stilisiert oder abstrakt und dominierten das Zimmer. Andere Dinge lagen da, wie improvisiert, aber man spürte, dass ihre Anordnung wohl überlegt war. Andere Szenen des Traums handelten von einer Veranstaltung, die auf irgend etwas hinweisen sollte, aber so organisiert war, dass es keinen Veranstaltungsrummel geben sollte, sondern man zum Nachdenken gebracht wurde. Dann war es Zeit, dass ich ging, denn ich musste mich auf eine Vorlesung vorbereiten, die ich in kurzer Zeit halten musste. Ich faltete das Manuskriptblatt auf und sah, dass es ein interessantes Thema war, dass ich aber diese Vorlesung vor etwa einem Jahr schon einmal in Gadamers Gegenwart gehalten hatte. Für den Fall, dass er wieder kommen würde, war es also nötig, ein anderes Thema zu nehmen. Ich überlegte, was ich nun tun solle und erwachte. (158 words)

Auch ein Sträuli-Junge war dabei. Nach einiger Zeit spielten die Mädchen bei uns in der Stube, während die Jungen in den Hof gingen und dort mit dem Fahrrad umherfuhren. Der Sträuli-Junge wurde dabei von dem zu uns gehörigen angefeuert und sie machten immer wildere Sachen. Man hörte es aus dem Fenster. Sehen konnte man es nur teilweise. Ich konnte nicht genau erkennen, was sie mit den Rädern machten, hörte aber, wie sie von der Gefahr von Stürzen redeten und sagten, das müsse man eben in Kauf nehmen. Ich rief sie herauf und sagte, um dieser Gefahr ein Ende zu machen, wir wollten alle spazieren gehen. Nun schlug der zu Besuch gekommene Sträuli-Junge vor, die Fechtsäbel mit zu nehmen, damit der unsere ihm etwas zeigen könne. Ich überlegte kurz, ob ich Emme bei der Entscheidung zuziehen solle, sagte aber dann sofort "Lieber nicht", was sie nach kurzem Sirnrunzeln hinnahmen. (165 words)

Das einzige, das in Frage zu kommen scheint, ist eine herabhängende Kette, an der man herabklettern könnte wie an einem Strick. Es ist aber die Frage, ob man nicht abrutschen wird und ob die Kette, die alt ist, nicht bricht. Ich überlege, ob man lieber eine Weile da oben warten soll, bis sich vielleicht eine Gelegenheit bietet.( Erwachen mit Kopfweh. Noch im Erwachen die Überlegung, dass wir ja auf irgend einem Weg dorthin gelangt sein müssen, den man zurückgehen können müsste.

Die Verteilung der Broschüre an alle Haushalte der Strasse war schon in einem Mitteilungsblatt angekündigt, das die selbe Frau schon am Morgen verteilt hatte. Ich war jetzt gerade bei Nachbarn und hatte denen mein Interesse an der Broschüre erzählt. Die Hausfrau hatte aus dem Fenster blickend gesehen, dass die Frau, die die Sachen verteilt, sich nähert, und mir vorgeschlagen, doch hinauszugehen, damit ich die Broschüre auch wirklich bekäme. Das tat ich und sah nun die Frau ankommen. Sie stieg gerade eine zweiseitige Trittleiter hoch, die über eine kleine Baustelle oder ähnliches hinwegführte, und auf der anderen Seite die Leiter wieder herunter, obwohl dieser Weg über die Leiter eigentlich garnicht nötig war, weil man auch neben ihr direkt gehen konnte. Aber das hatte sie wohl nicht gesehen. Ich hörte sie auch etwas zu jemanden sagen. Ich überlegte nun, wie ich motivieren sollte, dass ich ihr entgegen gegangen war, ob ich zum Beispiel sagen sollte: "Ich habe Sie an Ihrer Stimme erkannt" und dann nach der angekündigten Broschüre fragen. Das kam mir aber dann komisch vor, weil man bereits sehen konnte, dass sie die Broschüren in der Hand hielt. Dann fiel mir ein, dass ich natürlich auch den Nachbarn, bei denen ich war, eine solche mitbringen müsse. Ich müsste also der Frau erklären, dass ich nicht in meiner eigenen Wohnung, sondern bei Nachbarn war. Dann würde ich ihr aber auch beschreiben müssen, wo ich selbst in einem der Nebenhäuser wohnte. Es gab offenbar nur ein solches Heft pro Haushalt. Das Ganze erschien mir ziemlich kompliziert und ich erwachte. Das Thema der Broschüre, das mir so wichtig war, habe ich nicht behalten. (287 words)

Ich musste sagen, wie ich mich an seiner Stelle entschieden hätte, und entschied mich für Stipe. Später fragte ich andere, wie sie sich entschieden hätten und sie enstschieden sich alle auch für Stipe und sagten dabei: "Für das Stillhalteabkommen mit Stipe". Sie wussten offenbar mehr über die Sache als ich . Tina wurde sogar recht böse, als ich mich an den Namen Stipe nicht richtig erinnerte. Offenbar gehörte das zur Bildung und man musste es wissen. Vorher war ich krank gewesen, es war eine Art Nesselfieber oder etwas ähnliches. Dr. Peter war da gewesen, während gleichzeitig viel Besuch da war, und hatte mich untersucht, was die anderen zum Teil garnicht gemerkt hatten. Er hatte mich in's Bett geschickt. Es schien aber nur eine ganz leicht Krankheit zu sein. Die Wahl zwischen Ruhm und Stipe spielte wohl auch bei der Therapie eine Rolle. Das ist in der Erinnerung nicht ganz klar. Auch Salmiakgeist kam vor und war wichtig. Er war irgendwie in der Mitte zwischen zwei anderen Dingen, vielleicht zwischen den Wegen der Entscheidung des Herakles, es war aber im Traum die Mitte zwischen etwas anschaulich Sichtbarem, ich glaube auf dem Boden.

Ohne Aufforderung hat er auch noch die Stosskante repariert, die etwas durchgestossen war. Dabei hat er aber einfach die Hose um zwei bis drei Zentimeter gekürzt, sodass sie jetzt nicht mehr passt. Emme entdeckt das zuerst. Ich ärgere mich furchtbar, denn es ist eine der ausserordentlich bequemen sogenannten Autohosen, die man im Bund verstellen kann, sodass sie immer bequem sitzen. Die Sache ist ungeheuer solide genäht und es ist zu befürchten, dass er einfach Stoff abgeschnitten hat. Vielleicht hat er einen Lehrling das machen lassen. - Andere Szene: Ich habe in Eile, vielleicht im Dunklen, einen Traum oder etwas anderes aufgeschrieben auf ein Blatt, auf dem schon etwas anderes geschrieben ist. So entstand ein Palimpsest. Ich habe dann um die neue Schrift einen Strich gezogen, sodass man sie von der alten, die ein Doppelblatt füllt, unterscheiden kann. Auf diese Weise sind zwei neue Schriftinseln auf der alten Schrift, die sehr hingehaucht und teilweise wie eine Hintergrundzeichnung wirkt, entstanden. Ich vertiefe mich in dieses merkwürdige Bild und überlege, ob ich die nur teilweise lesbaren Worte der alten und der neuen Schrift abschreiben soll. (193 words)

Im Raum war auch Konrad Lorenz, dessen Name fiel, den aber ein Mann der die Situation dirigieren musste, nicht kannte und der deshalb bei seinem Namen, den er nicht verstanden hatte, nachfragte. Konrad Lorenz sagte, seinen Namen deutlich aussprechend noch einmal "Lorenz". Der Mann, der offenbar für die Unterbringung zuständig war, redete über die Herkunft der Betten, die offenbar irgendwoher übernommen waren.

Dort war im Haus jetzt ein Betrieb untergebracht, in dem aus einer flüssigen Lösung Gold gewonnen wurde, das in der Flüssigkeit enthalten war, wohl etwa wie in einer Saline das Salz in der Flüssigkeit. Wir überlegten, dass wir irgendeine Sachfrage stellen mussten, als ob wir etwas von dem Betrieb besichtigen wollten, um in das Haus zu gelangen. Dann gingen wir hinein und fragten etwas. Eine sehr freundliche Frau erklärte, dass in dem Betrieb etwas anders gemacht würde als früher - es war hier so, als wenn man früher das Gold wie ein Kinderspielzeug hätte schmecken können, wohl etwa wie Kandiszucker, der sich aus einer Flüssigkeit auskristallisiert hatte. Das sei jetzt nicht mehr so, und wenn wir in die Gegend gehen würden, wo das Gold aus der Flüssigkeit, die jetzt anscheinend als eine weissliche Flüssigkeit in der Erde war, kondensiert, wären wir in Gefahr, hinein zu fallen und unser Leben lang beschädigt oder invalid zu sein. Und das wollten wir doch sicher nicht. Dann sagte sie aber, wir könnten im Haus - das andere war offenbar etwas, was ausserhalb gemacht wurde,- vielleicht sehen, wie das Gold aus den Platten geschleudert würde. Das war jetzt wohl irgendwie so, wie Honig aus den Waben geschleudert wird. Sie müsse dann mit uns zu Herren Fessler gehen. Wir stimmten interessiert zu, weil wir so in die altbekannten Räume des Hauses kommen würden. Sie ging mit uns durch einen schön wieder hergestellten weissen Raum, den ich an seinen Proportionen und Raummassen als die alte, ehemals holzgetäfelte, Diele erkannte, nur die Holztäfelung fehlte, aber die Mauer, die bei unserem letzten Besuch, noch in der DDR Zeit, quer durch den Raum gezogen war, war wieder entfernt. Ich konnte auch einen Blick ins ehemalige Esszimmer werfen, in dem früher die Ahnenbilder hingen. Auch dies war wieder in einem guten Zustand, weiss gestrichen, aber ohne die Holztäfelung und ohne die Ahnenbilder. Aber man konnte sich gut in die alte Situation der früheren Zeit, wo ich in Roggow war, zurückversetzen, und ich war sehr berührt davon. Die Frau führte uns nun zur Haustür aus der Diele heraus - wir waren irgendwo von hinten in das Haus gekommen - und ich sagte beim Durchqueren der Tür zu Emme leise: "Die Diele hat wieder ihre alte Form". Sie antwortete leise: "Wie schön". Ich war nun von dem Wiedererkennen der alten Räume sehr ergriffen. Die Frau führte uns durch eine andere Tür gleich wieder hinein, und zwar durch die in der DDR-Zeit neu gebrochene Tür in die "französische Stube", in der ehemals die gemalten Kopien der Bilder des Medicizyklus von Rubens als Wandgemälde, bzw. Wandbespannung die ganzen Wände bedeckten und dann in der DDR-Zeit ein Konsumladen war, den ich aber nicht von innen gesehen hatte. Jetzt kamen wir hinein und auch dieser Raum war jetzt gut in Ordnung gehalten und weiss gestrichen. Es kam nun der angekündigte Herr Fessler, der uns sehr freundlich begrüsste. Ich überlegt, ob ich zu den Leuten sagen solle, dass ich früher in dem Haus gewesen war, tat es aber nicht, weil ich dachte, dass es sie eher irritieren würde. Der Herr Fessler fragte uns nun nach einem Konzert, das wir am Morgen irgendwo in einer Stadt gehört hatten, und ich war etwas betroffen, weil ich mich im Moment nicht mehr erinnern konnte, wer dort gespielt hatte, und er anhub, danach zu fragen. So erwachte ich besorgt und seufzte, was Emme im Bett neben mir hörte und fragte - jetzt im Wachen -: "Was ist? " Ich antwortete: "Traum". (586 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2652 (1993-05-21 - Zürich)Christian v.Ferber und ein dritter Mann und ich waren zusammen und gleichzeitig mit Gisela befreundet. So wurden wir allmählich eifersüchtig und beschlossen, auseinander zu ziehen, um die Reibungsfläche zu verringern. Ich musste dabei aus meiner Wohnung ausziehen. Darum fehlten mir dauernd irgendwelche Gegenstände, zum Beispiel meine Baskenmütze, bestimmte Schuhe und anderes. So ging es nicht mehr weiter. Ich beschloss darum, in meine Wohnung zu gehen und diese Sachen zu holen. Es war aber schon Abend oder Nacht. Als ich das Treppenhaus hochstieg, stellte ich mir vor, Gisela könne vielleicht mit Christian im Bett liegen. Sie war zuletzt vor allem mit dem dritten Mann zusammen gewesen. Sie wäre dann also sozusagen zu Christian zurückgekehrt. Ich stellte mir vor, dass ich mich zu ihnen ans Bett setzen würde und erst einmal einiges erklären, weil es auch viele Missverständnisse gegeben hatte. Dann erwachte ich. (141 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2653 (1993-05-23 - Zürich)Ich hatte an eine Wandtafel mit Kreide Zeichnungen gemacht, deren Inhalt erotisch und deren Form eher teppichartig war. Ein Mädchen, das zufällig vorbeikam und nicht wusste, von wem sie waren, nannte die Zeichnungen altmodisch und spiessig und zu wenig gestaltet. Ich sagte nicht, dass die Zeichnungen von mir waren, und fühlte mich etwas gekränkt und beleidigt. Ich beschloss, die Zeichnungen demnächst auszuwischen mit dem Tafelschwamm. (65 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2654 (1993-05-23 - Zürich)Ich stand neben dem Esstisch im Wohnzimmer. Emme ging mit einer Giesskanne vorbei. Sie war gerade beim Blumengiessen auf dem Balkon. Ich hörte ein platterndes Geräusch von herabtropfendem Wasser direkt neben mir am Boden und sah dort auch Wasser und wunderte mich und fragte Emme, wieso sie dort übergegossen habe und was sie dort gegossen habe. Sie rief entsetzt: "Da, da, sieh doch!", und zeigte schreckerstarrt auf die Wand neben mir. Ich blickte auf und sah an der Wand über dem Esstisch, zwischen Wohnzimmer und Mittelzimmer überall Wasser austreten in einer Diagonale, die vom Boden bis zur Decke reichte. Die Wand war überall schon ganz durchfeuchtet. Es war eine Katastrpophe. Ich zwang mich zur Ruhe, obwohl ich ratlos war, was man jetzt tun solle, und sagte: "Wo kann man anrufen, wenn man einen Wasserrohrbruch in der Wand hat?" Mir schossen Gedanken durch den Kopf, wie, die Polizei anzurufen, was mir aber ziemlich sinnlos schien. Ich überlegte, wer in einem solchen Fall eigentlich zuständig sei, sah die Gefahr, die das ganze Haus bedrohte und erwachte mit Herzklopfen und starkem Angstgefühl. (179 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2655 (1993-05-23 - Zürich)Wir waren zu einem Ausflug eingeladen bei Stinis nebenan. Sie hatten eine Menge Leute dazu eingeladen, Verwandte und Bekannte, die alle in dem Zimmer nebenan beieinander standen. Viele von ihnen hatte ich schon begrüsst, andere noch nicht. Da fiel mir ein, dass ich am Morgen einen Termin hatte, bei Max Müller oder jemand anders, und also garnicht mit konnte, und sagte dies zu Emme. Inzwischen wurde diese von Stini in einen anderen Raum der Wohnung gerufen und sagte noch im Weggehen: "Du kannst ja die anderen Gäste noch begrüssen, zum Beispiel die Irene", oder es war ein ähnlicher Name. Ich suchte diese Frau nun, fand sie aber nicht, aber andere an der Wand zu unserer Wohnung Stehende, die ich wohl auch noch nicht begrüsst hatte. Ich sagte zu ihnen, zwei Männern: "Ich weiss garnicht, ob wir uns schon begrüsst haben?" und streckte die Hand aus. Einer von beiden sagte: "Nein, aber wir sehen uns ja nachher", behielt aber seine Hand auf dem Rücken, sodass ich vergebens mit der ausgestreckten Hand dastand. Ich sagte: "Nein, ich kann nicht mitkommen". Er sagte: "Dann eben heute Abend". Ich zog schliesslich die vergebens ausgestreckte Hand zurück und war verärgert und deswegen ganz froh, dass ich nicht zu dem Ausflug konnte, und froh, Emme wieder zu finden, die gerade zurückkam und mit der ich hinausging.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2656 (1993-05-24 - Zürich)Ich war in einem öffentlichen Bad. Die Wannen waren viereckig, gleichsam kubisch, und hatten an einer Seite einen bequemen Einstieg. Sie waren in Reihen angeordnet. Ich bemerkte aber, dass die Wände mit Schaum bedeckt waren, Rückständen von Badeschaum von dem gerade vorher abgeflossenen Wasser. Ich putzte also die Wanne, an der ich war, mit einem an einem Stock befestigten Lappen, den ich vorfand und in das restliche noch am Boden befindliche Wasser tauchte, in das ich dazu hineinstieg. Dann beschloss ich, auch weitere Wannen so zu putzen, und ging mit meinem Stock und Lappen weiter. Es war dämmerig, sodass man nicht weit sehen konnte. Ich bemerkte nun, dass in der Reihe von Wannen, in der ich war, eine Lücke war, sodass ich eine Weile gehen musste, um zur nächsten Wanne zu kommen. Ich hörte Leute mir entgegen und an mir vorbei kommen, die sagten: "Jetzt wollen wir einmal jemand verhaften lassen, zum Beispiel den, der zu dieser Wanne hier gehört", wobei sie mich und meine eben von mir geputzte Wanne meinten. Es war ein abgekartetes Spiel. Der Vorwurf, den sie machen wollten, war der der Bereicherung oder Ähnliches. Ein Mann, der bei der eben von mir geputzten Wanne war, sagte zu ihnen: "Sie können den rechts oder links verhaften lassen, aber nicht diesen hier", und begann, mich zu verteidigen. Die beiden Leute aber antworteten: "Nein, diesen hier". Sie hatten nur einen Vorwand gesucht, um mich verhaften zu lassen. Es war eine Diktatur, wo es offenbar leicht war, so etwas zu tun, und ich hörte schon die Polizisten, die dafür da waren, heranmarschieren. In diesem Moment entdeckten andere an einer Wanne etwas und sagten: "Hier ist ja Öl. Die Wannen sind also doch nicht von selber heiss, sondern das Wasser ist mit Öl geheizt." Man hatte anscheinend geglaubt, dass das heisse Wasser ein Naturwunder, ein Naturphänomen sei, und vielleicht hatte jemand das Wasser mit Öl geheizt, um diesen Glauben zu erzeugen. Es war ein merkwürdiges Staatswesen, in dem ich mich da befand. Ich war nun in Gefahr, jeden Moment verhaftet zu werden, und erwachte. (343 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2657 (1993-05-24 - Zürich)Ich filme mit einer Filmkamera. Doch als ich fertig bin, gelingt es mir nicht, sie abzustellen. Alle Knöpfe, die ich drücke, bewirken etwas anderes. Verschiedenste Programme schalten sich ein. Da ich bei den Versuchen, die Kamera abzustellen, heftige Bewegungen mache, wird auf dem Film, der da entsteht, auch ein grosses Durcheinander zu sehen sein. Schliesslich öffnet sich sogar bei einem der vielen kleinen Knöpfe, die ich drücke, das Gehäuse, aber der Film läuft weiter, und ich halte das Gehäuse mit der Hand zu. Auch Emme, die zur Hilfe kommt, kann den Abstellknopf nicht finden. Ich suche nun eine Lupe, um die vielen kleinen Beschriftungen der Knöpfe lesen zu können. Inzwischen läuft der Film immer weiter, und ich kann mich auch weiterhin nicht erinnern, wo der Knopf zum Abstellen ist. Schliesslich erwache ich mit einem hörbaren Seufzer sehr beunruhigt und Emme, die neben mir schläft, fragt besorgt: "Was ist?" ich sage, nun im Wachen: "Traum, aber den schreib ich jetzt nicht auf. Ich hab vorhin schon einen aufgeschrieben". (167 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2659 (1993-05-25 - Zürich)Ich war zusammen mit Christian v.Ferber auf einer Gesellschaft oder einem ähnlichen Treffen. Er war Chirurg, ich glaube Hirnchirurg. Auf jeden Fall eine Nervenchirurgie, bei der er sehr feine Bewegungen machen musste. Plötzlich war er weg. Die Leute wunderten sich. Ich sagte: "Er muss operieren", denn ich hatte ihn unten, wo anscheinend seine Wohnung war, in einem Arztmantel gehen sehen. Als ich dies gesagt hatte, sah ich ihn in einem weissen overallartigen Gewand mit Kapuze mit vorgestreckten Armen die Treppe runtergehen. Es war das aktuelle Operationsgewand und er war offenbar direkt auf dem Wege zu einer Operation, wohl einem Notfall, zu dem er gerufen war. Das Vorstrecken der Hände war offenbar nötig, damit er vorher nicht irgendetwas berührte. In einer anderen Szene des Traums spielte Romy eine Rolle, die offenbar inzwischen in Berlin war. Sie hatte einen Brief geschickt, in dem sie sagte, dass ich der erste sei, der sie damals Berlin genannt habe, wofür sie mir danken wolle. (159 words)

Es ist nicht immer der selbe Raum, und den Leuten fehlt Schreibwerkzeug. Ich gehe also los und suche Bleistifte. In einem anderen leeren Hörsaal find ich welche, aber es ist so dunkel dort - Lichtschalter kann ich auch nicht finden -, dass ich nicht erkennen kann, ob es richtige Bleistifte oder ob es Farbstifte sind. Es besteht irgendwie die Gefahr, dass die Leute inzwischen weggehen und ich weiss auch nicht recht, was ich sagen und wie ich die Vorlesung halten soll. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2662 (1993-05-27 - Zürich)Ich war in einer nächtlichen Stadt, in der ich mich wenig auskannte, und geriet auf dem Weg irgendwohin in unheimliche, spitzwinklig verbundene Gassen, in denen es immer dunkler wurde. Vor einem ganz dunklen laternenlosen Wegstück kehrte ich um, weil ich meine goldene Uhr und Geld bei mir hatte und kein zu grosses Risiko eingehen wollte. Aber bald geriet ich wieder in dunkle Gassen, und dann geschah es: zwei undurchsichtige Gestalten mit verschlossenen Gesichtern standen da und traten stumm und fordernd auf mich zu. Ich überlegte, ob ich fliehen könnte, oder sie irgendwie niederschlagen. Dann Szenenwechsel: Ich war jetzt in einer Strasse in einer Gegend, in der verrufene Elemente auf den Strassen halb betrunken umherlagen, sodass man mühsam über sie steigen musste. Ein dicker Unterweltboss, der auch am Boden lag, packte mich und zog mich irgendwie zu Boden. Ich versuchte, ihn loszuwerden, und schlug ihn auf den Boden. Dann konnte ich fliehen, musste aber seine Verfolger jeden Moment erwarten. Am Ende der Gasse ging es in freies dunkles Land. Ich entschloss mich, hier in die dunkle Nacht hinein zu fliehen, obwohl ich nicht wusste, ob wohl nicht auch hier seine Häscher waren, oder seine Leute mir auf den Fersen sein würden und mich jeden Moment einholen könnten. Ich lief mit aller Kraft ins Dunkle hinein und kam schliesslich zwischen dörfliche Häuser, wo in der Gasse ein grosser Schäferhund stand. Ich merkte, dass er mir gutgesonnen und hilfreich war. Als ich an ihm vorbei lief, streifte ich sein Fell, von dem ein angenehmes beruhigendes elektrisches Feld ausging. Ich sagte irgendetwas Freundliches zu ihm. Jetzt kam ich immer mehr in Sicherheit. Kinder, die irgendwie zu mir gehörten, liefen mit mir und riefen: "Jetzt sind wir zu Hause". Plötzlich kam mir die Stadtgegend, in die ich jetzt nächtlich kam, altvertraut vor. Es war heimatlich. Ich kannte die Strassenfassaden, die Ladenschilder und die Laternen. Ein warmes freundliches Gefühl befiel mich und ich erwachte. (318 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2663 (1993-05-28 - Zürich)Es ging um Senderfrequenzen, die am eigenen Empfangsgerät eingestellt werden mussten. Es gab solche über ein Meter und solche unter ein Meter. Dazu irgend eine Verordnung, in der alles beschrieben war. - Vorher andere Szene. Ich ging irgendwo entlang. Eine Frau sagte irgendetwas - es war vielleicht in einem Einkaufscenter oder einer ähnlichen Anlage. Hinterher bekam ich eine Zahlungsanweisung, die sich "Zweite Mahnung" nannte und auf einen ziemlich hohen Geldbetrag bezog, den ich als Strafgebühr bezahlen sollte. Es wurde behauptet, ich habe irgendetwas gestreift oder sonst etwas ähnliches. Die Frau habe mich deshalb angesprochen und hinterher noch eine Mahnung und jetzt die zweite Mahnung ausgesprochen. Das Ganze war an den Haaren herbeigezogen. Die Frau hatte bloss etwas ganz Undeutliches gesagt, das ich nicht verstanden und kaum wahrgenommen hatte im Vorbeigehen, und danach nichts mehr. Ich fand die Sache empörend, wusste aber nicht recht, was ich tun sollte. Die Gebühr, die ich zahlen sollte, betrug 40 Mark oder Franken. Vielleicht war es einfacher, das einfach zu zahlen, als einen Rechtsstreit anzufangen mit einer offensichtlich unsoliden und skrupellosen Organisation. (177 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2664 (1993-05-29 - Zürich)Eine Situation, wo man viel im Freien herumstehen und warten musste, wie beim Militär. Es war auch eine Art Badesituation und ich war zuletzt im Wasser. Der Name Adrian kam vor, den ich, glaube ich, auch selber trug. Zuletzt wurden Diplome verteilt. Ein älterer Herr verteilte sie und sagte, es habe ja lange gedauert und wäre nun endlich so weit. Er begann mit dem Namen Adrian, der wohl der erste im Alphabet war und, glaube ich, zweimal vorkam, sodass ich wohl der Nächste war, denn es schien so, dass ich den Namen auch trug. Ich stand im Moment dieser Diplomverteilung noch mit der Badehose im Wasser. Das schien aber so in Ordnung zu sein, so wie man auch beim Militär immer irgendwo umher steht. (124 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2665 (1993-05-29 - Zürich)Es war vor der Vorlesung im Hörsaal 120. Ein Teil der Hörer war schon im Hörsaal versammelt. Es waren lauter Mädchen, die verspielt und vergnügt miteinander redeten. Unter ihnen Barbara Hampel. Ich merkte, dass die Verdunkelungsstoren von der vorhergehenden Vorlesung noch nicht hochgezogen waren, und begann, das zu tun. Ein Teil der Storen auf der Rückwand des Hörsaals, wo ich nun zum Lüften die Fenster öffnete, hing noch herab und war teilweise zerrissen. Das wunderte mich. Ich hatte noch etwas Zeit bis zum Beginn und ging nochmal hinaus. Jetzt wechselte die Szene: es war in unserer Wohnung. Die Hörer sassen schon im Wohnzimmer. Ich war im Mittelzimmer und konnte plötzlich mein Manuskript nicht finden, das ich dort irgendwo hingelegt hatte. Es waren jetzt nur noch wenige Sekunden bis zum Vorlesungsbeginn und ich rief verzweifelt Emme aus der Küche zur Hilfe, wo sie mit jemand, wohl mit Ros-Margrit, sprach, in der Hoffnung, dass sie das Manuskript finden werde. Nun bemerkte ich, dass ich noch im Hemd dastand und zog mir ganz schnell die Hose an, die an einem Haken an der Wand hing, und suchte nach Schuhen und erwachte. Ich überlegte noch im Erwachen, dass ich die Vorlesung zur Not auch ohne Manuskript halten könne, und dachte über einen möglichen ersten Satz nach, der, glaube ich, von Augustinus handelte.

Es war noch Seife oder etwas ähnliches dabei. Es war mir nicht ganz klar, ob es sich um Bäder im Schwimmbecken oder in Wannen handelte und ob die Seife oder Essenz etwas war, dessen Geruch ich mochte oder nicht mochte.

Man kann mit dem Boot an ihnen entlangfahren. Auch wir haben einen solchen Anschluss dort für unsere Leitungen. Man steckt seine Stecker in die Buchsen. Es ist wie eine Gegend in einer Grossstadt, teils zum Wohnen, teils für Industrie und Handel, wo alles ein bisschen improvisiert ist, etwa wie In Honkong. Irgendwo findet eine Diskussion statt, ob die Stadt, in der wir sind, eine Grossstadt sei, wofür ich plädiere, oder nicht. Sie ist sehr gross, unübersichtlich und ausgedehnt. Wenn ein Viertel verfallen ist, wird irgendwo anders am Rand ein neues entwickelt. Über die Reste des alten führen einfach Strassen hinweg, halb über das Wasser, in dem Teile der Stadt wie in einem Hafen zu liegen scheinen. In ihrer Grösse verglich ich sie in der Diskussion mit Paris und London und sagte, wenn sie keine Grossstadt wäre, wären diese es auch nicht. (158 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2671 (1993-06-02 - Zürich)Ich war in einer Stadt, deren Topographie Elemente von Schwerin enthielt, aber auch andere, bestimmte Fassaden, die ich zuerst nicht identifizieren konnte, dann aber in einer wie dämmerig auftauchenden Erinnerung als solche aus Hamburg, also aus meinen ersten sechs Lebensjahren erkannte. Es war also eine Realität, in der man wie bei einem Traum Elemente verschiedener Orte des Lebens wiedererkennen konnte, aber diese Topographie mit diesen Elementen verschiedener Städte existierte real. Dann in einem Haus mit einem faszinierenden ovalen Treppenhaus. Wir wohnten in dem Haus und gingen durch dies Treppenhaus hinab. Die Treppe war in einem grossen Oval geführt, aber der Zwischenraum im Innern des Ovals war durch steinerne Ebenen ausgefüllt, über die man auch leichten Schrittes hinablaufen konnte, bis man auf die Stufen der gegenüberliegenden etwas tiefer liegenden Seite des Ovals kam, wo man dann zwischen zwei Geländerstangen durch ein schmales gewundenes Treppenstück auf die nächst tiefere ovale Ebene gelangen konnte, die man ebenso spielend überqueren konnte. Man hätte aber auch die ganze ovale Treppe normal herabschreiten können. Das Gestein der ovalen Ebenen war schon von vielen Schritten sozusagen wie eine Steinplatte unter fliessendem Wasser in einem Fluss modelliert worden, sodass man wie über einen weich gewölbten Naturboden lief, wobei das Gefälle ein bestimmtes spielerisches Tempo erzeugte, das einen leichten tänzerischen Schritt erforderte. Ich lief diese Abkürzungen mit einem kleinen Mädchen, das ich fragte, ob diese Art, die Treppe hinab zu laufen, nicht zu schwierig für es sei. Sie konnte es aber sehr gut und es machte ihr keine Schwierigkeiten. Auch die kleinen Zwischentreppen zwischen den schöngerundeten eisernen Geländern konnte man gleitend, ohne die Stufen zu berühren, hinabgleiten, indem man mit den Händen auf den Geländerstangen hinabrutschte oder -schwebte. Im Stil war das grosszügige Gebäude wohl aus dem vorigen Jahrhundert oder der Zeit um die Jahrhundertwende. Ich fühlte mich sehr wohl darin und in der Stadt, die die Elemente verschiedenen Städte meines Leben enthielt. Es gab auch sehr schöne schmiedeeiserne Vezierungen in dem Treppenhaus, die mit dem alten Gestein harmonierten. (330 words)

Er sprach mit jemand an der Tür, der dann hinausging. Heidegger lehnte sich kurz an den Türbalken, als ob er erschöpft wäre. Ich hatte schon Sorgen, es könnte ihm irgendwie nicht wohl sein. Dann kam er aber wieder zu einer Art Bürotresen, an dem ich stand und der vor der Tür zu seinem Zimmer war. Ich begrüsste ihn, sagte "Guten Tag" und hob leicht die Hand, um sie ihm reichen zu können, falls er mich begrüssen wolle. Die andere Hand hatte ich irgendwie unter der Jacke und musste sie etwas mühsam hervorziehen. Er sagte etwas auf schweizerdeutsch, das ich aber nicht verstand. Es klang wie "Komme sie au gli vor" oder so ähnlich. Ich sagte "Das habe ich jetzt nicht verstanden, obwohl ich schon so lange in der Schweiz bin". Er sagte" Ganz einfach" und hub dann zu einer Erklärung an, was der Satz bedeute, und ich erwachte. (167 words)

Helfer sind hineingestiegen, um sie herunter zu holen. Am Schluss sind alle Kinder unversehrt am Boden und die Helfer decken sie mit Wolldecken zu, damit sie sich erholen. - Vorher andere Szene: Ich habe Sehnsucht nach Roggow und Leute raten mir, das irgendwie zu zeigen, damit ich wieder dort hinkomme.

Wir konnten einige Buchstaben aber nicht richtig lesen. Offenbar waren sie auf Neugriechisch anders als auf Altgriechisch. - Andere Szene: Ich fuhr in Zürich durch eine breite dreibahnige Einbahnstrasse, in der man aber den Radfahrerverkehr auch in der Gegenrichtung geführt hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2676 (1993-06-06 - Zürich)Ich hatte Gesprächsfilme über Hölderlin und anderes behandelt und auch abschreiben lassen. Aus den mit der Hand darauf gekritzelten Daten hatte Emme geschlossen, dass sie heute, das heisst heute in dem Traum, abgeholt würden und dass auch heute Leute zur Untersuchung kämen. Das Abholungsdatum war aber ein anderes und statt zur Untersuchung kamen Leute zu einem Gespräch, wo sie wohl Fragen zu den Filmen oder etwas anderem stellen wollten. Ich sagte, ich könne das Gespräch ja bald beenden, weil wir schon müde waren. Es sollte im Fernsehzimmer stattfinden. Inzwischen hatte Dieter Sträuli, der auch da war, die Kartons mit den Abschriften, es waren grosse Kartons, schon begonnen rauszustellen. Er nahm aber an, dass sie für das Altpapier seien, und fuhr sie auf einem kleinen Transportkarren gerade über die Strasse, weil auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite der Strasse schon Atltpapier für die Abholung gestapelt war. Ich rief ihn zurück, aber es dauerte eine Weile, bis er mich hörte und mit den Kartons umkehrte. Ich beschloss, ihn damit erst einmal auf die Rampe vor dem Haus fahren zu lassen und dann nachzudenken, was nun damit geschehen sollte. Ich überlegte, dass ich sie vielleicht in der Garage, wo wir viele Sachen haben und die wir als Abstekllkammer benutzen, aufheben könne, und erwachte. Die Daten auf den Filmabschriften, die ich dort hingekritzelt hatte, hatte ich vorher entziffert. Sie bezogen sich, glaube ich, auf eine vergangene Zeit, die aber in dem Traum irgendwie Gegenwart war. (239 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2681 (1993-06-09 - Zürich)Ich war in Moskau und wollte mit der Bahn von einem Vorort in die Stadt zurückfahren. Zunächst kam ein langer Zug, der aber durchfuhr. Es war ein Güterzug. Ich ging etwas weiter auf dem Bahnsteig in Richtung Mitte, da ich ziemlich an der Spitze stand und annahm, dass dort vielleicht die erste Klasse sein könne. Da kam schon der Zug und eine Lautsprecherstimme sagte auch etwas von Moskau Hauptbahnhof. Der Zug war relativ kurz, und so stand ich nun schon vor dem letzten Wagen. Auf dem standen zwei Orte, aber nicht Hauptbahnhof. Ich überlegte, dass er vielleicht vorher abgehängt würde, und beschloss, schnell zum nächsten Wagen vorzugehen. Als ich dort ankam, setzte sich der Zug schon wieder in Bewegung. Er hatte nur ziemlich kurz gehalten. Da ich nicht wusste, wann der nächste kam, beschloss ich aufzuspringen. Es war ein Zug mit altmodischen, nicht automatischen Türen, sodass das ging. Ich kam auch richtig auf das Trittbrett, bemerkte aber, dass die Tür nur einen Spalt offen war. Es war eine zweiflügelige Schiebetür. So schob ich sie ganz offen, während der Zug schon langsam schneller fuhr. Zwei Insassen, darunter eine Frau in einer Art Schwesterntracht, kamen von innen zur Hilfe. Aber auch ganz aufgeschoben war die Tür so schmal, dass ich nur mit Mühe mit dem Kopf hindurchgekommen wäre, wenn ich diesen etwas auf die Seite gedreht hätte. Ich bekam Angst, während der Fahrt in der Tür stecken zu bleiben und nicht ganz hineizukommen. Andererseits konnte ich nicht mehr abspringen.Ich überlegte, dass ein Sprichwort sagt, dass da wo man mit dem Kopf hindurchkommt, man auch ganz hindurch kommt, wohl auch vom Vorbild der Geburt ausgehend. Ich stellte mir vor, wie es wäre,wenn ich so im fahrenden Zug, den Kopf schon drinnen, in der Tür stecken würde und der übrige Leib nach draussen ragen würde. Die Frau in Schwesterntracht schickte sich an, mich hinein zu ziehen, aber ich war nicht sicher, ob sie dazu genügend Kraft hätte. Wenn sie loslassen würde, würde ich zweifellos hinausstürzen, andererseits gab es keine andere Lösung. Ich erwachte sehr beunruhigt. (341 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2682 (1993-06-09 - Zürich)Ich bin mit einem Mann am Fenster eines Hauses, aus dem er später, wohl in der Nacht, Flugblätter oder etwas ähnliches anlässlich eines Festes abwerfen will, das dann stattfinden wird. Er steht dabei auf der Fensterbank und ich habe Angst, dass er herabstürzen könnte. Ich war auch mit Kindern schon früher auf dieser Fensterbank, sorgte aber dann immer dafür, dass sie sich festhielten. Hier aber traute ich mich nicht, weil es ja ein junger Mann, also ein Erwachsener war. Ich schloss zeitweise die Augen und sagte mir: Es geht mich nichts an. Dann aber wurde meine Sorge und die Angst, dass er herabfallen könne, weil er dicht am Rand stand und sich lebhaft bewegte, doch sehr gross, und ich erwachte mit einem Schrei, den Emme hörte und fragte: "Was ist?" Ich antwortete "Traum" und beschloss, den Traum aufzuschreiben. Ich begann, ihn kurz zu memorieren, schlief dabei aber wieder ein und träumte nun, dass ich den Traum aufschriebe. Schliesslich erwachte ich ein zweites mal und merkte nun, dass das ganze Aufschreiben nur geträumt war. (173 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2683 (1993-06-10 - Zürich)Eine Oberbewohnerin hatte allerlei Abfälle und Gerümpel, die sie mich für sie zu entfernen bat. Das etwas dauerhaftere Gerümpel solle ich doch einfach die Kleine Böschung hinter der nächsten Häuserzeile hinunterwerfen, wie es die dortigen Anwohner auch taten. Die anderen Abfälle sollte ich irgendwo hin bringen. wo sie wohl irgendwie versorgt wurden. Ich wachte in Gedanken über diese etwas problematischen Methoden auf und mit dem Gedanken, dass ich nichts diese Böschung hinunterwerfen wollte, wo schon viel Gerümpel herum lag. (79 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2684 (1993-06-10 - Zürich)Wir wurden vom Wohnungsamt aus unserer Wohnung ausgewiesen, weil sie für uns zu gross sei, und bekamen eine Wohnung in der Stadt zugewiesen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2685 (1993-06-11 - Zürich)Musikaufführung in einer Institution, wo ich auch mit zu spielen habe. Ich habe ein schnarrenartiges Geräusch zu machen, das die Musik an bestimmten Stellen wie ein Trommelwirbel begleitet. Aber es steht nirgends, wann ich das zu machen habe. So mache ich es an mir passend scheinenden Stellen. Und ebenso ist mir nicht bekannt, wie lange und wie oft ich das Geräusch zu machen habe. So passe ich mich also irgendwie dem Rhythmus der Musik an. Dabei schaue ich den Komponisten an, der auch mitspielte oder dirigiert, aber er gibt mir auch kein Zeichen, sondern schaut mich nur aufmerksam an. Offenbar gehört es zu der Komposition, dass ich das selbst zu entscheiden habe. (112 words)

Es war gleichsam eine Verbindung zwischen zwei Welten, denn das unterirdische Gelass stand irgendwie in Verbindung mit anderen Räumen, gleichsam einer unterirdischen Welt. Ich erklärte gerade jemand unten diesen Weg und sagte zu ihm: "Sie können hier hoch kriechen, denn landen Sie auf meiner Couch". Es war eine sehr praktische und sinnreiche Verbindung. Es gab dann noch irgendwie eine Fortsetzung, wo man in der oberen Welt wie in einem Bahnhof, wo man ankommt eine Tageskarte für die Verkehrsbetriebe lösen konnte (116 words)

Ich wollte auf eine Toilette, doch wo ich hinging, die Toiletten waren in Bädern, war schon jemand, der dort etwas wusch, oder ähnliches. Das Ganze war wohl auf Reisen und ich kam irgendwie mit der Zeit nicht zurecht in den alltäglichen Verrichtungen und fühlte mich gehetzt. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2690 (1993-06-15 - Zürich)"Verlorenes Pflanzenfett und Strauss wird von Uslar und sowieso ersetzt". Dieser Satz war in einer Deklaration enthalten, die eine Art Kontrolleur in einer uralten Strassenbahn vorlas oder vortrug. Jemand hatte die Bahn offenbar nicht ganz richtig gewartet und der Kontrolleur fand, dass wir, ich glaube Emme und ich, dafür verantwortlich waren. Es handelte sich offenbar um Fett, mit dem der Motor geschmiert war, nämlich Pflanzenfett und Straussenfett. Wir beschlossen, einfach nicht zu reagieren, weil es nur Komplikationen gegeben hätte und so, wenn wir nichts täten, die merkwürdige Deklaration vergessen würde und ohne Folgen bliebe. Während er redete, brach auch noch ein Riemen ab, den ich in der Hand hatte, der aber anscheinend keine Funktion mehr hatte. Es war ein gelochter Lederriemen, wie es ihn früher in ganz alten Fahrzeugen an den Fenstern gab, deren Öffnungsgrad man damit einstellen konnte. Den zweiten Namen in der Deklaration habe ich vergessen. Es muss ja eigentlich ein Name gewesen sein, der sich auf Emme bezog. Es war aber nicht ihr Mädchenname Möss, sondern ein zweisilbiger Name. Den abgebrochenen Lederriemen steckte ich irgendwie so hinein, dass er nicht herabhing. (184 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2691 (1993-06-16 - Zürich)Bäume in einer Stadt, wobei man verschiedene unterscheiden konnte, Birken und andere. Ich betrachtete sie. Ich hatte eine langes Telephongespräch mit jemand, der dann schliesslich auch kam. Das Gespräch war durch einen Zufall zustande gekommen, weil ich mich verwählt hatte und wir dann miteinander einige Worte wechselten, woraus ein ganz langes Gespräch wurde. Ich hatte dabei die ganze Zeit die Bäume am Strassenrand betrachtet, darunter eine wunderschöne Pappel. Als der Mann mit dem Auto kam, sagte ich zu ihm, dass das ein wunderschöner Baum sei. Dem stimmte er zu. Ich sagte ihm, dass ich diesen Baum die ganze Zeit betrachtet habe, während wir miteinander telephoniert hätten. Ich erwachte und brauchte einige Zeit, bis mir klar wurde, dass ich geträumt hatte. Ich hatte während des ganzen Telephongesprächs dort auf der Strasse auf einem Sitz oder Stuhl gesessen. Der Mann fuhr von hinten heran und ich wendete auch beim Weitersprechen den Blick nicht ab von der Pappel, sodass ich sie, und zunächst nicht ihn, ansah, der herangefahren hinter mir in seinem Auto sass, (171 words)

Ich dachte, er würde vielleicht beleidigt sein. Er war aber sehrt interessiert und begeistert und nahm den Zettel mit der Zeichnung an sich und zeigte ihn jemand und war sichtlich stolz darauf. - Vor dem Graumanntraum noch andere Traumszenen, die vom Hotel und verwickelten Raumverhältnissen handelten.

Ein Leibreiztraum. - Vorher andere Szene, wo die Besatzungstruppen auch sich an Leichen zu schaffen machen, sie wohl wegräumen. Dabei scheinen sie auch jemand erschiessen zu wollen, der noch lebt.

Wir waren zu Besuch dort. - Vorher andere Szene:Unterwegs am Rande der Strasse ein Graben, an dem ich im Laufe der Zeit - ich ging oft dort - etwas geputzt hatte, wobei aber immer die Gefahr war, dass sich der Graben dabei zuschüttete. So war er an einer Stelle mit Erde schon überdeckt. Das Wasser floss aber darunter weiter. An einer anderen war Gras angehäuft. Emme wollte das irgendwie in Ordnung bringen, dabei wäre es aber hinein gefallen und hätte den Wasserfluss verstopft. Ich sagte, sie solle es lassen. - In einer anderen Szene fuhr ein kleines Kind im Alter von Tobias einen Autobus auf der Strasse. Es sass am Steuer. Ich sagte zu Emme, dass er das oft täte. Wir waren aber sehr beunruhigt,und ich überlegte, ob man eingreifen solle. (169 words)

Der reiche Mann ist irgendwie auswärts und es wird langsam Abend. Irgendwann werden wir von der Haushälterin, als wir im Garten sind, aus Versehen ausgeschlossen. Ich drücke mehrfach auf den Klingelknopf, einen weissen Knopf neben der Glastür, bis sie schliesslich kommt und sich sehr entschuldigt. Ich sage ihr, sie möge den inzwischen zurückgekommenen Hausherrn fragen, ob er nicht den Herrn Dr. Kitsch, der noch heute weiterreisen müsste, gleich empfangen kann. Die Frau hatte übrigens um den Griff der Glastür noch zwei Kordeln oder etwas ähnliches aus Stoff geschlungen, die sie erst noch wegziehen musste, als sie die Tür aufmachte. - Dann allmähliches Erwachen.

So gab es zum Beispiel ein System, das die Durchfahrt durch eine grosse und belebte Stadt erleichterte. Man gab per Funk sein Fahrtziel bekannt und es wurde einem mitgeteilt, welche Routen und Strassenzüge dafür gerade am besten durchgängig waren. Das wurde ständig der Situation angepasst. - Irgendwann musste ich mit jemand auch für das Essen einer Gruppe sorgen, die wohl draussen arbeitete. Alles Geschirr war in einem kioskartigen, teils aus Korb geflochtenen kleinen Bau untergebracht, so zum Beispiel die Tassen in Korbschubladen, die wir aufziehen mussten. Einmal kam ein gewitterartiger Regenguss. In dem Ständchen waren wir trocken, aber ich hatte meine persönlichen Sachen draussen auf einem Haufen von anderen Sachen liegen. Dachte zuerst, mein kleiner Dreiecksbeutel, in dem ich Portemonaie, Brille und anderes habe, sei verschwunden, fand ihn aber doch wieder, als ich durch den Regen dort hin lief. - Die andere Person, mit der ich zusammenarbeitete, war ähnlich wie Belli. - Bald nach dem Regenguss wachte ich auf.

Es war offenbar etwas Wichtiges darin. Wir kamen an einem Taxi vorbei. Ich kam auf die Idee, dieses die Koffer dorthin bringen zu lassen. Die Stadt, wo die Koffer hin mussten, war Marburg. Ich stellte also die Koffer bei dem Taxifahrer ab, der wohl erstaunt war, dass ich nicht gleich einstieg, und sagte.: "Diese Koffer müssen nach Marburg, ich selbst aber nicht. Was würde es kosten, diese dahin zu bringen?" Er begann in Gedanken zu rechnen. Es war mir klar, dass es teuer sein würde, aber nicht, wie teuer es werden würde. Die Sache war wichtig, es durfte aber auch nicht unglaublich teuer sein. Er fragte noch: "Zusammen?", womit er meinte, dass beide Koffer an die selbe Adresse müssten, was ich bejahte. Während er noch weiter in Gedanken rechnete und ich gespannt auf das Ergebnis wartete, erwachte ich. (165 words)

Er hatte aber stattdessen mich das machen lassen. Sie kam die Strasse entlang, wo ich sie aus dem Glasfenster der Tür des Zimmers sah. Genau zu der verabredeten Stunde. Sie war nicht sehr verwundert, mich statt des Mannes zu sehen. Dann war Julia da. Ich umarmte sie. Meine Hände berührten ihren nackten Leib und ich dachte dabei auch, ob man dass Kind spürte, das sie zur Welt gebracht hatte. Dann war auch ihr Mann da. Es war ein anderer als ihr wirklicher Mann, was aber im Traum ganz natürlich war. Er war ganz unkompliziert und sagte, dass Julia sehr viel von mir gesprochen habe. (124 words)

Das Geländer ist aber so geführt, dass im Winkel der beiden Bretter ein Loch entsteht. Ein Kind fällt dort hinein. Ich kann es im letzten Moment am Haarschopf packen und wieder hochziehen. Ich veranlasse, dass die Brücke sofort für die vielen Nachkommenden, die am anderen Rand der Schlucht warten, gesperrt wird. Ein Mann kommt heran. Ich frage ihn: "Sind Sie der Konstrukteur der Brücke" Er nickt betroffen. Ich sage, dass diese Konstruktion keine Heldentat sei. Ich sehe, dass, wenn man ein Brett über das entstandene Loch legt, man darauf achten muss, dass dann eine Tür am Ende der Brücke nicht mehr aufgeht, und sage das. Er lächelt erhaben, dass ich ihm etwas sage, was so offensichtlich ist, hat aber doch das viel Offensichtlichere, nämlich das gefährliche Loch übersehen. - Andere Szene: Wir sind in einer neuen Wohnung. Der Briefkasten, etwas ausserhalb vor der Tür, ist so gross, dass man hineinkriechen kann, beziehungsweise, ihn leicht gebückt richtig wie einen Raum betreten kann. Die Post verkriecht sich aber, wenn sie hineingesteckt wird, in einer Ritze, wo man sie hinausziehen muss, Neben diesr Briefkastenhöhle ist die Heizung, sodass es in ihm etwas warm ist. Der Briefkasten hat auch noch einen kleinen Nebenraum, den man von innen durch eine Tür erreichen kann. Eine Frau kommt vorbei, die die Nachbarwohnung hat. Sie sagt, dass man in den Wänden, die den Ton fotrtleiten, Geräusche der Nachbarwohnungen hören kann. Ich habe dies auch schon bemerkt, besonders an einer bestimmten Stelle über dem Esstisch. Ich sage dies und stelle fest, dass sie das selbe in ihrer Wohnung auch schon bemerkt hat. Die Wohnungen sind sehr grosszügig, wie die Grösse des Briefkastens zeigt, haben aber Nachteile. - Vorher noch andere Szene: Ich will etwas auf den Computer schreiben.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2707 (1993-06-30 - Zürich)Wir waren umgezogen und hatten einen einzigen grossen Raum, in dem alles untergebracht werden musste, alle Funktionen unterzubringen waren. Ich machte darum einen grossen Raumteiler aus Regalen. So entstanden zwei aber relativ schmale Räume. Im linken brachte ich die Küche unter, die nun relativ gross war. Aber es sah unbefriedigend aus. Emme, die ich danach fragte, antwortete zunächst ausweichend, um mich nicht zu enttäuschen, aber man merkte, dass es ihr so auch nicht gefiel. Ich räumnte darum die Regale in der Mitte wieder weg. Es entstand ein grosser Raum, was nun befreiend wirkte, und ich versuchte, ihm durch Verschieben der restlichen Regale, die jetzt an den Wänden standen, Harmonie zu geben. So konnte man auch wieder schöne Sachen hineinstellen. Nun kam Her Herzka zu Besuch und machte etwas zu essen. Es waren Glasteller, auf denen er Verschiedenes in schönen Farben arrangiert hatte, was man essen konnte. Er begann nun eine Geschichte zu erzählen, wobei die Teller bestimmte Personen darstellten, sagte zum Beispiel: Dies ist sowieso. An einer Stelle, wo der Teller in seinen Farben und seiner Anordnung eigentlich nicht zu der Person passte, die er darstellen sollte, sagte ich das. Herzka begann nun, die Tomaten aus diesem Teller heraus zu nehmen und legte sie in einen anderen Teller und sagte: "Jetzt ist er es." Überhaupt veränderte er grosszügig die Teller während des Erzählens, damit sie besser zu den erzählten Figuren passten, schüttete dabei Sachen zusammen und andere auseinander, sodass die Gefahr bestand, dass alle Speisen miteinander vermischt wurden und auch die Farben sich mischten. Er war dabei ganz in seine lebendige Erzählung vertieft, in der alle Teller irgendwelche Leute oder Figuren darstellten. (272 words)

Ich bin von dem, Stress in der letzten Zeit vor der Pensionierung, wo so viel zu tun war, immer noch so erschöpft, dass mir die Entscheidungen, welche ja beim Kofferpacken immer nötig sind, sehr schwer fallen, und sage das. Emme bedauert mich ganz liebevoll, und vor allem, sie beginnt einfach, meine Sachen in den Koffer zu packen. Ich brauch so bloss bei einigen Sachen zu sagen, dass sie in die Reisetasche müssen, und sie gibt mir diese. Auf diese Weise geht es weiter und entsteht nicht die Gefahr, dass man bei der ganzen Sache einfach stecken bleibt, was ja auch nicht geht, weil der Reisetermin einfach feststeht und herannaht. Ich freue mich in Gedanken darauf, dass unsere Betten zu Hause wieder nebeneinander stehen, während sie hier im Hotel getrennt standen. (173 words)

Zum Teil waren es auch grössere zusammenhängende Gebilde, wie grosse Drachen. Allmählich bekam ich Routine dabei und wusste, wie ich in die Tiere hineinfassen musste. Es waren grössere Hohlgebilde.

Dann aber wird ein Ersatzzug eingesetzt, der auf dem selben Bahnsteig, nur eine Etage tiefer, abfahren soll. Wir gehen in seine Richtung. Dann müssen wir aber noch einmal ein Stück durch die Unterführung zurück und eine Treppe hoch, um etwas nachzusehen. Dabei nehme ich nur den grossen Koffer mit und lasse zwei kleinere in der Unterführung stehen. Die Zeit ist jetzt knapp geworden. Man hört den Zug schon einfahren, weiss nicht, ob es der richtige ist oder der Ersatzzug. Als wir zurückkommen in die Unterführung sind die beiden da zurückgelassenen Koffer weg. Ich erwache mit einem Schrei. Dabei fällt mir aber noch im Erwachen ein, dass die Koffer wahrscheinlich in der selben Unterführung aber eine Etage tiefer stehen, weil da ja auch der Ertsatzzug abfahren sollte. Ich weiss nicht, ob man meinen Schrei auch im Wachen hören konnte, das heisst ob Emme ihn gehört hat. Ich höre sie aber nach dem Erwachen fest schlafen. (168 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2713 (1993-07-04 - Zürich)In einer Buchhandlung, wo man in aller Ruhe in den Büchern lesen und auch Teile von Büchern essen konnte. Ich hatte mir mein Buch Traum als Welt geben lassen und auch eine Stück davon gegessen. Es schmeckte sehr schön wie eine saftige Birne, die weich und angenehm und aromatisch im Mund war. Die Buchhändlerin sagte, man könne aufgeschnittene Bücher, die hier real wie aufgeschnittene Birnen waren, auch wieder zusammendrücken, dann würden sie manchmal wieder völlig intakt. Im übrigen war diese Möglichkeit, Teile der Bücher zu essen, offenbar ein Kundendienst, der sich für die Buchhandlung lohnte. Ich überlegte noch, was sie wohl mit den Restbüchern machen. In einer anderen Szene des Traums konnte man auf Klavieren, das heisst auf Flügeln, die elegant nebeneinander standen, liegen, was auch viele Leute taten. Auch ich lag so auf einem Flügel. Es war eine Art Gesellschaft oder Party, bei der es sehr elegant war. Alles war sehr gelassen und es war sehr befriedigend, auf dem Flügel zu liegen. - Ich konnte in der letzten Zeit Sachen oft nicht finden, weil ich sie verlegt hatte, aber am gewohnten Platz suchte, und dachte dann, ich hätte sie verloren. Emme ist das schon gewohnt und sagt dann, dass ich sie bestimmt noch finden würde, was in der letzten Zeit auch immer gestimmt hat. So hier im Traum die Koffer auch an einem analogen Platz, nur eine Etage tiefer. (230 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2714 (1993-07-05 - Zürich)Ich kam in einen Zeitkonflikt, weil ich für morgenfrüh aus Versehen zwei Sachen gleichzeitig ausgemacht hatte. Einerseits wollte jemand von einem Geschäft kommen und mich abholen, weil wir irgendwo etwas holen mussten. Andererseits wollte Schelling um dieselbe Zeit kommen, weil wir irgendetwas erledigen mussten. Ich sprach nun mit jemand vom Institut, von meinen früheren Mitarbeitern, darüber und sagte: "Am einfachsten ist es wohl, den Schelling abzubestellen" Er antwortete: "Das würde ich nicht tun. Du kannst dem doch auf keinen Fall Vorschriften machen. Ich mache mir sowieso Sorgen". Ich fragte, worüber er sich in Bezug auf ihn Sorgen mache. Er antwortete: "Ich fürchte, Boss wird die Psychopathologie übernehmen". Es war in der Gesprächssituation so, dass das anscheinend eine Aufgabe war, die eigentlich Schelling übernehmen sollte und wollte. Ich wendete ein, dass ich mir nicht vorstellen könnte, dass die Psychiater wollen würden, dass Boss die Psychopathologie übernehmen würde. Mein Zeitproblem aber war nun immer noch nicht gelöst. Ich überlegte, ob ich es einfach drauf ankommen lassen sollte und hoffen, dass es zeitlich doch hinkommen würde. Davon aber riet mein Gesprächspartner ab, weil ihm klar war, dass die Zeit nicht für beides reichen könne. Ich grübelte weiter darüber nach und erwachte, brauchte aber noch eine gewisse Zeit, bis ich realisiert hatte, dass beide Pflichten nur geträumt waren und es also in Wirklichkeit dieses Zeitproblem gar nicht gab.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2716 (1993-07-07 - Zürich)Wir fuhren im Auto spazieren, Emme und Bille und ich. Später war es ein Spaziergang mit zwei anderen Männern. Einer war ein Gymnasialdirektor, der andere der Professor Bräutigam. Dann kam noch ein anderer Mann dazu, der mich ins Gespräch zog, den Arm um meinen Rücken legte und von Gedichten sprach, die er mir in einem Brief geschrieben hatte, Zitate von berühmten Dichtern. Ich konnte mich nicht an alles erinnern, was er geschrieben hatte und in seiner Rede selbstverständlich voraussetzte. Im Gehen schlug ein Gegenstand an mein Knie, als ob er einen Säbel umgeschnallt hätte. Ich sagte im Scherz, es sei wie bei einem Spaziergang mit dem Vater, der einen Säbel trage. Er zeigte eine Art Holzschwert oder ähnliches, einen geschnitzten Gegenstand, den er am Gürtel hängen hatte. Zuletzt Autofahrt mit Emme und Bille. Emme sagte, es sei besser, wenn wir allein, Bille, sie und ich, spazieren gingen, weil die anderen nicht englisch könnten und vieles, was man sagte, nicht verstünden. Ich sass eine Zeitlang allein in dem Auto, das zu rollen begann. Ich konnte nicht autofahren und überlegte, wo ich mit dem Fuss die Bremse finden und auf diese treten könne, damit ich das Auto zum Stehen brächte. (198 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2719 (1993-07-09 - Zürich)Ich war mit einer Gruppe unterwegs und hatte Schwierigkeiten, mit der Zeit zurecht zu kommen. Es ging um den Aufbruch zu einer Reise. Zunächst brauchte ich zu viel Zeit zur Auswahl der mitzunehmenden Sachen, oder konnte sie nicht finden. So fand ich zum Beispiel nicht eine Turn- oder Sommerhose, die noch in den Koffer sollte. Als schliesslich alles beisammen war, waren die anderen schon in Richtung zu dem Fahrzeug losgegangen, das uns mitnehmen sollte. Aber einer hatte ganz unauffällig auf mich gewartet, was ich ganz rührend fand. Dann mussten wir, um zu dem Fahrzeug oder Zug zu kommen, das nach einem Fahrplan abfuhr, durch einen langen, teils sehr nassen und mit Pfützen ausgefüllten Weg laufen, in denen man auszurutschen drohte. Es war jetzt eine ganze Reihe von Leuten, die in Gefahr waren, zu spät zu kommen. Um dem Wasser auszuweichen, liefen einige, auch ich, neben dem Weg auf dem Acker. Dabei kamen wir aber auf dem Acker in eine Gegend, die tiefer lag, als der Weg, und mussten nun eine rutschige Böschung hoch laufen, wobei es schwierig war, über einen kleinen Wall auf den Weg zurück zu kommen. Die Kräfte reichten fast nicht mehr, um den Wall zu überwinden. Dann sah ich aber, wie jemand, eine Frau, durch ein Loch in diesem Wall in den Weg zurücksteigen konnte, und ging ihr nach und erwachte. - Vorher andere Traumszene: Hier war es ein Um die Wette Fahren mit schweren Lastautos. Ich sass in einem, dessen Fahrer sehr kühn war, sodass es immer fast zu Zusammenstösesn kam. Es ging aber gut. Die schweren Autos fuhren mit grosser Geschwindigkeit eine steile Strasse hinab und um eine Kurve. (274 words)

Man kann die Teile des Schlosses nicht richtig zur Deckung bringen. Es ist die Tür eines Wandschrankes, ähnlich der Tür eines Wandschrankes im Psychologischen Institut in der obersten Etage neben meinem Zimmer, aber nicht weiss gestrichen, sondern aus altem Holz. Ursprünglich war der Mann allein darum bemüht, hatte aber Schwierigkeiten, wegen seiner Kleinwüchsigkeit. Ich kam ihm zur Hilfe und presste die Tür oben zusammen beziehungsweise gegen den Rahmen, bemerkte schliesslich ganz oben einen Riegel, den man zuschieben und sie dadurch stabilisieren konnte. Ich sagte: Wenn wir sie zukriegen, wird sie wahrscheinlich niemand wieder aufkriegen. (125 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2723 (1993-07-12 - Zürich)Ich hatte viele kleine Zinn- oder Bleifiguren - es waren wohl hauptsächlich Tiere - auf einem kleinen Tisch aufgebaut, der in einer öffentlichen Anlage am Wegrand auf dem Rasen stand. Der Tisch glich praktisch ganz unserem Kinderklapptisch und auf ihm lag ein rotes Tuch, eine rote Decke, auf der die Figuren aufgestellt waren. Ich musste diese nun zusammenpacken, weil ich abreiste. Ich hatte vorher schon viele andere Sachen, die ich dort hatte, in Kartons zusammengepackt, die ich wiederum alle in einem grossen flachen Karton verstaute, der so gross war, dass man ihn wohl gerade noch unter dem Arm tragen konnte. Um diesen grossen Karton hatte ich eine Kordel gezogen und geknotet. Die Kordel war aber noch zu weit, und ich musste den Knoten wieder öffnen und neu anziehen. Ein vorbeikommender Mann half mir rührend dabei. Es waren alles Kartons, die ich sowieso gerade hatte. Nun musste ich noch einen Karton für die vielen kleinen Figuren auf dem Klapptischchen suchen. Ich wollte gerade einige Schritte in die Wiese gehen, wo ein solcher Karton bei anderen Sachen lag, als ein ziemlich töricht aussehendes und sich verhaltendes Mädchen kam und sich anschickte, das rote Tuch einfach unter den Figuren weg zu ziehen, sodass sie alle herabgefallen wären. Ich fragte sie, was sie denn tue, und sie sagte, es sei ihr Tuch und sie brauche es jetzt. Ich sagte, sie solle doch einen Moment warten, bis ich die Figuren in einen Karton gepackt hätte. Sie sagte irgendetwas Dummes und Freches und ich antwortete kritisch darauf, während ich die paar Schritte in die Wiese ging, um den Karton zu holen. Da zog sie die rote Decke einfach weg und alle Figuren begannen herab zu fallen. Ich war furchtbar wütend und wachte empört auf, wonach die Wut noch eine Weile anhielt. (295 words)

Es zog sich aber lange hin und sollte schliesslich in der Nacht um zwei stattfinden. Als es so weit war, sagte Emme: "So, jetzt gehen wir und holen den Pudel". Ich war enttäuscht und empört, denn ich hatte mich sehr auf die Bilder gefreut. Ich sagte das. Emme erklärte, es wäre nass und der Pudel hätte es feucht in seinem Zelt. Ich war mir nicht sicher, ob der Pudel, der in einem Zelt untergebracht war, es wirklich nass haben würde, und stellte mir vor, wir würden ihn dort friedlich schlafend finden. (109 words)

Später erfuhr ich, dass ein Paar das Musilzitat gefunden hatte, das auch unseren Esstisch konstruiert hatte, den Tisch, den wir bei Behr in Stuttgart gekauft hatten. Später trat die Frau auch selber auf. Sie war nackt und wunderschön. Ich streichelte mit der Hand über ihr nacktes Gesäss und drückte den Daumen in die Spalte und betrachtete ihren nackten Rücken.

Ich hatte ein Auto geliehen, einen Volkswagen, mit dem auch einiges nicht geklappt hatte, und jetzt konnte ich ihn nicht finden, wusste nicht, wo ich ihn abgestellt hatte. Dann sah ich ihn am Ende eines Platzes stehen und Jugendliche hatten sich an ihn herangemacht, hatten ihn hinten aufgeklappt und wollten ihn ausräumen. Ich näherte mich schnell und überlegte, was ich mit ihnen tun sollte. Dann hatte ich Schulden gemacht. Jemand riet mir, aufzuhören und die Verluste in Kauf zu nehmen.

In einer Szene mussten wir umziehen und hatten schon grosse Teile der Sachen verpackt. In einer anderen ging es in einem Gespräch um berühmte Designer. Ich war erstaunt, wie viele Namen mir da einfielen. Darunter war zum Beispiel Charles Eams, aber auch Karl Löwith kam dabei vor, der Dinge entworfen hatte, und der Mann, der die Braun-Radios gestaltet hat. In einer anderen Szene erlebte ich eine Art Fest oder Party im Freien, die jemand filmte, oder die ein Film war, oder für einen Film entworfen. Eine laute Kapelle war dabei und sehr vielfältige Szenen, die teils sehr gut getroffen waren, aber vielleicht etwas zu wenig gerafft. Es war aber eine langes Fest, an dem man unmittelbar teilhatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2730 (1993-07-16 - Freiburg)Heute Nacht mehrfach Träume vom Dalai Lama. Es war eine grosse Gesellschaft oder Gruppe versammelt, und er nahm daran teil. Er äusserte immer wieder sehr philosophische und sehr kluge Ideen. Dann wieder aber ging er einfach durch die Luft - ganz wirklich - und wanderte durch ein Märchenland. - Er selber wunderte sich nicht darüber, dass er das konnte, und die anderen auch nicht. Zuletzt war wieder ein langes, sehr philosophisches Gespräch. Ich hatte gerade beschlossen, mich zu melden und auch etwas zu sagen, als er wieder schwebend durch die Luft davon ging und eine Märchenwelt der Pflanzen um ihn entstand. Man sah ihn, sich entfernend, kleiner werden. Es war jetzt wie in einem Film. Danach erzählte Emme, dass sie als Kind auch so etwas erlebt habe. Vor allem in der Nacht. Dieses eigene zauberhafte Reich nahm dann einen bestimmten Teil des Fussbodens ein, das Terrain darum herum war gleichsam abgeblendet, sodass sie, zum Beispiel, die Rillen zwischen den Brettern des Fussbodens nicht sah. - Später, und am Tag, waren diese dann wieder da und es war die normale Realität. - Nachtrag abends: In einer anderen Szene des Traums legten wir uns schlafen. Da nicht so viele Betten wie Personen da waren, legte der Dalai Lama sich neben mich auf das Bett. Er war sehr unkompliziert und natürlich, wie man ihn auch am Fernsehen oft gesehen hat, und das Bild von ihm und seinem Auftreten und Verhalten war auch nach dem Erwachen noch sehr deutlich.

Das sei ein Zeichen, dass der Kunde auffallend viel kaputt macht. Ich erwachte sehr ärgerlich mit dem Gedanken, ihr zu sagen, sie solle mal ansehen, wann die ersten Eintragungen auf der Karte seien, wie lange ich also nie etwas kaputt gemacht hätte, und lieber den Schluss ziehen, dass die Ringe nicht in Ordnung seien. Und die Massnahme sei törricht, weil sie nur dazu führen würde, dass der Kunde bei ihnen nicht mehr einkaufen würde. (116 words)

Sie konnte schon selbständig wieder aufstehen und einige Schritte gehen. - Ich sollte für sie etwas einkaufen. Das hiess Spinatsalz, wonach sie offenbar ein starkes Bedürfnis hatte, und salzige Keks. Ich liess mir von Alli oder Emme, das weiss ich nicht mehr genau, auf alle Fälle noch sagen, wie viel Spinat ich kaufen sollte, wenn es dies Spinatsalz nicht gäbe. Es war nun schon später geworden, und ich musste mich eilen, den Einkauf zu machen, ehe die Geschäfte abends schlossen. Ich kam eine viertel Stunde vor Ladenschluss in das Geschäft. Es war dreiviertel sieben. Es gab das Spinatsalz. Die Verkäuferin sagte aber, das sei eigentlich weniger für das Essen als für den Weg dorthin: es war anscheinend zum Rohrreinigen. Ich nahm es für alle Fälle trotzdem und beschloss, auch noch Spinat zu kaufen und erwachte. Ich dachte noch, dass Emmi vielleicht einerseits ein Bedürfnis nach Salz, andererseits nach Spinat habe und so auf die Idee kam, Spinatsalz zu verlangen.

Das schien mir der richtige Weg. - Andere Szene: Ein Mann, bei dem man eine Art Kombination von Fliegen (im Sinne von: Flüge machen) und Essen kaufen konnte. - Beim Essen gab es Sandardpreise oder Preise nach Gewicht. Emme wählte für mich das letztere, und man konnte nun das Essen nach eigenem Geschmack zusammenstellen. Es war aber sehr teuer, und ich wachte deshalb mit einem unguten Gefühl auf mit der Überlegung, dass das nicht nötig sei und es besser sei, den Standardpreis zu wählen. - Vorher noch andere Szene, wobei die Operierte eine geistig Behinderte war.

Ich bin noch nach dem Erwachen sehr beunruhigt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2745 (1993-07-22 - Freiburg)Ich war mit einem Kind in einer Gegend, wo die Leute nicht alt wurden. Dort war die Graue Dame. Es war wie ein zweites, unterirdisches Reich. Die Leute blieben dort ewig jung. Wenn sie aber raus gingen in die Welt, bekamen sie ihr wahres Alter. - Es war ein See mit kleinen bungalow-artigen Häuschen dabei, am Rande des Wassers, die zu einer Universität gehörten. Die Graue Dame hatte schon vor Jahrzehnten dort gearbeitet, als ich sie dort besucht hatte, und arbeitete immer noch dort und war im damaligen Alter geblieben. Sie ging mit mir und dem Kind durch das Haus, in dem sie aber nicht immer war. Sie lebte auch in der anderen Welt, wo sie aber ebenfalls das selbe Alter behielt. Offenbar war das eine Ausnahme. Das Kind, das im Hause umhergelaufen war, kam entsetzt schreiend in den Raum und sagte: Da ist eine Frau, die glaubt, ihr Haus zu sehen. Es war sofort klar, dass die Frau, die das Kind gesehen hatte, früher in dem Haus gewohnt hatte und sozusagen in der Zeit reiste, so dass zwei Welten zusammenstiessen. Das Kind schrie jetzt der Frau Jahreszahlen zu. Man sah die Frau, die schon älter aussah, wie eine Fata Morgana in einer Wiese am Wasser vor dem Haus stehen und dieses betrachten - mit einem wallenden weissen Gewand, wie ein Gespenst - aber wirklich da. Das Kind rief die Jahreszahlen, beginnend etwa 1940, und setzte sie fort bis 1983, um der Frau damit den Verlauf der wirklichen Zeit deutlich zu machen. Bei 1983 hörte das Kind auf. Offenbar war das die Gegenwart. Die Frau nickte. Sie hatte begriffen, dass wir schon im Jahr 1983 waren und nicht in einem früheren Jahr, wie zum Beispiel 1940, dass sie also nicht in dem Haus, in dem sie früher gewohnt hatte, ihre Gegenwart und ihre Welt finden konnte. - Nachdem sie das begriffen und genickt hatte, ging sie fort. Ich war erstaunt, dass das Kind alle diese schwierigen und verwickelten Zeitverhältnisse begriffen und die Gefahr eines Zusammenstosses der Zeiten und der furchtbaren Enttäuschung begriffen hatte, in die die Frau geraten wäre,wenn das Haus für sie beim Betreten nicht mehr das Selbe gewesen wäre, - Durch das Ausrufen der Jahreszahlen konnte das Kind das abwenden.

Mit irgend jemand kam die Rede darauf und ich sagte, dass verschiedene Leute eben verschiedene Dinge gut könnten. So sei zum Beispiel mir die Idee gekommen, dass die kleine, vielleicht einen halben Meter breite und tiefe Wasserrinne schnurgerade durch den Kontinent ginge, denn wo ich sie angetroffen habe, ganz im Norden und hier im Süden, sei sie immer in die selbe Richtung gegangen. Dies müsste einen Grund haben. Ich könne mir vorstellen, dass hier zum Beispiel ein Meteor die Erde gestreift habe, oder es müsse aus irgendeinem Grund ein schnurgerader Riss in der Scholle dieses Kontinents entstanden sein. - Alle müssten die Gradlinigkeit dieses Grabens sehen können, die überall gleich ist, wo sie hinkommen, aber sie würden es nicht wahrnehmen, weil es ihnen nicht einfiele oder sie die Wahrnehmung nicht in Gedanken zusammensetzen.

Ein Blinder sammelte gebrauchte Handtücher ein. Ich führte seine Hände, um ihm das Mass des kleineren zu zeigen. Ich sagte, es sei 50 cm lang. Er meinte, das Mass, in das ich seine Hand führte, sei mehr als 50 cm, und sagte: "Was denken Sie von der Natur! 50cm. sind nur wenig." Dabei meinte er mit Natur sozusagen die Natur der Längen. - Irgendwie hingen das grosse und das kleine Handtuch und der grosse und der kleine Mercedes zusammen.

Ich sagte dann bald, dass ich jetzt in die Stadt zurück müsse, weil ich die Atmosphäre etwas bedrückend fand. Der andere, ein Verwandter, hatte aber noch dort zu tun, sodass ich sagte, ich würde mit der Strassenbahn fahren. Ich wusste aber den Weg dorthin nicht recht.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2752 (1993-07-27 - Zürich)Ein Mädchen, ich glaube eine Bekannte oder Verwandte von uns, war da, in einer Hörsaalumgebung, und sprach über den Unterschied von Medizin und Psychotherapie. Es ging um die Berufslaufbahn und sie brachte zum Ausdruck, dass, wenn es ihr um die Seele ginge, nur Psychotherapie als Beruf in Frage käme und drückte irgendwie aus, dass die übrige Medizin damit nichts zu tun habe, gleichsam seelenlose Arbeit sei. Ich unterbrach sie und sagte: "Das ist doch alles ganz anders". Sie versuchte, ihren Gedanken fest zu halten, und machte eine Bemerkung über meine Beziehung zu meiner Mutter, in der sie wohl das Seelische sah. Ich sagte: "Weisst Du, das hängt damit zusammen, wie die menschliche Arbeit, aber nicht nur das, auch die menschliche Religion und Philosophie und alles, von der menschlichen Sexualität abhängt." Bei dieser Rede wurde es im Hörsaal ganz still. Man merkte, wie es alle betraf und alle ganz konzentriert zuhörten. Was ich sagen wollte, war etwa, dass auch sachliche, scheinbar neutrale Arbeit, die sie vor allem in der körperlichen Medizin sah, davon abhängt und nicht nur seelische Analysen. Ich überlegte, wie ich den Gedanken weiter formulieren sollte und war im Begriff, etwa zu sagen, dass Freud sehr viel davon gesehen habe, tiefer, als es in seiner Theorie zum Ausdruck komme, als ich erwachte.

Es ist aber eine Kleidung, die ich in relativ legèrer Weise anzuhaben gewohnt bin. Graumann lehnt an der Wand. Ich erkenne ihn nicht sofort ganz sicher, gehe aber auf ihn zu und sehe an seiner für ihn typischen verhaltenen aber aufmerksamen Reaktion, in der er lächelnd da steht, dass er es ist. Wir reichen uns die Hand und ich sage "Guten Tag, Herr Graumann". Er sagt lächelnd: "Kommen Sie jetzt mit dem Ding?" Ich antwortete: "Ja, das könnt ich ja machen". Das "Ding" ist ein Tonaufnahmegerät, mit dem ich Gespräche aufnehme und das ich auf dem letzten Kongress, wo wir uns trafen, dabei hatte. Es ist ein sehr altmodisches aber sehr gut funktionierendes Gerät, ein kleiner zylindrischer Metallkörper mit zwei antennenartigen Armen, an denen weisses Tuch herabhängt. Ich habe es bei meinen Versuchen, ähnlich wie den Gesprächsfilmen, stets verwendet. Die Gänge der Universität sind teils aus Ziegeln gemauert, teils grau verputzt. Graumann muss das amüsante Gerät zur Tonaufnahme sehr beschäftigt haben. (196 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2754 (1993-07-28 - Zürich)Ein Junge aus der Verwandtschaft, mit dem ich allein zu Hause war. Die übrige Familie war wohl verreist. Er war ein eher unruhiges Kind gewesen, war aber jetzt in ein sehr nettes Alter gekommen, hatte sich gestreckt und war ein freundlicher, sehr aufmerksamer Junge, mit dem man sich gut unterhalten konnte und der schon selbständig handeln konnte, sodass man sich um ihn keine Sorgen machen musste. Dann wechselte die Szene in der Art, dass es jetzt die heranwachsende Tina war, mit der ich zusammen war. Es war sozusagen die Fortsetzung der vorherigen Szene. Auch sie hatte sich gewandelt, war grösser geworden, vom Kind zu einem jungen Mädchen. Wir gingen durch die Strasse, es war eine Art Dorfstrasse, und unterhielten uns. Jetzt hatte sich erneut die Szene gewandelt. Ich stand unten am Fuss der Strasse, die auf ein Haus zuführte. Tina, die jetzt im gegenwärtigen erwachsenen Alter war, sass auf einem Rollbrett und fuhr mit ständig sich steigernder Geschwindigkeit den Berg hinunter. Es war klar, dass sie vor der Hauswand, neben der ich stand, nicht mehr hätte bremsen können und auf diese geprallt wäre. Sie konnte aber das Brett so steuern, dass sie jetzt nicht mehr auf diese Wand, sondern auf einen hölzernen Gartenzaun daneben zuraste. Auch auf diesen zu fahren, hätte aber zu einem Unfall geführt. Sie hob sich mit dem Rollbrett in die Luft, wie es die Rollbrettfahrer ja oft im Stehen tun, und landete, mit einem grossen Schwung den Zaun überfliegend, in einem dichtbewachsenen Garten dahinter. Ich hörte, wie sie aufstand und weiterging, um aus dem Garten herauszukommen, und erwachte. Der ganze Vorgang war so schnell gegangen, dass ich kaum Zeit gehabt hatte, mich aufzuregen, sondern nur gerade die Gefahr begreifen konnte, als diese auch schon vorüber war. (290 words)

Einzelne Zylinder waren auch geteilt, sodass die einzelnen Abteile wie hochkantstehende Halbzylinder waren. Es sah sehr stilisiert aus und modern, aber modern wie aus den dreissiger Jahren. - Vorher andere Szene: Ich war in einem sehr altmodischen Zug. Der Fahrer sagte etwas wie "Nun wollen wir mal", was bedeutete, dass er sich anschickte, abzufahren. Ich musste aber noch aussteigen, raffte mein Gepäck zusammen und rannte zur Tür. Diese war aber mit Stricken verschlossen, weil sie nicht mehr funktionierte. Ich musste also zur hinteren Tür rennen, bei der ein Schaffner sass wie bei einer Strassenbahn und ihn bitten, diese noch kurz zu öffnen. Es war nicht klar, ob ich das vor der Abfahrt noch schaffen würde. Dann bin ich wohl zwischendurch kurz aufgewacht, ehe die nächste Szene mit dem stilisieren Zug kam. (146 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2756 (1993-07-30 - Zürich)Eine ältere schizophrene Frau, die bei uns im Haus wohnte, lief hinter uns her und stiess Morddrohungen aus. Dabei hatte sie einen Gesichtsausdruck, der mir schlagartig die Echtheit der Gefahr deutlich werden liess. Ich ergriff die Flucht und es gelang mir gerade noch, eine Tür zwischen ihr und mir abzuschliessen, die sie aber ohne Zweifel bald würde eindrücken können. Ich lief über einen halboffenen Flur in die Küche, in der Emme war - es war ein weitläufiges altes Haus in einem Park - und rief Emme zu: "Morddrohung, komm sofort, nichts vorher mehr erledigen oder anziehen". Nach kurzem Zögern begriff sie die Echtheit der Gefahr und ich zog sie hinter mir aus dem Haus heraus. Wir flohen in eine Richtung, die mir geeignet schien, durch den Park und hielten schliesslich irgendwo im Ort oder Dorf an. Ich überlegte, was nun zu tun sei, zum Beispiel die Polizei oder Ärzte rufen, und erwachte dabei. Vorher schon andere Szene, in der wir beim Weg in das Haus gefährlichen Katzen mit überlangen Krallen begegneten, wie ich sie noch nie gesehen hatte. Sie funkelten gefährlich mit den Augen und ich war froh, als wir die Tür des Hauses hinter uns geschlossen hatten. Noch vorher andere Szene, wo wir in das Haus einzogen. Wir hatten dort eine altmodische Wohnung mit irgendwie verwickelten Räumen bekommen, die uns gut gefiel. Ein Hauswart, der gute Beziehungen zu den Besitzern zu haben schien, hatte uns gesagt, dass wir die Wohnung, beziehungsweise eine Erweiterung zu dem Teil, in dem wir schon wohnten, haben könnten, und wir begannen uns dort einzurichten. Danach kamen erst die gefährlichen Szenen mit den Katzen und der Schizophrenen, aber es war das selbe Haus, jedoch in einer etwas veränderten und erweiterten Räumlichkeit. So war die vergrösserte Wohnung im obersten Stock, die Räume der Verfolgung und die Küche aber waren ebenerdig. Nach dem Erwachen war ich noch eine Weile wie gebannt von der Gefahr, ehe ich begriff, dass es sich ja um einen Traum gehandelt hatte und ich diesen nun aufschreiben müsse. (335 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2757 (1993-07-31 - Zürich)Emme gab mir ein Tonkassettengerät, mit dem ich in ein Nebenzimmer ging, um irgendetwas zu tun und gleichzeitig die Kassette zu hören. Es war Unterhaltungsmusik. Aber die Kassette klemmte. Ich zog an dem Band, das dabei einen kleinen Riss bekam. Dann nahm ich eine andere Kassette, die ein auffallend breites Band aus Stoff hatte. Auch dieses sass irgendwie fest. Als ich es hin und her spulen wollte., quoll das Band heraus in grosser Geschwindigkeit und legte sich in Schleifen auf den Tisch. Ich nahm die Kassette heraus und versuchte, es zurück zu drehen und das Band hineinzuschieben. Dabei faltete es sich in Stofflagen auseinander und bei dem Versuch, es wieder reinzubringen, zerriss alles. Ich überlegte noch im Erwachen, ob ich vielleicht die Kassette neu kaufen könne. Ich schlief dann aber wohl gleich wieder ein, und der Traum oder ein ganz ähnlicher ging weiter. Ein Mann, dem das Haus gehörte, in dem wir wohnten, spielte Kassetten vor, etwa wie ein Diskjockey. Auch das funktionierte nicht richtig. Es war eine Kassette von einer bekannten Sängerin namens Enid Blyton. Das erklärte ich einem jungen Mann, der diese Musik offenbar garnicht kannte, als wir über einen Platz gingen. Ich sagte, für diejenigen, die in dieser Musik zu Hause seien, sei das ein sehr geläufiger Name. - In einer anderen Szene war mein Bruder da. Man hörte ihn auf der anderen Seite eines Hofes, um den das Haus lag, in einem Zimmer eine Etage tiefer sehr laut über Ahnen reden und über Ahnenforschung. (248 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2759 (1993-08-02 - Zürich)Es ging um den Kauf einer bestimmten Sorte von Röschen, die die Einfassung eines Beetes markieren sollten, damit die Leute nicht darauf traten. Dabei ging aber alles schief. So musste ich einmal mich durch eine grosse Menge von Leuten in den Gängen eines doppelstöckigen Busses drängen, um am hinteren Ende des oberen Ganges an ein dort befindliches Telephon zu kommen, um eine Gärtnerei anzurufen, die die Röschen haben sollte. Dabei musste ich mein ganzes Gepäck mitnehmen, denn wir waren auf Reisen und schon am Abend vor der Abreise. Als ich schliesslich am Telephon war und den Gärtner an der anderen Seite der Leitung hatte, fiel mir plötzlich der Name der Röschen nicht mehr ein, nach denen ich ihn fragen musste. Ich sagte, ich würde schnell zu ihm kommen und versuchen, die Rosen direkt zu identifizieren. Er sagte, sie würden in zweieinhalb Minuten schliessen. Ich sagte, ich wolle es trotzdem versuchen. Er sagte seinen Namen, damit ich nach ihm fragen könne, sein Name sei Speck. Ich wühlte mich wieder durch die Menschenmenge des Busses und stieg aus, um zu dem Gärtner zu gehen, da merkte ich, dass ich mein Hauptgepäckstück, eine Tragetasche mit meinen wichtigsten Sachen, nicht mehr bei mir hatte. Nun war es nicht mehr zu schaffen, denn ich musste zuerst das wichtige Gepäckstück suchen. Voll Sorgen, ob ich es überhaupt finden würde, wachte ich mit einem Seufzer auf und war nach dem Erwachen noch eine Weile sehr besorgt und fühlte dann einen grossen Widerstand, diesen Traum aufzuschreiben, den ich als besonders sinnlos empfand.

Später schreibe ich die Rede, die ich mitgeschrieben habe, auf dem Computer ab.

Eine Chirurgin spielt eine Rolle und eine Sammlung von Gegenständen eigenartiger Form oder Materie. Es ist wohl Krieg, aber zuletzt eher das Ende dieses Krieges. Soldaten beider Seiten flüchten sich ins Niemandsland, was beide Seiten zu dulden scheinen. Dann ertönt aber doch wieder anhaltendes Maschinengewehrfeuer. Wir sind in einem Raum, wo wir durch die Wände wohl sicher sind. Es scheint die chirurgische Praxis zu sein. Ein Mädchen, vielleicht eine Art Sprechstundenhilfe, oder hat sie eine verwaltende Funktion, sitzt ziemlich gelassen am Schreibtisch und macht ihre Bemerkungen zu dem offenbar mehr oder weniger gewohnten Geschehen. Ich rechne mir aus dass auch Geschosse, die etwa durchs Fenster kommen könnten, mich wohl nicht treffen können, da ich irgendwo ziemlich tief in der Nähe des Fussbodens sitze und zu den möglichen Geschossbahnen im toten Winkel. Ich wache, noch mit dem Geräusch des Maschinengewehrfeuers im Ohr, auf. (157 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2764 (1993-08-08 - Zürich)Es war Krieg oder sonst irgendwie eine ausserordentliche Situation. Emme und ich waren die Leiter einer Wohngruppe oder ähnlichen Gemeinschaft. Unsere Räume lagen diagonal zueinander. Über die anderen Räume und Sachen wurde irgendwie ein Ausnahmezustand verhängt. Alle Menschen waren in dem betreffenden Dekret als Tiere bezeichnet. Das war der dort übliche Ausdruck, Personen zu bezeichnen, weil ja alle Lebewesen, also auch wir, Tiere sind. Alle alten Kleidungsstücke, die der Gemeinschaft gehörten, wurden eingezogen, weil sie gereinigt werden sollten und stattdessen neue ausgegeben. Ich hatte zwei solche Kleidungsstücke, die mir lieb waren und die ich gerne behalten wollte - darunter einen Wollmantel, der aus angenehmem Stoff war. Jemand kam auf die Idee, die beiden Kleidungsstücke als mein Privateigentum zu bezeichnen. Dann brauchten sie nicht eingezogen werden. Zuletzt war eine Situation wie bei einem Fakultätstreffen. Die anderen standen in einem Wendeltreppenhaus, das wohl höher und tiefer gelegene Teile des Gebäudes verband, beisammen. Ich ging zwischen ihnen herab. Sie sagten zu mir, ich könne doch bei ihnen bleiben. Ich antwortete aber, dass ich nach unten steigen wollte. Ich wollte irgendwie eine Weile allein sein, oder hatte sonst einen Grund. So stieg ich in dem Wendeltreppengehäuse herab. Ich hatte dabei meinen Bademantel an. (199 words)

Wenn Besucher dort waren, konnte ich einen Vorhang vor die Glaswand ziehen. Später zeigte ich irgendwelchen Leuten dies Museum. Erst am Schluss sagte ich: "Das Zimmer nebenan, in das man durch die Glaswand kucken kann, war übrigens mein Arbeitszimmer". Sie bedauerten mich, weil sie nicht begriffen, dass es schön war, diese Gegenstände zu sehen. Wir schauten danach noch vom Flur vor den Räumen in einen Hof des alten Gebäudes, in dem sich geschichtliche Dinge in früheren Jahrhunderten abgespielt hatten. Dann sagte ich zu den Besuchern, um den Besuch von ihnen zu beenden.: "So, jetzt muss ich noch etwas tun.

Ich wusste sofort, wer es war und sagte "Ah, kommst Du, Freund Hein.". Ich ging die Stufen wieder hinauf, merkte aber, dass die Zeit nicht mehr reichte, um in die Wohnung zu gehen. Ich sagte: "Warte, ich setze mich da auf die Bank" und ging zu einer Bank vor der Tür, weil ich nicht wollte, dass ich im Tode die Treppe herunter fiele. Dann wachte ich im Traum auf und erzählte noch im Traum Emme den Traum, oder las ihn ihr vor. Als ich an die Stelle kam: "Da kam ein schwarzgekleideter Mann", sagte sie: "Ah, ein Konfirmandenanzug."- Der schwarze Anzug der Figur war übrigens enganliegend wie ein Schwimm- oder Tauchanzug oder wie ein Anzug aus einem Science-Fiction-Film und umhüllte auch wie eine Badekappe den Kopf, von dem er nur das Gesicht freiliess.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2769 (1993-08-13 - Zürich)Ich muss dringend auf die Toilette. Gleichzeitig fällt mir aber ein Traum ein, den ich aufschreiben möchte. Da komme ich in Konflikt, denn wenn ich nicht jetzt auf die Toilette gehe, die ich gerade ausfindig gemacht habe, dann ist sie nachher wieder besetzt. Wenn ich aber nicht jetzt zum Computer gehe, um den Traum aufzuschreiben, dann habe ich ihn nachher wahrscheinlich vergessen. Ich erwache dann wirklich und brauche einige Augenblicke, um das komplizierte Gewirr in Gedanken zu entwirren. Die Szene im Traum spielt sich irgendwie unterwegs ab. Ich war in einem Vortrag oder einer Veranstaltung gewesen und schon durch eine Reihe von Fluren aus dem Saal herausgegangen. Schon im Freien, merkte ich, dass ich auf die Toilette musste. Ich musste mich nun durch die Gänge gegen den Strom der herausflutenden Menschenmenge zurückarbeiten. Dabei hatte ich auch noch einen Kinderwagen zu schieben. Alle Toiletten, die ich fand, waren besetzt. Schliesslich fand ich eine, die gerade von jemand besetzt wurde, und beschloss, davor zu warten, bis der Mann wieder herauskam. Dabei fiel mir ein, dass ich geträumt hätte und den Traum aufschreiben sollte, ehe ich ihn vergässe. Das ist die Szene, mit der ich den Traumbericht oben angefangen habe. Wenn ich mir überlege, was der Traum war, den ich aufschreiben wollte, dann merke ich, dass es eben dieser Traum war, den ich jetzt wirklich aufgeschrieben habe. Ich hatte aber nicht im Traum das Gefühl, zu träumen, sondern, einen Traum gehabt zu haben. Die Szene hatte sich zuletzt insofern gewandelt, als der Gang, in dem ich zu warten hatte, wieder eine Strasse geworden war. Ich hatte den Kinderwagen, der leer war, in einen gegenüberliegenden Eingang zu einem Zimmer geschoben. Jetzt, nach der von mir aber nicht als solcher bemerkten Wandlung der Szene, stand er an einem Baum an der gegenüberliegenden Seite der Strasse, die nun wieder die Strasse vor dem Gebäude war, aus dem der Menschenstrom herausgekommen war. Der Kinderwagen war altmodisch, etwa im Stil der dreissiger Jahre und aus Korb. Ich hatte noch befürchtet, jemand könne ihn für derelinquiert halten und wegnehmen, während ich nicht da war, weil er ganz leer war. Ich stand nun, immer noch auf das Freiwerden der Toilette wartend, neben dem Wagen. Ein Mann mit einer turbanartigen Kopfbedeckung drängte sich in den schmalen Raum daneben, um in einen Spiegel zu schauen, der über mir am Stamm des Baumes hing. Es war auch noch die Räumlichkeit des Ganges, in dem ich ja wartete. Ich sagte zu ihm, dass das doch eigentlich jetzt nicht nötig sei, weil er mich sehr bedrängte bei dem Versuch, in den Spiegel zu blicken, und fügte hinzu, dass er offenbar es nicht fertig brächte, eine Sache bleiben zu lassen, die er sich gerade vorgenommen habe. Er kuckte mich halb begreifend, halb nicht verstehend an wie jemand, der gleichsam zwangshaft eine Sache ausführen musste, und ich merkte, dass es eigentlich noch ein sehr junger Mann war, der nur unter der turbanartigen Kopfbedeckung älter aussah, und fügte meinem Satz die Worte hinzu: "Damit werden Sie im Leben noch oft Schwierigkeiten haben." Er entfernte sich mit dem selben nur halb verstehenden Gesichtsausdruck, und dies war nun der Moment, wo mir klar wurde, dass ich einen Traum gehabt hätte und aufschreiben könne, dann aber in die Lage käme, dass hinterher die Toilette, auf die ich dringend musste, erneut besetzt sein könne, während umgekehrt, wenn ich zuerst darauf warten würde, ich hinterher den Traum vergessen haben würde, der schon begann in der Erinnerung zu schwinden. Vielleicht war das, was ich in diesem Moment - noch im Traum - als Traum erinnerte, die Topographie vor dem Szenenwechsel, also ganz im Inneren des Hauses, durch dessen Gänge die Menschenmenge hinaus geflutet war. Die Durchdringung der beiden Topographien - Gänge im Haus und Strasse mit Baum vor dem Haus - ist schwer zu beschreiben. Ihre Widersprüchlichkeit war mir aber im Traum nicht bewusst. Gleich war das räumliche Verhältnis des Gegenüber der Toilette auf der einen Seite des Ganges oder der Strasse, und des Ortes, wo ich den leeren Kinderwagen abgestellt hatte, auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite des Ganges, im Eingang zu einem Raum, oder der Strasse, bei einem Baum, wo aber auch noch die Topographie des engen Eingangs erhalten war, wo ich den Wagen vorher abgestellt hatte und nun daneben stand, als sich der Mann mit dem Turban hereindrängte, um, eigentlich ohne Grund, eher zwangshaft, in den Spiegel zu blicken. Es war also ein Teil der Topographie und Gegenstände und vor allem mein Vorhaben vor und nach dem Szenenwechsel, den ich nicht bemerkt hatte, identisch. Dass der Traum, den ich aufschreiben wollte, eigentlich die Situation war, in der ich immer noch war, habe ich aber auch nicht bemerkt. (774 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2770 (1993-08-14 - Zürich)Ein Institutsfest. Es waren viele Studenten da. Alle waren sehr vergnügt und sprachen munter miteinander. Dann brachte mir jemand von meinen Leuten ein Schriftstück, um es mir zu zeigen. Es war wohl in einer Zwischenprüfung oder ähnlichen Situation entstanden. Der Verfasser hatte etwas zu Sätzen oder Thesen schreiben müssen, die von mir stammten. Er hatte das im Stil wie in einer etwas verreisssenden Rezension getan, in einem sehr hochtrabenden Stil mit Sätzen wie zum Beispiel: "Der Autor hat sich wirklich nicht mit Ruhm bekleckert" oder" Er schreibt von Göttern, aber er belegt es garnicht und beweist es garnicht". Nachdem ich das gelesen hatte, sagte ich zu meinen Mitarbeitern: "Aber das ist wirklich nicht adäqaut", wobei ich meinte und dachte, dass man sich darüber nicht aufregen dürfe, weil es wirklich an der Sache vorbei geschrieben war. Es zeigte sich auch, dass der Schreibende wohl nie in einer Vorlesung von mir gewesen war, sonst hätte er die Thesen als meine erkennen müssen und hätte sie in einer Prüfung wohl nicht einfach nur verrissen. Man hatte das Gefühl, dass er nur zeigen wollte, wie kritisch er war, und sich dabei eines hochmütigen Wissenschaftsstils bedient hatte, den er wohl irgendwo gelernt hatte. Ich fand gerade, dass wir darüber schnell zur Tagesordnung übergehen und weiter vergnügt sein sollten, als jemand kam und sagte: "Es muss etwas passiert sein. Alle waren so vergnügt und jetzt wirken alle verstimmt und reden mit ernster Mine miteinander." Uns war sofort klar, dass das Schriftstück die Runde gemacht hatte und nun als peinlich empfunden wurde. Ich überlegte, ob man etwas unternehmen sollte, zum Beispiel hingehen und ganz offen darüber reden und sagen, dass das doch ganz harmlos sei und nur ein kleiner Ausrutscher, weil der Verfasser eben versucht hätte, im Stil einer etwas hochtrabenden Rezension zu schreiben. Dann fand ich aber auch wieder, dass er eine solche Rettung eigentlich nicht verdient habe, weil das Schriftstück wirklich enorm hochnäsig und dumm war., und dass es vielleicht doch richtiger war, nichts zu tun und zu warten, bis die Verstimmung vorüber war, zumal es mich als Pensionierten ja auch nicht mehr anging. Bei diesen Überlegungen, ob ich etwas tun solle oder nicht, und wie es weitergehen würde, wachte ich auf. (367 words)

Teilweise musste ich auch selbst den Vortrag halten. Es war auf dem Lande in einem Schloss- oder Landhaus-artigen Gebäude, wo Leute zu einem Treffen oder Kurs versammelt waren. Zuletzt machte Weizsäcker alle Gedanken des Vortrags an einem Gemälde deutlich, das er beschrieb und erklärte, und das auf der Wand des Eingangshofes des Gebäudes war, in dem wir uns befanden. Es war nur noch in Spuren erhalten, wie ein Relief, das man in bestimmten Blickwinkeln nur, wenn das Licht entsprechend darauf fiel, noch erkennen konnte. Am Schluss ging er an die Stelle, wo ich war, weil man es von da am besten sehen konnte. Er legte sich dorthin. Auch ich lag da am Boden und rückte etwas zur Seite, damit er Platz hatte. Ich rückte dabei auch etwas weiter weg, als unbedingt nötig, damit er grosszügig dort Platz hatte. Er wurde mit einer Art Bettdecke zugedeckt, damit er sich nicht erkältete, denn er war schon sehr alt. Der Vortrag endete einfach in der stillen Betrachtung des Bildes, zu der er uns anhalten wollte. Teilweise war es hier auch, als ob es Gadamer sei. (204 words)

Ihnen fielen literarische Zitate zu den Sachen ein. Ich putzte indessen die Gegenstände. Zuletzt hatte ich eine alte Bürste in der Hand, von der Huber sagte, es sei eine "Kohlwandbürste", offenbar ein bäuerlicher Gegenstand. Und er meinte: "Wenn Sie die gut halten, können Sie sie noch zwei Stunden brauchen", wobei wohl an eine reine Gebrauchszeit von zwei Stunden gedacht war, also als wenn ich zwei Stunden lang damit unaufhörlich bürsten würde. Die Borsten der Bürste waren aus einer Art Rotkohlblättern, zwischen denen sich allerlei Fremdkörper gefangen hatten, die ich entfernte. Einige wirkten selber wie Blätter einer anderen Pflanze und mir war die Sache unheimlich, weil ich nicht wusste, ob ich hier etwas entfernt hatte, was vielleicht sogar zu der Bürste gehörte, und weil das ganze Gebilde irgendwie unheimlich war. Ich erwachte beunruhigt und mit dem Gefühl, einen Fehler gemacht zu haben. Dabei erfuhr ich vorher noch, dass jemand bereit sei, für die offenbar sehr seltene Bürste einen hohen Preis, sogar Tausende oder zweitausend, zu zahlen. Max Wehrli brachte vorher auch griechische Zitate, wobei das Wort chilioi in der Bedeutung von Tausend vorkam. Andere griechische Worte, die er ganz selbstverständlich sagte, verstand ich nicht und beendete darum dies Gespräch, das wie am Telephon war und so, als ob es mit seinem Bruder, dem Gräzisten Fritz Wehrli, geführt sei.

Jetzt aber war es in den Schnee geraten, reagierte nicht mehr auf meinen Zuruf, sondern wühlte sich durch den für es sehr hohen Schnee, in den es immer tiefer hineingeriet, sodass man nur noch unentwirrbar seine Glieder sich bewegen sah. Ich wagte nicht, es anzufassen, weil ich fürchtete, dass es mich jetzt doch mit seinen gefährlichen Zähnen beissen würde. Ich überlegte, was ich tun sollte, weil ich fürchtete, es könne erfrieren. Ich überlegte, ob es irgend eine Stelle oder Institution gäbe, die ich um Rat fragen, oder die helfen könne. Da kam Alli herein, sah die Situation, rief "O Du lieber Himmel", rief das Tier mit Namen an und packte es irgendwo und zog es aus dem Schnee hoch. Das Tier sprang nun vergnügt auf, war noch grösser als früher, aber wieder munter und ungefährlich trotz seiner Krokodilszähne. Ich genierte mich und erwachte ziemlich beunruhigt und mit Kopfweh und wollte zunächst den Traum nicht aufschreiben. (177 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2781 (1993-08-20 - Zürich)Ich war in einem Lager oder bei einem Ausflug, wo man im Freien kampierte. Dort konnte man Kurse belegen, unter anderem auch in Hebräisch und auch Kurse wohl kulturgeschichtlicher Art, die Hebräisch irgendwie einbezogen. Auf dem Lagerplatz lagen wir nebeneinander und breiteten unsere Sachen für das Kampieren aus. Die Leute neben mir breiteten ein Stück aus Stoff aus, von dem ich annahm, dass es meines sei, dann es hatte ein Design und Zeichen, ich glaube die Buchstaben OK, oder ähnlich, wie ich es bei mir hatte. Wie sich dann zeigte, war es aber nur ein ganz ähnliches Stück, denn als wir beide verglichen, sahen wir, dass das meine in Einzelheiten etwas anders gestaltet war. Die Nachbarn fanden diesen Vergleich sehr interessant. Es war eine freundliche Lageratmosphäre.- Vorher noch andere Traumszene: Ich war in einer Stadt, wo ich wohl früher einmal gewohnt hatte und sah die Mansarden, in denen ich gewohnt hatte, von unten von der Strasse. Auch Peter hatte dort einmal gewohnt und hatte sie gezeichnet. Ich war mir Emme und einem älteren Herren dort, der charmant wirkte, aber nicht recht zuhörte, worüber ich mich etwas ärgerte, vor allem, weil Emme so auf ihn einging, dass ich das, was ich in Bezug auf die Mansarden sagen wollte, nicht recht zu Ende sagen konnte, weil sie es als unwichtig abtaten. Der Mann sah aus wie der Schauspieler Johannes Heesters. (228 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2782 (1993-08-21 - Zürich)Ich musste einen Vortrag halten. Es war eine etwas unübersichtliche Kongresssituation. Das Katheder stand übereck in dem Saal, sodass man eigentlich diagonal zu den Leuten reden musste. Ich konnte zwar fliessend reden, obwohl ich etwas Schwierigkeiten hatte, mich in meinen Stichworten zurecht zu finden, die Leute hörten auch gut zu, aber ich hatte das Gefühl, dass der Kontakt zu oberflächlich war, was an der Art der Kongressatmosphäre lag. - Dann andere Szene, Ich ordnete alte Papiere und Zeitungsausschnitte. Es war ein ziemliches Durcheinander von Sachen. Darunter auch Hinweise auf Reiseziele einer Gegend, wie etwa Irrland. Einen Artikel hatte ich in viele kleine Einzelstücke auseinandergeschnitten, nach den Orten, die dort dargestellt waren. Ich wollte ihn eigentlich wegschmeissen, merkte aber nun, dass er gerade die Gegend betraf, in der wir reisten, und steckte darum all die kleinen Papierstücke in einen Umschlag. - Ander Szene. In einem Raum, wo viele Leute beieinander sassen, darunter eine junge Frau oder Mädchen, die mir gefiel, die aber etwas launisch wirkte. Zu meinem Erstaunen, begann sie, ihren linken Busen zu enthüllen. Dann merkte ich, dass sie ein Baby hatte, das sie stillen wollte. Sie wollte es an die Brust zum Stillen anlegen, hatte aber verschiedene andere Gegenstände in der Hand, die sie gleichzeitig irgendwie halten musste, was schwierig war. Ich hatte ihr helfen wollen, sie war aber abweisend und irritiert. Ich sagte zu jemand neben mir: "Ich hätte ihr helfen können. Ich hatte ihr doch dafür grünes Licht gegeben. Aber sie wollte nicht." Sie sagte nun: "Es war nur äusserlich grün, aber innerlich nicht" Ich fand, dass das nicht stimmte und schaute ihr über die Distanz unserer getrennten Sitzplätze hinweg in die Augen. Die Augen waren aber unruhig und wie die eines Kindes. Sie waren mir sympathisch, aber wie antwortlos. (293 words)

Sie packt meinen Kopf und küsst mich leidenschaftlich, während man schon Emme in Begleitung von irgendjemand herankommen hört. Ich sage zu ihr: "Mensch, hör uff, meine Frau wird eifersüchtig". Sie lässt meinen Kopf los und springt mit spizbübischem Lächeln zur Seite, wobei ich ihr Gesicht mit den betonten Backenknochen und die etwas schalkhaften Augen sehe. (61 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2784 (1993-08-22 - Zürich)Ich hatte eine Gesichtsoperation. Kleine Stücke der Haut, die irgendetwas hatten, wurden entfernt. Der Arzt in der Klinik, er war ein guter Bekannter und ähnlich wie Dr. Mäder, tat zuerst eine Flüssigkeit auf das Gesicht, von der ich erst später merkte, dass sie die Haut betäubte. Dann beschäftigte er sich mit der Gegend unter der Nase und stellte fest, dass dort viele Bartstoppeln waren, obwohl ich mich am Morgen rasiert hatte. So konnte er dort nichts machen. Ich sagte, ich könne es abrasieren, wenn er einen Apparat hätte. Aber das schien ihm nicht richtig, vielleicht wegen der Ansteckungsgefahr, und er sagte, dass wir diesen Teil eben später behandeln würden. Dann beschäftigte er sich mit der Haut auf den Backen und ich merkte, dass er hier nach und nach Stücke wegzog, wobei er sehr vorsichtig vorging und immer wieder eine Pause machte und nachdachte. Es tat nicht weh und seine Bewegungen und sein Vorgehen hatten etwas sehr Beruhigendes und Entspannendes. Ich überlegte aber, ob und wie es wohl weh tun würde, wenn die Betäubung vorüber wäre. Ich sah eine Art Verbandspäckchen dort liegen, aus dem er Dinge herausnahm, mit denen er agierte. Das Päckchen hatte verschiedene Sektionen, auf denen ihr Zweck auf englisch angeschrieben war. So stand auf einer, dass sie für den gesunden Bereich sei. Aus dieser nahm er die Sachen zur Behandlung der Oberlippe, wo die Bartstoppeln waren. Die ganze Atmosphäre des Klinikraums und seine Bewegungen und sein Verhalten hatten etwas ausgesprochen Beruhigendes. (244 words)

Ich muss darum mehrere Reissverschlüsse öffnen, weil er in einer Tasche ist, die selber in einer Tasche verwahrt ist. Ich bin dabei nackt, wie beim Umziehen im Schwimmbad.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2786 (1993-08-25 - Zürich)Eine Studentin aus Deutschland ruft mich an und will unbedingt eine Lizentiatsarbeit von mir betreut haben. Ich brauche einige Zeit, um ihr klar zu machen, dass ich keine Arbeiten mehr betreue. Dann fängt sie aber an, das Gespräch so zu wenden, dass sie fragt, wie es wäre, wenn jemand anders die Arbeit betreut. Ich mache ihr nun klar, dass sie ja jemand anders finden und dann aber mit diesem darüber sprechen muss. Nun beginnt sie, über eine Arbeit über das Thema Märchen zu sprechen und will mich in eine genaue Besprechung dieser überhaupt möglichen Arbeit ganz allgemein verwickeln. Irgendwie muss ich das Gespräch gewaltsam beenden, weil sie unerbittlich nicht damit aufhört und es mir nicht recht gelingt, ihr klar zu machen, dass ich nicht der richtige Gesprächspartner bin. Dann muss ich ganz schnell in ein Zimmer laufen, wohin der Weg über ein Stück Strasse führt, in dem ich meine goldene Uhr zurückgelassen habe. Mir wird klar, dass Bille, die vorhin in dem Zimmer war, herausgegangen ist und die Uhr so unbewacht ist und die Tür offen steht. Es gelingt mir, die Uhr zu holen und an mich zu nehmen. Bille sehe ich durch das Fenster des Zimmers draussen etwas erledigen, wie wenn sie eine Party vorbereitet. In einer anderen Szene des Traums, die vielleicht auch vorher war, geht es um einen Glaskasten, in dem verschiedene Dinge hübsch ausgestellt sind. Ein schwarzer runder Magnet ist aussen an dem Glas angeklippt und stört den Durchblick. Ich nehme diesen ab aus aesthetischen Gründen, obwohl ich nicht dafür zuständig bin, und verstecke ihn an der Rückwand eines Schranks oder Kastens daneben, sodass er noch da aber nicht leicht zu finden ist, damit ihn nicht wieder jemand störend an die Glaswand des anderen Kastens macht. Ich erwache schliesslich mit einem Seufzer aus diesen Träumen. Emme im Bett neben mir fragt: "Was ist?". Ich sage: "Träume, aber weiss nicht mehr", weil ich die Träume vergessen habe, nur noch eine dumpfe Ahnung von dem Telephongespräch. Emme sagt beunruhigend. "Dann schlaf weiter". Allmählich fallen mir die Träume wieder ein. (341 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2787 (1993-08-26 - Zürich)Um aus dem Haus herauszukommen, musste ich nackt aussen an dem eisernen Geländer einer steinernen Freitreppe in grosser Höhe entlangklettern. Ich hatte wohl einen Bademantel, den ich anziehen wollte. Aber das konnte ich nicht, solange ich keine Hand frei hatte. Ich konnte mich nur mit grosser Mühe an den senkrechten Stangen des eisernen Geländers halten, von einer Stange zur andern langend, wobei ich mit grosser Konzentration die Hände und Arme gleichsam zentimeterweise weiterbewegen musste, weil ich mit meinem ganzen Gewicht an den Stäben hing. Ich wusste aber, dass ich es schaffen würde. Aus einem schräg gegenüberliegenden Haus hörte ich einem Mann in der Höhe mir gegenüber zu einem anderen, wohl seinem Sohn, sagen: "So wie der Uslar musst Du es machen. Dann kommst Du heraus" Offenbar hatte auch er nur die Möglichkeit, auf diesem Kletterwege aus dem Haus heraus zu kommen. Ich hörte ihn antworten, dass ihm das aber zu gefährlich sei. Vorher andere Szene, die von der Wohnung in einem steinernen Haus mit sehr elementaren alten Mauern handelte, die sehr schön waren. Diesmal lag die Wohnung aber im Parterre. Sie hatte schöne Raumverhältnisse, die ich von aussen der Gestaltung der Mauer entnehmen konnte. (194 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2788 (1993-08-27 - Zürich)Ich ging nachts durch eine städtische Flusslandschaft wie an der Dreisam in Freiburg. Es war sehr dunkel aber schön. Ein Mann begegnete mir und fragte nach dem Weg zu einer Strasse, die ich nicht kannte, ich glaube, sie hiess Gundolfstrasse oder ähnlich. Ich wusste nur, dass sie im Norden lag. Er suchte dort etwas, ich glaube es war die Gewerbeschule oder etwas ähnliches. Er schien aber Zeit zu haben und schlendernd in der Dunkelheit spazieren zu gehen. Ich sagte, er müsse rechts abbiegen, und bemerkte, dass direkt vor uns eine Einmündung war. Ich sagte, er könne dort gehen, es sei wohl der Luisensteg, und dann weiter fragen. Ob es da irgendwo einen Stadtplan zu kaufen gäbe, wisse ich nicht, angeschlagen sei wohl keiner. Er würde wohl einen brauchen, um die Strasse zu finden. Wir gingen einige Schritte in die Richtung auf diese Einmündung, und ich merkte nun, dass es schon die Günterstalstrasse war, in die ich auch einbiegen wollte. Als ich das tat, merkte ich aber, dass diese Einmündung viel weiter ausserhalb der Stadt lag. Die Landschaft war hier anders, als sie es in Wirklichkeit in Freiburg ist, und die Entfernung so gross, dass man nicht zu Fuss in die Stadt gelangen konnte. Es standen viele Leute herum, wohl auf einen Autobus wartend, zu denen er sich gesellte. Ich hatte nun ein Fahrrad. Es war Emmes altes Fahrrad, das aus der Reparatur zurückgekommen war. Ich begann zu fahren, merkte aber,dass ich die Füsse nur so auf die Pedale bekam, dass ich sie nicht richtig treten konnte, weil ich sie nur mit den Absätzen berührte. Es war aber sehr schwer, die Füsse in die richtige Position zu bringen. Ich stieg ab und merkte nun, dass der Sattel viel zu niedrig war. Die Schraube, um die Stange zu lösen, war nicht mehr an der selben Stelle. Ich fand sie aber schliesslich. Sie war klein und zierlich, und als ich sie gelöst hatte, merkte ich, dass die Stange, die ich herauszog, viel zu kurz war, sodass man den Sattel nur begrenzt höher stellen konnte. Das Rad war schon alt und brüchig gewesen und sie hatten darum einfach Teile gegen solche von anderen alten Rädern ausgetauscht. Ich erwachte nun mit starken Kopfschmerzen. (368 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2789 (1993-08-28 - Zürich)Ich hatte eine Vorlesung über Musik im Rahmen der Vorlesung über Psychologie der Kunst. Heute - das heisst im geträumten Heute - wäre dabei eine Aufführung dran gewesen, in der die Studenten selber mitwirkten, weil viele von ihnen Instrumente hatten. Ich hatte das früher schon gemacht und es stand im Manuskript. Ich überlegte gerade, ob man das nicht weglassen sollte, weil es ziemlich aufwendig war und ich viele andere Dinge zur Verfügung hatte auf Tonband, die diese Zeit überbrücken würden, als Franz (Franz Zobler) herbeikam und fragte: "Wann kommt eigentlich die Aufführung dran? Urs Reichlin fragt schon danach, denn es ist ihm wichtig." Urs Reichlin hatte nämlich eine entscheidende Rolle bei dieser Aufführung. Es war, als ob Franz meine Gedanken telepathisch erraten hätte. Ich sagte mir also, dass man das nicht überspringen könne, und es kam die Rede darauf, ob wir es gleich heute machen. Ich meinte, es koste doch Vorbereitung,.Franz meinte, das könne man improvisieren. In einer Kiste waren Kostüme, die die Studenten dabei tragen sollten, schlafanzugähnliche Gewänder. Ich öffnete diese und besprach mit Franz, dass er für ihren Transport sorgen musste. Ich musste mich nun mit meinem Manuskript beschäftigen, weil ich mich an die Einzelheiten nicht mehr erinnerte, und Franz musste mit Urs Reichlin reden und losgehen, um ihn aufzusuchen. Emme, die aus dem Fenster guckte, sah, dass Franz in einen Raum auf der anderen Seite des Platzes ging, in dem sich Studenten des Instituts für Angewandte Psychologie trafen. Ich wachte dann langsam auf. Vorher waren noch andere Traumszenen gewesen, die ich vergessen habe. (256 words)

Ich dachte, sie würde nun sagen, dass ich auch mitreisen würde. Sie sagte aber: "Mein Mann kommt auch mit und bleibt bis zum neunzehnten neunten". Ich hatte gedacht, Martin könne nicht mitkommen und ich solle sie stattdessen begleiten. Nun schien es mir aber nicht sinnvoll, dass ich auch mitfahren würde, wenn Martin doch Zeit hatte. Dann erwachte ich. (103 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2792 (1993-08-30 - Zürich)Ich musste eine verkehrspsychologische Untersuchung machen. Es war deshalb schwierig, weil alles dort nicht ganz in Ordnung war. Es waren nicht genügend Stühle da, auf denen ich die Leute sitzen lassen konnte und ähnliches. Ich liess dann den Beisitzer, einen solchen gab es auch, auf einem Hocker sitzen. Zuerst schien mir die Frau, die ich untersuchen sollte, etwas schwierig und umständlich. Ich merkte dann aber, dass das nur situationsbedingt war und sie ganz in Ordnung war. Ihr Ehemann war auch dabei und ich liess ihn daneben sitzen. Schliesslich ging ich mit dem Kollegen, mit dem zusammen ich untersuchte, er war wie eine Art Praktikant oder Helfer dabei, hinaus und sagte ihm, dass ich die Frau positiv begutachten wolle und man sie fahren lasen könne. Dann später andere Traumszene: Jetzt musste ich salbst zu einer verkehrspsychologischen Untersuchung gehen als Untersuchter. Es war eine beschwerliche Reise dorthin, und als ich schliesslich in dem Institut an der Theke stand, wo man sich anmelden musste, sagte der Mann, ein Psychologe, der meinen Namen mehrmals nicht verstanden hatte, als er ihn schliesslich verstand, die Akte sei nicht da. Ich hatte vor kurzem noch mit jemand dort telephoniert, der die Akte vor sich gehabt hatte, und war entschlossen, mich nicht einfach abweisen zu lassen, weil das ja bedeutet hätte, dass ich die langwierige Reise später noch ein zweites mal machen müsste. Ich wollte ihm das sagen und erwachte etwas verärgert. Bei der Anmeldung hatten viele Jugendliche oder Kinder auch an der Theke gewartet. Ein Mann, der mich kannte, hatte gesagt, ich solle mich gleich melden. Ich wollte mich aber nicht vordrängen, wurde aber gleich angesprochen und sagte meinen Namen, den er ja, wie schon gesagt, nicht verstand. (281 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2795 (1993-09-01 - Zürich)Ich übte mit Tina zusammen den Umgang mit kleinen Babys und wollte ihr zeigen, wie man Babies übergibt. Ich stand am Fenster und sagte: "Ich würde Dir also das Baby durchs Fenster übergeben, denn Babies werden ja durchs Fenster übergeben". Als ich das sagte, merkte ich schon, dass sie es wörtlich nehmen und versuchen könne, zu diesem Zweck zum Fenster rauszuklettern. Vor dem Fenster war nämlich ein kleines schräges Vordach. Kaum hatte ich den Satz gesagt, als Tina sich auch schon anschickte aus der Tür zu gehen, um im Nebenzimmer aus dem Fenster zu klettern. Ich schrie: "Nein Tina, nein!" Aber sie ging unerbittlich los ins Nebenzimmer. Dabei legte sie einen Art Feuerschutz an für eine Feuerwehrübung, denn solche Übungen hatte sie auch gemacht, offenbar zusammen mit der Bewohnerin des Nebenzimmers. Sie war nun schon dort am Fenster zu hören, offenbar im Begriff, herauszuklettern. Das schien mir viel zu gefährlich, denn ich hatte Angst, sie könne abstürzen und schrie noch mehr: "Nein Tina nein!" und erwachte mit einem Seufzer, den ich wirklich machte und im Erwachen noch hörte, und mit Herzklopfen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2796 (1993-09-02 - Zürich)Ich ging zu einer Chor- und Orchesterprobe. Es war in einer Kirche. Ich ging viele Stufen hoch und kam an einzelnen Kindern vorbei, die im Chor mitsangen. Einzelne kannte ich schon von früheren Proben anderer Konzerte, so einen schwarzen Jungen, der mir mit seinem Temperament gefallen hatte. Er erkannte mich aber nicht wieder. Dann ging ich durch eine Tür wie auf einer Orgelempore, dann durch einen langen leicht gewundenen Gang, und kam schliesslich auf eine Empore, auf der einige Leute sassen und von der man in das Kirchenschiff herabsah, das von Stühlen leer geräumt war. Einige Leute lagen auf dem Parkettfussboden, wie zu einer Opernaufführung arrangiert. Jemand, vielleicht der Dirigent, redete mit einem anderen. Ich hatte noch ein paar Töne gehört. Es wurde Händel gespielt. Ein Mann kam von hinten auf der Empore hervor, stellte sich neben, mich legte mir den Arm auf den Rücken - ich war gerade herabblickend vorgebeugt - und sagte in gebrochenem Deutsch: "Diese Saal ist nicht fur Handel. Es steht zu viel Ballast herum. Und die Schule ist - faul". Er musste hier irgend eine Funktion haben. Vielleicht war er auch Dirigent. Er hielt mich wohl für jemand, der dazu gehört. Ich verstand aus seiner Rede, dass er sich für die Händelaufführung einen freieren Raum vorstellte, wo nicht Chorgestühl und ähnliches am Rande herumstand. Mit "Die Schule ist - faul" wollte er wohl halb im Scherz sagen, dass die Chormitglieder nicht fleissig genug seien, oder nicht genügend mitgingen, oder etwas ähnliches. Ich überlegte, ob und wie ich antworten solle, was etwas schwierig war, da ich doch gerade erst hereingekommen war. (265 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2797 (1993-09-03 - Zürich)Traum von einem Mann, der sich selbst schädigte, indem er immer wieder versuchte, aus dem Fenster zu springen, sich Brandwunden zuzufügen, sich selbst Spritzen zu geben, die er für Therapie hielt, die aber gefährlich waren. Manches konnte man verhindern, manches nicht. So fügte er sich zuletzt Brandwunden im Gesicht zu. Ich wusste nicht, was man dagegen tun konnte. Er versuchte es auch, an anderen zu tun, was man immer gerade noch verhindern konnte. Auch hier hielt er es für eine Therapie und wollte ihnen eigentlich helfen. Sehr beunruhigtes Erwachen, dann begann ich ganz schnell den Traum zu vergessen, er kam aber wieder in die Erinnerung zurück. (106 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2798 (1993-09-04 - Zürich)Ich wollte zu einem Konzert. Es sollte um fünf Uhr in Oerlikon stattfinden. Also fuhr ich mit der Strassenbahn durch die nächtliche Stadt. Als ich an der Haltestelle Felsenrainstrasse vorbeigekommen war, wo ich immer zu Kalan, dem Photographen, aussteigen muss, kam ich in eine Gegend, durch die ich noch nie gefahren war. Der Konzertsaal lag irgendwo am Rande der Stadt. Ich fragte an der Endhaltestelle den Strassenbahnfahrer, ob er wisse, wo es sei. Er ging mit mir in eine Art Endhaltestellenhäuschen, um es nachzusehen. Dort lagen allerlei Programme, wohl damit der Mann, der sonst da an einem Schalter sitzt, den Leuten Auskunft geben kann. Aber jetzt in der Nacht war niemand da. Er fand auch keinen Hinweis auf mein Konzert. Ich bekam plötzlich Zweifel, ob es überhaupt um fünf Uhr morgens und nicht etwa nachmittags sein würde, ging aber schliesslich einfach los, um das Konzert- und Theatergebäude zu suchen. Es war auch noch viel Zeit zu überbrücken und es war fröstelig und kalt in der dunklen Nacht. Schliesslich aber fand ich das Gebäude. Drinnen standen schon Leute in einem Art Vorraum. Ein Mann begrüsste mich erfreut und sagte: Es ist wider ein anderer Eingang. Ich erinnerte mich jetzt, dass ich den Mann schon mal hier vor einer Orchesterprobe von De Stoutz getroffen hatte und man damals nicht durch den normalen Eingang hereinkam, sondern einen anderen Eingang suchen musste. So folgte ich ihm durch einen foyer-artigen Gang. Ich hatte über einem schwarzen Anzug meinen Bademantel an. Ich hörte jemand sagen: "Da geht jemand im Bademantel zum Konzert". Also zog ich den Bademantel aus und überlegte nun, wie ich ihn so falten könnte, dass er nicht auffiele. Dann war ich schliesslich in einem hohen Rang des theaterartigen Gebäudes und erlebte die Aufführung. Es war wie eine Oper oder ein Musical, eigentlich beides zugleich. Zwei riesige Pferde kamen vor, ein Rotes und ein Weisses, die sich gewaltig aufbäumten und dabei von der Bühne vorkommend oder emporwachsend den ganzen Raum ausfüllten. Es war sehr eindrucksvoll. Ich sass allein im Hintergrund des Ranges und überlegte, dass ich mich umziehen müsse, wusste aber nicht recht, wie ich das unauffällig bewältigen könne. Es war zwar dunkel, aber man würde mich doch dabei sehen können. Ich fand es wichtig, dass mich vor allem der Dirigent dabei nicht sehen würde. Er kuckte zwar nach vorne zum Orchester, konnte sich aber umdrehen. So war ich gerade in der Unterwäsche und versuchte in die neu anzuziehenden Oberkleider hereinzukommen. Schliesslich hatte ich das aber anscheinend doch geschafft und die Aufführung des Theaterstücks endete. Ich wusste nun, dass es ein Traum war und ich das als Traum aufschreiben musste. Dafür musste ich aber wieder den langen Weg durch die Stadt zurücklegen, um zu meinem Computer zu kommen, und durfte dabei den Traum nicht vergessen, vor allem nicht die beiden gewaltigen Pferde, das rote und das weisse Pferd. Also lief ich ganz schnell an allen Leuten vorbei die vielen Treppen herunter, die von dem hochgelegenen Rang des Theaters herabführten. Dabei erwachte ich. (498 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2799 (1993-09-05 - Zürich)Ich war in einer Werkstatt, wo ich eine Arbeit verrichten sollte, vor allem an zwei bestimmten Geräten. Der Meister war da, der es mir schon etwas gezeigt hatte, und ein Mann war gekommen, der eine Art kontrollierende Funktion hatte, wohl vom Staat. Der Meister hatte mir meine Tätigkeit schon etwas erklärt. Der andere Mann hatte aber eigentlich nicht mich, sondern wohl den Betrieb zu kontrollieren. Ich musste also eine Arbeit, die ich eigentlich noch garnicht richtig gelernt hatte, vorführen, und für den Meister hing viel davon ab. Ich gab mir also Mühe. Die Geräte hatten eine Art Bahnen, in die in einem grossen rechteckigen Rahmen Stofffäden gespannt waren. Da musste man bei dem einen Gerät mit den Beinen, bei dem anderen mit den Armen irgendwelche Hebel bewegen. Nun musste der Meister dem Mann auch irgendwie erklären, wie teuer die Produkte werden würden, und ich musste dafür den Arbeitsaufwand und die nötige Arbeitsintensität schätzen. Die Beiden hoben vor allem auf die geforderte Beinleistung ab, mir aber wurde klar, dass die erforderliche Hauptleistung eigentlich eine solche der Konzentration bei der Beobachtung der Fäden war. Das ganze war wie eine Arbeit an Webstühlen, es waren aber Geräte mit einer irgendwie anderen Funktion. Während wir noch so redeten, fiel eine grosse Lampe, die aus einem kissenartig aussehenden geschlossenen weissen Schirm und der Zuleitungsschnur bestand, mit Knall und Kurzschluss von der Decke. Die Befestigung hatte sich gelöst. Es war ein Nagel, der noch an dem Schirm hing, und den man wohl wieder einschlagen konnte. Ich wollte den Stecker aus der Steckdose ziehen, bekam aber einen elektrischen Schlag, als ich an einem Plastik-gebilde, einer durchsichtigen Hülle, zog, die wohl noch vom Verkauf her an dem Stecker hing. Ich nahm also zur Isolierung zwei Tempotücher, die ich in der Tasche hatte, und mit denen ich den Stecker anfasste und rauszog. So ging es. Ich erklärte, was ich tat und wie man am besten mit der Situation umgehen konnte. Dabei wurde mir klar, dass auch das wieder für den Meister wichtig war, diesmal, weil es dem Kontrolleur gegenüber ja eine sozusagen unbeabsichtigte und improvisierte praktische Arbeitsprobe darstellte. Bei der Überlegung, dass ich jetzt eine Leiter holen müsste, erwachte ich, als ich gerade gesagt hatte, dass ich glaube, dass die Lampe noch funktioniere und es nicht einen erneuten Kurzschluss geben werde, wenn man sie wieder richtig aufhänge.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2800 (1993-09-06 - Zürich)Traum um eine Kindergabel. Mit ihr sollte eigentlich Tobias etwas zu Essen kriegen oder ein anderes Enkelkind. Ich habe sie aber gleichzeitig Corinne geliehen, weil ich glaubte, es wären mehrere solche Gabeln da. Es ist nicht ganz klar, ob sie selber damit essen sollte, oder ob sie auch ein Kind hatte, das etwas damit bekommen sollte. Ich hatte die Gabel zu dem Essen gelegt, das wir ihr geschickt hatten, und sie wäre dann zusammen mit dem Teller wieder zurückgekommen. Nun suchte ich die nächste Gabel für Tobias und es waren auch noch zwei da, aber die eine hatte etwas dünne Zinken, die sich verbiegen konnten, die andere war wie ein Kamm ohne Biegung der Zinken geschnitten, sodass sie wohl stabil war, aber weniger bequem. Emme hatte sie früher mal für unsere Kinder selbst gemacht. Ich erwachte nun mit einem etwas schlechten Gewissen. (142 words)

Sie waren für ein Album bestimmt, dass er wohl zum Geburtstag bekommen sollte.Dann ging es um das Aufschreiben dieses Traums. Ich war erwacht, hatte nach der Uhr gesehen und gemerkt, dass es noch vor Mitternacht war, und war wieder eingeschlafen und träumte weiter. Der Computer spielte eine Rolle und die Tatsache, dass dieser automatisch das Datum schrieb. Der Traum sollte einerseits das Datum des Tages tragen, in der Nacht auf welchen der Traum geträumt war. Bei Träumen vor Mitternacht ist das aber dann eigentlich nicht das richtige Datum. In solchen Fällen kann man schreiben: Traum in der Nacht zum sonundsovielsten. Aber wenn der Computer das Datum automatisch schreibt, schreibt er natürlich das Datum vom Vortag, das dann ja noch das richtige Datum ist, an dem man schreibt. Mit diesem Problem wachte ich wieder auf. (148 words)

Ich war in einem kleinen Raum zu ebener Erde, in dem ich ihn empfangen wollte, und sah durch ein kleines schmales Fenster eine Hand, die ein Netz über ein gerade eingeparktes Auto warf, gleichsam um es zu versorgen. Ich dachte, es könne Kindler sein und kuckte ganz hinaus, indem ich mich aufrichtete, und sah Kindler neben seinem Auto stehen. Er erblickte mich und ich sagte: "Ich will mal sehen, ob ich das Fenster aufmachen kann." Es war aber sehr schwierig, die Hand zum Riegel des Fensters zu heben. Es war, als ob sie bleischwer war, und ich konnte sie nur gleichsam in ganz kleinen Schritten wie gegen Widerstände heben. Als ich den Riegel erreicht hatte und aufschieben wollte, erwachte ich. Kindler strömte in der ganzen Zeit in seiner freundlichen und fürsorglichen Art Ruhe und Zuversicht aus. (143 words)

Der eine trug eine Uniform, von der Polizei oder auch der Bahn oder einer anderen Berufsklasse, der ander eine zivile jüdische Kleidung. Sie kamen entweder aus Europa oder aus Israel und waren wohl gerade auf Reisen. Sie hatten das Fest schon eine Weile zusammen gefeiert und wollten die Feier jetzt zusammen mit mir fortsetzen, irgendwie glücklich, einen Menschen gefunden zu haben, mit dem zusammen sie es tun konnten. Sie waren irgendwie gerührt oder ergriffen von der Feststimmung und wollten mir das mitteilen. Es ging auch darum, wo wir jetzt hingingen und was wir weiter tun wollten. Sie legten mir den Arm auf die Schulter und waren in Feststimmung. Dann bin ich wohl langsam aufgewacht. (134 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2808 (1993-09-11 - Zürich)"Es kommt mir so vor, dass wir das alles haben (Wissen, statt klein heisst es klar). Jemand klopft mir auf die Schulter und sagt: Will es jetzt nicht in die Köste. Es bin ich. Köste scheint die Wanne zu sein - wohl wie Kiste". - So die direkte unmittelbare Notiz., bei der ich aber das Wort "klein" zu schreiben vergessen habe. Der Satz hiess:"Es kommt mir so vor, dass wir das alles klein haben" Ich wusste aber sofort, dass es "klar"statt "klein" heissen musste. Es war, als wenn ich wie noch müde, das richtige: "Es kommt mir so vor, dass wir das alles klar haben" noch nicht richtig formulieren konnte. Ich hörte den Satz wie von mir selbst gesprochen und zugleich wie von einer anderen Stimme gesprochen. Es war ein leise gesprochener Satz. Dann kam danach als nächstes, dass mir jemand auf die Schulter klopfte und den Satz sagte."Will es jetzt nicht in die Köste". Mit "Es" war ich gemeint, und ich hatte im Aufwachen das Gefühl, dass mit "Köste" Wanne gemeint war und dass es ein Wort ähnlich wie Kiste war. Auch hier war es offenbar so, dass die Wortfindung für die sprechende Stimme schwierig war. Der Traumtext lautet also im Zusammenhang: "Ich hörte einen Satz wie von mir selbst und zugleich wie von einer anderen Stimme gesprochen:"Es kommt mir so vor dass wir das alles klein haben". Ich wusste aber, dass es statt "klein" klar heissen musste. Es war, als wenn ich, noch müde, das Wort "klar" noch nicht richtig aussprechen oder finden konnte. Es war ein leise gesprochener Satz.- Dann klopfte mir jemand auf die Schulter und sagte: "Will es jetzt nicht in die Köste?" Mit Es war dabei ich gemeint, und ich hatte im Aufwachen das Gefühl, dass mit "Köste" Wanne gemeint war und dass es ein Wort ähnlich wie "Kiste"war. (305 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2809 (1993-09-12 - Zürich)In der Salzstrasse in Freiburg im Breisgau in der Nähe der beiden Palais. Es war etwas explodiert in der Gegend jenseits der Eisenbahn. Von da kam ein weisser Nebel, der die Leute bewusstlos zu Boden sinken liess. Radfahrer transportierten einen Brief, der an einen Arzt gerichtet war, der in der Wiehre, etwa in der Gegend der Brauerei Ganter wohnte. Ich sah, wie der Nebel auch in die Salzstrasse gelangte und ein Radfahrer, der diesen Brief transportierte und durch die am Boden liegende weisse Nebelwolke hindurchfuhr, langsam zu Boden sank. Ein anderer nahm den Brief auf und setzte die Fahrt mit seinem eigenen Fahrrad fort. Sonst war die Strasse menschenleer. Der Brief wanderte so von einem zum anderen, um sein Ziel, den Arzt zu erreichen, der offenbar zur Bekämpfung der Katastrophe wichtig war. Die betreffenden Radfahrer widmeten sich dieser Aufgabe sehr diszipliniert. (Bei der Niederschrift des Traums hatte ich zuerst versehentlich Feierling statt Ganter geschrieben) (154 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2810 (1993-09-12 - Zürich)Eine Stimme sagte: "Ein Herausziehen aus dem hypnagogen System". Dann sah ich ein grosses Gesicht über mir, das mich anblickte, etwa wie ein flacher direkt über mir schwebender Gesichtslampion, aber auch wie das Gesicht einer afrikanischen Plastik. Dann wachte ich sofort wieder auf und konnte noch feststellen, dass die Worte "Wie ein Herausziehen aus dem hypnagogen System" das Ende eines Satzes waren, den ich gerade gedacht hatte und der von den Badewannenträumen und ihrer Deutung handelte. Das Erklingen der Stimme geschah also mitten in diesem Gedanken, gleichsam als Umwandlung des sprachlichen Denkens in reales Hören. (95 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2811 (1993-09-13 - Zürich)Es war ein Tanzfest. Irgendetwas war in der Organisation ins Stocken geraten. Zwei Frauen spielten eine Rolle, die irgendeine Funktion hatten. Sie sollten auftreten, oder einen Auftritt in Gang bringen, waren aber nicht da, und ich hörte jemand sagen: Jetzt sollten die beiden eigentlich erscheinen. Dann fiel mir ein, dass ich auch irgend eine organisatorische Funktion hatte, die aber gar nicht klar definiert war. Es hatte geheissen, ich solle der Verbindungsmann zwischen den Beiden und den Anderen sein. Also machte ich mich auf den Weg, sie zu suchen. Das Gelände, auf dem das Fest stattfand, verlief sich hier in eine Strasse, auf der geschäftiges ausserfestliches Treiben herrschte wie auf einer belebten alltäglichen Strasse. Es hatte keinen Zweck, sie hier zu suchen und sich dabei vom Festgelände zu entfernen. Während ich noch darüber nachdachte kam eine Reihe von Leuten Walzer tanzend einen kleinen schmalen bergab von dem Gelände auf die Strasse herabführenden Weg herunter. Jeder tanzte allein in Walzerdrehungen den Weg hinunter. Es sah sehr elegant aus und ihre Röcke und Gewänder schwangen, die irgend wie eine Art Kostüm aus der Walzerzeit waren. Ich bekam Lust, mit zu tanzen, und dachte: Aha, jetzt ist das Fest also wieder richtig in Gang gekommen, merkte aber dann, dass es eine Art private Einzelgruppe inmitten der allgemeinen Festgesellschaft war, die das unternahm. Während ich noch darüber nachdachte, ob ich mich nicht dazwischen mischen und mit ihnen in Walzerschritten tanzen sollte, kam eine Frau, die mich um die Hüfte fasste und mit mir Walzer tanzte in wunderbar ausgewogenen und schwingenden Schritten. Sofort hob sich meine Stimmung und ich erwachte mit einem angenehmen Gefühl des Rhythmus und der Bewegung des Tanzes und mit der Walzermelodie im Ohr. Die Uhr schlug vier Uhr morgens. (287 words)

Es war eine Art Kongress oder Musikfest oder etwas Ähnliches. Ein Mädchen dort hob Sachen zum Essen für mich auf, die ich mir gekauft hatte, so ein Stück Schinken. Ich hatte schon gegessen, es war Mittags, und wollte nur noch einen Haps von dem Schinken hinterheressen. Sie fand aber, dass man den allein nicht essen könne, weil er dann nicht gut oder zu herb schmecken würde, und schlug mir allerlei Gerichte aus Sachen vor, die auch noch da waren und die sie wohl dazu gekauft hatte. Bei ihren Vorschlägen, die sehr fürsorglich waren, waren aber auch Kleidungsstücke, die sie an sich hielt, um sie mir vorzuführen. Ich war etwas verwundert, weil man die doch nicht essen konnte, und versuchte auch, ihr klar zu machen, dass ich eigentlich schon gegessen hatte. Der Raum in dem wir waren, war wie der Vorraum eines Kongresses oder der Empfangsraum in einem Hotel. Ich war offenbar auf Reisen. (169 words)

Es stehen auch noch zwei Teller mit Salat da, bei denen aber Gurke ist, die ich nicht vertrage, weswegen ich davon nicht essen kann. Die Kellnerin, die die Situation bemerkt hat, kommt herbei und sagt:"Da ist ja auch noch Blumenklkohl", und zeigt auf diesen, der auch noch für uns dasteht. Jetzt bemerkt auch Emme die Situation und gibt mir Essen und Blumenkohl auf den Teller, und ich beginne zu essen und erwache. (126 words)

Es war eine Tradition, die ich selbst ursprünglich angefangen hatte und die nun andere nach meinem Rücktritt weiter führten. Ich war stolz darauf. Alle diese Qualitäten und Wirkungen der Namen erinnere ich genau, aber ich kann mich an keinen einzelnen dieser Namen direkt erinnern. Es ist, als wenn das Sich-Enztziehen der Namen in der Traumerinnerung selbst zu ihrer Unheimlichkeit gehört. (84 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2815 (1993-09-16 - Zürich)Ich war in der Uni. Ein Konzert sollte aufgeführt werden. Es war eine improvisierte Aufführung eines Quartetts. Es waren nur wenige Zuhörer da, die Leute, die sowieso gerade dort waren. Man musste sich selber Stühle in den Raum holen. Ich tat das mehrfach. Immer setzte sich ein anderer drauf. Zuletzt waren nur noch sehr flache Stühle zu finden, die mir nicht bequem schienen. Dann fand aber noch jemand Klappstühle. Ich holte mir auch einen solchen und stellte ihn hinter einen Tisch. Um mich dann darauf zu setzen, musste ich über einen Strang Kabel steigen, den jemand dort ausgelegt hatte und der, glaube ich, zu einem Computer oder einem Tonaufnahmegerät führte. Als ich darüber gestiegen war und mich auf meinen Stuhl setzten wollte, sagte jemand: "Das ist mein Stuhl. Da soll ich drauf sitzen". Ich antwortete: "Ich habe schon fünf Stühle hereingetragen und immer hat sich jemand anders drauf gesetzt. Diesen muss ich nun selber nehmen. Das tut mir leid. Sie müssen sich draussen noch einen suchen." Ich setzte mich hin. Vor mir sass jemand auf dem Tisch, auf den er sich wohl nur gesetzt hatte, um darüber zu klettern und einen Platz zu finden. Er rutschte dabei langsam aus und glitt über den Tisch und einen davor liegenden Deckensatpel herab. Es sah sehr komisch aus. Dann andere Szene. Vor dem Haus. Emme war oben auf der Rampe vor unserer Haustür, ich darunter vor dem Kellereingang, wo ich etwas geholt hatte. Die Unterbewohner, Vater, Mutter, der kleine Sohn und die kleine Tochter, kamen vorbei. Sie waren mit dem Auto nach Hause gekommen und gingen nun gerade die Kellertreppe im Freien herunter, die auch zu ihrer Gartenwohnung führt. Ich hörte Emme mit ihnen reden und sagte auch etwas, damit sie nicht erschrecken sollten, wenn ich direkt vor ihnen am Fuss der Treppe auftauchen würde. Sie hörten es aber zuerst nicht, reagierten dann sehr freundlich, wie sie es immer tun. Es war mir wichtig, vor allem die beiden etwas ängstlichen Kinder nicht zu erschrecken. (331 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2816 (1993-09-17 - Zürich)Ich versuchte eine grosse sehr dicke Tür zu einem Keller mit einem Sicherheitsschlüssel zu öffnen. Der Schlüssel ging zwar mühelos rein, liess sich aber nicht umdrehen. Emme versuchte das selbe mit einem anderen Schlüssel von innen her. Es musste wohl noch einen anderen Eingang geben, durch den sie reingekommen war. Schliesslich gelang es uns beiden gleichzeitig. Die Schlüssel drehten sich und die Tür öffnete sich. Ich trat von aussen in den Keller ein, in dem Emme schon drin war. Er war gross und geräumig und ganz leer. Ich sagte im Scherz etwas, wie, dass der Durchbruch zwischen zwei Kontinenten geschafft sei, oder etwas ähnliches. Der Kellerraum war gross und urtümlich wie eine natürliche Höhle. Die Wärme strömte von aussen in den noch ganz kühlen Raum ein. Vorher andere Szenen, in denen ich mit einer Frau nackt in einem See oder im Meer badete. Ich legte meine Kleider in einen Hauseingang. Dann noch eine andere Szene, in der Emme ein weit ausgeschnittenes Kleid hatte, dessen Ausschnitt man auf oder zu klappen konnte. Wir fuhren in der Strassenbahn. (176 words)

Er hatte uns irgendwann kennen gelernt und wir unterhielten uns immer, wenn er da war. Wir gingen auch nicht in seine Konzerte. Es war eine freundliche Atmosphäre und erinnerte ihn wahrscheinlich an zu Hause. Auch andere Szenen in dem Traum, deren Einzelheiten ich vergessen habe, handelten von solchen freundlichen und entspannten Gesprächskontakten, und zwar mit einer Frau, die uns besuchte. Erwachen. (Während ich noch über den Traum nachdachte und ihn in Erinnerung rief, muss ich wieder eingeschlafen sein, denn ich wachte erneut auf, als Emme zu mir sagrte: "Du musst ja garnicht". Ich fragte: "Den Traum aufschreiben? Habe ich das gesagt?". Sie antwortete: "Ja. Du hast gesagt, Du willst den Traum nicht aufschreiben." Das war sehr beruhigend. Ich rief ihn mir aber dann doch wieder ins Gedächtnis und habe ihn nun doch aufgeschrieben.) (159 words)

Ich sagte: "Das ist jetzt nicht wichtig. Viel wichtiger ist die Frage, ob man es ausbeulen kann. " Das Tintenfass war breit und flach, in Jugendstilform und gehämmert. Der Angesprochene hob gerade an, sich zu rechtfertigen und zu sagen, dass auch so viel am Boden stünde. Es waren mehrere Leute in dem Raum, wohl wie auf Reisen, oder unterwegs.

Andere Szene: Ich treffe Bille, Tina und Belli auf einem belebten Platz. Ich schenke Belli ein Bild, auf dem man sie hinter der Gardine sieht. Belli selbst schenkt Bille oder Tina ein Bild, das sie von ihr gemacht hat, auf dem das Gesicht sehr zart aussieht, und Tina schenkt Belli eine Reihe von Bildern, die ziharmonikaartig gefaltet zusammenhängen und die sie von Belli gemacht hat.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2821 (1993-09-21 - Zürich)Aufführung eines Theaterstücks, in dem in kurzen präzisen Sätzen das Walten der Natur gepriesen wurde. "Der Stern der Vernunft ist nun erwacht" hiess es dann in einem Satz. Ich war entzückt von dem Stück und seiner Aufführung und sagte: "Das ist ja reine Aufklärung. Eine faszinierende Inszenierung", was der anwesende Regisseur gerne hörte. Das Stück spielte an drei oder vier Teichen, wobei sich die Handlung langsam und unmerklich in ihren Schwerpunkten von einem Teich zum anderen verschob. So hörte ich, wie hinter mir von Kinderstimmen der Satz ertönte: "Dieser Teich ist ja ganz ausgetrocknet. Hier kann ja kein Theater mehr stattfinden", oder ähnlich. Mir wurde jetzt bewusst, dass ich von dort schon länger keine Sätze mehrt gehört hatte, während es am Anfang ganz der Ort der Handlung war. Diese hatte sich nun ganz an den Teich verschoben, neben dem ich jetzt sass, und begann schon, zum nächsten Teich links neben mir überzugehen. Die klaren Sätze des Stückes, die kunstvoll gebaut waren, verstand man nur richtig, wenn man die Augen geöffnet hielt. Das fiel mir auf, als ich sie einmal zum Nachdenken geschlossen hatte,und es wurde mir gleichsam hintergründig klar, dass das Walten der Vernunft in der Natur und in der Wirklichkeit des Geschehens, das sich hier darstellte, nur mit offenen Augen richtig erfasst wird.

Ich hatte das Zitat von Emme gehabt und war im Begriff, zu sagen, dass ich meine Frau, von der ich es hätte, fragen wolle, als ich erwachte. Das Sprichwort war englisch und ich habe nur Bruchstücke davon behalten Es hiess: "The Hand in the Pocket and the (sowieso) in the Value." An das fehlende Wort kann ich mich nicht erinnern.

Es war ein zunächst klein wirkender Aufzugsraum, der sich aber seitlich in die Länge zog, sodass man sogar darin hätte liegen können. Ein andermal, als wir die Tür gerade wieder öffnen wollten, warf eine Frau ein paar Gegenstände durch den Spalt unter der Aufzugtür, der einige Zentimeter hoch war, hindurch, ehe sie hereinging. Ich sagte : "Hoffentlich geht die Tür auch auf, dass Sie zu Ihren Sachen kommen. Der Schlüssel klemmt nämlich oft". Die Tür ging aber auch da wieder auf.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2826 (1993-09-25 - Zürich)Ich hatte mich irgendwelchen Leuten angeschlossen, oder war zu ihnen geraten, die in Kellern wohnten und ein Landstreicherleben führten oder auch wie wandernde Handwerker. Zuletzt waren es zwei Männer, die älter und erfahrener waren als ich. Sie mussten irgendwo hin gehen, um etwas zu organisieren, und ich sollte mit, musste aber vorher noch irgendetwas machen und verlor auf dem Weg den Anschluss. Es ging durch eine Landschaft. Ich folgte dem Weg weiter und hatte das Gefühl, ungefähr zu wissen, wohin ich gehen musste. Dann aber wurde die Landschaft schneereich. Immer höhere Schneeberge säumten den Weg. Plötzlich endete der freigeschaufelte Pfad vor einem Bauernhaus. Ich ahnte die Richtung, in die ich weitergehen musste, und meinte, hinten eine Strasse zu entdecken. Ich musste durch den tiefen Schnee gehen und geriet in eine bergige Gegend mit steil abfallenden Hängen, die in Klüfte führten. Schliesslich konnte ich nur noch weiter, wenn ich über einen Schneehügel kletterte, neben dem es abgrundtief herabging. Der Bewegungsspielraum war so klein geworden, dass ich in Gefahr kam, abzustürzen. Es wurde mir klar, dass ich umkehren musste, den ganzen Weg zurückgehen und wieder in den Keller und dort warten, ob sie zurückkämen. Dabei wachte ich allmählich auf, überlegte noch wie es wäre, wenn ich jetzt die Nachricht bekäme, dass ich Geld geerbt hätte. Ob ich die Leute in das bürgerliche Leben mitnehmen könne und dass ich sie dann wohl mein ganzes Leben bei mir haben würde, sie aber andererseits das wohl garnicht wollen würden. Mit einem unangenehmen Gefühl über dieses Dilemma wurde ich allmählich so ganz wach, dass mir klar wurde, dass ja alles nur Traum war. (267 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2827 (1993-09-25 - Zürich)Ich sass mit jemand in der Wirtschaft. Die Kellnerin brachte etwas, was ich bestellt hatte und weil der Zugang zu meinem Platz für sie schwierig war, gab sie es dem Anderen mit der Bitte, es mir weiter zu reichen. Ich hatte schon fast vergessen, dass ich das bestellt hatte. Es hatte Reis und Würstchen gegeben. Der Reis schmeckte sehr gut, aber er lag auf einem Teller, dessen Oberfläche sehr rauh und wie granuliert war und deshalb unter der Gabel kreischte und es schwierig machte, den Reis mit der Gabel aufzunehmen. Ich hatte deshalb gesagt, als ich Reis nachbestellte, sie möge ihn auf die glatte Rückseite des Tellers legen. Das hatten sie nun gemacht und zwar auf einem ovalen Teller, den sie, weil ja seine Wölbung jetzt falsch herum war, wiederum auf einen zweiten ovalen Teller gestellt hatten. Ausserdem war in einem anderen ovalen Teller nochmal ein Würstchen dabei. Sie sagte zu meinem Tischnachbarn, dass ich unbedingt den Reis auf der Rückseite des Tellers haben wolle und schloss ihre Rede mit dem Satz: "Ihr seid schon komische Leute". Ich wollte nun eigentlich gar kein Würstchen mehr essen, sondern nur den Reis und überlegte, dass ich wohl aus Höflichkeit auch das Würstchen noch essen müsse. (Dabei erwachte ich mit einem Seufzer und Emme neben mir, jetzt im Wachen, fragte besorgt: "Was ist?" Ich antwortete "Traum") (223 words)

Ein Schwarzer sagte, im Vorbeigehen einen Blick darauf werfend, "beauteful". Ich sagte "It is a beauteful town". Ich liess ihn vorgehen. Er ging durch die Tür in den Zuschauerraum. Die Logenschliesserin, die mich sah, dachte, dass ich seitlich durch ein Treppenhaus woanders hin gehen wollte, und machte mit den Fingern eine Bewegung, die diesen Weg ins Treppenhaus und hinauf andeuten sollte, und schloss direkt vor mir die Tür zum Zuschauerraum. Ich versuchte, sie wieder zu öffnen, aber es war kein Griff daran und sie hörte nicht auf Klopfen.

Er war dabei in der Liste durcheinander gekommen, sodass sich hinterher herausstellte, dass die abgeschickten Briefe alle falsch waren. Fächer waren den Leuten erlassen,, die sie noch machen mussten, und vor allem, Leute, die die Zwischenprügfung längst bestanden hatten, bekamen Briefe, welche Teile der Prüfung sie noch machen mussten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2832 (1993-09-30 - Zürich)Gang durch eine nächtliche Stadt. Ich war wohl hinausgegangen, um spazieren zu gehen, kam durch teils bekannte, teils unbekannte Strassen. Dann ging ich in ein Haus, dessen Hausnummer mir jemand genannt hatte. Es war ein altes winkliges Haus. Ich stieg die Treppen hoch, bis ich zu einer Toilette kam, die direkt am kleinen engen Treppenhaus lag, sodass ich hinein gehen konnte. Als ich fertig war und mich wieder ganz anzog, wurde mir bewusst, dass man aus den Hinterhöfen hineinsehen konnte. Darum machte ich beim Anziehen das Licht aus, dessen Schalter ich vor der Tür fand, die man dazu etwas öffnen musste. Ich hörte im Zimmer direkt gegenüber an der Treppe jemand schnarchen und bewegte mich leise, um ihn nicht zu wecken. Ich musste aufpassen, dass ich alle meine Sachen richtig zusammenkriegte, ehe ich hinausging, weil schon anderes in dem kleinen Raum des alten Hauses herumlag. Einen Beutel mit irgendetwas Essbarem, wohl Obst, den ich nicht mehr brauchte, liess ich ebenfalls dort liegen. Nun musste ich leise die schmalen Treppen herabsteigen, die die Tendenz hatten, zu knarren. Ich stützte mich aus das eiserne Geländer, das einen hölzernen Handlauf hatte, und konnte so fast schwebend, den Boden nur leicht berührend, herabgelangen. Irgendwo standen Leute im Treppenhaus, die miteinander redeten und mein Vorbeigehen ganz selbstverständlich fanden. Ich grüsste sie. Ich hoffte, dass die Tür nicht verschlossen sein würde, als ich unten ankam. Ich sah dass man sie von innen öffnen konnte. Sie erinnerte mich an die Tür des alten Hauses, in dem Emmis Mutter in der Werderstrasse wohnte, und ich sagte wohl auch zu jemand, der da stand, dass das Haus mir vertraut sei. Als die Tür sich öffnete, war es draussen milde und warme Luft wie bei Föhn, und ich sagte auch das noch im Hinausgehen. Die Leute im Haus waren freundlich und vertraut. Ich ging weiter durch die Gassen, die nun wieder ganz unbekannt waren, kam aber schliesslich über eine Brücke und an einen Bahnhof, den ich als die mir bekannte Stadtmitte erkannte. Ich überlegte nun, wie ich nach Hause gelangen könne, da der Weg weit war, und ob ich irgendein Verkehrsmittel finden würde. Es fiel mir ein, dass der Mann, der mir die Adresse des alten Hauses genannt hatte, dort eine Freundin gehabt hätte, und es war nun so, als ob ich sie auch im Traum besucht hätte und wir uns wieder getrennt hätten, und ich erwachte langsam und hörte Emme neben mir schnarchen.

Ihn zu trösten. - Ausführung: Ein Polizist kommt und fragt nach unserem Garten. Es geht um Rosen, die wir vorne am Rand des Weges gehabt haben sollen, weil sie auf den Weg rübergehangen hätten. Die Beschwerde bezog sich aber auf das Jahr 1991 oder gar 1990, was auch der Polizist anscheinend absurd fand. Ich wusste auch, dass nie Dornen von Rosen von uns auf den Weg gehangen hatten. Jetzt, wo der Polizist da war, war der Garten zudem schon für die Übergabe ganz und gar umgegraben, sodass die Szenerie, auf die sich die Beschwerde bezog, garnicht mehr zu sehen war. Dann war Nager da (der Internist Professor Nager aus Luzern). Er trat energisch gegen den Polizisten auf und sagte, es gäbe ganz andere wichtige öffentliche Dinge, gegen die die Polizei lieber auftreten solle. - Dann gab es aber plötzlich einen Umschlag in seinem Verhalten und er weinte, brach in Tränen aus. Es kam heraus, dass er eine Tochter gehabt hatte, die Streit mit einem Nachbarn gehabt hatte, weil dieser auf irgend eine Weise einen lauten Lärm erzeugt hatte. - Sie hatte das Anschwellen des Lärms dargestellt dadurch, dass sie die Hand höher und höher hob. Er hatte noch gedroht, dass etwas Schlimmes passieren werde, wenn ihre Hand oben ankäme, das heisst also ganz in die Höhe gereckt war, und dann hatte er sie, als das tatsächlich geschehen war, einfach erschlagen. - Ich legte den Arm um Nagers Rücken und Schultern, um ihn zu trösten.

Es war im Krieg. Ich kletterte mehrfach an einer Art Schur auf einen Berg hoch. Und hätte dort bleiben können und irgendeine Funktion ausüben. Aber es waren keine Vorräte dort, sodass man dort nicht länger bleiben konnte. Meine Haupterinnerung an den Traum ist das mehrfache Klettern, das teils mit den Füssen auf den Felsen, teils an dem Strick erfolgte, wie beim Strickklettern, was ich zu meinem eigenen Erstaunen recht gut konnte. (Drei Worte kann ich nicht richtig lesen) (99 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2841 (1993-10-05 - London)[Maree Hotel] Aufenthalt im Salon im Gutshaus von Roggow, zugleich Schiff - dann russische Truppen. Jetzt wieder frei. - Wohnen in Zimmer oben. Ich habe Bademantel an. Prinzessin von Bayreuth hat sich angesagt. -Nur wegen einer bestimmten Art von Gebäck. - Wir gehen rauf. Herr v.Oertzen oder Hausherr wartet hinter Vorhang mit Haushälterin. - Es war auch Kreuzlingen bei Binswanger. Ich war im alten Schlafzimmer des Hausherren gewesen. - Bogen in Salonmitte. - Ausführung dieser Stichworte, sofort nach der Stichwortaufzeichnung: Ich war zum Essen mit anderen im Salon des Gutshauses von Roggow. Zugleich war es der Salon eines Schiffes. - Dann hatten russische Truppen es lange besetzt gehabt. Jetzt war es wieder frei. In der Mitte war eine Art Rundbogen, von dem ich überlegte, ob er von Anfang an da gewesen war, oder die Russen ihn gemacht hatten. Ich wohnte oben im Haus in einem Zimmer. - Ich hatte beim Essen einen Bademantel an. Eine Prinzessin von Bayreuth hatte sich angesagt, nur, weil es eine bestimmte Artt von Gebäck - eigentlich eher etwas wie gekochte süsse Klösse - zu Essen gab, die sie besonders gerne mochte. - Herr v.Oertzen, oder beziehungsweise der Hausherr, zog sich zusammen mit einer jungen Haushälterin hinter einen Vorhang in einen abgeteilten Raumteil zurück, um auf die Prinzessin zu warten. Seine Frau war wohl schon tot. - Ich ging - ebenso wie ein anderer Gast, mit dem ich zusammen war - hinauf ins Zimmer, weil ich ja nur den Bademantel anhatte. - Das Ganze war zugleich auch wie in Kreuzlingen bei Binswanger und er der Hausherr. Ich war dort im alten Schlafzimmer des Hausherrn untergebracht, wohl damit ich nicht zu sehr mit den Schizophrenen allein war bei diesem ersten Besuch. Es war aber zugleich sehr deutlich auch die Räumlichkeit und Situation von Roggow. (295 words)

Ich hatte dabei eine ehemalige Assistentin von Gerhard Schmidtchen zur Unterstützung und Dieter Sträuli. Ich liess diese beiden reden, da ich ja schon emeritiert bin, und ging hinter ihnen her, während sie Schmidtchen, der noch im Amt war, und seiner Frau Barbara alles erklärten. - Es ging alles sehr gut - wohl gerade, weil ich mich ganz zurückhielt und die anderen machen liess, was wohl vor allem Barbara sehr imponierte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2847 (1993-10-08 - London)Er war Krieg und Kriegsgeschrei. Die Intellektuellen klagten darüber, was sie verlieren, wenn sie jetzt fliehen oder in den Krieg ziehen müssen, und wie wenig sie mitnehmen können. Aber es war auch klar, dass wir das Kostbarste in unseren Gedanken haben. Ich wurde mir der Schönheit des geplegten Landes bewusst, das ich verlassen musste. Man dachte, nach Norden zu gehen in die Gegend von Hamburg, wo man noch frei war. - Es war eine wunderbare Landschaft und Gegend um uns und gepflegte Städte und Gärten. (85 words)

Er wird bedenklich und sagt, das sei etwas sehr Schlimmes. Er begreift nicht, dass es sich nur um isometrische Übungen handelt, und ich erkläre es ihm durch einen Vergleich etwa mit Übungen, wo man die Füsse abwechselnd anzieht und ausstreckt, um die Fussmuskeln zu entspannen. Er braucht einige Zeit, um den Vergleich zu begreifen, und ich bin im Begriff, zu sagen, dass seine Bedenken eine Projektion sind und eigene Probleme, wohl der frühkindlichen Selbstbefriedigung, zeigen, als ich erwache.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2849 (1993-10-09 - London)[Maree Hotel] Gespräch mit Gadamer, der einen Vortrag bei uns halten sollte. Er sagte, es könne eine Schicksalsentscheidung für ihn sein. Man merkte, dass er innerlich abwog zwischen den Gefahren, die eine solche Reise und Anstrengung für ihn bedeuten könne, und dem inneren Drang, zu reden und da zu sein, und wie dieser Drang, gleichsam die Notwendigkeit, über eine Sache zu sprechen und im Gespräch mit anderen zu sein, stärker war. Er entschied, zu kommen und den Vortrag zu halten. - Dann war er da, und wir gingen, wohl nach dem Vortrag, alle miteinander zum Essen. Er sprach über einen früheren Vortrag, den er bei uns gehalten hatte, gemeinsam mit Blankenburg, und bezog sich auf etwas, was Blankenburg dort gesagt und später geschrieben hatte. Es sei wunderbar ausgewogen und perfekt und stelle eine entscheidende Lösung für vieles dar. - Dann waren wir beim Essen und es ging darum, Käse zu schneiden. Ich fand ein dafür bereit liegendes beilartiges Messer, mit dem es ganz mühelos ging, und zeigte ihm das und machte es für ihn. Alle waren bemüht, so auf ihn und seine Wünsche einzugehen, dass alles mühelos und reibungslos verlief, und man merkte, dass er sich wohl fühlte. - Es war auch vom Tennisspiel die Rede und von der Einstellung in meiner Video-Kamera, die es ermöglicht, den fliegenden Golf- oder Tennisball so zu filmen, dass er auf seinem ganzen Weg durch die Luft scharf zu sehen ist. - Es war dann wie auf einem Golf- oder Tennisplatz in seiner grünen Umgebung und, als ob man den Ball in sanfter und gleichmässiger Folge hin und her fliegen sah, wobei es war wie bei einem Gespräch, wo man sich den Ball zuspielt. Mit diesem sehr befriedigenden Gefühl wachte ich allmählich auf. (287 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2850 (1993-10-09 - London)[Maree Hotel] Ging mit Emme zum Kauf einer ganz leichten Woll-Anzug-Jacke bei einer Verkäuferin und Ladenbesitzerin, die der Steuerberaterin Neininger glich, oder diese - nun aber als Ladenbesitzerin - war. Auf dem Wege sagte ich zu Emme, dass die zuletzt gekauften Jacken zwar wunderschön, aber immer noch zu warm seien, was Emme betrübte. Dann eine Sängerin, die auch ganz leise noch wunderbar melodisch singen konnte, wozu ein besonderer Stimmumfang und eine besondere Stimmkapazität nötig waren, damit auch bei ganz leisem Singen noch alle Töne voll da waren. Dann ein Brief von der Grauen Dame, in dem sie handschriftlich ein Stück aus einem neuen Aufsatz von ihr abgeschrieben hatte, in dem sie mich zitierte, und zwar etwas, was ich über sie und ihre Wissenschaft oder Denkweise gesagt hatte. Sie zitierte mich dabei namentlich, indem sie schrieb:" Herr v.Uslar hat das und das gesagt." Ich hatte in dem Gesagten sie zugleich gelobt und sehr positiv gewertet, aber auch irgendetwas einschränkend negatives gesagt, wie in einer Litreraturkritik oder Musikkritik. Ich entnahm dem Brief, dass sie sozusagen die Fühler ausstreckte. (174 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2851 (1993-10-10 - London)Ich war in der Begleitung von Leuten wie der Burmesin Sanda-Ne-Win, die in ihrem Land eine führende Stellung hatten. Irgendwann wollte ich noch einmal vor einem Abflug hinausgehen und fragte nach der Zeit des Abflugs. Nun gab es eine grosse Verlegenheit und Schwierigkeiten, bis ich begriff, dass der Termin des Abflugs, bei dem ich sie begleiten sollte, streng geheim gehalten wurde aus Sicherheitsgründen und darum auch ihnen selbst wohl nicht bekannt war. Ich merkte auch, dass sie von Feinden und politischen Gegnern umlagert waren, und spürte dann, wie diese versuchten, auch mich zu umgarnen, vielleicht, um etwas zu erfahren. Ich musste bei diesen auf meinen Ausweis neben meine Unterschrift einen Fingerabdruck des kleinen Fingers machen und hatte zuerst Bedenken, bis sie mir regelrecht klar machten, dass das harmlos sei, weil meine Fingerabdrücke sowieso bekannt seien. Ich fragte dann einen jungen Mann, der dort Fingerabdruckspezialist war, ob eigentlich Fingerabdrücke ausser dem Linienmuster noch andere Besonderheiten zeigten. Das war offenbar nicht der Fall, aber er war nun begeistert, weil die Frage ein wissenschaftliches Interesse zeigte, und begann nun mit Begeisterung und Charme von seinen wissenschaftlichen Prinzipien zu sprechen, die sich als die Prinzipien einer jungen Forschergeneration von denen der älteren unterschieden. Es ging nicht um die exakte Genauigkeit einzelner Kausalzusammenhänge, die sich ganz auf kleine einzelne Fakten konzentrierte, sondern um ein globales Erfassen des Zusammenhangs, in dem das Erfassen der Entwicklungsrichtung und des Entwicklungsprinzips eines psychologischen Vorgangs als ganzes wichtig war. Mir schien seine Begeisterung und damit verbundene Zuwendung echt, aber ich wusste, dass ich auf der Hut sein musste, weil er zu der Gruppe der anderen gehörte, die meinen Freunden kritisch gegenüberstanden und ihnen gefährlich waren und mich vielleicht auch aushorchen wollten. - Dann war ich wieder mit Sanda und ihren Leuten zusammen. Alle hatten Blöcke mit Unterschriften von den anderen und deren Fingerabdrücken, so auch dem meinen. Auf einem Blatt von Sanda aber war meine Unterschrift nicht zu entdecken und auch der Fingerabdruck nicht. Es ging nun darum, ob wir das nachholen sollten. Etwas später gab Sanda mir ein Bild von einem Haus oder einer Landschaft zurück, das ich ihr geschenkt hatte. Sie sagte, es gefiele ihr nicht mehr. Irgendetwas beunruhigte sie an dem Bild. Ich war erstaunt, dass sie ein Geschenk einfach zurückgab, wenn es ihr nicht mehr gefiel, merkte aber, dass das dort so üblich war: Ich wollte sie eigentlich fragen, warum sie das tat, wusste aber, dass ihre Antwort sein würde: "Asiaten fragen nicht nach dem Warum."

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2852 (1993-10-10 - London)Ich sehe, wie Vater die Eisschublade aus dem Eisschrank zieht und sie zu Boden fällt, so dass das Eis sich auf dem Boden verteilt. Im gleichen Moment höre ich im Hintergrund in einem anderen Zimmer Tina rufen: "Emme, Emme, lass das" und dann das Klirren einer zu Boden fallenden Eisschublade. Bille kommt bei mir ins Zimmer gelaufen, und ich sage lachend: "Offenbar haben beide Eltern im selben Moment das Selbe getan, nämlich die Eisschublade zu Boden fallen lassen, nämlich Vater hier und Emme, Mutti, wie man deutlich hört, drüben." Bille kniet sich sofort hin, um tatkräftig die Eisreste auf dem Holzfussboden mit den Händen zusammen zu schieben. Ich sage "Lass das, Du kriegst sonst vom Holzfussboden Splitter." Aber sie schiebt eifrig die Eisreste, die inzwischen halb geschmolzen wie zu einem weissen Schaum geworden sind, zusammen. (135 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2853 (1993-10-11 - London)Ich sollte als Geiger mitspielen in einem Orchester wie dem Zürcher Kammerorchester. Ich hatte früher Geige gespielt, und jemand von den Töchtern hatte mir die Stelle verschafft. Aber jetzt hatte ich schon lange nicht mehr Geige gespielt und konnte es wahrscheinlich garnicht mehr richtig. Ich hatte dies Problem immer vor mir her geschoben und gedacht, dass ich eben noch üben müsse. Jetzt war es plötzlich nur noch eine Stunde bis zur Probe und es fiel mir mit Schrecken ein, dass ich nicht geübt hatte:.Ich holte meine Geige und die Noten und merkte zu meinem Entsetzen, dass ich nicht einmal mehr richtig Noten lesen konnte. Es wurde mir auf einmal klar, dass ich unmöglich das noch schaffen könne, und ich sah ein, dass ich das zugeben und sofort den Dirigenten anrufen musste. Emme dachte das schon lange und war sehr dafür. Aber es war doch sehr fraglich, ob der Dirigent so schnell einen Ersatz finden würde. Ich erwachte äusserst beunruhigt und mit dem Gefühl des Schreckens und zugleich aber der Erleichterung, nicht spielen zu müssen und überhaupt nicht Geige spielen zu können, es nie gekonnt zu haben. Aber das Gefühl, versagt zu haben, blieb noch nach dem Erwachen eine Zeit lang bestehen. (201 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2856 (1993-10-12 - London)Ich war in einer Klinik, die im Art-Deco-Stil ausgestaltet war. Das war aber nicht neu geschehen, sondern der alte Stil aus den zwanziger Jahren hatte sich noch erhalten. Es sah alles sehr elegant aus. Ich hatte im Nebenhaus, wo die Küche war, Essen bestellt, das aber längere Zeit nicht kam. Dann kam ein junger Mann, der uns Essen brachte, und fragte, ob ich es innen essen wollte oder aussen, wo es allerdings schon frostig sei. Ich sagte, dass ich schon Essen bestellt habe, worauf er es wieder wegnahm. Nun kam aber überhaupt keines mehr. Später sah ich den Doktor, den ich noch sehen und sprechen musste. Er war mit einem drehbaren Stuhl für einen Patienten beschäftigt, auch dieser in einem Art-Deco-Zeit ähnlichen Stil. Ich wollte ihm helfen, aber der Stuhl drehte sich ganz leicht gleichsam von selber, und meine Hilfe störte eher. Der Arzt glich dem Dirigenten De Stoutz. Dann erwachnte ich langsam. (153 words)

Auf dem Tisch war eine Menge weisses Geschirr, Tassen und Teller, angehäuft, und ich begann, diese zusammen zu schieben, um sie wegzutragen, weil es sehr unordentlich aussah. Emme warf mir einen Blick zu, dies nicht zu tun, weil es Frau Huber irritieren konnte. Dann wachte ich auf. - Vorher eine andere Szene, in der ich weisse, gewaschene und gebügelte und zusammengefaltete Unterhemden auf einen Stapel legte. Als ich sie nehmen und in meine Schublade tragen wollte, merkte ich, dass es viel zu viele waren, und Emme sagte, dass sie von allen Familienmitgliedern stammten und dass das egal sei. Langsam wurde mir klar, dass ich meine Unterhemden ja nach einem besonderen Prinzip, und darum von einer besonderen Marke - Isa - gekauft hatte, weil sie vorne so weit ausgeschnitten sein sein sollten, dass sie bei offen getragenem Hemdkragen nicht herausguckten. Ich musste sie also daraufhin noch einmal durchsehen. (180 words)

Nach einiger Zeit kam er damit in Schwierigkeiten und blieb gleichsam stecken. Ich riet ihm darum, lieber allgemein über das Thema "Beziehung" zu schreiben. So ging es gut, und die Arbeit machte Fortschritte. Eines Tages kam er und sagte, er wolle lieber speziell über die Liebe schreiben. Ich sagte, er solle das ruhig tun, aber sich doch ein Hintertürchen offen lassen, das Thema wider auf "Beziehung" allgemein zu erweitern, damit er nicht in die selben Schwierigkeiten komme, wie früher schon einmal. - So machte er es, und die Arbeit machte wieder gute Fortschritte.

Ich sagte: "Ja, ich habe gestern gar keine Post bekommen." Er sagte: " Es war nur ein Brief da, ein Eilbrief." - Ich sah, wie er die Post in ein dafür gemachtes gitterartiges Gebilde steckte, wo schon ein Brief von gestern für mich dabei war.

Die Strasse ging bergab, so dass man schnell und munter voran kam. Erst allmählich merkte ich, dass der Weg falsch war, weil ich in eine unbekannte Stadtgegend kam. Es wurde mir klar, dass ich das ganze Stück zurückgehen müsse, weil ich in der unbekannten Gegend nicht einen Querweg gehen konnte, da ich mich dann noch mehr verirrt hätte. (99 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2867 (1993-10-18 - Zürich)Ich hatte geträumt und wollte den Traum aufschreiben. Doch jedes Blatt, das ich im Halbdunkeln von dem Stapel Papier neben mir griff, war schon mit anderen Träumen beschriftet. Darum griff ich nach einem anderen Stapel, doch da waren auch alle Blätter, die ich griff, schon beschriftet. Darum beschloss ich, es lieber sein zu lassen, damit ich nicht etwas Aufgeschriebenes unleserlich machte. Vorher hatte ich schon eine Kinderzeichnung bei der Suche nach beschreibbarem Papier in die Hand bekommen. Ich dachte zuerst, sie wäre von Tobi, und hatte das mit Bleistift ganz dünn unten drauf geschrieben. Dann sah ich aber, dass in das farbige gleichsam abstrakte Gemälde, das das Kind gemacht hatte, Buchstaben integriert waren. Das konnte nicht von Tobi sein, denn er kann noch nicht schreiben, ist erst zwei Jahre alt und noch im Kritzelstadium. Dann sah ich, dass oben am Rand der Name des Kindes stand und "11 Jahre". Jetzt erinnerte ich mich, dass ein Kind mir vorhin eine Zeichnung geschenkt hatte. Das Ganze war irgendwie auf Reisen. Andere Szene: Jetzt waren wir zu Hause. Micki, die Katze, war nicht da. Ich sagte: Sicher ist er auf dem Balkon. Da kam auch schon eine weisse Maus, die er offenbar dort aufgestöbert hatte, durch die offene Balkontür hereingelaufen und lief über den neuen Teppich durchs Zimmer in der Richtung zum Flur. Ich sagte, dass wir sie dort zur Haustür herausjagen könnten. Nun kehrte sie aber um und hatte ihrerseits am Rande des weissen Teppichs Ameisen aufgestöbert. Ich sagte: "Erstaunlich, dass die auf dem neuen Teppich nach so kurzer Zeit schon da sind. Die Ameisen frassen in Windeseile ein pulverartiges braunes Krümelfeld, das am Rande der Zimmers auf dem Teppich lag, auf. Ich bewunderte die Geschwindigkeit und Gründklichkeit, mit der sie das konnten, und erwachte. (293 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2868 (1993-10-19 - Zürich)Traum von einem erotischen Wohlgeruch, den die Menschen in sich trugen und der sowohl mit dem Essen wie mit der Sexualität in Zusammenhang stand. Er war zugleich süss im Geruch und Geschmack und ungeheuer aromatisch und intensiv. Eine Frau, die ihn in sich trug, zog die Kleider aus, um sich hinzugeben. Wir berührten uns. Die Intensität des Geruchs und Geschmacks im Traum war enorm stark und erfüllte alles. Es war irgendwie wie auf Reisen. Dann andere Szene: ein Verkehrsunfall. Ein weisses Auto mit Martinshorn schleuderte gleichsam in Zeitlupe über die Strasse und kam dann gegen eine Wand, in die es allmählich, weiter wie in Zeitlupe, ganz eindrang. Zuerst ging niemand hin, weil niemand wusste, was man tun sollte. Ein Mann kam neben mir aus der Haustür und sagte: "Ist er denn nicht hingegangen?" Das bezog sich auf einen Arzt, der bei ihm im Haus gewesen und gerade weggegangen war. Dann kamen Leute, die es offenbar gelernt hatten, und zogen von dem weissen Auto, von dem nur noch das Heck aus der Wand rausschaute, einen ebenfalls weissen Überzug ab. Ich erwachte langsam, vergass fast die Unfallszene, und die Erinnerung an den wunderbaren Geruch war wieder ganz intensiv. (196 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2869 (1993-10-20 - Zürich)Wir stiegen aus einem Fahrzeug aus und gingen in London eine steinerne Treppe hinunter, die voller Menschen war. Bei uns hatten wir einen kleinen faltbaren Kinderwagen. Emme suchte auf einem Koffer nach einem eingeritzten Datum, weil es ein Jubiläum darstellte, Auf der Treppe berührte ich in dem Gedränge der Menschen durch Zufall mit den Beinen die Beine einer Frau, die vor mir ging, sodass eine Zeit lang gleichsam unser Gang identisch wurde weil unsere Unter- und Oberschenkel so aneinander stiessen, dass sie sich im Gehen bei allen Schritten ganz berührten und unsere Körper dadurch in der ganzen Bewegung aneinander geschmiegt waren, wie bei einer Umarmung. Das war ein sehr schönes Gefühl und ich verstärkte ganz leicht den Druck etwas mehr, als es durch das Gedränge erforderlich war. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2870 (1993-10-21 - Zürich)Ich war in einem alten, sehr schön eingerichteten Haus oder Schloss, dessen Einrichtungsgegenstände zugleich sehr archaisch wirkten und sehr gemütlich waren. Es war ein Telephonsystem da, mit alten hölzernen, eckig wirkenden Apparaten, das wie aus dem Anfang der Telephonzeit war. Einmal war es unterbrochen, und auf der Suche nach der Ursache bemerkte ich, dass die Übertragung der Telephonströme an einer Stelle durch zwei, gleichsam jedes einen Winkel bildende, Hölzer ging, die so ineinander liegen mussten, dass sie miteinander Kontakt hatten. Sie hatten aber nicht gerade, sondern gerundete Oberflächen, wie organisch entstandene Formen, die sehr schön wirkten, und bekamen den notwendigen Kontakt nur, wenn sie irgendwie herabhingen und dabei ineinander gehakt waren. Wenn ich sie so hielt, ertönten wieder Worte aus den Hörmuscheln und man konnte Gespräche führen. Ich überlegte nun, wo man sie so aufhängen könne, dass diese Bedingung erfüllt war. Ein Mann sagte, dass die Störung vorher deshalb entstanden sein müsse, weil sie am Ende einer Couch an der Wand hingen, sodass die Leute im Liegen dagegen gestossen hätten. Es war dann noch die Rede davon, dass in diesem Telephonsystem die Ströme auch durch Kohle geleitet wurden, was ich ebenfalls bei meiner Suche nach der Störungsursache entdeckt hatte, und es entstand die Frage, ob die Kohle hier Kraftquelle oder eine Art nötiger Filter für den Strom sei. Dann andere Szene: Wir gingen durch eine Gegend, die aus aufgeschichteten, wunderschönen, organisch wirkenden Steinen in allerlei gerundeten Formen bestand. Die Steine wirkten wie sanft vom Wasser geschliffene Kieselsteine, die aber etwa handgross waren. An einer Stelle war eine Strasse wie ein Hohlweg darin eingeschnitten, an dessen Rand wir besonders schöne, zum Teil tiefschwarze und glänzende Steine dieser Art in organischen Formen fanden, von denen ich einige einsteckte. Nun waren wir aber so an den Rand des Strasseneinschnittes geraten, dass wir in dem Geröll der Steine langsam herabrutschten und es keine andere Möglichkeit gab, als sich ganz herabgleiten zu lassen bis auf den Boden der dort ziemlich tief liegenden Strasse. Die Formen der Steine waren denen der Hölzer, die den Kontakt herstellen mussten, in der vorherigen Szene irgendwie verwandt. (347 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2871 (1993-10-21 - Zürich)Ich war zu Gast im alten Haus von Roggow. Wir waren im Esszimmer und Herr und Frau v. Oertzen wollten in den Keller herabsteigen, wo ihnen in der Küche, die dort war, ein Rezept oder etwas ähnliches gezeigt werden sollte. Es war auch ein Mann da, den sie Herr Wirt nannten. Eine Wendeltreppe führte in diesen Keller herab. Es war eine alte sehr schöne steinerne Wendeltreppe, wie in gotischen Kirchen. Dieses Wendeltreppenhaus hatte ich vorher noch nie gesehen. Ich hatte von da auch Einblicke in Teile des Hauses, die ich noch garnicht kannte, und war davon sehr fasziniert. Bei den Gästen, mit denen ich zusammen auf der Treppe war, war auch Herr Nager, der offenbar auch in Roggow zu Besuch war. Ich hatte meine Sandalen an und die sehr alten Halbschuhe, die schon sehr zerlumpt waren, in der Hand. Da ich mit diesen nicht gut in die Küche gehen konnte, stieg ich wieder hinauf, während die anderen hinabstiegen, um sie in mein Zimmer zu bringen. Um dieses zu erreichen, musste ich über den Hof gehen, fand aber eine neue Glaswand dort, wo man vorher direkt in das Zimmer konnte, sodass man einen Umweg gehen musste, um in das Zimmer zu kommen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2872 (1993-10-22 - Zürich)Wir gingen zur Kur in einen Ort, in dem wir auch im vergangenen Jahr gewesen waren und in dem es mir sehr gut gefallen hatte. Wir waren schon in dem Ort angekommen und auf dem Weg zu dem Haus. Als wir dort ankamen, kamen mir sehr schöne Erinnerungen und ich sagte zu Emme, als wir am Haus am Rande des Ortes entlang gingen: "Hier war unser Zimmer". Emme ging aber an dem Eingang vorbei, und ich dachte, es müsse ein Zimmer mit einem anderen Eingang sein. Emme hatte eine Vorstellung von dem Ort, den wir suchen mussten. Es musste ein Nebenhaus sein, und ich erinnerte mich jetzt, dass die Frau, die uns das erklärt hatte, so etwas gesagt hatte. Der Weg führte noch ein ganzes Stück weiter und schliesslich in den Ort hinein. Wir kamen an eine Villa mit geheimnisvollen runden Formen, die mir sehr gut gefiel. Mir fiel jetzt ein, das die Frau gesagt hatte: "Sie wohnen in der Villa Luz". Ich dachte, dies müsse die Villa Luz sein. Es war ein Haus mir dicken alten Mauern in lauter runden organischen Formen. Aber der Weg, den Emme nach der Beschreibung irgendwie im Kopf hatte, führte noch weiter. Schliesslich fanden wir auf der rechten Seite - die Villa mit den runden Formen hatte an der Linken gelegen - ein Schild mit der Aufschrift "Raum Luz". Unter dem Wort war ein schräg nach unten abgebogener Pfeil, der die Richtung anzeigen sollte. Wenn man es wörtlich nahm, müsste er unter die Erde führen, es wäre also ein unterirdischer Raum. Aber das konnte nicht der Sinn sein. Die Frau hatte gesagt, es wäre ein wunderschöner Raum. Also musste es bedeuten, dass der Weg ein wenig schräg nach links abbiegen würde. Während ich noch überlegte, wie wir ihn finden könnten, erwachte ich. (298 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2873 (1993-10-23 - Zürich)Ich sollte eine Stelle in der Universität bekommen als Angestellter in der Verwaltung. Dafür musste ich mit einer Frau Baumann sprechen und bekam ein transportables Haustelephon in die Hand, mit dem ich sie in ihrem Zimmer erreichen konnte. Sie war aber nicht dort, aber das Telephon war so eingerichtet, dass sich in dem Raum das Mikrophon öffnete, auch wenn niemand da war und man sozusagen den Raum hören konnte an der bestimmten Art, wie sich das Klangbild im Hörer veränderte. Dann andere Szene: ich war in einer Art Schule, wo man zum Schluss, wohl vor Beginn der Ferien, eine Art Schultrunk bekam. Der Hauswart hatte auf dem Fussboden Tetrapackungen, jede mit einem Strohhalm darin, bereit gestellt, aus denen man Saft trank. Es gab halbgrosse, die aber alle schon von anderen genommen waren, und ganze, was mir eigentlich zu viel war. Dann merkte ich aber, dass in ihnen auch nur die selbe Portion war wie in den anderen. Der Hauswart hatte das Getränk einfach in die Packungen geteilt, die er hatte. Ich fand das ganze eine sehr freundliche Geste, und der Saft, wohl eine Art Grapefruchtsaft, schmeckte gut. Zwischen den beiden Szenen war ich wohl kurz wach. (196 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2874 (1993-10-24 - Zürich)Emme und ich wollten in einer fremden Stadt zu einem Konzert gehen, zu dem Emme die Karten bei sich hatte. Ich war auf dem Bett liegend eingeschlafen und wachte erst ganz kurz vor der Zeit des Konzertbeginns auf. Emme war schon in die Stadt gegangen und dachte wohl, dass ich sie bei dem Konzert treffen werde. Ich wusste aber nicht genau, wo das war und wie ich da hinfinden sollte. Ich ging los, fand aber den Weg nur mühsam und kam nur langsam voran, sodass es immer klarer wurde, dass ich nicht rechtzeitig dorthin kommen würde, und unsicher, ob ich den Weg überhaupt finden würde. Ich erwachte beunruhigt. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2875 (1993-10-25 - Zürich)Emme und ich gingen ausserhalb der Stadt auf einer Strasse. Ein Auto kam schräg links aus einer Einmündung oder Abzweigung auf uns zu. Wir wichen nach rechts aus, doch es schien auf der grossen unübersichtlichen Strasse eher auf unsere Seite zu drängen, näherte sich sehr schnell, wobei es bedrohlich immer grösser werdend aussah, und schoss ziemlich dicht an uns vorbei. Ich sagte: "Das war aber knapp". Emme sagte: "Es war auf Deiner Seite", womit sie auch etwa meinte: "Du hättest besser aufpassen müssen". Ich erwachte mir dem Gefühl eines etwas schlechten Gewissens, denn wir hätten eigentlich nicht auf der wegen der schrägen Einmündung hier recht unübersichtlichen breiten Autostrasse gehen sollen (110 words)

Ich fragte sie auch nach den Shiftobjektiven, über die sie aber offenbar keine Unterlagen hatten, weshalb sie die Fragen geschickt übersprangen. Schliesslich fragte ich sie auch nach einer Tasche, wo alle Objektive zusammen reinpassten. Sie erklärten mir nun eine Tasche, die man irgendwie zusammensetzen konnte und wo die einzelnen Taschenteile dann relativ wenig kosteten. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2881 (1993-10-30 - Freiburg)[Schwarzwälder Hof] Es wurde ein Film gezeigt, in dem man berühmte Leute in ihren Wohnwagen sah. Alle Wohnwagen waren mit Plastik-Stoffbahnen umhängt, aus denen man sie herauskommen sah. - Erstaunlich war, dass man sie alle an der Bewegung der Stoffbahnen erkennen konnte, ehe sie überhaupt direkt zu sehen waren. Es war wie eine Art Graphologie der Bewegung des Faltenwurfs. So konnte ich am Schuss schon sehr gut voraussagen, wer kommen werde. Zuletzt war es jemand, der sich mit etwas absichtlich wilden Bewegungen aus den Stoffbahnen befreite. Es war sofort klar, dass das der Tennisspieler Boris Becker sein musste. Er öffnete den Wohnwagen und sagte ironisch: "Nun kommt eine schreckliche Enthüllung". Der ganze Wohnwagen war voller Teddybären und Steifftiere. - Dann zeigte er mir - es war jetzt kein Film mehr, sondern Wirklichkeit - seine Bleistiftsammlung voller schöner alter Bleistifte, die in einem Glas steckten.Ich sagte, dass wir auch viele solche schon auf dem Flohmarkt gesammelt hätten und stolz seien, sie billig bekommen zu haben. Er antwortete, das könne er von seinen nicht sagen. Ich erklärte ihm, dass der Zürcher Flohmarkt so gross sei, dass man, wenn man jedesmal gründlich suche, immer wieder ganz billig sehr schöne Sachen finden könnte. - Er redete mich dann mit dem Namen Chimeno an und sagte gleichzeitig, dass er ein paar Ungarn getroffen habe, die ihm diesen Namen offenbar als meinen Namen genannt hatten. Ich war natürlich gerührt, dass er meinen Namen und mit mir den Namen meiner Urgrossmutter Rafaela Ximeno kannte, und sagte, ich wisse, dass es den selben, bzw. einen genau so klingenden, Namen auch auf Ungarisch gäbe. Ich hatte einmal Ungarn getroffen, die das sagten und mich deshalb auch für einen Ungarn oder Erben ungarischer Vorfahren hielten. (283 words)

Dann Gespräch über einen Reisewecker, den ich ebenfalls schon lange zu kaufen erwog und jetzt zu kaufen beschloss. Sie sagte, dass sie davon nicht aufwachen würde, weil er nicht laut genug für sie wäre.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2884 (1993-11-01 - Freiburg)Es ging um die Frage, wie sehr die dauernde und offensichtliche Benutzung eines Gegenstandes, gegen die nicht eingeschritten wird, zu einer Art Gewohnheitsrecht wird. Es wurde dabei zwischen solchen Benutzungen unterschieden, die mühelos möglich sind, und anderen, die sozusagen den Gegenstand überfordern. - Andere Szene: Es ging um das Sitzen in festen Stuhlreihen in Säulen und die Frage, ob es angenehmer ist, wenn die Stühle auf Lücke stehen, was ich schöner fand, weil man dann besser nach vorne sehen kann. Ich sagte, man müsse dann eben in Kauf nehmen, dass die Reihen rechts und links am Ende eben gleichsam ausgefranst wirkten, weil ja die Stühle versetzt aufgestellt waren. (108 words)

Während ich sie ihm zeige, sind die anderen nicht da. Er fragt mich, als ich schon im Weggehen bin, noch, ob die anderen wissen, wer er ist. Ich bejahe dies. Sie sind eingeweiht.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2887 (1993-11-03 - Zürich)Wir waren in einem Ort, in dem wir meinen Bruder Tessen-Werner treffen sollten, der von Billes Mann Martin mit dem Auto abgeholt wurde. Dann kamen sie an und zu meinem grossen Erstaunen sprach T.-W. mit den anderen Schweizerdeutsch, das er von Ferienaufenthalten her kannte. Es war ein anderer schweizerdeutscher Dialekt, als der hiesige, wohl ein Dialekt aus dem Wallis, wo er in den Ferien war. Dann waren wir auf dem Bahnhof des Ortes, wo ein Schild stand mit der Aufschrift "Ab soundsovielten November Böttingen". Das genaue Datum der Aufschrift habe ich vergessen. ich dachte zunächst, dass das eine Änderung eines Zugfahrplans beträfe, erfuhr dann aber, dass es die Änderung des Namens dieses Ortes betraf, der jetzt noch Witikon hiess, wie es auch auf dem Bahnhofsschild stand. Ich erfuhr, dass das eigentlich ein Name für ein aus mehreren Dörfern zusammengesetztes Ortsgebilde sei, die man jetzt wieder getrennt habe, sodass der Name Witikon hinfällig sei, den es erst seit den dreissiger Jahren gäbe. Es waren auch neue Strassen in dem so erneuerten Ort geplant, von denen eine nach Ruth Dinner Dinnerstrasse heissen sollte. Ich erfuhr, dass sie damit geehrt werden sollte, weil sie dem Ort ein grosses gegerbtes Fell geschenkt habe und solche Felle sehr teuer seien. Ich sagte zu Corinne, die auch da war: "Das war eine Deiner Vorgängerinnen Ruth und Priska waren zusammen da". Andere Einzelheiten des Traumgeschehens habe ich vergessen. Es ging auch darum, welche Schuhe ich anziehen sollte und ich dachte, festere Schuhe anziehen zu müssen, weil wir auch durch eine Landschaft gehen sollten, wo der Boden vielleicht vom Wetter aufgeweicht sein würde.

Ich war mit Belli und Tina, die im Bett lagen, in einem Zimmer, das zu dem, in dem das Fest stattfand, diagonal lag. Die Türen beider Zimmer standen leicht offen. Sie gingen auf den selben Flur. Jemand schob die Tür unseres Zimmers zu, wohl, damit wir nicht gestört würden. Ich wollte aber an dem Fest teil haben und sagte das zu Belli und Tina und meinte, wir sollten die Tür wieder aufmachen. Dann aber kam mir in den Sinn, dass es besser sei, überhaupt in das andere Zimmer rüber zu gehen, und ich überlegte, ob ich zu den beiden sagen sollte: "Wollt Ihr nicht auch tanzen?", war mir aber nicht klar, ob sie das wirklich wollten, oder lieber schlafen wollten. Auf jeden Fall wollte ich hinübergehen in das Fest. Emme war auch schon in dem anderen Zimmer, wo die Musik gerade begann. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwachte ich. (163 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2891 (1993-11-07 - Zürich)Ich wollte etwas auf einem Kopiergerät kopieren. Eine Frau war da, die sagte, sie habe nur ganz wenig zu kopieren, ob sie es schnell vorher machen könne. Ich erlaubte es. Es stellte sich aber dann heraus, dass sie garnicht mit dem Kopiergerät umgehen konnte und unendlich langsam und dazu alles falsch machte. Als sie schliesslich fertig und gegangen war, war das Buch nicht mehr da, aus dem ich etwas kopieren wollte. Ich suchte es verzweifelt überall und kam schliesslich zu dem Schluss, dass die Assistenten, die vorher dagewesen und es auch angesehen hatten, es vielleicht mitgenommen oder als zurückgegebenes Bibliotheksbuch behandelt und versorgt hatten. Ich beschloss, sie zu fragen, weil sie noch im selben Haus beim Essen waren. Ich hatte aber nur einen Bademantel über dem Nachthemd an und hätte mich erst anziehen müssen, um in den Essraum gehen zu können, was viel zu lange gedauert hätte. Die Kopie, die ich machen musste, war aber ausserordentlich wichtig, und ich erwachte sehr beunruhigt. (162 words)

Sie liessen mich dann in ihre Wohnung. Der Eingang war aber so eng, dass man hindurchkriechen musste und fast darin stecken bleib. Ich überlegte auch, ob man sich in der Wohnung, die offenbar nur eine Höhle war, überhaupt umdrehen konnte. Erwachen mit Angstgefühlen. (92 words)

Ich hatte in einem Raum, in den man durch einen anderen gelangte, eine würfelförmige kleine Schachtel aus starker Pappe liegen lassen, auf die ich ein M und eine Krone gemalt hatte. Immer, wenn ich die Schachtel holen wollte, war der Raum durch Seminare oder Vorlesungen besetzt, oder der ihm vorgeschaltete Raum, durch den man hindurchgehen musste. Ich hatte einen Arzt im blauen Kittel, der auch zum Institut gehörte, fragen wollen, was ich da tun könne. Er sprach mich aber an mit den Worten: "Ich habe Ihren Vortrag sehr gut gefunden und er hat mich auch betroffen". Da konnte ich doch jetzt schlecht von der gesuchten Schachtel sprechen. Es war ein lebhafter und sehr freundlicher Betrieb von vielen Studenten in dem Institut. (143 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2896 (1993-11-12 - Zürich)Ich befand mich auf einem Raumschiff im Weltraum. Ein erfahrener Raumfahrer, der uns alles zeigte und erklärte, kletterte an einer Wand hoch, was er wegen der fehlenden Schwerkraft konnte, und meinte, ich könne einfach hinterher klettern. Ich konnte aber an der wenig profilierten Wand mit den Fingern keinen Halt finden und merkte, dass ich doch noch ein Gewicht hatte, sodass es mir nicht gelang, mich an der weissen Wand hoch zu ziehen. Im Laufe seiner Erklärungen hatte der Mann auch viel aus der Geschichte der Raumfahrt erzählt, aber in sehr persönlicher Färbung und Perspektive der Beteiligten. So war auch von Leuten die Rede, die aus irgend einem disziplinarischen oder ähnlichem Grund eigentlich eine Zeit lang nicht in den Weltraum durften, und er redete von einem, dem es gelungen sei, trotzdem mehrfach in dieser Zeit "nach oben", das heisst in den Weltraum zu gelangen. Mir war die ganze Sache noch etwas unheimlich, auch wegen der Frage, wie man eigentlich wieder zurückkommt. Ich erwachte dann langsam. (164 words)

Ich vertrete das eine, wohl Deutschland, irgendwie als Diplomat oder Konsul. Es geht darum, eine Beschiessung zu verhindern, die Zivilisten gefährden würde. Man muss dazu eine Nachricht übersenden, über deren Formulierung ich nachdenke. Plötzlich kommt mir die Lösung. Man muss irgend etwas Bestimmtes, dessen Inhalt ich vergessen habe, in einem positiv statt negativ formulierten Satz sagen. Ich will diesen Satz durchgeben und gehe deshalb zu der Sekretärin in dem Gebäude, in dem ich mich befinde, die das tun kann. Da steht aber eine andere und sagt: "Stören Sie hier nicht bei der Arbeit" Sie hat sich irgend eine Regelung ausgedacht, die uns hindern soll, mit der Sekretärin zu sprechen. Ich werde sehr wütend und sage zu Ihr: "Ich will mit meiner Sekretärin sprechen, sofort. Stören Sie mich nicht dabei. Scheren Sie sich weg, sofort" Ich erwache sehr wütend und zugleich noch beschäftigt mit der Überlegung der richtigen Formulierung des Satzes. (164 words)

Man würde sich da am Anfang auf eine Art Stufe stellen und dann mit dieser den Weg hochgezogen werden. Er hatte aber offenbar selber Bedenken, ob die Behörden das zahlen würden, und sagte, sie würden wahrscheinlich sagen, dass "der Zielort nicht weit genug entfernt" sei. Ich fand die Idee nicht so überzeugend und fand es schade um den schönen Garten- und Treppenweg, der vom Gartentor zum Institut hinaufführt, sagte aber nichts. Dann fragte ich aber, ob man dann denn auch noch normal dort zu Fuss heraufgehen könne. Er machte ein bedenkliches Gesicht und man sah nun wie in einer Vision, wie ein Mann herabkommend dort mit grosser Geschwindigkeit und wedelnden Armen den Weg wie ein Skifahrer von oben herabkam. Die Gefahr, dass der Fussgänger von seinen Armen getroffen und umgerissen würde, war offenbar sehr gross. Ich erwachte und erinnerte den Traum zunächst nicht. Erst als ich mir überlegte, ob ich eigentlich etwas geträumt hätte, fiel er mir wieder ein. (173 words)

Ein Mann, wohl ein Professor, hat eine kleine transportable Orgel mitgebracht, die am Schluss wieder abmontiert werden muss. Er lässt das die Studenten oder Hörer machen, denen er ein oder zwei Schraubenzieher hinwirft, die er in der Tasche trägt. Ich beteilige mich dann daran, habe aber gerade meine Lesebrille nicht bei mir und sage, dass ich es mit dem Tastgefühl versuchen will, die Schrauben zu lösen, was dann auch ganz gut gelingt, da man mit dem Schraubenzieher, der eigentlich etwas zu gross ist, doch ganz gut die Kerben der Schrauben ertasten kann. Schliesslich ist die alte Orgel, die wohl aus der Barockzeit stammt, ganz befreit. Sie hat an ihrer Rückseite noch alten Mörtel, durch den die Schrauben hindurchgingen, war also wohl früher an irgend einer Wand, festgemörtelt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2904 (1993-11-19 - Freiburg)[Schwarzwälder Hof] Gogarten hielt einen theologischen Vortrag auf einer Tagung. Ich war irgendwie der Diskussionsleiter und, da ich spürte, dass die Leute ihm feindlich gesinnt waren, blieb ich, während er sprach, - gleichsam als Schutz - neben ihm stehen. Der Vortrag war anspruchsvoll und wirkte dadurch etwas abstrakt. Ich konnte ihn aber gut verstehen und konnte ihm gut folgen. - Dann kam der Leiter der Tagung, ebenfalls ein Theologieprofessor, und sagte zu Beginn leise zu Gogarten einige gönnerisch herablassende Worte, aus denen man merkte, dass er ihn abkanzeln wollte, weil er zu unverständlich gewesen sei. Gogarten sagte im Weggehen vom Katheder zu mir, ich solle doch auch neben jenem Redner stehen bleiben, und ich tat das, um ihn dadurch zu bremsen, was auch gelang. Ich überlegte nun, ob ich am Schluss etwas sagen solle, und legte mir einige Sätze zurecht, dass doch die Theologie kein Kindergarten sei und nicht bloss zum modischen Reden, und dass man bereit sein müsse, auch anspruchsvolleren Gedanken zu folgen. Dann erwachte ich aber, ehe der andere Redner fertig war. (172 words)

Ich war erstaunt - dachte, eine Nachbarin hätte das vielleicht als Essen für mich hingestellt, wunderte mich aber, dass der Brei dann immer noch kochte, obwohl er nicht auf einer Kochplatte stand. Ich musste aber schnell weg und vergass die Sache. Als ich zurück kam, kochten beide Schalen immer noch. Es war mir ganz rätselhaft, denn es war keine Wärmequelle da. Der Brei bewegte sich blubbernd in sich und warf Blasen auf, etwa wie Lava oder eine entsprechende breiige Masse in den Naturschutzparks mit Geisirn und heissen Quellen. Ich roef Emme herbei, die gerade in der Nähe war, warnte sie noch, nicht davon zu essen, oder es zu probieren, weil es auch ungenissbar oder giftig sein könne, und erwachte dann, ehe das Ganze geklärt war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2906 (1993-11-20 - Freiburg)Traum:Ein Junge oder fast schon ein junger Mann, der zunächst ganz ruhig und friedlich, wenn auch etwas kindlich zu sein scheint, dann aber plötzlich auffällig im Verhalten wird. Er steht auf und schwankt, wird ganz weich und kann nicht mehr stehen. Ich ergreife ihn und lasse ihn auf einen Liegesessel nieder, der gerade da steht. Die Leute, seine Familie, halten ihn für hysterisch. Es scheint mir aber eher eine neurologische Sache zu sein. - Sie sagen, dass er auch gewalttätig werden kann. Er bleibt nicht lange liegen, sondern kriecht eigenwillig über den Boden, der jetzt uneben und hügelig ist wie ein ausgetrocknetes und erstarrtes, hart gewordenes Schlammfeld. Er kriecht über diesen unebenen Boden an den Rand des sehr grossen Raums, der eigentlich wie im Freien ist. Ich stehe dort irgendwo und bewache ihn. Die anderen Kinder der Familie schlafen alle aneinandergedrängt auf einer Art Podest, das das Bett der Familie ist. Dort steht auch der Sarg des Vaters, ein grosser schwarzer Holzsarg, in dem der tote Vater liegt und neben dem die kleinste, sonst ganz munter wirkende jüngste Tochter liegt. - Nachdem ich gesehen habe, dass der Junge am Rand ruhig liegen bleibt, begebe ich mich auf mein Bett, das auch irgendwo steht. Dann wird der Junge aber wieder munter, kommt heran und erklärt mir, dass er mir zeigen will, wie gross seine Kräfte sind und wie sehr er alles kaputt macht. Ich habe irgendeinen Gegenstand bei mir, der mir lieb und wert ist. Es ist wie ein längliches Holzbrett, auf dem wie Stuck hübsche Dinge angebracht sind. Seine Hände beginnen nun, sich wie Schraubstöcke um diesen Gegenstand zu schliessen, und er wird ihn zerbrechen. Ich versuche, seine Hände auseinander zu ziehen, was aber kaum möglich ist, und schreie ihn an: "Lass das bleiben, lass das bleiben - sonst schlag ich auf Dich." Ich überlege, dass ich ihm einen kräftigen Schlag versetzen muss, damit er zur Vernunft kommt. Im Erwachen überlege ich noch, ob er nicht eine Scläfenlappenepilepsie hat, und dass man mit ihm zum Neurologen gehen muss. - Vorher waren andere Traumszenen: Ich hatte zugesagt, stellvertretend für einen irgendwie behinderten Mann morgen um acht Uhr morgens eine Vorlesung zu halten. Dann fiel,mir aber ein, dass ich selbst um diese Zeit eine Vorlesung hatte - wohl über den Traum. Tina war bereit, diese eigene Vorlesung für mich zu halten. Nun wurde es aber Zeit, dafür aufzustehen, und ich merkte, dass Tina noch schlief. Überlegte, dass ich sie wecken müsse, und sah, dass es schwierig sein würde, an das Zimmer heran zu kommen, in dem sie schlief. (426 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2909 (1993-11-21 - Freiburg)Ich habe einen handschriftlichen Brief von der Grauen Dame, den ich auf den Computer kopieren will. Der Brief - selber schon eine Kopie - ist wenig kontrastreich, aber ich denke, das kann ich ja später noch bei der Weiterverarbeitung ändern. Er zeigt ihre lebhafte Handschrift. Manches ist korrigiert, durchgestrichen, geändert. Es ist ein interssantes Schriftbild. Als ich es aber nun drucken will, tut der Computer nichts. Wenn ich auf den Knopf der Fernbedienung drücke, wackelt er bloss - wohl durch den Impuls, den er bekommt, und das Anspringen der Druckmaschine, aber er druckt nichts. Ich probiere alle Tasten und Stöpsel und Befehle immer wieder durch. Es geht nichts. Emanuela kommt hinzu und bietet sofort an, den Brief auf ihrem IBM-Computer zu drucken. Ich sage, dass das nicht geht, weil es ein anderes Programm ist als auf meinem Macintosh-Computer. Nun kommt auch Franz hinzu und gibt mir verschiedene Ratschläge. Sie sagen, ich solle den Brief abtippen, dann würde es sicher gehen. Ich sage, dass doch der Computer druckt, was man ihm gibt. Franz meint, dass man das nicht wissen kann und er vielleicht lieber Schreibmaschine hat. Ich will aber doch gerade die Handschrift kopieren. Franz rät, den Techniker zu holen, und Emanuela stimmt zu. Ich sage, das könne es nicht sein, denn der Computer habe gerade vorher noch etwas für mich gedruckt. Plötzlich kommt mir schlagartig die Erleuchtung, warum es nicht gegangen ist, und ich erkläre ihnen dies. Der Kontrast auf der Vorlage war zu gering, und der Computer konnte das einfach nicht lesen, weil er den schwachen Kontrast nicht erkennen konnte. - Ich muss bloss den Brief auf einem Xeroxgerät noch einmal richtig kopieren, und dann wird der Computer es lesen können. Ich sage den beiden, dass der Computer bloss einen Schatten oder Nebel gesehen hat, den er natürlich nicht drucken konnte. Ich eile zum Computer, um die Sache noch mal zu beginnen und erwache.

Ich hab sie meiner Mutter geschickt." - Folgende Vorgeschichte: Ich hatte unsere Schnapsgläser- es waren polyederartig gebildete Gläser mit vielfältigen wie geschliffenen Flächen und breitem Rand - in der Küche in den Ausguss gestellt, wo schon genau solche Gläser standen, die Susi dort hingestellt hatte. Ich hatte die unseren beim Aufräumen gefunden und dort sozusagen geparkt, weil ich gerade keinen Platz dafür fand. Die Küche hatten wir offenbar gemeinsam. Susis Mutter - oder war es die Schwester? - hatte sie gebeten, ihr solche Gläser zu besorgen und sie hatte einfach die geschickt, die sie dort hingestellt hatte, und die unseren für dazugehörig gehalten. Erst jetzt hatte sie den Irrtum bemerkt. Ich lachte und sagte, dass ich sowieso Mühe gehabt hätte, sie unterzubringen. Wir hatten aus ihnen oft Eierlikör getrunken, wobei das breite, weich wirkende Glas ein angenehmes Gefühl an den Lippen erzeugt hatte. Ich beschloss darum, wieder solche zu kaufen und hoffte, dass es noch solche gab. Erwachen mit dem Gefühl des Eierlikörgeschmacks und des sich weich anfühlenden Glasrandes in der Erinnerung im Mund und dem Bedürfnis, Eierlikör in der Küche aus der Flasche zu trinken, die dort neben anderen Flaschen am Boden steht.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2915 (1993-11-26 - Zürich)Ich musste eilig irgendwo hin und sah beim Überqueren der Strasse noch aus dem Augenwinkel bei den Leuten, die hinter mir über die Strasse gingen, eine ältere Frau, die im Begriff war, sich zu erbrechen. Da ich aber keine Zeit hatte und viele Leute da waren, schaute ich mich nicht richtig um, sondern lief eilig weiter. Nun hörte ich aber eine Stimme meinen Namen rufen: "Herr von Uslar!". Ich drehte mich um, sah, dass es die Frau war, und ging zu ihr. Sie sagte: "Ich brauche Hilfe. Ich bringe es nicht richtig raus" Sie wollte, dass ich sie halte, damit sie sich besser vorbeugen konnte, und ich tat dies. Sie sagte noch : "Sie sind ja regelrecht vor mir weggelaufen". Es war eine Hörerin aus der Vorlesung. Sie musste sehr würgen und es schüttelte sie dabei und ich bedauerte sie. Als ich sie so hielt, sah ich, gleichsam nebenbei, dass sie einen dicken Tweedwollmantel mit Fischgretmuster anhatte, der demjenigen glich, den ich in den letzten Tagen anhatte, als es sehr kalt war. Nach einer gewissen Zeit hatte sie wohl alles erbrochen und es schien ihr besser zu gehen. Die Zeit war nun für mich sehr knapp geworden, um den Termin zu erreichen, zu dem ich musste, und ich erwachte. (209 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2916 (1993-11-27 - Zürich)Ich betrachtete in einem Schaufenster immer wieder mal, wenn ich dort vorbei kam, ein Glas, das, gleichsam senkrecht geteilt, auf der einen Seite glatt war, auf der anderen ein unregelmässiges hereingeschliffenes oder -geäztes Muster hatte, das sich auf Dante bezog. Es war aber sehr teuer. Eines Tages ging ich mit Emme in das Geschäft, um mir einmal das Glas zeigen zu lassen. Das Verkaufsgeschäft lag aber in einem anderen Haus als das Fenster, in dem das Glas stand. Das Geschäft hatte auch Bilder, und ich hatte gesehen, dass es auch ein ähnliches, relativ abstrakt wirkendes Bild gab, das Dante zeigt, wohl vom selben Künstler, der, glaube, ich Max Hirsch oder ähnlich hiess. So liess ich mir zuerst, gleichsam, um mich an die Sache heran zu tasten, dieses Bild zeigen. Während der Verkäufer es suchte, hörte ich ihn von hinten sagen, dass sie auch noch andere Bilder von Dante hätten, wo er besser zu erkennen sei. Ich sagte, es gehe mir garnicht um naturtalistische Dante-Bilder, sondern eigentlich um ein Glas, was er aber natürlich nicht verstand. Da er lange Zeit mit dem Suchen verbrauchte und die Zeit knapp war, überlegte ich, ob ich inzwischen schnell zu dem anderen Haus gehen und die Vase holen sollte, in die das eigentlich gesuchte Bild geschliffen oder geäzt war. Als ich vor das Haus gegangen war, in dem das Verkaufsgeschäft war, merkte ich aber, dass der Weg zu dem anderen Haus zu lang war, um nur so schnell zwischendurch, während er suchte, dahin zu gehen. Ich beschloss also, in den Laden zurückzugehen, bemerkte aber, dass der direkte Weg durch einen kleinen reissenden Bach abgeschnitten war, der zu breit war, um einfach durch einen grossen Schritt darüber hinweg zu kommen. So musste ich in der nächtlich wirkendem Landschaft einen Umweg machen, wobei ich merkte, dass es empfindlich kalt war, während ich aber nur eine kurze Hose anhatte. Ich überlegte, dass im Gepäck, das ich bei mit hatte, eine lange wärmere Hose war, und dachte darüber nach, ob ich sie vielleicht zwischendurch, zum Beispiel in einer Toilette, anziehen sollte. Der Rückweg in das Geschäft zog sich dabei länger hin, weil der reissende Bach einen grösseren Umweg erforderte, und ich erwachte mit einem Seufzer. (366 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2917 (1993-11-27 - Zürich)Ich fahre im Bus nach Hause, in dem ich hinten auf der letzten Bank sitze, und habe die Korrekturbögen eines Artikels auf dem Schoss, den ich geschrieben habe. Später habe ich sie wieder weggesteckt. Nun steigt ein jüngerer Mann ein, setzt sich mir gegenüber und zieht ebenfalls Korrekturbögen heraus, in denen er liest. Es sind viele. Offenbar hatte er ein ganzes Buch geschrieben. Ich kann Titel und Inhalt nicht erkennen, weil die Schrift ja für mich überkopf ist., denke aber, dass es ein medizinisches Buch sein könnte. Er ist müde und legt die Füsse neben mich auf die Bank, zieht sie aber, als ich zur Seite rücke, zurück und rollt sich irgendwie auf seiner Bank zusammen. Wir fahren jetzt durch die Cäcilienallee, und ich drücke kurz vor dem Elternhaus den Knopf, um dort auszusteigen. Ich stehe auf und versuche, in meine Schuhe zu schlüpfen, aus denen ich mit den Füssen herausgefahren war, sodass ich barfuss auf dem Boden des Busses stehe. Während ich mit dem einen Fuss gut in den Schuh komme, habe ich bei dem anderen, in den ich mit dem Fuss im Stehen hereinschlüpfen will, Schwierigkeiten, als wenn er zu klein geworden ist. Inzwischen fährt aber der Bus, ohne anzuhalten, am Elternhaus vorbei. Offenbar hat der Fahrer das Zeichen nicht wahrgenommen. Ich denke, dass ich ja an der nächsten Haltestelle aussteigen und das Strassenstück zurückgehen kann. Der Bus fährt aber sehr schnell, und das Strassenstück kommt mir zu lang vor. Auch kommen mir die Häuser am Strassenrand langsam unbekannt vor. Wir müssen jetzt gleich das Ende der Cäcilienallee erreicht haben, wo die Linie von der Strasse in den Wald abbiegt. Vielleicht funktioniert der Signalknopf garnicht. Ich beschliesse, nach vorne zu gehen und direkt mit dem Fahrer zu reden, und erwache. (292 words)

Es ist in der Erinnerung nicht mehr ganz klar, ob es die Familie des Bundespräsidenten Richard, oder die seines Bruders, des Philosophen Carl Friedrich war.

Ein Mann und eine Frau schenkten Kaffee und Milch ein und waren dabei so ungeschickt, dass sie sich selbst, die Leute und den Tisch mehrfach mit Milch übergossen. Als der Mann an unseren Tisch kam, sagte ich zu ihm, er solle die Milch in einer grösseren Entfernung vom Tisch eingiessen. Das tat er, übergoss dabei aber ungeschickt sich selber. Als er Milch in meine Tasse goss, in der sich schon Kaffee befand, hörte er überhaupt nicht auf mit Giessen und ich rief "Aufhören, Aufhören! " Er wiederholte das Wort "Aufhören", goss aber weiter und hörte erst nach einer längeren Reaktionszeit auf. (130 words)

Sie sprang herab und umfasste mich dabei wie umarmend, um das Gleichgewicht nicht zu verlieren. Sie war in ihren Verhalten charmant, anders als früher, wo sie eher schwierig und abweisend war. Irgendwie war es in der Räumlichkeit auch eine Situation und Atmosphäre wie in dem Vogteizentrum in Herrliberg, wo gestern die Diskussion über das Wesen der Sinne stattfand. In der Erscheinung der Sekrtärin in dem Traum war irdgendwie auch die Tanzlehrerin Frau Metzenthin enthalten, die an der Diskussion im Vogteizentrum teilnahm. (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2921 (1993-12-01 - Zürich)"Herr Landgrebe, sie wollten mich sprechen" - mit diesen Worten sprach ich einen Mann an, der nach mir gefragt hatte. Es war irgendwo in einem Ort, wo wohl eine Tagung oder ein Kongress stattfand. Ich hatte gehört, dass der Philosoph und Phänomenologe Landgrebe, der dort war, mich sprechen wollte. Dann sah ich einen Mann mit anderen Leuten durch den Raum gehen und hörte ihn sagen. "Ich muss noch den Uslar sprechen" Darauf ging ich zu ihm und sprach ihn mit dem oben genannten Satz an: "Her Landgrebe, sie wollten mich sprechen. Uslar ist mein Name" Daraufhin sagte er. "Ich wollte Sie fragen, ob sie sich auch erinnern, wie die Soldaten im Kriege immer Maroni assen". Mir kam, als er das fragte, nur eine ferne Erinnerung. Ich hob an, zu antworten und sah an seinen Augen, die mit ausdruckslosem Blick zu schauen schienen, dass er wohl blind war. Ich sagte etwas. Er hörte aber garnicht richtig zu. Es war jetzt ein Mädchen mit Sommersprossen im Gesicht, zu der ich sprach und die ich gefragt hatte. Sie trat so dicht an mich heran, dass ich befürchtete, Emme, die im Hintergrund stand, könne eifersüchtig werden. Das Mädchen sprach gleichzeitig mit vielen der sie umgebenden Leute, die sie teilweise auf Englisch, teilweise auf Französich, teilweise auf Deutsch ansprach, dabei fast übergangslos zwischen diesen Sprachen wechselnd, die sie alle fliessend sprach. Sie reagierte aber gar nicht mehr auf meine Antwort, und ich dachte, dass ich mich jetzt auch verabschieden könnte, wobei ich erwachte. Die Wandlung von Landgrebe zu dem Mädchen geschah so selbstverständlich, dass ich sie im Traum garnicht als solche bemerkte. Erst nach dem Erwachen wunderte ich mich darüber. (275 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2924 (1993-12-03 - Zürich)Ich war in der Uni vor Beginn der Vorlesung noch irgendwo hin gegangen, wo ich etwas erledigen musste. Als ich danach in den Hörsaal kam, strömte mir eine Menschenmenge von Demonstranten entgegen, die gerade aus dem Hörsaal heraus kamen. Sie hatten im Hörsaal eine Flüssigkeit ausgeschüttet und zerstückelte Zigaretten darin verteilt. Meine Hörer hatten sich aber nicht einschüchtern oder vertreiben lassen und hatten sich nur in den hinteren Teil des Hörsaals zurückgezogen, wo sie nun auf die Vorlesung warteten. Ich sagte, dass ich diese nun beginnen wolle, weil ich sah, dass es möglich war, in den nicht überschwemmten Teil des Hörsaals auzuweichen, und die Hörer stimmten dem zu. Das Katheder, das irgendwie zur Seite geschoben war, stürzte um, aber es war mir egal, da ich die Vorlesung auch frei halten konnte. Als ich gerade beginnen wollte, merkte ich, dass ich etwas Zerbrochenes im Munde hatte, und beförderte dessen Teile unauffällig mit der Zunge heraus. Es war nicht ganz klar, ob es ein zerbrochener Zahn war, oder Teile von irgend etwas anderem, das in den Mund geraten war. Ich fuhr schnell mit dem Finger über die Zähne und hatte das Gefühl, dass noch alle da waren. Ich beschloss, das nach der Vorlesung zu untersuchen und nun zu beginnen, und erwachte. (209 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2926 (1993-12-05 - Zürich)Ich hatte eine Art Festzelt gekauft, in dem man Partys feiern und Gäste empfangen konnte. Es war viel zu teuer und ich war sehr bedrückt. Vor allem konnte man sich ausmalen, dass das metallene Gestänge, das es aussen umgab, ganz leicht gestohlen werden konnte, denn es bestand aus zusammengesetzten Stangen. Das Zelt war rechteckig und wurde auf der Strasse auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite aufgestellt, wofür auch eine Grube ausgehoben wurde. Ich befürchtete auch, dass die Nachbarn, die auf der gegenüberliegenden Strassenseite wohnten, sich beschweren würden. Aber auf unserer Seite der Strasse konnte es nicht stehen, weil da die Strassenbahnschienen waren. Es war eine Situation wie vor dem Elternhaus in Schwerin, wo an der gegenüberliegenden Seite Girsewalds wohnten, deren Grundstück von einer Mauer umgeben war, neben der kein Fusssteig verlief, wohl weil die Strasse dafür zu schmal war. Ich erwachte schliesslich sehr bedrückt wegen der unnötigen grossen Geldausgabe aus dem Traum und war froh, dass es nur ein Traum war. Das Bedrücktheitsgefühl hielt aber an, und ich vermutete, dass es von Föhnwetter kommen könne. (173 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2927 (1993-12-05 - Zürich)Wir waren in Sankt Valentin bei Frau Trenkle. Ihr Mann war erst vor kurzem gestorben. Es war kurz vorher eine Reportage mit wunderschönen Bildern von Sankt Valentin in der Zeitung erschienen. Herr Trenkle war dort sozusagen als weiser alter Mann beschrieben, was Frau Trenkle komisch fand. Wir spielten dort mit einem Geldspielautomat. Man musste Zehnrappenstücke hineinwerfen und solche kamen auch wieder heraus. Irgendwann war uns das Geld ausgegangen, was wir auch zu Frau Trenkle sagten. Dann hatte ich aber einen ganzen Umschlag voller Zehnrappenstücke bei meinen Sachen im Schrank gefunden. Es war so, als ob wir auch in Sankt Valentin wohnten. Es kam auf einmal eine grosse Menge Geld aus dem Automaten heraus, dabei auch fremde Münzen wie Lire-Stücke und zum Teil auch verbogenes Geld. Es zeigte sich, dass Frau Trenkle wusste, dass das manchmal aus dem Automaten kommt. Der Widerspruch, dass wir in Freiburg Schweizer-Geld benutzten fiel mir im Traum nicht auf (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2928 (1993-12-06 - Zürich)Ich sitze in Trolleybus auf der Fahrt in die Stadt., wobei der Bus zugleich auch wie eine Strassenbahn ist. Kurz vor der Schlyfi sagt der Fahrer durch den Lautsprecher: "Wir werden unter schweren Artilleriebeschuss geraten. Sie müssen nicht mitfahren. Sie können aussteigen". Es ist offenbar Krieg. Ich überlege, dass es wirklich nicht nötig ist, sich dieser Gefahr auszusetzen, und dass ich vielleicht aussteigen und mit dem entgegenkommenden Bus zurückfahren sollte. Der Fahrer sagt "Achtung", als wir im Begriff sind, an der Schlyfi um die Bergnase zu fahren. Da ich ganz vorne sitze und ihn ansprechen kann, sage ich: "Und was ist, wenn man raus will?", da er nicht anhält. Er ist ganz erstaunt, denn alle Leute bleiben wie Schlachtlämmer sitzen und er ist diese Frage garnicht gewohnt. Er sagt irgend etwas, dass er anhalten könne. Es kommt mir noch in den Sinn, dass es fraglich ist, ob überhaupt ein entgegenkommender Bus kommt, mit dem ich zurückfahren kann, und dass ich vielleicht zu Fuss zurückgehen muss. Ich bin aber entschlossen, auszusteigen. Ich erwache mit starken Kopfschmerzen (175 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2929 (1993-12-07 - Zürich)Ich war in eine Klinik gegangen, wo ein Heilgymnastik- oder Physiotherapiekurs stattfand, den ich schon oft besucht hatte. Diesmal war ich in den Raum gegangen, wo er stattfand, um dort Leute zu sehen, weil ich eine depressive Stimmung hatte. Ich war auch schon umgezogen, musste aber vor Kursbeginn wieder hinausgehen, weil ich noch irgend einen anderen Termin hatte, wo ich offenbar auch im Trainingsanzug hingehen konnte. Ich betrachtete noch versunken das Gesicht eines Mädchens, das dort mit den anderen Leuten auf den Kursbeginn wartete, und ging auf diese Weise erst in dem Moment durch die Tür hinaus, wo schon der Physioptherapeut, den ich vom Ansehen kannte, hereinkam. Ich grüsste ihn im Vorbeigehen. Später am Abend wollte ich in den Raum zurück, um meine Kleider zu holen. Man musste, um den Raum zu finden, zunächst durch einen langen Flur gehen, der von der Eingangshalle der Klinik nach links abzweigte, dann am Ende dieses Ganges in einen weiteren Gang im rechten Winkel nach rechts abbiegen. An der Stelle der Abbiegung stand eine Art Empfangstisch der physiotherapeutischen Abteilung. Dann konnte man in dem abbiegenden Gang das Zimmer, um das es sich handelte, daran erkennen, dass ein Schild mit der Aufschrift "Garderobe" darüber stand. Ich fand diesen Raum aber nicht und bekam Zweifel, ob ich überhaupt in der richtigen Etage war, ging noch einmal zurück zu der Abzweigung, fand den Tisch aber nicht. Dann fiel mir ein, dass er vielleicht am Abend nach Dienstschluss weggeräumt wurde. Ich ging wieder in den Gang zurück. Ein Mädchen, das weiter hinten im Gang war, rief mich mit Namen an: "Herr von Uslar", und fragte, ob sie mir helfen könne. Wahrscheinlich war es eine Studentin, die mich kannte. Ich sagte, dass ich die Garderobe suche und schon noch finden werde. Nun war es aber schon allmählich so dunkel geworden, dass ich die Schilder über den Türen kaum noch lesen konnte. Ich ging ein grosses Stück den Gang entlang, der nun zu einer Strasse mit alten vorkragenden Fachwerkhäusern geworden war, die teilweise von den Einwohnern selbst repariert wurden, die oben am Giebel in einer Art Netz an Stelle eines Gerüstes schwebten und die Füllung des uralten Fachwerkes auswechselten, weil sie defekt geworden war. Ein anderes Haus, dessen Bewohner, der dort ein Geschäft hatte, ich kannte, war schon ganz ausgebessert. Ich fand aber immer noch nicht das gesuchte Schild und merkte, dass ich schon zu weit in die Gasse gegangen war. So ging ich zurück und kam schliesslich an eine Tür die ich für die richtige hielt Es war jetzt wohl wieder der Gang der Klinik. Gang und Strasse waren irgendwie identisch. Hier erwachte ich.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2930 (1993-12-08 - Zürich)Ich verglich Bahn- und Busfahrpläne, weil ich durch Schaffnerdienste Geld dazuverdienen wollte. Es zeigte sich aber, dass sich Bahn und Bus immer zeitlich so überschnitten, dass nur eins von beiden in Frage kam. Die Bahn schien mir geeigneter, weil sie weniger in Gefahr war, im Verkehr stecken zu bleiben. Zuletzt blieb von den Busfahrplänen nur noch eine Zeit am Samstag oder Sonntag übrig, zu der keine Bahnen fuhren. Es zeigte sich aber, dass man danach nicht mehr aus der Stadt nach Hause gekommen wäre, weil es zu der Zeit gar keine fahrenden öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel mehr gab und wir ja kein Auto haben. In einer anderen Traumszene war ich mit Emme in einem Stadtviertel, in dem in den Schaufenstern lauter Fenster ausgestellt zu ein schienen. Auch hier schien es für uns ums Geldverdienen zu gehen, wobei man offenbar Fenster brauchte. Es zeigte sich aber, dass alle Fenster ohne Rahmen waren. Wir waren in die Gegend der Glaser geraten, die nur Gläser ohne Rahmen in ihren Schaufenstern ausstellten. Es war eine äusserst labile Sache. Das sahen wir, als ein Mann kam, der in sein verschlossenes Geschäft gehen wollte. Als er es öffnete, war alles so voller Gläser, dass man sich fragte, wie er überhaupt heil hindurch kommen könne. Gleichzeitig, das heisst wohl während der Zeit, in der ich die Fahrpläne anschaute, war ein Mann bei uns, der alte Teekessel aus Messing oder Kupfer reparieren sollte, die ich wohl vom Flohmarkt hatte und die eine Sammlung bildeten. Er machte das sehr langsam und ich machte mir Sorgen über die Kosten, hoffte aber, dass er keinen zu hohen Stundenlohn berechnen würde. Zuletzt zog er einen Docht in einen sehr schönen Messingkessel ein, den er dadurch zu einer Art Lampe frisierte. Ich sagte, dass wir das nicht schön fänden. Er sagte, dass er es auch nicht schön fände. Er hätte es nur mal ausprobieren wollen. (310 words)

Diese beiden Sätze standen auf einem Blatt, auf dem oben noch Vorgedrucktes war, und waren so auf dem Blatt verteilt, dass es wie ein Gutachten aussah. Die Sätze standen da anstelle eines Gutachtentextes, und das Blatt lag zwischen lauter Lizentiatsgutachten, die Walter Schelling für mich geschrieben hatte. Ich hatte schon die Note 6 darunter geschrieben, ohne das Blatt noch einmal zu lesen. Es musste eine Verwechslung sein. Irgend ein Blatt mit einer Bemerkung zur Arbeit war anstatt des Gutachtens in den Stapel geraten. Emme und Schelling und ich sassen zusammen in einem Zimmer und beschäftigten uns mit der Versorgung der Gutachten. Ich überlegte kurz, was ich tun sollte, als mir das Blatt mit dem Satz plötzlich auffiel. Sollte ich nichts tun und annehmen, dass es niemand merken würde, um Walter Schelling nicht noch einmal mit der Sache befassen zu müssen? Nein, das ging nicht, weil es doch jemand im Dekanat auffallen könnte. Ich überlegte, dass ich zu ihm sagen wollte. "Hier stimmt irgend etwas nicht. Da ist wohl etwas verwechselt worden. Es ist ja garnicht Dein Gutachtenstil", und erwachte. (193 words)

Ein Mann, der vorbei kommt, sagt, man wisse ja hinterher doch nicht richtig, was auf dem Bild sei, wenn man es so betrachte. Ich sage, dass ich die Augen schliessen und das Bild beschreiben wolle, und er solle es kontrollieren, ob ich es richtig in Erinnerung habe. Dann beginne ich, mit geschlossenen Augen das Bild in seinen Einzelheiten zu beschreiben, wie die Farben der Kleider, die die Frau anhat, und die Gegenstände, die man auf dem Bild um sie herum sieht. Es zeigt sich dann, als ich die Augen wieder öffne, dass ich doch sehr viele Einzelheiten richtig behalten habe. Anderes aber ist etwas anders, als ich es beschrieben hatte, worüber ich erstaunt bin.

Ich war schon dort gewesen und wusste, dass man von dort eine wunderschöne Aussicht hatte. Er sagte, dass er zur Zeit viel zu tun habe, weil seine Techniker in ein neues Gebäude ziehen würden, in dem alle Technik der Klinik beisammen sei. Ich sagte, dass sie den schönen Ausblick da oben sicher vermissen würden, hatte aber dann das Gefühl, dass ich es lieber nicht hätte sagen sollen, weil es wie eine Einmischung in seine Angelegenheiten klingen konnte. Ich sagte noch, dass ich bemerkt habe, dass die Heizung falsch funktioniere und nachts nicht abschalte, sondern immer wärmer werde. Ich hätte deshalb schon die Heizungstechniker benachrichtigt. Er hatte diese Fehlfunktion der Heizung auch schon bemerkt. (151 words)

Zuerst begleitete mich eine Schwester, die wohl zufällig desselben Wegs ging. Sie sagte, dass Hoffmanns Kindersalbe so gut sei. Sie sei überall in den Zimmern der Professoren zu finden. Sie spielte damit wohl darauf an, dass diese sie zum Behandeln ihrer eigenen Hände benutzten, weil sie so mild sei. Ich beschloss, die Salbe auch zu nehmen. Dann kam ich in einen im schrägem Winkel abbiegenden Korridor und bemerkte, dass er nicht weiter führte, sondern vor den Glastür eines Raums endete, die sich auch sofort öffnete. Heraus kam ein Professor, der mich sofort herein zog und sagte: "Kommen Sie rein, Herr Jung". Dann zeigte er auf die wunderschöne Aussicht, die man aus der grossen Glaswand hatte, und sagte etwas über die schönen Farben, wies dann auf einen Stuhl, der wie der seine an diesem schönen Aussichtsfenster stand, und sagte: "Nehmen Sie Platz. Was führt sie zu mir?" Ich antwortete: "Nichts. Ich bin nicht Herr Jung und bin hier blos spazieren gegangen." Ich überlegte dann noch im Erwachen, dass es vielleicht der Romanist Marc René Jung sein könne, auf den er wartete. (196 words)

Sie sagt am Telephon, dass dieser sich noch bei Peterlis befände, mit denen sie offenbar vor einiger Zeit eine Reise gemacht hat. Ich gehe darum zu diesen, um ihn zu holen. Ihr Haus sieht im Traum anders aus als in Wirklichkeit, ohne dass mir dies im Traum deutlich wird. Ich muss eine Innentreppe hochgehen, weil sie in der oberen Etage wohnen. Die Treppe endet oben in einen ganz engen von Wandschränken gebildeten Durchgang, von dem ich mir überlege, ob überhaupt ein Mensch hier durchkommt. Dieser Durchgang ist zudem durch ein wurstartiges Gebilde, eine Art Rolle, versperrt und es hängt dahinter nach innen zu auch noch ein schleierartiger Vorhang. Ich höre Stimmen, die recht munter klingen, und mache mich bemerkbar. Frau Peterli kommt herbei. Sie kann durch den so überaus schmalen Spalt zwischen den Wandschränken hindurch gehen, zieht den Schleier zur Seite, lässt aber die senkrecht im Spalt stehende und irgendwie befestigte Rolle da, etwa wie eine Kette, die man vor eine Tür gelegt hat, wobei man diese doch einen Spalt weit öffnen und den Besucher anschauen und ansprechen kann. Sie schaut mich fragend an und ich hebe an, zu sagen, wozu ich den Strassenbahnausweis brauche. Es ist nur wenig Zeit zur Verfügung und ich habe eigentlich als selbstverständlich vorausgesetzt, dass sie den Ausweis sofort finden werden. Jetzt wird mir aber klar, dass das natürlich garnicht sicher ist. Als ich zum Reden ansetze, erwache ich. (252 words)

Ich hatte gerade eine Operation am rechten Fuss gehabt und bekam jetzt aber Zweifel, ob ich überhaupt auf die frische Narbe eine solche Salbe schmieren durfte. Ich begann deshalb, sie dort weg zu wischen und zu tupfen, denn ich hörte schon den Arzt kommen. Dabei erwachte ich. (66 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2946 (1993-12-19 - Zürich)Ich besuchte Urs Reichlin, um ihm Blätter aus Zeitungen zu bringen, die ich herausgenommen hatte, weil darauf von Demonstrationen die Rede war, was ihn interessierte. Ich traf ihn im Keller des Hauses, in dem er wohnte, wo er sich um die Heizung kümmerte. Als ich hinabstieg und seinen Namen rief, hörte ich seine Stimme nur schwach antworten und fand ihn schliesslich ein Dampfbad nehmend in einem Nebenraum der Heizung, in dem es sehr heiss war. Er steckte seinen Kopf aus dem Dampf heraus und sah recht blass aus. Auf meine Frage. wie es ihm gehe, sagte er: "Schlecht". Er hatte eine Erkältung oder Grippe, zu deren Bekämpfung er das Dampfbad nahm. Ich meinte, er müsse wohl jetzt wieder herausgehen, und er stimmte dem zu. Ich legte ihm die Blätter hin, und erklärte das, und ausserdem ein Buch über Ringe, mit schönen Abbildungen, das ich ebenfalls mitgebracht hatte. Ich sagte, ich werde es später gelegentlich wieder abholen. Er erklärte, dass er es schon einmal gehabt habe, aber es gerne noch einmal anschauen wolle. In dem Traum spielte auch die Architektur des Hauses eine Rolle, ebenso wie in einer vorhergehenden Szene die Architektur der gesamten Strasse, in der sehr schöne alte Häuser waren, zum Teil noch aus lehmgefülltem Fachwerk.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2947 (1993-12-19 - Zürich)Ich hatte erhebliches Nasenbluten. Um es zu bremsen, bekam ich einen kleine Bluttransfusion, denn es bestand die Theorie, dass es dadurch gestoppt werden konnte. Nach einiger Zeit fing es aber wieder an. Ein anderer Arzt sagte nun, dass die Methode nur bei einer grossen Bluttransfusion wirksam wäre. Man überlegte, ob man das bei mir machen sollte, fand aber, dass das doch zu aufwendig sei und man andere Wege suchen sollte, um das Ziel zu erreichen. (75 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2948 (1993-12-20 - Zürich)Eine Russin, die ich liebte. Sie erzählte aus der Vergangenheit und sagte in dem Zusammenhang. "Es war da zwischen uns beiden nichts mehr. Es war mal wieder vorbei." Ich entnahm daraus vor allem, dass aber jetzt gerade wieder etwas war zwischen uns beiden, und vor allem, wie sehr ich ihr überhaupt etwas bedeutete. Sie stellte unsere Beziehung wie einen Geisir dar, der immer wieder neu ausbricht. Die Gestalt in dem Traum war, vom Wachen her gesehen, irgendwie eine Mischung aus Gisela und der Grauen Dame, im Traum selbst aber eine völlig einheitliche Figur, die mir sehr vertraut war, und zu der sich die Beziehung immer neu anbahnte, bziehungsweise auch von ihr immer neu erlebt wurde.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2949 (1993-12-21 - Zürich)Ich war auf Reisen mit der Bahn, stand vorne an der Spitze des Wagens mit meinem Gepäck. Plötzlich war die Station da, an der ich aussteigen musste. Mein Gepäck war noch ziemlich ausgebreitet. So waren zum Beispiel zwei Bären und eine Puppe, die ich bei mir hatte, noch draussen und auch anderes lag über den Koffern ausgebreitet. Ich trug es schnell raus und legte es auf eine Bank vor der Wagentür, die ich im Auge behalten konnte und auf deren anderem Ende ein tief schlafender Mann lag. So rannte ich noch mehrere Male hin und her mit so viele Sachen, wie ich so schnell packen konnte. Plötzlich setzte der Wagen, der schon vom vorderen Teil des Zuges getrennt war, sich rangierend in Bewegung. Ich rannte hinterher und rief. Glücklicher Weise hielt er nach einigen Metern wieder an. Ich sprang hinein, um den Rest zu holen. Leute die vorne standen, halfen mir hinein und ein Mann sagte: "Hinterher werden Sie sich wohler fühlen." Ich antwortete: "Ja, wenn ich es schaffe", kletterte hinein und warf zunächst zwei Paar hohe Schnürstiefel und ein Paar Schuhe hinaus, die noch oben auf den Koffern lagen, und ergriff dann als letztes die zwei Koffer und eine Tasche. Es gelang mir, noch hinaus zu kommen, ehe der Zug wieder abfuhr, und ich erwachte ausser Atem. Draussen tobte ein starker Wintersturm, der schon den ganzen Tag über als warmer Südweststurm geblasen und warme Luft herbeigetrieben hatte. (238 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2952 (1993-12-23 - Zürich)Ich fuhr im Trolleybus und wollte an einer Haltestelle aussteigen, die der Lage nach etwa der am Löwenplatz entsprach, aber doch irgendwie anders aussah. Eine Frau sagte, als ich zur Tür ging, um den Türöffnungsknopf zu drücken, das Wetter sei so mühsam, dass man garnichts richtig fertig bringen könne. Das käme daher, dass die ganze Luft voller PH-Werte sei. Ich sagte, dass ich sofort den Knopf drücken müsse, weil es sonst vielleicht zu spät sei. Mit Mühe führte ich den Arm zum Knopf, weil ich mich so erschöpft fühlte. Ich drückte, aber die Tür ging nicht auf. Ich rief nach vorne zum Fahrer: "Hallo, die Tür geht nicht auf". Er reagierte aber nicht. Darum lief ich nach vorne zu ihm und sagte noch mal: "Hallo, die Tür geht nicht auf". Er guckte aber stur nach vorne und reagierte absichtlich nicht. In diesem Moment merkte ich, dass der Wagen sich langsam in Bewegung gesetzt hatte. Der Fahrer war offenbar absichtlich, während ich redete, abgefahren. Er machte, ohne den Kopf zu drehen, eine freche Bemerkung und ich erwachte wütend und mit Kopfweh. (180 words)

Ich sage: "Aha, sie hatten also das Grünzeug mit den Rädern bei der Garage versteckt" Das Paar war vorher oben bei uns im Institut gewesen und wir hatten uns gefragt, wo sie wohl das Grünzeug gelassen hatten, von dem wir wussten, dass sie es zu irgend einem Zweck gesammelt hatten. Ich erwachte, als ich den oben zitierten Satz gesprochen hatte, in der Badewanne liegend und den Kopf auf dem Wannenrand. (118 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2954 (1993-12-24 - Zürich)Besuch in Afrika. Industrielle Herstellungsverfahren wurden uns gezeigt, so zur Herstellung von Plastiktüten und Plastikharassen. Dabei entstand die Frage, ob es besser wäre, am Rand den Stoff noch etwas einzuschlagen, wodurch er weicher würde, oder den Rand mit einer Naht identisch werden zu lassen, wodurch er fester wurde. Das letztere war für die Herstellung von Harassen besser, das andere für die von Plastiktüten, die sich dann angenehmer greifen lassen würden. Es war mir klar, dass solche Kleinigkeiten in der Konstruktion für den praktischen Gebrauch der Dinge und ihre Güte von grosser Bedeutung sein konnten. Dann am Schluss Einblick in ein gotisches Kirchenschiff. Es kam mir der Gedanke, dass dieses in Afrika wohl nicht aus der Zeit der Gotik selbst stammen konnte, sondern aus der Neugotik stammen musste (127 words)

Alle sagen, was für eine Art von Dingen sie zum Geburtstag kriegen soll, damit nicht alle das selbe schenken. Jetzt war gerade von Kunst die Rede. Ich sage: "Also gemeint sind Kunst-Bücher und -Objekte?" Man antwortet: "Ja". Ich sage: "Da musst Du ein Kreuz machen", wobei gemeint ist, dass sie diese Rubrik ankreuzen muss. Ich merke, dass Tina sich kollossal freut, und mir wird klar, dass sie jetzt denken kann, dass es ein Objekt, ein Gegenstand sei, den sie kriegt, während es in Wirklichkeit ein Buch ist, sage also, "aber nicht Objekt, sondern Buch" und merke dabei, dass ihre grosse Freude etwas gedämpfter wird als vorher. Offenbar hat sie sich vor allem bei der Vorstellung gefreut, ein Kunstobjekt zu kriegen. (162 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2956 (1993-12-26 - Zürich)Ich hatte eine Art Seminar oder ähnliche Lehrveranstaltung, bei der ich mit den Studenten etwas einübte, womit wir eine Stummfilmvorführung begleiten wollten. Sie mussten sich zu einer vom Tonband gespielten Musik wie in einer Choreographie bewegen. Diese Übungen hatten wir auch gefilmt. Ich hatte dabei gesehen, dass ein unruhiges Bewegungsbild herauskam, weil die Leute beim Auftreten die Zehenspitze zuerst aufsetzten und dadurch ein Auf und Ab im Bewegungseindruck entstand. Ich wollte das am Anfang des Stunde korrigieren. In diesem Augenblick kam Gerold Hilty herein, der wohl zuschauen und zuhören wollte, andererseits aber auch die Rolle eines Helfers für mich spielte. Er sagte, dass er noch schnell irgendetwas erledigen wolle. Ich sagte zu ihm: "Nein, ich brauch Dich" und machte mit der Hand eine Bewegung, die ihm das Zeichen gab, neben mich zu kommen, was er auch tat. Ich sagte nun, dass wir ja einen Bewegungsvorgang eingeübt hätten, zu einer Musik vom Tonband, die ihrerseits als Begleitmusik zu einem Stummfilm dienen solle. Hier nun wolle ich ihnen eine bestimmte Bewegung noch einmal vormachen. Ich machte nun die Bewegung des Gehens vor und sagte, sie sollten den Fuss nicht so aufsetzen, wobei ich mit der Fussspitze zuerst auftrat, sondern so, wobei ich die Füsse sozusagen parallel zum Boden durchzog und dabei weniger mit der Fussspitze zuerst den Boden berührte. Hilty schaute sehr interessiert zu und machte mit und sagte: "Interessant, das habe ich zum ersten mal gesehen." Er hatte bei meiner Lehrveranstaltung eine Art assistierende und helfende Funktion, war aber gleichzeitig ein Zuschauer, der aus Interesse hereingekommen war. Als das fertig war, wollte ich mich der Beschäftigung mit einer Musik zuwenden. Es lagen für jeden Noten zu drei verschiedenen Musikstücken nebeneinander auf. Ich musste nun sehr vorsichtig vorgehen, damit niemand, vor allem auch Hilty nicht, merkte, dass ich garnicht Noten lesen kann. Zuerst ging es um ein Stück von Puccini. Corinne, die den Leuten dabei auch irgendwas zeigen musste, nahm aber einen anderen Notenstapel, weil sie mich so verstanden hatte, und las den Namen des Komponisten vor. Er hiess Cendras. Es war wohl ein Barockkomponist. Ich beschloss in diesem Moment, diesem Impuls zu folgen, weil ich auch Puccini garnicht gerne mochte und es mir leichter schien, mit einem anderen Komponisten, die nächste Übung so zu absolvieren, dass es Hilty gefallen würde.

Emme sagte beim Lesen des Traums oder Kontextes: "Hier fehlt ein Stück" und las die Worte vor und nach dem fehlenden Stück vor. Ich sagte, das kann ich aus dem Computer holen, das muss noch drin sein und ging los mit dem Text in der Hand, um das fehlende Stück zu suchen.

In diesem Moment zog jemand anders von der Gegenseite des Regals in einem Nebenraum, in den es auch hineinreichte, an dem selben Text. Ich riss kräftiger daran. Wir rangen gleichsam um den Text, ohne uns zu sehen und erkennen zu können, und ich zog so kräftig, dass ich ihn am Schluss hatte und hinauf bringen konnte. (119 words)

Der Gürtel wurde dabei so eng, dass ich die Vorstellung furchtbar fand, so eingeschnürt zu sein. Es schien ihm aber zu gefallen. Sie duzte ihn im Eifer des Scherzens auch, was er sofort erwiderte.

Dann öffnete sich darunter eine flachen Vertiefung, in der sehr geordnet nebeneinander die Handschuhe der Mitglieder und andere Accessoires für bestimmte Anlässe aufgereiht waren. Auf diese Weise hatten sie sich Stauraum für solche Dinge geschaffen, ohne deshalb den Raum mit Möbeln vollstellen zu müssen. (87 words)

Das Gepäck ist schon verstaut und jeden Moment wird auch Emme einsteigen, die noch irgend etwas auf dem Bahnsteig erledigt. Plötzlich setzt sich der Zug in Bewegung, aber zu früh und in die falsche Richtung nach Norden. Ich rufe entsetzt etwas aus und schaue aus dem Fenster. Ich sehe, dass man die letzten drei Wagen des Zuges, in dem ich schon sass, abgehäng und zum Zug nach Winterthur gemacht hat, in dem ich nun also sitze. Es ist klar, dass es nun nicht mehr möglich ist, rechtzeitig zurück zu kommen und den Zug nach Süden zu erreichen. Dann andere Szene. Ein Mann, der eine Frau ungerecht verfolgt und zu Grunde richten will. Er hängt ihr ein Verbrechen an, das sie garnicht begangen hat, und will sie dafür hinrichten lassen. Dafür muss das Volk noch abstimmen, wozu er ihm, wie es offenbar das Gesetz verlangt, zwei Namen nennt. Das Volk stimmt aber für den anderen Namen. Er beginnt nun eine längere Rede, um die Sache doch noch in seinem Sinne umzubiegen. Der andere Name, den er genannt hat, war wohl nur eine Fiktion. Ich erwache sehr erregt und bedrückt. (202 words)

Ich nahm einen solchen Stapel und sah, wie Akert dies nachdenklich auch gerade tat. Er sah mich aufblickend und sagte: "Alle haben vier genommen". Ich antwortete: "Ja, und alle haben dabei irgendwie ein schlechtes Gewissen." Er antwortete: "Ja, ich auch".

Es gehörte zu einem Kaffeezubehör, das schon Gottfried Keller benutzt hatte, und ich hatte sehen wollen, ob man es so aufstellen könnte, dass man es photographieren könne. Die Kanne war aus China-Blue-Porzellan. Der Herr des Hauses kam hinzu, als ich die ausgelaufene Sahne aufzuwischen suchte.

Es kommen uns Fahrzeuge, Fussgänger und Pferde entgegen. Er betätigt den Lautsprecher vor einer besonders engen Kurve, die von Hauswänden gebildet wird. Ich stelle mich direkt an die Wand, etwas gedeckt von einem Mauervorsprung. Da die Kurve eine Innenkurve ist, sieht man die Entgegenkommenden erst im Moment, wo sie passieren. Die Fussgänger und Autos kommen gut vorbei, die Pferde aber drängen sich eng an die Mauer. In dem Augenblick, wo das erste Pferd direkt vor mir riesengross auftaucht und mich an die Wand zu drücken droht, sage in in den Lautsprecher: "Ich stehe direkt an der Wand. Gehen Sie mit den Pferden etwas im Abstand an der Wand vorbei. Es gelingt den Leuten, die Pferde etwas zum Zur-Seite Gehen zu bewegen, aber nur so wenig, dass die Pferde, die immer noch die Tendenz haben, sich an die Wand zu drücken, nun mich im Vorbeigehen nur noch sanft bedrücken. Das beunruhigt mich jeweils nur in dem Moment, wo sie mit ihren Hinterbeinen bei mir vorbeikommen, weil Pferde ja, wenn sie ausschlagen, mit den Hinterbeinen ausschlagen. Erwachen. (205 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2975 (1994-01-06 - Berlin)"Der arme Wetterstein" sagte ein Kind, ein kleines Mädchen, zu einer tiefblauen gläsernen Marmelkugel, als es sie Emme zurückgab. Ich hatte dem Vater des Kindes erlaubt, es mit unserem Spielzeug spielen zu lassen, unter der Bedingung, dass er ihm die Kugeln nicht geben dürfe, weil ich wusste, dass es sie werfen würde, wobei sie zerbrochen wären, die Eltern aber dem Kinde alles erlauben und nicht aufpassen würden. Der Vater hatte aber nicht aufgepasst. Ich sagte deshalb zu Emme, dass wir die Kugel gleich wieder an uns nehmen sollten. Emme fand das aber wohl schwierig und sagte etwas wie "Das kann man doch nicht machen". Ich antwortete: "Doch das kann man sehr wohl machen, denn es war ja die Bedingung." Ich fand es richtiger, die Kugeln energisch zurück zu nehmen, als zu warten, bis sie kaputt seien, denn sie waren nicht ersetzbar und gehörten eigentlich nicht zu den Marmelkugeln. Das Kind nannte sie Wettersteine, weil sie gewettert, gleich: geworfen, wurden, und weil es Glas und Stein sprachlich noch nicht unterscheiden konnte. Arm aber nannte es sie, weil es doch schon wusste, dass sie zerbrechen würden. Es waren Eltern, die ihrem Kinde grundsätzlich und aus Prinzip nichts verbieten wollten. Wir aber fanden es es auch für das Kind viel besser, klar zu sagen, was man nicht durfte, und so das Kind nicht zum Tyrannen werden zu lassen. (225 words)

Bei näherer Betrachtung dieser Beschreibung merke ich, dass etwas dabei nicht stimmen kann, und komme schliesslich darauf, dass nach dieser Beschreibung einer der Vorfahren, von denen da die Rede ist, sein eigener Vater oder Grossvater gewesen sein müsste. Ich überlege, ob ich mich nun noch melden und das mitteilen solle, komme aber zu dem Schluss, dass es dazu ja zu spät wäre, weil der Kauf schon endgültig gemacht ist, und dass es mir hätte früher auffallen müssen.

Der Regisseur musste bis zum letzten Moment um die Erlaubnis kämpfen, die Bühne zu benutzen, und musste von einer Instanz zur anderen gehen. Als er es schliesslich erreicht hatte, war es schon der Zeitpunkt des Auftretens. Das Stück war einstudiert, aber die Zeit zur Generalprobe abgelaufen. Nichts war vorbereitet, so dachte er, als er bei der Bühne eintraf. Die Aufführung konnte nicht stattfinden. Aber ein anderer, wohl berühmter, Regisseur war vorbei gekommen, hatte die Situation erkannt und mit der Truppe das Stück geprobt, das er garnicht kannte. Er hatte die Truppe einfach spielen lassen und abgewartet und nur sanft eingegriffen, jeweils nachdem er, oder während er die Szene kennen gelernt hatte. So stand die Truppe im Moment des Beginns der Vorstellung und des Eintreffens des Regisseurs fertig auf der Bühne und die Aufführung konnte stattfinden. Der vorbeigekommene Regisseur war beeindruckt von der Güte der Einstudierung, die er sozusagen life bei der Probe mit dem ihm unbekannten Stück kennengelernt hatte. Diese seine Begeisterung war für die Zukunft des eigentlichen Regisseurs von grosser Bedeutung. Ich glaube, er erlaubte im und seiner Truppe, in Zukunft auf seiner Bühne aufzutreten wo noch Aufführungszeiten frei waren. (197 words)

Sie konnten mit ihrem stromlinienförmigen Fahrzeug balancierend auf zwei Rädern fahren und schliesslich sogar in gewagten Kurven sich in Sprüngen in die Luft erheben und wieder auf der Erde landen und weiter fahren. Sie kamen bei allen diesen Kapriolen auch immer heil durch das Betriebstor, obwohl sie seinen Pfosten oft gefährlich nahe kamen. Schliesslich kamen sie uns, die stehend zuschauten - es waren mehrere Menschen - so nahe, dass sie mich einmal im Bremsen am Bein berührten. Ich spürte aber nur einen sanften Stoss und war nicht irgendwie verletzt. Dann fuhren unsere Bekannten, die mit uns zusammengewesen waren und ebenfalls zugeschaut hatten, mit ihrem eigenen Personenauto weg, das ebenfalls stromlinienförmig war. Die Strasse war jetzt vereist. Sie kamen aber ohne Schwierigkeiten fort. Emme und ich gingen jetzt zu Fuss weiter über das Eisfeld, das jetzt sehr unregelmässig und zerklüftet wurde, aber noch die Form einer Strasse hatte, auf der wir offenbar zum Bahnhof gehen mussten, um mit dem Zug abzufahren. Ich hatte einen Gepäcktransportwagen, wie man sie auf Bahnhöfen findet, auf dem ich unsere Koffer schob und der mir auf dem glatten Eis Halt gab. Ich schlug darum Emme vor, sich auch an diesem Wagen zu halten. Sie wollte das aber nicht, weil es aus irgend einem Grund für sie nicht geschickt war. Sie bemerkte nun aber, dass das Eis, über das ich ging, regelmässige kluftartige Einschnitte hatte, in die ich mit den Beinen tief hineingeriet, und sagte, ich müsse am Rand gehen, weil ich sonst in diese Spalten hineinfallen würde. Ich merkte bald, dass das stimmte und ich auf diesem gewellten Eisfeld, das die Strasse bildete, nicht weiter kam. Ich schob den Gepäckwagen deshalb an den Strassenrand, wo Eis und Schnee eben waren und man besser vorwärtskommen konnte, und erwachte allmählich. (305 words)

Sie sagte, dass Hochwälders in der Wohnung gegenüber eingezogen wären und wir redeten zusammen über Fritz Hochwälder. Sie nannte ihren Namen, in dem irgendwie das Wort Strelenau oder Strelitz vorkam. Ich zitierte Nikolaus Lenaus Gedicht " Lieblich war die Maiennacht. Silberwölkchen flogen" und sie war erfreut, zu sehen, dass ich wusste, dass ihr Name derjenige Nikolaus Lenaus war. Ich glaube, sie sagte, er sei einer ihrer Vorfahren. Als wir nach einiger Zeit wiederkamen, war alles Geld weg und andere Dinge in den Wohnungen und die dicke Frau und ihr Mann ebenfalls. Es waren Betrüger, die sich das Vertrauen der Bewohner erschlichen hatten und dann mit allem Geld und Wertsachen verschwunden waren. Emme sagte, dass ich die Frau ja gleich für eine Betrügerin gehalten hätte, während sie das ja nicht geglaubt hätte. Es kamen dann noch andere Traumszenen, die ich vergessen habe (209 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2986 (1994-01-13 - Zürich)Beschäftigung mit Berlin und mit der Frage, wie die Hauseingänge den Bezirken zugeteilt sind, in die die Stadt für bestimmte Versorgungsfragen und Verwaltungsfragen eingeteilt ist. Es zeigte sich, dass diese Einteilung nach Strassen und nicht nach Hauskomplexen getroffen war, sodass ein Haus, das an den Bezirksgrenzen Eingänge von verschiedenen Strassen aus hatte, gleichsam aufgeteilt war. Es konnte sein, dass man für die verschiedenen Bezirke im selben Haus durch das gleiche Treppenhaus gehen musste, weil die Eingänge, die in dieses Treppenhaus führten, zu verschiedenen Bezirken gehörten. Ich war in einem solchen Treppenhaus und sah Leute, die für die Bezirksverwaltungen arbeiteten, durch das Teppenhaus gehen und die Wohnungen suchen, für die sie jeweils zuständig waren. (113 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2987 (1994-01-13 - Zürich)Eine Art Massagesalon in Westberlin, wo auch Leute aus dem Osten massiert wurden. Man konnte Beine einfach ein und aushängen und in ihnen war Gepäck untergebracht. Ich fand das aber eher beunruhigend. Es war ein lebhafter Betrieb in dem Raum. Es war zugleich auch das Innere eines Flugzeuges und durch das Aushängen der Gepäckbeine, die dann durch andere, leichtere ersetzt wurden, konnte man das Gewicht verringern. (66 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2988 (1994-01-14 - Zürich)Ich hatte viele Unterlagen der zu Prüfenden und der schon Geprüften in hohen Räumen eines klassizistisch wirkenden Hauses unterzubringen. Sie waren sorgfältig in gleichen Aktenordnern untergebracht: Lizentiatsgutachten, Prüfungsunterlagen und so weiter. Auch die Lizentiatsarbeiten wurden dort aufgestellt. Ich dachte darüber nach, wie viel Platz sie in den Räumen einnehmen würden und wo ich sie aufstellen sollte, da in den selben Räumen noch andere Dinge von den anderen Familienmitgliedern aufgestellt wurden. Es war eine Art Archiv oder Unterbringungsraum von Sachen für die ganze Familie, wo auch Bücher und anderes hinkam. Emme drängte zum Aufbruch. Ich wollte ihr erklären, was ich erst noch aufstellen müsste, aber sie gab mir Zeichen, dass wir aufbrechen müssten, wohl um irgendwo anders etwas zu erledigen. Das Ganze war in einer Umgebung wie in Berlin mit den alten Häusern mit den hohen Räumen. (136 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2989 (1994-01-14 - Zürich)Emme und ich betrachten eine Photographie, auf der man sie auf einem Tiger reiten sieht. Es ist ein wunderschöner Raum, in dem das stattfindet. Plötzlich wird mir klar, dass es das Wohnzimmer in Schwerin ist und dass das der Grund ist, dass der Raum mir so schön erscheint. Ich sage das zu Emme. An die Szene mit dem Tiger erinnere ich mich. Er war plötzlich in dem Zimmer, in dem wir zusammen waren, und Emme hat sich auf ihn gesetzt, weil er so am wenigsten gefährlich war. Der Tiger hatte sie freundlich und liebevoll getragen. Ich sage: "Wo die Tiger" - es waren zwei - "jetzt wohl sind?". Sie waren damals offenbar irgendwo ausgebrochen oder weggelaufen. Dann ist Tina da und macht Weihnachtsvorbereitungen. Sie sagt: "Ihr müsst nur das machen, was unbedingt nötig ist und ihr nur selber könnt". Alles andere wolle sie machen. Dann sagt sie. "Bei Julia gibt es Quittenbrot" Ich sage: "Habt Ihr sie getroffen?" Tina antwortet "Ja". Ich : "Wo habt ihr sie getroffen? " Tina schweigt. Ich wiederhole die Frage. Sie haben sie offenbar gestern abend irgendwo gesehen, wo sie auch waren. Langsam erwache ich und mir wird klar, dass ja Julia tot ist und vielleicht deswegen Tina den Ort, wo sie sie getroffen haben, verschweigt, oder dass ihr Verschweigen das bedeutet. (217 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2990 (1993-01-14 - Zürich)Wir waren unterwegs mit einer alten aber unternehmungslustigen Tante von Emme, die uns besuchen sollte. Wir überlegten, ob wir in dem Ort, in dem wir waren, in eine Wirtschaft gehen sollten. Die Tante sagte, sie müsse dann aber bald zum Zug, um nach Hause zu fahren. Wir machten ihr klar, dass wir doch zu uns gehen und sie uns besuchen solle, was sie dann auch wollte. Es wurde aber deutlich, dass die Zeit nicht reichen würde, noch in die Wirtschaft zu gehen, weil die Fahrt mit der Strassenbahn und wohl auch noch ein Fussweg zum Bahnhof zu lange dauern würden. Dann Szenenwechsel: Ich hatte den Weg, wohl in umgekehrter Richtung, mit einer jungen Frau zurückgelegt, mit der mich eine freudschaftliche liebevolle Beziehung verband. Wir waren Arm in Arm gegangen. Nun kam ein ganz junges Mädchen, das sich ungeheuer weich und lebhaft und erotisch an mich schmiegte. Sie hatte tiefdunkle, fast schwarze, aber ungeheuer leuchtende Augen. Die Frau riet ihr, sich auf dem Weg von mir begleiten zu lassen. Das wollte sie auch und schmiegte sich weich und elastisch an mich. Ich wachte erfreut auf. (184 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2991 (1994-01-15 - Zürich)Emme und ich kamen von einer Reise zurück. Mussten zunächst mit der Strassenbahn und anderen Verkehrsmitteln einen Weg durch die Stadt suchen, um zu Bille zu kommen, dann noch einen Weg durch Wiesen bergauf gehen, um zu einem Telephon zu kommen, das dort im Freien untergebracht war, um von dort aus Gadamer anzurufen. Ich suchte das Telephon auf einem Tischchen, weil es dort früher gewesen war und ich es oft benutzt hatte. Emme aber wies gleich auf eine Hecke und sagte "Dort ist es doch", weil es seit einiger Zeit modernisiert und in dieser Hecke untergebracht war. Später dann noch andere Szene, wo wir in der Wohnung waren, die wohl auch Billes Wohnung aber zugleich unsere war, und ich zum Briefkasten gehen musste und wollte, der vor der Haustür an der Strasse war.Ich musste mir dazu etwas anziehen und sah mein Nachthemd da liegen, das ich anziehen und einen Mantel darüberziehen wollte, denn ich war in dem Moment noch nackt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2993 (1994-01-17 - Zürich)Ich war in einem Gebäudekomplex ehemaliger Universitätskliniken, und zwar in der alten Augenklinik, in der irgendeine Institution untergebracht war, in der wir zu tun hatten. Ich hatte dort beim Räumen einen Zweig einer Pflanze am Fenster abgebrochen und machte mir Sorgen, was Emme dazu sagen werde. Ich hoffte, sie werde sagen, dass das nicht so schlimm sei und dass die Pflanze schnell neue Zweig hervorbringen werde. In einer anderen Szene, wohl vorher, war es aber auch wirklich noch ein Klinikbereich. Man musste, um in eine bestimmte Klinik, wohl die Augenklinik, zu kommen, geradeaus über einen Hof gehen. Es war nur unzureichend beschriftet, aber ein Arzt im weissen Kittel nahm einen in Empfang, wenn man am richtigen Tor ankam. Hier ging es dann wohl in die Szene über, wo in dem Gebäudekomplex jetzt etwas anderes untergebracht war, eine andere Institution, in der wir etwas zu erledigen hatten. (146 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2994 (1994-01-18 - Zürich)Ich war in Urs Imoberdorfs Wohnung und konnte dort mit meinem Computer arbeiten. Aber ich fand in dem Zimmer nicht den Tisch für den Computer. So verging viel Zeit, bis ich schliesslich doch etwas als Tisch Geeignetes fand. Im Hintergrund hörte ich Imoberdorf und seine Frau reden. Er kam dann herein und ich zeigte ihm einen Plan von Berlin und zeigte auf eine Stelle, an der Berlin-Charlottenburg zu sehen war und sagte, hier würde ich arbeiten, denn ich musste offenbar zur Fortsetzung der Arbeit dort hin ziehen, wo eine Universität war, die damit zu tun hatte. Ich merkte, dass ihn die Vorstellung des endlosen Häusermeers, das auf dem Plan zu sehnen war, beunruhigte, und mich packte dabei selber dieses Gefühl und ich empfand etwas wie Heimweh nach Zürich, wo ich ja noch war. Dann erwachte ich. (136 words)

Man rät ihm, zwischendurch etwas anderes zu studieren, zum Beispiel Geschichte. Er ist sehr enttäuscht. Andere Szene: Es ist eine Sommernacht. Ich habe ein sackartiges modisches Gewand an, friere aber und ziehe mir einen Mantel über. Tina nimmt mir den Mantel weg, weil sie das modisch unmöglich findet. Ich suche nun nach einer Strickjacke oder etwas ähnlichem. Emme findet, ich könne den Mantel ruhig überziehen. Andere Szene: Im Foyer eines Saals. Eine Frau drangsaliert eine junge Logenschliesserin, deren Vorgesetzte sie ist, und führt sie gewaltsam und mit hartem Griff in den Saal, wo es für die Vorstellung dunkel ist. Ich finde, dass man eingreifen muss. Offenbar bin ich der Vorgesetzte der Frau, die hier ihre Untergebene so schlecht behandelt. Ich gehe hinein und finde die beiden. Die Frau hält die Jüngere immer noch in einer Art Polizeigriff. Ich will sie ihr entwinden, merke aber, dass der Griff, mit dem sie ihre Hand hält, eisenhart ist. Ich packe die Hände der Frau, um sie zu öffnen, bin sehr zornig und erwache. (185 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#2996 (1994-01-19 - Zürich)Wir waren zusammen in der U-Bahn in Berlin, Emme und ich, und hatten eine Menge Fahrkarten bei uns, von denen wir nicht wussten, welche jetzt galten. Wir fragten eine Frau an einem Auskunfts- oder Verkaufstisch auf dem Bahnsteig. Sie sagte, wir brauchten noch eine weitere Karte. Wir wunderten uns und wollten das nicht glauben. Sie konnte nicht richtig sagen, welche Karten jetzt gültig waren, und sprach immer wieder zu leise und unverständlich. Ich sagte immer wieder, sie möchte doch lauter sprechen, aber das nützte nicht. Schliesslich redete sie etwas von den Leuten aus dem Süden, das abfällig klang, und schien dabei jemand von der Verwaltung zu zitieren, der etwas über die Leute aus dem Süden, was auch wir waren, gesagt hatte. Vorher waren wir auf verschiedenen Bahnsteigen in verschiedenen Höhendurchschnitten der Station umhergegangen und hatten uns ein Bild von den Linien der durchfahrenden Züge gemacht. Erwachen mit Kopfweh und Nackenschmerzen. (150 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3000 (1994-01-21 - Zürich)Wir waren in einem Saal, in dem eine Art Vorführung oder eine Erklärung von etwas stattfand. Dafür war eine junge Frau auf der Bühne, die bei ihrer Erklärung eines Sachverhaltes das Wort Gurilla gebrauchte, das wohl die englische Aussprache von Gorilla darstellte. Ein Mann im Saal fragte, wie er das Wort schreiben sollte. Sie antwortete: "Das sag ich gleich", führte aber erst noch umständlich etwas anderes zu Ende, obwohl sie doch das Wort ganz leicht hätte buchstabieren können. Als sie aber soweit war, diese Erklärung zu beginnen, fing sie nun an, weitgehend auf englisch, bestimmte Yogaübungen zu beschreiben, was offenbar die Erklärung des Wortes sein sollte. Dabei beugte sie auch im Stehen die Knie seitwärts, was wohl zu der Yogaübung gehörte. Ihre Beine sahen dabei gegen das Licht so dünn aus wie Knochen. Es schien, dass sie an den Beinen wirklich ein Gerippe war. Andererseits überlegte ich mir, ob sie vielleicht doch nur ganz dünne Beine und enge Hosen darüber hätte. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwachte ich. (166 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3001 (1994-01-22 - Zürich)Wir sassen an der Rückfront eines Autos auf zwei Stühlen auf der Strasse, so, als ob das Auto, ein Mercedes, mit seiner Kofferraumhaube unser Tisch wäre. Wir hatten da irgendetwas zu erledigen. Von hinten kam ein anderes Auto, das hinter uns parken wollte. Der Fahrer fuhr es langsam ganz dicht an uns heran, sodass sein Spiegelbild im Rückfenster des Autos immer grösser wurde. Ich sagte dem Fahrer, er müsse doch nicht so dicht an uns heranfahren. Es war nämlich überall Platz und die Strasse ganz leer. Er setzte daraufhin das Auto ein ganz klein wenig zurück, sodass es aber immer noch unmittelbar hinter uns stand, und ging weg. Nach einer Weile setzte sich das Auto von selbst in Bewegung, rollte vor und stiess mich sanft in den Rücken. Ich schob es wieder so weit zurück, dass es stand wie vorher. Nach einigen Momenten merkte ich, dass es sich nun in der anderen Richtung in Bewegung gesetzt hatte und allmählich immer schneller fortrollte, weil es dort bergab geht. Ich hätte es laufend nicht mehr einholen können, weil es nun immer schneller wurde. Es fuhr gefährlich nahe an einigen anderen weiter unten geparkten Autos vorbei. Ich sagte: "Was soll man bloss tun?" Emme oder mein Begleiter sagte, man müsse vielleicht mit einem Auto hinterher fahren. Es war aber keines da. Beim Weiterrollen geriet das Fahrzeug in eine Kurve und verschwand in einer Seitenstrasse, wo es offenbar zum Stehen kam. Ich lief hin und fand schon eine Menschenmenge um das Auto stehen, das wohl in einem Busch oder an einem Zaun gelandet war. Die Leute sagten, man müsse es zurückschieben. Ich sagte wo es gestanden habe, und beteiligte mich am Zurückschieben. Ich fragte, ob es beschädigt sei. ein Mann sagte: "Einen Kratzer hat es schon bekommen". Nun sah ich, dass seine Kühlerhaube ziemlich zerknittert und etwas angehoben war. Es war ein ziemlich alter Volkswagen in der Käferform. Der Mann sagte, einen Blick auf das Auto werfend: "Es ist ein Excus", was offenbar eine Typenbezeichnung war. Es wurde mir klar, dass das Auto, nachdem ich es von meinem Rücken zurückgeschoben hatte, langsam in die Richtung meines Schiebens weitergelaufen sein musste. Ich überlegte nun, was ich der Polizei sagen sollte, falls sie kommen und fragen sollte. Bei diesen Überlegungen, die mir Sorgen machten, erwachte ich langsam mit starken Kopf- und Nackenschmerzen, die von der Nackenwirbelsäule ausgingen. (391 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3002 (1994-01-23 - Zürich)Sass mit Gisela und anderen in einem Flugzeug über Zürich, wo wir landen wollten. Wir flogen schon dicht über der Stadt, die aber nicht zu sehen war, weil es neblig war. Eine Frau zeigte mir in einem Nebenraum ein Radarbild, auf dem man die ganze Stadt direkt unter uns mit allen Häusern und Strassen gut erkennen konnte. Gisela hatte ein altes Kouvert mit einer Anschrift in der Stadt, die sie mit blauer Tinte in ihrem typischen lebendigen Rhythmus geschrieben hatte. Dass das Kouvert alt war, sah man daran, dass bei den Briefmarken auch die kleine blaue Notopfer-Berlin-Marke war. Als ich den lebhaften lebendigen Rhythmus der Schrift sah, bekam ich ein Gefühl von Heimweh nach jener Zeit, in der sie es geschrieben hatte. Zürich war dabei zugleich wie Freiburg, die Stadt, in der wir damals waren. (135 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3003 (1994-01-24 - Zürich)Ich war in einer Art Kurs oder Vereinigung, wo aus einem Goldgewebe durch Falten oder Rollen oder ähnliches eine Art Ring gemacht werden sollte. Das war ein ziemlich hoffnungsloses Unterfangen, denn es ergab sich ein ziemliches Gewurstel, dessen unversorgte Ränder Fäden hängen liessen. Ich fand, dass man das ganze anders falten müsse, als es schon geschehen war, und nahm es zu diesem Zweck mit nach Hause. Zuerst musste man das Gebilde wieder entwirren, um es dann neu falten zu können. Es wurde aber nicht besser. Ich brauchte Emmes Hilfe, um es straff zeihen zu können. Als es schon fast wieder zu einem schlauchartigen Gebilde gefaltet war, liess sie es los, weil sie es wieder zu wurstelig fand. Ich sagte, ich müsse es unbedingt irgendwie wieder zu einem Ring falten, weil ich es wieder loswerden und dann nichts mehr damit zu tun haben wollte. So fing ich noch mal an und sagte, sie dürfe es auf keinen Fall wieder loslassen, ehe es zusammengefügt sei. Dann erwachte ich unglücklich und beunruhigt davon und mit Kopfweh. Erst allmählich wurde mir klar, dass es ja nur ein Traum sei, und ich es überhaupt nicht weiter machen müsse. (193 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3004 (1994-01-24 - Zürich)Traum von zwei verschiedenen Dialogen, die gleichzeitig geführt wurden, der eine mit der Aussenwelt, der andere mit dem Inneren oder mit dem Unbewussten. Dafür hatte man zwei verschiedene Cordhosen übereinander an, die beide mit Computern verbunden waren. Die äussere für den Dialog mit der Aussenwelt war etwas grösser, die untere etwas kleinere war für den Dialog mit dem Unbewussten. Zu jedem Computer hatte man eine eigene Tastatur, in die man seine Gedanken tippte. Beide funktionierten etwas verschieden, was eine Umstellung beim Wechsel von der einen zur anderen Tastatur erforderte. Die für den Dialog mit der Aussenwelt bestimmte war die modernere und sah irgendwie stromlinienförmig aus. Gleichzeitig sollte auch die dazugehörende äussere Hose ein zweitesmal geschneidert werden, und ich machte während des Schreibens dafür eine Art Massnehmen, indem ich bestimmte Punkte des Kleidungsstückes anzeichnete. Mir kam dann aber die Idee, dass man dem Schneider einfach das Kleidungsstück geben und sagen konnte, er solle es kopieren. Nach dem Erwachen brauchte ich eine Weile, bis ich begriff, dass das ein Traum gewesen war, den man aufschreiben könne. (174 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3005 (1994-01-25 - Zürich)Irgendwo in der Universität oder in der Bibliothek war ein behinderter Mann beschäftigt, der nur etwas lallend sprechen konnte. Ich hörte ihn hinter mir kommen und hielt die Tür offen, als ich, ein paar Stufen hochgehend, aus der alten schweren Haustür des Gebäudes ging. Er gesellte sich zu mir und ging neben mir und ich sagte, den Blick nach vorne auf die Strasse gerichtet, irgendetwas. Aus der Art seines Antwortens merkte ich, dass es nicht er war, und sah, nach links zur Seite blickend, dass es ein junger Student war, der nun zu sehr ausschweifenden Reden voller Klischees über Umweltschutz und anderes ansetzte. Ich überlegte, ob ich ihn abschütteln konnte, merkte aber, dass das nicht gut ging, ohne sehr unhöflich zu wirken. Wir waren nun auf einer breiten, wenig gegliederten Strasse mit einer Art Kopfsteinpflaster, auf der lebhafter Autoverkehr von beiden Seiten war und zugleich eine entgegenkommende Strassenbahn. Um dieser auszuweichen musste man praktisch in der Mitte der Strasse gehen und gleichzeitig den von vorne und hinten schnell herankommenden Autos ausweichen, deren Weg auf der sehr breiten Strasse man schwer abschätzen konnte. Ich merkte, dass der junge Mann sehr verunsichert war in dieser Situation, und führte ihn deshalb an den Schultern. Schliesslich wurde mir klar, dass wir durch die Autoströme hindurch die ganze breite Strasse überqueren mussten, um auf der anderen Seite in Sicherheit zu sein, weil auf unserer Seite sich immer schneller die ziemlich altmodisch wirkende Strassenbahn näherte, deren Schienen man zwischen dem Kopfsteinpflaster sah. Uns entgegenkommend sah ich die sehr klein gewachsene lebhafte Frau Hofmann vom Flohmarkt herankommen, die im Vorbeigehen freundlich und temperamentvoll grüsste, wie es ihre Art ist, und sagte, dass sie nicht verweilen könne, weil sie es sehr eilig habe. Ich überlegte, ob es denn Samstag sei und wir vielleicht den Flohmarkt versäumt hätten. Dann erwachte ich und brauchte einige Zeit, bis mir klar wurde, dass jetzt ja Winter und deshalb kein Flohmarkt ist. (319 words)

Vorher hatten wir zu dritt im Bett gelegen, und, als Emme hinausging, hatte das Mädchen mich umarmt und ich hatte sie zurück umarmt, sodass wir eine Weile fest umschlungen da lagen, während das Mädchen etwas erzählte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3010 (1994-01-28 - Zürich)Wir wohnten in einem Haus, in dessen Mitte ein grosser Saal war, in dem auch Veranstaltungen durchgeführt wurden oder Vorlesungen. Einmal hatte jemand leuchtend blaue Farbe in dem Saal ausgegossen, die an verschiedenen Stellen grosse Pfützen auf dem Fussboden gebildet hatte. Später stellte sich heraus, dass man die Farbe entfernen konnte. Ein andermal schlief ich in dem Saal und jemand hatte von aussen die Sicherheitsschlösser der Türen verschlossen, sodass ich nicht herauskonnte. Später stellte sich heraus, dass es die Ehefrau eines Nachbarn war, die es aus Schabernack getan hatte. Als ich in dem verschlossenen Saal war, blies jemand mit irgendeinem Mechanismus Staub und Dreck durch die Schlüssellöcher in den Saal. Ich schoss mit einer Wasserpistole, die ich im Saal fand, durch das Schlüsselloch zurück und merkte, dass die Person von dem Wasserstrahl getroffen wurde. In einer anderen Szene lag ich in der Badewanne. Als ich schon das Wasser abgelassen hatte, kam jemand hinzu und ich fragte ihn, ob er auch mit in die Badewanne wollte und liess das Wasser wieder hinein. In einer wieder anderen Szene hatte der Saal grosse Schiebetüren, die man wie Garagentore nach oben schieben konnte, um sie zu öffnen, Es waren jeweils zwei Flügel übereinander, die wie Wandtafeln auf und ab glitten und dabei wie die englischen Schiebefenster mit einander gekoppelt waren und miteinander reagierten. Durch eine Umdrehung des Schlüssels im Sicherheitsschloss konnte man sie so entkoppeln, dass unten am Boden eine Öffnung entstand, durch die ich, als ich das getan hatte, an den Beinen frische Luft hereinströmen fühlte. Ich konnte aber hinterher die beiden Türen nicht wieder richtig verkoppeln, sodass man sie nun nicht mehr verschliessen konnte. Ich sagte das einem Hauswart, der gerade da war, damit er sie wieder richtig zusammenschliessen könne. Schliesslich erwachte ich von einem gewaltigen Donnerschlag, mit dem draussen ein Sturmgewitter begann. (301 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3011 (1994-01-29 - Zürich)Jemand - in Teilen des Traums ist es eine junge Frau, in anderen ein junger Mann - wartet darauf, dass ihm eine Nachricht überbracht wird, die letztlich die Übernahme einer hohen, wohl teils religiösen, teils weltlichen, Funktion oder Rolle mitteilt. Er weiss das aber nicht so genau und ist sehr wankelmütig und ungläubig. Ich gehöre dem Gremium an, das das entscheidet, bin aber gleichzeitig auch irgendwie der Bote oder Teilnehmende, der ihm den Gang der Dinge mitteilt, oder sagt, dass er noch warten soll. Dazu steige ich herab in den Keller oder ein Erdgeschoss, wo er wartet. Die Funktion ist irgendwie eine religiöse Rolle, etwas wie eine Art religiöses Königtum, beziehungsweise in den Passagen, wo es eine Frau ist, auch eine Art manaartige Rolle,wie die einer Gottheit. Da ist auch die Frage, ob das durch ein Symbol ausgedrückt werden soll, das in diesem Fall ein Schuh ist, der etwas Heiliges darstellt. Zuletzt ist das Gremium kurz vor der Entscheidung, ihm diese hohe Rolle zuzusprechen und der Empfänger der Nachricht, jetzt ist es wieder ein Mann, gerade in diesem Moment sehr kleinmütig. Eine junge Frau, die ich als Studentin kenne, ruft mir im Vorbeigehen zu, dass sie ihm wegen ihrer braunen Hautfarbe diese Nachricht überbringen wolle. In dieser Phase des Traums ist der Mann auch von brauner Hautfarbe. Mir ist deutlich, dass ich ihr klar machen muss, dass die Nachricht, wenn sie positiv ist, von Mitgliedern des Gremiums überbracht werden muss, weil es dann gleichsam ein Rechtsakt, eine Ernennung ist. Mir ist auch klar, dass es nicht gut ist, wenn sie die Nachricht vorher gleichsam als Gerücht überbringt, da ich in Erinnerung habe, dass sie sich nicht klar sondern schwärmerisch ausdrückt. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwache ich und habe zunächst das Gefühl, dass man diesen Traum nicht aufschreiben kann, weil alles zu kompliziert und hintergründig ist. (304 words)

Es war hübsch, aber wir hatten sehr wenig Stauraum und deshalb Schwierigkeiten, unsere Sachen unterzubringen. Emme hatte im Fussboden eine Art zylinderförmigen Schacht entdeckt, der mit einem Dolendeckel abgedeckt war. In diesen nach oben kreisförmig offenen Schacht hatte sie alle Schuhe hineingetan, die gerade nicht getragen wurden, die wir aber doch aufheben wollten. Der Schacht reichte etwa einen Meter in die Tiefe. Ich überlegt, ob man die Schuhe wirklich noch brauchen werde, kam aber zu dem Schluss, dass das gut der Fall sein könne, weil man oft Schuhe gleichsam wiederentdeckt. (101 words)

Andere haben sich durch diese Gänge über lange Strecken bewegt und schliesslich auch in die Stadt zurückgefunden, wobei sie sich völlig im Finsteren orientieren und durch beengend schmale Gänge kriechen mussten. Ich will es auch versuchen, merke aber, dass es zu mühsam wird und ich es nicht werde durchhalten können sodass ich umkehre und in die Stadt zurückgehe.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3015 (1994-01-31 - Zürich)Eine Wohnung mit grossen hohen Zimmern. Ein kleines Kind war da. In einem Raum sollte es nicht spielen, weil da zerbrechliche, wertvolle Sachen waren. Die Tür direkt neben dem Tisch auf dem sie standen, sollte deshalb verschlossen sein. Eine Frau hatte wohl versäumt, die Tür zu verschliessen und das Kind kam hinein. Die Frau zog es schnell nach draussen auf den Flur zurück. In diesem Moment schlug die Tür, wohl vom Wind, zu und die Hand der Frau wurde eingeklemmt. Ich sah am Türrahmen Blut sich ausbreiten und wollte zur Hilfe eilen, um die Hand der Frau zu befreien. Die Frau stand draussen im Flur und es wurde mir klar, dass sie selbst sich wahrscheinlich nicht befreien könne, weil die eine Hand ja unbeweglich war. Ich war drinnen im Raum. In diesem Moment kam Emme, noch ehe ich die Tür erreicht hatte, aussen hinzu, öffnete die Tür und befreite die Frau. Ich hörte sie sagen, dass man die Frau zum Arzt bringen müsse. Ich erwachte sehr beunruhigt und zögerte, den Traum aufzuschreiben. (172 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3016 (1994-02-01 - Zürich)Ich hatte ein Schmalspurfilmband in der Hand, das ein ganzes Stück von der Rolle abgespult war, die selbst irgendwo hinter einem Vorhang verborgen war. Ich wollte das Filmband zurückspulen und dachte, dass es gut sei, wenn an der Achse der Rolle irgend ein Antrieb wäre, der sie zurückdrehen würde, wusste aber, dass die Rolle nicht auf dem Apparat war, also keinen Antrieb hatte. Als ich aber das Filmband, das über verschiedene Gegenstände gespannt war, mit den Händen anzog, begann es, von selbst mir durch die Finger zu laufen, als wenn es aufgespult würde. Dieser Vorgang setzte sich solange fort, bis es ganz hinter dem Vorhang verschwunden war. Ich bückte mich nun und hob den Vorhang hoch, um den Mechanismus zu sehen, der die Rolle aufgerollt hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3018 (1994-02-03 - Zürich)In einem Hörsaal ist ein Restaurant eingerichtet, in dem strenge Sitten herrschen. Man darf sich nicht selber nehmen, sondern der Kellner serviert. Dabei hat er aber eine Hand in der Tasche und einen Tennisschläger unter dem Arm eingeklemmt. Ich habe Grünkohl und Rosenkohl bestellt. Er bringt aber nur Grünkohl. Dann geht er zur Theke, und ich denke, dass er nun den Rosenekohl holt. Er zündet sich aber stattdessen mit zittriger Hand eine Zigarette an und lehnt sich an die Theke. Tina, die neben mir sitzt, ist konsterniert von seinem Verhalten, während ich noch in Gedanken es zu entschuldigen suche und dann denke, dass man sich halt in die Situation fügen muss. Tina aber hält das nicht lange aus, sondern ruft den Leuten an der Theke etwas zu, was aber niemand hört. (131 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3022 (1994-02-05 - Zürich)Traum von einem Hund, der sehr erstaunlich aussah. Er hatte einen Kopf wie ein chinesischer Drache und ein langhaariges weisses Fell, das oben eine grosse weisse Fläche bildete, an der sich ein Rand wie ein Geländer befand, sodass er aussah, wie ein Schiff, etwa wie ein Flugzeugträger, weil die Haare des Fells sich immer wieder so flach legten, dass sie eine völlig glatte Fläche bildeten. Dann schüttelte er sich, und die Haare des Fells standen alle aufrecht, sodass er ganz anders aussah. Dann legten sie sich allmählich wieder und die weisse, glatte Fläche stellt sich wieder her. Zuerst wurde er durch den Raum getragen, in dem wir sassen, eine Wirtschaft, und ich überlegte sogar, ob ich nach Südamerika fliegen sollte, wo er zu Hause war, um ihn genauer zu sehen. Dann aber kam er auf seinen kurzen Beinen in den Raum gelaufen und benahm sich genau wie die meisten Hunde, indem er bettelnd an den Tisch kam. Einige Frauen fürchteten sich vor ihm und fanden ihn unheimlich. Ich merkte aber, dass es ein sehr zahmer und sanfter Hund war. Ich sagte: Er sieht aus wie ein Flugzeugträger, als seine Haare gerade wieder die grosse flache Fläche auf seinem Rücken bildeten, und dann schüttelte er sich wieder und wandelte sich dadurch.

Sie wurde von beflissenen Männern in den Hotels oder schlossartigen Gebäuden eingesammelt, in denen wir wohnten. Ich hatte lauter neue weisse Hemden und andere Wäschestücke, die alle nicht gezeichnet waren. Ich machte mir deshalb Sorgen, ob sie auch richtig zu uns zurück kommen würden, denn der Mann, der sehr hilfsbereit war, wollte sie mit herunter in ganz andere Regionen des Hauses nehmen. Ich kannte die neuen Wäschestücke noch so wenig, dass ich nicht sicher war, ob ich sie überhaupt wiedererkennen würde. Emme meinte aber, dass das kein Problem sein und alles richtig funktionieren würde. Ich dachte noch im Erwachen weiter darüber nach und merkrte erst ganz allmählich, dass es ja ein Traum gewesen war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3024 (1994-02-06 - Zürich)Ich pflanzte mit dem Computer einen Baum im Computertext. Ich tat das, indem ich mit der "Maus" das Symbol des Baumes, das sehr klein war, sozusagen seinen Samen darstellend, in das Symbol des Textdokumentes plazierte. Ich tat es ziemlich an den Rand des rechteckigen Textsymbols auf dem Bildschirm, überlegte mir dann aber, das dort vielleicht nicht genügend Platz für seine Wurzeln sein würde, und dass er vielleicht dann andere Textstellen unkenntlich machen würde. Ich beschloss deshalb, das Symbol des Baumes noch etwas zu verschieben. In diesem Moment war aber der Text voll und wurde ganz schnell zurückgespult, so wie Videokassetten auf dem Videorecorder sich automatisch zurückspulen, wenn sie voll sind. Ich musste nun warten, bis dieser Prozess zu Ende war, da ich während seines Ablaufes nicht eingreifen konnte. Dann wollte ich den Text wieder vorwärts spulen bis kurz vor dem Ende an die Stelle, wo ich den Baum gepflanzt hatte, und das Symbol etwas mehr in die Mitte der Textfläche verschieben. Dann wachte ich auf. (165 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3026 (1994-02-07 - Zürich)Ich war auf Reisen und hatte ein Zimmer mit Bad genommen. Das Bad schien durch eine Umwandlung des Bettes in eine Badewanne zu entstehen. Im Bett lag eine wasserdichte Auflage, die man ausbreiten konnte. Es war aber klar, dass das Wasser, das man darauf einlassen würde, ja an der Seite herunterfliessen würde. Ich sprach noch mit dem Mann, der vor mir in dem Zimmer gewohnt hatte und noch da war, aber auch keinen Rat wusste. Dann fragte ich noch einen fremdsprachigen Hoteldiener, der wohl Nachtdienst hatte, aber auch nicht recht Bescheid wusste. So beschloss ich frustriert, ohne Bad ins Bett zu gehen. Später entdeckte ich, oder entdeckte Emme, dass an der Wand über dem Bett ein Gebilde war, dass man herunter- und auseinanderklappen konnte, und das dann eine Badewanne wurde. Der Diener hatte das nicht gewusst. Ich klappte es auf, doch nun fehlte die Stirnseite der Wanne, sodass das Wasser wieder herausgeflossen wäre. Ich erinnerte mich, ein passendes Teil am Abend irgendwo im Zimmer zusammen mit Bettzeug gesehen zu haben, begann es zu suchen und erwachte langsam. (177 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3027 (1994-02-07 - Zürich)Wir waren auf Reisen und es war Krieg. Tina und ich schliefen oben in einem Haus in einem Zimmer, in einem Nebenzimmer Martina, die wie ein Kind bei uns war, und unten im Haus Emme. Wir, Emme und ich hatten ausgemacht, dass wir, wenn Beschuss käme, uns anziehen und unten im Haus zusammenkommen wollten. Ich wachte auf vom heulenden und krachenden Geräusch einer Granate, stand schlaftrunken auf, sagte zu Tina, dass sie sich doch anziehen sollte, und ging ins Nebenzimmer zu Martina, die noch schlief und offenbar nicht aufgewacht war oder nur halb. Ich sagte, dass wir ausgemacht hätten, uns anzuziehen und runterzugehen, wenn es schösse. Ich überlegte nun, dass wir unten im Wohnzimmer kein Licht machen sollten, damit nicht gezielt auf uns geschossen würde, und dass wir vielleicht ein weisses Tuch haben sollten, um dieses zu zeigen, wenn Soldaten in das Haus eindringen würden, damit sie uns nicht für ihnen feindliche Truppen halten würden. Im Erwachen wurde mir klar, dass wir mitten ins Kriegsgebiet geraten waren und die Front gleichsam an uns vorbeizog, nachdem wir so lange im Frieden gelebt hatten. (182 words)

Er dirigierte und sie hatte auch eine wesentliche Funktion. Ich weiss nicht mehr genau, welche, ob sie ein Soloinstrument spielte, oder auch dirigierte. Beide aber waren überzeugt, etwas falsch gemacht zu haben und dass es ganz schlecht gklungen habe. Jeder suchte die Schuld bei sich selbst und sie entzweiten sich dabei. Ich hörte zu, es war in einer grösseren Gesellschaft. Im Weggehen aber sprach ich beide an und sagte: Es war wunderschön und hat besonders gut geklungen. Beide erstarrten wie zu Salzsäulen und brachten mit ihrem Gesicht zum Ausdruck, dass sie es besser wussten und dass es ganz schlecht gewesen war. Ich sagte: "Ich bin zwar kein Fachmann und garnicht gelehrt, aber ich habe Ohren und habe gehört". Mir war klar, dass beide nur persönliche Probleme in die Sache hinein projizierten und dass diese mit ihrer gegenseitigen Beziehung zu tun hatten. Ich ärgerte mich aber, dass sie mit ihren steinernen Minen zum Ausdruck brachten, dass sie es besser wussten und dass ich eben einfach ihre Fehler nicht gehört hätte. (186 words)

Als ich einmal, sehr in das Darzustellende vertieft, das eigentlich auf meinen persönlichen Lebenserfahrungen beruhte, ganz vergessen hatte, dass dieser Mann als Zuhörer da war, und mein Blick ihn traf, bemerkte ich, dass er sehr interessiert und positiv gestimmt zuhörte.

Später in einer anderen Traumszene war es wieder ein normales Kind, aber auch besonders schwer beim Aufheben, und es fiel mir auf, dass es schon älter aussah.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3035 (1994-02-12 - Zürich)Auf dem Flohmarkt gab es einen Stand, wo verschiedene Sorten Käse verkauft wurden, die frei zugeschnitten und abgewogen wurden. Ich stand nun am nächsten Morgen auf dem Gelände des jetzt geschlossenen Flohmarktes, wo der Verkaufswagen, jetzt abgeschlossen, noch stand. Ein Mann von der Gewerbepolizei inspizierte die Gegend und sah eine Verkaufsquittung dort am Boden liegen, die er aufhob und studierte. Er sagte, sie betrachtend, dass an dem Stand der Käse zu einem verbilligten Preis verkauft worden war, was nur ausserhalb der Ladenöffnungszeiten erlaubt war. Er sprach laut vor sich hin und sagte: "Da muss ich also einschreiten, denn ich kann ja nicht wissen, ob das ausserhalb der Ladenöffnungszeiten war, es sei denn, Herr von Uslar hat wieder danebengestanden und kann es bezeugen". Da ich tatsächlich dagewesen war und die Zeit ausserhalb der Ladengeschäftszeiten gewesen war, sagte ich: "O ja, das kann ich tatsächlich bezeugen", und der Mann von der Gewerbepolizei war befriedigt, dass er nichts unternehmen musste. Er kannte mich von früheren Treffen her und ich hatte schon einmal eine in ähnlicher Art entlastende Auskunft geben können, weil ich auch damals tatsächlich zufällig gerade daneben gestanden hatte, als der Verkauf von irgendetwas, um das es sich handelte, getätigt worden war. Die Leute von dem Käsestand waren immer auf dem Flohmarkt und deshalb kannte ich sie. Der Stand war dort als eine Art Erfrischungsstand wie der Kiosk, wo man Sachen zum Essen kaufen kann.

Dazu brauchte ich Information aus einem Zettelkastensystem. Dazu fehlte mir aber der Schlüssel. Jemand, der mir schon vorher geholfen hatte, weil ich alle Sachen auf Reisen verloren hatte, gab mir seinen Schlüssel. Nun fehlte mir aber auch noch Geld, denn man musste offenbar die Informationen dort kaufen. Er gab mir auch dies. Ich wachte dann auf und wollte den Traum aufschreiben, schlief aber gleich wieder ein. Das wiederholte sich mehrmals und zog sich über lange Zeit hin. Schliesslich schrieb ich aber doch den ganzen verwicklten Traum im Computer auf. Als ich damit fertig war und ein befriedigtes Gefühl darüber hatte, wachte ich erneut auf. Ich hatte auch dieses langwierige Aufschreiben des Traums im Computer nur geträumt. (128 words)

Beim Rausgehen hatten sie sich mit gestohlenen Sachen von uns vollgestopft, Ringen an den Fingern und Schmuckstücken, in den Kleidern versteckt. Ich durchsuchte sie nacheinander und nahm ihnen alles wieder ab und beschimpfte sie, dass sie unsere Gastfreundschaft so missbraucht hatten. Ich machte mir aber auch Sorgen, dass sie wiederkommen könnten, wenn wir nicht da waren und einbrechen. Ich beschloss deshalb, die Wohnung immer gut zu verschliessen. (99 words)

Das zog sich über längere Zeit hin und endete schliesslich ganz im Vertragen. Dieses endgültige Vertragen entstand dadurch, dass wir beide gleichzeitig die Phantasie hatten, dass wir in hohem Alter sehr friedlich vereint miteinander lebten. Als wir das merkten, mussten wir beide lachen und das Eis war gebrochen. Andere Szene: Tina hatte Kummer und musste getröstet werden. Ich kam auf die Idee, sie mit der Frau des Bäckers sprechen zu lassen, von der ich wusste, dass sie sehr beruhigend und verständnisvoll war und eine gleichsam heilende Wirkung hatte. So arrangierte ich ein solches Treffen, von dessen Zweck die Frau des Bäckers nichts wusste. Ich vertraute aber auf ihre natürliche Fähigkeit, zu helfen, und auch Tina tat das. So ging ich aus dem Raum, als die Frau kam, und war sicher, dass es Erfolg haben würde. (146 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3041 (1994-02-16, 03:30 - Zürich)Ich nahm an einem Artt Wettkampf teil, wo man verschiedene Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben möglichst schnell ausführen musste. So musste man zum Beispiel einen Stapel sehr dünner etwa Schreibmaschinenblatt grosser Blättchen auseinander nehmen und neu stapeln. Im Anfang konnte ich das sehr schnell, weil ich ein Prinzip herausbekommen hatte, mit dem man das rationalisieren und in sehr fliessenden Bewegungen machen konnte. Am Schluss, als ich das selbe noch mal machen musste, ging es dagegen nur langsam, zum Teil, weil die Blätter jetzt feucht waren und aneinander klebten, zum Teil aber auch, weil ich wohl ermüdet war. Die Blätter waren wie aus einer organischen Substanz, wie trockenes Laub oder auch wie Gelatine-Blätter, die trocken leicht bewegbar sind, feucht aber aneinander kleben. Ich wusste auch, dass ich bei solchen Wettkämpfen im Ganzen nicht gute Ergebnisse erzielen könnte, weil ich manuell nicht geschickt bin. Nur wenn ich ein Prinzip für den Vorgang herausfinden kann, kann es unter Umständen sehr schnell gehen. Die Szene ging dann irgendwie in eine andere über, in der die grosse Menschenmenge, die dort versammelt war, auf eine Untersuchung oder Behandlung durch eine Ärztin wartete. Ich stand manchmal günstig in der Schlange, dann aber auch wieder, als diese sich plötzlich bewegte, an deren Ende. Ich konnte aber das Prinzip, nach dem sie sich bewegte, nicht erkennen.

Diese Worte standen in kaum noch lesbarer Schrift auf einer Metallplatte eingeprägt am Eingang der Universität. auf dem Boden. Ich hatte sie noch nie gesehen, obwohl ich so oft dort vorbeigegangen war. Sie waren in jugendstil-artiger Schrift aus der Zeit des Erbauung des Gebäudes geschrieben und unter der Platte sah man tatsächlich noch die Räder und Bürsten und Stangen des Automaten, mit dem man am Eingang automatisch die Schuhe putzen sollte, der aber natürlich längst nicht mehr funktionierte. Ich hatte gerade die Buchstaben entdeckt und begonnen sie zu entziffern, als ein Student vorbeikam, der sie nun auch sah und mit entzifferte. So war er es, der zuerst den etwas kleiner geschriebenen Vers "Ich kenne meine Rädlein und schlafen tut man bei Euch ja nicht" entdeckte und munter vorlas. Ich war schon vorher gerührt gewesen bei dem Gedanken, wie oft ich hier vorbeigegangen war und was ich alles hier erlebt hatte. Der Eingang sah aber etwas anders aus als die wirklichen Eingänge zur Universität, aber typisch im Stil des Gebäudes. (187 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3045 (1994-02-18, 03:45 - Zürich)Eine haushohe Flamme stieg am Horizont auf. Es brannte lichterloh. Ich sah das Feuer aus dem Fenster blickend am nächtlichen Himmel. Es stieg an einem bewaldeten Berg auf. Eine Radiostimme berichtete: Eine technische Anlage oder ein Fahrzeug war in Brand geraten und andere in der Nachbarschaft wohl ebenfalls. Der Sprecher sagte, es käme alles darauf an, jetzt richtig zu löschen, das heisst, nicht zu schnell, damit nichts explodiere. Offenbar war auch ein Atomwerk in der Nähe, das nicht Feuer fangen durfte. Allmählich wurde die Stichflamme niedriger und der Himmel langsam heller, weil es Morgen wurde. Ich hörte hinter mir schon Geräusche im Haus und in der Wohnung und überlegte, ob es schon Zeit sei aufzustehen. Offenbar musste ich am Morgen irgendwo hin. Die Radiostimme kommentierte weiterhin das Feuer. Sie kam aus einem laut gestellten Radio in der Nachbarschaft. Der Sprecher sagte, dass, wenn die Löscharbeiten weiter fortgeschritten seien, auch sowieso, es nannte einen populären Namen, aus seinem hohen Sitz wieder herabsteigen könne. Es war offenbar ein Kranführer oder etwas ähnliches, der wegen des Feuers seinen Sitz nicht verlassen konnte. (179 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3046 (1994-02-18, 05:45 - Zürich)Traum. (Zweiter Traum) Ein Sprecher oder Vertreter des Kriegsministeriums verlas in einer Pressekonferenz Meldungen über das Kriegsgeschehen oder militärische Unternehmungen und sprach dabei auch frei. Er war sehr jung und sah ganz unauffällig und garnicht militärisch aus. Er sprach von einem Udisten und ein Journalist wiederholte verbessernd, ein Utopist. Der Mann sagte ganz unbewegt und ohne die Stimme zu heben, aber irgendwie mit eisernem Gesicht: "Ich sagte Udist", und setzte seine Rede fort. Jetzt wurde mir deutlich, dass es sich trotz seiner Unauffälligkeit doch um eine sehr energische Persönlichkeit handelte. Dann verschwand er hinter einem Vorhang, um irgendetwas zu holen, was in der Pressekonferenz gezeigt werden sollte. Jetzt sah sein Gesicht sehr gespannt oder angespannt aus. Vorher war noch eine andere Traumszene gewesen, in der ich mich selber Schreibmaschine oder Computer schreiben hörte auf einer Ton- oder Videokassette. Es war ein sehr schnelles und flüssiges Schreibgeräusch, und ich war erstaunt darüber und sagte zu Emme, dass ich offenbar schon sehr schnell schreiben könne, merkte dann aber, dass ausserdem noch eine Sekretärin im Raum sass und dass es deren Schreibgeräusch war, das man hörte,. während das meine nur sehr viel langsamer aus dem Hintergrund hindurch klang.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3047 (1994-02-19, 06:15 - Zürich)Ein Platz im Freien, wo allerlei alte Sachen gelagert waren, oder herumlagen, zum Teil auch in Plastiksäcke gefüllt. Andererseits stand dort auch mein Bett und ich hatte mich dort irgendwie eingerichtet, die Säcke in der Nische, die sich daneben gebildet hatte, irgendwie in eine Ordnung nebeneinander gestellt und meine Sachen darauf gelegt, gleichsam sie als Tisch benutzend. Nun kamen aber zwei junge Leute, sehr aufgeregt suchend und schoben alles umher, weil der eine von ihnen dort seine Schlüssel verloren hatte. Ich bremste sie erst etwas, damit sie nicht alles wild durcheinander brachten und half ihnen dann suchen, die Sache irgendwie systematisierend. Bald hatte ich am Boden ein Schlüsselbund gefunden, aber es waren alles alte Schlüssel, was man schon an ihrer Form sehen konnte. Ich zeigte es hochhebend dem jungen Mann, der irgendwie untätig und etwas depremiert auf einem der Säcke sass, und fragte: "Ist es das?". Er antwortete: "Nö, das is es nich". Bald danach fand ich ein zweites, neues Schlüsselbund mit einer Art Ledertasche, dem ich schon anmerkte, dass es das seine sein musste. Ich stand auf, um er ihm zu geben, doch er war zunächst nicht da, hatte sich suchend irgendwohin begeben, kam dann aber wieder und nahm es erfreut. Nun schloss er sich mir an. Die Szene wandelte sich. Es war nun im Inneren eines alten gossen Hauses, gleichsam im gepflasterten Eingangsflur wie in den alten venezianischen Palazzi, die teils heruntergekommen sind. Er verkaufte nun irgendwelche leicht anarchistischen Zeitungen, oder verteilte sie. Wollte mir auch eine geben, aber ich winkte ab und sagte, dass ich sie doch nicht lesen werde. Er hakte mich nun kameradschaftlich ein, und wir gingen in dem Raum auf und ab und unterhielten uns. Ich merkte, dass ich ihn irgendwie zum Weitergehen motivieren müsse, weil er sonst nie mehr gegangen wäre. Ich machte also die grosse Flügeltür des alten Hauses auf. Draussen waren Buden aufgestellt und viele Leute standen umher wie vor einem Jahrmarkt. Er bekam sofort Angst und sagte: "Nö, dahin gehe ich nicht. Da sind so viele Leute". Ich zeigte ihm einen Weg, der seitlich zwischen den Hauswänden und den Buden hindurch ging, die Strasse entlang, und wo nur wenig Menschen waren, und er ging ihn tatsächlich. Vorher waren andere Szenen gewesen. So ging ich in einer von ihnen mit Emme durch die Stadt durch eine Gegend die etwa aussah wie am Schwabentor in Freiburg. Der Weg war teils überdacht, teils im Freien. Es hatte angefangen, stark zu regnen. Emme wollte aber das Wegstück im Freien weiter gehen. Ich schlug ihr vor, andersherum durch das überdachte Stück zu gehen, und sagte, dort kommst Du auch zur Goldschmitte, denn ich hatte gemerkt, dass sie dorthin wollte und die Auslagen betrachten. Man konnte diese Goldschmitte aber sowohl auf dem Weg durchs Freie wie auf dem überdachten Weg erreichen, wo man nur ein kurzes Stück ohne Dach, also im Regen, durchqueren musste. Noch andere Szenen des Traums habe ich jetzt vergessen, obwohl noch etwas wie eine dunkle Erinnerung da ist. (496 words)

Es war eine unheimliche Situation, bei der ich irgendwie verschworene Kumpanen hatte. Auch das Geschehen im Keller des Hauses spielte eine Rolle. Es hatte auch irgendwie einen erotischen Hintergrund. In den Wein wurden Essenzen hereingetan, die ihm wohl einen besonderen Geschmack und Wirkung verliehen. Am Schluss kamen irgendwelche Missetaten der Bande zum Vorschein, in die wir dort geraten waren. Wir liessen sie beunruhigt sein, beschlossen aber im Stillen, sie nicht wirklich zu entlarven, sondern nur stillschweigend wegzugehen und sie im Ungewissen zu lassen, ob ihre Missetaten offenbar werden und sie bestraft werden würden. Es war auch wie die Situation einer Schule oder eines Internats, das sie betrieben. Wir, das heisst einige andere Leute und ich, waren einerseits wie ihre Adepten, andererseits wie hinzugekommene Fremde, die ihre Schliche durchschaut hatten und sie deshalb entlarven konnten. Die Ungewissheit, in der wir sie liessen, sollte ihre Strafe sein. Die ganze Situation war unheimlich und auch undurchschaubar. (184 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3056 (1994-02-24, 04:45 - Zürich)Dr. Peter hatte ein neues Praxisschild aus weissem Milchglas. Es lag noch in seinem Zimmer auf dem Fussboden. Es war ein schmales rechteckiges Schild, wie man es eher im Haus zusammen mit anderen Schildern anbringt, als draussen an der Hauswand, wo die Schilder eine weniger gestreckte Form hatten. Ich war vor einigen Tagen durch den Raum gegangen, wo das Schild lag. Ich hatte irgend eine Hilfsfunktion in der Praxis. Ich war nicht auf das Schild getreten, aber ganz in seine Nähe. Ich hörte damals ein feines Geräusch und sah bei näherer Betrachtung, dass das Schild einen ganz feinen, kaum sichtbaren Riss im Inneren bekommen hatte. Es war aber nicht gebrochen und ich sagte nichts und beschloss, nichts zu sagen. Nun, einige Tage später, fand ich es, als ich in das Zimmer kam, in mehrere Stücke zerbrochen noch an der selben Stelle am Boden liegend. Der Bruch folgte dem Riss. Es musste nachträglich von selbst dort gebrochen sein. Es schien mir nicht gut möglich, jetzt noch etwas zu sagen. Dr. Peter kam kurz danach in den Raum, in dem nun auch noch andere Praxishelfer waren. Als er das gebrochene Schild sah, liess er sich auf die Knie nieder, um es genau zu betrachten und sagte: "Wie kann da ein Riss in das Schild gekommen sein?" Er hatte die Spuren des haarfeinen Risses jetzt nachträglich an der Bruchstelle entdeckt. In dem kurzen Schweigen, dass nach seiner Frage entstand, erwachte ich mit schlechtem Gewissen. Das Gewissen war so schlecht und der Entschluss, nichts zu sagen wirkte wohl so sehr noch nach, dass ich zuerst beschloss, den Traum lieber nicht aufzuschreiben, und mir sagte, er sei ja eigentlich auch garnicht wichtig, sodass es nicht schlimm sei, ihn nicht aufzuschreiben.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3058 (1994-02-26, 02:00 - Zürich)Eine Versammlung oder ein Treffen aller Institutsangehörigen, oder wohl noch eines grösseren Kreises, das zunächst in einer grossen weitläuftigen unterirdischen Höhle stattfand, wo sich alle nach dem Weg durch verschiedenartige Gänge zu einem Zug formierten, den Inge Strauch organisiert hatte. Sie hatte es so arrangiert, dass zwei oder drei andere und ich an die Spitze des Zuges gerieten, weil wir die einzigen regelrechten Beamten waren und auch entsprechend als einzige schwarze Anzüge trugen. Dann gesellte sich noch der Rektor der Universität zu uns, der ebenfalls an der Veranstaltung teilnahm und auch einen schwarzen Anzug trug. Er trat als erster durch einen schmalen Durchgang in's Freie und ich folgte ihm, sodass wir nun an der Spitze des Zuges waren, der im Freien sofort auf eine sehr lebhaft befahrene Strasse geriet. Der Rektor wollte aber auf der Mitte dieser Strasse gehen, was wir auch taten, wobei man aber dauernd herannahende Autos und Motorräder beachten musste, um nicht von ihnen überfahren zu werden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3059 (1994-02-27, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich war in Roggow. Frau von Oertzen hatte eine Art Ämter verteilt. Jeder musste irgendetwas machen. Ich bekam das Amt, für den Ablauf der Dinge zu sorgen. Das war ein ehrenvolles Amt. Ich musste aufpassen, dass bei einer Gesellschaft oder einem Essen oder ähnlichem, immer der richtige nächste Schritt gemacht würde. Sie würde mir wohl sagen, was zu tun wäre. Dann war ich - es war noch früher am Tag - irgendwohin ins Freie gegangen, wo auch viele Leute waren. Man sass auf Stühlen, wohl am Rande eines Teichs. Es war noch sehr kalt, als ich losging. Ich hatte darum einem Mantel mitgenommen und eine Decke. Plötzlich merkte ich, dass es schon recht spät war und ich mich eilen musste, um rechtzeitig zum Essen wieder zurück zu sein. Inzwischen war es sehr warm geworden. Ich hatte darum den Mantel ausgezogen und auch eine Jacke, es war eine helle sommerliche Jacke. Stattdessen hatte ich nun eine leichte Sportsommerjacke an. Es war aber sehr schwierig, alle diese Dinge vor dem Weggehen zu finden. Sie lagen zwischen den Sachen anderer Leute und unter Bettdecken, die auch da waren, mit denen man sich zugedeckt hatte. Es war wie in einem grossen Gemeinschaftslager auf den Stühlen. Ich konnte meine Sachen nicht mehr richtig finden und musste alles umwühlen. Es wurde immer später und bald war mir klar, dass es nun zu spät war und ich nicht mehr rechtzeitig zu dem Essen kommen würde. Auch hatte ich Mühe, alle meine Sachen so über den Arm zu legen, dass ich sie überhaupt gleichzeitig transportieren konnte. Auf einem Stuhl, wo ich noch das letzte suchte, was ich mitnehmen musste, fand ich stattdessen Frauenkleider, die eine Frau ausgezogen hatte, die sich schlafen gelegt hatte. Es war vor allem Unterwäsche. Sie fiel vom Stuhl und ich musste sie am Boden wieder zusammensuchen, um sie wieder auf den Stuhl zu legen, der auch noch umzufallen drohte. Es wurde mir klar, dass der Rückweg einige Zeit beanspruchen würde, und es fiel mir ein, dass ich ja ein wichtiges Amt bei dem Essen hatte, dass offenbar zu einer feierlichen Gelegenheit gehörte, und es wurde mir bewusst, dass ich Frau von Oertzen sehr enttäuschen würde dadurch, dass ich nicht rechtzeitig da war. Ich erwachte mit dem Gefühl sehr schlechten Gewissens und brauchte einige Zeit, um dieses loszuwerden durch die Einsicht, dass es ja nur ein Traum war. Die Szenerie im Traum hatte im Wesentlichen anders ausgesehen als in Roggow. Dass es Roggow war, lag hauptsächlich darin, dass Frau von Oertzen die Dame des Hauses war. (421 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3063 (1994-03-01, 01:45 - Freiburg)In einer psychiatrischen Klinik, die in einem weitläufigen Gebäude untergebracht war, konnte man im Rahmen einer Untersuchung seine Träume abgeben. Zuerst musste man dort seine Personalien angeben, wofür die Leute Schlange standen. Es fand auch ein Seminar statt, wo verschiedene Fragen besprochen wurden. Dabei auch die Frage, warum das Verhältnis von Männern zu Frauen in der Psychologie ein Drittel zu zwei Drittel betrage.Ich äusserte die Vermutung, dass das auch in der Normalbevölkerung so sei, was aber der Seminarleiter verneinte Irgendwo sass auch ein Psychopathologe in dem Gebäude, das hier ein gewisse Ähnlichkeit auch mit der Uni in Zürich hatte. Er trug eine Brille mit kleinen kreisrunden Gläsern, wie man sie den Patienten zu Augenprüfungen aufsetzt, denn es war seine Funktion, die freiwilligen Teilnehmer der Untersuchung auf ihre Sehfähigkeit zu testen. Die Untersuchung fand im Rahmen einer grossen Untersuchung zum Thema Hysterie statt. Wohl zur Bewachung der Untersuchung waren auch Soldaten eingesetzt, die einem wallisischen oder irischen Regiment angehörten. Emme fragte deren Chef, der etwas abseits auf einem Stuhl sass, etwas Ethymologisches, das wohl mit einem komplizierten wallisischen Namen zusammenhing. Es spielte auch die Ethymologie des Wortes Hysterie eine Rolle, das auf das griechische Wort für Gebärmutter zurückgeführt wird. (198 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3065 (1994-03-02, 09:30 - Freiburg)Es klingelt. Ich mache auf. Eine riesenhafte weibliche Person steht vor der Tür mit einer riesenhaften hölzernen Keule, wohl einem Schirm oder ähnlichem, in der Hand, mit dem sie offensichtlich auf mich einschlagen will. Da ich nichts habe, womit ich zurückschlagen kann, stelle ich mich so, dass sie, wenn sie auf mich schlagen will, wegen ihrer riesenhaften Grösse den Türrahmen treffen wird, und schreie sie an, so laut ich kann, um sie einzuschüchtern. Sie wird auch tatsächlich dadurch eingeschüchtert und beginnt nun eine ziemlich hysterisch wirkende Geschichte zu erzählen, die darauf hinausläuft, dass ich ihr helfen soll. Sie hat sich irgendwo mit einer Leistung irgendwelcher Art beworben und keinen Erfolg gehabt, und ich soll für sie sprechen. Ich halte sie hin, lasse sie weiterreden und wimmle sie schliesslich ab, indem ich ihr einen hölzernen Flugroller gebe, der noch da steht. Er ist wie ein Kindertretroller gebaut, hat aber Flügel oder einen Propeller, die man mit kräftigem Treten eines Antriebsbrettes so in Bewegung setzen kann, dass der Roller sich in die Lüfte erhebt. Glücklicherweise ist sie nicht ungeschickt und kann schon bei langsamer Geschwindigkeit gut auf dem Roller balancieren. Draussen ist ein bellendes Hündchen, das sie auch noch auf den Roller lässt. Offenbar ist es ihr Hündchen. Emme und ich sind etwas besorgt, ob sie nicht abstürzen wird, sehen aber, dass die Gefahr nicht gross ist, weil sie sehr geschickt ist. Ich empfehle ihr für alle Fälle, ganz dicht über dem Erdboden zu fliegen, und erwache. (245 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3066 (1994-03-02, 05:30 - Freiburg)Ich hatte zwei Stapel von Rezepten, in jeder Hand einen, die sich auf zwei verschiedene Personen, Verwandte von mir, wie Bruder und Schwester oder Vater und Kind, oder ähnlich, bezogen. Damit ging ich zu einem Apotheker, der auf Grund dieser Rezepte irgendeine Bescheinigung ausstellen oder etwas ähnliches tun musste. Es war eine Formalität. Der ganze Stapel von Rezepten war jeweils in der selben Handschrift geschrieben. Ich glaube, es waren auch beide Stapel insgesamt in der selben Handschrift, einer bewegten harmonischen, relativ grossen Schrift, mit blauer Tinte geschrieben. Der Apotheker blätterte die Stapel durch und stutzte bei einem bestimmten Rezept, nahm es heraus, sah es genau an und bekam einen forschenden Blick Es war anscheinend ein Rezept, das in seiner eigenen Apotheke ausgeführt worden war. Er fragte ein Kind, das dabei stand, ob es sich erinnere. Es sei ein relativ kleiner Mann gewesen mit eher schmalem Kopf, der das Rezept gebracht und das Medikament geholt hatte. Ich erinnerte mich, es war ein Rezept für meinen Vater gewesen, aber meine Erinnerung war merkwürdig unklar, obwohl ich gerade erst mit meinem Vater da gewesen war. Während der Apotheker weitere Nachforschungen anstellte, was mich wunderte, wurde mir plötzlich klar, dass mein Vater ja bereits vor 46 Jahren gestorben ist, ich aber gerade erst mit ihm in dieser Apotheke war. Der Apotheker musste etwas von diesem Zeitwiderspruch gespürt haben und deshalb das Bedürfnis haben, die Geschichte dieses Rezeptes, das er selber ausgeführt hatte, zu erforschen. Im Erwachen kam mir noch in den Sinn, dass ich ja mit meinem Vater am Tag des Angriffs der Deutschen gegen Russland im Jahre 1941 (22.6.41) in der Apotheke gewesen sei, weil ihm eine Streichholzschachtel in der Hand explodiert war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3067 (1994-03-03, 02:00 - Freiburg)Traum:Ich sollte eine Vorlesung halten über das Wesen der Wirtschaft. Ich hatte das Thema ganz leichtfertig akzeptiert und gedacht: "Es wird mir schon etwas dazu einfallen".Jetzt war es soweit. Ich war unmittelbar vor der Vorlesung in der Universität und garnicht vorbereitet. Ich dachte in den letzten Minuten vor Beginn der Vorlesung fieberhaft nach und mir fiel nun einiges ein: Dass der Mensch ein Homo oeconomicus ist und Wirtschaften zu seiner Natur gehört. Dass es gleichsam einen Trieb zum Besitz gibt. Ich dachte an Schultz-Henckes Besitzstreben, die Kaptativität, das Haben- und Behaltenwollen, und beschloss, mit der Szene am Beginn der Göttlichen Komödie anzufangen, wo die drei Tiere dem Dante den Weg versperren und ihn zum Umweg durch die Hölle und das Paradies zwingen und eines dieser Tiere die hungrige Wölfin ist. Dann fiel mir noch Heideggers Vortrag über das Wesen der Technik ein und dass zu dieser technischen Verfügung des Menschen über die Natur, in der er selbst verfügt wird, auch die Wirtschaft gehört. Es wurde mir klar, dass so die erste Vorlesung auf jeden Fall gerettet sein würde, obwohl es eine zweistündige Vorlesung sein sollte. Aber ich hatte keine Uhr bei mir und das Gefühl, dass ich die Zeit vielleicht schon verpasst haben könnte. Ich hastete durch das Treppenhaus der Universität herab, denn ich war in einem der oberen Stockwerke und die Vorlesung sollte im Erdgeschoss stattfinden. Im Eifer geriet ich dabei eine Treppe zu tief ins Untergeschoss, musste umkehren und wieder ein Stück die Treppe hinauf laufen. Gespannt trat ich in den Lichthof, wo ich die Uhr sehen konnte, die hier auf einen Untergrund gemalt war, der halb leer und weiss war, sodass die Uhr kleiner war, als in den oberen Stockwerken. Es war schon fünf Minuten vor Halb.Ich hatte also bereits zehn Minuten Verspätung und dachte mir einen Entschuldigungssatz aus, in dem ich sagen wollte, dass meine Uhr nachgegangen sei, hatte aber bei der Vorstellung ein schlechtes Gewissen, weil man doch nicht lügen soll. Ich fürchtete auch, dass die Leute schon wieder weggegangen sein könnten und der Hörsaal leer sein würde. Als ich den Hörsaal betrat, war er aber ganz voll und die Leute sassen freundlich wartend und erwartungsvoll da, hatten die Wartezeit offenbar nicht als solche empfunden. Ich ging in den Hörsaal und erwachte. (377 words)

Da er sehr kräftig und rücksichtslos aussieht, ergreife ich die Flucht und stürze aus dem Gebäude.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3069 (1994-03-04, 23:30 - Freiburg)Traum:Wirrer Traum, in dem ein Arzt eine Ärztin, ohne es zu wollen, praktisch umbringt,.bei einem Versuch, in dem Abgase in ein Auto geleitet werden. Sie hatte ihn durch herausfordernde Reden sehr gereizt, was wohl dazu führte, dass er einen Fehler in der Dosierung machte. Plötzlich merkte er, dass sie nicht mehr richtig reagierte, und rief: "Sie ist ja" - ich erwartete, dass er sagen würde: "bewusstlos geworden" Stattdessen sagte aber sie selbst, die Augen noch einmal öffnend: "tot", und war im selben Moment auch wirklich tot. Bei dem Versuch sollte ein Unfall oder Verbrechen rekonstruiert werden, wobei es vor allem um die Frage ging, wie weit man trotz des Rauschens des Gases das Rollen der Räder, beziehungsweise eines bestimmten Rades, noch hören konnte. Gleichzeitig war es auch wie ein Fahrzeug im Wasser, ein Motorboot etwa. Ich erwachte sehr entsetzt und bestürzt und konnte mich nicht entschliessen, den Traum aufzuschreiben, schlief wieder ein und träumte nun, dass ein Psychotherapeut oder Tiefenpsychologe mir den Traum deutete. Er sagte, es bedeute, dass Teile von mir andere Teile unterdrückten, und es käme darauf an, dass alle Teile sich gleich entfalten können. Auch nach dem erneuten Erwachen war ich von dem Traum noch bestürzt, ohne die gegebene Deutung richtig in mich aufnehmen zu können, und brauchte lange, bis ich mich entschloss, den Traum aufzuschreiben, den ich zuerst eigentlich lieber unterdrücken und vergessen wollte.

Das war ein sehr angenehmes Gefühl. Wir hatten leichte schwebende Kleidungsstücke an In einer Pause war ich hinausgegangen und hatte dafür eine Trainingshose und einen Bademantel darüber gezogen. Im Treppenhaus begegnete mir an der Tür eines anderen Probenraums der Theaterregisseur, der dort ebenfalls mit seinen Leuten probte. Die meine war eine Laientruppe. Er sagte freundlich anerkennend, als er mich sah: "Ah, ist es Rokoko". Er hatte meine Bekleidung als Rokokokostüm aufgefasst, und es wurde mir klar, dass sie auch genauso aussah, wenn man wusste, dass sie Rokoko darstellte. Besonders freute ich mich aber über seine freundlich anerkennende Zuwendung. Ich sagte, dass noch andere leichtere Bekleidung darunter war. (129 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3072 (1994-03-05, 00:00 - Freiburg)Ein Junge im Pubertätsalter, der seiner Mutter widersprach. Es waren, glaube ich Farbige. Er wollte etwas, was sie nicht wollte, etwas im Grunde Belangloses, wie zum Beispiel abends noch hinaus gehen, oder irgendwohin gehen. Sie verbot es immer mehr und er sagte trotzig: "Ich tue es trotzdem". Schliesslich war sie ausser sich vor Wut und sagte: "Du bist enterbt". Ich sagte zu dem Jungen: "Du musst es nicht tragisch nehmen. Sie wird sich wieder beruhigen". Es sagte: "Soll ich dann den Kopfschmuck trotzdem tragen?" Es war eine Art Metallstück, das er balancierend auf dem Kopf trug, etwa wie der ""Kürbiskopf. Jetzt wurde mir klar, dass hier ein grosses Poroblem lag, denn wenn er enterbt war, durfte er es nicht tragen. Dann aber würde es in der Öffentlichkeit offenbar werden, und das würde die Familie zerbrechen. Ich geriet nun im Traum irgendwie in die Rolle des Vaters, wenigstens in der Sicht des Jungen, blieb aber trortzdem irgendwie zugleich der Zuschauer. Als Vater konnte ich nicht endgültig die Frage entscheiden, denn es war offenbar eine mutterrechtliche Gesellschaft. Aber es wurde mir klar, dass ich das Problem lösen musste, weil sonst die Familie auseinanderbrechen würde. Ich musstre mit der Mutter sprechen und ihr klar machen, dass es sich um eine Bagatelle handelte und dass es zur normalen Altersentwicklung des Jungen gehörte, in der Pubertätssziet zu widersprechen und vor allem, dass sie sich bewusst machen müsste, dass sie die Familie zerbrechen würde, wenn sie die Enterbunbg nicht zurücknehmen würde.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3073 (1994-03-05, 05:30 - Feiburg)Verschiedene junge Leite, die sich um einen bestimmten Job beworben hatten, waren an einem Ort versammelt, wo sie dafür getestet wurden. Ich gehörte auch dazu. Man musste einen solchen Job machen, etwa im Alter von achtzehn, neunzehn Jahren. Es stand im Zusammenhang mit einer Einrichtung ähnlich wie Arbeitsdienst oder Kriegshilfsdienst. Es war also nicht möglich, überhaupt keine solche Arbeit zu machen, sondern nur, sich für eine zu bewerben, die angenehmer oder interessanter als andere war. Unter den jungen Männern und Frauen, die da zusammen waren, waren viele, die die Namen berühmter Flieger des ersten Weltkriegs trugen. So hiess zum Beispiel eines der Mädchen von Manteuffel. Bei den Testtätigkeiten, die man machen musste, konnte man leicht Fehler machen. So musste man darauf achten, ob bestimmte Sachen auch geschlossen waren, und so weiter. Alle machten irgendwelche Fehler, ich auch. Ich liess irgendetwas fallen. Es war interessant, die einzelnen Personen in dieser Situation zu vergleichen. Einige sprachen viel, andere waren eher schweigsam. Ich gehörte zu dem letzteren. Es wurde mir allmählich klar, wie schlecht es ist, wenn Menschen in dieser schöpferischen Lebenszeit ein ganzes Jaht lang Dinge tun müssen, die im Grunde langweilig sind, und diese wichtige Entwicklungszeit nicht richtig für ihr eigenes Leben ausnutzen können. Ich dachte aber im Stillen, dass man mich wegen meines hohen Alters davon befreien würde. Ich hatte also offenbar in dieser Phase des Traums wieder mein wirkliches Alter über sechzig. (233 words)

Da kam unsere grosse weisse Gans herbei, tauchte ihren Schnabel in den Teller und begann, den Rum in einem Zug zu trinken. Ich rief Emme zu, man müsse sie daran hindern, weil sie sonst betrunken würde, aber Emme tat nichts und war wohl fasziniert von dem Anblick. Ich stellte mir schon vor, wie die Gans betrunken umhertorkelte. Sie stand aber noch fest da und ich merkte, dass es fast nicht möglich war, ihr den Hals aus dem Rum zu ziehen, als ich es nun selbst versuchte, weil sie ihn mit ungeheurer Energie dort hin hielt.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3079 (1994-03-08, 06:25 - Zürich)Wir hatten eine wunderschöne Wohnung am Rande einer Stadt im Grünen mit einer Wiese vor der Tür. In dem grossen Zimmer, dessen Glastür auf die Wiese blickte, lagen unsere beiden blauen Gabbeh-Teppiche. Als ich nach Haus kam, waren die Gabbehteppiche weg. Offensichtlich war eingebrochen worden und die Teppiche waren gestohlen. Eine Ziege, die wir auch hatten, stand mitten im Zimmer und rieb ihre Nase an der Glastür, als ob sie zeigen wollte, dass diese nur angelehnt sei und aufginge. Ich überlegte noch, was geschehen würde, wenn sie die Tür aufbekäme und auch wegliefe. Dann andere Szene. Ich kam mit Emme heim. Kurz bevor wir in das Zimmer gingen, fiel mir wieder ein, dass die Teppiche weg waren und ich sagte zu Emme: "Unsere Teppiche sind gestohlen". Sie sagte "Ach!"und war sehr unglücklich und enttäuscht. Ich sagte: "In dieser Gegend kann man nicht wohnen", denn es war trotz der landschaftlichen Schönheit eine heruntergekommene Gegend. In einer weiteren Szene, war ein junger Mann da, der irgendwie in die Wohnung eingedrungen war und nett aussah, aber ein Ganove war. Ich versuchte ihm klar zu machen, dass sich diese Existenz für ihn nicht lohne und immer mehr ins Unglück führen würde. Er schien irgendwie davon überzeugt zu werden und zog seine Pistole aus der Tasche, um sie wegzuwerfen, zögerte dann aber doch und konnte sich noch nicht entschliessen. Andere Szene: Wir kamen wieder heim und merkten, dass Leute in der Wohnung waren. Es waren Verwandte, ein junges Paar, und sie hatten einen Weihnachtsbaum mitgebracht, der sehr schön geschmückt war und in der Stube stand. Auf dem Boden lag ein Perserteppich. Wir waren gerührt und ich gab der Frau, die mit verschiedenen Verwandten Ähnlichkeit hatte, einen Kuss. Der Mann begann zu sprechen und war jetzt Adelheids Mann Gerhard Jaeckel, aber in jungem Alter, und die Frau war jetzt Adelheid, ebenfalls noch in jungem Alter. Er sagte. Die Gabbeh-Teppiche sind zwar hübscher, aber so Seide. Er rümpfte dabei etwas die Nase um anzudeuten, das das Material nicht so gut sei wie das des Perserteppichs. Jetzt wurde mir klar, dass Adelheid gut meinend den edlen Perserteppich mitgebracht hatte und dass sie die Gabbehteppiche nur aufgerollt und versteckt hatte. Wir waren sehr erleichtert, dass also diese noch da waren, und ich überlegte, dass wir sie wieder auslegen würden, wenn die beiden abgereist wären, und den Perserteppich in ein anderes Zimmer tun oder aufrollen würden. Schwierig würde es nur werden, wenn sie wieder zu Besuch kämen. Irgendwann, als ich hinausging, merkte ich, dass mir ein Zahn ausgefallen war. Ich fand ihn noch im Mund. Er war aber an einer Stelle irgendwo hinten ausgefallen, wo man es nicht sah, sodass ich es nicht so schlimm fand. Ich beschloss, ihn dem Zahnarzt zu zeigen, zu dem ich heute gehen wollte.

Sie fragten, wieviele Semester ich dort gewesen war. Ich konnte das aber nicht mehr genau sagen, weil es eine längere Zeit gewesen war, die ich sozusagen nicht gezählt hatte. Sie stellten aber aus der Berechnung der Jahre fest, dass es viele Semester gewesen sein mussten. Da sie selber jünger waren und damals noch nicht gelebt hatten, erlosch das Gespräch darüber aber bald wieder. Vorher hatten wir über andere Dinge gesprochen, an die ich mich jetzt nicht mehr erinnere. (100 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3081 (1994-03-10, 06:00 - Zürich)Wir wollten in eine Aufführung, wohl von einem Theaterstück oder Konzert, gehen und waren etwas vorher da. Es war eine alte Fabrikanlage oder ähnliches, die man für kulturelle Unternehmungen und Aufführungen zurecht gemacht hatte. Ein Mann, den ich von der Universität kannte, wohl ein Privatdozent, begegnete uns und sagte: "Ah, jetzt könnte ich Ihnen eigentlich gleich die Bände geben". Es handelte sich um irgend einen Veröffentlichung, an der ich mitwirkte. Ich erinnerte mich aber nicht mehr genau. Er lief vor mir eine Kellertreppe herunter, und mir wurde klar, dass er in diesem Gebäudekomplex offenbar eine Art Verlagsraum hatte. Unten in einem kellerartigen Lagerraum, der für seine Zwecke zurechtgemacht war, gab er mir einen dicken Band, auf dem als Titel gleichsam aus Objekten das Wort Psychologie gebildet war. Statt des zweiten O war aber ein Buchstabengebilde da, das wie ein I aussah, sodass man Psycholigie las. Das Ganze war eine Art surrealistisches Arrangement und er fragte, ob ich es besser fände, wenn dort auch ein O sei. Die O's waren durch irgendwie vorgehängte runde Objekte, eine Art Nüsse gebildet. Ich sagte, es wäre wohl besser dort auch ein O zu nehmen, weil die Leute es sonst nicht verstehen würden. Mir war aber immer noch nicht klar, beziehungsweise ich konnte mich immer noch nicht richtig besinnen, welche Aufgabe ich bei dem Band hatte. Ich musste wohl einen Beitrag dafür schreiben, denn dass ich den ganzen Band machen sollte, schien mir unwahrscheinlich. Es war wohl als ein Band in einem Sammelwerk gedacht, dessen Titel ich aber vergessen hatte. Dann Szenenwechsel. Ich war zu Hause in der Wohnung und gerade aufgestanden. Emme war noch beim Anziehen. Da kam ein Professor, der sich zu einem Gespräch angesagt hatte. Ich hatte das vergessen und erinnerte auch den Namen des Professors und den Zweck des Gesprächs nicht mehr. Ich ging zur Tür, um zu öffnen. Die Wohnung war in der Zimmeranordnung und der Art des Flurs genau wie die Wohnung in meinem Elternhaus in Schwerin, was mir aber im Traum nicht auffiel, denn es war unsere jetztige Wohnung. Die Tür aber, die in Schwerin eine Glastür war, war hier aus rohem Holz und wirkte irgendwie improvisiert. Ich öffnete sie und gegenüber der Tür war in geringem Abstand eine zweite Wand aus rohem Holz. Zwischen beiden musste wie in einem Gang der Mann hindurchgehen, um in die Wohnung zu kommen. Ich sagte etwas Entschuldigendes, wie, dass es hier sehr improvisiert sei, oder ähnliches. Der Mann, an dessen Aussehen ich mich ja nicht erinnerte, war ein noch ziemlich junger Mann, der eigentlich eher wie ein junger Assistent aussah. Ich war erleichtert, denn das machte die Bewältigung der Situation etwas einfacher. Ich überlegte, wo ich ihn sitzen lassen sollte, ehe ich mit ihm dahin ging, wo wir die Besprechung halten könnten, denn in die Wohnzimmer konnte ich ihn schlecht führen, weil sie recht unordentlich waren und Emme noch beim Anziehen. Er öffnete aber einfach die Tür zum Wohnzimmer und ging hinein. Nun merkte ich, dass noch ein anderer, mittelalter Mann mit hagerem Gesicht und eher strenger Miene hinterherkam. Das war also der Professor und der andere wirklich der Assistent. Sie setzten sich in die Sessel. Es waren die selben Sessel, die es in diesem Zimmer in meinem Elternhaus gab, und sie standen an der selben Stelle im Raum. Emme, die auf den Besuch garnicht vorbereitet war und von ihm nichts wusste, war glücklicher Weise schon fertig mit dem Anziehen, brauchte aber offenbar noch irgendetwas, wofür sie, um es zu holen, auf die Couch steigen musste. Der Professor schaute etwas erstaunt aber doch mit unerschütterter Miene. Da ich nicht wusste, wie er hiess, und ihn also nicht vorstellen konnte, sagte ich : "Darf ich Sie mit meiner Frau bekanntmachen" und hoffte, dass er, wie es die meisten Leute in dieser Situation reflexartig tun, daraufhin seinen Namen nennen würde. Er schaute zu ihr auf, da sie immer noch auf der Couch stand, und ich erwachte. (653 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3082 (1994-03-11, 06:00 - Zürich)Zwei junge Männer, die in einem Konzert singen sollten. Jeder von beiden wollte die selbe Partie singen. So musste das Los entscheiden, wer welche der beiden Partien singen sollte. Ebenso standen zwei Zimmer für sie für die Nacht zur Verfügung, eines parterre, eines in der ersten Etage des Hauses. Jeder von beiden wollte in dem oberen Zimmer wohnen, sodass auch hier das Los entscheiden musste. (65 words)

Er sagte: "Niesen ist so inhaltsleer", womit er meinte, dass einem dazu nichts einfallen kann, weil es keinen Inhalt hat. (50 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3085 (1994-03-14, 03:30 - Zürich)Zu unserer Eigentumswohnung gehörte ausser dem relativ kleinen Kellerabteil auch noch ein eine Etage tiefer gelegener Tiefkeller. Als ich gerade dort war, kam Frau Biber hineingelaufen und sagte:"Das ist unser Keller. Da muss ich meine Sachen unterbringen". Sie hatte eine andere Wohnung in dem Haus gekauft und glaubte, dass der Keller dazu gehöre. Ich sagte ihr, dass es unser Keller sei, den wir mit der Wohnung gekauft hätten. Sie war nur schwer zu überzeugen und ging nur zögernd. Ich überlegte, ob man ein Schloss an die Kellertür machen sollte, fand das aber doch zu demonstrativ. Es fiel mir ein, dass der Keller, glaube ich, im Kaufvertrag garnicht ausdrücklich genannt war, sondern wohl nur gesagt war, dass die Kellerverhältnisse so bleiben sollten, wie sie bei den Käufern schon als Mieter bestanden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3086 (1994-03-25, 04:30 - Zürich)Ich musste in die Universität gehen. Es war schon spät geworden und ich noch nicht fertig. So hatte ich falsche Sachen in meiner Mappe. Ich schüttete diese einfach auf dem Bett aus, um die falschen raus und die richtigen rein zu tun in die Mappe. Aber es war viel zu dunkel. Ich sagte zu Emme, sie solle doch das Licht anmachen. Doch sie fand so schnell den Knipser der Lampe nicht, sodass ich ungeduldig auch dorthin langte. Unsere Finger trafen sich auf dem Knipser und wir drückten ihn beide. Aber das Licht der Lampe war nur sehr schwach, sodass man die Dinge kaum sehen konnte. Hastig suchte ich die benötigten Dinge raus und kippte sie in die Mappe. Nun war die Zeit schon sehr knapp geworden. Da bemerkte ich, dass ich noch garnicht angezogen war. Ich begann eilig meine Kleider zusammen zu suchen, doch da schlug die Uhr neun. Ich musste aber um neun schon in der Uni sein. Ich überlegte, was ich dort eigentlich wollte, und es fiel mir ein, dass ich dort nur Nachrichten hören wollte, die um neun Uhr begannen. Das konnte ich doch genausogut auch bleiben lassen. Dann hätte ich Zeit, alles in Ruhe zu machen. Es war mir aber klar, dass ich auch dann nicht trödeln durfte, denn die Zeit verging schnell, und sicher war bald der nächste Termin. Ich erwachte mit Kopfschmerzen. (228 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3089 (1994-03-18, 04:15 - Zürich)Wir waren in einem Teil der Stadt, in dem wegen der Enge der Strassen den Autos Dinge erlaubt waren, die ihnen sonst verboten sind, wie zum Beispiel rückwärts fahren, oder linksfahren, weil auf diese Weise auch grosse Autos und Lastwagen noch aneinander vorbeikommen konnten. Bille nutzte diese Möglichkeiten exzessiv aus und fuhr dauernd links und immer wieder rückwärts. Sie bog auch in Höhlen ein, in die man ausnahmsweise hineinfahren durfte. Die Höhlen waren geheimnisvoll und mit plastischen Bildern ausgestattet. Sie standen auch untereinander in Verbindung, waren aber an bestimmten Stellen auch mit Wasser ausgefüllt. Ein Mann, der für eine Höhle einen Schlüssel für bestimmte Besonderheiten besass, weil er dort sein Auto parken durfte, zeigte uns, wie man einen bestimmten Mechanismus aufschliessen und dann bedienen konnte, durch den sich im Felsen eine Tür öffnete, die irgendwie plastisch umrandet und mit einem Gesicht versehen war. Wenn man den Mechanismus in Gang setzte, öffnete sich die Felsentür und setzte den Durchgang zu einer anderen Höhle frei, die aber niedriger war und ein anders angelegtes Wegesystem hatte, so dass man aufpassen musste, sich in ihr nicht festzufahren. Es gab auch Führer in den Höhlen, die den Leuten die Gags erklären konnten. Einer von ihnen hatte Ähnlichkeit mit Christian von Ferber. Dieser Führer schwamm teilweise auch im Wasser und entfernte sich dabei in dem Höhlengang, sodass seine Stimme dann fern und echoartig klang. Dann waren wir wieder draussen vor den Höhlen und man sah Bille in altmodischen Autos rückwärts fahren. Vorher war noch eine andere Szene gewesen, in der wir mit dem Zug durch einen Bahnhof fuhren, in dem der Zug zwar anhielt, man aber eigentlich nicht aussteigen durfte. Wir taten es trotzdem, wie alle Leute, die dort wohnten oder in diesen Ort mussten, aber man musste es heimlich tun, wenn die Schaffner gerade nicht hinsahen, und aufpassen, dass man entgegenkommenden Zügen ausweichen konnte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3090 (1994-03-19, 03:15 - Zürich)Wir waren in einem Raum zusammen, Bille und Belli und ich. Ich stand in der Mitte des Raums, Bille sass am Fenster und Belli an der linken Seite von mir. Jeder tat irgend etwas. Belli fragte mich: "Was tust Du?" Ich: " Ich träume so vor mich hin." Belli: "Was?" Ich: "Ich war in einer Versammlung von Ärzten und anderen. Es ging um Gesundheitspolitik. Sie redeten über Billes Zulassung als Psychotherapeutin. Jemand hatte gesagt: 'Wir dürfen sie nicht ganz ausschliessen' Damit waren die Angehörigen der philosophischen Fakultät gemeint. Darum haben sie Bille zugelassen." Belli fragte dann offenbar, ob es ein richtiger Traum gewesen war, und ich antwortete: "Es war an der Grenze des Traums." Es waren richtige Traumbilder gewesen und ich hatte die Gespräche der Leute gleichsam richtig gehört, aber das Bewusstsein, dass ich in dem Raum stand, in dem Belli und Bille waren, doch zugleich nicht ganz verloren. Es war also etwas mehr als ein Wachtraum und etwas weniger als ein richtiger Traum. Das Ganze spielte sich aber in einem richtigen Traum ab, in dem ich mit Bille und Belli in einem Zimmer war und aus dem ich dann erwachte und mich im Bett liegend vorfand. Ich war also im Traum gleichsam zugleich in zwei Räumen, dem, in dem ich in der Mitte stand, während Belli und Bille auf Stühlen sassen und irgendetwas taten, und dem, in dem ich mit den Ärzten und Politikern zusammen war, die das Gespräch über Psychotherapiezulassungen führten, und in dessen Verlauf sie sich entschlossen, Bille zuzulassen, weil sie nicht alle Nichtmediziner ganz ausschliessen wollten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3091 (1994-03-19, 06:15 - Zürich)Ich stand mit Ulrich Moser an einer Hausecke beim Bertholdsbrunnen in Freiburg. Er erzählte mir von seinen neuen Forschungen und Theorien, die darauf hinausliefen, dass alles, was uns fest und bleibend scheint, in Wirklichkeit immer in Bewegung und im Fluss ist, weil auch das scheinbar Feste sich in Wirklichkeit ständig wandelt. Ich stimmte ihm zu und sagte: So waren zum Beispiel einmal hier, wo wir jetzt stehen, früher Gräber, weil ich das aus einem Buch über Freiburg wusste. Er schien über diese Konkretisierung und Anschaulichmachung seiner Theorien im Moment irgendwie erstaunt und frappiert. (93 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3093 (1994-03-20, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte einen hölzernen Sitzhocker, dessen Holz auf der rechten Hälfte der Rückseite schon etwas angefressen aussah, während die linke noch ganz in Ordnung war. Es ging um die Frage der Reparatur. Jemand schlug eine tiefgreifende Reparatur vor, während ich fand, dass eine leichte Reparatur ganz genügen werde, weil der Hocker noch völlig tragfähig war und es sich eigentlich bloss um eine aesthetische Sache handelte, die sich leicht in Ordnung bringen liess und die sich ausserdem auf der Unterseite befand, die man nur sah, wenn man den Hocker umdrehte. Dann waren zwei Filme da, die beide nicht entwickelt waren. Auf der zylindrischen Schachtel des einen stand "von Matt", und ich nahm an, dass er Herrn von Matt gehöre, wusste aber nicht mehr, wie er dann zu mir gekommen war. Ich nahm beide Filme heraus und verwechselte sie dann schnell, sodass ich bald nicht mehr wusste, welcher derjenige war, auf dessen Schachtel "von Matt" gestanden hatte. Ich war auch nicht mehr sicher, ob er wirklich ihm gehörte, oder die Aufschrift sich auf irgendetwas bezog, was ich selbst photographiert hatte. Ich kam zu dem Schluss, dass ich sie einfach entwickeln lassen müsste, um diese Frage entscheiden zu können und zu sehen, welcher Film der mit der Aufschrift war.In einer anderen, wohl früheren, Szene des Traums hatte ich mehrere neue Cordhosen gekauft in einem Laden, der sehr teuer war. Ich hatte nicht nach dem Preis gefragt, weil ich die Hosen dringend brauchte und in anderen Läden nicht gefunden hatte, war jetzt aber doch in Bezug auf den zu erwarteten Preis besorgt. (258 words)

Sie holte mich aber ein und warf im Scherz einen Schwamm nach mir. Wir machten uns aus irgend welchen Dingen einen Schlitten, mit dem wir sehr elegant zusammen auf der sehr glatten Strasse fuhren. Bille wollte einen Weg wählen, der herunter zum See führte. Es war wie in Schwerin in der Gegend der Münzstrasse. Ich fand aber, dass der herabführende Weg zu steil war, sodass wir verunglücken könnten. Nach einiger Zeit stand Bille auf und sagte, dass sie wieder zu Fuss gehen wollte. Ich erwachte. (131 words)

Ich ging im Inneren die Wagen entlang, bis ich an einen solchen kam, in dem Leute sassen, die schon auf die Reise warteten. Hier kehrte ich um und ging in die Richtung zur Lokomotive zurück. Auf einmal, noch ehe ich vorne war, wo man wieder aussteigen konnte, setzte der Zug sich in Bewegung. Ich hastete nach vorne, denn ich wusste, dass er sehr lange fahren und erst an einer entfernten Station wieder halten würde, von der aus es nicht möglich war, noch am selben Tage wieder zurück zu kommen,und ich hatte abends einen wichtigen Termin. Als ich vorne ankam, war die Geschwindigkeit schon so gross, dass man nicht mehr aussteigen konnte. Aber zu meinem Glück bog der Zug um eine sehr scharfe Kurve, wobei er so langsam fahren musste, dass ich hier aussteigen konnte. Als ich gerade draussen war, begann die Lokomotive, zusammen mit dem ersten noch leeren Wagen, langsam umzusinken, weil die Kurve wohl zu scharf für sie gewesen war. Ich überlegte noch kurz, ob ich an mein Gepäck, eine Art grosse Aktentasche, gelangen könne, sah aber dass das unmöglich sein würde, weil das Gepäck in dem umsinkenden Wagen zusammengeschüttelt würde, und erwachte.

Ich sollte dabei auf das Wort Essen kommen, merkte dies und ging in der Weise auf das Spiel ein, dass ich immer andere Dinge sagte.

Es war jetzt auch eine Ampel am anderen Ende des Zebrastreifens zu sehen. Sie wurde rot, ehe ich das Ende erreicht hatte. Ein Radfahrer dort wollte nicht warten. Ich ging aber unbeirrt weiter und zwang ihn so, anzuhalten und mich zuerst den Zebrastreifen zu Ende überqueren zu lassen. Ein Polizist, der dort stand sah das.

Gadamer war unheimlich flink und geschickt im Falten und Aufstellen der Decken. Dann war das Regal voll und für die Kissen neben den Decken kein Platz mehr. Ich schlug vor, diese oben auf das Regal zu tun, und auch hier packte Gadamer sehr schnell zu und stapelte die Kissen sehr geschickt dort oben, so dass es gleich sehr ordentlich aussah. Nun waren nur noch die Laken zu falten und irgendwie unterzubringen. Ich sagte: Das tue ich morgen, und Gadamer stimmte begeistert zu und sagte: Jetzt trinken wir erst mal einen Kaffee. Es war mir im Traum bewusst, dass er schon über neunzig war. Das Zimmer sah nun schon sehr viel ordentlicher aus und ich sagte dies, ehe wir zum Kaffee gingen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3116 (1994-04-04, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte ein Buch mit sehr schönen umfangreichen Handschriftbeispielen. Es gehörte meinem Vater und hatte auch eine handschriftliche Widmung der Autorin. Es war auch eine Handschriftprobe darin, als deren Verfasser Rafael v.Uslar angegeben war. Es war eine schöne Schrift mit grossen Wortabständen, in der auch sehr viele griechische Zitate auf griechisch geschrieben standen. Es war eine nachdenkliche Schrift, und ich machte mir klar, dass die grossen Wortabstände zeigten, wie der Schreiber nachdenklich einer Sachen nachgesonnen hatte. Emme kam herein und ich sagte: Schau mal diese Schrift an, und wollte ihr diese Schrift meines Vaters zeigen, ohne zunächst seinen Namen zu nennen. Beim Blättern zum Wiedersuchen der Schrift in dem Buch kam mir in den Sinn, dass es auch die Schrift meines Grossvaters sein könnte, der ebenfalls Rafael v. Uslar hiess. Ich dachte, dass ich nachher nachsehen müsse, ob nähere Angaben bei dem Namen stünden, und erwachte. Nach dem Erwachen beschäftigte mich die Absicht, dies nachzusehen noch eine Weile, bis mir ganz klar wurde, dass das nicht ginge, weil das Buch ja nur ein geträumtes Buch war. Ich hatte beim Durchblättern noch gesehen, dass in diesem Band - es waren mehrere Bände voller Handschriften - vorne auch noch eine Widmung eines Kollegen an meinen Vater stand. Es war wohl ein Offizier zur Zeit des ersten Weltkrieges gewesen, der die Widmung geschrieben hatte. (221 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3118 (1994-04-06, 04:30 - Zürich)Ein kleiner Junge, der Andri hiess, aber nicht mit Billes Andri identisch war, spielte mit anderen Kindern auf einem Weg am Rand eines Abhanges in einer kiesgrubenartigen Landschaft. Ich sagte, er solle nicht zu nahe an den Rand gehen, aber er tat es doch und rutschte ab, konnte sich nicht halten und kullerte den Hang herunter, aber, ohne anzustossen. Er kam erst am Rande des unteren Bodens, der teilweise mit flachem Wasser bedeckt war, zum Halten und begann nun, sich wieder hoch zu arbeiten, geriet dabei aber in das pfützenartige Wassergelände hinein. Nun sah man von dort ein Tier kommen, das den Hang hinauf lief. Es hatte etwa die Grösse eines Hundes, war aber offensichtlich ein kleines Pferd. Die Kinder riefen angstvoll: "Ein Pferd!". Es war aber harmlos und entfernte sich, als es den oberen Rand des Hanges erreicht hatte. Nun sah ich aber den Jungen nicht mehr und er antwortete auch nicht auf Rufen. Ich sagte den anderen Kindern, sie sollten genau beobachten, ob sie ihn entdeckten, und lief den Hang hinunter. Unten entdeckte ich ihn, noch immer kriechend sich bewegend, aber sehr erschöpft und mit Mühe den Kopf über das flache Wasser haltend. Ich lief auf ihn zu, um ihn aufzuheben und herauf zu tragen, hatte noch den Gedanken, dass er hoffentlich kein Wasser geschluckt habe, und erwachte. Nach dem Erwachen überlegte ich noch kurz, was ich tun müsse, um eventuell geschlucktes Wasser heraus zu bringen und begriff dann, dass es ja nur ein Traum war. (248 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3120 (1994-04-07, 01:00 - Zürich)Gespräch mit einem Musikwissenschaftler über den Zusammenhang von Synphonie und Volkslied am Beispiel von solchen Synphonien, wo die Komponisten Volkslieder zitiert haben. Ich nahm als Beispiel die Synphonie von Mozart oder Haydn, zu der Emme immer den Text singt: "Alle Kätzle sind noch blind, wenn sie erst drei Tag alt sind. Wenn sie aber älter sind, sind die Kätzle nicht mehr blind." Es zeigte sich aber, dass der Musikwissenschaftler dieses Volkslied nicht kannte, sodass ich in Zweifel kam, ob es überhaupt ein Volkslied sei, oder ob es sich nur um eine volksliedartige Interpretation dieser Synphonie mit einem erfundenen volksliedartigen Text handele. Im weiteren Verlauf des Gesprächs, das nun wie eine Art Vorlesung war, die ich hielt, zeigte sich, dass es eigentlich vier verschiedene Katzen sind, die da nacheinander durch diese Liedstrophen dargestellt sind, oder die sie singen. Ich beschäftigte mich nun mit den Übergängen, wo das Lied der einen Katze aufhört und das der nächsten beginnt, und versuchte, zu zeigen, dass man diese Übergänge als Trennungen hören kann - Ende des einen und danach Anfang des anderen Gesanges - aber auch als eigene Einheiten, wo dann der Unterschied zwischen den vier verschiedenen Katzen sich verwischt. Nach dem Erwachen brauchte es einige Momente, bis ich überhaupt begriff, dass ich das geträumt habe. (211 words)

Als ich es mit der Lupe betrachtete, sah ich, dass es ein Schild mit der Aufschrift einer römischen Legion war., das die Figur in der Hand gehalten hatte. Es war die Figur eines römischen Legionärs. Man konnte ihr das Schild wieder in die Hand stecken und ich überlegte noch, ob man es irgendwie befestigen sollte, damit es nich hinausfiele. (136 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3123 (1994-04-08, 04:00 - Zürich)Ich ging mit Belli und der Familie durch die Gassen einer alten Stadt, die ich kannte, die aber teilweise im Zuge einer Renovation verändert war, wobei man wohl den älteren Zustand wiederhergestellt hatte. Zuerst waren wir auch mit einem Auto gefahren, das wohl Eber gesteuert hatte, dann waren wir in einer Fussgängerzone und mussten zu Fuss gehen. In einer Seitenstrasse war ein hölzernes Podium aufgebaut, wo irgendetwas geschehen oder vorgeführt werden sollte. Ich ging mit Belli dahin,. die noch eher ein Kind war. Dann ging Belli nocheinmal raus, wohl um etwas zu holen. Das Podium, auf dem viele Leute wartend sassen, setzte sich in Bewegung und wurde immer schneller. Ich sass neben einer Frau und einem Kind. Belli war noch nicht zurückgekommen. Das Fahrzeug wurde immer schneller. Es machte eine Art Aussichtsfahrt durch die Stadt. Dann glitt es ins Wasser und fuhr jetzt eine Zeit lang auf einem Kanal. Nach einer Weile war wieder Boden unter den Füssen und es fuhr jetzt mit immer zunehmender Geschwindigkeit durch die Gassen und tunnelartige Gewölbe, so schnell, dass man sich festhalten musste. Irgendwann wurde es wieder langsamer. Man sah in Räume, die als Gastwirtschaft zurecht gemacht waren. Die Plattform hatte angehalten und man musste zu Fuss weitergehen. Ich hatte das Gefühl, das wir wieder in der Gegend des Ausgangs der Reise angekommen waren. Ich hörte Emmes Stimme, die mit irgendjemand redete und rief: "Emme!". Sie antwortete eher beiläufig, wie jemand, der in ein Gespräch vertieft ist, "Ja", und ich ging der Stimme nach, wofür ich eine Treppe herabsteigen musste. Offenbar war sie in der unteren Etage. Ich hörte dort wieder ihre Stimme und rief noch mal "Emme", um sie zu finden. Sie antwortete, immer noch ins Gespräch vertieft, scherzhaft "Nein", statt "Ja". Ich ging weiter der Stimme nach, die jetzt schon ganz nah war, und erwachte, Emmes Schlafgeräusche neben mir hörend. (308 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3124 (1994-04-08, 06:00 - Zürich)Zu Gast im Kremel. Ich sitze mit meinem Gastgeber beim Nachmittagskaffee. Ich giesse aus einem grossen Milchtopf Milch in meinen Kaffee und bemerke danach, dass der Topf jetzt so gut wie ganz leer ist, aber noch eine Kaffeetasse dasteht, die dem Chef des Hauses, einem Fürst oder dem Staatschef, gebracht werden soll und in die noch keine Milch gegossen ist. Ich zeige meinem Gastgeber den leeren Topf und sage: "Es tut mir leid". Er steht auf, um weitere Milch zu suchen und klingelt, als er keine findet, dem Diener, scheint aber dann doch noch welche zu entdecken, und sagt: "Hier scheint die Lösung für unser Problem zu sein". Der Gastgeber macht einerseits einen aristokratischen Eindruck, andererseits wirkt er wie ein Gelehrter, etwa wie Gadamer. Es ist ein vornehme höfische Atmosphäre in dem Raum. (133 words)

Das fragte eine unsympatische Krankengymnastin, die sich zu einer Art Kontrollinstanz an diesem Ort aufgeschwungen hatte, sicher, ohne dazu berechtigt zu sein. Es war ein Ort, wo ich schon oft zur Behandlung der Schmerzen in Hals und Nacken hingegangen war, den ich aber vorher noch nie als Moorbad bezeichnet gehört hatte. Ich liess den Hals und Nacken dort massieren. Ich ärgerte mich über ihren Ton und erwachte bei der Überlegung, wie ich ihr antworten sollte. Vorhergegangen waren andere Traumszenen mehr erotischen Inhalts, die ich weitgehend vergessen habe. Ein Mädchen spielte darin einen Rolle, das den Rock aufschlug und nichts darunter trug.

Erst hinterher fiel mir ein, dass die Fakultät ja beschlossen hat, dass man nach dem Rücktritt nur solche Doktorarbeiten noch betreuen darf, die vor dem Rücktritt schon begonnen oder verabredet waren. Ich war nun im Dilemma ob ich dies den Leuten sagen sollte, oder hoffen, dass es niemand merken würde. Es war mir aber klar, dass es eigentlich zu viel für mich sein würde, da ich ja nicht mehr die helfende Infrastruktur des Instituts zur Verfügung habe. Schliesslich war ich froh, als mir nach dem Erwachen allmählich klar wurde, dass das Ganze ja nur geträumt war. (113 words)

Ich suche sehr sorgfältig den Boden, der mit einem weissen flauschigen Teppich bedeckt ist, dort, wo sie steht, ab, ohne etwas zu finden, und dehne dann die Suche auf einen immer grösseren Raum aus. Es ist ein langer Gang in einer Wohnung. Schliesslich findet ein Student, der neben mir geht, ganz am Ende des Ganges die Kugel. Während ich sie dort intensiv suchend nicht gesehen habe, findet er sie gleichsam beiläufig mir einem Blick. Ich bringe sie Tina, die sehr erlöst ist, den Verschluss wieder zu haben.

Nun fragte mich aber die Sekretärin des Psychologischen Instituts, die auch damit zu tun hatte, ob wir nicht in dieser Zeit alle Kinder hüten könnten, die von Bille und Tina und auch noch die von anderen Gästen. Ich hatte den Eindruck hatte, dass sie das eigenmächtig fragte und wohl vor allem besorgt war, dass sonst sie all die mitgebrachten Kinder im Institut hüten müsse, wo das Fest anscheinend stattfinden sollte. Es war mir klar, dass das Hüten so vieler Kinder gleichzeitig in unserer nicht darauf eingerichteten Wohnung nicht möglich wäre. (106 words)

Nun möchte sie auch noch promovieren. Ich sage: "Man müsste sie ausserhalb der Prüfungssituation kennen, um zu sehen, ob sie nur in der Prüfung so hysterisch ist. Ruth rät mir ab, weil sie sie offenbar auch ausserhalb der Prüfungssituation kennt. Während des ganzen Gesprächs schiebe ich Ruths Fahrrad, auf dem sie sitzt, und hebe es spielerisch dabei über Wegschwellen, die aber allmählich höher werden. Die letzte Schwelle ist so hoch, dass ich sie zwar noch mit dem Fahrrad rüberheben, aber nicht gleichzeitig auch noch selbst die Schwelle überklettern kann, sodass ich sie deshalb mit dem Fahrrad dort erst hinlegen muss, ehe ich selbst mich mit Mühe über die Schwelle ziehen kann. Wir lachen darüber. Bei dem Schwellenüberklettern erwache ich mit Herzklopfen. Das Gespräch hatte dabei die Wendung genommen, dass ich sie fragte, ob sie die Studentin auch ausserhalb der Prüfungssituation kenne, und sie antwortete: "Nicht persönlich, aber der Hauswart namens Böhm". Das war - im Traum- ein selber etwas schwieriger Hauswart, dessen Urteil aber ernst zu nehmen war. Im Wachen kenne ich diesen Hauswart nicht und es gibt ihn nicht. (204 words)

So bemerke ich vor der Tür des Käfigs noch ein zweites Bett, das man auf die Dachschräge gesetzt und dann ein Dach so darüber gezogen hat, dass man es zunächst garnicht merkt. Ich lege mich darauf und finde es sehr gemütlich. Wenn man die Hand über den Bettrand ausstreckt, langt man nach unten und berührt die Dachziegel des Daches, das steil nach unten abfällt. Das ist mir dann doch etwas unheimlich, obwohl das Bett solide darauf befestigt zu sein scheint, und ich stehe wieder auf. Wir können das ganze Speichergebiet als Wohnung mieten. Erst bei genauer Betrachtung bemerkt man die geniale Inmprovisiertheit des Ganzen, die ebenso harmonisch gestaltet ist wie der Käfig selber, den Herr von Kügelgen gemacht hat. Ich bin gerührt bei der Vorstellung, so lange darin gewohnt zu haben, und vertiefe mich in der Vorstellung in die Raumverhältnisse. (173 words)

Als Beweis dafür zeigte er mir auch gleich den Text, von dem er abgeschrieben hatte, und seine Klausur, die zumindest hier eine wörtliche Abschrift war. Es war klar, dass ich die Klausur so nicht annehmen konnte. Er hatte mir aber auch nicht betrügerisch eine abgeschriebene Sache als seine eigene abgegeben, sondern diesen Versuch abgebrochen. Ich überlegte, ob ich nicht in diesem Fall sagen sollte, dass er die Klausur abgebrochen habe. Er musste die Prüfung dann beim nächsten Termin wiederholen, stand aber nicht als Betrüger da. Ich überlegte auch, ob es möglich sei, ihn nochmal neu anfangen zu lassen, aber dazu war die Zeit wohl schon zu knapp. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwachte ich. (131 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3139 (1994-04-16, 02:30 - Zürich)Ich war mit Emme in einer wundervollen Ausstellung im Freien, die eigentlich Feuer, Wasser, Luft und Erde inszenierte. Wasserfälle rauschten und Feuer brannten, deren Rauch geheimnisvolle Schatten warf, durch die die Sonne zwischen den Bäumen hindurchschien. Wir waren lange Zeit dort und vertieften uns in das Ganze, das sich im Sonnenlicht und dem Schattenspiel zwischen den Bäumen ständig wandelte und immer andere Ausblicke in die Landschaft zuliess. An einer Bergwand hatte man geheimnisvolle bilderartige Spiele inszeniert, die Stadien der menschlichen Geschichte zeigten. Mir fiel ein, dass in einer Kritik, die ich in der Zeitung über die Ausstellung gelesen hatte, vor allem diese Szenen beschrieben waren, und jemand sagte, dass in London und New York und an anderen Orten, wo diese Ausstellung auch schon gezeigt war, überall diese historischen Szenen an den Eingang gesetzt worden waren, so dass sie einen beherrschenden Charakter bekamen, während in der hiesigen Ausstellung die zauberhaften Naturschauspiele und das Elementare den wichtigsten Platz hatten. Wir genossen das Ganze sehr und es erfüllte mich noch nach dem Erwachen eine Weile, bis mir klar wurde, dass das Ganze ja ein Traum gewesen war. Es war sozusagen noch räumlich da, als ob man noch dazwischen wäre. (196 words)

Er nannte das, einen Brief von ihnen bekommen. Während ich das Phänomen noch betrachtete, hiess es : "Jetzt kommt ein Brief von Jesus Christus", etwa so, wie man sagt: "Auf der anderen Leitung kommt ein Anruf von Sowieso rein", wenn jemand zwei Telephone hat und gerade mit jemand telephoniert, während auf der anderen Telephonleitung ein Anruf von Sowieso kommt. Mir schien das nun doch etwas viel und unheimlich. Man sah, wie sich das Bild, oder die Umrisse eines Gesichts auf dem Bildschirm irgendwie änderte und konkretisierte. Ich wunderte mich über die Naivität und Begeisterung, mit der der Mann den Brief oder Anruf, eigentlich die Gegenwart der Person der Gottheit hinnahm.

Es waren alle Grade der Heftigkeit und Sanftheit in den Umarmungen, die irgendwie gefilmt wurden, und ich sollte nun die ideale Form herausfinden. Dabei ergab sich durch einen Zufall, dass die schönste Form eine Mischung von sanft und heftig war, denn durch Zufall gerieten Beispiele zusammen, wo die erste Hälfte aus der einen, die andere aus der anderen Art stammte, sodass also der Anfang aus einer sehr heftigen und die andere Hälfte aus einer sehr sanften Umarmung stammte oder umgekehrt. Dabei gab es fliessende Übergänge (103 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3142 (1994-04-19, 04:30 - Zürich)Verschiedene Traumszenen. In einer war das Schuhband gerissen oder fehlte ganz in beiden Stiefeln. Ich fand kein Schuhband aber schliesslich ein anderes Band, das durch die Ösen passte. Ich musste es auf beide Stiefel aufteilen. Es war dann in beiden zu kurz, liess sich aber gerade noch so schliessen, das die Teile der Stiefel zu waren, die unter den Hosen herauskuckten. Dann waren die Batterien der Kamera alle und ich hatte keine Ersatzbatterien, fand aber schliesslich kleine Akus, die die selbe Spannung erzeugten und in das Batteriefach passten. Es ging auch, aber jemand sagte, es sei vielleicht gefährlich für das Essen. Er stellte sich wohl vor, dass von den Akus chemische Wirkungen auf das gleichzeitig von uns gegessene Essen ausgehen würden. Dann waren Schlips und Kragen so miteinander verdreht, dass ich sie nicht zurechtziehen konnte, sondern Schlips und Hemdkragen öffnen und alles neu binden musste. Dafür ging ich in eine Toilette, deren Tür sich aber nicht abschliessen liess. Ich konnte sie aber dadurch schliessen, das ich mich von innen an sie lehnte. Dann kamen auch noch kiechernde Mädchen in die Toilette. obwohl es eine Herrentoilette war. Ich dachte zuerst, ich sei in die Damentoilette geraten, merkte aber dann, dass das nicht stimmte. Ich hatte meinen Mantel ausziehen müssen, um an den Schlips heranzukommen, und hatte keinen Haken gefunden, um ihn anzuhängen. Darum hatte ich ihn auf den Boden gelegt. Ich schob ihn mit dem Fuss zur Seite, damit die kiechernden Mädchen ihn nicht in ihr Abteil ziehen konnten, was ihnen durchaus zuzutrauen war. Dann musste ich in der nächsten Traumszene eine Rechnung für ein Essen bezahlen, das wir im Baur au Lac gegeben hatten. Ich hatte erwartet, dass sie sehr hoch sein würde. Das war sie auch. Es kostete 1870 Mark. Der Kellner, der mir den Betrag sagen musste und ihn wohl auch sehr hoch fand, sagte zuerst im Scherz 18 Millionen, um mich auf die Höhe vorzubereiten, die dann gegenüber den 18 Millionen ja noch gering erschien. Ich hatte nicht genügend Bargeld da, fand aber einen Check, der genügend Geld enthielt, und überlegte nun, wieviel Trinkgeld ich geben solle. Bei dieser Überlegung wachte ich auf und war doch sehr erleichtert, als ich nach dem Erwachen realisierte, dass es nur ein Traum war und ich nicht wirklich ein so teures Essen bezahlen musste.

Wir führten sehr schöne Gespräche und es war sehr harmonisch. Auf dem Heimweg in der Gegend der Kantonsschulstrasse und des Florhofs hier in Zürich musste ich an Gisela denken. Ich sah sie in Holzschuhen oder Holzsandalen durch die sommerliche Landschaft laufen, etwa in dem Alter, das sie damals, 1950, hatte. Ich bekam Sehnsucht nach ihr und beschloss, sie anzurufen.

Das sagte eine Frau, die älter war als ich, wohl eine Verwandte aber wohl auch jemand in einer Rolle wie ein Lehrer. Es handelte sich um ein Stipendium, das ich vor längerem beantragt hatte. Es ging um eine Arbeit über Handschriften aus einem früheren Jahrhundert aus der Gotik, wohl um Schriften von Menschen aus dem dreizehnten und vierzehnten Jahrhundert. Sie erklärte dann, dass die Kritik des Referenten, der das Stipendiengesuch bearbeiten musste, sich auf die Auswahl der Personen bezog, weil auch viele Verbrecher und fragwürdige Personen darunter waren. Ich sagte spontan: "Schriften sind eben nicht nur von erfolgreichen und angesehenen Leuten interessant, sondern es können auch die Schriften von Verbrechern und Aussenseitern interessant sein." Sie sagte erfreut: "Genau das habe ich auch gedacht" Ich hatte die Schriften aus einem noch sehr viel grösseren Haufen von Schriften ausgesucht, den man mir dafür zur Verfügung gestellt hatte, und ich hatte sie blind ausgesucht, das heisst ohne Kenntnis, wer die Schrifturheber waren, und nur unter dem Gesichtspunkt, dass die Schriften interessant sein sollten. Nun musste ich also das noch mal begründen, was an sich leicht ging, aber wieder ein längeres Warten bedingte. Die Frau sagte noch, dass ihre Mutter den Referenten, offenbar einen älteren Gelehrten, gut kenne und mit ihm reden könne, denn er sei noch bis zum Soundsovielsten Referent. Ich ärgerte mich über diese Umstände und dachte, dass ich so etwas ja eigentlich nicht mehr nötig habe, wachte bei der Überlegung auf, ob ich nicht lieber auf das Stipendium verzichten solle, das doch offenbar schon vor Jahren beantragt war, und war dann nach dem Erwachen froh, als ich merkte, dass das Ganze ja nur geträumt war und ich also nicht wirklich eine solche Arbeit, die ich sinnlos fand, ausführen musste.

Da der Platz sehr knapp war, blieb nichts anderes übrig, als dies alles übereinander zu stapeln. Ich tat die Tischplatten zu unterst, die wertvollen Gemälde obenauf. Als die Tischplatten gebraucht wurden und ich sie unten rausziehen musste, wurde mir klar, wie sehr die Gemälde gefährdet waren, wenn jemand die Tischplatten nicht gleichmässig und vorsichtig rausziehen und reinschieben würde, und dass ich das nicht garantieren konnte, weil nicht nur ich allein in den Raum kam, sondern auch andere. Irgendwo standen auch relativ teure Radio- und Plattenabspielapparate. Jemand fragte nach dem Namen des einen und sagte: "Ist das nicht ein Sowieso?" Ich wusste es nicht, und er sagte, es würde einen guten Eindruck machen, wenn ich solche Dinge wüsste, er meinte einen guten Eindruck auf die Oberen. Er wusste offenbar nicht, dass ich selber zu diesen gehörte, was mich ärgerte. Ich wachte auf mit den Sorgen über die gestapelten Gemälde. (174 words)

Gleichzeitig ist es aber auch eine Vorlesung über den Traum, die ich halte und in der dieser Traum als Beispiel dient. Es gibt eine Menge Assoziationen und Zusammenhänge zur philosophischen Frage "Was ist eigentlich Pelz?", die ich darstelle, wobei die Sache immer vielschichtiger wird, weil diese Frage von verschiedenen Philosophen behandelt worden ist. Dabei wird deutlich, wie sehr dieser Traum, dessen Einzelheiten ich jetzt vergessen habe, im Grunde diese philosophischen Fragen und Ideen bildlich darstellt. Am Schluss dieser Vorlesung sage ich zu den Zuhörern: "Jetzt will ich Ihnen den Traumtext noch einmal vorlesen. Dann wird der Zusammenhang mit all den philosophischen Fragen und Texten, die wir behandelt haben, deutlich werden. Zugleich wird dann erst die eigentliche Deutung des Traumes beginnen und zeigen, wie der Traum alle diese Fragen variiert."

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3156 (1994-04-29, 05:45 - Zürich)Ich war in der Universität und sah dort einen neuen Professor, der ein netter junger Mann zu sein schien. Er war mit einigen anderen Psychologieprofessoren zusammen in einem Raum, wo sie Verschiedenes erledigten und besprachen. Ich sagte, dass ich froh sei, diese Dinge nicht mehr behandeln zu müssen, und ging dann mich verabschiedend in den Nebenraum, vorher noch zu dem neuen Professor sagend, dass ich hoffe, dass es sich in meinem ehemaligen kleinen Zimmer oben wohl fühlen werde, in dem ich auch geschlafen habe. Als ich in den leeren Nebenraum kam, schoss dort ein fingerdicker Wasserstrahl aus der Decke. Der Strahl hatte einen kräftigen Druck, sodass er diagonal durch das ganze Zimmer von der Decke zur Tür ging. Er kam kurz unter dem Beginn der Dachschräge aus der Seitenwand. Es musste wohl ein Rohrbruch sein. Ich lief schnell zurück zum Nebenzimmer, um die anderen zu alarmieren. Es war aber drinnen so laut, dass sie mein Klopfen nicht hörten. Ich öffnete die Tür und sah, dass sie in einem Nebenraum waren, dessen Tür ich ebenfalls öffnete, als sie auch dort mein Klopfen nicht hörten. Der Lärm kam von einem Art Maschinengeräusch und ich rief laut: "Drüben kommt ein fingerdicker Wasserstrahl aus der Decke geschossen" und zog einen Kollegen heraus. Er kam sofort in das Nebenzimmer, wo in diesem Moment der Wasserstrahl ausgesetzt hatte. Dann aber begann der Strahl wieder und traf ihn, der gerade an dieser Stelle stand. Er fand auch, dass man sofort etwas machen müsste, und ich erwachte. (249 words)

Sie: "Mit einem einzigen ganz langen Nagel, der ganz tief hineingeht." Der sehr schmale hohe Absatz verbreiterte sich unten an der Spitze etwas und gerade das war das abgebrochene Stück. Ich sagte: "Es muss doch beim Tritt einen grossen Druck aushalten" Sie antwortete, dass es eben erstaunlich gut gehalten habe. (93 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3159 (1994-05-02, 04:30 - Zürich)Ich war Komponist und hatte ein neues Musikstück komponiert. Es wurde in der Uni aufgeführt. Dort hatte ich auch ein Schliessfach, in dem alle meine Sachen drin waren, so dass ich mich um nichts kümmern musste. Auch das Musikstück wurde von einem Gerät aus aufgeführt, das man mit dem Schlüssel bedienen konnte. Es wurde offenbar von einem Tonband oder ähnlichem gespielt. Vorher eine andere Szene, wo ich ein Referat hielt auf einer Tagung oder einem Kongress. Am Schluss des Traums, war ich an einem See, wo ich den Umgang mit einem Boot lernte. Ein Mann, der wohl eine Art Fährmann war, fuhr mit einem Boot, das er am Ufer durch einen Fusstritt in Gang setzte, ganz mühelos ans andere Ufer, wo er sein Ruder liegen hatte. Er war so geübt, dass er es nicht brauchte, sondern das Boot beim Abstossen so genau in die richtige Richtung lenken konnte, dass er genau an der Stelle des gegenüberliegenden Ufers ankam, wo sein Ruder lag. Der See war hier nur so breit wie ein grosser Fluss. (173 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3160 (1994-05-03, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich verlor von einem Auto ein Rad, das nun neben einer schnurgeraden Strasse entlangrollte in ziemlich hoher Geschwindigkeit, ohne zu wanken. Am Ende der Strasse prallte es an eine quer zur Strasse verlaufende Mauer, lief ein Stück zurück und kehrte dann um, um nach kurzer Zeit wieder an die Mauer zu prallen. Dieser Vorgang wiederholte sich von da an rhythmisch und ich hatte Sorge, dass es dort auf einer die Mauer entlang laufenden Strasse zu Unfällen führen könnte, bemerkte aber, als ich schliesslich selbst diese Mauer erreichte, dass dort keine Querstrasse war. Der Reifen war gross und breit, wie bei einem Lastauto. Vorher eine andere Szene, wo ein italienischer Satz eine Rolle spielte, den ich aber vergessen habe. Ich weiss nur noch, dass er sprachliche Auffälligkeiten enthielt (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3162 (1994-05-04, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich bereite eine Vorlesung vor und schreibe dafür ein Vorlesungsmanuskript. Es handelt von einem Philosophen. In der Etage unter mir sitzt Hannes Fehr und ich übertrage ihm das Manuskript durch eine Videoanlage. Er ist begierig, das nächste Blatt zu sehen, während ich noch damit beschäftigt bin, die Heftklammern zu lösen, die zwei Blätter miteinander verbinden. Ich sage darum, wohl durch eine Wechselsprechanlage, zu ihm, dass er sich einen Augenblick gedulden muss, weil sonst die Heftkalmmern in mein Bett fallen. Offenbar bereite ich die Vorlesung im Bett vor. Hier ist die Erinnerung nicht ganz deutlich. (94 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3163 (1994-05-05, 03:30 - Zürich)Ich war bei einem Kongress oder einer Tagung, wo über verschiedene Therapieformen diskutiert und diese miteinander verglichen und zueinander in Beziehung gesetzt wurden. Das Treffen fand in einem Haus mit ineinander übergehenden Räumen in verschiedenen Etagen statt, wo man mit Decken und Kissen auf dem Fussboden lagerte. Die Decken und Kissen lagen zu diesem Zweck an verschiedenen Stellen bereit. Ich ging mit jemand die Treppe rauf, der sich an einer Stelle solche Decken und Kissen nahm. Ich wollte ihn zu einem noch etwas weiter gelegenen Raum führen, den ich besonders gemütlich fand. (92 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3164 (1994-05-06, 05:45 - Zürich)In einem Eisenbahn- oder Strassenbahnwagen war am Fenster eine Art Schnapprollo aus durchscheinendem beigen Stoff, wie man es zum Schutz gegen Sonne rauf und runter ziehen kann. An seinem Ende war eine Stange, die rechts und links in Schienen lief, in denen sie aber klemmte und sich nicht mehr richtig bewegen liess. Ausserdem funktionierte die Feder, die es hoch ziehen sollte, nicht mehr richtig, sodass es in geschlossenem Zustand klemmte und fest sass. Andere Szene: Ich war beim Aufräumen und hatte begonnen, lauter kleine Gegenstände, Bürosachen und ähnliches, die sich angesammelt hatten, in zwei Haufen zu legen, solche die weggeworfen werden sollten, und solche, die ich aufheben wollte. Ich merkte bald, dass ich in der Mitte einen dritten Haufen machen musste von solchen, wo es schwer zu entscheiden war, darunter waren zum Beispiel lauter alte Füllfederhalter, mit denen die Erinnerung an viel Geschriebenes und die Situation des Schreibens verbunden war. Es war mir klar, dass ich aufpassen musste, dass dieser mittlere Haufen des Unentschiedenen nicht zu gross wurde. Um die Haufen zu bilden, brauchte ich Platz. Darum breitete ich sie auf dem Fussboden aus. Emme, die hinzukam, sagte anklagend, dass ich jetzt auch noch den Rest der Wohnung mit Unordnung bedecke. Ich war über dieses Missverständnis sehr beleidigt und verzweifelt und klagte laut darüber. Emme begann dann, mich zu trösten. (220 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3165 (1994-05-07, 03:00 - Zürich)Ich fuhr in der Strassenbahn. Ich war gerade am Pfauen umgestiegen und jetzt auf dem Weg zur Universität, als ein Kontrolleur kam. Ich hatte ein Billet bei mir, das entwertet werden musste. Es war aber noch niemand gekommen, der das konnte. Also holte ich es hervor und wollte zu ihm sagen: "Ich möchte Sie bitten, dieses Billet zu entwerten", wobei mir klar wurde, dass er vielleicht merken könnte, dass ich ja die vorherige Strecke bis zum Pfauen auch schon mit nicht entwerteter Fahrkarte gefahren war. Aber vielleicht würde er das ja nicht merken. Als ich anfing, zu reden, begrüsste er mich aber freundlich und sagte :"Ah, Herr von Uslar". Er hatte früher schon mal etwas für mich erledigt und sogar nach Hause geschickt und fragte nun, ob er gut angekommen sei. Die Stadt habe es für ihn erledigt. Ich sagte: "Ja, die haben es ganz reizend mitten in der Nacht geschickt und auf dem dunklen Dachboden in die richtige Tasche dafür gesteckt". Die Leute, die mich irgendwie kannten, hatten nämlich wirklich im dunklen nächtlichen Haus den Weg auf den Dachboden gefunden, wo die Fahrkarte aus irgendeinem Grunde hingehörte und wo ich sie am nächsten Morgen gefunden hatte. Während der Mann noch redete, hatte ich jetzt meinen Halbtaxausweis hervorgeholt, den man auch brauchte, und er hatte einen Blick darauf geworfen. Im Erwachen wurde mir noch klar, dass der Ausweis ja auch eine im Stadtgebiet gültige Regenbogenkarte enthielt, sodass ich den zusätzlichen Fahrschein eigentlich sowieso garnicht gebraucht hätte.

Ich hatte extra deshalb meinen freien Tag von diesem heutigen Samstag auf den folgenden Sonntag verschoben. Nun rief im letzten Moment die Sekretärin meines Bruders an und sagte, er könne heute nicht und werde erst am nächsten Tag kommen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3169 (1994-05-10, 05:45 - Zürich)Ich wollte mit Dieter Sträuli irgendwo hin fahren in einem Auto, das ich zur Verfügung hatte und in dem ich neu fahren gelernt hatte. Vorher musste ich aber noch eine Reihe von Sachen erledigen, und er wollte solange im Auto sitzen bleiben und lesen. Die Sachen, die ich zu erledigen hatte, zogen sich aber sehr in die Länge. Darunter war auch ein Abendessen an einem grossen Tisch wie in Wittmoldt, und Frau von Bülow war die Dane des Hauses, bei der ich mich noch entschuldigen wollte, weil ich früher vom Tisch aufstand. Es brachen aber im selben Moment auch verschiedene andere schon auf, sodass es nicht nötig war, extra etwas zu ihr zu sagen. Ich hatte auch zwei bunte Plastikbeutel bei mir, die denen glichen die man bei der indischen Ausstellung im Globus bekam und auf denen rote Elephanten auf blauem Grund zu sehen sind. Ich musste sie noch nach oben in die Wohnung bringen - wir wohnten irgendwo in einem oberen Stock.-. Ich wollte aber vorher noch am Auto vorbeigehen und Dieter Sträuli Bescheid sagen, weil er schon so lange hatte warten müssen. Unterwegs begegnete mir Emme, die etwas erledigte und so damit beschäftigt war, dass sie meine Rede im Vorbeigehen nicht richtig verstand, was aber auch nicht nötig war, weil es nichts Wesentliches war. Auf dem Wege zum Auto überlegte ich mir, dass Dieter Sträuli vielleicht inzwischen gegangen sein könnte, weil es ihm zu lange gedauert hätte. In diesem Fall würde er wohl einen Zettel im Auto gelassen haben. Ich dachte bei mir, dass das vielleicht auch nicht schlecht wäre, weil es schon so spät geworden war und ich ihn dann nach unserem Ausflug, der wohl etwa in Richtung Winterthur führen sollte, auch noch in die Stadt nach Hause bringen musste, denn wir wohnten etwas ausserhalb der Stadt. Auf dem Wege zum Auto erwachte ich. (307 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3170 (1994-05-11, 05:45 - Zürich)Ich hatte eine Reihe kleiner Instrumente, in der Grösse etwa wie Schraubenzieher, ausgeliehen und wollte sie zurückgeben. Der Besitzer kam, um sie zu holen. Sie mussten im Mittelzimmer bei den Computern sein und ich führte ihn dorthin, vorbei an dem aufgebauten Kartonstapel der Aufräumsachen. Die Computertastatur und andere Instrumente waren mit einer Decke zugedeckt. Darunter auch ein kleines schachtelartiges Gerät, wohl eine Art Transformator, das am Computer angeschlossen war. Der Computer begann zu laufen, ohne dass ich ihn angeschaltet hatte. Es musste an dem Gerät liegen und ich schüttelte es unter der Decke, weil ich die Erfahrung gemacht hatte, dass man den Computer so wieder ausschalten konnte. Das gelang aber nicht, oder nur vorübergehend. Ich konnte auch die zurückzugebenden Instrumente nicht finden und erwachte mit dem Gefühl des Frustriertseins, wollte auch zunächst den Traum garnicht aufschreiben und hatte Mühe, zu begreifen, dass es ja ein richtiger Traum gewesen war.

Sie waren anscheinend die Erreger einer gefährlichen Krankheit, wie jemand sagte, und kamen aus den Ritzen hervor. Ich hatte das erste Exemplar entdeckt und suchte nun alle Ritzen um mich herum ab, um weitere zu entfernen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3172 (1994-05-12, 07:00 - Zürich)Ich war bei einer Gesellschaft in einem Haus, in dem in mehreren Räumen die Feier oder Party stattfand und viele Menschen beisammen waren. Als ich gehen wollte, ging ich in einen Raum, in dem viele Mäntel hingen aber auch feiernde Leute beisammen waren. Dann fiel mir ein, dass ich meinen Mantel nicht dort sondern schon in einer Garderobe beim Eingang des Hauses aufgehängt hatte. Um keine Unruhe zu erzeugen, ging ich, ohne mich extra zu verabschieden, dort hin. Nun bemerkte ich, dass ich ausser dem Mantel auch meine beiden grossen blauen Liberty-Wachstuchtaschen dort gelassen hatte, in denen ich allerlei Sachen transportierte. In den Taschen fand ich auch einen Stapel Photographien, die ich hatte abziehen lassen, darunter auch ein Bild, das Emmi darstellte. Als ich es betrachtete, klebte es an der Hand fest und als ich diese wegzog, blieb eine Teil der Bildschicht daran hängen. Ich konnte diesen mit den Fingern der anderen Hand von meinem Daumen abziehen, an dem er klebte, und sah, dass der abgelöste Bildteil, der Kopf, Gesicht und Hals enthielt, noch als Ganzes beisammen war und sich in die entstandene Lücke auf dem Bild wieder einfügen liess. Als ich versuchte, ihn dort wieder anzudrücken, blieb aber nun ein viel grösserer Teil der Bildfläche an der Hand hängen und liess sich nicht mehr zusammenhängend abziehen. In diesem Moment kam ein befreundeter Arzt oder Medizinprofessor hinzu, der ganz selbstverständlich, fast reflektorisch, meine Hand hielt, während ich den zusammenhängenden Teil der Bildschicht davon abzuziehen versuchte, wobei er sozusagen in die Gegenrichtung an der Hand zog, um das Abziehen zu erleichtern, was er sehr geschickt und in einer beruhigenden Weise tat. Ich sagte, wie man hier die Gewohnheit und Übung des Arztes bemerke. Wir meinten beide, dass es nicht schlimm sei, da man ja ganz leicht neue Abzüge machen konnte. Dann, in einer anderen Szene, hatte ich ein flaches schalenartiges Metallgefäss vom Flohmarkt in der Hand, dessen innere Oberfläche mit einer weissen hautartigen Lackschicht überzogen war. Ich bemerkte darauf einen Fleck und versuchte, ihn abzukratzen. Dabei bildete sich aber in der alten Lackschicht ein Loch und das Metall des Gefässes schaute dort heraus. Dann bemerkte ich, dass auch viele andere Partien der Lackschicht locker waren und sich abziehen liessen, gleichsam Blasen geworfen hatten, wie es manchmal bei altem Lack auf Metallgefässen vom Flohmarkt geschieht. Ich zog gedankenverloren einige Teile der Schicht ab, merkte aber dann, dass andere noch fester an der Metallfläche hielten und nur mit einer Bürste zu entfernen waren. Ich beschloss darum, das zu Hause zu machen, und steckte das Gefäss wieder in einen Plastikbeutel, wobei ich die abgezogenen Teile der Lackschicht darin liegen liess, da ich keinen Ort in der Garderobe fand, wo ich sie hintun konnte. Dann bin ich allmählich aufgewacht. (454 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3173 (1994-05-13, 07:00 - Zürich)Ich telephonierte mit einem Geschäft in München, um einen kleinen Spielzeugbären zu bestellen, den es offenbar nur dort gab. Das Gespräch wurde aber unterbrochen und ich legte den Hörer auf. Ich war allein in der Wohnung, weil Emme in den Garten gegangen war, wo sie den ganzen Tag bleiben wollte. Ich fühlte mich deshalb allein und unglücklich und kam auch mit meinen Sachen nicht zu Rande. Als ich in die Küche ging, sah ich Emme reinkommen. Sie war zurückgekommen, um mich zu überraschen und weil sie mich nicht so lange allein lassen wollte. Ich war glücklich und umarmte sie. (99 words)

Als ich runterkam, sah ich, dass der Schlüssel der Unterbewohnerin darin steckte. Da ich fürchtete, sie würde diesen nachher wieder abziehen und dabei die Tür schliessen, zog ich ihn ab und legte ihn auf die Fensterbank ihrer Küche neben der Kellertür. Dann lief ich rauf, um meinen eigenen Schlüssel zu holen. Da hörte ich die Unterbewohnerin. mit ihrer dunklen Stimme etwas ärgerlich sagen: "Ja, ja, sie läuft ja schon die ganze Zeit" und merkte nun, dass sie ihren Schlüssel auch für die andere Nachbarin hineingesteckt hatte. Dann hörte ich Fderen eilige Schritte, die zu der Tür lief und stutzte, weil sie zu war - ich hatte nämlich beim Abziehen des Schlüssels sozusagen auch reflektorisch die Tür abgeschlossen, die sonst immer zu sein muss. - Sie sagte vor sich hin: "Zwölf bis fünfzehn" und sah offenbar fragend die Tür an. Ich holte ganz schnell meinen Schlüssel und sprang, um ihr das Missverständnis zu erklären, die Stufen zum Keller herab, wobei ich auch über Schneehaufen springen musste. In diesem Moment erwachte ich. (196 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3177 (1994-05-19, 05:45 - Zürich)Traum. Ich war zusammen mit einem jungen Paar durch München geschlendert. Ich hatte die beiden bei einem Konzert, einer Gesellschaft. oder ähnlichem kennen gelernt. Das heisst, zuerst war die Frau mit einem anderen Mann zusammen gewesen und hatte dann diesen Mann hier kennen gelernt. Ich hatte irgendwie im Gespräch den Ausdruck tabula rasa gebraucht, der aber hier eine Tafel meinte, auf die wiederum Neues geschrieben werden kann. Wir waren auf unserem Weg in eine Strasse geraten, die grosszügig in zwei Fahrbahnen mit einem Kanal oder einer Wasseranlage in der Mitte angelegt war. Dieser Kanal war jetzt im Winter leer und man konnte über seinen Boden, der leicht schneebedeckt war, wie eine Strasse gehen, was wir taten. Es war eine elegante Fortbewegungsweise mit leichten Höhenunterschieden wie Kaskaden. Ab und zu musste man über kleine Wasserbänder springen, die den Weg kreuzten. Nach einer Weile sagte die Frau. "O es ist zwölf und gerade ist die letzte Drei weggefahren. Jetzt fahren keine Strassenbahnen mehr." Die Drei war die Linie, die die beiden brauchten. Ich wusste nun nicht, wo in München wir überhaupt waren und wie ich zu meinem Hotel finden sollte. Ich überlegte, dass ich ein Taxi brauchen würde und dass es schwierig sein würde, hier irgendwo in der Stadt in einer Villengegend mitten in der Nacht eines zu finden. Emme war, glaube ich, schon in dem Hotel und ich überlegte, ob sie sich Sorgen machen würde, wenn ich so lange nicht kommen würde. (241 words)

Es sollte auch ein Geburtstag gefeiert und ein neuer Schwiegersohn begrüsst werden. Die Vorbereitungen zogen sich lange hin. So wurden auch Essenzen zusammengestellt, die verdampft werden konnten. Ein junger Mann spielte eine Rolle, der Florian, Claudias Mann, glich. Zuletzt ging es auch um die Vorbereitung einer neuen Bibelübersetzung, die auch illustriert sein sollte und an der ich mitwirken sollte. Als ich fragte, welche Texte zu Grunde gelegt werden sollten, merkte ich dass neben der Lutherübersetzung und anderen guten Übersetzungen auch an solche gedacht wurde, die ich für fragwürdig hielt, weil sie modisch waren und an der Sache vorbeigingen. Der Übergang von der Festvorbereitung zur Bibelübersetzungsvorbereitung war in dem Traum wohl fliessend, so dass ich ihn garnicht als solchen bemerkte. Das tertium comparationis war die Vorbereitung und der Festcharakter. (142 words)

Hier war die Haltestelle wegen einer Baustelle einige Meter vorverlegt, was ich nicht gleich merkte, als der Wagen dort hielt. Als ich noch schnell, ehe er weiter fuhr, aussteigen wollte, merkte ich, dass er auf einer Art Brücke über der Baustellengrube hielt und die Tür durch das Geländer dieser Brücke versperrt war. Ich musste also aus dem Fenster steigen und stand dann auf dem Geländer der Brücke. Meine Papiere hatte ich vorher noch schnell zusammengerafft und an mich genommen. In dem Moment, als die Strassenbahn wieder anfuhr, merkte ich, dass ich meine Schuhe oder Sandalen, aus denen ich während der Fahrt hinausgeschlupft war, in der Bahn hatte stehen lassen und dass ich nun barfuss auf dem Brückengeländer stand. In diesem Moment erwachte ich, dachte aber noch eine Weile darüber nach, wie ich die Schuhe oder Sandalen aus dem Wagen zurückbekommen könne. Neben dem Geländer, auf dem ich stand, war noch etwas, so dass keine Gefahr bestand, in die Grube herabzufallen. Das Problem war bloss, dass ich nun barfuss war. (185 words)

Er gab in dem Brief die Adresse eines Holländers an, über die man ihn erreichen konnte. Er schrieb auch noch in den Brief, dass es nicht nötig sei, den Preis im orientalischen Seminar einzuschreiben.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3186 (1994-05-28, 05:30 - Zürich)Eine Art Wettrennen. Emme trug jemanden auf dem Rücken, der ziemlich gross und schwer war, und musste so ein Stück Weg durch den Raum, in dem wir waren, zurücklegen. Ich bediente die Stoppuhr und sagte auch "Achtung, fertig, los!" am Anfang und "Stopp" am Schluss. Sie kamen wie ein Koloss langsam immer grösser werdend und etwas schwankend auf mich zu. Die Stoppuhr zeigte am Schluss, glaube ich, 3 Minuten und einige Sekunden. Ich konnte es ohne Lesebrille nicht ganz genau lesen. Ich überlegte nun, ob ich das Rennen auch machen sollte. Als Partner kam nur noch Hannes Fehr in Frage, weil nur noch er ausserdem im Raum war. Ich sagte, dann müsse wohl ich der Tragende sein, weil Hannes sehr viel kleiner sei. Emme sagte: "Das Musst Du überlegen". Sie sagte noch in Beziehung auf den Lauf: "Interessant ist, dass nur Eulen Bilder sehen". Ich überlegte die Bedeutung dieses Satzes. Auf einem Gesims entlang der Wegstrecke an der Wand dicht unter der Decke stand eine kleine Eule und auch irgendwelche anderen Sachen, vielleicht auch Bilder. Ich überlegte, ob der Satz so zu hören sei, dass das Wort "dass" mit zwei s geschrieben sei und das Wort "sehen" klein geschrieben, oder aber das Wort "das" mit einem s, und "Sehen" gross geschrieben, als Substantiv, also: "Interessant ist das Nur-Eulenbilder-Sehen". In diesem Fall wäre der den Wettlauf Machende der Sehende und Eulenbilder das Gesehene, im anderen wären die Eulen die Sehenden und Bilder das von ihnen Gesehene. Ich wollte Emme danach fragen und erwachte aber vorher. (254 words)

Ich fragte mich, ob der Hund wohl nach den Vögeln schnappen werde. Er tat es nicht und ein einzelner kleiner Vogel, der zuletzt noch allein auf dem Ast sass, wurde immer frecher und streckte seinen Kopf nach dem Hund aus, der ihn verwundert ankuckte. Der Vogel machte einen immer längeren Hals, sodass er den Hund erreichen konnte, und pickte ihn schliesslich sogar am Kopf. Ich machte mir nun Sorgen, dass der Vogel den Hund vielleicht im Gesicht verletzen könne, und rief nach Emme, um sie zu fragen, was sie meine, und ob ich vielleicht durch in die Hände Klatschen die beiden lieber trennen sollte.

Auch eine Frau Koch kam in dem Traum vor. Die Sätze hatte ich nach dem Erwachen genau in Erinnerung (habe sie aber jetzt bei dieser Rekonstruktion am 9.6.1994 nicht mehr im Gedächtnis.) (53 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3195 (1994-06-05, 04:00 - Zürich)Traum (Zweiter Traum, direkt nach dem ersten) Eine Nachbarin trug ein hochgegürtetes Kleid im Empirestil, dass ihren Busen hochdrückte. Sie wollte das ändern. Ich sagte sie solle es doch so lassen, es sehe sehr hübsch aus. Später merkte ich, dass man wenn man näher an sie herantrat, die Brustwarze des einen Busens im Ausschnitt sehen konnte wie bei einem Renaissancegemälde. Auch das sah sehr schön aus. Ich überlegte, ob ich ihr einen falschen Rat gegeben hätte und sie vielleicht in Verlegenheit kommen könnte, sagte aber doch nichts. (87 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3196 (1994-06-07, 06:00 - Zürich)Im Britischen Museum. Die Klimaanlage wird repariert. Dann war es aber das Schweizer Landesmuseum. Aufseher und ein Direktor sitzen zusammen an einem Tisch. Dann Aufwachen im Traum. Ich versuche nun, den Traum aufzuschreiben, stosse dabei aber auf Schwierigkeiten, habe kein Schreibwerkzeug und Papier. Dann richtiges Erwachen und erneutes Einschlafen. Immer noch bemüht, den Traum aufzuschreiben. Dafür muss ich in einem Aufzug in die Tiefe fahren. In dem Aufzug muss ich die Bedienungsanlage, Lichter und Knöpfe, photographieren. Das gehört zum Traumaufschreiben. Der Auslöser will aber nicht richtig funktionieren. Draussen in der Etage, wo der Aufzug ankommt, sind irgendwie gefährliche Elemente, die in den Aufzug hinein wollen. Ich drücke schnell den Knopf um in eine andere Etage zu fahren. Als der Aufzug dort ankommt, ich bin immer noch mit dem Phtographieren beschäftigt, sind dort dieselben Geräusche der gefährlichen Leute vor der Aufzugtür zu hören und ich erwache nun endgültig.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3197 (1994-06-08, 03:30 - Zürich)Ich war mit einer Studentin zusammen. Auch Dieter Sträuli spielte in dem Traum eine Rolle. Er hatte ein Theaterstück oder Filmstück verfasst, in dem ein Mann immer den jeweils weit möglichsten Abstand von mir halten musste, und hatte es selbst verfilmt. Ich sagte, dass er dazu eine komplizierte und gleichsam aufwendige Regie habe führen müssen, oder sagte das in ähnlichen Worten.Die Studentin hatte irgendetwas gemacht, was ich so empörend fand, dass ich ihr verbot, in meine Vorlesungen zu kommen, was sie akzeptierte, obwohl es sie bedrückte. Dann aber reute es mich, als ich sie traf, und ich nahm es zurück. Wir umarmten uns und legten uns hin, wobei wir wie ein Liebespaar aufeinander lagen. Dann wachte ich auf. (118 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3198 (1994-06-08, 03:45 - Zürich)Mit Emme in einem unterirdischen Gewölbe mit wunderbar harmonischen Formen, das sich spiralförmig in die Tiefe wand. Es war unter einem Haus aus dem sechzehnten Jahrhundert oder der Zeit um 1600. Wir hatten uns zuerst irgendwie in dem Treppenhaus darüber verloren, fanden uns aber dann in dem schneckenförmigen Gewölbe wieder, das sich allmählich nach unten verengte. Das letzte Stück war so eng, dass ich mich darin bedrängt fühlte und sagte: "Das kann ich heute nicht. Es beengt mich zu sehr." Emme, die munter hineingekrochen war, kehrte daraufhin gleich mit mir zusammen um. Es waren auch noch andere Leute in dem Gewölbe, die gleichsam den Atem anhielten, als wir in das enge Schlussstück hineinkriechen wollten. Der freiere Teil des Gewölbegangs war dagegen besonders entspannend durch seine schönen Formen. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3200 (1994-06-09, 06:00 - Zürich)Emme und ich waren in Schwerin in der Cäcilienallee, jetzt Schlossgartenallee, wo wir wohl im Elternhaus wohnten. Vor der Tür am Strassenrand standen riesige Birken, von denen eine gleichsam einen grossen Bogen in der Luft bildete mit einem Zweig, der zum nächsten Baum herüberreichte. Wir waren mit der Pflege dieses Baumes beschäftigt, wo wir wohl einzelne kleine Äste entfernten. Dann gingen wir auf die andere Strassenseite, um den Baum zu bewundern, und traten dann einige Schritte zurück in eine Wiesengegend auf der anderen Seite der Strasse, um die Baumreihe noch besser zu sehen. Dabei sind wir wohl in Gedanken weitergegangen, denn plötzlich waren die Bäume nicht mehr zu sehen und wir wussten nicht recht, wo wir uns befanden. Wir gingen über einen frisch gesäten Rasen zur Strasse zurück, wobei wir auf dem noch weichen Boden unsere Fusstapfen hinterliessen. Wir konnten aber die richtige Stelle der Strasse, wo das Elternhaus stand, nicht wieder finden und wussten nun nicht recht, in welche Richtung wir gehen mussten, um das Haus und die Bäume wieder zu finden. Es war als ob wir uns in die Gegend verirrt hätten, wo die Strasse am See in den Franzosenweg mündet. (193 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3201 (1994-06-10, 01:20 - Zürich)Wir waren zum Einkaufen in einem Warenhaus in London. Wir wollten mit einer Kreditkarte des Zürcher Kaufhauses Jelmoli bezahlen. Das war schon einmal gegangen. Damals hatten wir jemand wie Markus' Vater dabei,.der den Manager des Londoner Warenhauses, einen Herrn im schwarzen Anzug kannte, der die Verkäuferin angewiesen hatte, die Jelmoli-Karte anzuerkennen. Dies sagte ich nun der Verkäuferin auf englisch und sagte ihr, dass es genau an der Stelle und Kasse gewesen sei, wo sie jetzt stände. Markus' Vater bezeichnete ich dabei als Industriellen und als jemand, der mit uns verschwägert sei. Sie sagte, dass wir, Emme und ich, glaubwürdig aussähen und dass sie die Karte akzeptieren werde. Vorher hatten wir noch mit dem Einkaufswagen den Weg von einer anderen Stelle durch eine Art Engpass zwischen Ladentischen zu ihr machen müssen, was aber auch gelungen war. (135 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3203 (1994-06-11, 00:15 - Zürich)Ich bekam von der Bank Post mit Zetteln zu allen Zahlungen, die man monatlich so machen muss, wie Krankenkasse oder ähnliches, und die ausgeführt waren. Bei einer stand das Wort "Rest" und der Betrag war kleiner als alle anderen. Ich machte mir nun Sorgen, dass das bedeute, dass das Geld auf dem Konto alle war und sie mit dem Rest von einer der notwendigen Zahlungen nur einen Teil hatten begleichen können. Plötzlich fiel mir ein: Es war etwas anderes: Ich hatte gute Bekannte oder Verwandte gebeten, ob sie mir etwas leihen könnten, weil ich gerade in einem Engpass stecke. Sie hatten mir nun diesen kleineren Betrag geschickt, weil es der Rest war, den sie gerade noch auf ihrem Konto hatten, weil sie auch gerade in einem Engpass steckten. Ich war sehr gerührt und überlegte, wenn ich wieder Geld bekäme, wofür eine gute Aussicht bestand, sofort einen etwas grösseren Betrag zurück zu schicken und dazu zu schreiben: "Mit Dankeszinsen" oder irgend etwas Ähnliches. Dann wachte ich auf. Vorhergegangen war noch eine andere Szene, wo ich am nächsten Morgen von einem Ferienaufenthalt auf einem Gut bei Bekannten, etwa wie früher in Wittmoldt, zurückfahren wollte, spät am Abend aber bemerkte, dass ich vergessen hatte, mich nach den Zügen zu erkundigen und den Anschlüssen. Ich müsste aber am Morgen schon früh losfahren, da das Gut sehr abgelegen war und ich rechtzeitig in einen Fernzug umsteigen können musste, weil der Weg nach Hause sehr lang war. Jetzt konnte ich keine Auskunft von der Bahn mehr erhalten und morgen so früh auch nicht. Ich überlegte nun, ob ich das meinen Gastgebern sagen und noch einen Tag länger bleiben sollte, was aber schwierig war, weil ich meine Abreise schon angekündigt hatte. Es fiel mir auch keine andere Lösung ein. Der Bahnhof war in einem anderen Ort, zu dem man auch auf einem längeren Weg erst gelangen musste. Ich welss nicht mehr, ob die Szene mit der Bankpost daraus direkt hervorgegangen war, oder noch etwas anderes dazwischen lag. (330 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3204 (1994-06-11, 05:45 - Zürich)Ich sah Wasser aus der Decke des Zimmers herabstürzen, das von einem Rohrbruch in der oberen Etage kommen musste. Ich rannte hinaus, um im Treppenhaus nach oben zu laufen und die Ursache zu suchen. Ganze Ströme von Wasser flossen durch das grosse Treppenhaus des Hauses. Sie brachen irgendwo in der Höhe aus der Wand hervor und stürzten frei durch das Treppenhaus in die Tiefe. Sie mussten von einem grossen Rohrbruch oder einer anderen geheimnisvollen Quelle kommen. Auch an vielen anderen Stellen des Hauses sah ich solche hervorbrechen. Es wurde mir klar, dass es keinen Sinn hatte, erst lange nach den Quellen zu suchen. Ich musste sofort eine öffentliche Stelle anrufen, die vielleicht etwas dagegen tun konnte. Ich fand irgendwo ein Telephon und sah im Telephonbuch eine Nummer mit der Angabe "Überschwemmungen". Ich wählte sie, und der Sprechende versprach, dass sie binnen kurzer Zeit kommen würden. Bei einem Blick aus dem Fenster sah ich, dass auch auf der abschüssigen Strasse grosse Wassermassen herabstürzten. Es sah aus wie bei einer Überschwemmung, aber wir wohnten auf der Kuppe des Berges, wo nirgend woanders her mehr das Wasser kommen konnte. Nach einer Weile schien das Wasser weniger zu werden im Haus, so dass ich mir schon überlegte, was ich sagen solle, wenn es garnicht mehr flösse zu dem Zeitpunkt, wenn die Leute von der angerufenen Stelle kämen. Dafür kamen aber jetzt von unten gleichsam Ströme von Menschen ins Haus, die alle unermüdlich die Treppe hinaufstrebten und dem Dachboden zu. Es mussten Leute sein, denen als Notschlafstelle unser Dachboden zugewiesen war. Und so war es auch. Sie drangen unerbittlich in den Speicherraum ein und kamen bald auch in unsere im obersten Stock gelegene Wohnung. Ich sah, wie Kinder ein anderes Kind wie ein Baby zum Windeln auf eine Fläche am Rande des Treppenschachtes legten, wo es jeden Moment herabstürzen konnte. Ich riss es zurück und merkte dabei, dass es kein Baby mehr sondern ein Kind eigentlich jenseits des Windelalters war. Ich wunderte mich, rief aber die anderen Kinder an und sagte: "Ihr dürft nicht das Kind so nahe an den Rand des Abgrunds legen", oder ähnlich. Dann bin ich wohl aufgewacht und dachte zuerst, ich hätte nichts Aufschreibenswertes geträumt. (364 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3209 (1994-06-14, 01:30 - Zürich)Besuch von Ernst Jünger. Wir sassen uns an einem Tisch gegenüber und unterhielten uns. Er war irgendwann gegen Abend gekommen und wir blieben an dem Tisch sitzen, als es dämmrig wurde, und sassen so uns unterhaltend fast die ganze Nacht einander gegenüber, denn er wurde offenbar nicht müde und brauchte wohl wegen seines hohen Alters kaum mehr Schlaf. Er genoss es offenbar sehr, so ungestört da zu sitzen und sich zu unterhalten und nicht das Licht anmachen zu müssen, sondern das nächtliche Dämmerlicht zu geniessen. Ich holte mir irgendwann eine Wolldecke, weil es mir kühl wurde, und fragte ihn, ob ich ihm auch eine Wolldecke bringen solle. Es war ihm aber nicht kühl. Schliesslich wachte ich auf und hatte eine Zeit lang garnicht das Gefühl, geträumt zu haben, wohl in dem Gefühl, dass Jünger noch immer da war. Erst nach einer Weile begriff ich, dass das geträumt war, und es kam kühle Luft von etwas weiter geöffneten Fenster her. (159 words)

In dem Hotel gab es Gegenstände aus Pelz, entweder als Teil der Ausstatttung oder als Ausstellungsstücke, deren Pelz dem meinen zum Verwechseln ähnlich sah. Ein Mann des Hotels packte darum den Pelz in meinem Mantel an und riss daran, weil er es für ein verstecktes Stück des Hotelpelzes hielt. Es löste sich dabei von dem schon alten Pelzmantel und er steckte es zurück, als er seinen Irrtum erkannte. Wenig später kam ein anderer und wollte das selbe tun. Ich herrschte ihn an und sagte, dass ich ihn verantwortlich machen werde, wenn er nicht sofort aufhöre. Ich zeigte ihm in einem Vergleich der beiden Pelze den Unterschied, sah dabei aber selbst, dass sie zum Verwechseln ähnlich waren. In meinem Pelzmantel war der Pelz von innen angebracht, während er von aussen, oder nach aussen, aus einem sehr soliden Tuchstoff war. (160 words)

Seraina küsste mich sehr lieb mit ihrem kleinen Babymund. Dann erforschte ich mit dem kleinen Jungen in der Nacht die unteren Etagen des verwunschenen Gutshauses. Irgendwo in einer Art Küche trafen wir auf einen knurrenden Hund, vor dem wir aus der offenen Haustür heraus in den nächtlichen Park flohen. Wir krochen durch die Gebüsche, um nicht unter die Fenster von seinen Eltern zu geraten, die aufwachen und uns entdecken könnten. Der Junge wurde müde und, obwohl wir ja auf einer abenteuerlichen Flucht waren, schlug ich vor, ins Haus zurückzugehen. Er stimmte zu und wir schlichen uns durch die nicht verschlossene Haustür wieder herein und gingen diesmal im regulären Treppenhaus herauf, während wir vorher in versteckten Nebentreppenhäusern herabgestiegen waren. Ich stellte mir vor, wie es sein würde, wenn wir die Eingangstür zur obersten Etage, in der die Zimmer der Familie waren und wir unsere Betten hatten, verschlossen finden würden. Ehe wir dorthin gelangten, wachte ich aber auf. (180 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3214 (1994-06-17, 05:30 - Zürich)Wir wohnten in einer Wohnung, in der gleichzeitig eine juristische Praxis eingerichtet war, zu der sich mehrere junge Juristen zusammengetan hatten. Ich sagte zu Emme, dass der Erfolg der Praxis letzten Endes davon abhinge, dass einer von ihnen bekannt war. Emme sagte: "Oder auch ich. Ich bin als Primar immatrikuliert" Gemeint war: In der Uni immatrikuliert. Primar war ein juristischer Anfangstitel. Ich wollte nun herauskriegen, ob das eine Bezeichnung eines Studienzustandes während des Studiums war, oder der Titel einer Art Vorprüfung. Einen solchen gab es nämlich auch, der aber Primus hiess. Das Gespräch drehte sich dann aber darum, dass wir in der Wohnung ein Stück hatten, wo der Teppich fehlte, etwa ein Ausschnitt im Teppich, wo man nun einen anderen Teppich hinlegen musste, und wir überlegten, was dazu geeignet sei.

Insekten und Spinnen kamen heraus. Es war sehr unheimlich. Ich schüttelte sie aus und hielt dann die Öffnung des Deckels, der die Crememasse im Inneren noch verschloss unter den Wasserhahn, wobei sich aber das Ganze erwärmte. Emme war auch in dem Raum und machte irgend etwas anderes. Ich wollte die Dose aufheben und kam zu dem Schluss, dass ich auch die weisse Crememasse noch herausspülen musste, weil sie ja schon sehr alt war. Die Dose war in ihrer merkwürdigen Form mit der Vertiefung im Deckel geheimnisvoll und attraktiv. (129 words)

Es ertönt Ölalarm, ein Geräusch von einem Warninstrument in meinem Zimmer. Man hat mir beigebracht: ich muss sofort den Ölalarmknopf, einen gelben Knopf am Rande des Zimmers, drücken, durch den eine Art Ölwehr alarmiert wird. Ich robbe noch ganz verschlafen dorthin und drücke mehrfach den Knopf, mich noch ganz schläfrig überzeugend, dass er auch wirklich gedrückt ist. Dan robbe ich ebenso wieder zurück und schlafe sofort wieder tief ein. Als ich wieder erwache, ist es bereits morgen und hell. Wieder ertönt der Ölalarm. Ich robbe wieder noch ganz verschlafen und mich noch kaum bewegen könnend zu dem gelben Alarmknopf, drücke ihn wieder mehrfach und werde nun allmählich, weil es hell ist, wach und gehe zur Zimmertür heraus. Das ganze Haus ist voller Leute. Emme ist da und ich berichte ihr vor den anderen: "Nachts um zwei ertönte Ölalarm. Ich habe den Knopf gedrückt." Noch ehe ich berichten kann, dass der Ölalarm gerade wieder ertönt ist und ich wieder den Knopf gedrückt habe, unterbricht sie mich ganz beleidigt und in einem abkanzelnden Ton vor all den Leuten und lässt dabei den Eindruck entstehen, dass ich mich die ganze Zeit gedrückt hätte, wo alle die Leute, lauter fremde Helfer, im Haus umhergelaufen seien, und ich einfach im Bett geblieben sei.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3219 (1994-06-21, 00:15 - Zürich)Ich war im Zoll bei einer Reise nach Amerika. Es waren lauter Sachen, die ich für andere Leute dorthin transportierte. Das Wichtigste war verzollt worden. Es waren Bürosachen oder etwas ähnliches. Aber es waren auffällige Sachen dabei, die dazu nicht passten und nicht verzollt waren, zum Beispiel ein gitarrenartiges, wahrscheinlich teures, Muskinstrument. Die Leute hatten gesagt, das würde gar nichts machen und gar keine Schwierigkeiten geben. Der Zollbeamte aber warf nur einen Blick auf das Ganze und sagte: "O Je, das gibt einen schwarzen Tag für Dich". Er stiess an das Musikinstrument, ohne es überhaupt ausgepackt gesehen zu haben, wobei es umfiel, und sagte: "Was ist das zum Beispiel, das sind doch sicher keine Bürosachen" Dann fragte er, warum die Karten für die Rückreise, die er bei der Abfertigung auch brauchte, obenauf lagen und offensichtlich erst jetzt ausgepackt waren. Ich sagte, dass ich sie dummerweise in den Koffer gepackt hätte in dem Gedanken: "Das ist ja erst für die Rückreise. Das brauch ich ja jetzt nicht." Das sei mir erst im letzten Moment eingefallen. Das schien ihm aber nicht recht einzuleuchten. Ich hoffte zwar noch, dass er es vielleicht bei diesen Reden bewenden lassen und weitergehen werde, wachte aber in diesem Moment sehr beunruhigt und besorgt auf. (207 words)

Man machte das, indem man sich auf weichen Boden legte, der dann später fest wurde. In einer anderen Szene ging ich eine steile gewundene Strasse, einen Hohlweg hinab, dessen Boden und Wände aus einer Art Gestein waren. Ein Mann kam hinter mir den steilen Weg hinab, der auf einem Wagen einen Mann transportierte. Der Wagen hatte keine Bremsen und wurde immer schneller. Er war schwer zu bremsen und zu manövrieren. Ich drückte mich ganz an die Innenseite einer der vielen Kurven, damit er besser vorbei könne. Das war aber offenbar auch nicht richtig, und ich stemmte mich irgendwie oben an der Wand des Hohlweges so fest, dass er unter mir vorbeikonnte. Jetzt war es aber ein Mann mit einem Pferd und andere, feindliche, Leute kamen von unten entgegen, die auch ein Pferd hatten. Die beiden Pferde gingen schäumend aufeinander zu. Jetzt war es wichtig, dass ich oben an der Wand, wo ich irgendwie einen Liegeplatz gefunden hatte, versteckt blieb.

Ich bemerkte jetzt, dass sie nach dem Neuaufstellen der Betten nicht wieder aufgestellt waren, und sagte dies. Ich sah, dass das Zimmer ohne sie moderner aussah, fand aber doch, dass wir sie wieder aufstellen sollten. Emme sagte, dass der ihre erst noch repariert werden müsse.

Später, mitten in der Nacht, kamen sie vor unserer Wohnung vorbei und hatten Briefe, die sie ans Fenster heften wollten. Da wir aber gerade wach und in der Küche waren, lasen sie sie, draussen auf der Strasse stehend, vor. Auf einem stand: "Wir gehen jetzt zum Katzensee und dann ins Theater und dann ins Bett. Bille und Martin". Auf einem anderen stand: "Wir gehen auch zum Katzensee und dann ins Konzert. Tina und Felix." Und auf einem dritten stand: "Gottseidank hatte ich kein Hochzeitskleid dabei. Sile",was die Bedeutung hatte, dass sie deswegen nichts Feierliches unternehmen musste, weil sie dazu nicht die richtige Kleidung anhatte, wo auch der Gedanke mitschwang, dass sie deswegen keine weite Reise machen musste, zum Beispiel nach Berlin. Die Kinder, das heisst unsere erwachsenen Töchter und die Männer und die Freundinnen, hatten, glaube ich, Fahrräder bei sich.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3226 (1994-06-25, 04:45 - Zürich)Ich fahre ein Baby im Kinderwagen durch die Strassen. Wir sind lange unterwegs. Das Baby muss wohl gehütet werden. Ich kenne mich aber in der Stadt nicht ganz richtig aus, muss die Wohnung, wo ich hin muss, suchen. Ich finde sie nicht richtig, oder eine Tür ist verschlossen. Schliesslich muss ich einen Eingang unterirdisch suchen und stelle den Wagen mit dem Kind kurz ab. Als ich zurückkomme, ist er nicht da. Ich bin zuerst entsetzt, merke dann aber, dass das Ganze nur ein Traum war und ich aufgewacht bin, sodass ich mir keine Sorgen machen muss. Irgendwann wache ich dann wirklich auf. In einer der Szenen des Traums war es auch Winter und ich musste das Baby durch leicht verschneite Strassen schieben. In einer anderen war die Strasse von starkem Autoverkehr belebt und ich musste das Baby dicht am Strassenrand an den Häusern entlang schieben, damit es nicht in Gefahr kam. Das war wohl die Szene, nach der ich den Eingang zu der Wohnung suchte, wo ich es hinbringen musste. Es war aber nicht ganz klar, welche Wohnung die richtige war. Es spielten wohl auch Wohnungen der anderen Geschwister eine Rolle. Nach dem geträumten Aufwachen im Traum hatte ich auch das Gefühl, mich zu erinnern, dass ich den Wagen zusammengeklappt hätte, woraus ich schloss, dass ich das Baby doch schon aus dem Wagen herausgenommen und irgendwo hingebracht hätte. Ich hatte im Traum das Schuldgefühl, das man manchmal nach dem Erwachen aus einem Traum noch hat in Bezug auf die geträumte Handlung, bis man ganz begriffen hat, dass es nur ein Traum war. So war es auch hier. Ich war aber nach dem geträumten Erwachen auf der selben Strasse wie vorher, wo der Babywagen gefehlt hatte. Es war nur die Entlastung, nun zu wissen, dass das Vorhgergehende nur Traum gewesen war, aber die Einheit des Ortes und der Zeit bleiben sozusagen gewahrt. (311 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3227 (1994-06-26, 02:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte schon vor Tagen eine offenbar schon alte Leiche auf dem Speicher des Hauses gefunden, in dem wir wohnten. Ich hatte sie entsetzt in eine schrankartige Bodenkammer gesperrt, die ich fand, und die Tür dazu abgeschlossen. Weil diese klein war wie ein Schrank, konnte ich sie nur senkrecht hineinstellen. Dann hatte ich das Ganze wohl verdrängt, auf jeden Fall völlig vergessen. Jetzt, Tage später, war ich beim Räumen auf dem Dachboden, lief die Treppen auf und ab und versorgte Sachen. Emme tat das Selbe. Plötzlich fiel mir die versteckte alte Leiche wieder ein. Ich musste unbedingt Emme um Rat fragen, was man da machen solle, und ihr deshalb die Leiche zeigen. Wir waren gerade am Fusse der Bodentreppe, die nach oben in den Dachboden führte, und ich sagte zu Emme: "Du musst unbedingt noch mal mit heraufkommen. Ich muss Dir was Wichtiges zeigen." Sie sagte: "Gleich, aber ich muss vorher noch dieses hier erledigen", und verschwand in einer Tür. Ich konnte ihr doch die komplizierte Geschichte nicht vorher auch noch verbal erzählen, so schien es mir wenigstens, und musste sie unbedingt dazu bringen, jetzt gleich mit mir herauf zu gehen. Ich überlegte mir noch, dass die Leiche vielleicht inzwischen in sich zusammengesunken sei, oder nur noch ein Haufen Knochen daläge. Was sollte man tun? Konnte man sie heimlich beerdigen, oder sollte man die Polizei suchen? Wenn man sie vergrübe, würden einen vielleicht die Leute dabei sehen, aber wenn man die Polizei riefe, würde das schwierig sein, zu erklären, warum ich sie erst noch in dem Schrank versteckt hatte, und glaubhaft zu machen, dass ich wirklich keine Ahnung über ihre Herkunft oder ihr Alter hatte. Es würde wohl lange Verhöre geben. Während ich noch auf Emme wartete, um mit ihr herauf zu gehen und ihr das Ganze zu zeigen, erwachte ich (301 words)

Dabei war nicht eine individuelle Mutter gemeint, sondern es bezog sich auf Muttertag und so etwas wie die Mutterbeziehung. Direkt danach wieder Erwachen. Ich finde mich im Bus sitzend neben Emme vor, die nun sagt, dass wir uns jetzt zum Aussteigen fertig machen müssen. (53 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3229 (1994-06-27, 03:00 - Zürich)Fussballspiel. Es ging um die Frage, wie weit kleine bewegliche Gegenstände, die man als Abschussrampen für den Fussball bezeichen könnte, in der Richtung fixiert werden sollten oder nicht. Es waren gleichsam Achsen zwischen zwei Rädern, die die Fussballspieler bei sich hatten, vor sich her schoben oder sonst irgendwie bei ihrem Lauf während des Spiels mitnahmen. Der Ball wurde da drauf gelegt und dann von dort mit dem Fuss abgeschossen. Wenn man die Richtung fixierte, was durch irgend einen Kunstgriff geschehen konnte, flog der Ball in sehr geradem Kurs in die vorherbestimmte Richtung. Das Spiel könnte dadurch aber an Beweglichkeit verlieren. Wir erlebten die Diskussion darüber, die während des Spiels zwischen den Fussballern stattfand, gleichsam life und zugleich wie am Fernsehen mit. (121 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3233 (1994-07-01, 05:30 - Freiburg)Ich habe Besuch von einem sehr freundlichen Mann aus der Nachbarschaft. Während wir miteinander sprechen, bemerkt er plötzlich in der Wand ein Loch und dann auch noch einen grösseren rechteckigen Ausschnitt, die kurz vorher noch nicht da waren. Ich schaue hinein - es ist die Wand zur Nachbarwohnung, in der Stini wohnt - und bemerke, dass man nicht hindurchsehen kann, sondern dass die Wand gleichsam aus mehreren hintereinandergeschalteten dünnen Scheiben besteht. Das Loch geht durch mehrere dieser Scheiben hindurch aber nicht durch alle. Zwischen den Scheiben sind jeweils Zwischenräume. Der Mann, der in den gleich gebauten Häusern der Nachbarschaft irgend eine Funktion hat, fragt, ob ich mit ihm in eines der Nachbarhäuser kommen kann, wo anscheinend ein ähnliches Phänomen ist. Während wir im Aufbruch sind, kommt eines der Kinder, die noch im Schulalter sind, heim. Ich sah es, während ich ins Treppenhaus herabblicke unten zur Tür hereinkommen. Auch Emme ist dort unten. Dieser Traumszene ist eine andere vorausgegangen, die mir erst jetzt wieder einfällt: Mir fallen plötzlich beim Essen mehrere Teile des Gebisses heraus. Ich fische sie vorsichtig aus dem Mund, in dem auch noch das zuletzt hineingetane Essen ist. Es sind anscheinend Teile einer Brücke, an der aber auch richtige Zähne zu hängen scheinen. Emme, die in meinen Mund hineinsieht, sagt, dass man grosse Lücken im Gebiss sieht. Das ist auch insofern schlimm, als ich gerade zu einer wichtigen Veranstaltung gehen muss, in der ich irgend eine Funktion habe, und man die Zähne auf keinen Fall in der kurzen Zeit vorher reparieren können wird. Dann folgt die oben beschriebene Traumszene von dem plötzlich entdeckten Loch in der Mauer. (269 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3234 (1994-07-02, 05:45 - Zürich)Ein Mann, wohl ein Verwaltungsbeamter, der auch für die Gefängnisse zuständig war, seine Sekretärin und ich räumten Sachen im Hof oder Garten eines Hauses auf. Dabei war auch das Gepäck eines Mannes, der ins Gefängnis musste. Der Beamte fragte die Sekretärin, was sie meine, welche Stufe da die richtige sei, vier oder sechs. Sie sagte sofort, ohne lange nachdenken zu müssen, sechs. Es waren wohl Stufen der Sicherheit oder ähnliches. Sie schien den Mann zu kennen, aber auch aus der Art seines Gepäcks Schlüsse zu ziehen. Der Mann sagte: "Ah, sie haben mich auf eine Idee gebracht. Lassen Sie uns doch das Gepäck noch mal ansehen." Offenbar hatte er auch die Funktion eines Detektivs und die Sekretärin kannte sich auf Grund langer Zusammenarbeit auch hier gut aus und wusste über menschliche Verhältnisse Bescheid. Beide wirkten erfahren aber auch gutmütig. Als sie so spontan und sicher die Antwort sechs gab, zitierte ich im Scherz den Gesangbuchvers: "Dass man ein solch hart Urteil hat gesprochen", der wohl von Luther ist und eine sehr schöne barocke Melodie hat, wohl von Bach. Es ist eigentlich ein Vers aus einer Kantate. (186 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3235 (1994-07-03, 02:15 - Zürich)Ich war im England auf Reisen in einem Zug und hatte meine Sachen, die ich in einer Tragtasche bei mir hatte aus irgend einem Grunde am Ende des Zuges auf einer Art Brüstung im Wagen ausgelegt. Relativ plötzlich kam die Station, an der ich aussteigen musste. Ich tat die Sachen schnell in die Tasche zurück, wo sie aber nun nicht mehr alle Platz hatten. So nahm ich zusätzlich einen Plastikbeutel und stopfte Dinge hinein, aber auch da gingen sie nicht alle rein. Zum Glück fand ich einen Stapel mit weiteren Plastikbeuteln und füllte hastig einen nächsten und rannte nun mit allen meinen Sachen zur Tür, weil wir schon an der Bahnstation angekommen waren. Dort hatte ich das Gefühl, dass ich vielleicht die wichtige kleine Tasche mit der Lesebrille und dem Kugelschreiber hätte liegen lassen, und fragte den Bahnsteigvorsteher, ob ich noch mal zurücklaufen könne. Anscheinend war er es, der das Signal zur Weiterfahrt des Zuges geben musste. Nun war es statt des Wagens ein gotisches Kirchenschiff, in dem ich zurücklief zum Chor. Ein älterer Mann begleitete mich aus Neugier oder Interesse dabei. Am anderen Ende des Kirchenschiffs begann schon ein Gottesdienst, gleichsam analog zur Abfahrt des Zuges in der vorherigen Version des Raumes, wo es ja ein Eisenbahnwagen war. Man konnte aber so laufen, dass man durch die Pfeiler geschützt war und von den Teilnehmern des Gottesdienstes nicht gesehen wurde. Der Mann wollte noch irgendetwas mitnehmen, was ihm gefiel. Es war zwar nicht etwas Wertvolles oder Sakrales, aber ich fand es in der Situation doch bedenklich, zumal der Bahnsteigvorsteher, der jetzt ein Kirchendiener war, inzwischen von draussen durch eine andere Kirchentür in das Kirchenschiff hineinschaute und uns dort laufen sah. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. (284 words)

Sie hatte schon einen Übergabetermin mit ihm ausgemacht. Er wollte heute kommen, um die Garage anzusehen. In wenigen Tagen war der Übergabetermin. So hatten es die Vermieter bestimmt. Emme hatte schon einen Zettel für Herrn Müller hingelegt, weil wir weggehen wollten. Ich sagte, "Aber das geht doch garnicht. Man hat uns ja noch garnicht gekündigt". Plötzlich fiel mir ein: Wir haben die Garage ja gekau"Man muss sofort Herrn Müller anrufen und ihm das sagen" Emme sagte.: "Dafür ist es noch zu früh am Tag. So früh kannst Du ihn nicht anrufen". Ich sagte: "Aber es ist doch wichtig. Sonst unternimmt er noch mehr in der Sache". Man hörte Schritte auf der Treppe, wir waren in einem Zimmer unter dam Dach. Als ich die Tür öffnete, sah ich winkend Herrn Müller die Treppe raufkommen. Er wollte also schon zu uns, um die Übergabe der Garage zu besprechen, und war vergnügt und guter Dinge. Das Zimmer, in dem wir waren, kannte er von früher her, weil er da einmal etwas zu tun gehabt hatte, das wusste ich. Nun war es also ganz einfach, ihm gleich direkt zu sagen,. dass die Garage uns gehört und wir sie nicht vermieten wollen, weil wir sie für unsere Sachen selber brauchen. Dann erwachte ich.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3238 (1994-07-05, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich sass im Innenraum eines Forschungsinstituts, in dem die Wissenschaftler an Tischen sassen und zum Teil Einrichtungen zu Experimenten mit vielen Kabeln oder Schnüren vor sich hatten, mit denen sie hantierten, während ein Vortragender oder Leiter, der im Aussehen eine gewisse Ähnlichkeit mit Bundeskanzler Kohl hatte, sich anschickte, seine Rede zu beginnen. Dabei war von der Schwerkraft die Rede und er begann, sich im Raum zu erheben. Andere taten es auch und schwebten wie er an der Decke. Ich merkte, das man bestimmte Bewegungen mit den Beinen machen musste, gleichsam wie bei Wassertreten, um in die Höhe gehoben zu werden, und tat dies auch. Nun merkte ich, dass man aufpassen musste, nicht zu plötzlich wieder abzusinken oder herabzufallen. Es musste in dem Raum eine weitgehend aber nicht völlig aufgehobene Schwerkraft herrschen. Ich war fasziniert von der Möglichkeit dieses Schwebezustandes. Dann bin ich aufgewacht und brauchte einige Zeit, bis mir richtig klar wurde, dass es ein Traum gewesen war. (158 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3240 (1994-07-06, 05:45 - Zürich)Ich ging mit Franz Zobler eine sommerliche Strasse entlang am Abend. Vor uns ging die ganze Zeit eine kleine Schar von jungen Leuten, die phantastisch gut geschnittene sommerliche Kleider anhatten in leuchtenden Farben, vor allem blau und rot, und mit raffinierten Rückenausschnitten. Sie waren vergnügt und wirkten irgendwie glücklich. Sie hatten auch sehr elegante Sommerhüte dazu auf. Ab und zu sangen sie. Es war irgendwie eine Atmosphäre wie bei Eichendorff. Am Schluss, als unser Wege sich trennten, rief ich ihnen zu: "Übrigens, das muss man doch mal sagen: Sie haben phantastische Kleider an. Das hab ich während des ganzen Wegs genossen. Es sieht sehr schön aus." Sie riefen spontan zurück: "Das ist der dritte!" Gemeint war: Sie hatten den dritten Preis bei einem Kleiderwettbewerb damit gewonnen und waren vergnügt und erfreut darüber. Mit Franz Zobler hatte ich mich, gleichsam schlendernd, über verschiedene Dinge unterhalten. Dabei sprachen wir auch über einen breiten silbernen Ring, mit einem grossen Stein, den ich trug. Der Ring hatte eine interessante, sehr moderne und sehr harmonische Form. Ich hatte ihn von jemand im Institut, ich glaube von Dieter Sträuli, erhalten, nachdem er eine Weile im Institut gelegen hatte. Ich überlegte, ob Franz ihn wiedererkennen würde, oder ihn vielleicht selbst einmal getragen hatte. Das war aber offenbar nicht der Fall. Insgesamt waren Stimmung und Atmosphäre in dem Traum sehr entspannt. Es war ein schöner Sommerabend und ich erwachte in guter Stimmung. (234 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3241 (1994-07-07, 01:45 - Zürich)Wir waren irgendwo ausserhalb der Stadt in einem entfernteren Vorort. Es war Abend und wir mussten noch in die Stadt zurück und gingen des Wegs zur Autobusendhaltestelle. Plötzlich sagte Emme: "Gleich fährt der letzte Bus und danach kommen wir nicht mehr heim. Wir müssen uns beeilen". Also beschleuinigten wir unseren Schritt, kamen aber nach einer Weile wieder ins Reden und wurden, ohne es zu bemerken, langsamer. Als Emme es merkte, sagte sie: "Nun sind wir wieder zu langsam geworden. Gleich geht der Bus, wir werden ihn kaum noch erreichen". Die Autobushaltestelle war aber schon in Sichtweite und ich bewegte mich nun so schnell wie möglich vorwärts. Aus irgend einem Grunde, musste ich dabei jetzt kriechen und kam dabei immer langsamer vorwärts. Ich merkte, dass es schneller ging, wenn ich mich quer zur Strasse legte und gleichsam seitlich vorwärts robbte. Ich musste dabei grosse Widerstände überwinden, als wenn ich schweres Gepäck hinter mir herzöge. Ein offenes rotes Rennauto kam mir in grossem Tempo entgegen und ich konnte ihm wegen meiner Unbeweglichkeit nicht mehr ausweichen. Es wich darum selber aus, musste nun aber, von der asphaltierten Strasse abgekommen, einen Graben überspringen, was ihm wegen seiner hohen Geschwindigkeit auch gelang. Dabei kam es aber ins Schleudern und musste, um sich zu fangen, einen Bogen fahren, der es nochmal in gefährliche Nähe zu mir brachte, der ich, immer noch robbend, am Boden lag. Um mich nicht zu treffen musste es nochmal einen Kreis fahren und wurde nun langsamer. Ich hoffte, dass es nicht bei mir anhalten und mich zur Rede stellen würde, weil ich dann keine Chance mehr haben würde, den Bus noch kriechend zu erreichen und festzuhalten, bis auch Emme käme. In diesem Moment kam der Bus angefahren, ein ebenso wie das rote Rennauto älteres, noch stromlinienförmiges Modell. Ich konnte mir ausrechnen, dass es langen würde, den Bus noch kriechend zu erreichen, wenn er jetzt an der Endhaltestelle anhalten würde. Er machte aber, als er niemand an der Endhaltestelle stehen sah, ohne sein Tempo zu verringern, nur einen Bogen und fuhr sofort in schnellem Tempo wieder in Richtung zur Stadt zurück. Mein erster Gedanke war, dass man vielleicht den Fahrer des roten Rennautos fragen sollte, ob er uns zurück in die Stadt bringe. Dann kam mir aber im Erwachen noch in den Sinn, dass es vielleicht auch gelingen würde, ein Taxi zu rufen. Schon wachgeworden, überlegte ich mir noch, dass es aber zu so später Stunde vielleicht schwierig sein würde, in dem Dorf ein Telephon zu finden, zum Beispiel in einer Wirtschaft, um das Taxi zu rufen. Erst dann wurde mir richtig klar, dass das ja garnicht nötig sein würde, weil es nur ein Traum gewesen war. Ich hatte aber Hemmungen, den Traum aufzuschreiben, weil ich mich darin so mühsam und vergeblich auf dem Boden kriechend vorbewegen. (464 words)

Ich war irgendwo hingekommen und hatte eine Frau so tanzen sehen und mich daran beteiligt und auch so getanzt.

Ich hatte schon zu Anfang gesagt, dass ich eigentlich nicht essen könnte und keinen Hunger habe. Ich bekam aber immer neu aufgetan und der Teller leerte sich nicht. Ich beschloss darum, den Rest stehen zu lassen, da ich ausserdem auch dringend gehen musste, weil ich noch einen Termin hatte. Der Gastgeber nötigte mich aber nun, wenigstens die schon zerfallenen Teile des Gerichtes noch zu essen. Da aber immer neue zerfielen, erklärte ich energisch, dass ich jetzt aufhören müsste, und bedankte mich höflich. Nun sagte der Gastgeber, dass ich doch vorhin gesagt hätte, ich würde zum Schwimmen gehen, und deshalb nun doch Hunger haben müsse. Ich hatte das tatsächlich gesagt, war aber dann doch nicht schwimmen gegangen und sagte nun: "Ich bin aber aber nicht schwimmen gegangen. Es ging mir auch da schon schlecht.." Das machte genügend Eindruck auf den Gastgeber, so dass er aufhörte, mich zu nötigen. (168 words)

Ein kleines Mädchen sass auf dem anderen Klappsitz und fragte Emmi, die vorne beim Fahrer sass, ob sie Rosinen oder Schokolade oder etwas Ähnliches haben könne. Emmis Mutter war sehr lebhaft.

Das war ein Teil der Prüfung im C.G.Jung-Institut, die Bille machen musste. Ich sass daneben und guckte zu. Sie redet dabei über Fachzusammenhänge. Ich überlegt mir, ob dieser Umgang mit der Materie für sie schön sei und fragte die etwas burschikose Lehranalytikerin und Prüferin: "Macht das eigentlich Spass?" Sie antwortete "Nee danke". Offenbar war sie ein mehr sprachlich intellektueller Typ. Während dieses Suchens nach den Wurzelfortsätzen unterhielten sich die beiden auch über Emmi, die ebenfalls eine Jungianische Analytikerin geworden war und eine andere Kandidatin geprüft hatte. Sie hatte sie nach dem Württembergischen oder dem Mecklenburgischen Staatsorchester gefragt, was die beiden sehr altmodisch fanden. Ich dachte daran, dass die im Schweriner Opernhaus gespielten Opern, vor allem diejenigen Mozarts, insbesondere die Zauberflöte, in Emmis Jugend eine grosse Rolle gespielt hatten, so dass es ganz normal war, dass sie nach dem Orchester fragte. Aber das knnten die beiden viel jüngeren Analytikerinnen, Bille und die Prüferin, auf Grund ihres Alters garnicht wissen und nachvollziehen.. (187 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3254 (1994-07-19, 02:00 - Freiburg)Eine Vorführung oder Vernissage, die teils Filme, teils Bücher betraf, wobei es unter anderem auch um den Druck von etwas von mir Geschriebenem ging. Zunächst wurde eine Film gezeigt, der von einer Eisenbahnfahrt handelte, bei der ein lebhaftes Geschehen in einem der Wagen ablief, das man aber, da man die Wagen von aussen sah, nur an herausfallenden Gegenständen erkennen konnte.,aus denen man auf die Handlung schliessen konnte. Dann wurde über den Film diskutiert. Das fand im Freien, wie auf der Bahnstrecke, statt. Jemand sagte, es sei ein sehr guter Film in seiner rasanten und präzisen Handlung und man könne den Geist von sowieso - er nannte den Namen eines französischen Filmmachers - daran erkennen. Ein junges Paar näherte sich, durch die Landschaft gehend, in der wir sassen und das Mädchen sagte. "Gibt es denn eigentlich den deutschen Film nicht!" Sie sagte, dass es auch deutsche Filme von ebenso rasanter Handlung und Handlungsdarstellung gäbe, für die unbedingt etwas getan werden müsste. Dann bezog sich die Bahnfahrt auf etwas Gedrucktes oder zu Druckendes. Die Manuskripte lagen im Druck auf den Verbindungsstücken zwischen den Wagen, die man immer noch von aussen sah. Es waren Güterwagen oder Viehwagen wie vorher auch, Urs Imoberdorf war hinzugekommen, weil er sich um den Druck meiner Sachen kümmerte oder daran Anteil nahm Das fand ich sehr nett und aufmerksam von ihm. Auf dem Verbindungsstück zwischen den Wagen, die jetzt real vor uns auf den Schienen vorbeirollten, lag zwischen den Manuskriptblättern auch Hartgeld. Als jemand es berührte, fiel ein Zweimarkstück herab. Jemand sagte, jetzt könne Tübingen an Stuttgart Schadenersatzforderungen stellen und das könne den Druck verzögern Er hoffe, dass das nicht geschehe. Es schien sich um eine formaljuristische Sache zu handeln. Dieses Druckgeschehen war mit dem vorherigen Filmgeschehen irgendwie identisch, gleichsam der selbe Ablauf. Das Gleichbleibende darin war vor allem die Bahnfahrt, aber jetzt real dreidimensional, während vorher als Film. In einer anderen Szene hatte das Mädchen, das vorher gesprochen hatte, einen Sonnenbrand. Es lag irgendwie zugedeckt in der Landschaft wie in einer Ackerfurche, und Emme beugte sich darüber und gab ihr Ratschläge für die Behandlung des Sonnenbrandes. Sie antwortete mit einer Stimme, die so klang, als ob ihre Worte durch eine Lautsprecheranlage, aber leise und moduliert, wiedergegeben würden. Sie bedankte sich sehr höflich. (375 words)

Wir waren in irgend einer Strasse und wussten nicht, in welche Richtung wir gehen mussten. Dann waren wir in einem Haus, in das wir wohl, um zu fragen, hineingegangen waren. Wir standen wartend im Flur, wo eine Frau vor sich hin sprach: "Morgen kommt Gorch Fock". Das war ein berühmter Schriftsteller, der auch zu dem Kongress kam und offenbar bei ihnen wohnte. Sie nannte dann noch ein paar andere Namen von Leuten, die auch bei ihnen wohnen würden. Offenbar vermieteten sie Zimmer und Emme überlegte, ob wir einfach über Nacht dort bleiben sollten. Aber die Frau war mir etwas unheimlich. Sie hatte irgendeine motorische Störung, durch die sie jeweils das, was sie gerade in der Hand hatte, zum Beispiel eine Blumengiesskanne, fortwarf, als ob ihre Hand zuckte, Sie tat so, als ob die Kanne ihr versehentlich aus der Hand gefallen war.

Ich musste unbedingt vorher noch nach Hause, um mich umzuziehen, aber dazu konnte die Zeit eigentlich nicht mehr reichen. Schliesslich war ich dann zu Hause - ich hatte wohl ein Taxi gefunden - zog mein Hemd aus und merkte in diesem Moment, dass ich nicht wusste, wo meine Hemden und Kleider waren. Ich suchte sie in meinem Barocksekretär und riss alle Schranktüren auf. Nirgends waren meine Sachen. Es war umgeräumt worden. Ich wollte Emme fragen, aber ich hatte sie schon nach draussen geschickt, um ein Taxi zu suchen. Ich wusste auch nicht mal, wann genau der Vortrag anfangen sollte und wo in Küsnacht er stattfinden sollte. In dieser Situation wachte ich auf. (145 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3262 (1994-07-23, 04:30 - Freiburg)Ich sollte, und wollte, einen neuen Lehrbereich in Zürich hinzu übernehmen. Ich brauchtedafür die Zustimmung eines Kollegen - die dafür zwar nicht zwingend war, aber es wäre aber doch gut, wenn er sie gab. Ich zeigte ihm darum die entsprechenden Briefe, die ich dafür geschrieben hatte und die zuvor noch ins Wasser gefallen waren, wo ich sie aber mit Emmes Hilfe herausfischen konnte, solange sie noch gleichsam stehend wie Schmetterlinge obenauf schwammen und so praktisch noch nicht nass geworden waren. Er schien geneigt, zuzustimmen. Ich wollte ihm nun noch von einem Vortrag erzählen, den Kurt von Fischer in dieser Sache gehalten hatte und der von der Bedeutung von Suffixen und Praefixen und ähnlichen Silben in der Sprache handelte. Der Kollege, der mir vorher von einer geheimen Schnur erzählt hatte, die über den Weg in seinem Garten gespannt war, damit Einbrecher nicht unbemerkt herein konnten, war aber schwerhörig und verstand nicht gut, was ich sagte. Ich begann darum lauter zu reden, und trat näher, als ich als Beispiel eine Wortkombination wie "aufstellen, einstellen umstellen" etc. nannte. Als ich mich im Eifer näherte, rief er entsetzt: "Halt die Schnur!" und ich konnte vor dieser gerade noch stoppen. Er zog sich in sein Haus zurück, sagte aber im Weggehen noch etwas Zustimmendes.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3263 (1994-07-24, 03:30 - Freiburg)Traum. In Russland. Es war in der Zeit vor der Wende und ich war dauernd in Gefahr, als Fremder und Deutscher erkannt und verschleppt zu werden. So musste ich viele Tricks anwenden, häufig die Identität wechseln und zeitweise auch in Frauenkleidern gehen. Emme war bei mir und half mir dabei. Wir waren in verschiedenen Zügen, die wir häufig wechselten und hatten den Plan einer Frau zur Verfügung, die vor uns schon geflohen war. Sie hatte auch einiges für uns organisiert, und manchmal musste man frech und herausfordernd auftreten, um nicht erkannt zu werden. Dann waren wir schon relativ sicher in einem eher luxuriösen Zug in einem Wagen, in dem wir ganz allein waren und keine anderen Leute. Emme wurde schon leichtsinnig und sprach laut deutsch. Ich warnte sie, da wir doch im scheinbar letzten Moment noch erkannt werden konnten. Der Zug fuhr sehr langsam durch Waldgelände und blieb oft länger stehen, so dass man schon befürchten musste, ins Aus geraten zu sein. Dann verwandelte sich der Wagen in eine Art stromlinienförmigen Schlitten und glitt schienenlos über eine Gletscherfläche. Auch das hatte die vor uns geflohene Frau für uns organisiert. Wir konnten durch eigene Körperbewegungen wie beim Schlittenfahren, die Bewegung über die abschüssige Schneefläche, die immer noch von Wald umgeben war, beschleunigen und vor dem Steckenbleiben bewahren. Schliesslich waren wir heil in Deutschland angekommen und trafen die Frau, die uns geholfen hatte, bedankten uns und waren glücklich. Es waren noch andere Menschen da, die wie wir geflohen waren, und die Frau bat mich, einer von ihnen ein Schriftstück zu zeigen, das von ihr, der Helfenden, stammte und das uns geholfen hatte. Hier erwachte ich und brauchte einige Momente, um zu begreifen, dass es ein Traum gewesen war. (286 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3266 (1994-07-26, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich lief einen Berg hinunter auf der Strasse, und mir entgegen kam ein Mann mit einem Fahrrad. Beide waren wir höflich und wollten den anderen auf der Innenseite der Strasse vorbeilassen. So steuerten wir schnurgerade aufeinnander zu. Als wir das merkten, wollte jeder den Weg auf die andere Seite korrigieren, sodass wir dabei aber weiterhin genau aufeinander zu liefen, und ich stiess mit dem Knie an den Reifen seines Vorderrades. Nun begannen wir uns gegenseitig zu entschuldigen und verstanden uns dabei gut. Ich sagte schliesslich, dass dies einer der wenigen Fälle sei, wo wirklich keiner der beiden Beteiligten Schuld sei. Er schien dies aber skeptisch zu sehen und es kam heraus, dass wir in seiner Sicht eigentlich beide irgendwie schuld waren, weil wir eben dies Ergebnis nicht vorhergesehen hatten. Ich glaube, ich habe den Mann später wiedergesehen und wir haben uns näher kennen und schätzen gelernt. Es war eine abschüssige Strasse im Wald oder am Waldrand in einer schönen Landschaft und in einer abendlichen Stimmung mit schöner Beleuchtung. (168 words)

Dann wachte ich auf und erzählte den anderen Mitfahrern des Zuges den Traum. Ein Mann sagte in dem Moment, wo ich von dem Floss zu sprechen begann: "Jetzt wird's interessant". Dann wachte ich richtig auf und Emme sagte, ich hätte im Schlaf gesagt: "Ich hab's aber schon geschrieben". Zuerst glaubte ich nach dem Erwachen, diesen Traum schon aufgeschrieben zu haben. Dann wurde mir bewusst, dass das nicht der Fall sein konnte. (94 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3270 (1994-07-28, 07:30 - Zürich)Jemand schenkte mir einen Kuchen. Auf dem Kuchen, beziehungsweise seiner Verpackung, war ganz eindeutig ein Bild des Wohnzimmers in meinem Elternhaus in perspektivischer Ansicht zum Fenster hinter dem Esstisch hin. Man sah auch die seitlichen flankierenden Möbel. Aber statt der Decke des Zimmers erschien ein blauer Himmel mit weissen Wolken wie auf einem Bild Magrittes. Ich hatte diese Abweichung zunächst garnicht bemerkt. . Es sah ganz natürlich aus und gab dem Bild einen faszinierenden Ausdruck. Ich zeigte das Bild dem Mann, der mir den Kuchen geschenkt hatte. Es war Wolfgang Ehlers, der als Kind in meinem Elternhaus gewesen war, und fragte ihn "Erkennst Du es?" Ein Mädchen stand daneben, das sofort sagte: "Ich erkenne es", aber hinzufügte: "Aber vielleicht ist es nur ein Ku". Ich fragte: "Was ist ein Ku?" Sie sagte: "Ein Bild, das so gemacht ist, dass es Verschiedenem überzeugend ähnlich sieht". Ich fragte: "Wie schreibt man Ku, mit dem Buchstaben Q, oder anders?" Wir kamen dann darauf, dass das Bild auf der Tüte war, in die er den Kuchen gesteckt hatte, und wohl nicht genuin zum Kuchen gehörte. Ich war aber immer noch ganz fasziniert von der Echtheit des Bildes, das sozusagen den Zustand des Zimmers vor fünfzig Jahren heraufbeschwor. (203 words)

Ich roch daran, an einer kleinen Flasche, die er bei sich hatte, und sagte, es sei ein Geruch, der an den Geruch von Arvenholz erinnere, wie man es in hölzernen Stuben in den Bergen verwende. Er war ganz entzückt von dieser Identifikation, denn es war Arvenöl. Ich war sehr stolz auf sein Lob und auf meine gute Riechfähigkeit, (116 words)

Es gab das dort, war aber im Turm ganz kurz unter der Spitze oder den Glocken. Es war also offenbar jetzt ein auf der Grenze stehendes Gebäude. Er wollte es dort holen lassen..

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3274 (1994-07-30, 06:30 - Zürich)Jemand hatte eine Zeichnung gemacht, um sich damit zu habilitieren. Es wurde ihm nun klar gemacht, dass das nicht geht, dass eine Habilitation sprachlich sein muss. Er liess darum von dem Vorhaben ab. Es war eine zugleich schöne und sachliche Zeichnung, die Objekte darstellte, die so aufgestellt waren, dass sie zugleich einem dreidimensional gezeichneten Stadtplan glichen, etwa wie den dreidimensionalen Stadtplänen Roms. Im Stil glich sie einer Zeichnung von Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Später, die Zeichnung lag noch auf dem Tisch, kam ein anderer Professor vorbei, der sie nachdenklich betrachtete und, als er hörte, dass es ein Habilitationsvorhaben gewesen war, das man abgelehnt hatte, nachdenklich meinte, dass es vielleicht doch gehen würde. Wir kamen nun zu dem Schluss, dass er ja über diese Zeichnung und über Zeichnungen schreiben könnte und so doch eine Habilitation daraus werden könne. Ich beschloss, zu ihm zu gehen und ihm das zu sagen und dachte noch, dass es eben der Vorteil einer Zeichnung ist, dass sie liegen bleiben und so später noch jemand in die Augen fallen kann. Dann erwachte ich und brauchte einige Momente, bis ich begriff, dass das ein Traum war, den man aufschreiben kann, wohl weil ich dachte, das sich eine Zeichnung ja nicht aufschreiben lässt. Sie lässt sich aber beschreiben. (209 words)

Es ging in dieser Verhandlung vor allem darum, ob ihr diese Tat zuzurechnen sei oder nicht. Das Gericht, eine Art Schöffengericht, das in einer Kirche stattfand, kam zu dem Schluss, dass ihr die Tat nicht zuzurechnen sei. Sie wurde hereingeführt und ihr dieses Urteil, mit dem der Prozess gleichsam zu ihren Gunsten ausging, verkündet. Dann leerte sich der Raum und ich hörte einen Mann, wohl einen Juristen, zu seinen Begleitern sagen, dass dies ein Urteil sei, bei dem sozusagen offen bleibe, ob sie die Tat begangen habe. Die Leute gingen dann auch hinaus und die Kirche war wieder leer und ich verliess sie. Es war eine Kirche, die wie eine norwegische Wikinger-Holzkirche wirkte, (126 words)

Sie sagte: "Ich hatte gehofft, dass das bei mir nicht so würde, aber jetzt ist es genau so". Ich sagte: "Das musste so kommen und konnte nicht anders sein. Dafür sind wir uns viel zu ähnlich". Gegen Ende des Gesprächs kamen wir auf die Stimme und Bille sagte, dass ihre Stimme gerade sehr gespannt sei. Ich sagte, dass man Sprachübungen machen könne, die entspannten, legte mich zurück und sagte den Vers aus den Sprachübungen auf, den sie mitsprach" Ping, pang, pong. / Schwing den Gong, / Pong, ping, pang, nicht zu lang / Ping, pang, pung, Jung nun ist's genung." Dann wachte ich auf, aber nur im Traum, und begann, den Traum aufzuschreiben mit der Hand auf ein grosses an der Wand hängendes Blatt, das wie eine Leinwand war. Mein Füllfederhalter versagte immer wieder, aber die Schrift war gerade noch lesbar. Leute, die vorbeikamen, lasen mit. Ich füllte Zwischenräume, um den Text des ganzen Traumes unterbringen zu können. Es war wie ein Gemälde. Als ich fertig war, wachte ich richtig auf und merkte nun, dass ich überhaupt noch garnichts geschrieben hatte. Ich war zuerst ziemlich enttäuscht davon und brauchte einige Zeit, bis ich mich entschliessen konnte, zum Computer zu gehen und das Ganze noch mal zu tippen. (242 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3285 (1994-08-07, 02:30 - Zürich)In einer Zeitschrift erscheinen Bilder, die Personen aus vergangenen Zeiten darstellen und zugleich bestimmte Berufe. Diese Bilder sind zugleich den Autoren des Verlags zugeordnet, die über Personen aus diesen Zeiten geschrieben haben, zu denen die Bilder ausserdem auch passen sollten. Nun geht aber die Rechnung nicht auf, denn es sind zu viele Bilder über handwerkliche Berufe da. Die Personen der selben historischen Zeiten, über die die Autoren und Autorinnen geschrieben haben, sind aber natürlich in erster Linie nicht Handwerker, so dass die Bilder dann nicht zu diesen passen. Nun werden die Autoren gefragt, ob sie einverstanden sind, dass eines dieser an sich schönen Bilder handwerklicher Art ihnen und den von ihnen beschriebenen Personen aus der selben Zeit zugeordnet wird. Aber sie sind alle dagegen, was man zuerst nicht begreift, denn es sind schöne Bilder, bis man diese eben beschriebenen komplizierten Zusammenhänge und Zuordnungen durchschaut. Beim Nachdenken über die Lösung dieses komplizierten Problems wache ich auf. (155 words)

Ich ging mit Felix spazieren und wir beschäftigten uns mit den Bildern von Tieren, die in Grösse und Gestalt zueinander passen mussten. Es waren Umrisszeichnungen. Dann waren wir in der Aula und es ging irgendwie darum, die Bilder zu projizieren und in Grösse und Ausschnitt einander anzupassen. Sie sollten einen Raum gestalten. Ich zeichnete dann die Namen der Tiere in ein schon bestehendes Bild aus Worten ein und versuchte, sie so einzupassen, dass sie sich harmonisch zu den schon bestehenden verhielten. Dann schrieb ich diesen Traum auf, aus dem ich jetzt erwacht war, und Emme redete mit Tina und sagte, in den Träumen, die ich da aufschriebe, passiere überhaupt nichts. Es hiesse bloss: "Wir gehen spazieren. Wir sind in der Aula" und so weiter. Durch Zufall sagte sie immer das, was ich wirklich gerade aufschrieb. Als ich mit dem Aufschreiben des Traums fertig war, wachte ich wirklich auf und war enttäuscht, als ich merkte, dass ich in Wirklichkeit noch garnichts geschrieben hatte. (170 words)

Es stellte sich heraus, dass er die Aufgabe hatte, mich zu beobachten. Von wem und wozu erfuhr ich nicht.

So kamen wir in den Hof der Burg, der ein grosses hohes und gewölbt überdachtes Achteck darstellte. Treppen führten herauf in die Höhe. Verschiedene Leute kamen dort herunter, zum Teil leicht schwindlig von dem Weg über die offenen Treppen. Auch meine Schwester Adelheid war dabei. Manche Leute gingen wie schwebend. Dann kamen Leute, die eine Leiche trugen. Es schien auch eine Art Beerdigungsdienst dort zu geben. Die Leiche war aber nur ein langer Draht oder Drahtbügel. Eine Frau beschwerte sich, dass sie das nicht tragen könne und forderte mich auf, ihnen tragen zu helfen. Ich sagte, dass ich keine Zeit habe, weil ich auf jemand warten musste, und dass es doch auch garnicht schwer sein könne, weil es ja wirklich nur ein Draht war. Sie behauptete, es sei nur ein ganz kurzes Wegstück zum Auto, dass sie draussen geparkt hätten, und stellte sich weiter so an, dass ich schliesslich einwilligte. Der Drahtbügel, der genau die Länge eines Menschen hatte und vorne von jemand anderem getragen wurde, war in der Tat sehr leicht, aber der angeblich so kurze Weg zog sich endlos hin. So kam ich zu dem Schluss, dass ich nun sagen müsse, ich habe keine Zeit mehr, den Drahtbügel hinlegen und umkehren, um wieder in die Burg zu meinen Leuten zu gelangen. Dann wachte ich auf.

Ich selbst hatte meine Sachen auf einem anderen Bett, das übereck zu dem ihren stand.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3296 (1994-08-16, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich habe bei meinen verkehrspsychologischen Untersuchungen eine Liste angefangen, wo ich möglichst viele Dinge gleich während der Untersuchung in Form von Zahlen eintragen kann. Manches hat schon von sich aus die Form von Zahlen, wie zum Beispiel das Alter oder Nummern, die angeben, die wievielte Person es st, die ich überhaupt untersuche, die ich an diesem Ort, zum Beispiel in Karlsruhe untersuche, und so weiter. Anderes muss ich erst in die Form von Zahlen umformen. Ich erkläre einer Kollegin, die ich auch untersucht habe, die Liste, die noch ziemlich improvisiert geschrieben ist, handschriftlich und in Kolonnen, für die noch keine Striche vorgezogen sind, so, wie etwas entsteht, das man gerade erst während der Arbeit entwirft. Die Bedeutung der einzelnen Kolonnen, die ich durchnumeriert habe, habe ich auf dem Rand aufgeschrieben, wo ich es jetzt auch ablese, als ich es ihr erkläre, weil ich es noch nicht auswendig kenne. Dabei stosse ich auf eine Kolonne, wo ich an den Rand geschrieben habe: "Ich nenne es S3". Jetzt kann ich mich aber nicht mehr besinnen, was das bedeutet, obwohl ich es erst vor ganz kurzem geschrieben habe. Ich komme in Verlegenheit, wie ich das der Kollegin erklären soll, und überlege, ob ich sagen soll, dass das eben mit der Schwäche des Neugedächtnisses im Alter zusammenhängt. Ich überlege auch, ob es vielleicht den Grad der Sympathie ausdrücken soll, die ich für die untersuchte Person empfinde. Manche sind einem sehr sympathisch, das wäre dann S1, andere wenig, das wäre dann S3, und die Mittleren hätten die Bezeichnung S2. Bei diesen Überlegungen wache ich langsam auf. (261 words)

Sie warfen die Steinchen so an Wände und Randleiste, dass sie dort abprallten und in der Stube hin und her flogen. Auch ganz kleine neugeborene Tierchen lernten das ganz schnell und alle waren damit beschäftigt. Emme und ich waren entzückt über die Lernfähigkeit und den Spieltrieb der kleinen Tiere. Eines hatte Menschen beim Anzünden von Zigaretten beobachtet und machte das mit einem kleinen weissen Stein nach, den es sich vor den Mund hielt und dann mit der andern Hand eine Bewegung des Anzündens machte und das Steinchen zum Munde führte und wieder wegnahm und tat, als ob es Rauch ausblies. Bald hatten auch andere das gelernt und viele Tiere spielten so das Zigarettenrauchen. Auch ganz kleine Neugeborene konnten das ganz schnell. So war ständig ein lebhafter, vergnügter Betrieb auf dem Teppich, auf dem auf diese Weise schon viele kleine weisse Steinchen umherlagen, und auf dem Balkon, zu dem die Tür offen stand. (189 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3306 (1994-08-25, 06:00 - Zürich)Eine Frau und ein Kind gingen ins Kino. Während das Kind im Keller des Kinos einen Kinderfilm sah, war die Frau im eigentlichen Kino darüber in einen Film gegangen, dessen Regisseur berühmt war, den sie mit Namen nannte. Aus einer Einzelheit, die sie nannte, dass nämlich ein Kasten an der Wand befestigt wurde, entnahm ich, dass es ein Film war, den ich in dem selben Kino auch gesehen hatte, nämlich ein erotischer Film, der mir sehr gut gefallen hatte. Ich freute mich darüber, nun zu hören, dass dieser von einem berühmten Regisseur und in aller Munde war. Offenbar war die Tabuisierung erotischer Filme vorüber. Die Frau sprach von dem Film als einem ganz neuen, während ich den selben Film schon einmal vor Jahren gesehen hatte und darum sagte, dass der Regisseur den Film offenbar schon vor Jahren gemacht habe und er vielleicht erst jetzt bekannt geworden sei. Daran zweifelte sie aber und sagte: "Was war es denn überhaupt für ein Film?" Ich überlegte, wie man den Inhalt des Films kurz charakterisieren könne, und sagte, dass viele Mädchen darin vorgekommen waren. Das war offenbar in dem von ihr gesehenen Film nicht der Fall, und es wurde deutlich, dass wir doch nicht den selben Film gesehen hatten. Das war irgendwie enttäuschend. Dann wachte ich auf.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3307 (1994-08-26, 23:45 - Zürich)Kurz vor Mitternacht in der Nacht zum 26.8.1994) Wir fahren mit der Strassenbahn durch den Wald. Die Strassenbahn hat dort ihr eigenes Trasse und fährt ohne Weg und Steg zwischen den Bäumen durch. Sie gehört auch nicht zu dem Ort, aus dem wir kommen und in dessen Nähe der Wald ist, sondern zu einem anderen Ort, von dem wir nicht wissen, wo er liegt. So ist es ein unbekanntes System. Ich springe während der Fahrt auf, was zunächst schwierig ist, da die Türen sich schon geschlossen haben. Es gelingt mir aber, sie zu öffnen. Emme, die ebenfalls aufspringen will, kann aber die Strassenbahn nicht mehr erreichen, die jetzt ihre Geschwindigkeit beschleunigt. Ich muss darum wieder abspringen, wozu ich die Beine schon in der Luft in Laufbewegung bringe, damit ich beim Aufstossen auf die Erde nicht wegen der Geschwindigkeit stürze. So gelingt es auch. Wir wissen nun nicht, wie wir in den Ort zurückkommen sollen, weil es ein weiter Weg ist. Ich bin dann allmählich aufgewacht. (165 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3308 (1994-08-26, 03:15 - Zürich)Ich sollte die Regierungsrätin, die für die Uni zuständig ist, im Wald, im Buchholz treffen. Sie beschrieb mir die Autobuslinie, die dahin führte und deren Namen etwas mit Shelley und Baily zu tun hatte, die wohl auch auf Geldscheinen zu sehen waren. Ich prägte mir das mit Mühe auswendig ein, wusste aber, als ich aufwachte, noch nicht recht, an welcher Haltestelle ich aussteigen musste. Nach dem Erwachen erlebte ich das so sehr als Fortsetzung des ersten Traums der Nacht, dass ich zunächst glaubte, ich hätten diesen Traum schon aufgeschrieben, weil ich ihn für den selben hielt. Der Bus war hier gleichsam die Fortsetzung der Strassenbahn im Wald im letzten Traum. Zuerst hatte Emme mir den Weg beschrieben und zwar als Fussweg. Auch der schien mir aber schwierig zu finden.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3310 (1994-08-28, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich ging mit Emme durch eine ärmliche Gegend in einer sehr alten Stadt. Wir waren unterwegs zu einem Sattler. Wir wussten, dass es eine Strasse nach einem Platz war und das Haus die Nummer 14 hatte. Schliesslich waren wir durch enge Gassen wie in Venedig auf den Platz gelangt. Ich sagte zu Emme, die jetzt Zweifel an der Richtigkeit des Weges hatte und meinte, es könne auch die zu dem Platz hinführende Gasse sein, die wir ja schon durchschritten hatten, dass ich einmal schnell in die nächste Gasse vorlaufen und bei dem Haus Nr. 14 kucken wolle, ob dort eine Sattlerei sei. Die Häuser in der schmalen Strasse hatten aber alle keine Hausnummer. Die Wände waren schon abgeschabt im Putz und man sah eigentlich nur unscheinbare Türen. Auf der rechten Seite, wo die geraden Nummern waren, schien es aber überhaupt keine Türen zu geben. Es schien hier die Stadtmauer zu sein, an die die Gasse grenzte. Dann endete die Gasse an einer kleinen Tür, durch die man aber hindurchgehen konnte, wenn man sie öffnete und dahinter ging die Gasse weiter. Hier waren jetzt auch vereinzelte Türen auf der rechten Seite, aber immer noch ohne Nummern, und es war auch nicht möglich durch Zählen der Türen die richtige zu finden. Schliesslich sah ich Leute vor einer Tür sitzen und fragte sie: "Entschuldigung, können Sie mir wohl sagen, wo hier das Haus Nummer 14 ist?" Sie fragten, was ich denn suche. Ich sagte, eine Sattlerei. Das schienen sie dort nicht zu kennen. Ein Junge sagte, es sei am Sowiesoplatz auf der anderen Seite. Ich fragte, ob das die Strasse jenseits des Platzes sei, von dem diese Gasse hier abging. Der Junge sagte etwas von einer Setzerei. Er hatte also das Wort Sattlerei als Setzerei verstanden. Ich merkte, dass die Sattlerei offenbar hier nicht war, erklärte dem Jungen noch, dass ein Sattler Leder nähe und der Name von den Satteln der Pferde komme, die sie früher genäht hätten, und machte mich auf den Rückweg. Jetzt hatte ich ein altes Auto, mit dem ich den Weg fuhr, der zu dem Platz mit Emme zurückführte. Dabei geriet ich von der Strasse ab in eine unwegsame Gegend, durch die wohl ein Abkürzungstrampelpfad führte. Es schien zunächst so, als ob man da auch durchkommen könne. Es war eine unebene Landschaft aus verkrusteter Erde. Aber man konnte mit dem Auto noch über die Unebenheiten wegkommen. Doch dann ging es allmählich steiler bergab und der Pfad wurde immer schmaler und endete an einem Abhang, auf dem alte Reifen und andere alte Sachen lagen und über den man unmöglich mit dem Auto fahren konnte. Es war aber auch nicht möglich, umzukehren, weil dafür nicht der Platz war, und, rückwärts zu fahren über das lange Stück, traute ich mich auch nicht, da ich eigentlich garnicht mehr richtig Auto fahren konnte. So entschloss ich mich, auszusteigen und zu Fuss zurück auf die Strasse und dort weiter zu gehen, und erwachte. (488 words)

Wir legten sofort die Arme umeinander, als wir uns auf der Tanzfläche begegneten, und begannen, in weichen walzerartigen Bewegungen zu tanzen, obwohl noch gar keine Musik da war, und als die Musik spielte, war es, als ob diese nur ganz leise sei und unsere Bewegungen, die ganz harmonisch waren, aus sich selber entstanden. Dabei wachte ich mit einem sehr harmonischen Gefühl auf. (76 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3314 (1994-09-02, 05:30 - Zürich)Traum von allerlei Tieren, zuletzt von einem Hund, der mich in sein Herz geschlossen hatte und sich, auch zu meinem Schutz, auf meinen Kopf setzte. Dann eine Versammlung von Dirnen, von denen mir eine besonders gut gefiel. Sie wirkte garnicht wie eine Dirne, sondern wie eine sehr lebendige, spontane Persönlichkeit. Dann wollte ich den Traum aufschreiben, war - im Traum- aufgewacht. Hatte aber Schwierigkeiten mit dem Computer. Es war der Labtop, dessen Bedienung mir nicht mehr geläufig war. Ich konnte ihn nicht richtig wieder anstellen, als plötzlich der Schirm schwarz wurde. Auch konnte ich die Buchstaben auf den merkwürdig angeordneten Tasten nicht mehr lesen, weil sie gleichsam abgewetzt und verwischt waren. Ich merkte, dass Emme die Heizung angestellt hatte, was mir aber zu warm schien. Schon zuvor hatte ich bemerkt, dass im Bad ein elektrischer Ofen brannte, wobei ich nicht wusste, ob er aus Versehen angegangen war, oder Emme ihn angestellt hatte, weswegen ich ihn brennen liess. Auch ein altes, an allen Ecken verbeultes Fernsehgerät, dessen Gehäuse aus Metall war wie ein militärisches Gerät, stand in dem Badezimmer, das auf diese Weise ganz voll von Sachen war, sodass man kaum mehr in die Wanne konnte. Nachdem ich dann mit dem Computer beim Traumaufschreiben nicht zu Rande kam, wachte ich richtig auf und beschloss, den Traum aufzuschreiben. (216 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3315 (1994-09-03, 02:00 - Zürich)Es ging um eine Art Erbaufteilung auf einem Gut oder in einem Gutshaus, das eine Mischung aus Roggow und Wittmoldt war. Es waren auch Wohnungen für alle Familienmitglieder in dem Haus vorgesehen, so für die Töchter, den Sohn und den Vater. Aber der Sohn sagte plötzlich, dass er auch mit in der Wohnung des Vaters wohnen wollte. Hier spielte der Bülowsche Name Kai eine Rolle. Der Vater widersprach nicht richtig. Es war mir aber klar, dass er das nicht wollte, denn der Sohn hatte ja eine eigene Wohnung in dem Haus. Ich fragte den Vater: War denn das rechtsgültig? Er lächelte und sagte : Nein. Dann waren wir, Emme und ich, irgendwo in der Stadt in einem Hotel, wo man für uns Zimmer gebucht hatte, offenbar auch für einige Tage über diese Veranstaltung hinaus, weil wir noch länger in der Stadt bleiben wollten. Wir gingen dann durch die Stadt und setzten uns in einer überdachten Stelle bei einem anderen Hotel, wo wir früher immer gewohnt hatten, auf dem Fusssteig hin, wohl auf ein Mäuerchen dort. Da ertönte der Pfiff von Bach, der früher immer unser Pfiff gewesen war, und Hf, der wusste, dass wir in der Stadt waren, aber nicht, wo, und uns, diesen Pfiff machend und durch die Stadt gehend, suchte, erschien auf der anderen Strassenseite. Er hatte einen feierlichen, irgendwie pelzverbrämten Mantel an, der ihm gut stand. Wir sprachen miteinander und ich erwachte, noch die Melodie des Pfiffes im Ohr, wobei ich bemerkte, dass diese nicht eigentlich wie unser Pfiff aus dem vierten Brandenburgischen Konzert klang, sondern eher wie eine Stelle aus Bachs Violinkonzert, die der Pfiff für Gisela und ihre Freundin, die Geigerin Barbara Renner, gewesen war.

Aber die Geleise liegen noch und man kann darauf gelangen, wenn man ein bestimmtes Ziel angibt. Am Ende der Linie steht eine Schallplatte mit dem Titel "Macht und Ohnmacht des Geistes". Dann andere Szene: Ich bin wieder in Roggow. In einem Teil des Hauses, in dem ich selten war, weil er den privaten Bereich von Herrn und Frau von Oertzen bildete, ist eine wunderbare alte hölzerne Barockwendeltreppe, die ich hinauf steige, und alles erinnert mich hier an die Jahrzehnte zurückliegende Zeit, als ich dort war. Ich sage das zu jemand, der nebenan in einer Küche arbeitet und er sagt, ja ich weiss, von einer Kachel, denn ich hatte schon vorher auf einem Brief von meiner Bekanntschaft mit dem Haus geschrieben und dabei eine Kachel erwähnt, die dabei irgendeine Rolle speilte. Beim Heraufsteigen auf der Treppe bin ich wohl augfgewacht. Auf der Kachel war irgend ein altes Bild. (167 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3317 (1994-09-04, 04:15 - Zürich)Zwei junge Männer haben im Freien in einem alten Industriegelände wohl halb im Spiel etwas aufgezogen, wo Leute Geld einzahlen und auch Zinsen bekommen. Das Ganze ist aber nur eine Art Spiel. Ich wundere mich, dass die Leute der Sache glauben und mit machen. Beide sitzen an improvisierten Schaltern auf der Erde. Ich lasse, selber am Boden liegend, den einen auf meinen Knien sitzen. Plötzlich taucht ein Professor, der eine Taschenlampe umgeschnallt hat, als Polizist auf und ruft: "Halt, Polizei", oder etwas Ähnliches. Einige Leute, die er kennt, wohl vor allem Professoren, nimmt er zur Seite, wohl, damit ihnen nichts geschieht. Bei der Überlegung, ob er das auch mit mir tun wird, wache ich auf, überlege aber im Aufwachen noch, ob man ihn nicht nach seinem Polizeiausweis fragen soll, denn ich weiss ja, dass er nicht Polizist sondern Professor ist. Vorher hatten die beiden jungen Männer noch eine Baracke in dem Industriegelände durchstöbert, in der alte Akten oder Papiere der Firma Leuna lagen. Ich hatte ihnen auch eine Postkarte gezeigt, die ich gerade von Heidegger erhalten hatte, auf der er sich für Geburtstagsglückwünsche zu einem hohen Geburtstag in den neunziger Lebensjahren bedankte. Auf der Karte hatte er sehr gross in seiner typischen Handschrift den Namen Heidegger als Unterschrift geschrieben, und ich war sehr stolz auf die Karte. Der Text schien hektographiert und in der Handschrift seiner Frau verfasst zu sein. Die Unterschrift überdeckte diesen Text, da sie ja die ganze Fläche der Karte einnahm, und war mit der Hand geschrieben. (250 words)

Dieser fragte, wieso es denn zu einer so lebhaften Reception von "Sein und Zeit" damals gekommen sei. Da Heidegger schwieg, sagte ich, diesen ansprechend: " Ich glaube, weil Sie sagten, die Frage nach dem Sein sei nicht beantwortet und noch nichteinmal richtig gestellt. Das hat eine grosse Unsicherheit ausgelöst, weil das, was vorher sicher schien, in Frage gestellt und unsicher geworden war. Gerade das hat wohl eine so grosse Attraktion auf die Leute ausgeübt." Ich merkte, dass Heidegger zuhörte. Er schwieg aber, wie es für ihn typisch sein konnte. Dann wachte ich auf und wunderte mich nach dem Erwachen darüber, dass man im Traum so komplizierte philosophische Sätze zusammenhängend sprechen konnte. (118 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3319 (1994-09-05, 05:30 - Zürich)Wir sind auf Reisen irgendwo zu Gast, wo auch ein Geburtstag von mir oder etwas ähnliches gefeiert wurde. Ich hatte sehr viel platzraubende Dinge dort geschenkt bekommen, von denen ich nun nicht wusste, wie ich sie für die Rückreise im Gepäck unterbringen sollte, zum Beispiel viele überdimensionale Pralineepackungen, deren Inhalt ich unmöglich aufessen konnte und deren Verpackungen riesengross waren. Dann war da ein ganzer Stapel von aufgerollten, von Kindern gemalten Postern und noch vieles andere, was auf keinen Fall in die Koffer ging. Die Abreisestunde näherte sich und das Problem war noch nicht gelöst. Man konnte die Dinge nicht dalassen oder wegtun, weil die Schenkenden sie dann vielleicht gefunden hätten. Auch konnte man die Pralines nicht einfach zusammenschütten und die überdimensionalen Packungen wegtun, weil auch diese dann von den Schenkenden gefunden worden wären. So stellte ich mir vor, alle diese Dunge zu grossen Gebinden zusammen zu binden, die dann eben mit in den Zug mussten. Aber ich musste vorher noch zu irgendeiner Veranstaltung gehen. So bat ich Emme, die Gastgeber um eine Rolle Bindfaden zu bitten, damit ich alles zusammen binden könnte, wenn ich zurückkam, denn wir reisten in der Nacht. Mit diesen Problemen im Kopf wachte ich auf. (199 words)

So wurde es mir immer langweiliger und ich überlegte, ob es nicht besser sei, nach Hause zu fahren, als hier tagelang allein in dem Dorf zu sein.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3322 (1994-09-07, 23:45 - Zürich)Der Verleger Helmuth Kindler hat eine Art Aphorismen zur Kunst von mir bekommen. Ich bin extra noch einmal hingefahren, um mit ihm darüber zu sprechen. Er sagt, "Das ist nicht nötig" und beginnt dann improvisiert auf dem Flur mit dem Manuskript in der Hand, zu entwerfen, wie er es verschiedenen Zeitungen und Zeitschriften schicken will. Sie müssen es verlangen. "Nur worum man kämpfen muss, ist etwas wert, was man geschenkt bekommt, wirft man weg", sagt er. Es ist deutlich, dass ihm die Aphorismen sehr gut gefallen haben und er sie nun so herausbringen will, dass sie bekannt werden. Ich bin sehr glücklich darüber, denn ich hatte eigentlich über irgendwelche Begleitumstände mit ihm sprechen wollen, die ich noch nicht erwähnt hatte, weswegen ich ein schlechtes Gewissen hatte. Nun war das garnicht mehr nötig. Es war ein Gefühl, wie wenn eine Dichter erfährt, dass ein berühmter Verleger seine Gedichte angenommen hat. Kindler hatte einen Verband um die Hände, weil er sich entweder geschnitten hatte, oder irgendwie verunglückt war. Deswegen hatte ich auch ein schlechtes Gewissen, ihn jetzt nochmal zu stören. Um so glücklicher war ich über seine positive Reaktion. (187 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3323 (1994-09-07, 06:15 - Zürich)Ich ging mit Emme in einer Stadt wie München spazieren. Schliesslich hatten wir uns ganz verlaufen und gelangten zwischen zwei Kirchen, von denen jede hochaufragend mit der Längsseite zur Strasse stand, die zwischen beiden gleichsam eine Schlucht bildete. Ich war hier früher schon einmal gewesen, auch damals hatte ich mich verlaufen. Beide Fassaden waren wie von Wasser abgeschliffen, wie abgewetzt, so dass die Struktur nur noch andeutungsweise erkennbar war. Die eine hatte man mit Farben wie mit Blüten bemalt, die früher nicht da waren und die über die Strukturen hinweggingen,. Die andere war ganz schwärzlich und glänzend geworden und die Strukturen, Pfeiler und Rillen wie auf flachen Säulen, waren nur noch andeutungsweise erkennbar und Emme, der ich es zeigen wollte, sagte, dass sie überhaupt keine Struktur mehr sehe. Dann gelangten wir auf einen freien Platz mit Ausblick in eine nebelige und wolkenverhangene Landschaft, aus der sich in der Ferne Berge mit Burgen abhoben, die, als ich sie Emme zeigen wollte, gerade wieder im Nebel verschwanden. Auch ein Schloss sah man, dessen Umrisse aber ebenfalls im Nebel kamen und gingen, sich enthüllten und wieder verschleierten. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. (188 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3324 (1994-09-08, 23:55 - Zürich)Ich war in einem Kloster, um Mönch zu werden. Dazu gehörte ein Ritual von Gesprächen, um die Echtheit der Absicht zu prüfen. In diesem Zusammenhang hatte ich auch die Anweisung, für ein solches Gespräch die Kellertreppe herab zu steigen. Ich ging darum durch das grosse barocke Treppenhaus des Klostergebäudes herab in eine Halle, wo verschiedene Angehörige des Klosters waren, und begann, den Eingang der Kellertreppe zu suchen. Viele von den Anwesenden waren sehr erstaunt und einige zeigten mir schliesslich befremdet den Eingang und liessen merken, dass das eine verrückte Treppe und eine komische Idee sei. Ältere deuteten an, dass das eben dazu gehöre, und ich sagte, als ich auf die Kellertür zuging, dass das offenbar ein Ritual sei und man wahrscheinlich nach einiger Zeit wieder raufkommen würde, wenn man merkte, dass das zu Nichts führen würde. Alle verliessen unauffällig den Saal und ich betrat durch eine unansehnliche Tür die Treppe, die aber mit einem Art stacheligen Stroh oder eigentlich mit einer Art Dornen bedeckt war, in denen man stecken blieb, wenn man sich bemührte, diese Treppe herunter zu gehen. Auf diesem Stroh lag ein mit Schreinmaschinenschrift bedeckter Papierbogen, auf dem lange Sätze standen des Inhaltes wie. "Ich bin mir bewusst, dass der Weg der heiligen Mutter Theresa ein dornenreicher Weg ist", oder ähnlich. Es war mir nun klar, dass das eine Art Prüfung war, bei der man aber unweigerlich an den Beinen zerstochen wurde und auch die neue braune Hose, die ich angezogen hatte, Risse bekommen würde. Ich überlegte, dass man natürlich mit verschiedener Intensität den vergeblichen Versuch machen könnte, befehlsgemäss dort herab zu steigen, und dass man auch nur so tun, eine Weile warten und wieder herausgehen könne. Vor allem aber überlegte ich mir, ob es sinnvoll sei, in eine Gemeinschaft einzutreten, die sich so abstruse Initiationsrituale ausgedacht hatte. Schon zuvor beim Herabsteigen der grossen Haustreppe hatte ich mir aus dem Fenster schauend überlegt, ob ich denn einer Vereinigung beitreten wolle, bei der ich praktisch eingesperrt sein würde. Bei diesen Überlegungen auf der Kellertreppe wachte ich dann auf und war zunächst so befremdet über diesen merkwürdigen Traum, dass ich ihn nicht aufschreiben wollte. (354 words)

In einer anderen Szene des Traums war es Susi, die kam um den Kasten unter unserem Esstisch zu installieren, weil das der Ort war, wo er am günstigsten in ihre Wohnung hineinwirken würde, die im Traum unter uns, und nicht, wie in Wirklichkeit, über uns, lag. Das Problem war aber, wie man den Kasten unter dem Tisch so aufstellen sollte, dass man nicht beim Essen mit den Füssen darauf trat. Dann wachte ich auf und beschloss, den Traum aufzuschreiben, schlief aber wieder ein und träumte dies Aufschreiben nur, um dann erneut aufzuwachen. Dieser Vorgang wiederholte sich mehrfach.

Ich sagte, man müsse sie wegräumen und versorgen, wusste aber nicht recht, wo, weil sie an keinen systematischen Ort passten. Hans Biäsch nahm sie an sich, legte sie auf einen seiner Tische und sagte, er werde sie aufheben, es seinen schöne Zeichnungen. Sie hätten eine enorme Tiefenwirkung. Ich freute mich sehr über dieses Lob und seine Anerkennung meiner Zeichnungen. Eine der Zeichnungen zeigte sehr schmale Gestalten, etwa in der Art El Grecos. Sie bildeten eine Gruppe, in deren Anordnung vor allem Biäsch die grosse Tiefenwirkung gesehen hatte. (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3331 (1994-09-12, 03:30 - Zürich)Ich war bei einer Institution, wo man gestohlene Gartensachen melden konnte. Ich hatte eine Tube mit irgend einer Substanz, aus der ein Teil der Masse fehlte, weil jemand anders offenbar die Tube für sich gebraucht hatte, und wollte nun wissen, ob es irgendeine allgemeine Massnahme dagegen gäbe. So sagte ich zu dem Mann am Schalter, als ich mit der Tube zu ihm kam, dies sei an sich eine Bagatelle, und er antwortete: "Ja, das ist bisher noch nicht vorgekommen, dass jemand mit einer Tube kam". Ich sagte: "Warten Sie erst mal", und begann, ihm zu erklären, dass ich nicht wegen dieser speziellen Tube käme, sondern um zu erfahren, ob es eine allgemeine Massnahme gäbe, sich gegen solchen Missbrauch aller Tuben, die man hatte, zu schützen. Er dachte ernsthaft darüber nach und fragte: "Haben Sie die Tube denn geringelt?" Das war offenbar eine gängige Massnahme, um zu sehen, ob jemand aus der Tube etwas geklaut hatte. Man musste einfach einen Bleistiftstrich um die Tube herum ziehen an der Stelle, bis zu der sie schon ausgedrückt war, dann konnte man sehen, ob jemand sie danach noch unerlaubt für sich gebraucht hatte. Dann war ich nach diesem Gespräch mit dem Schalterbeamten unterwegs in dem Gebäude. Es gab dort ein System von kleinen Kammern, wo man sich ausruhen oder wohl auch übernachten konnte. Das war wohl für die vielen Menschen eingerichtet, die von weit her kamen. Ich suchte mir ein Bett in einer solchen Kammer. Es waren immer mehrere Kammern zu einem kleinen Raum vereinigt. Um auf die Toilette zu gehen, ging ich durch eine Tür aus diesem Raum noch einmal hinaus. die aber in eine andere Richtung führte als die, durch die ich hineingekommen war. Ich war jetzt auf der anderen Seite des Gebäudes, in dessen Mittelwand die Kammern offenbar als ein System integriert waren. Das ganze Gebäude war eine Klinik, wo die Seite, in die ich jetzt geraten war, offenbar die internen Behandlungsräume enthielt, während die ander Seite mehr für den allgemeinen Publikumsverkehr war. Da es viele solche Türen zu den Kammern gab und sie nicht weiter als mit einer Zahl gekennzeichnet waren, prägte ich mir diese ein mit dem Merkwort "21-Klo-Nebentür", was wohl soviel bedeuten sollte wie: "Das ist die Tür Nr. 21, durch die ich als Nebentür auf der Suche nach einem Klo hinausgegangen bin." "Nebentür", weil es ja nicht der Haupteingang zu dem Zellensystem war, der ja auch in eine ganz ander Seite des Gebäudes geführt hätte. Mit diesem Merkwort im Ohr wachte ich auf und musste nun wirklich auf die Toilette gehen. (424 words)

Ich muss dazu die haltende Hand wegen der ungewohnten Haltung mit der anderen Hand unterstützen. Zudem muss er, um beim Giessen richtig in die Tasse zielen zu können, mit dem Finger seiner anderen Hand gleichsam in die Tasse zielen, weil er irgend eine Verwundung hatte, die ihm das Zielen beim Eingiessen schwer macht.

Ich wollte mich eigentlich von seinen Reden distanzieren und ein neutrales Gesicht machen. Er war aber so bei der Sachen und hatte ein so lebhaftes Mienenspiel, wobei er mir unter buschigen Augenbrauen in die Augen schaute, dass ich automatisch hineingezogen wurde und zum Mitspieler wurde. Ich merkte auch, wie sehr es ihm Ernst war. So sagte er, dass wir es natürlich mit lauter Knochen und ähnlichem beim Menschen zu tun hätten, den wir behandelten, aber alle diese Knochen eben doch ein Seele hätten. Er sagte das alles irgendwie anekdotisch und nebenbei und zugleich auch hintergründig und eingeflochten in die sich fortspinnenden Geschichten. (187 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3336 (1994-09-16, 03:15 - Zürich)Ich drehe an unserem Radio und stelle fest, dass ich nicht mehr auf Anhieb den Südwestfunk finden kann. Ich wundere mich, dass man so etwas so schnell vergessen kann. Denn ich war nur kurz verreist. Es ist ein Radio mit Mittel-, Lang- und Kurzwellenbereich und ich suche den Südwestfunk im Langwellenbereich, habe aber das Gefühl, dass das nicht richtig ist. Wir wohnen in Bayern. Ich wollte die Acht-Uhr-Nachrichten hören. (69 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3338 (1994-09-17, 00:15 - Zürich)Ich begann, einen Traum, den ich gehabt hatte, im Computer aufzuschreiben, wobei ich so sehr in den Text vertieft war und auf die Tasten blickte, um mich nicht zu verschreiben, dass ich garnicht auf den Bildschirm sah und nicht bemerkte, dass ich durch irgend eine Manipulation bewirkt hatte, dass das Geschriebene absatzweise in ganz verschiedenen Schriften auf dem Bildschirm erschien. So war ein Absatz in griechischen Buchstaben geschrieben, ein anderer in einer Geheimschrift wie Zapf-Dingbats, andere in merkwürdig zusammengedrängtem und altertümlich wirkendem Druck. Es war mir klar, dass ich das in Ordnung bringen konnte, indem ich nach und nach mit Hilfe der entsprechenden Computermanipulationen die Schriften verwandelte in die normale Schreibweise. Ich hatte aber jetzt nicht die Kraft dazu und beschloss deshalb, die Sache so stehen zu lassen und diese Rückverwandlung, die dann dem entsprechen würde, was ich auf den Tasten gesehen hatte, später zu vollziehen. So sicherte ich den Taxt des Traums in dieser surrealen Form und erwachte. - Später hatte ich einen zweiten Traum, und als ich diesen aufschreiben wollte, fiel mir ein, dass da ja schon der erste Traum mit den merkwürdigen Schriften im Computer sein müsste. Als ich aber auf den Bildschirm blickte und diese Schriftstücke nicht fand, wurde mir erst klar, dass dieses verschlüsselte Aufschreiben nur ein Traum gewesen war und ich in Wirklichkeit noch garnichts geschrieben hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3339 (1994-09-17, 00:30 - Zürich)Ich fuhr mit der Strassenbahn, in der ich aber auch irgendwie zu wohnen schien, denn ich hatte an den verschiedensten Stellen Gegenstände verstaut oder versteckt, die mir gehörten, da nirgends genug Platz für mein Gepäck war. Eine Frau kam an einer Haltestelle herein, die einen Schirm verloren hatte und nahm einen, den der Fahrer ihr gab. Dann ging sie wieder hinaus . Bald danach kam eine andere, die ebenfalls einen Schirm verloren hatte, und es stellte sich nun heraus, dass das derjenige war, den der Fahrer der ersten gegeben hatte. Dann kam eine dritte, die eigentlich wieder die erste war, und sagte: Wann bekomme ich nun eigentlich meinen Schirm? Das war offenbar der, den der Fahrer der Zweiten gegeben hatte. Sie suchten nach einem weiteren Schirm und der Fahrer fand einen an einen Holm neben dem Vorderfenster bei seinem Fahrersitz gelehnten. Er zeigte darauf und sie rief entzückt, dass das der ihre sei. Dem Schirm fehlte aber, als der Fahrer ihn nahm, jede Festigkeit, und in diesem Moment fiel mir ein, dass es nur eine leere Schirmhülle war, in die ich beim Räumen, als der Fahrer nicht da war, Sachen von mir gestopft hatte, die ich anders nicht unterbringen konnte. So lief ich ganz schnell nach vorne, um ihm das Gebilde aus der Hand zu nehmen. Er hatte aber schon hineingelangt und Socken, Unterhosen und andere Wäschestücke herausbekommen. Ich erklärte ihm das, nahm das Gebilde an mich und verstaute es schnell in einem Spalt zwischen Sitzbank und Aussenwand dort, wo ich sass. Dann erwachte ich. (255 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3340 (1994-09-18, 02:40 - Erfurt)Ich ging mit einem Kollegen und anderen eine Asphaltstrasse entlang, die durch einen Hohlweg einen Hang hinab führte in einer Stadt, deren Häuser oberhalb des Hohlwegs aber durch Bäume verdeckt waren. Das Gespräch drehte sich um verschiedene Erlebnisse im Institut. So erzählte der Kollege von einem Tanzfest, bei dem ich sehr weiche, ganz alte Schuhe getragen hatte, die ihm irgendwie imponiert hatten. Es war offenbar ein dem Festanlass angemessenes Kostüm gewesen. Auch von irgend einem gedichtartigen Schriftstück, das Assistenten verfasst hatten, war die Rede. Man sah es auch als Schriftstück. Als wir in eine Kurve kamen, fuhren neben uns lautlos zwei Männer auf einem Leichtmotorrad und stürzten, wobei der eine sich am Kopf verletzte und stöhnte. Mein erster Gedanke, der mir durch den Kopf schoss, war: "Hoffentlich kann man hier irgendwie wegkommen und muss sich nicht um das Ganze kümmern". Aber beim nächsten Schritt, der uns in die Kurve führte, erblickten wir auf der Strasse liegend vier Schwerverletzte von einem andern Unfall, der gerade geschehen sein musste. Sie lagen an verschiedenen Stellen mitten auf der Asphaltstrasse in dem Hohlweg. Der vorderste war am Kopf blutig und bewegte sich leicht. Es herrschte eine unheimliche, lautlose Stille. Jemand sagte etwas über den vorderen Verletzten, dass er blutig sei, oder ähnliches, und dieser antwortete ironisch "gevierteilt". Er war also bei Bewusstsein. Der Kollege neben mir betrachtete die Situation und flüsterte vor sich hin: "Nirgends ein Polizist. Noch niemand hat telephoniert", und sagte dann: "Los, was stehen wir hier. Wir müssen sofort umkehren und telephonieren". Ich kehrte mit ihm um, und wir gingen durch die Kurve den Hohlweg bergan zurück. Ich wusste, dass es bis zum letzten Haus, das wir gesehen hatten, ein ziemlich langes Stück war, und fragte den Kollegen, ob es denn kein anders Haus in der Nähe gäbe. Er sagte: "Nein, wir müssen ganz zurück". Dann gingen wir weiter in diese Richtung, und ich erwachte mit Kopfschmerzen und sehr erschüttert von dem Traum. (322 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3342 (1994-09-19, 02:30 - Erfurt)Viele verschiedene Dirigenten, die alle bei einer Art Dirigententagung auftraten. Sie waren sehr verschieden in Stil und Verhalten, einige sehr beherrscht und präzise in den Bewegungen, andere mehr hysteriform sich gebärdend. Ein Dirigent, der aus Asien stammte und sehr berühmt und erfolgreich war, war fast hysterisch in seinem Verhalten. Er wollte das Orchester zu ganz bestimmten Formen der Bewegung und des Auftretens zwingen und wandte dazu kasernenhof-artig wirkende Methoden an. Schliesslich sagte ein ganz vorne sitzender japanischer Cellist leise zu ihm, sie seien alle hier, um Musik zu machen, und nicht, um besondere Haltungen und Formen der Bewegung zu lernen. Nun war aber der Dirigent beleidigt und erregt. Er schwang sich über die Sitzreihen der Bänke, auf denen wir bei der Tagung sassen, und andere folgten ihm dabei, auch ich tat das, um ihn zu beruhigen, weil sie fürchteten, er wolle sich etwas antun. Schliesslich hatte er sich beruhigt und dirigierte das Orchester sehr gut, wenn auch in einem eher romantischen Stil. Eine andere Traumszene war vorhergegangen, in der wir am Rande eines Hohlweges auf einer Böschung gingen. Meine Begleiterin wollte an einer bestimmten Stelle die Böschung hinab zurück auf den Weg gehen. An dieser Stelle war aber die Böschung zu steil und ich hielt sie deshalb davon ab, um sie lieber an eine geeignetere Stelle zu führen. (218 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3343 (1994-09-20, 01:30 - Naumburg)"Der Himmel ist blau. Text in Lehmannmappe" Das waren die Merkworte, mit denen im Kopf ich mich mitten in der Nacht auf den Weg in den Wald machte. Es war ein Text, den Emme einmal, als die Kinder noch klein waren, geschrieben hatte, der mit den Worten "Der Himmel ist blau" begann. Emme erinnerte sich, dass wir ihn einmal zusammen mit anderen Sachen, die wir nicht mehr brauchten, im Wald vergraben hatten. Er war in einer Mappe aus Pappe, die irgendetwas mit dem Arzt Dr. Lehmann, dem Nachbarn in Nagold, zu tun hatte. Dort waren die Sachen hineingelegt worden, weil sie gerade zur Hand war und auch weg sollte. Jetzt aber tat es uns leid, dass wir den Text fortgetan hatten, und wir sagten, dass wir ihn einmal wieder von dort holen sollten. Ich beschloss daraufhin, gleich mitten in der Nacht, wo wir dies Gespräch geführt hatten, loszugehen, weil ich es nun nicht wieder aufschieben wollte. Es war dunkel und regnete, als ich losging. Ich dachte mir, dass der Text, der schon lange im Wald lag, durch Regen und Wetter schon sehr gelitten haben müsse. Ich erinnerte mich gut an die Stelle, wo er lag, und wusste, wo man vom Waldweg abgehen müsse, um ihn zwischen Bäumen am Boden eingescharrt zu finden. So fand ich die Stelle auch auf Anhieb und begann im schwachen Licht der Nacht, zwischen den Sachen die nur leicht mit Erde zugedeckt waren, zu suchen. Ich fand schnell die beige-gelbe Mappe, in der er war. Er lag dort zusammen mit Zeitungsausschnitten von Bildern, die die Kinder früher gesammelt hatten, und ich beschloss, auch diese mitzunehmen. Der Text und die Zeitungsausschnitte waren noch kaum vom Regen verändert. Man konnte ihn im Dunkeln nicht lesen aber doch erkennen, dass er es war, sah Emmes Schreibmaschinenschrift auf dem weissen Papier. Die anderen Sachen, zwischen denen die Mappe lag, brauchten wir wirklich nicht. Ich nahm aber noch ein gelbes Couvert mit meiner Adresse, das zufällig mit herauskam, mit hoch und knüllte es zusammen, um es zu Hause weg zu schmeissen, damit man uns daran nicht identifizieren konnte, wenn jemand die weggeschmissenen Sachen fand. Ich hatte auch meinen Federhalter zwischen den Fingern, den ich mitgenommen hatte, offenbar in dem Gedanken, ich könne ihn bei der Sache brauchen. Ich hielt ihn sorgfältig weiter zwischen den Fingern und nahm die gelbe Mappe mit dem Text in die Hand und machte mich auf den Rückweg. Dabei wachte ich allmählich auf. (406 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3345 (1994-09-21, 02:30 - Naumburg)Ich begegnete Herrn Muramoto, dem Japaner aus Kyoto, den ich als einen Mann der Gelehrsamkeit und Nachdenklichkeit kennen gelernt hatte. Doch jetzt war er offensichtlich ein Mann der Entscheidungen und des Handelns. Wir waren bei einem Kongress, oder einer Art Messe, wo er mich begleitete, zwischendurch aber offensichtlich immer wieder kurz Dinge betrachtete und dann etwas entschied, wie ihren Ankauf oder ihre Anschaffung. Es schien, als wenn er das für einen grossen Konzern tat, in dem er entweder eine führende Rolle hatte, oder der ihm gehörte. Aber wegen seiner überaus höflichen und zurückhaltenden japanischen Art, war das nicht leicht zu erkennen. Es war aber gleichzeitig auch wie ein wissenschaftlicher Kongress, wo wir uns befanden. Er war gerade von Japan hierher geflogen und es schien, als wenn er mir etwas Neues zeigen wolle, eine Art und Möglichkeit blitzartig schnellen Fliegens, die einen unmittelbar von einem Ort zu einen entfernten anderen, zum Beispiel von Europa nach Tokio bringen konnte. Ich erwachte mit der Überlegung, wie es wäre, wenn er mich als ersten Europäer mit diesem neuen Verkehrsmittel sozusagen nebenbei einmal ganz schnell nach Tokio und zurück fliegen lassen wolle und ich dann zu Emme, wenn ich sie bei dem Kongress, wo wir beide waren, wiedertreffen würde, sagen würde: "Ich war gerade in Tokio".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3347 (1994-09-23, 04:30 - Halle)Ich treffe Verena Kast und andere Personen aus Sankt Gallen in der Eisenbahn. Sie sind auf dem Wege nach Zürich. Auf dem Wege zur Bahn sind sie völlig durchnässt worden und sitzen eingehüllt in Wolldecken, zum Teil unter den Tischen und Bänken, da. Eltern trocknen ihre Söhne ab mit Handtüchern, die sie dabei haben, weil sie wohl in Zürich zum Schwimmen gehen wollten. Sie wirken, so durchnässt und sich abtrocknend, wie eine verschworene Gemeinschaft. Wir sprechen darüber, wie man solche unvorhergesehenen Dinge nicht vermeiden kann, wie man das Leben nicht festlegen und zuvor in Ordnung bringen kann. Ich fühle mich irgendwie zu ihrer Gemeinschaft zugehörig. Vorher gingen noch andere Traumszenen, die ebenfalls vom Bahnfahren handelten.Ich musste mit viel Gepäck irgendwo einsteigen und brauchte einen Doppelsitz. Das war ein Sitz, wo die Lehen und auch die Sitzkissen doppelt, das heisst in doppelter Lage, waren. Ein bestimmter Anteil der Sitze war so und unter bestimmten Bedingungen musste man auf solchen sitzen. Eine etwas hysterische Frau, die hinter mir einstieg, wollte mich durch Stöhnen auf ihre Lage beim Einsteigen aufmerksam machen und dadurch mich bewegen, ihr etwas abzunehmen. Da ich aber selber sehr viel Gepäck hatte und mich beeilen musste, um den nötigen Doppelsitz zu erreichen, tat ich so, als wenn ich es nicht hörte. (212 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3348 (1994-09-24, 02:00 - Halle)Ich war in Roggow. Das Gespann, mit dem wir gekommen waren und auch weiter fahren sollten, stand oben am Kopf der sehr alten aus Holz gemachten ausgetretenen grossen Treppe. Der Wagen war ebenfalls aus sehr altem schweren Holz, eine Kutsche, wie ein Schrank gearbeitet und sehr schwer und gross. Eine junge Frau aus der Nachbarschaft kam hinzu. Ich fragte, wie das grosse schwere Fahrzeug wohl die Treppe runter kommen sollte. Sie sagte: "Haben Sie noch nie ein Gespann gewendet?", schob den grossen schweren Kutschwagen einfach auf die Stufen und liess ihn die Treppe hinuntergleiten, was er mit grosser Geschwindigkeit tat. Ich dachte, er würde mit Wucht an die Wand auf dem Treppenabsatz prallen, aber sie fing ihn elegant und scheinbar mühelos auf und lenkte ihn wieder mit einer Drehbewegung den Rest der Treppe hinunter. Die Pferde waren in diesem Moment nicht mehr dabei, wurden wohl getrennt die Treppe heruntergebracht. Sie war eine junge, sehr selbstverständlich, natürlich und etwas burschikos wirkende Adelige. Unten kam ihre Mutter dazu und sie fragte sie: "Mutti, aus welchem Holz ist der Wagen gemacht?" Die Mutter sagte: "Aus Dornenholz". Ich erinnerte mich, in meiner Kinderzeit dort den Namen des Holzes gehört zu haben, der aber nicht eine bestimmte Baumart zum Ausdruck brachte, sondern anders hiess, zum Beispiel wie "Steinholz," und sagte das. Emme war auch da und wir kletterten auf den Wagen zur Weiterfahrt. Im Anfang des Traums, ehe die junge Frau aus der Nachbarschaft kam und den Wagen übernahm, war auch eine Tochter des Hauses dagewesen, die den Wagen wohl vorher gelenkt hatte. (258 words)

Ich war gerade im Bad, einem altertümlichen Raum. Er fasste an die Tür, um hinein zu gehen, und steckte einen Schlüssel hinein, als sie nicht aufging. Ich hatte aber von innen abgeschlossen. Da ich noch nicht begonnen hatte, mich fertig zu machen, beschloss ich, schnell wieder hinauszugehen, damit er hineingehen könne und keine Zeit verliere, bevor er zur Arbeit ginge,denn er tat seine Arbeit auch in diesem Traum als Verleger. Es war eigentlich das Privatbad des Hausherren. Deshalb beschloss ich, so zu handeln. Ich räumte noch schnell die Dinge wieder in die richtige Ordnung und ging dann zur Tür und erwachte. (133 words)

Vorher andere Szene, wo ich auf dem Wege zur Bahn eine Böschung hinablief. Diese erwies sich aber als steiler und höher, als es ausgesehen hatte und war ein kleiner Abhang aus vulkanischem Gestein. Ich musste mich sehr konzentrieren, um herabzukommen. Es gelang mir aber, und beim Versuch, mich festzuhalten ergriff ich ein Glas, das wie in einem Badezimmer in der Wand, so hier im Felsen irgendwie befestigt war. Es gelang mir, dieses so zu greifen, dass es nicht kaputt ging, Unten musste ich in meine Schuhe schlüpfen, die ich in der Eile mit den Füssen angelte. Dabei erwischte ich zunächst alte ausrangierte Schuhe, die durch den Regen zu eng geworden waren, dann aber doch die richtigen. Daran schloss sich die Szene an, wo ich Emme zurief: "Wir müssen zum Zug". Mit diesen Worten im Ohr erwachte ich. (188 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3355 (1994-09-28, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte eine Geburtstagsfeier. Es war ein runder Geburtstag und diese Situation stellte sich in verschiedenen Szenen dar. Einmal war es eine Art Feldlager und alle lagen irgendwie da und warteten, wie es in solchen Situationen üblich ist. Ein älterer Mann kümmerte sich sehr nett um mich, aber ich fühlte mich depressiv. In einer anderen Szene sassen wir alle am Tisch und es wurde gegessen. Aber es passierte nichts. Das lange Sitzen machte mich auch da eher depressiv. Es war in alle den Szenen nicht ganz klar, der wievielte Geburtstag es war. Einmal war es wohl der sechzigste, in einer anderen Szene, derjenigen, aus der ich schliesslich aufwachte, der fünfzigste. In der letzten Szene sassen wir feiernd im Auto. Viele Familienmitglieder waren da, aber es geschah auch hier eigentlich nichts und das Dasitzen war anstrengend. Schliesslich nahm Tobi, der vor mir sass, einen Geldbeutel, den ich hatte, einen Reisegeldbeutel aus Stoff, der aber leer war, um damit zu spielen. Er warf ihn mutwillig aus dem Fenster des Autos, das am Strassenrand stand, so dass er auf den Fusssteig fiel. Ich fand, dass er erzogen werden müsse, und sagte darum streng: "Den holst Du jetzt wieder". Es war schon schwierig, ihn aus dem Auto rausklettern zu lassen, weil dafür ein Sitz geklappt werden musste. Als er draussen war, fand er zwar den rausgeworfenen Beutel, sah nun aber gleichzeitig ein mit Spielzeug am Strassenrand sitzendes Mädchen und begann, mit diesem zu spielen. So musste ich ihn wieder hereinholen. Es war aber schwierig herauszufinden, welches sein Spielzeug war, denn er hatte ganz schnell einige Sachen mitgenommen, und welches dem Mädchen gehörte, das zum Beispiel eine Rugelmaschine und einige kleine Autos hatte. Auf jeden Fall spielte Tobi vergnügt und die Erziehungsmassnahme war eigentlich so ausgegangenen, dass sie ihm nur zum angenehmen Spiel diente. (299 words)

Ich erklärte ihm, dass man das durchhalten werde, wenn man ausdauernd wäre und sich vornähme, nicht all zu beleidigt zu sein, wenn im Einzelnen etwas nicht gelinge, und dass man sozusagen das Glas lieber halb voll als halb leer sehen solle.

Als ich wieder aufblickte, war ich dort ganz allein. Die Anderen um mich herum hatten sich zurückgezogen und der Weg war, wie ich aufblickend sah, mir abgeschnitten. Die Truppen der anderen Seite waren jetzt ganz nah. Ich sah, dass es unmöglich für mich war, durchzukommen, und rief sie an: "Soll ich mich ergeben?" Sie riefen höflich zurück: "Es wird das beste sein". Dann war ich bei ihnen als ihr Gefangener und überlegte, dass meine eigenen Leute hoffentlich nicht hierher schiessen würden.

Darum holte ich tief Luft, um laut zu schreien und brachte ein langgezogenes Hoooh hervor, von dem ich erwachte, denn ich hatte tatsächlich geschrieen und hörte im Erwachen noch mein Schreien.

Ich fuhr oft um diese Tageszeit mit dem Bus vom Baden nach Haus. Heute aber war ich später, am Bahnhof erst, eingestiegen. Er hatte mich wohl vermisst. Ich war sehr erfreut, dass er mich kannte und mein Fehlen bemerkt hatte. Dann erwachte ich mit einem angenehmen Gefühl. (142 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3370 (1994-10-09, 06:15 - London)Wir hatten mehrere lebendige Löwen als Haustiere in der Wohnung, die friedlich auf Stühlen und Tischen lagen. Gleichzeitig waren auch Steiff-Stoff-Löwen da, die den lebendigen zum Verwechseln ähnlich sahen und von diesen wie ihresgleichen behandelt und geleckt wurden. Auch ein kleines Baby, wohl ein Enkelkind, mit seiner Mutter war in der Wohnung. Die Tür ging auf und eine auffällig angezogene Frau mit einem schutenartigen Hut kam mit einem Hund in die Wohnung, der sofort zwischen den Möbeln hindurch auf mich zu lief und meinen Finger zwischen die Zähne nahm, was er spielerisch tat. Mir und den anderen war sofort klar, das die Gegenwart des Hundes zwischen den Löwen eine Gefahr war, und wir riefen der Frau zu, dass sie den Hund sofort wieder hinausnehmen müsse. Der Hund machte aber keine Miene, zu gehen, und fühlte sich offensichtlich wohl bei uns und den Löwen. Ich sagte der Frau, dass er beissen könne und sie antwortete: "Das tut er ja schon", wobei sie darauf anspielte, dass er ja bereits meine Hand zwischen die Zähne genommen hatte, was aber doch mehr spielerisch war. In dieser Situation erwachte ich und war zunächst vor allem fasziniert von der Gegenwart der Löwen im Traum und ihrer Gemeinsamkeit mit den Steifflöwen. Auch der Hund, der gross war und ein rauhes Fell hatte, war eher vertraut und irgendwie auch erfreulich. (222 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3371 (1994-10-10, 23:00 - London)Verena Kast und ich warben gleichzeitig für das Seminar des IAP, für das wir zuständig waren. Es ging darum, Geldgeber für Verschiedenes zu gewinnen, unter anderem für ein Zeichen des Seminars, das an verschiedenen Orten aufgestellt werden sollte. Verena Kast hatte es übernommen, mit den Geldgebern zu sprechen. Ich sollte nicht dabei sein, weil auch mit mir als emeritiertem Professor irgendwie geworben werden sollte. Ich ging derweil in einem waldartigen Park spazieren und kam an einem runden Tempelchen vorbei, das mit dem Seminar etwas zu tun hatte. Da sah ich gerade Verena Kast mit den Geldgebern in der Nähe stehen, bei dem Zeichen irgendeiner anderen Einrichtung, das zufällig dort stand. Ich hörte sie zu den Leuten sagen: "Wie schön ist es doch, ein Zeichen zu haben" und merkte daran, dass sie sie nun dazu bringen wollte, dafür Geld zu spenden. Nun wendeten sie sich dem Tempelchen zu, in dessen unmittelbarer Nähe ich war, und ich beschloss, mich schnell zu entfernen, damit ich die Prozedur des Gesprächs mit den Gledgebern nicht störte. Aber nun hatte ich auf einmal furchtbare Mühe, den leicht ansteigenden Weg weiter zu kommen, war wie gelähmt und musste schliesslich kriechen, um überhaupt noch vorwärts zu kommen. Sie näherten sich immer mehr. Verena Kast erblickte mich und begann nun, so wie vorher das zufällig dastehende Zeichen, so jetzt mich und meine Gegenwart bei dem Tempelchen in die Werbung bei den Geldgebern für das Seminar einzubeziehen. Als sie gerade sagte: "Wen sehen wir denn da", erwachte ich, immer noch ganz erschöpft von der Mühe, mich gegen den Widerstand des Gelähmtseins fortzubewegen. (262 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3372 (1994-10-10, 07:00 - London)Wir waren in der Stadt und ich ging in ein Kaufhaus, um Silber- und Metallputzmittel zu kaufen. Es gab drei Sorten: In Plastik verpackt, in Metalldosen und in Pappe. Ich beschloss, dass Plastikverpackte nicht zu kaufen, weil ich nicht wusste, wie es sich im Gepäck im Flugzeug verhalten würde und ob es nicht bei Unterdruck aus der Verpackung dringen würde. Dann war ich später nochmal zusammen mit Emme in dem Kaufhaus, um weitere Metallputzmittel zu kaufen. Die Verkäuferin konnte sie zuerst nicht finden, fand sie dann aber an einer anderen als der gewohnten Stelle. Ich vermutete, dass das mit meinem vorherigen Einkauf zusammenhinge und die vorherige Verkäuferin sie an diese falsche Stelle zurückgestellt hätte. Dann wachte ich auf, schlief aber gleich wieder ein und träumte nun, dass ich den Traum aufschrieb, beziehungsweise Emme diktierte, die ihn in die Schreibmaschine tippte. Als sie mit dem Traumtext fertig war, musste sie irgendetwas anderes tun und ich setzte mich an die Maschine, um die Einfälle zu tippen. Emme hatte aber eine eigerückte Schreibweise gewählt, die ich nicht beherrschte. Deshalb stand ich noch einmal auf, um sie danach zu fragen, ging zu ihr und erwachte nun endgültig. Erst allmählich wurde mir klar, dass der Traum überhaupt noch nicht aufgeschrieben war und ich dafür zum Computer gehen müsse, den ich im Bad des Hotelzimmers aufgebaut habe. (221 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3373 (1994-10-11, 00:30 - London)Ich war Beisitzer und Mitprüfer in einer Habilitationsprüfung einer jungen Frau, in der es um die Frage ging, wann Haydn und wann Mendelssohn in der Stadt gewesen waren, in der die Prüfung stattfand, und ob die Person, die Gegenstand ihrer Habilitationsschrift war, beiden in dieser Stadt begegnet sein konnte. Ich kannte durch Zufall Daten aus einem Archiv dieser Stadt, die die Thesen der jungen Frau bestätigten. Sie aber war inzwischen ganz mutlos geworden, weil sie bei der Habilitation Widersacher gehabt hatte, die ihr Schwierigkeiten machten. Ich versuchte, sie zu überzeugen, dass ihr Weg der richtige sei und sie nicht aufgeben solle. Das gelang mir auch. Sie verliebte sich im Laufe des Gesprächs in mich und wollte mit mir ins Bett gehen. Dazu hätte auch ich Lust gehabt, mir war aber klar, dass das nicht geheim bleiben konnte und ihr und mir schaden würde, weil es den Regeln des gegenseitigen Verhaltens von Prüfer und Geprüfter widersprach. Ich sagte ihr das und erwachte. (161 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3374 (1994-10-11, 07:00 - London)Ich hatte einem Mann zur Habilitation verholfen, der sich hinterher recht auffällig benahm. Er hatte ein Winkelprofil und ging so dicht beim Lesen an den Text heran, dass er aussah wie ein pickender Vogel. Wir mussten darüber lachen, aber Hilty, der neben ihm stand, machte ein ernstes Gesicht,als ob er sagen wollte, wen habt ihr uns denn da eingebrockt. (59 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3375 (1994-10-12, 01:30 - London)Ich arbeitete in einem Institut oder den Räumen einer Forschungsgesellschaft, wo die Sätze und Zitate der Literaturgeschichte daraufhin betrachtet und geordnet wurden, in welcher Höhe über dem Meeresspiegel, also in welcher räumlichen Höhe sie gedacht oder geschrieben waren. So ergab sich ein System von Sprachschichten nach der räumlichen Höhe geordnet, wo Zitate und Sätze aller Art aus der ganzen Welt und von den verschiedensten Autoren nebeneinander standen nur nach diesem Prinzip der räumlichen Höhe ihres Entstehungsortes oder Sprechortes oder Schreibortes. So ergaben sich in diesen Sprachhöhenschichten Zusammenhänge zwischen den entlegensten Zitaten aller Zeiten, Autoren und Orte. Die einzelnen Zitate erschienen dabei wie in einer durchsichtigen Hülle, in der sie alle gleichmässig aussahen, oder wie in dem leicht verschleiert wirkenden Bild auf dem Computerschirm, wo sie aber alle gleichmässig ausgerichtet sind. Das System von Sprachschichten faszinierte mich. Gleichzeitig dachte ich aber darüber nach, wie es wäre, wenn Shakespeare nicht gelebt hätte, wie viel Zitate und literarische Werke dann so, wie sie von Shakespeare beeinflusst existieren, nicht existiert hätten. Bei diesen Gedanken, die offenbar anderen, nämlich zeitlichen und geschichtlichen Sprachschichten folgten, wachte ich dann auf. (183 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3376 (1994-10-13, 05:15 - London)Wir waren in einer Kirche, in der es zunächst unordentlich aussieht, was aber garnicht stimmt, sondern gezielte Nonchalance ist. Wir lasen ein Buch über den Pfarrer, der das Ganze so eingerichtet hat. Ein Wendeltreppenhaus, in das man mit einem Spiegel hineinsehen konnte. Es mündete von unten in den grossen weiten und eher flachen Raum der Kirche, der wie ein Saal war, wie viele englische Kirchen. Das Wendeltreppenhaus war gleichsam das eigentliche Geheimnis der Kirche, verbunden mit ihrer Grosszügigkeit und Gelassenheit. (80 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3377 (1994-10-14, 04:00 - London)Ich war in einem Grandhotel, aber in einem alten ziemlich wackeligen Zimmer mit einem schrecklich lauten Ventilator am Fenster. Ich dachte, wie gut, dass wir nur eine Nacht da sind, und wachte auf. Aber das Ventilatorgeräusch hörte nicht auf. Es kam von aussen durch das Fenster von einem Ventilator ausserhalb. Ich machte das Fenster zu und schlief wieder ein. Jetzt waren Emme und ich in einer Suite in einem Hotel, die mehrere Zimmer hatte und auch eine Treppe zwischen verschiedenen Räumen. Bille kam zu Besuch und hatte ihre Tiere bei sich, weil sie niemand gefunden hatte, der sie hüten konnte. Es waren zwei Katzen und zwei Hunde und eine grosse Schar von kleinen Küken, die aus einem Gefäss herauskamen und sich sofort über die Treppe und fast alle Räume der Suite ausbreiteten. Glücklicher Weise konnte man die Tür zum eigentlichen Wohnraum noch schliessen, ehe sie dort auch eindrangen. Dieser hatte auch die Tür, die aus der Suite herausführte, so dass man also nicht fürchten musste, dass die Küken durch diese auch aus der Suite herauskamen und im Hotel herumliefen. Ich hatte einige Bedenken, aber Bille fand das ganze ganz normal und sagte, dass sie immer mit den Tieren reise. Ich stellte mir vor, was passieren würde, wenn das Hotelpersonal die Räume putzen und dabei die Türen auflassen würde, wie dann Hunde, Katzen und Küken hinauslaufen und sich im ganzen Hotel ausbreiten würden. Später sah ich noch einen an die zur Suite gehörende Treppe angrenzenden Raum, wohl eine Art Küche, in dem Hotelpersonal war. Ich hoffte, dass sie sich um die Tiere kümmern würden. (263 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3378 (1994-10-14, 07:00 - London)Wir waren wieder in der Hotelzimmersuite, derselben wie im vorhergehenden Traum der Nacht. Emme hatte neben meinem Bett einen Staubsauger aufgestellt und sagte, er müsse da stehen, weil es keinen anderen Platz dafür gäbe. Ich sagte, das fände ich aber garnicht schön, weil ich ihn dann von meinem Bett aus sehen würde, und es gäbe noch Nebenräume in der Suite, wo er stehen könne. Emme nahm ihn und ging damit in das Zimmer der Kinder und sagte zu denen, er müsse dort stehen. Dann hörte ich ein furchrtbares Gepolter wie von einem umfallenden Schrank und lief in das Zimmer. Dort sah man zwar keinen umgestürzten oder schrägstehenden Schrank, der gerade im Fallen war und aufgefangen werden musste, aber einen über Kopf stehenden. Er musste sich beim Sturz gleichsam um sich selbst gedreht haben und ich hörte Emmes Stimme aus dem Inneren. Bille und Emme mussten in dem Schrank gewesen oder ihn ihn hineingeraten sein, als er umfiel. Ich sagte zu ihnen "Seid Ihr überkopf oder richtig rum?" Emme antwortete: "Ich glaube richtigrum". Der Schrank stand mit den Türen zur Wand und ich stellte ihn darum leicht schräg, um hineinsehen und sie herausbringen zu können. Es fiel mir auf, dass man Bille nicht hörte und ich rief sie deshalb mit Namen an: "Bille, - Bille" Aber sie antwortete nicht. Sie musste bewusstlos sein, hatte vielleicht bei dem Sturz des Schrankes eine Gehirnerschütterung bekommen. Ich sagte: "Ich glaube, wir brauchen einen Arzt" und erwachte sehr beunruhigt. (244 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3379 (1994-10-15, 04:00 - London)Man betrauerte den Tod des Sohnes einer Familie. Diese Trauerszene fand im freien statt und der Sohn lag auf dem Ast eines Baumes über uns, was wohl ein altes Ritual war. Plötzlich fiel er herab und bewegte sich. Emme lief sofort herzu, um zu helfen. Da erhob sich die Gestalt. Es war eine Tänzerin, und die ganze Szene war nur gespielt gewesen, was nach der schaurigen Szene sehr erleichternd war. Die Frau sprach Emme an und nannte sie Herr sowieso, weil sie Emme mit jemandem verwechselte. Emme kannte sie aber von früher, wohl vom Goldschmiedekurs, und nannte sie mit Namen. Sie hiess Marianne oder ähnlich und erkannte nun, wie aus einer Art Trance erwacht, auch Emme und es war ein erfreutes Wiedersehen. (122 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3380 (1994-10-15, 05:00 - London)Wir waren mit einer Gesellschaft unterwegs, die wohl zu einer Tagung gehörte. Wir sassen in einer Wirtschaft zusammen, Ich sass auf einer nicht sehr breiten Bank, die auch ein Einzelstuhl sein konnte. Eine schwangere Frau, die auch zu der Gesellschaft gehörte, setzte sich neben mich. Es war aber für beide nur so wenig Platz, dass wir nun ganz dicht aneinander sassen. Es war noch ein anderer Stuhl da, eigentlich nur eine Lehne und ein Sitz, die man auf eine Couch gesetzt hatte, die an den Tisch grenzte. Ich setzte mich nun dahin, eigentlich nur aus Höflichkeit, um der schwangeren Frau genügend Platz zu lassen, und sagte etwas entsprechendes. Eigentlich aber tat es mir leid, denn das enge Zusammensitzen mit ihr war sehr gemütlich gewesen. In einer anderen, wohl vorhergehenden Szene war eine junge Frau da, die vom Tisch aufstand, und eine Laute holte, die sie schon vorher in der Nähe placiert hatte. Sie sagte "Ich hab nämlich eine gute Stimme" und bereitete sich vor, etwas zu singen. Emme, die sie schon früher gehört hatte und der ihr Gesang gefiel, sagte etwas Positives, wohl aber auch mehr nur aus Höflichkeit, aber die Gastgeberin, die rechts neben mir sass, meinte: "Ich weiss nicht, ob das den anderen Leuten die die auch hier in der Wirtschaft sitzen, gefällt". Das fand ich eigentlich auch. Etwas später sagte die Gastgeberin: "Wir haben jetzt zwei Möglichkeiten. Wir können nach Hause gehen, oder hierbleiben und noch etwas tanzen." Emme war für das Tanzen und ich auch und wohl auch alle anderen. Offenbar war in der Wirtschaft um diese Zeit Tanz vorgesehen. So standen wir zum Tanzen auf und ich erwachte. (273 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3381 (1994-10-15, 06:30 - London)Es klingelte, wodurch ich aus dem Schlaf geweckt wurde. Ich stand aus dem Bett auf und lief durch das ganze, weitläufig angelegte Hotelzimmer und durch eine gläserne Zwischentür zur Zimmertür. Es war aber niemand da. Ich hatte das Klingeln nur geträumt. So ging ich zurück und legte mich wieder ins Bett, um wieder einzuschlafen. Das ganze Aufwachen und Aufstehen war aber nur geträumt. In Wirklichkeit hatte ich im Bett gelegen und geschlafen und wachte jetzt erst richtig auf. Das ganze Hotelzimmer in dem Traum war wie eine Suite, weil wohl in der Etage keine anderen Zimmer waren. Es standen nur einige Betten und andere Dinge in dem Raum vor der Glastür, die das Zimmer im engeren Sinne abschloss und durch die ich barfuss hindurch gegangen war. Man hatte den Eindruck, dass das Zimmer sich in einem Dachstock befand. In Wirklichkeit erhoben sich aber noch zwei weitere Stockwerke darüber, wie wir vorher bei einem Blick von aussen gesehen hatten. In unserem Stockwerk war nur eine Art Zwischendach oder eine dachartige Einziehung (170 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3383 (1994-10-18, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich bin erkältet oder vergrippt und deshalb auch tagsüber im Bett geblieben. Susi ist herunter gekommen, um für mich zu sorgen. Am Schluss, ehe sie weggeht, beugt sie sich über mich, um mir einen Abschiedskuss zu geben, den sie mir aber, um sich nicht anzustecken, nicht auf den Mund sondern auf die Nase gibt. Dann bin ich, im Traum, aufgewacht und stehe auf, um den Traum aufzuschreiben. Ich gehe ins Bad, das ein grosser ziemlich leerer und über Nacht kalt gewordener Raum ist, und stelle zu meinem Erstaunen fest, dass der Laptop, der kleine Reisecomputer, nicht dasteht. Dann fällt mir ein, dass er ja im Mittelzimmer neben dem Tischcomputer steht, und ich gehe aus dem Badezimmer hinaus, wo ich zuerst in einen Vorraum, eine Art Ankleidezimmer, komme. Ich sage zu Emme, die mir dort begegnet, dass wir über Nacht die Tür zum Bad offen lassen müssten, damit es nicht so auskühle. Die Räumlichkeit der geträumten Wohnung ist eine Art Mischung aus unserer hiesigen Wohnung in einem Haus aus der Mitte dieses Jahrhunderts und den grossen hohen Räumen des Hotels in einem georgianischen Haus in London. Auf dem Weg zum Mittelzimmer bin ich dann aufgewacht. Das erste Aufwachen war ja nur geträumt. (201 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3384 (1994-10-19, 03:15 - Zürich)Ein Haus mit sehr schönen jugendstilartigen und geschwungenen Formen, das ich bewundere. Es wird mir gesagt, dass es einmal mir gehören solle. Offenbar soll ich es erben. Das Ganze ist aber etwas unheimlich und undurchschaubar. Es leben Leute in dem Haus, die es mir zeigen, die ich aber nicht näher kenne. Die Sache ist mir recht unheimlich und ich vermeide es, irgendwie Stellung zu nehmen. Im Garten stehen zwei rote alte Porscheautos in Rennwagen ähnlichen Formen, die zum Hause passen. Auf meine Frage, wem sie gehören, bekomme ich die Antwort, dass sie mir gehören würden, weil sie, wohl ihrer schönen Form wegen, zum Hause gehören, das dann ja mir gehören würde. Dann gehen wir die Treppe hoch, um den oberen Stock des Hauses zu besichtigen. Auf dem Weg nach oben kann man aus dem Fenster blicken, wobei es einem fast schwindelig wird, denn wir kommen hier in eine solche Höhe, dass man den Uetliberg und den Zürichsee von oben sehen kann. Dies ist auch insofern merkwürdig, als das Haus dadurch in einer unegwöhnlichen Höhe liegt, aber bei Zürich, während es zuvor so schien, als wenn es an einem anderen Ort wäre. Die ganze Geschichte wird mir immer unheimlicher und ich wache auf. Nach dem Erwachen bin ich froh, in der vertrauten Wohnung hier zu sein. (215 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3388 (1994-10-21, 04:45 - Zürich)Wir schliefen alle auf einem Dachboden. Es war sehr gemütlich, wie alle auf einem Lager nebeneinander lagen. Über uns war noch ein zweiter Dachboden, der zur Seite hin offen war und dessen Rand gerade über meinem Liegeplatz am, Rande des Lagers war. Ich hörte jemand oben und sagte noch, dass es gefährlich wäre, wenn jemand von oben etwas herabwerfen würde, da hörte man oben eine Frau den Boden putzen mit einem Schrubber und Wasser. Grosse Mengen Wasser kamen über den Rand und flossen wie ein gläserner Vorhang auf mich herab. Ich stand auf, nahm meine Bettdecke und sagte, dass ich mir einen anderen Platz suchen wolle. Es war aber eigentlich kein anderer Platz da, wo man einigermassen weich liegen konnte. Erstaunlicher Weise war ich trotz der grossen Wasserflüsse garnicht nass geworden und das Putzen und Wasserfliessen hatte aufgehört. So ging ich doch zum selben Platz zurück, um dort gemütlich zu liegen. Emme oder jemand anders sagte, als wir meinten, man müsse sich beschweren, die Leute, die da geputzt hätten, seien die, die eigentlich auch Anspruch auf den Platz hätten, auf dem wir lagen. Sie gehörten zur chinesischen Botschaft. So sagten wir nichts und legten uns wieder schlafen. Andere Szene. Wir warteten gemeinsam auf die Strassenbahn. Als sie kam, hatte ich gerade meine Leselupe in der Hand und steckte diese schnell in eine Reissverschlusstasche des Dufflecoat und zog den Reissverschluss zu, wobei aber der Griff des Vergrösserungsglases noch herausragte. Nun war die Zeit zum Einsteigen knapp geworden. Der Einstieg war eine provisorisch flach gelegte kurze Leiter mit ziemlich grossen Abständen zwischen den Sprossen, über die ich mit meinen Sachen, die ich irgendwie zusammengerafft hatte, schlecht hinwegkam. Ich hatte ausser dem Mantel, den ich irgendwie über den Arm gelegt hatte, noch einen Rucksack, vermisste aber meinen zweiten Rucksack, den ich immer dabei hatte. Ich sagte, ich könne ihn nicht finden, und jemand sagte, ich hätte ihn heute garnicht dabei gehabt. Ich konnte mich jetzt auch dunkel daran erinnern, dass ich ihn diesmal nicht mitgenommen hatte. Meine Schwierigkeit, über die flachgelegte Leiter in den Bus herein zu kommen, in dem alle anderen schon drin waren, stieg aber. Ich hatte jetzt auch nicht mehr genügend Kraft, um mich zusammen mit dem Gepäck dort hoch zu ziehen. Der Busfahrer, neben dessen Sitz der Einstieg war, wurde langsam ungeduldig, half aber nicht, und ich begann, mir auszumalen, wie es wäre, wenn ich nicht mitkäme und er mit den anderen abführe. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwachte ich mit einem Gefühl der Schwäche, das mich zuerst davon abhielt, den Traum überhaupt aufschreiben zu wollen. (425 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3390 (1994-10-23, 04:15 - Zürich)Ich bin in einem schwäbischen Hotel, in dem es zwei verschiedene Sorten Zimmer gibt, die normalen und feinere teurere, zu denen es mehrt zusätzlichen Comfort gibt. Für jedes Zimmer und jeden Gast ist ein Kopfhörer da an einer langen korkenzieherartigen Schnur, aus dem er alles erfahren kann, was er wissen muss, alle Hinweise erhält, so dass er sich um nichts mehr kümmern muss, auch wann er zum Zug muss bei der Abreise, und alles. Für die Leute in den feineren Zimmern gibt es auch noch mehr Sonderheiten beim Essen. Auch das kann man alles durch den Kopfhörer erfahren und bestellen. Man sieht die Kopfhörer, die gerade nicht benutzt werden, an langen korkenzieherartigen Schnüren beziehunhgsweise Kabeln parallel nebeneinander liegen. Sie führen zu den verschiedenen Zimmern. Auch wenn man sich ausserhalb von diesen befindet, hat man sie und kann sie aufsetzen. Aus ihnen ertönt dann eine solide schwäbische Stimme, die, glaub ich, in den zu den teureren Zimmern gehörenden noch etwas feiner klingt. (161 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3391 (1994-10-24, 04:30 - Zürich)Ich wollte das Kinderzimmer der Wohnung, die aber einen anderen Grundriss hatte als die hiesige, am Boden mit Wasser auffüllen lassen, damit man ein Schwimmbecken hätte. Das war dann auch geschehen und Bille und ich hielten uns darin im Wasser auf. Es war ein grosser rechteckiger Raum und wir sprachen über Bilder, die man dort in Wechselrahmen an den Wänden aufhängen oder auf einer Brüstung aufstellen könnte. Bille meinte, wenn sie oben an die Wand gehängt würden, könnten die Kinder sie aber nicht mehr in die Hand nehmen, und war darum für das Aufstellen der Bilder. Ich hatte aber ein bestimmtes Bild im Auge, das die Kinder nicht in die Hand nehmen sollten. Es war, glaube ich das Bild der Sitzenden von Heinrich Ludwig Kirchner aus der Hamburger Kunsthalle, das im Gang der Wohnung hängt. Die beiden anderen Kinder, Belli und Tina, waren in dem Traum noch klein, während Bille schon erwachsen war. Später kam ich von dem Plan, aus dem Kinderzimmer das Schwimmbad zu machen, wieder ab, weil die Kinder dann keinen Platz mehr für das Spielzeug hätten, mit dem sie am Boden zu spielen pflegten, und es auch schwer aus den Schränken herausnehmen könnten, die immer noch an der Wand standen. In dieser Traumszene war die Idee noch nicht ausgeführt worden, so dass ich sie einfach in Gedanken rückgängig machen konnte. In einer weiteren Traumszene hatte ich eine Karte die zum ständigen Eintritt in ein Schwimmbad berechtigte, wo ich aber garnicht hinging. Ich beschloss darum, die Karte einer Bekannten zu geben, die sie benutzen konnte. Wir trafen sie auf der Strasse und ich zeigte ihr die Karte und sagte ihr das. Sie streckte sofort die Hand aus und wollte die Karte an sich nehmen. Ich sagte, sie solle noch warten, ich müsse das erst erklären. Es war nämlich eine Karte, die ich schon lange bei mir hatte und auf der "Condrau 70" stand, eine Fahrkarte für die rhätische Eisenbahn, die man zu Condraus siebzigstem Geburtstag vor mehr als fünf Jahren ausgegeben hat und die mir seitdem immer einmal wieder in die Hände fällt, weil sie in einer bestimmten Tasche eines Kleidungsstücks oder einer Mappe steckt. Ich hatte Sorge, die Bekannte könne diese Karte verlieren, wenn sie sie so schnell an sich nähme, und wollte ihr auch erst die Doppelbewandtnis der Karte erklären, die zugleich eine Erinnerung an diesen Geburtstag war und die Funktion hatte, als ständige Eintrittskarte in das Schwimmbad zu dienen. Dann wachte ich auf und fand beim Aufwachen, dass es eigentlich schade wäre, diese Karte fortzugeben, die ich schon so lange habe, und beschloss gleichsam im Erwachen, sie doch lieber zu behalten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3392 (1994-10-25, 05:45 - Zürich)Wir schliefen in einem gotischen Zimmer auf einem Gesims an der Wand, das sehr schmal war. Darum war es recht ungemütlich. Tagsüber hielten wir uns viel auf hohen schmalen Gesimsen an den Aussenwänden gotischer Häuser auf, so auch am Landesmuseum. Dabei betrachteten wir auch Dinge an den Wänden. Ich war sehr besorgt, dass Emme immer vorsichtig herabstieg, damit sie beim Aufspringen am Boden nicht ihren Knien wehtat. Einmal konnte man auf einem Bildschirm an der Wand sehen, wie Emme Orgel spielte. Sie machte dabei ein sehr ausdrucksvolles bewegtes Gesicht und war kindlich in das Spiel vertieft, das gleichzeitig stattfand. Ich wollte es ihr zeigen, während sie spielte. Sie wollte aber während des Orgelspiels nicht auf diesen Bildschirm an der Wand sehen. In einer anderen Szene fuhren wir in einem Auto auf der Strasse, das Emme steuerte. Sie wich Hindernissen auf schmalen Seitenstreifen aus. Einmal lag ein Wrack eines Autos auf der Strasse. Ich rief, in der Eile nach Worten suchend: "Achtung, Wrack auf der Strasse. Impulse vermindern", was heissen sollte: Bremsen. Sie hörte mich aber nicht und fuhr darum im selben Tempo weiter. Auch hier gelang es ihr aber, auf einem ganz schmalen Seitenstreifen vorbei zu steuern. Ich erwachte, und es wurde mit klar, dass Emme ja in Wirklichkeit garnicht Auto fahren kann, so dass diese Situation auch nicht eintreten kann. (221 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3393 (1994-10-26, 23:00 - Zürich)Das ist meine Geldrolle, rief ich hinter einem Mann her, und als er mich nicht hörte, noch ein zweites mal: das ist meine Geldrolle. Er hatte die Geldrolle, die ich unter einem Tisch oder ähnlichem suchte, wobei sie mir fortgerollt war, aufgehoben, dann aber von mir weg auf ein Bett geworfen, wo eine Frau in der Nähe war, die dort etwas räumte. Ich hatte angenommen, dass er meinte, es sei ihre. Ich ging darum dorthin und sagte noch mal, dass das meine sei. Er sagte: "Ja das weiss ich, ich habe sie für Sie dorthin geworfen". Er dachte, dass ich dorthin kommen würde. Eine längere Geschichte war dem voraufgegangen. Er war vorbei gekommen und hatte Geld gesammelt. Ich suchte in meinen Taschen und fand keines ausser einem Zehn-Rappen-Stück, das ich ihm gab worüber er enttäuscht schien. Gleichzeitig hatte er aber auch gesagt, ich schulde ihm 70 Rappen für irgend eine Dienstleistung. Ich fragte nochmal nach, und er sagte: "Sie schulden mir 70 Rappen für Briefumschlag und Telephonieren". Ich konnte mich nicht genau daran erinnern, suchte aber weiter nach geeignetem Geld und fand ein uraltes Frankenstück, dass so abgegriffen oder wie vom Wasser geschliffen war, dass man überhaupt keinerlei Prägung ausser einer winzigen buchstabenartigen Vertiefung sah, aus der man schliessen konnte, dass es ein Frankenstück war. Er kuckte es skeptisch an, und ich fand inzwischen, dass man es eigentlich wegen seiner schönen Form behalten müsse. Geben Sie es mir wieder, sagte ich darum und suchte nach den Geldrollen am Boden, wobei mir ein Mann, der auch dort etwas tat, half. Dabei rollte die eine Rolle weg, die der Mann dann aufgehoben hat, was zu meinem Rufen führte. Eine andere konnte ich mit ausgestrecktem Arm gerade noch erwischen und nahm ein Frankenstück heraus, um es ihm zu geben. Das alte abgeschliffene Stück, das ich mir hatte wiedergeben lassen, hatte eine sehr schöne organisch wirkende Form. (313 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3394 (1994-10-26, 06:00 - Zürich)Wir, Emme und ich, wohnten in der Wohnung meines Elternhauses in Schwerin, die genau so eingeteilt war wie damals ab 1938, nur war statt der Glaswand, die die Wohnung zum Treppenhaus hin abschloss, jetzt eine mobile Wand dort, die man öffnen konnte, so dass mehr Licht in den Flur kam, so wie die Wohnung ja vor 1938 gewesen ist. Solche Überlegungen stellte ich aber in Traum nicht an. Es war ganz selbstverständlich unsere Wohnung, auch nicht mit dem Bewusstsein, dass wir in die Wohnung unseres Elternhauses gezogen seien, sondern es war jetzt und hier eben einfach unsere Wohnung. Rudolf Scharping, der SPD-Vorsitzende, war bei uns zu Besuch. Aber er war viel entspannter, als er es in der Öffentlichkeit ist. Ich kam gerade mit ihm aus dem Wohnzimmern auf den quadratischen Flur. Emme hatte die mobile Wand zum Treppenhaus, die vorher geschlossen gewesen war, geöffnet, so dass viel Licht hineinströmte. Der Zitronenbaum stand dort. Scharping horchte kurz und öffnete die Tür zum Kinderzimmer. Heraus kam ein kleiner Dackel, den er offenbar gehört hatte, während ich nichts gehört hatte. Der Hund, der anderen Leuten gehörte und von uns offenbar gerade gehütet wurde, rannte schnurgerade über den Flur und durch den Gang zur Küche, in der Emme gerade kochte. Ich begann nun die mobile Wand zu schliessen, damit der Hund, den wir ja hüten mussten, nicht durch das Treppenhaus wegliefe. Emme hatte ihn ja wahrscheinlich deswegen in das Kinderzimmer gesperrt. Beim Schliessen der Mobilwand merkte ich, dass sie an zwei verschiedenen Stellen montiert werden konnte. An beiden waren eine Art Schlösser in den Wänden, wo man sie einklinken konnte, und sie selbst bestand aus mehreren Teilen, die man ebenfalls an ihren Türschlössern einfach zusammenschnappen lassen konnte. Die eine Einrichtung war etwas weiter in das Innere des Wohnungsflurs hineingehend. So war es vorher gewesen. Die andere war näher an der Treppe und machte den Flur etwas grösser. Ich wählte diese, merkte dann aber, dass dann der Durchgang von der von unten heraufführenden Treppe zu der in den obersten Stock führenden Treppe sehr schmal und deshalb für die Oberbewohner unbequem wurde. Ich beschloss deshalb, wieder die alte Position zu wählen, wobei die Wand an der rechten Seite von innen her gesehen einen Knick machte, wohl, weil dort der Aufzug war, ein Geschirraufzug, der nach oben führte. Dies alles war im Traum nur eine ganz kurze Szene, mein Herauskommen mit Scharping aus der Wohnzimmertür, sein Öffnen der Kinderzimmertür, das Hindurchlaufen des Dackels zu Emme in die Küche, die man dort hörte. Mein Schliessen der mobilen Wand, wobei ich aufwachte. (423 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3395 (1994-10-27, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich war in München in einer Pension, um ein Zimmer zu bestellen. Der Mann am Empfang sagte, als er meinen Namen hörte: "Nun muss ich etwas fragen - und ich hoffe, dass Sie ja sagen - : Sind Sie aus Göttingen.?" Ich antwortete: "Das ist eine andere Familie von Uslar, die Uslar-Gleichen heissen. Meine Familie kommt aus Goslar. Aber ich habe in Göttingen studiert, und da haben die Leute das natürlich auch immer gefragt und gesagt: 'Ah, Uslar-Gleichen' Und dann habe ich geantwortet: 'Nein, ich bin ohne gleichen'. Aber nun muss ich Sie fragen: Sind Sie aus Göttingen.?" Er antwortete: " Nein, aber ich war drei Jahre dort." Ich fragte: "Wo haben Sie gewohnt, falls Sie das noch wissen?". Er antwortete eine Adresse, die ich nicht genau kannte, aber der Name der Strasse kam mir irgendwie bekannt vor. Ich sagte dann, dass ich am Hainberg gewohnt habe, im Rohnsweg und im Nikolausbergerweg und "Am Goldgraben." Ich wachte dann auf mit der Vorstellung, dass er sagen wollte, am Goldgraben habe seine Freundin gewohnt, und dass es sich herausstellte, dass es das selbe Haus und das selbe Zimmer gewesen sei.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3396 (1994-10-28, 05:45 - Zürich)Man sah Leute über ein hohes spitzes Dach klettern, wobei sie sehr aufpassen mussten, dass sie nicht herunterfielen. Es war eine Situation wie im Kriege. Andere Traumszene: Belli hatte Fieber. Ich dachte, dass man Dr. Peter anrufen müsse, dass er ihr aber wohl kein starkes Mittel geben würde, weil sie ja gerade schwanger ist. Andere Traumszene: Emme und ich gingen über eine lange unebene Strasse, die mühsam zu begehen war. Es war wohl Winter. Dann überquerten wir die Strasse, wobei man aufpassen musste, weil die Autos ziemlich schnell fuhren. Als wir auf der anderen Seite angekommen waren, fiel uns aber ein, dass Belli ein Stück vor uns her ging und uns nun, wenn sie sich umkuckte, nicht mehr sehen würde. Wir wollten aber vermeiden, dass sie auch die Strasse überqueren würde, weil es ja gefährlich war, und beschlossen darum, wieder zurückzugehen auf die Seite, auf der sie weiter vorne vor uns her ging. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. Ich war schon zweimal vorher aus Träumen aufgewacht, weil Emme gesagt hatte: "Schnarch nicht so" und es war mir beide mal aufgefallen, dass es im Traum ganz ruhig gewesen war, man also von dem eigenen Schnarchgeräusch nichts gehört hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3397 (1994-10-29, 03:00 - Zürich)Traum. Ich hörte einen Lastwagen direkt vor unserem Haus auf der Strasse rangieren oder wenden, was man am An- und Abschwellen des lauten Motorengeräusches hören konnte. Ich schaute zum Küchenfenster heraus und sah, dass er der Grenze unseres Grundstückes und dem Rasen dabei gefährlich nahe gekommen war und in diesem Moment einen Laternenpfahl, der direkt vor uns an der Grenze des Rasens stand, umzureissen begann. Ich rief Emme, die im Wohnzimmer war, zu, ganz schnell zu kommen, damit wir rausgehen und ihn zur Rede stellen konnten, solange er noch da war. Sie kam auch, schaute zum Fenster heraus, stand dabei aber so, dass ich nicht zur Haustür konnte. Ich rief sie an, dass sie ganz schnell zur Seite treten solle, damit ich vorbeikönne und ihn noch erreichen, ehe er wegfuhr. Sie reagierte aber sehr langsam und ich kam nicht vorbei. Als ich schliesslich zur Haustür kam und hinauswollte, war diese abgeschlossen und der Schlüssel nicht da. Emme erinnerte sich, dass sie ihn abgezogen hatte, wusste aber nicht mehr, wo sie ihn hingelegt hatte. Ich schimpfte, dass nun das Lastauto wegfahren würde, ehe wir da wären, versuchte einen anderen Schlüssel, der da lag, von dem man aber gleich sah, dass er nicht passte, was Emme auch sagte, und sah durch das Fenster den Lastwagen gerade noch wegfahren. Der Laternenpfahl stand ganz schräg und sah aus, als wenn er jeden Moment kippen konnte. Schulkinder kamen vorbei und ich befürchtete, er könne auf sie fallen. Diese hingen sich an ihn, und ich wollte rufen, das sie das bleiben lassen sollten. Emme aber sagte: "Lass sie". Wahrscheinlich dachte sie, es sei besser, wenn sie ihn ganz umrissen, weil er dann nicht mehr auf einen Vorbeigehenden fallen konnte. Ich überlegte, dass es nun wohl nicht mehr möglich wäre, den Lastwagenfahrer dingfest zu machen und erwachte von einem lauten an- und abschwellenden Schnarchgeräusch von Emme neben mir in ihren Bett, in dem man das Geräusch des rangierenden Lastwagens wiedererkennen konnte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3398 (1994-10-30, 05:30 - Zürich)Wir waren in einer Klinik, wo Emme auf irgendeine Operation oder Behandlung wartete. Der Arzt liess alle Patienten von Schwestern durchs Telephon fragen, ob sie eines von zwei Medikamenten mit komplizierten lateinisch-griechischen Namen geschluckt hatten. Wir kamen zum Schluss, dass Emme beide Medikamente nicht gehabt hatte, und überlegten, ob sie andere, die sie genommen hatte, nennen sollte. Andere Szene. Vor der Haustür machten Räber und sein Sohn mit einem kleinen Auto, das sie wohl weiter verkaufen wollten, allerlei Tests und Experimente, drehten die Räder, bewegten es hin und her und schauten unter die Motorhaube und anderes. Es war ein kleines englisches Auto, wie man es in früheren Jahren oft hier stehen sah.,es heisst Austin-Mini. Emme sagte: Wenn das, was sie da machen dazu führt, dass sie es verkaufen wollen, und es nicht mehr als tausend Mark kostet, dann will ich es haben. Der geringe Preis, den sie nannte, schien mir nicht ausserhalb des Möglichen, weil es ja ein altes Auto war, aber ich wunderte mich, weil Emme ja garnicht Auto fahren kann. (172 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3399 (1994-10-31, 04:30 - Zürich)Jemand machte einen Spaziergang oder Dauerlauf, eigentlich ein Jogging, zwischen zwei Orten in Paris, von denen der eine einen Namen hatte wie ein griechischer Tempel, der andere Opéra hiess. Dort war aber weit und breit keine Oper zu sehen. Schliesslich bekam ich heraus, dass Opéra nur der Name eines Ortes auf den Champs Elysées war und ebenso der andere Ort, dessen Namen wie ein griechischer Tempel klang, die Champs Elysées aber waren eine Fussgängerzone, eine eher schmale Strasse voller Leute, durch die der Mann gelaufen war. Es war ein schmaler eher asthenischer aber sportlicher Mann, dessen Lauf wir irgendwie verfolgt hatten. (101 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3400 (1994-11-01, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich arbeitete in einer Institution, einem Haus mit mehreren Zimmern, wo über den Traum geforscht und gearbeitet und auch an einem Lexikon darüber geschrieben wurde. Verschiedene Begriffe, mit denen man den Traum erfassen konnte, spielten dabei eine Rolle. Mit Hilfe eines solchen Begriffes konnte jemand, der in einem der Räume durch einen Traum oder in einem Traum gefährdet war, gerettet werden, weil man mit Hilfe dieses Begriffes den Traum und den Raum des Hauses, in dem er sich befand, identifizieren und dadurch dorthin gelangen konnte. Es war aber auch, als wenn dadurch dieser Traum selbst, der in Gefahr geraten war, gerettet wurde. Ich freute mich darüber, dass meine Theorie und der betreffende Begriff sich auf diese Weise zugleich bewährte und gleichsam durch die Praxis bewiesen werden konnte. (127 words)

Später sahen wir ein Bild von einem anderen Kometen in der Zeitung. Es war nicht der Halleysche, aber ein anderer auch berühmter. Auch er hatte nur zwei kurze Schwänze, die aber durch ihre Farbigkeit auffielen. Beide waren blau, aber der eine war in seinem Anfang rot. Emme und mein Vater fanden beide, dass die Schwänze auf dem Bild zu kurz waren und mein Vater schnitt aus zwei blauen schwanzartigen Frotteestücken, die er zufällig hatte, zwei Schwänze, die er den kurzen Schwänzen auf dem Bild zusätzlich anlegte, damit sie länger aussähen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3404 (1994-11-03, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich war bei einer Art Fakultätssitzung. Es hatten sich in der Fakultät zwei Lager gebildet. Die einen, die rechts von uns sassen, auch durch einen Mittelgang getrennt, hatten so etwas wie Exaktheit zu ihrem Leitwort, die anderen auf meiner Seite aber Deutung. Zu meinem Erstaunen hatte es sich so entwickelt, dass ich gleichsam deren Sprecher war und derjenige, der die Anträge stellte, denen diese dann geschlossen zustimmten. Ein Dekan, der in der Mitte sass und Herrn Enskat glich, hatte dies auch etwas so arangiert. Auf meiner Seite sassen auch die Grünen, die er dafür gewann, dass sie mir zustimmten, indem er ihnen vorschlug, über Deutung und Steuergesetze zu arbeiten. Sie sassen für sich in einem Art Zelt, das senkrechte Wände hatte und ein gerafftes in der Mitte erhöhtes Dach wie ein Feldherrnzelt. Am Schluss versammelten sich vorne, es war jetzt im Freien in einer Landschaft, eine ganze Reihe Leute, die grosse Tiere bei sich hatten, zum Beispiel ganz grosse Hunde mit zottigem Fell. Es waren auch Löwen da und ich ging mit einem solchen Löwen durch die Dunkelheit und durch den Wald nach Hause. Er trottete friedlich wie ein Hund neben mir her, und ich antwortete jemandem, der fragte, ob das nicht gefährlich sei, indem ich sagte, es sei ganz ungefährlich. Das Tier war sehr friedlich und anhänglich. Ich erwachte mit der Vorstellung, dass ich eine Taschenlampe bei mir haben müsse, um andere Tiere, die aus dem Wald hervorkamen, anleuchten und dadurch verscheuchen zu können. Vorher gegangen war eine Szene, in der ein Architekt und seine Frau eine Rolle spielten, die ganz grosse Häuser bauten. Eines wurde so hoch im Entwurf, dass es zu weit emporgeragt hätte. Deshalb bauten sie es in eine tiefe Schlucht, wozu sie die technischen Möglichkeiten hatten. Das Haus musste unten keine Fenster haben, weil es einem technischen Zweck diente, so dass es nichts machte, wenn es mit den unteren Etagen in der Schlucht stand. Das Architektenehepaar hatte eine gewisse Ähnlichkeit mit Peter und Marion, aber auch Florian und die Umgebung von Rogers in London spielte irgendwie hinein. (342 words)

Ich hatte noch die braune Jugenduniform der Nazizeit an und fiel damit ungeheuer auf. Schliesslich fand sich jemand, der mir ein normales Hemd lieh, und ich war darüber ungeheuer erleichtert. Jetzt war es aber schon spät geworden und ich musste nun noch vor Beginn meinen Platz finden. Die einzelnen Gruppen sassen in Blöcken, jeweils durch eine Reihe freier Sitze getrennt, wie in Kreissektoren. Ich machte mich auf den Weg, meinen Platz zu suchen, und erwachte. (91 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3406 (1994-11-04, 07:00 - Zürich)Traum, der im Eingangs- und Frühstücksbereich eines Londoner Hotels spielt. Einzelheiten habe ich vergessen. Es war die vertraute und geborgene Atmosphäre, aber zugleich auch negative Elemente, wie Diebe, denen der Zugang erschwert werden musste, zum Beispiel durch die Art der Aufstellung der Tische im Frühstücksraum, die so gestellt waren, dass Diebe nicht leicht hindurch gelangen und auf diese Weise ins Hotel kommen konnten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3407 (1994-11-05, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich fuhr mit einem philosophischen Kollegen in seinem Auto, einem Volkswagen, den er steuerte. Dabei war er aber eingeschlafen, oder hatte eine Absence und kam nach links ab und war kurz davor, gegen einen Baum zu fahren. Ich griff ins Steuer und lenkte es nach rechts. Dabei kam es aber zu einer Übersteuerung und ich musste noch einmal gegensteueren. Inzwischen war er wieder aufgewacht, steuerte aber noch unsicher, so dass ich meine Hand noch am Steuer liess. So kam es aber weiter zu einer schlangenlinienförmigen Fahrweise und ich sagte, dass ich nicht so mit ihm zusammen fahren könne, um ihn darauf vorzubereiten, dass ich das Steuer wieder loslassen würde. Er aber fasste das so auf, als wenn ich den Wagen allein steuern wolle, und liess das Steuer ganz los. So musste ich allein steuern, was ich aber nicht richtig konnte, weil ich seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr Auto gefahren bin. So bewegte sich der Wagen weiter in Schlangenlinien und ich hatte Mühe, ihn auf der Strasse zu halten. Ich wollte das schon sagen und ihm das Steuer wieder selbst übergeben. Er war aber geistesabwesend und wohl nicht dazu in der Lage. Mittlerweile waren wir auch schon am Ziel angekommen und ich suchte nun einen Parkplatz. Es machte mir aber Mühe, den Wagen dort hinein zu steuern, und vor allem war es schwierig, ihn anzuhalten, wie überhaupt der gleichzeitige Umgang mit Gas, Bremse und Kupplung nicht richtig gelingen wollte, so dass es mir Schwierigkeiten machte, den Wagen jeweils ganz zum Stehen zu bringen, wenn andere Leute, andere Professoren, die ihren Wagen schon geparkt hatten, vor mir vorbei gingen, so dass ich sie leicht streifte. Schliesslich hatte ich auf einem Parkplatz gehalten, bemerkte aber, dass er eine Parkuhr hatte, die nur eine Stunde lang galt. Dann waren wir in einem Hörsaal und bedienten einen Computer, der wohl für diesen Hörsaal und die Vorlesung da war. Auch hier musste ich eingreifen, der Computer gehorchte aber meinem Tastendruck mehrfach nicht, war irgendwie nicht mehr ganz in Ordnung. Dann war ich aufgewacht und wollte den Traum auf Papier aufschreiben, wozu ich auch einen Bleistift fand. Als die Seite voll war und ich sie zum Weiterschreiben drehen wollte, bemerkte ich, dass die Rückseite schon beschrieben war, und zwar mit einem Vortrag Martin Heideggers, den ich abgeschrieben hatte. Ich bemerkte, dass der ganze Papierstapel, der da lag, aus solchen Blättern bestand, auf denen einseitig schon der Heideggervortrag stand und auf die ich die Buchstaben M.H. für Martin Heidegger geschrieben hatte. Ich wollte diese Blätter nicht weiter auf den Rückseiten benutzen, weil es mir zu gefährlich schien, dass ich doch noch in die Schrift des Heidegger-Vortrags geraten würde, und man das Ganze dann auch hätte noch ein weiteres mal abschreiben müssen. Auf der Suche nach leerem Papier erwachte ich nun wirklich und bemerkte, dass ich von dem Traum noch garnichts aufgeschrieben hatte. (473 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3408 (1994-11-06, 01:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte ausgeliehen verschiedene Bände eines Lexikons mit Grundrissen von Kirchenbauten. Kleine Taschenbuchbände waren es, die ich nun zurückgeben wollte. Ein Mann, der im selben Hause arbeitete, wo ich sie ausgeliehen hatte, ein Kunsthistoriker, hatte die Bände bei mir gesehen und mich gefragt, ob ich sie ihm geben könne, wenn ich sie fertig benutzt hätte. Ich fragte nun den Leiter der Institution, wo ich sie ausgeliehen hatte, ob ich es so machen könne, und sagte, dass es dafür zwei Wege gäbe, nämlich, dass ich sie direkt in sein Zimmer legen würde, oder zuerst offiziell zurückgeben. Er sagte, ich solle doch das erstere machen, weil es am einfachsten sei. Ich tat es und begann nun, einen Artikel über die vier Kirchen zu schreiben, derentwegen ich die Bände ausgeliehen hatte und deren Grundrisse ich wohl aus den Bänden kopiert hatte. Ich schrieb dass es sich bei diesen vier Kirchen nicht nur um besonders berühmte Kirchen dieser Stadt handle, sondern um vier der berühmtesten Kirchen der Welt überhaupt. So weit ich mich erinnere, waren es die Kirchen "San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane" von Borromini in Rom.,die Asamskirche in München, die Kirche St. Stephen Wallbrook von Christopher Wren in London und eine reine Ovaklkirche, wohl die Kirche Weltenburg von den Brüdern Asam. Ich sah beim, Schreiben die vier Grundrisse und ihr Spiel mit Kreis und Quadrat, Oval und Rechteck vor meinem geistigen Auge. Sie waren alle vier Kirchen der Stadt, in der auch das Institut war, in dem ich jetzt die Bücher zurückgegeben, beziehungsweise weiter gegeben hatte. (253 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3409 (1994-11-07, 00:30 - Zürich)Ich traf Christian v. Ferber, der hier in Zürich war, um uns zu besuchen. Ich fragte ihn, ob er wisse, dass Herr Bie, der im Traum einer unserer früheren Lehrer war, in der Gegend sei. Er sagte, ja das wisse er, denn er müsse ihn ja heute nachmittag hier in Zürich treffen. Insofern sei sein Besuch bei uns ja gleichsam gar kein ganz richtiger Besuch, weil er teilweise andere Verpflichtungen wie diese habe. Dann wurde daraus die Situation eines Vortrags oder Kongresses, bei dem ich hörte, dass am Nachmittag Martin Buber hier sprechen werde. Ich war erstaunt, denn ich wusste garnicht, dass Buber noch lebte, beschloss aber, hin zu gehen. Dann wurde daraus die Situation, dass jemand seltene Bücher von Buber verkaufte, die aber nun schon alle waren. Schliesslich sagte er, dass er doch noch eines habe, dass er mir verkaufen konnte. Es kostete aber sechzig Mark, was mir etwas viel erschien. Dann wieder eine andere Szene: Ich war jetzt in der Universität und wollte eine Antrittsvorlesung eines Mitgliedes der Philosophischen Fakultät besuchen. Ich fand auch den Ort, wo offensichtlich die Kleider der Mitglieder der Fakultät lagen, Mäntel und Schals und ähnliches, fand aber den Raum nicht, wo der Vortrag selbst stattfand. Es gab verschiedene Türen, die von einem langen Gang abgingen, hinter denen man jemand reden hörte. Wenn man aber eine dieser Türen öffnete und vorsichtig hineinhorchte, merkte man, dass es sich um eine Vorlesung aus einem ganz anderen Bereich als dem der Philosophischen Fakultät handelte. Das wiederholte sich mehrfach. Schliesslich bemerkte ich, dass hinter dem Raum, in dem die Kleider lagen, noch ein anderer Raum war, in dem offenbar die Antrittsvorlesung stattfand. Ich hörte einen Professor namens Beat von Matt, einen Germanisten, den ich kannte, dort sprechen. Ich wunderte mich, denn er war schon seit langem Fakultätsmitglied. Ich blieb aber doch dort, denn der Vortrag war interessant. Er las einzelne Gedichte oder Stücke von Geschichten eines Autors vor, machte aber dazwischen ganz lange Pausen, die jeweils länger waren als die Phasen des Vorlesens. Das gab der Sache etwas sehr Entspannendes und Nachdenkliches. Man war in diesen langen Pausen sozusagen zum Nachdenken angeregt. Ich wachte auf und hörte Emme neben mir im Schlaf sehr gleichmässig und mit längeren Pausen atmen, wie es sich anhören kann, wenn jemand tief schläft. Man konnte darin den Rhythmus der Pausen und des Sprechens im Traum wiedererkennen. (393 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3410 (1994-11-08, 04:00 - Zürich)Wir waren in einer grossen Halle, in der eine Art Schwimmvorführung sattfand. Dafür war vorne auf der Bühne ein grosses Bassin aufgebaut, in dem Mädchen Schwimmvorführungen machten. Die Wand war aus durchsichtigem Glas, so dass man sie sehen konnte. Wir als Zuschauer sassen auf Stuhlreihen wie in einem Konzertsaal. Nach der Pause war etwas verändert. Man sah, dass das Becken jetzt auch über uns hinwegreichte, indem die Glaswand in der Höhe waagerecht über uns hingezogen war, so dass das Becken sich in der Höhe über die ganze Halle ausweitete. Und hier sah man nun die Mädchen entlangschwimmen, so dass man sie von unten über sich wegschwimmen sah und ihre Schwimmbewegungen beobachten konnte. Es sah sehr hübsch aus. Es waren auch zwei schwarze Mädchen bei den Schwimmerinnen, die aber nachher nicht mehr da waren. Die anderen waren alle weiss. Dafür waren jetzt plötzlich bei uns zwei ganz kleine schwarze Negerpuppen, wie die Kinder sie zum Spielen hatten. Offenbar waren das die beiden schwarzen Mädchen, die eigentlich verwandelte Puppen waren und irgendwie aus dem Becken herausgekommen und in Puppen zurückverwandelt waren. Sie waren nur wenige Zentimeter gross. Eine von ihnen, sie gelangten etwas nacheinander zu uns, irgendjemand hatte sie weiter gereicht - eine von ihnen war von Zucker klebrig, als wenn ein Kind mit ihr gespielt hätte. Ich wusch sie unter einem Wasserhahn, der hinter mir war. Wir sassen am Rande der Halle und es war zugleich wie unserer Wohnung, in der wir wohnten. Ich sagte mir, dass die beiden bei der Organisation der Vorführung vermisst werden würden, und schickte darum Tobi, damit er die beiden Puppen dorthin bringen solle. Später machte ich mir Gedanken, ob er sie auch wirklich abgegeben und den Auftrag richtig verstanden hätte, denn sonst würde man sich Gedanken über das Verschwinden der beiden schwarzen Mädchen machen. Dann wachte ich langsam auf. (304 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3412 (1994-11-10, 03:00 - Zürich)Wir wohnten in einem alten Haus, das in seiner inneren Struktur teilweise meinem Elternhaus in Schwerin, aber auch dem Haus von Emmis Mutter in der Werderstrasse 38 und anderen Häusern glich. So hatte es zum Beispiel ein anderes Treppenhaus als diese beiden Häuser. Das Haus war von seinen ursprünglichen Mietern verlassen worden und jetzt in viele kleine Einheiten aufgeteilt. So wohnten wir zum Beispiel in zwei ineinander gehenden Räumen, die in der Lage den beiden Wohnzimmern meiner Eltern glichen. Aber wir hatten dort kein Wasser und ich suchte, um etwas zu trinken einen Wasserhahn, den ich aber nicht gleich fand. Ich vermutete etwas in einem hinteren Winkel eines um die Ecke gehenden Ganges, wo aber zwei Räume wie Toiletten oder Duschräume abegschlossen zu sein schienen, weil sie zu einer anderen Wohneinheit gehörten. Als ich gerade die Tür probieren wollte, kam auch dem grossen Zimmer, das eine Art Flügeltür hatte und in der Lage meinem Kinderzimmer, dem früheren Schlafzimmer meiner Eltern glich, ein Mann, der dort wohnte. Zu ihm schienen die beiden kleinen Nebenräume zu gehören, zu denen ich mich gerade geschlichen hatte und die ich darum schnell wieder verliess. Später sah ich durch das Treppenhaus gehend, dass überall kleine Wohneinheiten, in die die alten Wohnungen aufgeteilt waren,m nur provisorisch möbliert waren. Meist sah man durch die einen Spalt offenstehenden Türen nur einen grauen Filzfussboden, ein altmodisch aussehendes Holzbett, das mit einer ebenfalls dunkelgrauen Decke abgedeckt war und vielleicht einen Holztisch. Es wohnten auch Asiaten in den Zimmern, die nur vorübergehend da zu sein schienen. In manchen der Räume lagen auch Papierschnitzel und ander Sachen unordentlich auf den grauen Filzböden herum. Das Haus hatte hier um das Treppenhaus herum eher die Züge des Hauses von Emmis Mutter aber auch wohl vieler andrer alter Häuser, die ich im Lauge des Lebens gesehen habe. (301 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3417 (1994-11-13, 22:00 - Freiburg)Ein Dieb hatte sich durch einen Trick Zugang in unsere Wohnung verschafft, indem er behauptete, er käme im Auftrag meiner Schwester Adelheid, um Schallplatten aus unserer Schallplattensammlung, die ihr gehörten, abzuholen. Die Kinder, die nicht wussten, dass das nicht stimmte, hatten ihn eingelassen. Nur durch Zufall kamen wir früher von einer Reise zurück und ertappten ihn auf frischer Tat. Er kam gerade mit einem verschlossenen Koffer, den er auf einer Art Schiebkarre wie auf Schienen vor sich hinschob, durch den Flur der Wohnung auf uns zu. Er behauptete, er habe vier Platten mit Barockmusik, es handelte sich um Trompetenkonzerte mit Maurice André, die meiner Schwester gehörten, an sich genommen. Ich sagte ihm, dass alle Platten in dieser Sammlung uns selbst gehörten. Er hatte noch grosssprecherisch gesagt, dass alle Platten unzureichend verpackt gewesen seien und er sie in ein festes Gefäss verpackt hätte. Ich erwachte erregt und überlegte noch im Erwachen, dass man ihn zwingen müsse, den Koffer zu öffnen, da man nicht wissen konnte, was er alles eingepackt hatte. Ich erwachte mit einem Fiebergefühl, das ich beim Einschlafen schon gehabt hatte, weshalb ich mich frühzeitig schlafen gelegt hatte. Die Kinder waren in dem Traum noch klein. Die Platten von Maurice André waren solche, aus denen ich Stücke schon in Vorlesungen zur Ausdruckspsychologie vorgespielt hatte und die ich sehr liebe. Der Mann wirkte wie ein alter Herr, ich überlegte aber, ob er sich nicht nur so geschminkt habe. (237 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3419 (1994-11-14, 05:00 - Freiburg)Beim Ausziehen ordnen sich meine Kleider wie von selbst zu Mandalafiguren an der Wand. Andere Szene: Dinge, die sich beim Aufräumen nicht richtig einordnen lassen, so gesammelte Steine und Holzstücke, die Emme zum Schnitzen aufgehoben hat, darunter solche, die noch nass sind, dann merkwürdige Figuren in der Gestalt wie Schneemänner oder Götzenfiguren aus einem Material, das einerseits wie Holz zu sein scheint, andererseits weich und noch feucht, teilweise auch in Tücher eingeschlagen. Es stellt sich heraus, dass es noch unfertige Figuren sind, die zur Zeit des Baues des Hauses um 1870 aus einer Frucht geschnitzt wurden und erstaunlicher Weise noch heute feucht sind trotz der mehr als hundert Jahre, die inzwischen vergangen sind. Es muss sich dabei um riesen-grosse tropische Früchte gehandelt haben, weil die Figuren gross sind. Auch sie lassen sich beim Aufräumen nicht richtig einordnen. So versuche ich einmal, Haufen von allen den Gegenständen zu machen, die noch nass sind. Dann steht da ein grosser Flügel an der Wand, von dem wir nicht wissen, wo er her ist. Erst dachten wir, er gehöre Markus. Dann zeigt sich aber, dass das nicht stimmt, und jemand sagt, Dieter Sträuli habe ihn einmal irgendwoher gebracht. Emme sagt, dass wir ihn wegräumen wollen, weil wir dann viel Platz gewinnen. Er kommt mir aber sehr vertraut und selbstverständlich vor, ist sogar mit der selben persischen Decke zugedeckt aus leichtem leuchtend gelbem Stoff wie der Flügel im Elternhaus und steht auch genau an der analogen Stelle im Zimmer an der Wand. wie dort. Vorher noch andere Szene, wo ich Räume in der Universität entdecke, die ich garnicht kannte, an deren Türen aber mein Name steht. Dieter Sträuli sagt, ich brauche sie jetzt noch nicht leer zu räumen, denn es sind noch irgend welche Unisachen von mir darin. Andere werden schon von den Assistenten des Nachfolgers gebraucht.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3421 (1994-11-16, 07:00 - Zürich)Wir hatten einen Sohn im Alter am Ende der Pubertätszeit oder Adoleszenz, des sich sehr aufrührig und eigenwillig gebärdete und renitent war. Ich hörte, als ich im Wohnzimmer war, einen Krach eines umfallenden Gegenstandes und sah auf den Flur tretend, dass er den Long-Chair von Charles Eames, der auf dem Flur vor dem wandhohen Spiegel stand, umgeworfen hatte, wobei auch noch die Gefahr bestanden hatte, dass der grosse Spiegel zertrümmert wurde. Ich trat wütend in sein Zimmer, das im Traum in der sonst der Wirklichkeit ähnlichen Wohnung auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite in der Gegend der Küche und des Badezimmers,war, und stellte ihn zur Rede, obwohl das Zimmer voll von anderen jungen Männern seines Alters war, die alle verwegen angezogen und bärtig waren. Da er wegschaute, sagte ich energisch: "Schau mir ins Gesicht", was er dann, eigentlich zu meiner Verwunderung, auch tat. Es schien mir, dass zu meinem Erstaunen er und auch die anderen Anwesenden meine Vorwürfe gegen seine Unvernunft berechtigt fanden. Dann wachte ich auf und vergass zunächst den Traum. Erst als ich in die Badewanne stieg, fiel er mir in allen Einzelheiten wieder ein. (185 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3424 (1994-11-17, 06:30 - Zürich)Emme war irgendwohin unterwegs und ich war allein in der Wohnung, die eine andere war als in der Wirklichkeit. Als sie am Abend noch nicht zurück war, legte ich mich schlafen. Als ich gegen morgen aufwachte, war sie immer noch nicht da. Dann aber hörte ich sie irgendwoher Gedichte rezitieren. Ich rannte hinaus, die Wohnung schien aber leer zu sein. Das Zimmer war jetzt plötzlich verschlossen. ich schloss die Tür auf, sah sie aber nirgends, auch nicht im Treppenhaus, als ich die Wohnungstür öffnete, hörte sie aber immer noch Gedichte rezitieren. Ich lief dem Klang nach und fand sie schliesslich als Schlaf-Em auf dem Balkon bei dem Versuch, dort in die obere Etage zu klettern. Sie war offensichtlich schon als Schlaf-Em nach Hause gekommen. Ich zog sie zurück, hielt sie fest und umarmte sie. Sie sagte immer noch in Gedichtform etwas, ich hätte sie verletzt. Dann wachte sie auf und rief erstaunt. "Was ist los?" Dann wachte ich auf und Emme lag in ihren Bett neben mir. (167 words)

Er läuft umher und springt und hüpft, wobei er, wie es Kinder tun, dabei auch ab und zu hinfällt, auf die Nase fällt, und ich ihm wieder aufhelfen muss. Andere Szene. Ich gehe mit Hans Biäsch im Wald spazieren, der aber hier im Traum ein alter Mann ist, der zwei Beinprothesen hat, mit diesen aber unermüdlich hüpft und springt, auch Sport treibt und eine ungeheure Vitalität entwickelt hat. Da er aber ein alter Mann ist, ist er doch in Gefahr, hinzufallen, und ich muss ihn auffangen. Er hat aber eine erstaunliche Fähigkeit entwickelt, mit den beiden Prothesen das Gleichgewicht zu halten. Es ist auch noch ein anderer Mann bei dem Spaziergang dabei, mit dem er irgendwo oberhalb eines kleinen Abhanges am Waldrand sitzt, so hinter Bäumen, dass ich ihn zuerst nicht wiederfinden kann. Er macht sich dann aber wieder auf den Weg und läuft schnell, so dass unsere Wege gleich wieder zusammen führen. Im Hintergrund hört man aus einem Haus am Waldrand Tinas Stimme, die dort bei Leuten zu Besuch ist und mit ihnen etwas in der Küche macht. (186 words)

Das war das Ende einer Rede, die ich nach kurzem Einnicken in der Badewanne erwachend gerade noch hörte. Die Worte "... irrsinnig ist" waren das Ende eines Satzes, der wohl mit dem Relativsatz "was irrsinnig ist" schloss. Die Worte "Viel Glück!" waren dann eine verabschiedende Grussformel des Sprechenden. (57 words)

An einer Stelle ist die auch sehr natürlich aussehende Haut am rechten Arm der Puppe rissig geworden und teilweise aufgeplatzt. Ich denke, dass man sie dort entfernen muss, um sie zu erneueren, und beginne damit, sie dort abzumachen. Plötzlich wird mir bewusst, dass wir garnicht die Materialien haben, um sie zu ersetzen, und dass es viel besser ist, sie dran zu lassen. Ich überlege, ob ich die schon abgemachten Stücke noch wieder richtig zusammensetzen und wieder richtig dran machen kann, und wache dabei sehr beunruhigt auf, noch im Aufwachen verschiedene Methoden überlegend, wie man das machen könnte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3429 (1994-11-19, 06:30 - Zürich)Ich liege noch im Bett, merke, dass es schon spät ist, und frage Emme, die gerade liest: "Was ist die Uhr?" "Zehn vor Zwei", sagt sie. In diesem Moment fällt mir ein, dass ich um viertel nach zwei ein Seminar in der Uni habe. Es ist das erste im Semester. Ich rufe Emme laut zu: "Um viertel nach zwei habe ich ein Seminar, um viertel nach zwei", die Zeit wiederholend, damit sie es realisiert. Sie blickt vom Lesen auf, realisiert es nur langsam. Ich beginne, mich anzuziehen und sage: "Kannst Du mir ein Taxi rufen? Wie spät ist es jetzt?" Sie sagt "Acht Minuten vor zwei". Ich überlege, dass es vielleicht gerade noch reichen kann, und stelle mir, mich weiter anziehend, die Situation vor. Ich werde dort auch meinen neuen Assistenten sehen, den ich noch garnicht kenne, also auch nicht erkenne. Aber er kennt mich ja. Referatthemen muss ich auch vergeben. Aber dafür ist nichts vorbereitet. Vielleicht kann man das auf die nächste Sitzung verschieben. Ein hochbeiniger Stuhl, auf dem ich vor den vielen Leuten wie immer sitzen kann, ist vielleicht auch nicht da. Aber ich könnte mich auf den Tisch setzten. Wenn ich mich ganz schnell anziehe und runter laufe und das Taxi schnell kommt, könnte es vielleicht noch reichen. Aber rasiert bin ich auch noch nicht. Bei der Überlegung, ob es dafür auch noch reichen könnte, erwache ich. (230 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3430 (1994-11-20, 07:00 - Zürich)Ich ging an einem Gebäude mit glatter steinerner Mauerhülle, das etwas dem Sockelbau des Zürcher Kunsthauses glich, entlang auf der Suche nach, glaube ich, einer Telephonzelle. Schliesslich öffnete ich eine in die Mauer eingelassene steinerne Tür, hinter der aber ein Mann sass, der sich in diese Zelle, wohl einen Schrank für irgendwelche Schaltungen, gehockt hatte, um sein Geschäft zu verrichten, da er offenbar keine Toilette hatte finden können. Ich entschuldigte mich und versuchte, die Tür wieder zu schliessen, die aber nicht mehr in ihr Schloss einschnappte. Darum sagte ich zu dem Mann, er müsse sie von innen zuziehen, und ging auf meiner Suche weiter und erwachte mit Bauchschmerzen und einer stark verspannten Magendecke. Ich vergass den Traum, und er fiel mir erst in der Badewanne wieder ein. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3431 (1994-11-21, 03:45 - Zürich)Ich lebe in einer Welt, die bedrohlich und gefährlich geworden ist. Unsichere Elemente sind auf der Strasse. Frauen haben sich mittelalterlich anmutende Waffen gekauft, um alle Männer zu bekämpfen. So treten mir zwei Frauen mit einer Art Schlaginstrument entgegen. Ich rufe ihnen zu, sie sollen doch vernünftig sein und sich normal verhalten, worauf sie ihre Waffen sinken lassen. Dann in einer Strasse, in der das Haus ist, in dem ich wohne, tritt mir nachts ein Mann entgegen, der mit undurchschaubar drohenden Gebärden irgend etwas fordert. Schliesslich merke ich, dass er hochgehoben oder gestützt werden will, um jemand, der oben wohnt, ein bedrohendes Plakat ans Fenster kleben zu können. Er lässt aber dann von der Sache ab, weil das Fenster zu hoch ist. In einem unbeobachteten Moment springe ich zur Haustür des Hauses daneben herein, in dem ich wohne. Die Tür ist offen. Ich überlege, ob ich sie abschliessen soll, lasse es aber dann, weil ja dann Leute, die uns besuchen wollen, nicht hineinkönnen. Der Türgriff ist mit einem weissen Tempotuch umwickelt. Ich selbst habe das getan, damit man die Tür nachts leise öffnen und schliessen kann. Ich lasse es dran und beginne nun, die Treppe hoch zu steigen. Ich mache mir klar, dass mein Zimmer ziemlich abseits liegt und deshalb wohl nicht von eindringenden anarchistischen Leuten gefährdet ist. Ich bin mir plötzlich nicht mehr klar, wie ich die verwickelten Treppenläufe hoch gehen muss, die zu meinem Zimmer führen. Alle Treppen sind ohne Geländer. Die Baumgärtnerin, die in diesem Haus meine Wirtin ist, ruft: "Wer ist denn da?" Ich bin froh, eine bekannte Stimme zu hören, und rufe zurück: "Das ist der Dellev". Dann wache ich auf. (276 words)

Ich bin etwas beunruhigt darüber, sage mir aber, dass, wenn ich den einen ihm zu geben bereit bin, er eigentlich ja auch genau so gut die anderen auch lesen kann, die ihn echt zu interessieren scheinen, worüber ich mich freue, denn er ist sehr in die Lektüre vertieft.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3433 (1994-11-22, 03:45 - Zürich)Ich war bei einem Kongress. Die Professoren fuhren Strassenbahn, wobei sie selbst die Strassenbahnfahrer und ihre Sekretärinnen die Schaffnerinnen waren. Das gehörte mit zur Organisation des Kongresses. Dann gab es zu bestimmten Blockzeiten an bestimmten Orten Vorträge oder Seminare. Ich sass mit einem Begleiter, wohl meinem Bruder, mit dem ich auch im selben Zimmer wohnte, in einer solchen Strassenbahn und sprach mit ihm darüber, wie originell es sei, wenn die Professoren Strassenbahnführer sind. Dann wollte ich nachsehen, zu welcher Zeit ich heute, es war am frühen Nachmittag, an welchem Ort sein müsse, um einen Vortrag oder ein Seminar zu halten, und welches das Thema sei. Ich meinte, es sei etwas Philosophisches. Dann bemerkte ich zu meinem Schrecken, dass ich meine blaue Liberty-Tasche, in der alle Papiere und auch Geld und Zimmerschlüssel waren, nicht bei mir hatte. Ich musste sie entweder beim Essen im Lokal stehen gelassen haben, oder schon zu Hause. Ich musste also zurück und sie suchen. Die Schwierigkeit war aber, dass ich ja weder Geld noch Schlüssel bei mir hatte. Ich glaube, um vier begannen die Kurse. Ich fragte meinen Begleiter, jetzt war es wohl Emme, wieviel Uhr es sei. Die Antwort war "Halbdrei". Bei der Überlegung, wie ich jetzt weiter vorgehen solle, erwachte ich. Ich sah nach der Uhr und es war 3 Uhr 45 in der Nacht. Es fallen mir noch die Räumlichkeiten ein, die in dem Traum eine Rolle spielten: Das war ein Universitätskomplex, ein weiteres Gebäude, etwa wie eine Schule, und ein Gebäude mit Säulen im Weinbrennerstil, vielleicht ein Institut oder ähnliches.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3435 (1994-11-23, 05:45 - Zürich)Traum, in dem Mandalafigur und Leiblichkeit irgendwie vereinigt sind. Es ist wie ein immer tieferes Eindringen, in dem jedes Durchdringen einer weiteren Hülle auf dem Weg ins Innere ein Eindringen in eine tiefere Mandalafigur ist, die wie Wände eines Hauses umeinandergelegt oder konzentrisch ineinander gelegt sind. Es ist also ein dreidimensionales Mandala wie ein Haus, das zugleich der Leib ist. Dann bin ich aufgewacht, aber im Traum, und will den Traum aufschreiben. Zuerst finde ich einen Bleistift aber kein Papier, sondern nur ein Gefäss, eine längliche Schale, auf deren Boden ich zu schreiben versuche. Die Schrift haftet aber wenig. Ich beginne mit dem Satz: "Was sind Mandalafiguren wirklich?". Dann finde ich die Computertastatur meines Reisecomputers und beschliesse nun, den Traum damit aufzuschreiben. Zuerst nehme ich meine Brille aus dem Etui und setze sie auf. Aber nun kommen Leute in den Raum Es sind die Gastgeber und auch meine Familie, die eine Art Festfrühstück vorbereiten wollen in dem Raum, der an den, in dem ich schlafe angrenzt. Es ist offenbar ein Festtag. Sie müssen alle durch den Raum, in dem ich liege, hindurchgehen, um in den anderen zu kommen. Wenn ich nun dort auf dem Computer schreibe, während sie an der Vorbereitung des Frühstücks arbeiten, sieht das merkwürdig aus und nicht zur Rolle des Gastes passend. Schreiben mit der Hand würde da weniger auffallen und weniger störend wirken. Bei diesen Überlegungen wache ich auf, immer noch den Traum mir in der Erinnerung einprägend, und begreife erst allmählich, dass ich ihn nun wirklich mit dem Computer aufschreiben kann, wozu ich aber aufstehen muss.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3436 (1994-11-24, 06:15 - Zürich)Jemand hat eine Landkarte gefunden, von der ich vermute, dass es eine alte sehr wertvolle Karte ist. Der Name David Herrliberger fällt in diesem Zusammenhang. Es ist eine Karte in Aufrisszeichnung, in der man Häuser und Hügel und Täler sieht. Sie scheint mir aber noch älter als die Karten Herrlibergers zu sein. In einer anderen Szene spricht mich jemand, eine Frau oder Mädchen, auf ein Buch an mit sehr interessanten Artikeln, das sie "Euer Buch" nennt, weil es im Institut herausgegeben sei. Es heisst offenbar "Judentum und Christentum" und enthält verschiedene Artikel über dieses Thema. Ich versuche der Gesprächspartnerin, die ich auf dem Limmatquai in der Nähe des Central getroffen habe, klar zu machen, dass ich ja nicht mehr ins Institut komme, weil meine Vorlesungen ja direkt in der Uni sind.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3437 (1994-11-25, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich will meine Grösse messen und habe dazu ein zusammenklappbares, aber festes Zentimetermass bei mir, das ich ganz auseinander klappe und neben mich halte. Da es aber so für mich schwer abzulesen ist, bitte ich einen von vielen dastehenden Leuten, mir zu helfen. Wir finden einen Platz an der weiss gemalten Wand, wo ich mich hinstellen kann, so dass er das Mass dort anlegen kann. Es ist ein Platz gerade bei der Garderobe, wo ich immer stehe, wenn ich den Mantel an- oder ausziehe. Ich gebe ihm einen flachen Drahtkleiderbügel von der Garderobe, den er auf der Höhe meines Kopfes zum Messen an die Wand halten Kann. Er stellt sich aber sehr umständlich an und will unbedingt dort an der Wand einen Strich in meiner Höhe machen. Ich denke. dass ein kleiner Bleistiftstrich wohl nicht stören werde, sehe aber zu meiner Bestürzung, dass es einen Kugelschreiber nimmt und immer weiter den Strich nachzieht. Es ist ein blauer Kugelschreiber, und ich trete sofort von der Wand weg und bitte ihn, aufzuhören. Er arbeitet aber wie besessen daran weiter und ich ziehe schliesslich seine Hand mit dem Kugelschreiber weg von der Wand, wobei die Hand gleichsam einen Widerstand bietet wie etwas, was schwer von der Wand abzubiegen ist. Der Strich, den er gemacht hat, ist nicht gerade, sondern folgt ein kleines Stück weit gebogen der Umrisslinie meines Kopfes. Am höchsten Punkt dieser Linie hat er dann zusätzlich einen geraden waagerechten Strich gezogen und den dabei entstehenden Zwischenraum auch noch blau gestrichelt. Er gibt als gemessene Grösse 1,09 Meter an, was mir irgendwie unwahrscheinlich vorkommt, ohne dass ich sofort durchschaue, dass das ja die Grösse eines kleinen Kindes wäre. Ich überlege, wie ich den Strich von der weissen Rauhputztapetenwand wegbringen soll, ob ich es mit weisser Farbe oder mit Tippex versuchen soll, und erwache sehr beunruhigt. Der Strich an der Wand im Traum befand sich in meiner wirklichen Höhe von etwa 180 Zentimetern. (320 words)

Man hatte gesagt, dass man sich zusätzlich zweimal im Semester träfe, um diese Kurse zu besprechen. Das schien mir noch erträglich. Nun aber kam ein schriftliches Programm, wo eine ganze grössere Reihe von solchen zusätzlichen Treffen vorgesehen war. Das war mir zu viel. Ich überlegte, was ich tun solle und dass ich dort anrufen müsse und wenn nötig lieber den ganzen Kurs streichen, als so viele solche Besprechungen zu machen, von denen man sowieso nicht recht wusste, was sie sollten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3439 (1994-11-26, 06:30 - Zürich)Ich ging durch eine Stadt ähnlich wie Venedig, dabei irgendwie auf der Suche nach Markus. Schliesslich ging ich in ein Hotel und dort in eine Zimmer und plötzlich stand Markus hier hinter mir. Es war erstaunlich, dass er gerade in dem Haus und Zimmer war, in das ich durch Zufall geraten war, andererseits suchte ich ihn in dieser Gegend, eigentlich im angebauten Nachbarhaus. Es waren auch viele andere Leute in dem Zimmer, in dem eine Art bohemienhafte Unordnung war. Er sagte: "Ich arbeite hier für das Gewerbe dieser Frau". Es war auch eine Frau da, die igendetwas wohl mit dem Theater zu tun zu haben schien. Vielleicht war das das Gewerbe. Der Ausdruck vom ältesten Gewerbe beschäftigte mich, aber das war offenbar nicht gemeint. Dann fand ich in dem Zimmer ein Buch, das ich durchblätterte. Hinten fand ich schliesslich eine Widmung in schon verblasster rötlicher Schrift. "Meiner lieben Frau, Dieter Hasselblatt". Es war deutlich erkennbar Dieter Hasselblatts charakteristische Schrift. Ich zeigte das Buch Emme, die jetzt auch da war, und sagte, welch erstaunlicher Zufall es sei, dass gerade hier gerade dieses Buch läge. Es stand auch eine Jahreszahl bei der Widmung, nämlich 1953, und ein Ort namens Grauhaus. Emme sagte: "Ja, ja. in Grauhaus waren die damals". Dann war ich wieder auf dem Weg durch die Stadt. Jetzt war es Zürich am See in der Gegend der Sechseläutenwiese, aber irgend wie verändert. Viele Fahrbahnen am See, die man vorsichtig überqueren musste. Ich ging schliesslich auf einem schmalen Fussgängerstreifen und hörte aus einem Lautsprecher eines Karussell- und Vernnügungsgeländes Markus's Stimme, der etwas ansagte, war aber nicht ganz sicher, ob es wirklich seine Stimme sei, und erwachte.

Dann kamen die Leute ins Zimmer und Emme stellte mir drei junge Männer vor, die Kriminalkommissare seien. Einer von diesen versuchte, mir eine Art von Taschendiebstahl zu erklären, wo der Dieb den Leuten von oben in die Hosentasche fasst und das lose darin befindliche Geld hinausnimmt. Um das zu zeigen schüttete er bei seiner langen und umständlichen Erklärung auch eine Schüttelbörse auf den Boden aus und begann dann, das Geld dort aufzusammeln. Das Ganze sollte offensichtlich darauf hinauslaufen, mich einer solchen Art des Taschendiebstahls zu beschuldigen. Ich hatte schon vorher davon gehört, weswegen seine lange und umständliche Erklärung besonders merkwürdig wirkte. Einer der anderen beiden Männer wollte ihm ins Wort fallen, um die Sache kürzer und besser zu erklären. Er sagte aber zu ihm: "Bitte lass mich machen". Ich wachte verärgert und mit Kopfweh auf und wollte den Traum mit der absurden Beschuldigung zuerst nicht aufschreiben. (179 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3442 (1994-11-29, 04:15 - Zürich)Wir hatten ein Gartengelände anzulegen. Zunächst war es ein grosses Gelände, das von zwei Eisenbahnlinien durchschnitten wurde, die schräg aufeinander zu liefen. Ich konnte das Gelände durchqueren, ohne die Schienen zu überschreiten, indem ich in der Mittellinie zwischen den beiden Eisenbahnen geradeaus zur anderen Seite des Gartens ging, wo ich etwas zu tun hatte. Dann war es ein kleineres Gelände, jetzt ohne die Eisenbahnen, aber ich war weiterhin zuerst auf dem hinteren Rand beschäftigt, der wohl, ähnlich wie unser Schweriner Garten, an einer Art Böschung endete. Es ging auch darum, dort am Rand etwas wie eine hohe Stange aufzurichten. Als der Garten schon ziemlich weit gediehen war, war noch ein Tannenbaum zu pflanzen, wofür ein Platz in der Nähe des Randes vorgesehen war, wo er möglichst wenig Land beschatten würde. Dann kam der junge Unterbewohner, ergriff den Baum, ohne auf alle unsere Überlegungen einzugehen, und wollte ihn genau in den Mittelpunkt des rechteckigen Gartens pflanzen. Er tat das gleichsam ohne lange Besinnung und ohne die Folgen zu bedenken. Ich rief aus, dass er hier alles beschatten würde, und ausserdem wurde mir klar, dass er dort sich überallhin mit seinen flachen Wurzeln ausdehnen und nichts dort wachsen würde. Ich überlegte, ob ich nicht sagen sollte: "Brauchen wir überhaupt einen Tannenbaum?" und erwachte. (211 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3444 (1994-11-30, 01:45 - Zürich)Wir hatten wieder unsere alte Wohnung, gleichsam die in Freiburg. Es war wie diese eine Altbauwohnung aber gleichsam viel grösser und geräumiger. Die Wohnung war noch wenig möbliert. Es war Nacht und ich tastete mich zu meinem Bett. Emme sagte, aus dem Schlaf aufwachend, ich habe Socken von mir oder jemand anders in ihre Socken getan. Es handelte sich um frisch gewaschene schwarze Socken in einem Korb. Ich erinnerte mich, dass mir andersartige Socken darin aufgefallen waren und ich tastete im Dunklen danach, um sie dort herauszunehmen, wobei ich dachte, dass ich sie auch mit dem Tastgefühl würde unterscheiden können. Das Gefühl, dass es schön sei, die alte Wohnung zurückbekommen zu haben und neu einrichten zu können, war angenehm und freundlich in dem Traum. (124 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3445 (1994-11-30, 06:15 - Zürich)Toscanini dirigierte. Toscanini war in dem Traum eine Frau. Am Ende des Konzertes dirigierte sie noch, gleichsam zur Übung, ein Stück von Stravinsky. Es war ungeheuer überzeugend, lebendig und aus einem Stück. Ich sagte das zu ihr. Sie antwortete, es sei garnicht gut gewesen. Ich sagte, es sei aber viel besser und überzeugender als das vorher Dirigierte gewesen. Sie liess sich aber nicht abbringen davon, dass es schlecht gewesen sei, und sagte herablassend, dass sie schon so viel und überall in der Welt dirigiert habe, und wollte damit ausdrücken, dass ich gar keine echten Vergleichsmöglichkeiten hätte, da ich sie ja nur hier gehört hatte. Ich ärgerte mich darüber, fand aber zugleich, dass ich mich mehr auf mein Ohr verlassen müsse als auf ihre Reden. Dann war ich in der Oper. Sass im obersten Rang zwischen einem jungen Mann, mit dem ich wohl zusammen dahin gegangen war, etwa einem meiner früheren Assistenten, und einem alten Mann, der eher zerstreut war. Ein Mantel oder ähnliches fiel ihm herunter. Ich hob es auf und gab es ihm. Er sagte aber nicht danke, wie es normal gewesen wäre. Später beim Weggehen, liess er eine kleine Ledertasche liegen. Ich hob sie auf, um sie ihm nachzutragen. Da kam er zurück, weil er es inzwischen selbst bemerkt hatte. Ich gab sie ihm in die Hand. Er sagte wieder nichts, drehte sich um und ging. Ich sagte zu dem jungen Mann. "Dem ist das Wort Danke abhanden gekommen". Er antwortete. "Schade für ihn". Bei dieser Antwort imponierte mir die Lässigkeit, mit der sie gegeben war, die nicht Ärger ausdrückte, sondern nur Bedauern für den, der ja selbst am meisten darunter zu leiden haben würde. Vorher hatte ich mir Sandalen angezogen, die ich bei mir hatte. Es waren solche, die ich vor vielen Jahren getragen hatte. Sie waren schwarz und mit ziemlich dicken Sohlen und hatten vorne eine Art Netz, in das man die Zehen hineinschieben musste, sassen aber ausserordentlich bequem und der Fuss fühlte sich leicht und frei darin. Das fand ich auch jetzt, als ich am Ende der Oper von dem Sitz aufstand. Ich hatte verschiedene Gegenstände, auch verschiedene Ledertaschen, mitzunehmen und konzentrierte mich, damit es mir nicht ginge wie dem Mann neben mir, der seine Tasche vergessen hatte. Ich sagte zu dem anderen, der noch da war, dass es am besten sei, wenn ich jetzt einen Plastikbeutel hätte, in den ich sie alle hineintuen könne, denn es war schwierig, auf dem langen Weg die Treppen herab, all die Taschen richtig in der Hand zu behalten. Ich hatte mich mit Emme am Eingang der Oper verabredet, wo sie mich abholen wollte. Die Logenschliesserin sagte nun: "Bitte den Eingang P7" benutzen. Alle anderen Ausgänge aus dem Foyer, die ins Innere des Hauses führten, hatten sie schon geschlossen, und ich sah, dass dieser Ausgang "P7" in eine Aussentreppe führte, die nicht beim Haupteingang endete, wo Emme auf mich wartete, sondern in einem Nebenausgang an der Seite des Opernhauses. Ich würde also draussen auf der Strasse um das Opernhaus herumgehen müssen, um Emme am Haupteingang zu treffen, und sie würde also länger warten müssen. Bei diesen Überlegungen wachte ich auf.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3446 (1994-12-01, 04:00 - Zürich)Es war ein winterlicher Tag, wo zu weissem Matsch, der glatt geworden war, verwandelte Schneereste auf der Asphaltstrasse lagen. Eine Nonne ging in der Mitte der Strasse auf der Fahrbahn, statt auf dem Fusssteig, die abschüssige Strasse herab, zum Teil wohl, weil es dort bequemer war, zum Teil vielleicht auch, weil man dort wie ein Kind rutschen konnte. Sie war noch jung und hatte ein intelligentes gebildetes Gesicht. Auf dem Rückweg ging ich selbst ebenso auf der Mitte der Strasse bergauf und genoss es. Die Nonne, die glaube ich eine Schulklasse von Mädchen führte, die alle auch auf der Strasse gingen, kam mir wieder auf der Mitte der Strasse bergab gehend entgegen. Ich sagte zu ihr, dass ich jetzt auf die selbe Weise bergauf ginge wie sie bergab. Sie antwortete, dabei mich als Herr Kollege ansprechend. Ich trug einen Bademantel über dem Nachthemd, so dass es vielleicht wie eine Kutte aussah und sie mich deshalb für einen Mönch hielt. Sie sagte, dass sie solche Naturerscheinungen, wie diese eigenartige Verwandlung der Strasse durch das Wetter schon oft vor besonderen und einschneidenden Ereignissen erlebt habe. So sei es auch jetzt, denn sie musste in den nächsten Tagen auf einen anderen Kontinent, es war, glaube ich, Afrika. Sie erzählte sehr besinnlich und nachdenklich, benutzte auch irgend einen lateinischen, zur Ordenssprache gehörenden Fachausdruck, und wirkte zugleich kindlich unternehmungslustig auf der glatten verwandelten Strasse.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3447 (1994-12-02, 04:45 - Zürich)Ich schrieb einen Brief an Urs Imoberdorf. Dazu hatte ich mir aus dem Computer Briefform und Briefkopf aus einem anderen Brief herauskopiert. Es war ein feierlicher, in relativ grosser Schrift geschriebener und auf Mitte gesetzter Briefkopf. Dann hatte ich eine Zeile in einer besonderen, leicht fettgedruckten Schrift geschrieben. Das hatte irgend eine Bedeutung, die ich jetzt vergessen habe. Dann schrieb ich auf dem Schoss mit der Hand mit meinem Füllfederhalter weiter. Seraina sass dabei vor mir, so, dass ihr Kopf gerade in der Höhe des Briefblattes war. Sie legte ihr Kinn so auf meine Knie, dass es dabei gerade auf die eben geschriebene Zeile aus schwarzer Tinte kam. Ich stellte mir vor, dass diese dabei verwischt und ihr Kinn schwarz geworden sei, und dass das für Urs Imoberdorf dann graphologisch besonders interessant aussehen müsse. Ich zog ihren Kopf vorsichtig hoch und sagte etwas darüber zu Bille, die neben mir sass und etwas las. Beim Blick auf das Papier sah ich noch, dass oben unter dem Briefkopf seitlich, und ebenfalls gross und in einer gefälligen Schrift gedruckt, das Wort Registerentscheid stehen geblieben war. Es musste aus der Vorlage stammen, die offenbar ein amtlicher Brief war. Ich fand auch das sehr amusant und dachte, eine Anmerkung darüber auf den Brief an Urs Imoberdorf zu schreiben. Als ich Serainas Kinn vorsichtig wieder von der Schrift weggezogen hatte, sah ich, dass diese erstaunlicher Weise nicht verwischt war, und nahm an, dass dann wohl auch ihr Kinn nicht schwarz geworden war. Dann erwachte ich. (249 words)

Ich habe Papiere auf einem Tisch davor ausgebreitet, mit denen ich irgend etwas erledige oder auf denen ich etwas entwerfe, bin nun aber irgendwohin gegangen, merke aber, dass es zu regnen beginnt, kehre deshalb noch einmal zurück, um die Papiere in Sicherheit zu bringen, und mache mich dann wieder auf den Weg, gerate dabei aber in schweren aufgelösten Boden, in dem meine Schuhe stecken bleiben und schliesslich mit dicken Lehmklumpen bedeckt sind, die ich abzulösen suche. Auch sonst setzt sich der Lehm überall fest. Ich bin aber guter Dinge und sicher, dass ich das Problem und die Situation meistern kann. Jemand, der vorbei kommt, lächelt über meinen Zustand. Dann bin ich langsam aufgewacht. Das Ganze war wie in einem Zeltlagerleben gewesen. (183 words)

Dann fiel mir plötzlich ein, dass er es ja selbst ist, der beerdigt werden soll und dass er am Donnerstag., also vor drei Tagen gestorben ist.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3452 (1994-12-07, 05:30 - Zürich)"Sind Sie Adelheid von Bonin?" Das fragte mich eine Frau, die eine Lehrerin oder Ähnliches war. Es ging dabei wohl um die Deutung eines Traums oder einer verschlüsselten Geschichte. Man durfte nur mit Ja oder Nein antworten. So konnte meine Antwort nur Nein lauten und sie fragte weiter. Aber auch die anderen Anwesenden konnten nur Nein sagen. Hätte sie zum Beispiel gefragt: "Fällt Ihnen zu Adelheid von Bonin etwas ein?", hätte ich geantwortet: "Ja, das war meine Mutter". Später fragte sie dann so, dass ich das sagen konnte, und es kam heraus, dass meine Mutter Adelheid von Bonin dann durch Heirat Adelheid von Uslar hiess. Es ging dabei auch um die Identität von Adelheid von Bonin und Adelheid von Uslar. Dabei spielte auch das Bild eines schwebenden Felsbrockens oder Meteors eine Rolle, auf dem ein Haus stand wie auf dem entsprechenden Bild von Magritte. (144 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3453 (1994-12-08, 06:00 - Zürich)[Maree Hotel] Ein Mann mit Brille schaut mich von unten an. Ich stehe also. Er hockt oder kniet zu meinen Füssen. Sein Gesicht mit den kreisrunden Brillengläsern schaut aus dem Dunkel hervor. Ich erwache und finde mich in der Badewanne legend. Das Liegen ist also in dem kurzen Traum zum Stehen geworden. Der vor mir hockende oder kniende Mann wäre gleichsam, wenn ich in Wirklichkeit liege in der Wanne, wie über mir schwebend. (71 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3454 (1994-12-09, 04:00 - München)Ich kam in ein vornehmes pubartiges Lokal, um dort eine Rechnung zu bezahlen, die die Kinder betraf, für irgend etwas, was dort für sie gemacht worden war. Das Mädchen hinter der Theke schlug zu dem dafür berechneten Betrag von 11 Franken einfach einen weiteren Betrag von 45 Franken dazu und sagte, als ich fragte, das sei für das Spiel von Cyril und Hiemann. Hiemann war offenbar ein amerikanischer Bekannter der Kinder. Ich erkundigte mich, was damit gemeint sei, und sie sagte, die hätten lange Kricket gespielt, und sie hätte den Betrag analog berechnet zu einem Betrag, den wir früher einmal ausgehandelt hatten für irgendetwas, was die Kinder gemacht hatten und was man dann als Spiel bezeichnet hatte. Ich sagte: "Wussten denn die beiden, dass das etwas kostet?" Sie antwortete: "Nein". Ich sagte: "Das können Sie doch nicht machen!". Ich überlegte, dass es vielleicht einfacher sei, den geforderten Betrag zu zahlen, als mit diesem hochgestochenen und unberechenbaren Lokal einen Streit anzufangen, fand dann aber doch, dass es wirklich zu weit ginge, und überlegte, ihr zu sagen, dass zum Beispiel in vielen englischen Pubs Tischbillardspiele aufgestellt sind, an denen die Leute spielen, ohne, dass es etwas kostet, und dass sie ein Schild mit dem Hinweis auf die Kosten aufstellen müssten, wenn sie so etwas wollten. Ich hatte auch das Gefühl, dass sie die Sache ad hoc erfunden hatte. Auch sagte ich mir, dass es ja hier um etwas ging, woran die Kinder garnicht direkt beteiligt waren, sondern ihre Freunde. Bei diesen Überlegungen wachte ich auf. Das Spiel namens Kricket war in dem Traum etwas, das im Raum auf einem Tisch gespielt wurde. (270 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3456 (1994-12-11, 06:15 - München)Wir waren in einem Hotel oder einem Art Klubhaus oder Gästehaus eines Vereins. Die Frau hinter der Theke sagte zu Emme, als wir vorbeigingen: "Ihr Bett steht im Okai, für eine Nacht, und die Toilette ist draussen". Emme sagte: "Das gibt aber Schwierigkeiten." Sie hatte vorher ein Zimmer mit Toilette gehabt. Ich sagte: "Sie kann ja in meinem Zimmer schlafen und ich im Okai." Offenbar gab es in dem Haus nur Einzelzimmer, aber ich überlegte im Stillen, dass wir ja in der Nacht einfach das Bett aus dem Raum, der Okai genannt wurde, in mein Zimmer tragen konnten. Der andere Raum war eine Art Zwischenzimmer, das normaler Weise nicht bewohnt wurde. Emmes Umquartierung für eine Nacht war offenbar schon vorher besprochen und aus Dispositionsgründen nötig. Die junge Frau hinter der Theke war mit meinem Vorschlag zufrieden. Der Name Okai wurde wie OK gesprochen und war eine Buchstabenabkürzung. Die Ähnlichkeit mit der Bezeichnung OK für "In Ordnung" fiel mir aber im Traum nicht auf. (163 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3458 (1994-12-12, 06:15 - München)Ich war bei der Ärztin, aber nicht als Patient, sondern wir unterhielten uns über irgend etwas. Ihr Sohn war auch dabei. Es war schon spät am Abend und wir sassen im Zimmer an einer weissen Wand, die frisch gestrichen worden war. Ab und zu sah ich einen weisen Tropfen Farbe die Wand herunterlaufen und sich seinen Weg auf der rauhen, leicht unebenen Fläche suchen. Es war wohl eine Rauhputztapete oder eine sonst leicht uneben gestaltete Fläche. Die Tropfenbahn versiegte dann meist irgendwo. Dann begann aber eine Art weisser Sprühregen und, um nicht davon getroffen zu werden und meine Kleider nicht auf diese Weise mit weissen Farbtropfen fleckig zu machen, verabschiedete ich mich. Als ich aufstand, sah ich, dass die Hose offenbar schon von solchen weissen Tropfen getroffen war. Ich hatte eigentlich auch etwas zu besprechen, was mich als Patient betraf, musste einen Termin ausmachen und hatte irgendeinen Test gemacht, dessen Ergebnis zu besprechen war. Da es aber schon so spät geworden war, sagte ich, dass ich morgen ihre Sprechstundenhilfe anrufen wolle. Sie sagte: "Das wird lange dauern, aber ich habe beschlossen, meine Praxis auf alle Fälle weiter zu machen, solange es irgend geht". Ich sagte, ich fände es auch richtig, dass sie auf jeden Fall die Praxis weitermache. und sie antwortete, dass sie schon einmal versucht habe, aufzuhören, aber...- Sie liess den Satz offen und ich ergänzte: "Es war dann viel schlimmer". Dem stimmte sie zu. Vorhergegangen war eine andere Szene, wo es um den Kauf bestimmter Umschläge in der Papierabteilung eines Kaufhauses ging, die aber sehr schlecht ausgerüstet war und gerade die Umschläge diese Formates nicht hatte. Irgendwie ist es wohl von da in die Arztszene übergegangen. (278 words)

Ich ging trotzdem diesen Weg, weil ich wusste, dass es die richtige Richtung war und ich mich sonst auf dem Rückweg verirren würde. Auch wusste ich, dass überall fester Strassenboden war und die Überschwemmung wohl nicht höher als kniehoch war. Dann andere Szene. Ich war irgendwo in einer Gesellschaft und jemand schlug vor, ob wir unsere Betten nicht im Freien "Am Ende der Welt" aufschlagen wollten. Das war der Name für eine Gegend in der Nähe. Ich fand den Gedanken eines Übnernachtens im Freien nicht schlecht und erwachte bei den Überlegungen darüber. (108 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3461 (1994-12-15, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich fuhr mit Emme auf dem offenen unbedachten Führerstand einer Lokomotive, mit der wir einen Güterzug zogen. Wir sassen auf diesem Führerstand, der sich an der Spitze der Lokomotive befand, wie auf einem Kutschbock. Vor uns fielen Steine von der die Schienen überragenden Nase eines Berges direkt auf die Schienen herab. Es war ein starker Steinschlag, und es war mir klar, dass uns die Steine auf den Kopf treffen und erheblich verwunden könnten, wenn wir jetzt mit unserer Lokomotive darunter durch fahren würden. Ich sagte das zu Emme. Sie schätzte aber die Gefahr gering ein und meinte, es werde schon nichts passieren und es würden schon nicht gerade in dem Moment, wo wir darunter durchfahren, erneut Steine herunterfallen. Mir dagegen war klar, dass das sehr wohl passieren konnte und dass der Steinschlag vielleicht sogar durch die Erschütterung der Lokomotive direkt ausgelöst werden konnte. Ich sagte darum zu Emme.: "Halt doch mal an", was sie auch tat, damit wir darüber nachdenken konnten. Ich überlegte, ob wir nicht irgend ein Brett aus Eisen oder ähnliches auf der Lokomotive hätten, das wir uns über den Kopf halten könnten. Bei diesen Überlegungen wachte ich zugleich mir einem etwas schlechten Gewissen über meine grosse Vorsicht auf. (201 words)

Ich überlegte, ob ich mit der Bahn fahren sollte, oder ein anderes Verkehrsmittel nehmen, aber die Zeit würde in jedem Fall nicht reichen. Bei diesen Überlegungen wachte ich seufzend auf und Emme, die es hörte, fragte, was los sei.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3463 (1994-12-16, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich musste eine Vorlesung oder einen Vortrag über Ausdruckspsychologie halten. Der Vortrag war am Nachmittag und jetzt war es Vormittag des selben Tages. Ich wollte gerne bestimmte Bilder zeigen, ich glaube von Musikern oder Malern, die mir besonders ausdrucksstark und sehr geeignet schienen. Diese hätte ich aber erst noch photographieren und die Dias entwickeln lassen müssen. Dafür konnte ja die Zeit garnicht reichen. Ich überlegte, dass ich ja auch die alten Dias von früheren Ausdruckspsychologievorlesungen nehmen könnte. Dann kam ich aber zufällig an einem Photogeschäft vorbei und fragte den Mann hinter der Theke, wo man Bilder zum Entwickeln abgeben konnte, wie lange es dauern würde, einen Diafilm zu entwickeln. Er wiegte den Kopf und sagte dann: "Eine Stunde". So würde die Zeit also doch reichen. Ich fragte, was es kosten würde, und er sagte: "Zehn Mark fünfzig". Es müsse eben gut gemacht werden. Ich dachte darüber nach, ob es der Preis für den ganzen Film sei, oder etwa für das einzelne Dia, was ich aber für unwahrscheinlich hielt. Er fragte, ob ich den Film dabei hätte und ich sagte. "Noch nicht." Ich musste ja die Bilder erst machen und hier tauchten neue Schwierigkeiten auf. Ich hatte ja den neuen Phototisch und die Beleuchtung noch garnicht aufgebaut und hatte wohl auch nicht den richtigen Film. Es musste ja ein Kunstlichtfilm sein. Ich überlegte auch, ob ich die Bilder sattdessen aus freier Hand machen sollte, was allerdings eine sehr ruhige Hand und ein sorgfältiges Ausbalancieren des Ausschnittes und der entsprechenden Kamerahaltung erforderte. Bei diesen Überlegungen wachte ich seufzend auf, und Emme, die es hörte, fragte: "Was ist?" Ich sagte: "Immer noch die selbe Sache" Emme antwortete: Das ist schon eine Stunde her. Es ist nur ein Traum:". In diesem Moment schlug die Uhr draussen fünf. (293 words)

Wir waren in Ferien dorthin gefahren, aber wir hatten die Wohnung ganz und richtig wieder. Wir waren am Morgen auf dem Weg dorthin. Ich ging zu Fuss durchs Grüne durch eine Gegend am Waldrand, wo die Wiese zum Teil überschwemmt war, so dass ich einen grossen Bogen um die nassen Wiesenteile machen musste. Ich war rechtzeitig losgegangen, denn wir mussten zu einer bestimmten Morgenstunde in der Wohnung sein, die ich auf diesem Wege erreichen konnte. Es waren schon Sachen von uns im Keller, wo ich schon gewesen war. Ich überlegte, wie wir die Möbel über die Treppe tragen konnten. Emme und die Kinder waren noch unterwegs, wohl mit der Bahn, und sollten zur selben Zeit in der Wohnung ankommen. Ich freute mich auf die Wohnung und auch über den schönen Weg durchs Grüne und am Waldrand dorthin. Es waren gleichzeitig Ferien in Freiburg und dass uns die Wohnung wieder gehörte. (160 words)

Die neue war aber zwar sehr leicht, aber sehr viel länger als die alte und wie ein Gewehr gestaltet. Ihr Sucher war eine Scheibe, wie ein kleiner Fernsehschirm, und nicht ein Okular, das man ganz dicht ans Auge halten konnte. Es gab auch noch ein anderes Modell in dem Laden, das nach älteren und konservativeren Prinzipien gemacht war, wie die Frau in dem Laden sagte, der von einem Ehepaar betrieben wurde. Dieses Gerät war aber eher etwas schwerer und genau so lang wie das ganz neue. Ich überlegte die Vor- und Nachteile und wachte dabei auf. (108 words)

Erst war die Frage, was man mit diesen machen sollte, bis man sich durchrang, den Inhalt fort zu tun, dann die Frage, was man mit den Essensträgern und Kochgeschirren tut. Schliesslich gelang es mir, Interessenten dafür zu finden, die sie mitnahmen, und es entstand sogar eine gewisse Konkurrenz zwischen ihnen. (77 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3467 (1994-12-19, 01:00 - Zürich)Wir bewegen uns durch ein System von unterirdischen Gängen, in denen in verschiedener Höhe Wasser steht, das in einigen von ihnen bis zum Kinn reicht, wobei bei einigen gleichzeitig die Decke so niedrig ist, dass sie den Kopf berührt. Da es ganz dunkel ist, muss man sich durch gegenseitiges Rufen orientieren. Irgendwo in der Mitte ist ein etwas höher gelegener Raum, in dem das Wasser niedrig steht und man sich ausruhen kann. Zwei etwas merkwürdige, eher rüpelhafte Leute sind dort zurückgeblieben, als die anderen weiter gehen. Ich muss mich an ihnen vorbeidrängen, um durch eine Luke in den nächsten dunklen und niedrigen Gang zu kommen, und verpasse dabei etwas den Anschluss. Durch Rufen nach Emme, die mir antwortet, merke ich, wo die anderen sind und kann ihnen folgen, da der Gang nur so breit ist, dass man nicht seitlich abweichen kann, während andere Räume in dem unterirdischen System eher Hallen sind, in denen man sich verirren könnte, weil sie verschiedene Ausgänge haben. Es riecht überall kellerig, aber das Wasser ist sauber. Es ist wohl Grundwasser oder eine Trinkwasserversorgung. Mitten in diesem Labyrinth wache ich auf und fühle mich noch eine Weile durch die Enge und Dunkelheit und das hochstehende Wasser bedroht. (201 words)

Ich gehörte zu einem Transport, wie einem Internierten- oder Gefangenentransport. Wir wurden irgendwie bewacht aber gut behandelt. Man konnte sich in einem Badezimmer waschen, das aber gleichzeitig Toilette war, vor der die Leute Schlange standen. Emme wollte dort hinein, war aber nicht wie die anderen gecheckt worden und sagte dies. Ich sagte, sie solle trotzdem gehen, was auch keine Schwierigkeiten machte. Auch ein älterer englischer Offizier war bei den Gefangenen oder Internierten. Man schickte ihn nach Hause, was seine Frau, die ihn besucht hatte, noch garnicht begriffen hatte. Ich versuchte, ihr auf englisch zu sagen, dass ihr Mann heim gehen könne und schon vor der Tür stehe. Offenbar waren wir in England. Dann wachte ich auf.

Plötzlich hörte ich eine Stimme rufen :" Detlev?". Es war Giselas Stimme. Sie musste hier irgendwo hinter einer Tür sein. Ich rief zurück: "Gisela? - Wo bist Du?" Sie antwortete: "Zimmer sechs". Es war die Tür, vor der ich gerade stand. Ich öffnete sie und trat ein. Es war ein grosses Zimmer, voller Kranker, und in dem Bett am nächsten bei der Tür lag Gisela, die gerade Besuch von irgendwelchen Leuten hatte. Wir begrüssten uns begeistert. Sie sprach gerade mit ihrem Besuch über die Eigenheiten irgendwelcher Musik aus der Bidermeierzeit, die sie dabei zitierend nachmachte. Sie sah ausgeruht und nicht sehr krank aus. Offenbar war sie zu irgendeiner Behandlung hier. Sie war natürlich genau wie ich in den Jahren und Jahrzehnten, in denen wir uns nicht gesehen hatten, älter geworden, sah aber wohl und vergnügt aus. Wir waren beide von dem Wiedersehen berührt. Dann wachte ich auf, noch die Stimme im Ohr. (169 words)

Es kann auch die Abteilung in einem Kaufhaus gewesen sein. Ich selber hatte nur einen Apfel aus Metall oder anderem Material, der schnell eingepackt war, als ich schliesslich dran war, aber die Frau vor mir und die Frau hinter mir hatten beide viele Dinge. Die Frau vor mir hatte während des langen Wartens in der Schlange von jemand auch zwei schöne kleine Käthe-Kruse-Puppen geschenkt bekommen, die sie jetzt unverpackt mitnahm, da sie ja nicht dort gekauft worden waren, und die Frau hinter mir war von dem langen Warten ganz angestrengt, hatte gerötete Backen und wirkte älter, als ob sie während unseres langen Wartens in der Schlange gealtert sei. Ich strich ihr zum Abschied über die Backe, weil sie durch das Warten so erschöpft wirkte, um sie zu ermuntern. (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3472 (1994-12-23, 03:15 - Zürich)Giselas v.Uslars Vater, Onkel Werner, war gestorben. Ich kam vom C.G.Jung-Institut nach Hause und nahm sie in den Arm und wir standen eine Weile so da und sie liess die Trauer zu. Es hatte einen ganz kurzen Moment gedauert, als ich heimkam und sie da stehen sah, bis ich richtig realisierte, dass sie ja seine Tochter ist. Es kam eine grosse unmittelbare Trauer in ihr auf, obwohl er ja schon seit vielen Jahrzehnten tot war. Es fiel mir im Traum garnicht als Widerspruch auf, dass er einerseits gerade jetzt gestorben, andererseits schon seit Jahrzehnten tot war, obwohl ich beides im Traum wusste. Sie sagte, es wäre so, wie wenn C.G.Jung selbst einen umarmte, oder so müsse es sein, wenn Jung dies tue. Wir legten uns dann langsam, so umarmt, zurück und gerieten dabei an dem Rand der Wiese, auf der wir standen, in eine Art Netz oder Hängematte, die uns hielt. Es war eine wunderschöne Landschaft, die zugleich Heimat war. (160 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3473 (1994-12-24, 03:15 - Zürich)Ich soll eine Vorlesung über Metabole, Wandlung halten. Ein anderer Professor hat diese Vorlesung angekündigt, kann sie aber nicht halten, und ich soll ihn vertreten. Ich bin auf dem Weg zum Hörsaal durch die Stadt, habe aber schon drei Minuten Verspätung und werde wohl noch eine Minute brauchen, bis ich ihn erreicht habe. Ich wollte an sich noch zu Hause vorbeigehen, um Aufzeichnungen zu holen. Dazu reicht die Zeit aber garnicht. Ich kann die Vorlesung auch ganz frei halten, da mir das Thema vertraut ist und mich sehr interessiert. Ich bin schon ganz ausser Atem vom Laufen und arbeite mich mit grosser Mühe und Anstrengung vorwärts. Ich werde also sehr ausser Atem dort ankommen. Während des Laufens überlege ich mir den Anfang der Vorlesung. Ich will sagen, dass Metabole unser Thema ist und wörtlich soviel wie Umschlag heisst, und dass es Wandlung bedeutet. Dass dies ein Begriff von Heraklit ist, für den Wandlung und Bewegung und Veränderung der Grundzug des Seins ist, und dass Wandlung auch einer der Grundbegriffe C.G.Jungs ist. Auch das lateinische Mutabor, "Ich verwandle mich", fällt mir ein. Ich hoffe sehr, dass die Hörer noch geduldig im Hörsaal sitzen, und wache mit dem Gefühl des Ausser-Atem-Seins auf. (200 words)

Ich selber finde das auch und sage es. Es sieht aus wie bei Elvis Presley. Er sagt: "Ich habe gedacht,sie wollen das so. Bitte nehmen sie noch einmal Platz". Ich zeige mit den Fingern, mich im Spiegel betrachtend, wie viel sie mir zu lang scheinen, und ein anderer Friseur, der als eine Art Assistent dabei ist, sagt: "Etwa vier Zentimeter".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3477 (1994-12-27, 03:30 - Zürich)Unten im Haus, halb im Keller, waren Regale mit alten, zum Teil sehr alten, Büchern, die verschiedenen Leuten, darunter auch Hochwälders, gehörten, oder gehört hatten. Sie standen schon lange da. Ich hatte im Lauf der Zeit aus diesen Büchern und auch aus anderen Quellen Zitate rausgeschrieben, die mir gefielen, und diese nun handschriftlich zu einem Buch zusammengestellt, aus dem ich Emme, Alli und andern, die da unten in einem Zimmer versammelt waren, vorlas. Die Zusammenstellung folgte in der Reihenfolge dem Zufall, wie es sich bei der Abschrift ergeben hatte, war aber dabei in sich sinnvoll geworden. Irgendwann gingen die anderen heraus vor die Tür des Raumes, konnten mich aber dort auch noch hören. Ich hatte aber nun Schwierigkeiten beim Entziffern der Schrift, in der die Namen der Autoren, deren Aussprüche ich zitiert hatte, jeweils mit roter Tinte geschrieben waren. Nun merkte ich, dass sie beim Rausgehen das Licht ausgeknipst hatten, und rief ihnen zu, sie sollten es doch wieder anmachen. Dann war das Vorlesen zu Ende, und ich musste die Bücher möglichst in der alten Ordnung zurückstellen, die mir gefühlsmässig noch bekannt war. Sie kamen beim Zurückstellen aber doch etwas durcheinander. Ich musste die ganze Reihe hin und her schieben und dabei bildeten sich Stauungen, in denen die Bücher hervorkamen und herunterfielen. Schliesslich wuchs die Unordnung, und ich stellte einzelne der sehr alten Bücher, die noch aus früheren Jahrhunderten stammten, am Ende der Reihe auf, wo aber auch andere Dinge standen und herumlagen, in die sie nicht hineingeraten sollten. So wurde das Ordnen langsam schwieriger und ich erwachte. (258 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3478 (1994-12-28, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich wohnte mit meinem Bruder und anderen in einer Wohnung zusammen. Es war auch ein Bild von uns da, auf dem mein Bruder auf einem blauen Grund stand und vor einem tiefblauen Hintergrund. In einer anderen Szene war es ein Mädchen, das den blauen Hintergrund hatte. Ich schätzte sie sehr und streichelte ihr Gesicht. In einer anderen Szene, die auch vorher gewesen sein konnte, war es ein Bureau. Ich zeigte den Mädchen einen gefütterten Umschlag mit Sichtfenster. Um ihnen die Füllung im Inneren zu zeigen, öffnete ich den Umschlag, wo die Seiten zusammengeklebt waren. Ich zog dazu mein Hemd aus, damit es nicht mit der staubigen Füllung in Berührung kam. Es gelang mir, so in das Innere zwischen den Wänden des Umschlags einzudringen, dass meine Hand im Sichtfenster erschien. Jetzt war aber einiges von der staubigen hozwolleartigen Füllung herausgedrungen und auf den Tisch gefallen. Ich schob es mit der Hand zusammen, um es wegnehmen zu können. Da es feucht geworden war, liess es sich zusammenkehren. Dann wollte ich mein Hemd wieder anziehen, konnte es aber nicht finden. Eine aufräumende Frau im weissen Kittel hatte es gefunden und wollte es gerade wegtragen. Ich rief ihr zu und sie gab es mir wieder. Danach kam entweder das Aufwachen oder einer der Szenenwechsel.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3479 (1994-12-29, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich höre jemand sagen: "Die Identitätsgrenze ist erreicht", oder: "Die Identitätsgrenze wird überschritten". Andere Szene: Ich warte im Treppenhaus vor der Wohnung einer Psychotherapeutin. Ich bin noch etwas zu früh. Ein irgendwie ungeschickter oder unsicherer Mann kommt herein und will die Treppe hoch zu ihr gehen. Er verwechselt aber die heraufführende und die herabführende Treppe. Ich suche, ihm zu helfen, und merke dabei, dass ich selbst die beiden Treppen kaum auseinanderhalten kann. Es ist, als ob sie sich bewegen, wie bei einer unsicheren Wahrnehmung, und herauf und herab austauschbar werden. Schliesslich ist er vor ihrer Tür angekommen, und ich ziehe mich eine Etage tiefer so unter die Decke des unteren Stocks zurück, das ich durch das Treppenhaus nicht zu sehen bin, denn es ist ja noch zu früh. Ich bin etwa zehn Minuten zu früh gekommen. Dort steht ein Bett, auf das ich mich setze, um meine Hose anzuziehen, die ich ausgezogen habe und die Schuhe zu schnüren. Eine Frau, die in der unteren Etage wohnt, kommt aus der Glastür, als ich gerade damit fertig bin, aber noch auf dem Bett sitze. Sie sieht mich nicht, setzt sich aber auch auf das Bett, beugt sich vor, um herauf zu sehen, und ruft nach ihrer Oberbewohnerin, der Psychotherapeutin, mit dem Namen Setz, oder Letz, oder ähnlich. Das ist sozusagen ein abgekürzter Name, mit dem sie im Haus gerufen wird. Diese schaut aus der Tür und antwortet: "Ja" Und die Frau neben mir ruft auf schwäbisch: "Tiefflieger sind dagewesen". "Ist etwas kaputt?", ruft dei andere. Das scheint aber nicht der Fall zu sein. Sie sieht von oben herabblickend uns beide auf dem Bett sitzen, wo die Frau inzwischen mich auch entdeckt hat und mir freundlich zunickt, und die Psychotherapeutin ruft herab: "Es sieht aus wie ein richtiger Stilltisch", wobei sie das Wort Stilltisch gebraucht wie Stillleben. Es heisst also soviel wie ein Tisch mit einem Stilleben drauf, womit sie die Art meint, wie wir dort friedlich nebeneinander sitzen. Vorher hatte ich noch darüber nachgedacht, dass ich hätte das Geld für die Bezahlung der Psychotherapiestunde mitbringen sollen, dies aber vergessen hatte und auch die Höhe des Betrages nicht mehr wusste. Ich musste das der Therapeutin sagen und dachte, sie würde sicher sagen, dass dies eine Fehlleistung sei. Ich fand aber, dass es das nicht war, sondern ich das Geld ganz einfach nur vergessen hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3480 (1994-12-30, 04:10 - Zürich)"Sie stehen etwas flegelhaft da". Diese Worte sagte ein Mann an der Tür des Raums zu mir. Es regte mich sehr auf und ich war empört. Die Vorgeschichte war folgende: Ich war in einem Haus, das wohl zur Universität gehörte oder die Universität war, zugleich aber etwas wie ein Rundfunk- oder Fernsehgebäude. Ich pflegte mich immer in dem Raum aufzuhalten, an dessen Tür ich jetzt stand, die aber nur mit einem Vorhang zugehängt war. Es war normalerweise ein Aufenthaltsraum. Jetzt aber wurde von dort eine Sendung gemacht, die man im ganzen Haus auch durch Lautsprecher hörte und auf Schirmen sah. Es war irgend ein Geschehen, das durch einen irren Lärm begleitet wurde, der garnicht dazugehörte, sondern von einer Schreibmaschine oder etwas ähnlichem herrührte. Offenbar merkten das die Leute, die die Sendung machten, garnicht, und es sagte ihnen niemand, worüber ich mich wunderte. Ich schaute nun in den Raum herein, um zu überlegen, ob ich trotzdem wie üblich hineingehen könne. Bei mir hatte ich einen Wagen oder Karren, auf dem man Dinge transportieren konnte und den ich immer bei mir hatte und überall hin mitnahm, weil er sonst gestohlen wurde. Sein Griff, der mit Flügelschrauben festgehalten wurde, war gerade lose und ich zog eine der beiden Schrauben nach. Während ich noch nachdenklich in den Raum hineinschaute, an der Tür stehend, kam ein unwirscher Mann, der wohl der Leiter der Sendung war, und sagte, dass man nicht hinein könne, was ich nicht einsah, weil da sehr viel Platz war und ich wie immer dort hätte sitzen können. Merkwürdiger Weise hörte man die störende Geräuschquelle hier nicht. Während ich noch an die Tür gelehnt so nachdachte, sagte er die Worte: "Sie stehen etwas flegelhaft da:" Das fand ich denn doch zu weitgehend und wollte ihm das sagen. Er aber entfernte sich ganz schnell und ich ging hinterher. Den Wagen, den ich bei mir hatte, musste ich stehen lassen, nachdem ich ihn eine Weile mit durch diesen Raum gezogen hatte, wenn ich ihm folgen wollte, weil er so kolossal schnell war. Schliesslich musste ich sogar laufen, wenn ich ihn erreichen wollte. Inzwischen hatte der Raum als Boden eine Eisdecke wie ein zugefrorerner See, über die wir liefen. Er hatte ein Loch in das Eis geschlagen und ging nun ins Wasser, oder war das Loch schon da und bildete eine Art offene Rinne, durch die er nun schwamm. Ich holte ihn schliesslich ein und wollte ihn endlich zur Rede stellen und zu ihm sagen, dass ich schliesslich in dieser Universität Professor sei, dachte auch, dass es kein Wunder sei, dass niemand diesem Mann sagte, wenn seine Sendung ein Störgeräusch hatte. Aber er tauchte unter die Eisdecke, wo er unerreichbar war, und machte dort allerlei Kunststücke. Ein Assistent stand dabei und beobachtete ihn unter dem Eis und zeigte mir seine Kunststücke, wohl auch besorgt, er könne sich unter der Eisdecke verirren. Ich machte mir inzwischen Sorgen, ob der zurückgelassene Wagen nicht gestohlen werden könne und ging zurück und erwachte. (493 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3481 (1994-12-31, 04:10 - Zürich)Wir waren wieder in Freiburg und hatten dort in einem Eckhaus in der Talstrasse eine Dachwohnung gemietet, die sehr gemütlich war und uns an unsere alte Dachwohnung in einem Eckhaus, nur ein kleines Stück weiter, erinnerte Während die alte Wohnung an der Ecke zur Hildastrasse lag, lag diese neue auf der selben Strassenseite, nur ein kleines Stück weiter in Richtung Johanniskirche, ebenfalls an der Ecke zu einer nach Süden führenden Seitenstrasse. Die Besitzerin war Frau Morgenlicht, auf deren Namen ich mich zuerst nicht besinnen konnte, als ich zu Emme davon sprach, die Tochter, die nach dem Tod des Hauwirts schon die Besitzerin auch der ersten Wohnung an der Ecke Hildastrasse gewesen war. Ich sagte zu Emme, dass es doch erstaunlich sei, dass wir nach so langer Zeit wieder die selbe Hausbesitzerin hätten. Die Wohnung hatte ein Klo unter einer Dachschräge. Dort war der Fussboden morsch und in der Nacht plötzlich eingebrochen und auch das Klo war dabei in der Tiefe verschwunden. Für dieses Problem, das uns aber nicht sonderlich aufregte, musste nun eine Lösung gefunden werden, weshalb ich mit der Frau Morgenlicht sprechen musste. Die Freude über die neue Wohnung, die wieder eine Dach - und Altbauwohnung mit lauter schrägen Wänden war, überwog so sehr, dass mir die Bedeutung des fehlenden Klos erst nach dem Erwachen richtig klar wurde. Ich war vorher bei einer Art Tagung gewesen, wo man den ganzen Tag wie in einem Pfadfinderlager unter Biwackbedingungen etwas machen musste, und war nun unrasiert nach Hause gekommen, aber eben sehr glücklich über die neue Wohnung in Freiburg.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3484 (1995-01-02, 03:45 - Zürich)Ich bin in einem grossen älteren Haus, in dem die Zimmer wie in einem Hotel durch ein Haustelephon miteinander verbunden sind. Ich habe mein Portemonnaie, wohl irgendwo im Haus, verloren und rufe deswegen Emme in der Küche an, wo sie gerade etwas kocht. Nach einer Weile finde ich das Portemonnaie aus rotem Leder und ein anderes Schwarzes, das ich ebenfalls verloren habe, vor meiner Zimmertür, wo sie mir aus der Tasche gefallen sein müssen. Ich will Emme wieder anrufen, höre aber, wenn ich den Hörer abnehme, immer zwei Leute in einem anderen Zimmer, mit denen ich vorher schon einmal verbunden war, in gebrochenem Deutsch miteinander reden. Man kann aus ihren Reden entnehmen, dass sie wohl dabei sind, ein Kreuzworträtsel zu lösen. Offenbar haben sie den Hörer nicht richtig aufgelegt und sind deshalb noch zu hören. Schliesslich drücke ich noch einmal den Knopf, der mich mit der Küche verbindet, und höre auch ein Geräusch des Läutens im Apparat. Dann meldet sich eine Stimme in gebrochenem Deutsch. Ich sage: "Entschuldigung, bin ich mit der Küche verbunden?" Die Stimme sagt etwas Bedauerndes und dass er versuchen will, mich mit der Küche zu verbinden. Jetzt höre ich aus dem Klang der Stimme, dass es wieder einer der beiden Kreuzworträtsel lösenden Leute ist. Der Anruf hat mich also wieder mit diesen verbunden und die Weiterverbindung zu Emme, der ich sagen will, das ich das Portemonnaie wieder gefunden habe, klappt nicht, weil sie ja immer noch den Hören nicht aufgelegt haben. Ich denke, dass es vielleicht klappen wird, wenn ich sie dazu bringe, den Hörer jetzt richtig aufzulegen, will aber nicht unhöflich sein, denke, dass ich vielleicht einfach die Treppen vom Dachstock, wo unser Zimmer ist, in den Keller, wo die Küche ist, herablaufen sollte, und erwache.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3485 (1995-01-04, 00:00 - Zürich)Es war eine Art Fakultätstreffen oder eine Fakultätssitzung. In einer Pause ging ich wie immer im Bademantel hinaus in einen Park, der das Gebäude umgab. Ich überlegte kurz, ob das wohl eine angemessene Kleidung war, kam aber dann zu dem Schluss, dass ich ja so schon seit Jahren immer bei den Sitzungen so hinaus ging und alle daran gewöhnt waren und es normal fanden. So begrüssten sie mich auch erfreut und jemand sagte: Aha, ist er also wieder da. Die Kleidung erschien ihnen ganz normal, weil sie sie gewohnt waren, obwohl sie selbst alle Anzüge anhatten. Ein neues Fakultätsmitglied war dabei, das über einen Dritten einen Satz sagte, in dem das Wort Er vorkam. Ich sagte: "War das eine Frag,e oder eine Anrede?". Er sagte: "Wieso eine Anrede?" Ich sagte: "Ja in dem Sinne, wie man früher zum Beispiel gesagt hat: 'Komm er mal her'". Das fand er sehr lustig und zog das Halstuch, das ich um den Hals getan hatte, so zurecht, als ob es ein Schlips sei, oder wie ein Halstuch aus dem Rokoko, und sagte etwas entsprechendes, dass es elegant aussähe. Ich entnahm dem, dass er meine Bekleidung in dem Bademantel elegant und auch ganz normal fand. Ich fühlte mich hier in dem Bademantel zu Hause. Es war, als ob es in dem Park die adäquate Bekleidung sei. Eine andere Traumszene war vorhergegangen, die auch schon in einem von einem Park umgebenen, schlossartigen Gebäude spielt. Ich filmte hier heimlich Anarchisten oder ähnliche gesellschaftsfeindliche Leute, die einen Umzug mit Fackln machten. Zuerst waren sie empört, als sie mich entdeckten, und wollten mich verjagen. Dann aber gelang es mir, sie zu überzeugen, dass ich für sie ja harmlos sein müsse, das sie ja sowieso durch einen Fackelzug auf sich aufmerksam machten. Das sahen sie ein. (296 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3486 (1995-01-06, 00:30 - Zürich)Bei einer Orpernaufführung hat man dem Tänzer die Entscheidung darüber überlassen, wann die Oper genügend geprobt und reif zur Aufführung ist. Ich bin begeistert über dieses Vorgehen, denn der Tänzer ist eine besonders ausgereifte Persönlichkeit und von grossem künstlerischen Format, so dass er tatsächlich der Geeignetste ist, das zu entscheiden. Was mich begeistert, ist aber, dass man die Konsequenz daraus gezogen und ihm tatsächlich diese Entscheidung überlassen hat, die konventionell ja anderen zugestanden hätte, die in der Rangordnung viel höher stehen als er. Es könnte die Aufführung einer Oper von Gluck gewesen sein oder einer Barockoper. Ich rede mit jemand über dieses Vorgehen bei der Entscheidungsfällung und sage ihm, wie begeistert ich darüber bin, und merke, dass er es ebenso sieht und beurteilt, was mich auch nicht wundert, da er sehr viel von Kunst versteht und ein sehr differenziertes und sicheres Urteil hat.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3487 (1995-01-06, 07:30 - Zürich)Ich hatte mir bei einem Optiker in Tübingen oder Stuttgart, den ich schon lange kannte, eine Brille bestellt, die mir zugeschickt werden sollte, da ich schon am nächsten Morgen zurückfahren musste. Ich war wohl zu einem Vortrag oder ähnlichem in der Stadt gewesen. Die Brille war aber nicht angekommen. Dagegen war eine Reisetasche, die ich dort hatte stehen lassen, angekommen und in der Tasche eine Cordhose, die er für mich weiter gemacht hatte. Ich suchte nun noch einmal alles durch, ehe ich beginnen wollte, einen Brief zu schreiben, dass die Brille nicht in der Sendung gewesen sei. Plötzlich spürte ich etwas Hartes in der Hand, als ich die Hose für alle Fälle noch einmal abtastete. Die Brille in ihrem Etui steckte in der Hosentasche, wo er sie offenbar hineingesteckt hatte, weil er das eine günstige Verpackung fand. Es war eine Brille, deren Gläser und Fassungen halbkreisförmig waren, so dass man gut beim Lesen über sie hinwegkucken konnte. Es war eines der beiden solchen Gestelle, die ich seit langem habe und die in England hergestellt waren, die es aber heute nicht mehr gibt. Nur die Gläser waren neu, und mir neu angepasst, weil die Weitsichtigkeit inzwischen fortgeschritten war. (197 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3489 (1995-01-07, 07:00 - Zürich)Der Vater des Unterbewohners war gestorben. Die Beerdigung hatte schon stattgefunden und wir trafen auf der Strasse seine Frau und seinen Sohn mit seinen Kindern, die hier im Traum schon älter waren als in Wirklichkeit. Da ich die Frau noch nicht ansprechen wollte, da sie noch sehr traurig war, sagte ich zum Sohn: "Wie gehts Ihnen denn jetzt?". Zu meinem Erstaunen antwortete er sehr bewegt: "Immer so allein". In diesem Moment wurde mir klar, dass er ja in der Autowerkstatt und im Geschäft immer mit dem Vater zusammen gearbeitet hatte und jetzt den ganzen Tag allein dort war. Ich legte den Arm um seine Schulter und begleitete ihn so ein Stück. Nach einer Weile sagte ich"Auf Wiedersehn" und er antwortete ebenso und auch seine Söhne, die sehr freundlich waren. Sie waren Kinder etwa schon im frühen Jugendalter und hatten modische Frisuren und dunkle Haare, was mich wunderte. Ihr Vater, der Sohn des Gestorbenen, hielt mich aber fest, so dass ich noch weiter, den Arm um seine Schulter gelegt, neben ihm her ging. Dann wachte ich auf. (176 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3490 (1995-01-08, 05:00 - Zürich)Aus irgend einem Grund sollte ich in der Nacht in einer oberen Etage des Hauses in einem Zimmer von jungen Leuten schlafen, die ich von früher her gut kannte und die auch in dem Zimmer ihre Betten hatten. Als ich schon im Bett lag, hatte mich einer der beiden der Lüge bezichtigt, worüber ich sehr empört war. Ich beschloss deshalb, nach unten in dem Haus herabzugehen, wo eigentlich mein eigenes Bett war und wo auch Emmes Bett war. Ausserdem hatte der Mann direkt hinter dem Kopfende des Bettes, in dem ich lag, eine Heizung angedreht, und es war viel zu heiss, um in der Nacht dabei zu schlafen. Ich nahm also meine Bettdecke und die Tasche, in der Lesebrille und Kugelschreiber sind, und machte mich so barfuss auf den Weg. Draussen auf dem Flur, wo es dunkel war und ich nicht auffallen wollte, nahm ich den Weg nicht zum grossen Treppenhaus, wofür ich nach links hätte gehen müssen, sondern nach rechts, weil ich wusste, dass dort noch ein zweites, wenig benütztes Treppenhaus war, durch das ich auch in die tiefere Etage und zu meinem Bett und zu Emme gelangen konnte. Dabei wachte ich auf. Die Lüge, deren mich der Mann bezichtigt hatte, bezog sich auf Dinge aus meiner Kindheit.Ich hatte etwas durch eine Tapetentür mit Emme gesprochen, die, als ich ins Bett ging, noch im Nebenzimmer war. Es hatte sich auf eine Äusserung des jungen Mannes bezogen, die er falsch wiedergegeben fand, woran er die Behauptung dass ich schon früher über die Kindheit lauter Lügen gesagt hatte, anschloss. Dabei ging es auch um etwas, was ich über die Türkei, die mit der Kindheit offenbar zusammenhing, in der Zeitung geschrieben hatte. (280 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3491 (1995-01-09, 04:20 - Zürich)Ich war mit einer Reihe von katholischen Theologen unterwegs in einer Stadt, unter ihnen der Pater Köning. Wir gingen durch Gänge, Treppen, Wege. An einer Stelle war der Pater Köning etwas zurückgeblieben. Ich wartete an der Türe eines Aufzuges, damit diese sich nicht schliesse, bis er kam. Irgendwo war auch der älteste der Patres in dem Aufzug niedergekniet. Auch ich nahm eine irgendwie ähnliche Haltung ein. Nachdem der Pater Köning mich eingeholt hatte, gingen wir eine Treppe hinab, die in einem Park im Freien mündete, von wo verschiedene Wege weiter führten. Die anderen waren schon so weit vorausgegangen, dass wir sie nicht mehr sahen. Wir versuchten zwei verschiedene Wege, indem er den einen, ich den anderen wählte. Dann kamen die anderen unter Führung des älteren Geistlichen aus einer Wiese im Park hervor, wo sie sich ausgeruht hatten. Ich sagte: "Wir haben ein wenig den Anschluss verpasst. Der Pater Köning ist in diese Richtung gegangen, ich werde ihn suchen" -und lief hinter ihm her. Er schaute sich um, irgendwo in der Menge der in dem Park spazieren Gehenden, sah mich und kam zurück. Er hatte ein graues Mönchsgewand an, das sehr elegant wirkte, während die anderen schwarz gekleidet waren in Kutten. An dieser Stelle bin ich aufgewacht. (206 words)

Drinnen liegen die Menschen, die zu der Veranstaltung gekommen sind, noch schlafend in ihren Betten, wie im Inneren eines grossen Schiffs, denn sie werden erst später geweckt. Ich muss nur den Vortrag jetzt schon vorbereiten. Dann Szenenwechsel. Jetzt hat der Vortrag schon stattgefunden und alle Leute sind schon gegangenen. Nur Verena Kast, ein Bekannter von ihr und ich sind noch da. Die beiden sind auch schon im Gehen und beginnen die Treppe wieder herunter zu steigen. Ich suche noch meine Sachen in dem inzwischen wieder dunklen Raum zusammen. Muss mich dabei auf mein Tastgefühl verlassen, weiss aber, dass ich nichts Wichtiges von meinen Vorlesungssachen vergessen darf und mich ganz darauf konzentrieren muss. Als ich das tue, beginnen die Dinge langsam trotz der Dunkelheit sichtbar zu werden.

Als die Kontrolleurin kam, sagte er, dass er keine neue Marke für seine Sichtkarte gekauft habe. Sie sagte spontan: "Sie Idiot, warum haben Sie denn das gemacht". Er aber zog in Ruhe seine durchaus mit einer gültigen Marke versehene Karte heraus und lachte. Nun nahm ich auch meine Karte vor, um sie zu zeigen. Sie hatte zwei Teile, die man ausfalten konnte, und jeder enthielt eine Monatsmarke. Es kam mir etwas daran komisch vor und ich sagte: "Stimmt da etwa auch etwas nicht". Denn es schien mir, als ob es die Marken für November und Dezember waren und gar keine Marke für den Januar da war. Und es war ja heute schon der zwölfte Januar. Aber die Monatsbezeichnungen waren sehr schwer zu lesen. Sollte ich seit dem Jahreswechsel schon immer schwarz gefahren sein, ohne es zu wissen? Die Kontrolleurin betrachtete angespannt die Marken und hatte offenbar auch Schwierigkeiten, den Monatsaufdruck zu erkennen. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass sie geneigt war, nichts zu sagen, weil sie mit der Identifikation der Marken nicht klar kam, und erwachte. (188 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3498 (1995-01-13, 03:30 - Zürich)Ich musste zum Militär und musste zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt dort sein. Ich war sehr besorgt, alles richtig zu machen und mit der ungewohnten Umgebung und Situation richtig fertig zu werden. Der Mann, der mich empfing, sprach mich aber sofort auf eine Publikation an, die ich machen sollte und die er angeregt hatte. Mit dieser Konstellation hatte ich garnicht gerechnet. Ich hatte diesen Auftrag ganz vergessen und vor allem, ich hatte den Namen des Mannes vergessen, über den ich schreiben sollte. Es schien etwas halb biographisches und halb ausdruckspsycholgisches zu sein. Eine dunkle Vorstellung von der Person, über die ich schreiben sollte, war noch da, aber der Name war mir völlig entfallen, und ich musste ihn doch kennen, um etwas über ihn und sein Werk erfahren zu können., überhaupt, um zu wissen, über wen ich schreiben sollte. Aber ich konnte den Mann, der es angeregt hatte und der nun als militärische Autoritätsperson vor mir stand, doch unmöglich danach fragen, weil er noch ganz von der mit mir besprochenen Aufgabe erfüllt war und alles natürlich als selbstverständlich voraussetzte. Ich dachte, durch abwartendes Verhalten und Reagieren Zeit gewinnen zu können, und wollte sagen, dass ich mich zunächst auf den Vortrag am 26. Januar in Berlin konzentrieren müsse. Aber irgendwann musste ich doch anfangen, zu schreiben, und wenn bis dahin der Name nicht herausgekommen sein würde, würde es kritisch werden. Bei diesen Überlegungen wachte ich auf. (233 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3499 (1995-01-13, 07:30 - Zürich)Ich war beim Räumen in der Wohnung und überall lagen Dinge umher, die durch das Räumen aufgewühlt waren. Es war noch am Morgen, und die Betten waren noch nicht gemacht, und ich hatte noch ein Nachthemd an, über das ich irgendetwas gezogen hatte. Als ich aus dem Fenster sah, sah ich den Schornsteinfeger, der mit Besen und Kugel am Haus vorbeiging, in dessen Keller er offenbar schon tätig gewesen war. Ich fragte, ob ich ihm irgendetwas aufschliessen müsse, aber das hatten andere schon für ihn getan. Dann war er auch in der Wohnung, wo er etwas machen musste, und lief auch noch mit seinen schwarzen Sachen zwischen den vielen Dingen umher. Ich hatte Zettel, wo drauf stand, was ich alles erledigen musste, denn ich hatte an dem Tag auch noch verschiedene Termine, und die Zeit lief dahin. Dann hängte sich auch noch die Tür des Wohnzimmers aus, als ich sie bewegte. Ich zwang mich zur Ruhe und liess mich nicht durch die Gegenwart des Schornsteinfegers in der Wohnung stören, als ich sie wieder einhängte. Wie es aber dabei so ist, war es sehr schwierig, sie sowohl oben wie unten gleichzeitig einzuhängen, und, wenn ich sie oben drin hatte, rutschte sie unten wieder raus, und umgekehrt. Es war ein mühsames Zielen mit der schweren Masse der Tür in der Hand. Schliesslich war es aber gelungen und ich erwachte. (227 words)

Auch viele ehemalige Studentinnen von mir waren dabei, die mich erfreut begrüssten. Einer hielt ich längere Zeit die Hand und sie mir, während ich mit unseren Töchtern redete. Es hiess, es sei ein Club für reiche Leute. Das Ganze hatte eine festliche und sehr beschwingte Atmosphäre. Wir redeten im Treppenhaus stehend miteinander. Ich war von unten heraufgekommen, sie alle kamen aus der Eingangstür einer Etage, die irgendwo unterhalb unserer Wohnung lag.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3502 (1995-01-15, 06:45 - Zürich)Ich war bei einem Mann zu Besuch, der farbenblind war, was aus seinen Reden und aus Anspielungen, die er dabei machte, hervorging. Er hatte Ahnenbilder an der Wand hängen, und ich fing an aufzuwachen, als ich gerade zu ihm sagen wollte, dass er vielleicht von einem von diesen Ahnen die Farbenblindheit geerbt habe, und dass ich auch farbenblind sei und wir vielleicht einen gemeinsamen Ahnen hätten. Hier ging der Traum in eine noch sehr traumnahe Aufwachphantasie über und ich kam darauf, dass der gemeinsame Vorfahr vielleicht Justus Ludewig von Uslar war, was offenbar stimmte, denn er war überrascht, als ich sagen konnte dass dieser sein Ahne königlich hannoverscher Generalkonsul in Mexico City und Direktor eines englischen Silberbergwerks in Mexico war. Das Gespräch ging dann in dieser Aufwachphantasie so weiter, dass ich mir vorstellte, dass auch Julius von Voigts-Rhetz, dessen Tochter Dorette ja mit meinem Grossvater ihren Vetter geheiratet hat, einer seiner Vorfahren sei, und schliesslich dass er ein Nachkomme meiner Grosstante Elli von Esmarch gewesen sei, die eine Schwester meiner Grossmutter und ebenfalls eine Tochter von Julius von Voigts-Rhetz gewesen war, und dass ich ihm nun erzählen konnte, dass sein Urgrossvater, denn er gehörte der nächsten Generation an, eine Zeit lang der Entdecker des kleinsten Tieres der Welt gewesen war, nämlich des Spyrillum parvum Esmarch, bis ein anderer ein halbes Jahr später ein noch kleineres Tier entdeckt hatte. Diese Geschichte hatte mir Tante Elli Esmarch in Göttingen erzählt, als ich im Jahr 1946 bei ihr wohnte . Hier erst wurde ich so wach, dass mir klar wurde, dass der Anfang dieses Phnatsiegesprächs ein Traum, eben der von dem farbenblinden Mann mit den Ahnenbildern an der Wand, gewesen war. (278 words)

Jemand, wohl ein Verwandter, verlangte eine Buch von Biermann und sie machte sich in dem Zimmer auf den Weg, um es zu holen. Da sie auf Grund ihres hohen Alters schon Mühe hatte, sich zu bewegen, zog sie sich seitlich an dem Möbeln vor. Ich fragte, ob ich ihr helfen könne, und sie bejahte dies. Ich life also los, und da ich mit den Sandalen, die ich anhatte, nicht so schnell vorwärts kam, schlüpfte ich aus diesen heraus und lief barfuss über den Teppich auf der Suche nach Büchern, die ich schliesslich am Rande des Teppichs auf dem Fussboden stehend fand, wo sie mit einem Tuch zugedeckt waren. Ich hob dieses ab und fuhr mit den Fingern über die Bücher, nach einem suchend, das mit B anfing, sah aber, das auf alle oben der Buchstabe B aufgemalt war, wohl ein Verlagszeichen. Sie sagte: "Haben Sie das Büchle schon gefunden?" Ich sagte: "Noch nicht." Sie hatte sich inzwischen auch genähert und zog das Buch mit einem Griff heraus und sagte dabei: "Sie sehen es doch, das Männle", und hob das Buch hoch. Es war in Gestalt eines Biermannes gemacht, der wohl, glaube ich, auch einen Bierkrug in der Hand hielt. Sei zeigte ihn mir schalkhaft und kitzelte mich dann, als sie entdeckte, dass ich barfuss war, an den Fusssohlen. Ich entspannte mich und machte autogenes Training, um so das Gekitzeltwerden an den Fusssohlen in Ruhe auszuhalten, und erwachte aus der sehr entspannten Atmosphäre dieses Traums. (249 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3515 (1995-01-28, 03:00 - Berlin)Ein Mann mit einem Elefanten, mit dem er sehr sanft und ausgewogen umging. Sie hatten ganz harmonische aufeinander abgestimmte Bewegungen. Der Mann hatte eine elektrisch angetriebene Schreibe, die wie eine Nagelfeile wirkte, mit der er dem Elefanten die Füsse behandelte. Dazu kniete er auf dem einen Bein nieder und stellte das andere Knie aufrecht im rechten Winkel. Darauf setzte der Elefant ganz sanft seinen Fuss, ohne ihn mit seinem Gewicht zu belasten und zu drücken, und nun konnte der Mann so den Fuss des Elefanten behandeln. Dann wollte ich den Traum aufschreiben. Ich war entweder wirklich aufgewacht und sofort wieder eingeschlafen, oder hatte das Aufwachen nur geträumt. Nun wusste ich aber nicht, ob ein Elefant Fussnägel habe, oder ob ich Hufe schreiben müsse. Ich fragte darum eine Frau in einem Warenhaus am Fusse des Zürichberges, in dem ich gerade war, ob sie es wisse. Sie wusste es auch nicht, sagte aber, in dem Warenhaus sei ein Mann aus Polen, der den selben Namen hätte wie der Papst und es wissen mässe, weil in seiner Heimat in Polen in der Nähe seiner Wohnung ein Zoo gewesen sie. Ich bezweifelte, ob er es deswegen wissen müsse, weil wir hier in dem Warenhaus ja auch ganz in der Nähe eines Zoos seien, der auf dem Zürichberg ist, und es trotzdem nicht wüssten. Dieser Vergleich wollte ihr aber nicht einleuchten. Der Traum setzte sich dann in anderen Szenen fort, wo ich immer noch auf der Suche nach etwas, vielleicht immer noch auf der Suche nach der Antwort auf diese Fragen, in einem Geschäft war, wo in Schränken mit Schiebebtüren Teller und Gefässe jeweils der gleichen Art in verschiedenen Grössen ineinandergesetzt waren. Darin musste man die Lösung der Frage finden, um die es ging. Immer wenn ich eine Schiebetür öffnete, war aber der Schrank, in dem die Gefässe vorher gewesen waren, leer. Es war, als ob die Schränke analog zu doppelten Böden gleichsam doppelte Türen hätten, so dass sich die Gefässe verbergen konnten, weil man nur die erste Tür geöffnet hatte. Dann hatte ich in einer anderen Szene, immer noch auf der Suche nach der Lösung eines Problems, zwei Gefährten, die mich zu einem alten Mann in einer Wohnung führen wollten, die etwas vertieft in einem Hang lag. Nun war es aber dort meterhoch verschneit und während die beiden anderen mühelos hereingekommen waren, fand ich hinter den Schneewällen den Eingang nicht. Schliesslich hatte ich eine Spalte im Schnee gefunden, durch die man herunterspringen konnte und so vor die Eingangstür geriet. Dies gelang mir auch und ich hörte drinnen die Stimmen der anderen, die schon mit dem Mann sprachen. Aber nun hatte ich meine lederne Kollegmappe nicht mehr dabei, die ich vorher noch bei mir gehabt hatte. Sie musste wohl oben auf dem Schnee liegen geblieben sein, oder schon in dem Geschäft mit den Gefässen hinter den Türen. Ich musste den Weg zurück nehmen, um sie zu holen, denn die Mappe war mir sehr lieb und wichtig und mit Erinnerungen verbunden und sie würde sicher gestohlen werden, wenn ich sie nicht gleich holte. Ich würde dann aber noch später zu dem Mann kommen, zu dem mich die beiden anderen hatten führen wollen und bei dem sie ja schon waren. Bei der Frage, wie ich dieses Dilemma lösen könne, wachte ich auf. (545 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3516 (1995-01-29, 03:10 - Berlin)Man hat Versuche gemacht mit Menschen und biologischen Bedingungen, Pflanzenwuchs und Ähnlichem und geographischen Bedingungen und den Schwerkraftbedingungen des Weltraums. In dem Zusammenhang hat man dem Meer mit bestimmten Bedingungen Boden abgewonnen, auf dem Menschen versuchsweise leben sollen.Jetzt ist das Land fertig, aber ehe die Menschen kommen, lässt man auch eine Horde Tiere darauf los, weil das Zusammenleben mit Tieren auch zu den Bedingungen des Versuchs gehören soll. Sie kommen von ferne wie eine Heerschar oder ein Schwarm heran. Es sind vor allem Affen, die mit ungeheurer Geschwindigkeit von dem Land Besitz ergreifen und darüber her rasen und über die künstlich angelegten Wälle springen, die das Land durchziehen. Durch Zufall ist eine Nichte von Emme, ein sehr schönes blondes Mädchen, bei uns zu Besuch, die auch mit Renate Staeven-Haas verwandt ist. Sie hat an einem ganz ähnlichen Versuch mitgearbeitet und dort die Erfahrung gemacht, dass auch noch bestimmte bakterielle oder ähnliche Bedingungen erfüllt sein müssen, damit dieses Zusammenleben von Mensch und Tier gelingen kann, bei dem auch eine veränderte Schwerkraft eine Rolle spielt. Wenn diese Bedingungen nicht erfüllt sind, wird, wie sie weiss und vorher uns zufällig gerade erzählt hat, ein solches Experiment scheitern. Ich komme mit den Leuten, die das Experiment leiten, ins Gespräch. Ich höre, dass sie noch eine intelligente Frau brauchen, die an dem Experiment teilnimmt. Ich empfehle ihnen dieses Mädchen, und sie sind erstaunt, dass sie so wunderschön ist, und fragen sich, ob sie auch ebenso intelligent sein kann. Ich erzähle ihnen von ihrer Erfahrung gerade auf diesem Gebiete, die sich so gut in die Situation des Versuches fügt. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. (267 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3517 (1995-01-29, 06:50 - Berlin)Ich war in einem fremden Zimmer untergekrochen, weil es in demjenigen, das ich bewohnte durchregnete, oder es sonst irgendwie unbewohnbar geworden war. In dem neuen schien es zunächst ganz gut zu gehen, dann aber entdeckte ich, dass an der einen Wand sich Würmer verschiedener Art in grossen Mengen fächerförmig ausbreiteten. Ich wusste nicht, was ich tun sollte und wie ich mit den Würmern fertig werden sollte, dachte, dass ich irgendjemand um Rat fragen müsse, hatte aber auch ein schlechtes Gewissen, weil ich vorher in dem fremden Zimmer mit einer Dusche gespielt hatte und die Wand dabei teilweise nass geworden war, weil ich irgendwelche Hebel falsch gestellt hatte. Aber daher konnten die Würmer ja unmöglich kommen. Sie mussten versteckt irgendwo gewesen sein. (121 words)

Ein Mädchen war dabei, das mir schon vorher durch die Art, wie es Polka tanzte, aufgefallen war, wo die Bewegungen besonders lebhaft und frei und vital waren. Wir tanzten hier nebeneinander und in einem gleichen Rhythmus. Ich erwachte mit einem angenehmen Gefühl aus dem Traum. (76 words)

Gespräch über die Probleme, die dabei entstehen. Dann eine Art Tagebücher von Belli, die aber eigentlich Bilderbücher sind, denn alles darin ist gemalt, nicht geschrieben. Diese Bücher hat Belli in Kästen untergebracht und das Ganze in einem würfelförmigen Gefäss. Es passt alles sehr schön organisch zusammen. Gespräch mit einem Lehrer von Belli, der die Frage aufwirft, wie man dazu kommt, solche gemalten Bücher gleichsam wie Tagebücher zu machen und zu sammeln und so zu ordnen, ob dem Ganzen gleichsam ein Entschluss zu Grunde liegt., wie zum Beispiel bei dem Schulaufsatz "Soll ich Tagebuch schreiben?" Ich sage, dass so etwas meist gewachsen entsteht und nicht aus einer Absicht. Dann andere Szene, in der Belli gesammelte Gegenstände von mir, ähnlich meinen Flohmarktsachen, in dafür geeigneten Gefässen unterbringt. Sie weiss sogar, wie man die Gegenstände auseinandernehmen kann und wo sie zusammengefügt sind. (160 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3521 (1995-01-03, 06:30 - Zürich)Es war ein merkwürdiges Naturereignis. Schwarze Brocken flogen durch die Luft. Sie mögen von einem Vulkanausbruch gestammt haben und flogen jetzt in flachen Bahnen über die Erdoberfläche. Ich hatte am Computer gesessen und etwas geschrieben, als plötzlich das Computerbild erlosch. Ich wunderte mich und merkte erst nach einem Augenblick, dass der Strom abgeschaltet worden war, wohl aus Sicherheitsgründen. Aus dem Fenster schauend sah ich dann die schwarzen Brocken ihre Bahnen ziehen. Das Haus, in dem ich mich befand, war ein grosses festes Haus in der Mitte von Zürich, etwa in der Gegend der Regierungsgebäude an der Limmat. Einer der Brocken, der zugleich aussah wie eine Art Fahrzeug, schoss auf das Haus zu und ich rechnete schon mit einem Einschlag. Er verfehlte das Haus aber, und man hörte auch nicht das Geräusch eines Einschlages. Ich erwachte mit starken Kopfschmerzen, die sich wohl auch in den auf den Kopf zu sausenden Brocken gespiegelt haben. (152 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3522 (1995-02-04, 01:45 - Zürich)Ich war in einer Firma, in der es zwei verschiedene Arten von Mitarbeitern gab. Die einen waren die Denker, die die Konzepte ausdachten, die anderen mehr die Handelnden, die sie in gleichmässiger Arbeit in die Tat umsetzten. Es können auch Ärzte gewesen sein. Einer von ihnen war ein Verwandter von Emmi, der Schultz hiess wie sie. Er hatte eine sehr junge Frau dabei, die gerade ein Baby bekommen hatte. Sie war sehr sympathisch und er sagte, es wäre, als wenn sie in der letzten Zeit noch sehr gereift wäre. Es gab ebenso, wie es eine ganze Reihe der Denker gab und eine ganze Reihe der Handelnden, die sich jeweils unter sich sehr ähnlich waren, auch eine ganze Reihe der Frauen, von denen wohl auch mehrere die Frauen oder potentiellen Frauen eines und des selben Mannes waren. Hier war aber die Entscheidung für diese Frau gefallen, was auch damit zusammenhing, dass sie es war, die das Kind bekommen hatte. Es war dann von der Taktik und Strategie der Firma die Rede, die wohl eine Ärztefirma war. Man sagte, man habe verschiedene Methoden ausprobiert und schliesslich nur die beibehalten, die zum Erfolg geführt hatten, so dass jetzt eine gleichmässige und zuverlässige Arbeitsweise und wohl auch Therapie entstanden war, die alle gleichmässig ausführten. Auf diese Weise war auch eine sehr geborgene und gleichmässige Umgebung entstanden, in der man sich irgendwie sicher fühlte. (229 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3523 (1995-02-04, 05:50 - Zürich)Ich hatte ein Polaroidphoto gemacht. Der Zusammenhang der Papierschichten hatte sich etwas gelöst und unter dem Bild kamen andere Bilder zum Vorschein. Auf einem sah man ein Stück eines Bildes von Delveaux, wo Figuren in die Höhe klettern, auf einem anderen die Sonnenblumen von van Gogh und darunter ein Stilleben von van Gogh mit Apfelsinen, die besonders schön gelb leuchteten. Ich war über diese Entdeckung sehr entzückt. Ich erinnerte mich bei einem der Bilder, dass ich ein solches Bild einmal zu photographieren versucht hatte, bei anderen nicht. Es war eine geheimnisvolle Sache, wie diese Bilder unter das aktuell gemachte geraten sein konnten. (102 words)

Man konnte die schräg nach oben verlaufenden Treppen sehen und viele Möbel, die in der ralativ engen Wohnung aufgestellt waren. Es war eine Einrichtung, die es auch ermöglichte, die Wohnung auf diese Weise zu lüften, und die Bewohner waren daran gewöhnt. Ich erklärte es jemanden, mit dem ich draussen vorbei ging. (89 words)

Der Mann zeigte mir etwas mit seiner eigenen Säge, von der Emme meinte, es sei eine Motorsäge, aber es war nur eine gewöhnliche Säge. Emme hatte nur ein entsprechendes Geräusch gehört, das aber eine andere Quelle hatte. Wir redeten mit dem Mann und sagten, dass der Baum doch eigentlich noch gesund aussehe. Er sagte, das finde er eigentlich auch, aber der Vertreter der Behörde, die das Absägen angeordnet hätte, hätte gemeint, dann müsse er die persönliche Haftung für jeden Schaden übernehmen, den die Fichte anrichten konnte, und das sei ihm dann doch zu weit gegangen. Ich betrachtete die mir bevorstehende Arbeit mit einiger Skepsis, weil ich nicht wusste, wie gut ich mit der Säge bei dem dicken Stamm zurechtkommen würde. Die Stadt erinnerte irgendwie an Berlin.

Vorher Revolution in einer Moschee, die wir angezettelt hatten. Wir hatten eine lange Stange langsam in das Innere geschoben, bis sie drinnen eine Art Altar berührte. Dann flohen wir. Ich rannte diagonal durch den Schnee über eine Wiese, wobei ich auf einen Pfad geriet, der dann begann, anzusteigen, und zu dem Nationaldenkmal führte, so dass ich mich unauffällig in die Schar der Leute einreihen konnte, die dorthin ihren Sonntagsausflug machten. Ganz im Anfang war es um eine Art von Kursen gegangen, die in einem Raum stattfanden, der dann wohl zu der Moschee wurde. Noch davor war es die Frage gewesen, wieviel solcher Kurse Tobi, der im Traum schon etwas grösser war, besuchen sollte. Tina und Felix hatten ein Programm für ihn zusammengestellt, das aber, wie sie dann merkten, zu umfangreich geworden war. (142 words)

Das haben wir verdrängt, nicht darüber gesprochen, es als selbstverständlich angesehen. Jetzt fragt mich einer der anderen. Ich sage: "Keine Ahnung. Frag den sowieso", dabei den Namen dessen nennend, der die Idee gehabt und das Ganze organisiert hat. Ich habe jetzt zum ersten mal dadurch diese Wahrheit, dass wir nicht wissen, wie wir zurückkommen, offen ausgesprochen. Erst durch das Erwachen wird mir klar, dass es ja das Problem garnicht mehr gibt, weil es die DDR garnicht mehr gibt. (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3532 (1995-02-13, 07:30 - Zürich)Ich hatte ein zusätzliches Arbeitszimmer in einem alten Haus. Ich ging mit einem Mädchen zu dem Haus, um ihm in dem Zimmer irgendetwas zu zeigen. Es war mir beim Betreten der Eingangsrampe des Hauses klar, dass ich das Mädchen in dem Haus nicht küssen dürfe, weil das unpassend war, da das Haus irgendwie zu Emmes Familie gehörte. Es fiel mir auch ein, dass Markus, der auch einen Anspruch auf das Haus hatte, einmal mit einem Mädchen dorthin gegangen war und es geküsst hatte, was man ihm übel genommen hatte. Man hatte ihn mit dem Mädchen die Eingangsrampe des Hauses betreten gesehn. Dann wechselte die Szene: Jetzt war es der Heizungsfachmann B., mit dem ich das Haus betrat und der mir in dem Zimmer etwas den Computer betreffendes erklären wollte, wofür er offenbar auch Spezialist war. Es ging um dem Anschluss eines neuen Geräts an den Computer, das wohl dem Kopieren oder Reproduzieren diente, und um die Frage, ob dafür noch ein Anschluss frei sei. Als er hörte, dass dort an einer Leitung mit zwei Anschlüssen A und B an A der Computer angeschlossen sei, fragte er, was denn an B abgeschlossen sei. Ich sagte, wir könnten das an Ort und Stelle betrachten. Es war aber die Schwierigkeit, dass man, um dort hin zu gelangen, sich durch einen Engpass aus Kartons und Kisten quetschen musste, zwischen denen nur eine leibenge Gasse frei war. Gleichzeitig war das nun auch der Eingang zu einer Bibliothek oder einem öffentlichen Raum oder Geschäftshaus, wie etwa der Firma Eschenmoser, wo ich meine Tonanlage kaufte, und auch hier war dieser Eingang mit vielen Dingen zugestellt und liess nur die leibenge Gasse über. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. (279 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3534 (1995-02-15, 05:45 - Zürich)Ich war mit Belli in der Uni verabredet. Wir hatten uns zur vollen Stunde im Hörsaal 117 verabredet, wo sie eine Vorlesung hörte, die um diese Zeit endete. Ich war nicht mehr ganz sicher, ob es der Hörsaal 117 oder 217 war, in welchem ich meine eigenen Vorlesungen habe, entsann mich aber dann, dass es der Hörsaal 117 war, und blieb aber im Treppenhaus zwischen beiden und wartete auf das Ertönen der Glocke. Dort spielte eine Frau Ziehharmonika. Ich betrachtete eine Jugendstilbemalung auf der Balustrade, die ich vorher nie bemerkt hatte und die mit noch sehr frisch wirkenden Goldtupfen vermischt war. Die Zeit verging und ich wunderte mich, dass die Glocke immer noch nicht geschlagen hatte. Plötzlich bemerkte ich, dass die Uhr schon zehn Minuten nach voll zeigte und die Pause längst begonnen hatte. Offenbar hatte ich die Glocke wegen der Ziehharmonika nicht gehört. Ich eilte zum Hörsaaleingang, wo schon die Hörer der Vorlesung in der Pause vor der Tür standen. In meinem Kopf bildete sich der Satz, den ich zu Belli sagen wollte: "Ich habe die Glocke nicht gehört wegen der blöden Ziehharmonika". Vor der Tür des Hörsaals stand ein Mann, der mich sofort in Empfang nahm, um mich zu Belli zu führen. Er sagte: "Ich bin bereit einen Teil meiner Venia zu opfern, damit sie in Ruhe mit ihr sprechen können". Offenbar war er der Professor, der die juristische Vorlesung hielt, und wollte damit sagen, dass er bereit war, etwas später anzufangen und die Pause zu verlängern, damit ich in Ruhe mit Belli sprechen könne. Ich wusste nicht recht, wie ich auf dieses grosszügige Angebot reagieren sollte, sagte aber noch entschuldigend, dass ich die Glocke oder Sirene wegen der Ziehharmonika nicht gehört habe, denn ich wusste in dem Moment nicht mehr genau, ob es ein Glockenton war oder ein Pfeif- oder Sirenenton, der die Pause ankündigte. Inzwischen hatten wir den Hörsaal, der auch voller Menschen war, die in der Pause dort standen, durchkreuzt und kamen auf eine Terrasse vor der Fenstertür, die ebenfalls voller Hörer war. Wir blickten umher, konnten aber auf der weiten Terrasse Belli nicht entdecken. Anscheinend war sie hinausgegangen, um mich im Treppenhaus zu suchen. Hier erwachte ich. (363 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3538 (1995-02-19, 04:00 - Zürich)Ich war mitten in der Landschaft und es hatte stark geregnet. Mein Heimweg führte durch ein lehmartiges Gelände, das auch unter normalen Verhältnissen schon stark aufgeweicht war, jetzt nach dem Regen aber schlammartig weich und nass war. Ich wusste, dass es keinen anderen Heimweg gab, denn wir waren hier auf Spaziergängen schon oft gewesen und hatten keinen anderen Heimweg als diesen gefunden. Ich beschloss also, mich durch diesen aufgeweichten Boden zu bewegen, und stellte mir vor, wie meine Halbschuhe und auch die Hosenbeine dann völlig mit Lehmschlamm bedeckt sein würden und wie mühsam es sein würde, dort hindurch zu kommen, zumal diese aufgeweichte Fläche auch noch ständig anstieg und mühsam zu erklimmen war. Da entdeckte ich an einer Stelle eine Gesteinsformation, die in die selbe Richtung führte, aber von Wasser umgeben war. Es waren sehr schön geformte Steine in weichen Wellen und organischen Formen. Ich kletterte ein Stück darin entlang, musste sogar einige Schritte über einen Grat gehen, von dem es rechts und links ziemlich steil abfiel, merkte dann aber, dass dieser Weg nicht weiter führte und ich zum Ausgangspunkt zurück musste, um dann doch durch den Schlamm zu gehen. Da fand ich ein wunderschönes, vom Wasser in den Zeiten zu ganz weichen und eleganten Formen geschliffenes Steinstück, an dem parallel gratartig hervorstehend Steinstreifen umliefen, die aus härterem Gestein und darum stehen geblieben waren. So war ein tastbares Muster wie bei manchen indischen Stoffen entstanden. Das Ganze wirkte sehr elegant. An einer Stelle hatte sich eine Vertiefung gebildet. Der ganze Stein mit seinen eleganten Formen war wunderschön tastbar, und ich beschloss, ihn mitzunehmen, obwohl ich den schwierigen Weg vor mir hatte. In diesem Moment kam ein kleines Geschwisterpaar, zwei Kinder, vorbei, und ich hörte den Jungen zum Mädchen sagen, dass man hier keine Steine sammeln dürfe, weil das Gebiet geschützt sei. Ich dachte noch, den Stein trotzdem mitzunehmen, als ich entdeckte, dass in der Mulde des Steins ein kleines weiches moluskenartiges Tier sass. Ich schleuderte es schaudernd hinaus und sah nun wie es auf dem Boden sass und kleine wurzelartige Füsschen bewegte. Ich überlegte, dass es vielleicht ohne seine Steinwohnung nicht leben könne, und beschloss, das schöne Steinstück neben es an den Boden zu legen, damit es wieder hineinkriechen könne. Ich erwachte mit starken Kopfschmerzen. (375 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3540 (1995-02-20, 05:15 - Zürich)Ich war auf einem Gut wie Wittmoldt oder ähnlich. Ich hatte über eine Methode gelesen, wie man sich farbig am Körper bemalen konnte, und wollte dies nun ausprobieren. Dazu musste man sich ganz mit Öl einreiben und dann bemalen und dann in ein Laken einwickeln und etwas darüber ziehen. Dies war aber aus irgend einem Grund so nicht realisierbar, und ich machte es darum in einer anderen Variante, bei der man sich ebenfalls ganz mit Öl einreiben musste, dann aber das Laken bemalte und um sich hüllte. Dies tat ich nun, indem ich mich zuerst einölte, dann farbige Zeichen auf das Laken malte, wie Buchstaben und schlangenförmige Gebilde. Dann wicklete ich das Laken um mich und zog etwas darüber. Dies machte ich auf dem Dachboden des Gutshauses. Mein Zimmer war in der Etage darunter, so dass ich leicht hinauflaufen konnte. So behandelte ich verschiedene Laken nacheinander, die dann auch die Bemalung behalten würden, für die der eigene Körper mit dem Öl sozusagen als Stempel oder Medium diente. Als ich gerade wieder hinaufging, um das letzte Laken so zu behandeln, bemerkte ich, dass Matratzen und bunte Betttücher auf den Flur herausgestellt waren von einem der Mädchen, die wohl putzte. Ich überlegte, dass es meine bunten Bettlaken waren, andere als die weissen, die ich hier gerade behandelte, vbielmehr farbige Betttücher, die ich mit auf die Reise genommen hatte. Es bestand nun die Gefahr, dass sie in die Wäsche des Hauses geraten und dann verschwinden würden, weil die Mädchen nicht wussten, dass sie uns gehörten. Ich musste das unbedingt mit Emme besprechen, die auch da war. Darum kürzte ich bei der Behandlung des letzten weissen Lakens mit den farbigen Zeichen den Prozess ab, indem ich mich diesmal nicht mehr einölte, sondern das frisch bemalte Laken so um mich hüllte. Dann zog ich meine Cordhose über, die ich unterwegs irgendwo hingelegt hatte. Ich konnte hier ganz wie zu Hause mit meinen Kleidern umgehen und sie überall hinlegen. Dann rutschte ich eine Stange hinab, die senkrecht ins untere Stockwerk führte, denn die Treppe war aus irgendeinem Grunde nicht da. Dabei bemerkte ich, dass ich meinen Schlüssel, der eine verschlossene Tür zur Etage öffnen konnte, oben vergessen hatte, kehrte aber nicht zurück, sondern sagte mir, dass ich schon jemand begegnen würde, der einen Schlüssel bei sich hatte. Dann kam mir ein junger Mann, der wie ich auf dem Gut war, entgegen und sagte, man habe sich sehr über die Art gefreut, wie ich die Blumen behandelt und gedüngt hätte. Ich hatte nämlich eigene Blumen in Blumentöpfen, die wir auch dort hatten, bevor sie, wohl für den Winter, abgestellt wurden, mit Dung behandelt und irgendwie zurechtgemacht, was offenbar so ausgefallen war, dass es den Gutsleuten gefiel. Ich sagte zu dem jungen Mann, dass ich gleich wiederkommen würde, und beschloss, ihn um den Schlüssel für die Tür zu bitten. Ich war sehr besorgt, dass unsere farbigen Laken und die Matratzen, die ja auf unsere Betten gehörten und bequem waren, inzwischen schon weggetragen sein könnten, und erwachte. (498 words)

Es waren Kunstwerke, die zu irgend einem Anlass geschaffen waren, ein Fest, eine Gründung oder ein Jubiläum. Sie waren ganz verschieden gestaltet und meist in Hülsen aus Karton oder leinenbezogenem Material. Sie waren irgendwie oberflächengestaltet, zum Teil wohl aus Kupfer, das kunstvoll oxydiert war, oder trugen kleine Zeichen wie Buchstaben und ähnliches, wie Bilder von Tapies, oder sie waren emailliert und mit Farbnuancen. Einige waren sehr schön. Die Frau des Hauses brachte mir immer neue zum betrachten heraus, die frisch eingetroffen waren. Ich konnte mir eine aussuchen und überlegte noch, welche auf die Dauer am schönsten sein würde, als ich aufwachte. (110 words)

Es war ein Text, der von griechischen Worten oder Texten handelte und alles Griechische unübersetzt und in griechischen Buchstaben geschrieben enthielt Ich stellte zu meinem Vergnügen fest, dass ich alles gut und flüssig lesen konnte und viele der griechischen Worte verstand.

Dieser Spruch aus dem Märchen spielte irgendwie in dem Traum eine Rolle. Es war offenbar eine Kriminalgeschichte, wo der Spruch gleichsam den Schlüssel bildete. Eine Bombe wurde offenbar dadurch ausgelöst oder konnte durch seinen Klang ausgelöst werden, wohl wenn er von einer bestimmten Stimme gesprochen wurde. Ich musste den Spruch, glaube ich, auch in das Mikrophon eines Kommissars sprechen, aber wohl mehr, um ihm etwas zu erklären. Ich merkte bald, dass die Geschichte etwas mit meiner Tochter Bille und ihrem Mann Martin zu tun hatte, sagte das aber nicht. Es war im Traum so, als wenn der Spruch aus dem Märchen "Mine Fruu de Ilsebill" stammte, während er in Wirklichkeit, glaube ich, aus einem anderen Märchen mit plattdeutschen Versen kommt. Ich wachte auf mit der Überlegung, dass meine Stimme die Bombe auslösen könne und man darum jetzt sofort handeln müsse, um das zu verhindern. (164 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3545 (1995-02-25, 01:20 - Zürich)Traum von einer englischen Prinzessin, die man in einer Fernsehsendung sah, die von ihr und ihrem Leben handelte. Man sah Bilder von früher, wo sie glanzvoll angezogen war und in einer Flimmerwelt lebte. Dann aber hatte es Skandale gegeben und Schwierigkeiten mit dem Prinzen, und schliesslich war die Ehe getrennt. Nun gab es einen Sprung in die Gegenwart. Man sah eine einfache Wohnung und hörte den Reporter einen deutschen Namen sagen. Offenbar war sie vor ihrer Heirat eine Deutsche gewesen oder hatte jetzt einen Deutschen geheiratet. Er befragte sie nun über ihr jetztiges Leben, und man sah die schlicht aber geschmackvoll eingerichtete Wohnung, in der nicht die geringsten Spuren ihrer englischen Prinzessinenzeit und der Glimmerwelt zu finden waren. Sie sagte, daraufhin befragt, dass sie die beiden Welten sorgfältig trennen müsse, um leben zu können. Deshalb hätte sie alle Spuren entfernt. So ginge es. Und sie machte auch einen relativ glücklichen Eindruck. Aber man merkte, wie sehr sie einen Teil von sich gleichsam hatte aussperren müssen und eigentlich eine Doppelexistenz lebte, in der der andere Teil ihrer Wirklichkeit und Vergangenheit gleichsam ausgeschlossen war. Das bedrückte mich bei der Vorstellung, wie es sein müsse, so zu leben, sehr. Und ich erwachte mit diesem bedrückten Gefühl, dass sich erst legte, als ich richtig begriff, dass es ein Traum gewesen war. (217 words)

Der Rest des Textes war vollkommen unlesbar und bestand aus sinnlosen Silben und Worten, weil offenbar das Alphabet beim Druck dieses Textes systematisch verschoben war. Ich überlegte, ob ich an den Verlag schreiben solle, sie sollten doch einmal eine Übersetzung dieses Textes schicken. Dann bekam ich Zweifel, ob eigentlich der Name Blendenberg richtig geschrieben war, und erwachte. (70 words)

Sie legt sich neben mich aufs Bett und ich bewundere ihre wunderschönen nackten weissen Arme und stelle mir vor, wie es wäre, wenn sie ganz nackt wäre. Ich liege zwischen ihr und dem Mann auf dem Bett. Es ist eine sehr entspannte und natürliche ungenierte Situation. Dann sehe ich ihre mit Schreibmaschine geschriebenen Gedichte. In dem Text sind aber einzelne Worte mit der Hand geschrieben und zwar in meiner Handschrift. Den Inhalt der Gedichte, die ich im Traum las, habe ich vergessen. (103 words)

Als ich schon begann, mir Sorgen zu machen, hörte ich plötzlich einen Aufschrei einer anderen Mitbewohnerin. Sie hatte ihn ermordet auf der Speichertreppe gefunden. Ich überlegte, was zu tun sei, und erwachte sehr beunruhigt und brauchte eine Weile, um ganz zu realisieren, dass es ein Traum sei. Im Erwachen hatte ich noch darüber nachgedacht, dass die Mörder vielleicht noch im Hause sein könnten und deshalb Vorsicht geboten sei. (87 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3551 (1995-02-28, 05:50 - Freiburg)Es folgte darauf noch ein dritter Traum, in dem es um eine kleine silberne wie ein Kunstwerk gestaltete Kugel ging, die eigentlich mit kleinen Löchern als Salzstreuer gedacht war, die man aber auch als Kunstwerk oder als Anhänger ansehen konnte. Ich fragte deshalb den Besitzer, ob er mir auch eine solche beschaffen könne. Er stimmte nach einigem Zögern zu. Aber als ich ihn nach dem Preis fragte, erfuhr ich, dass die kleine Kugel etwa drei- oder vierhundert Mark kosten würde. Das war mir dann doch zu teuer und ich sagte, dass er sie doch nicht für mich kaufen solle. (99 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3552 (1995-02-28, 06:00 - Freiburg)Eine Plastik, die aus verschieden geformten Steinplatten bestand, die von Löchern durchbohrt waren. Eigentlich waren es Versteinerungen wie die, die wir Löchersteine nannten. Sie waren an einem Gestell aus Draht und Metallstangen aufgehängt und das Ganze wirkte sehr schön. Es waren zunächst drei solche Steinplatten gewesen und wir hatten eine vierte besonders schön und archaisch wirkende hinzugekauft. Aber nun begann das Gestell, sich unter dem Gewicht zu biegen. Ich ging deshalb mit der Plastik in das Geschäft zurück, wo sie und auch die vierte Platte gekauft waren, um die Verkäuferinnen dort zu fragen. Die waren aber sehr beschäftigt und wenig hilfsbereit. Darum ging ich mit der Plastik an die Seite und begann, den gewundenen Drahtknoten selbst zu öffnen, was nötig war, um die vierte Platte wieder abzunehmen. Das gelang mir auch und bei der Gelegenheit sah ich, dass ich auch noch runde Platten aus schönem Holz mit daran gehängt hatte. Vielleicht waren auch sie es, die das Gewicht zu sehr erhöht hatten. Nun wusste ich aber nicht mehr, wie ich den Drahtknoten, der ein Bestandteil der Plastik war, wieder schliessen sollte. Ich wollte deshalb zu einer anderen solchen Plastik gehen, die dort an einer anderen Stelle in dem Raum stand, um zu sehen, wie es gemacht war. Ich hatte aber einige Sachen von mir an der Stelle, wo ich war, ausgelegt und wusste nicht, ob ich sie allein lassen konnte. Ich sah, dass einem Fahrrad, das dort stand, der Sattel fehlte, und befürchtete erst, dass es mein mitgebrachtes Fahrrad sei, merkte aber dann, dass es ein anderes war und der Besitzer den Sattel offenbar selbst abgenommen hatte, damit er nicht gestohlen würde. Daraus schloss ich, dass man sich hier vor Dieben schützen müsse. Die Fahrräder gehörten in ihrer metallischen Gestalt und mit den organisch geformten Satteln irgendwie mit zu den Plastiken, gleichsam wie objets trouvées. Bei dem Dilemma, wie ich gleichzeitig meine Sachen bewachen und die an einem anderen Ort stehende Plastik betrachten sollte, um zu sehen, wie ich den Drahtknoten wiederherstellen solle, erwachte ich.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3555 (1995-03-02, 02:00 - Freiburg)Bille musste operiert werden und Tina war Chirurgin. Es war nicht klar, ob Tina selbst das machen sollte oder die Oberärztin oder sonst jemand. Ich wusste auch nicht, ob ich sie das jetzt fragen sollte oder nicht, um sie nicht zu verunsichern. Ich war sehr beunruhigt. Es war auch nicht klar, ob sie die Operation in ihrer Wohnung durchführen wollte oder in einer Klinik, was mir nötig schien, weil doch auch eine Intensivstation da sein muss. Dann waren wir aber in einer Klinik und Bille lag in einem Zimmer, wo Belli bei ihr war und sie versorgte. Emme und die andern waren in einem anderen Raum und ich hörte Emmes Stimme, konnte sie aber nicht finden, als ich auf dem Flur der Klinik umherlief und dem Klang der Stimme folgte. Dann hiess es aber auch, die Oberärztin sei da gewesen.Ich konnte nicht weiter in die Räume eindringen, weil ich nur ein Nachthemd anhatte, und beschloss, mich erst anzuziehen. Dazu musste ich in das Zimmer zurück, in dem Bille lag.und Belli bei ihr sass. Es waren zwei Türen nebeneinander, und ich war unsicher, welches die richtige war. Schliesslich öffnete ich eine, war von einer Lampe in der Nähe des Bettes geblendet, so dass ich nicht richtig hineinsehen konnte, hörte aber fremde Stimmen und entschuldigte mich. Im Begriff, die andere Tür zu öffnen, bin ich dann aufgewacht. (225 words)

Dann Gespräch mit Moni, die den Gesprächen beim Einüben zugehört hatte. Dabei kamen wir zu dem Schluss, dass die Sexualität viel mehr Metaphysik enthält, als man landläufig denkt. Das Gespräch fand in einer Situation statt, die der Situation nach einer Vorlesung gleicht, wo viele Leute in den Gängen eines Saales sind, und wir standen bei einem grossen, die Breite des Hörsaals einnehmenden Kathedertisch, wie sie in älteren Hörsäle sind. Moni, die eine Arbeit schrieb, fand, dass man diese metaphysische Seite der Sexualität nicht verschweigen dürfe. Eine Frau, die sich am Gespräch beteiligte, hatte das ausgesprochen und Moni sagte: "Das kann man doch auch garnicht". Bei dem Klang dieser Worte wachte ich auf. (127 words)

Hier wachte ich beim Vorlesen auf. Es war ein Brief von Ernst Jünger, den ich gerade mit der Post bekommen hatte und nun begonnen hatte, Emme vorzulesen, zunächst ohne ihr den Namen des Absenders zu nennen. Der Brief bestand aus mehreren ungefalteten Blättern, die in eine Mappe eingelegt waren, die offenbar einen gedruckten Artikel enthielt. Als Datum stand über dem Brief ein Datum aus dem Jahr 1995. Es war ein Dankbrief für einen Brief, den ich ihm zum hundertsten Geburtstag geschrieben hatte. Der Buchstabe G. für Göttingen kam in dem handgeschriebenen Brief mehrfach vor. Er schrieb auch darin, dass ich ihn damals dreimal hintereinander besucht habe. Der Brief enthielt offenbar auch die Wiedergabe von Tagebuchaufzeichnungen, die er sich damals gemacht hatte. Die Handschrift war die Handschrift eines alten Mannes, aber sehr deutlich geschrieben und in dem für ihn typischen Schriftduktus. In der Jahreszahl 1995 war eine Zahl doppelt geschrieben, so dass es eine fünfstellige statt der gemeinten vierstelligen Zahl ergab., die aber trotzdem klar erkennbar war. Ich war sehr gerührt und ergriffen von diesem grossen Brief und bedauerte nach dem Erwachen, dass ich aufgewacht war, ehe ich ihn ganz gelesen hatte. Dabei war es immer noch so, dass der Brief in seiner ganzen Länge für mich Realität war. (227 words)

Die Wurzeln liefen teilweise auch einen Weg entlang bergauf. Teilweise war es auch so, dass ich dem Geschehen ganz von aussen zuschaute. Auch wunderte ich mich garnicht darüber, dass ich ein Baum war, sondern das war ganz selbstverständlich. Ich war aber trotzdem ganz und gar ein Mensch und so, wie ich immer bin. Meine Identität mit dem Baum war irgendwie nur ganz selbstverständlich gegeben. Nach dem Erwachen hatte ich einige Mühe, den Traum zu akzeptieren und entschloss mich nur langsam, ihn aufzuschreiben.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3559 (1995-03-04, 00:00 - Freiburg)Ich beschäftigte mich mit den Ursachen und Problemen schlechter und verbrauchter Luft in den Konzertsälen und anderen Sälen der Stadt und studierte auch handschriftliche Aufzeichnungen, die andere vor mir dazu gemacht hatten, aus denen aber keine Konsequenzen gezogen worden waren und die auch schwer zu entziffern waren, was mir aber gelang, weil ich die Handschriften der Betreffenden kannte. Ich merkte bald, dass es vor allem darauf ankam, bestimmte Fenster und Luken zu öffnen., durch die die verbrauchte Luft schnell abziehen konnte. Das war besonders auch deswegen wichtig, weil sich die Verwendung geräuschvoller Ventilatoren in den Konzertsälen verbot und weil auch nicht viel Geld dafür vorhanden war. Es handelte sich vor allem um zwei übereinander liegende, viel benutzte Säle, und ich fand schnell heraus, wo die zu öffnenden Fenster und Luken waren, die auch so gewählt werden mussten, dass es nicht zog. Das war möglich, wenn im oberen Saal in der Höhe bestimmte Luken geöffnet wurden. Es war aber sehr schwierig, die zuständigen Hauswarte und Logenschliesser davon zu überzeugen, denn sie argumentierten vor allen dagegen mit der Feststellung, dass das noch nie jemand gemacht habe. Ich sagte dagegen, dass zum Beispiel in Strassenbahnen und Autobussen auch oft niemand auf die Idee käme, bestimmte Luken zu öffnen, obwohl die Luft sehr verbraucht sei und die Leute selber darunter litten. Ich musste aber auch Autorität und Energie anwenden, um die Öffnung der Luken zu erzwingen und auch solche Luken einzubeziehen, die nicht den oberen Saal, für den die Betreffenden zuständig waren, sondern auch den darunter gelegenen entlüfteten. Es gelang mir aber und wir erlebten, wie die Luft in den Räumen sich ganz schnell verbesserte. (271 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3560 (1995-03-04, 07:30 - Freiburg)Traum von einer ganz zauberhaften Architektur. Strassen führten durch alte Häuser hindurch, wo sie in Gänge und Treppen übergingen. In einem der Flure hing ein grosses Bild einer aufgestützt liegenden nackten Frau, das im Stil an englische Malerei erinnerte. Kinder eines Kindergartens und ihre Wärterinnen gingen davor vorbei, die alle gleiche gestreifte und gerüschte Kleider anhatten. Sie gingen dem Ausgang zu, kehrten aber auf Geheiss einer Vorsteherin wieder um, weil eines der Kinder offenbar noch nicht abgeholt werden konnte. Es war eine vornehme Gesellschaft. Dann ging ich durch die Gänge weiter und kam auf eine andere, höher gelegene Strasse. Hier sah ich eine wunderbare Kuppel, die nur wenig höher lag als die erhöhte Strasse, und ein Bogen war davor so in kreisförmiger Weise gebildet, dass es ein wunderbares Bild gab, das ich photographieren wollte. Es war aber kein Bild mehr in der Kamera und in meiner Umhängtasche fand ich zwar viele Filme, die aber alle schon belichtet waren. Ich erinnerte mich, dass ich in der Nähe Filme gekauft hatte und dort hingehen und neue kaufen konnte. Vorher aber wollte ich die alten schon belichteten Filme ordnen und numerieren und beschloss, dafür in das Haus zurück zu gehen, wo ich einen Tisch und einen Stuhl davor gesehen hatte. Deshalb ging ich in die etwas tiefer gelegene andere Strasse wieder herab, die so in das Haus führte, wie ich auch das erste mal hineingegangen war. Dann erwachte ich. (236 words)

Ich darf es in einem grossen Korbkinderwagen, wie man ihn in den dreissiger Jahren hatte, spazieren fahren und schiebe den Wagen ganz vorsichtig über die Schwelle der Haustür, dabei die Räder, die jeweils über die Schwelle gehen, anhebend, damit das Baby nicht geweckt oder beunruhigt wird. Vor der Tür begegnet mir der Vater, der einige Sachen bei sich trägt. Ich lobe, auch um ihn zu erfreuen, das Baby. Er aber sagt, er ginge jetzt auf sein anderes Gut, das Stechlin heisst.

Ich hatte dazu einen wie ein Bohrwerkzeug aussehenden Gegenstand in der Hand und beugte mich über den Tresor und machte die entsprechenden Bewegungen, wobei ich mir intensiv vorstelte, dass ich den Tresor auf diese Weise öffnete, und mein Bruder filmte indessen. Ich bewegte mich dabei lebhaft. Als es fertig war und ich mich aufrichtete, fragte ich ihn: "Wie ist es geworden?". Er sagte befriedigt: "Biest", womit er meinte, dass der Einbrecher wie ein raffiniertes Biest aussehe, und fügte hinzu: "Wenn Du dann einen schwarzen Anzug anhast, wird es sehr gut aussehen." Erst jetzt merkte ich, dass ich während der Aufnahmen nackt gewesen war und es nur Probeaufnahmen gewesen waren. Inzwischen liess er die Bilder durchlaufen und ich sah, dass es sehr elegant aussah und die Bewegungen an eine Plastik von Giovanni da Bologna erinnerten. Ich bedauerte, dass es nicht schon die endgültigen Aufnahmen waren, weil sie sehr gelungen waren und sehr tänzerisch aussahen. (170 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3565 (1995-03-07, 06:00 - Freiburg)Harnoncourt hatte ein ganz altes Instrument, das nur ganz wenige Töne machte und sehr viele Obertöne hatte, wie man es früher zum Tanzen verwendet hatte. Er stellte es senkrecht auf, wobei es an irgend einer Vorrichtung befestigt war, und spielte darauf eine sehr eindringliche monotone Musik, die durch die Obertöne erregend wirkte. Das Instrument hatte statt Saiten parallele senkrecht stehende Schienen aus Metall und auch der Bogen war mit Metalldrähten bespannt. Ich stand Harnoncourt gegenüber und hörte ihm lange zu. Dann kam Emme, die nun ebenfalls zuhörte und tanzende Bewegungen machte. Dann gaben wir uns die Hand und begannen zu tanzen. Emme wusste die richtigen Schritte zu dem alten Tanz, während ich sie nicht kannte und nur andeutungsweise Schritte machte, die irgendwie zur Musik passten. Im Forttanzen winkten wir dann Harnoncourt zu, der während des ganzen Spiels ein ernstes und ekstatisch wirkendes Gesicht mit weit geöffneten Augen machte, wie er es oft auch beim Dirigieren macht. Während des Wegtanzens bin ich dann erwacht. Es war noch eine andere Szene vorhergegangen, wo Harnoncourt an der selben Stelle im Freien in der Landschaft eine Probe mit dem Orchester machte. Es waren hauptsächlich Streicher, die Barockmusik machten. Als er sie entliess sagte er, sie müssten noch dableiben, weil sie nachher noch gebraucht würden. Als jemand fragte, wozu, sagte er, weil eine Kundin ihre Bassgeige ausprobieren wollte und sie dazu die Begleitung spielen müssten. (230 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3568 (1995-03-09, 06:00 - Zürich)Emme und ich waren in London bei Hofe. Abends um halb sieben war ein Essen. Wir waren noch im Park und dachten, dass das sicher nicht pünktlich anfangen würde. Plötzlich kam mir der Gedanke, es war schon genau halb sieben, dass vielleicht die Königin da sein und es ganz pünktlich anfangen würde und es furchtbar unhöflich sein würde, da zu spät zu kommen. Wir müssten also ganz schnell hinaufgehen. Aber wir waren garnicht richtig angezogen. Ich hatte wie immer mein blaues Hemd und keinen Schlips an. Auch hatten wir grosse Taschen mit Badesachen und Ähnlichem dabei. Die konnten wir doch nicht mitnehmen. Aber wo sollten wir sie lassen? Es gab zwar irgendwo Schliessfächer, aber die waren so weit weg, dass wir noch viel mehr Zeit verlieren würden. Ich sagte zu Emme, wir müssten vielleicht die Taschen im Park verstecken. Sie sagte, dann müsse sie vorher noch ihre Handtasche hinausnehmen. Diese war in ihrer Tasche tief unten unter den anderen Dingen versteckt, so dass man erst die ganze Tasche hätte ausräumen müssen. Dann Szenenwechsel: Wir waren jetzt dort im Park beim Johannisbeeren-Pflücken. Jeder hatte einen Eimer. Die Eimer waren schon übervoll. Ich sagte zu Emme, wir sollten sie lieber nicht überfüllen, weil das zu unverschämt aussehen würde, denn eigentlich gehörten die Johannisbeeren der Königin, und wir mussten noch einen Weg durch die Öffentlichkeit damit machen. Andere Szenen waren vorhergegangen, die ich nur noch ungenau erinnere und in denen auch Prinz Charles eine Rolle spielte. So betätigte er sich als eine Art Fernfahrer und ich fuhr hinter ihm her. Dann war in einer anderen Szene teilweise auch ich selbst der Prinz und wollte beweisen, dass ich auch ganz alltägliche Dinge machen könne, und schnallte einen Balken oder eine Wurzel eines Baumes mit einem Lederband und meinem Schlüsselring unter Wasser fest. Das war auch sehr schön gelungen, aber ich musste nun den Schlüsselring ganz schnell herausziehen, weil wir doch zu dem Essen mussten, und es war viel schwieriger, ihn herauszubringen, als es gewesen war, ihn hinein zu ziehen. Aber mit grosser Konzentration gelang es. In einer anderen Szene war Bille da, die ich umarmte und küsste. In einer der Szenen bei Hofe stand auf einer Fensterbank eine tönerne Ente oder Porzellanente, die wir spielerisch hin und her bewegten. Aber man musste aufpassen, dass sie nicht herunterfiel, wenn man den Fensterflügel bewegte. (388 words)

Ich war gerade wach geworden und merkte, dass Emme im Dunklen im Schlaf aufstand und begann, sich irgendwie anzuziehen, wobei sie die Sachen zum Teil richtig anzog, zum Teil irgendwie um sich zu wickeln schien. Man merkte, dass sie im Schlaf weggehen wollte. Schliesslich hatte sie sich so weit angezogen, dass sie offenbar sich ausgehfertig fand, und ging zielstrebig und schnell zur Tür. Ich sprang auf, ging hinterher und sagte: "Aufwachen, aufwachen, aufwachen", das Wort immer wiederholend, um sie sanft zu wecken. Sie war schon zur Tür raus gegangen, als sie anfing, aufzuwachen. Ich führte sie nun beruhigend ins Zimmer zurück, machte irgendwie Licht und sagte beruhigend, dass wir nun mal sehen wollten, wie weit ihr das Anziehen gelungen sei. Bestimmte Kleidungsstücke hatte sie ganz richtig angezogen, so eine Art Pullover und eine schal-artige Jacke. Ich sagte: "So weit ist es schon gelungen" und erwachte. (154 words)

Ich drehte mich, um zu sehen, ob er in diesem Fall nicht absetzten würde, und vor allem, um ganz schnell den Stopp-Knopf zu drücken. Zu meinem Erstaunen war aber überhaupt kein Tonabnehmer zu sehen, obwohl man noch das Geräusch hörte. Ich dachte, dass er vielleicht eingezogen sei, konnte mir aber nicht vorstellen, wohin, da dafür gar kein Platz vorhanden war. Es war nun höchste Zeit, den Stopp-Knopf zu drücken, und ich hoftte dass dann der Tonarm wieder herauskommen würde. Aber ich hatte Lederhandschuhe an, die meine Hände ungeschickt machten, und konnte ausserdem den Stoppknopf auch garnicht finden. Ich versuchte nun, die Handschuhe abzuziehen, sie sassen aber völlig fest an den Händen und ich musste sie gleichsam von jedem Finger einzeln abziehen. (155 words)

Wir sassen auf dem Bett und hatten die Türme unmittelbar vor uns. Ich erinnerte mich daran, wie ich früher hier gesessen hatte, oft auch an sehr heissen Sommertagen. Jetzt war es noch eher frühlingshaft kühl.Ich war sehr ergriffen von dieser unmittelbaren Gegenwart der Vergangenheit in der Erinnerung. Wir hatten uns vorher, wohl in einem Verkehrsmittel durch die Stadt bewegt und die Türme aus jeweils anderer Perspektive gesehen. Aber jetzt waren sie sozusagen richtig, in dem altvertrauten Anblick und der genau richtigen Perspektive. In den vorhergegangenen Szenen hatten wir auch irgendwo an einer Haltestelle gestanden, und ich hatte mir deren Lage in der Stadt vorgestellt, wobei da die Stadt auch etwas von der Topographie von Schwerin hatte. Die unmittelbare Präsenz der früheren Zeit in dem Zimmer, wo wir auf dem Bett sassen und die Türme direkt vor uns hatten, war ein unheimliches und schönes Erlebnis und Gefühl, und ich habe dieses Gefühl irgendwie auch jetzt noch beim Aufschreiben des Traums.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3574 (1995-03-15, 01:20 - Zürich)Gespräche mit Gadamer. In Bezug auf den Satz "Das Wesen der Sprache ist das Gespräch" fragte er dabei plötzlich: "Was ist eigentlich das Wesentliche, die Sprache oder das Gespräch?" Die Antwort schien mir schwierig, denn beides gehörte doch zusammen, war eine Einheit. Ich überlegte, was er mit dieser Unterscheidung wohl meinte, vielleicht mit Sprache hier unseren Bezug zur Welt und zum Sein in der Sprache und mit Gespräch eben die Gesprächsnatur der Sprache. Dann lagen wir bei unserem Gespräch auf Couchen in unserer Wohnung. Diese waren sehr flach auf dem Boden und in einer Art Flur aufgestellt, zu dem eine Treppe von unten hinauf führte. Ich lehnte mich an das Geländer, das das Podest am Kopf der Treppe umgab, auf dem meine Couch stand. Da gab das Geländer nach und fiel ins Treppenhaus. Die Pfosten, an denen es befestigt war, blieben aber stehen und würden mich gehalten haben, wenn ich mich nachts im Schlaf an das Geländer gelehnt hätte. Ich wäre also auch dann nicht herabgefallen. Die Sache war also nicht weiter schlimm. Jemand, der auch dabei war, fand aber doch, dass man sogleich etwas machen müsse, und wollte Handwerker oder Handwerkszeug holen, während ich einfach das Gespräch mit Gadamer weiterführte. Dann gingen wir auch im Gespräch durch die Strasse auf dem Weg zu einem Kaffeestand an kleinen runden Tischen vor einem Geschäft. Gadamer fand aber schon vorher Tische dieser Art, aber ganz aus Holz, am Rande der Strasse bei einer Baustelle und blieb einfach dort stehen. Ich legte das Brot auf den ziemlich wackeligen Tisch neben mir, dessen Platte nicht ganz richtig auf dem Tischbein befestigt war. Gadamer schien die ganze Improvisation nicht zu stören. Er wollte offenbar nicht vor dem Geschäft mit dem Kaffeestand, der ein Stück weiter an der Strasse war, stehen, weil es dort lärmig war und man sich weniger gut unterhalten konnte. Ich sagte, ich werde also schnell dort hinlaufen und für uns Kaffee holen. Er sagte: "Warum denn, wir haben doch schon Kaffee". Jetzt bemerkte ich, dass tatsächlich schon Kaffee in unsren Bechern war, und wir einfach dort in der Baustellenlandschaft stehen bleiben und uns ungestört weiter unterhalten konnten. Dann waren wir auf dem Rückweg zur Wohnung und Gadamer sagte: "Sollen wir auf dem Rückweg den direkten Weg gehen, oder einen Bogen durch den Wald machen. Sie sind nun alt, sie müssen sich entscheiden". Dabei meinte er aber nicht etwa, dass wir deswegen den direkten Weg gehen sollten, der eine Strasse entlang ging, sondern offenbar schwebte ihm vor, dass der Bogen durch den Wald für mich besser sei, weil er Musse zum Nachdenken und für unser Gespräch gibt. Er trug während des Weges einen Umhängebeutel bei sich und eine kleine Ledertasche, in der seine Sachen waren. Das schien ihn nicht zu belasten und er hatte es offenbar für eine peripatetisch Existenz so eingerichtet. Er sagte noch, dass ich eine Wolfsnatur habe, womit er meinte, dass ich genügend zäh für solche Spaziergänge sei. (488 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3575 (1995-03-16, 00:50 - Zürich)Ich war verreist und wohnte in einem Hotel oder Studentenwohnheim. In dem Zimmer waren noch mehrere Studenten untergebracht. Nach einer Weile merkte ich aus ihren Gesprächen, dass sie Psychologen aus Freiburg waren und unmittelbar vor dem Examen standen, denn sie unterhielten sich über die Prüfungen, die ihnen bevorstanden und die Prüfer. Nach einiger Zeit gab ich zu erkennen, dass ich auch Psychologe war und in Freiburg studiert hatte, und nach einer weiteren Weile sagte ich auch, dass ich selber etwa zweitausend Leute geprüft hätte. Sie fragten mich nach verschiedenen Prüfern und ihrer Art zu prüfen, auch nach der Hiltmann. Es stellte sich heraus, dass es eigentlich keinen Prüfer gab, dessen Prüfungen nicht für die Geprüften mit irgend welchen Problemen verbunden waren. Dann gingen wir runter zum Essen. Es gab zwei Treppenhäuser, ein übliches und ein kleines Wendeltreppenhaus. Die Studentin, mit der ich gerade sprach, wählte dieses und ich folgte ihr. Es war sehr angenehm, die stets im Kreis geführten Treppen herab zu laufen, gleichsam wie in einer Spiralbewegung herab zu gleiten. Sie sagte, dass sie in Freiburg bei einer Kirche gewohnt hatte. Ich fragte, welche es gewesen sei. Sie drehte sich im Herabgehen um und stiess mich halb vorwurfsvoll, halb humorvoll an, denn sie hatte gerade vorher gesagt, dass sie in dieser Kirche auch gearbeitet habe. Ich aber hatte das bereits wieder ganz vergessen. Es war die Christuskirche oder die Johanneskirche gewesen. Ich erklärte ihr, dass das eben das schon vom Alter schlechte Neugedächtnis sei und dass mir sowas oft passiere. Inzwischen waren wir schon weiter nach unten gelangt und hatten etwa zwei drittel des Weges durch das sehr vielgeschossige Haus hinter uns. Jetzt kam das Gespräch darauf, dass bei dem Essen auch über das unmittelbar bevorstehende Examen gesprochen und auch die Examensarbeiten zurückgegeben würden. Ich hatte auch zwei Arbeiten benotet, diese aber jetzt nicht mit herunter genommen. Sie sagte, ich könne diese ruhig noch holen, es finge doch nie pünktlich an. Ich rechnete mir aber aus, dass ich, wenn ich jetzt wieder hinauf und dann wieder hinuntergehen müsste, auf jeden Fall zu spät kommen würde. Auch hatte ich die Nummer unseres Zimmers bereits wieder vergessen und auch die Etage nicht mehr richtig im Kopf, so dass ich lange brauchen würde, es zu finden. Ich sagte darum, ich wolle lieber ganz mit herabkommen und vielleicht später in einer Pause noch einmal heraufgehen. In einer vorhergegangenen Traumszne war es um die Orientierung in der Stadt gegangen, die mir noch ziemlich fremd war und deren Strassenbahnlinien und ihren Verlauf ich noch nicht richtig kannte. Ich musste offenbar noch irgendwann woanders hinfahren und machte mir Sorgen, ob ich diesen Weg finden würde. Dann bin ich noch bei dem Treppenherabsteigen aufgewacht. (447 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3576 (1995-03-16, 05:50 - Zürich)Hörte ein wundervolles Barockkonzert mit einem sehr schönen Orchester und Trompete, die wohl von Maurice André gespilet wurde. Besonders schön war der Schluss, wo die Töne in einer grossen Vielfalt gleichsam nebeneinander standen und sich im Verklingen zu einer faszinierenden Einheit zusammen schlossen. Ich liess sie noch eine Weile in mir nachklingen, ehe ich die Hände zum Klatschen hob und in den Saal blickte. Da traf mein Blick einen Mann, der auf der Galerie sass und den Kopfe seitlich so auf die Brüstung gelegt hatte, dass er ganz entspannt hören und zugleich in den Saal schauen konnte. Er lächelte mir zu, als ich sozusagen aus der Musik "aufwachte". Der Klang des Orchesters und der Trompete erinnerte im Stil an Harnoncourt. Ich hörte den Zusammenklang der Töne noch deutlich im Erwachen und er wirkte in seiner Harmonie nach. Als ich aufstand, um den Traum aufzuschreiben, sah ich, dass es draussen weiss von Neuschnee war.

Vorher hatte ich ein Telephongespräch für Hf mit seiner Freundin Lille vermittelt, die weit weg in Asien oder Amerika war. Er bekam zuerst keine Verbindung, weil er vergessen hatte, einen Knopf am Telephon zu drücken, was ich dann für ihn tat, worauf er ausrief: "Lille bist Du endlich da", woraus ich entnahm, dass die Verbindung nun geklappt hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3578 (1995-03-18, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich lebte auf einem Flugplatz, ein bisschen wie ein Landstreicher, hatte dort aber auch meinen Laptop, auf dem ich im Freien an einem Tisch sitzend schrieb, und nahm häufig ein Bad in einer Badewanne, die dort im Freien zur öffentlichen Benutzung stand. Dafür hatte ich auch Badeschaum bei mir, den ich schon beim Einlaufen des Wassers in die Wanne tat. Ich hatte auch einen kleinen Photoapparat bei mir, mit dem ich Aufnahmen von der schönen Landschaft machte. Irgendwann kam jemand, der fand, dass ich mich zu sehr dort eingenistet hätte, und wohl auch befürchtete, dass meine Aufnahmen Spionagezwecken dienten. Es kamen dann Leute, die mich bei sich wohnen lassen wollten, und meine Sachen wurden dorthin abtransportiert. Es waren schon viele Dinge, die sich dort angesammelt hatten. Zum Schluss, als ich nachsah, ob auch nichts zurückgeblieben sei, fand ich noch meinen Regenschirm, den ich irgendwo hingelegt hatte und nun an mich nahm, und meinen Mantel, den ich anzog. Dann war noch eine schmale, mehr hohe als breite Kiste da, in der ich immer überall meine Sachen aufgehoben hatte, aus schönem Kistenholz, auf deren Deckel Chicago stand. Ich sagte zu einer Frau, die bei mir war, ob ich nicht die auch wieder mitnehmen solle und sie sagte: "Warum nicht". Ich überlegte, wie ich sie am besten unter den Arm nehmen könne, und erwachte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3579 (1995-03-19, 06:00 - Zürich)Wir wollten unseren schönen grossen Waldspaziergang machen. Es war ein Weg, den man etwas in der Landschaft und im Wald suchen musste, vor allem bei Abzweigungen. Es war auf jeden Fall ein langer Weg, der viel durch den Wald und wohl auch durch feuchtes Gelände führte, wo man die feuchten Stellen umgehen musste. Mein Vater war auch dabei. Bille, die uns diesmal führen sollte, ging etwas vor mir, mein Vater noch weiter vorne mit jemand, mit dem er ins Gespräch vertieft war. Wir gingen noch auf der Strasse, von der wir dann nach links abbiegen mussten, um in den Wald zu kommen. Aber Bille ging an der Stelle, die ich für die richtige hielt, weiter. Ich dachte, dass ich mich vielleicht geirrt habe, aber bald führte die Strasse durch unbekanntes Gelände und ich rief Bille zu, ob sie nicht meine, dass wir hätten schon etwas vorher abbiegen müssen. Sie antwortete, dass sie es auch denke, aber Vater sei immer weiter gelaufen und es sei ihr egal. Ich fand es aber schade, wenn wir unseren schönen Weg verfehlen würden, und rief meinen weiter vorne gehenden Vater an, indem ich laut "Vater" rief. Er hörte zuerst nicht, weil er ganz ins Gespräch vertieft war, und blieb erst bei noch weiterem Rufen stehen. Ich sagte, dass wir doch hätten früher abbiegen müssen, und es zeigte sich, dass er garnicht wusste, oder garnicht realisiert hatte, wo wir lang gehen wollten. Er wollte offenbar einfach der Landstrasse folgen. Bille sagte vor sich hin: Er will uns offenbar dahin führen, wo an diesem Sonntag auch alle Schulklassen hingehen. Es war anscheinend ein Aussichtsturm. Irgendwie war vom Säntis die Rede. Ich überlegte, dass wir, um unseren Weg zu finden, nun ein Stück auf der Landstrasse zurückgehen müssten und wachte auf. Draussen war starker Sturm, dessentwegen ich schon in der Nacht sehr unruhig geschlafen hatte. (307 words)

Es war auch ein Klo da, das zwar in einer Ecke etwas abseits stand, aber keine Wände hatte, sondern zum Saal hin offen war. Ich musste ziemlich viel dort hin. Dann wieder gemeinsame Wanderschaft und an deren Ende Rast in einem andern Hause. Die anderen hatten alle irgendwelche Essvorräte bei sich, ich aber nicht. Noch war das nicht schlimm, aber wenn die Wanderschaft noch lange weiter ginge, würde ich Hunger bekommen. Dann andere Szene, in der Emme und ich nebeneinander sassen und assen. Ich fütterte Emme mit der Gabel mit Fleischstückchen, hatte aber, da ich die Gabel in der linken Hand hielt, Schwierigkeiten, diese richtig zu ihrem Mund zu führen. Erwachen mit Bauchschmerzen. Draussen Neuschnee. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3581 (1995-03-20, 07:15 - Zürich)Ich sass in einem Saal an einem langen Tisch in einer Tischgesellschaft mit Heidegger beim Essen. Neben dem Tisch war auch ein Klo, nur von einem leichten Vorhang umgeben, das die Mitglieder der Tischgesellschaft benutzten. Auch Heidegger ging dort hin, und auch ich benutzte es. Es wäre irgendwie die Möglichkeit gewesen, noch eine zweite Lage Vorhang um das Klo zu ziehen, aber niemand tat es, auch Heidegger nicht, und darum tat ich es auch nicht. (75 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3582 (1995-03-21, 04:15 - Zürich)Wir waren zusammen mit Gerhard Schmidtchen in einem grossen Saal. Er war gerade mit der Vorbereitung einer Bilder-Ausstellung in einer anderen Stadt, wohl in Berlin, beschäftigt. Es war eine Ausstellung von Städtebildern in verschiedenen Stilen, darunter auch Bilder von Feininger und andere, wohl mehr impressionistische Bilder. Auch Urs Imoberdorf war in dem Saal. Er hatte sich ein Bild vom Schweriner Schloss mit seinen Türmen und Kuppeln gekauft, das er bei sich hatte und am anderen Ende des Saals aufhängte oder aufstellte. Plötzlich kam Gerhard Schmidtchen spontan die Idee, ob man das Bild nicht auch in seine Ausstellung aufnehmen könne, und er sagte das zu Urs Imoberdorf, der sich sichtlich darüber freute und zugleich fragte: "Passt das denn überhaupt in die Ausstellung?" Gerhard Schmidtchen antwortete: "Da wollen wir doch mal den Detlev fragen. Der weiss so etwas doch immer gut". Ich war noch am anderen Ende des Saals mit irgend etwas beschäftigt und blickte nun auf, um zu dem Bild, das jetzt noch in der Ferne für mich war, zu schauen, denn ich hatte es bisher ja nur einmal und sehr flüchtig gesehen. Das Bild wirkte aus der Ferne stark abstrahiert und sehr dynamisch. Die Kuppeln und Türme waren gleichsam in Farblinien und farbiges Licht aufgelöst. Es war ein Bild von sehr guter Qualität und sehr lebendig und eindrucksvoll. Ich sagte: "Es scheint mir irgendwie zu Feininger und auch zu den impressionistischen Bildern zu passen". Ich näherte mich ihnen nun, um das Bild genauer zu betrachten. Pflanzen waren am Rande des Saales, in dem auch ein künstlicher See war. Zwischen beiden musste man auf dem Weg zu den Anderen und zu dem Bild hindurchgehen, wobei der gebliebene Weg zum Teil schmal war und man mit den Füssen die Blätter der Pflanzen zur Seite schieben musste. So mich nähernd richtete ich während des ganzen Weges meinen Blick weiter auf das Bild, das mir in seiner Dynamik und dem Grad seiner Abstraktion imponierte. Es war wie eine Erscheinung und gab doch das Schloss wieder. Plötzlich, als ich dem Bild schon recht nahe war, merkte ich, dass das, was ich mit meinem Blick fixiert und für das Bild gehalten hatte, garnicht das Bild war, sondern eine grosse, wohl tropische Pflanze mit vielen senkrechten linienartigen Blättern, in deren Gesamterscheinung, die sehr dynamisch war, ich das Bild des Schweriner Schlosses hineingesehen hatte. Ich konnte das auch jetzt beim unmittelbaren Anblick noch nachvollziehen, hatte aber eine lebhafte und zum runden schlossähnlichen Komplex geformte Pflanze vor mir. Ich hatte also, diese für das Bild haltend, eine Art Vision von dem Schweriner Schloss in künstlerischer Verwandlung eines Malers gehabt. Das wirkliche Bild des Schlosses, das Urs Imoberdorf gekauft hatte, stand etwas weiter hinten, und er und Gerhard Schmidtchen standen davor und sprachen miteinnander. Es war ein viel realistischeres Bild, die Kuppeln und Türme gleichsam wie plastisch gestaltet, und anders als auf dem Bild, das ich in der Erscheinung der Pflanze gesehen hatte, die ja übrigens, wie das wirkliche Schloss auch, am Rande des Wassers stand, das ja als Teich in dem Saal war. Die beiden hatten natürlich von meiner Verwechslung nichts gemerkt, aber ich kam, mich weiter nähernd, zu dem Schluss, dass ich an meiner Aussage, dass das Bild in die Ausstellung passe, festhalten konnte, und erwachte. Die Türme des Schweriner Schlosses auf dem Bild das Urs Imoberdorf im Traum gekauft hatte, wirkten auf dem Bild irgendwie gotisch, also auch verwandelt, denn sie hatten Krabben wie gotische Türme.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3583 (1995-03-22, 04:50 - Zürich)Ich betrachtete ein Buch, in dem offenbar Zeitdokumente aus dem Leben eines Menschen abgebildet waren. Es schien eine Art Biographie zu sein. Viel Handschriften waren darin, auch Briefumschläge und manches nur Gekritzlete wie Zeichnungen beim Telephonieren. Dann eine ganze Reihe von Briefumschlägen mit der handschriftlichen Adresse von Jürg Willi. Es schien mir ungeheuer interessant, so die Spuren und Zeugnisse aus der Zeit eines Menschen zu sehen. Es hatte eine grosse Dichte und Präsenz. Eine neue Art, eine Biographie darzustellen durch Zeitspuren. Plötzlich merkte ich, dass das, was ich in der Hand hatte, die Betreuungsakte der Lizentiatsarbeit eines meiner Studenten war. So auch die Briefe an Jürg Willi verständlich, über dessen Arbeiten offenbar die Lizentiatsarbeit geschrieben war. Vorher andere Szene: Ich hatte ein Zimmer am Ende eines langen Ganges und stand vor dem Spiegel und betrachtete mich nackt. Dann sah ich, dass ganz am anderen, gegenüberliegenden Ende des langen Ganges auch ein Zimmer war, in dem Bille wohnte und ebenfalls vor dem Spiegel stand und sich nackt betrachtete. Die beiden Zimmertüren standen offen. (172 words)

Alles andere habe ich vergessen, aber dieser Satz war noch da, als ich aufwachte. Ich überlegte im langsamen Erwachen, was man nun tun müsse, damit sie weggehe, ohne mich zu stechen und dass ich den Kopf nicht bewegen dürfe, und blieb eine Weile mit ganz ruhigem Kopf liegen, bis ich völlig begriff, dass der Satz aus einem Traum stammen müsse.Ich stellte mir auch vor, Emme müsse ein Tropeninstitut anrufen und fragen, wie man sich da verhalten müsse. Der Satz von der Hornisse, mit dem ich aufgewacht war, bezog sich auf eine auf der Stirn sitzende Hornisse. (110 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3585 (1995-03-24, 01:00 - Zürich)Ich war bei einer Tagung gewesen, an deren Ende nun die Leute alle mit Autobussen irgendwie weiter fuhren, meist nach Frankfurt, wo wohl eine weitere Tagung war. Ich war zuerst einer Spaziergesellschaft durch die Landschaft gefolgt, die auf dem Ende des Weges zum Ausgangspunkt zurückkam, wo irgendwo die Autobusse waren. Ich fragte Leute, die neben mir gingen, wie man da fahren müsse. Eine Frau, die ich angesprochen hatte, fragte einen anderen Mann, den sie Pappa nannte, der aber gerade in ein anderes Gespräch verwickelt war und deswegen nicht antwortete. Etwas wiederstrebend fragte sie auf dem Weg in eine Gartenwirtschaft, wo die Leute sich an Tische setzten, noch weitere Leute, die alle etwas vage sagten, man müsse zunächst nach Göttingen fahren und dort übernachten. Der Bus führe aber nicht hier, sondern am anderen Ufer. Es war das andere Ufer eines kleineren Gewässers, das dem Pfaffenteich in Schwerin glich. Dann sagte aber eine Frau, die auch gefragt wurde, spontan: "Clement". Das bezeichnete offenbar einen Autobus, vielleicht die Firma. Sie sprach den Namen französisch aus. Die Frau, die für mich gefragt hatte, antwortete: "Aber alle haben doch gesagt, der Weg sei weniger hübsch als der andere". Ich war totmüde, so dass mir das egal war, weil ich sowieso im Autobus schlafen würde. Ich überlegte, ob dieser Bus namens Clement vielleicht direkt zum Ziel führen würde, war auch besorgt, ob ich in dem anderen Bus dann überhaupt in Göttingen aufwachen würde, und erwachnte. Ich dachte dann während des Erwachens noch darüber nach, ob es nicht auch schön wäre, einen Tag in Göttingen zu bleiben und die alten Stätten wieder aufzusuchen. (266 words)

Ich bekam kleine bunte Zettelchen, auf denen man Notizen machen konnte, oder auch Nachrichten senden, denn man konnte sie ankleben. Ich klebte eins an eine Plastik oder Büromaschine oder das Telephon auf dem Schreibtisch. Der Mann, der der Chef war, ähnelte dem Buchhändler Thomas Bader in Freiburg. Es war auch eine Maschine zur Behandlung von Patienten in der Praxis, die elektrisch angetrieben wurde und sich sehr schnell bewegte. Wenn man sie aber abstellte, klemmte sie im Stillstand den Patienten irgendwie ein. Man musste also den Strom wieder einschalten, um ihn aus dieser misslichen Lage zu befreien. (111 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3588 (1995-03-27, 05:45 - Zürich)Ich hatte in einer Bahnstation einen Safe, wo ich meine Wertsachen hineintun konnte. In einer anderen Szene hatten wir in einem Küchenschrank eine Schublade, in der unsere Urkunden waren. Dort war eine andere kleine Schublade voller Briefmarken. Es waren aber so viele, dass die Schublade überquoll. Eine Briefmarke war an der Seite auf die hölzerne Führungsschiene der kleinen Schublade gefallen. Ich sah es, als ich die Schublade, um sie zu ordnen, ganz heraus gezogen hatte. Da die Zeit knapp war, dachte ich,"Ach lass es", und wollte schon die Schublade wieder hineinschieben. Dann aber meldete sich mein Gewissen und ich griff noch schnell in die Tiefe, um die Marke vorher heraus zu holen und zurück zu tun. Irgendwo war auch eine schiefe Ebene, wo die Sachen, die man darauf legte, wegrollten. In einer anderen Szene war ich beim Militärdienst, hatte aber meine goldene Uhr bei mir. Ich beschloss, noch schnell zu dem Safe zu laufen, um sie dort unterzubringen, und erwachte. Im Erwachen überlegte ich noch, dass ich aber dann statt der Uhr den Safeschlüssel bei mir haben würde und hüten müsse. (181 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3589 (1995-03-28, 03:45 - Zürich)Ich ging durch von Schlägern und Verbrechern beherrschte Altstadtgassen. Ich war in eine Gegend geraten, wo man sonst nachts nicht hingeht, weil es gefährlich ist. In einer schmalen Seitengasse lag ein Mann auf dem Boden, um den andere herumstanden. Man wusste nicht, ob er tot war, oder verletzt, oder süchtig. Ich konnte nicht umkehren, weil hinter mir die Verbrecher waren, aber vor mir wurde die Gegend immer gefährlicher. Ich überlegte, ob ich durch die nächste schmale Seitengasse versuchen sollte, aus dieser gefährlichen Gegend auszubrechen. Aber es konnten auch dort unheimliche Elemente sein. Andere Szenen waren vorhergegangen, die mir erst jetzt wieder einfallen. Ich war mit meinem Bruder in Schwerin oder einer ähnlichen Gegend in der Wohnung des Elternhauses. Er hatte Besuch von einem Juristen bekommen, den er wohl von der Kindheit her kannte. Mit diesem sollte ich spazieren gehen, durch die Cäcilienallee in Richtung zum Greenhouse. Aber dort war die Strasse gefährlich. Der Jurist, den ich begleitete, entpuppte sich als Verbrecher. Ich versuchte, ihm Handschellen anzulegen. Wir waren jetzt schon in der gefährlichen Altstadt, die in der folgenden Szene die Topographie bildete und die mehr der Zürcher Altstadt im Niederdorf mit den kleinen zur Limmat führenden Seitengassen glich. Aber in dieser Szene waren wir dabei in eine Art Zunfthaus geraten. Dort war es, wo ich dem Mann Handschellen angelegt hatte. Ich floh nun mit Emme aus dem Eingang des Zunfthauses in die Altstadtgassen, fürchtete aber, dass der Mann hinter uns herkommen könne. Dann wandelte sich der Traum in die Szene, die ich am Anfang beschrieben habe und aus der ich dann aufwachte. (262 words)

Ich ziehe mich mühsam aussen hoch, sehe dann aber, dass ich unmöglich in diesen schmalen Spalt hineinkommen kann, und lasse mich wieder herunter. Das Auto fährt weg. Dann hält ein zweiter, wohl noch schwerer Lastwagen an, dessen Führerkabine ebenso vollgestopft von Menschen ist. Auch hier bleibt nur ein ganz schmaler Spalt im Liegeteil der Kabine frei. Ich ziehe mich wieder mühsam hoch, sehe wieder, dass ich nicht in den schmalen Spalt hineinkommen kann, überlege noch, ob ich mit dem Kopf oder mit den Füssen zuerst hineinkriechen müsste, und bekomme Angstvorstellungen dabei, lasse mich wieder herab und erwache mit sehr starkem Herzklopfen, das zwar nicht schnell aber unheimlich stark und regelmässig ist.

Ich fragte sie, wo es weh täte. Sie sprach nur gebrochen deutsch und zeigte unter Tränen an die Leistengegend und an den Fuss. Bei uns war ein Arzt, der dem Doktor Rennemann glich und sofort den Namen einer Diagnose nannte. Sie fragte, wo man es billig behandeln lassen könnte, und er sagte, kommen Sie sofort in die Praxis, er nannte hier den Namen der Praxis, der irgendwie poetisch klang, etwa wie "Regen und Sonnenschein" und sagte, dass es dort gerade eine "Aktion" gäbe, das heisst eine verbilligte Behandlung. Ich sah, dass die Frau kaum noch gehen konnte, und erwachte mit der Überlegung, ob ich sie Huckepack tragen sollte. Erwachen mit Kopfschmerzen, die erneut begonnen hatten, obwohl ich in der Nacht schon eine Tablette dagegen geschluckt hatte. (149 words)

Emme, die der Technik offenbar mehr traute, fand das aber ganz ungefährlich. In der Kirche, in der viele Leute waren, sollte gerade ein Gottesdienst stattfinden und sie schwankte auf dem antennenartigen Turm sehr, als ich sie mit Hilfe irgend einer technischen Einrichtung in die Höhe schraubte.

So zuckte auch der Mann, als sie das sagte, zusammen, was sie aber nicht merkte, weil sie ja draussen im Flur war. Um sie zu warnen, sagte ich ineiner Geheimsprasche: "Emme, red keinen Quatsch".

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3598 (1995-04-04, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich war in einem Kurs und musste eine Schrift von Goethe behandeln, die den Titel hatte "Die zwei Hefte", womit zwei Machtbereiche gemeint waren oder Reiche, nämlich das Reich des Traums und das Reich des Wachens. Das Wort Heft also in dem Sinne wie in dem Satz "Er hat fest das Heft in der Hand". Zuerst hörte ich den Text gesprochen wie im Radio, ohne zu wissen, dass er von Goethe sei. Ich fand vieles treffend, manches nicht ganz richtig, weil es dem Traum Eigenheiten zuschrieb, die ihm nur vom Wachen her gesehen zukommen. Dann aber breitete sich in dem Gesprochenen ganz der Zauber der Traumwelt aus und ich war entzückt. Hinterher, als ich nun die Aufgabe hatte, diesen Text von Goethe zu behandeln, war es wie bei der Herstellung eines Artikels, und ich überlegte die Form der Darstellung meines Textes. Es war irgendwie noch eine andere Szene da, wo ein Kollege, der teils Gerhard Schmidtchen, teils Walter Bernet glich, das Bild einer Landschaft zeigte - Es stand wie eine Projektion in der Luft- Und er fragte: "Erinnerst Du Dich?". Ich schaute mich um, um zu sehen, wen er meinte, bis ich begriff, dass er mich meinte, und erkannte, dass es der Anblick einer Landschaft war, die wir vor uns gehabt hatten, als wir zusammen auf einer Bank, wohl bei einem Waldrand, gesessen hatten, in diese Landschaft geschaut und dabei ein Konzept entwicklet hatten, das wohl das Konzept dieser beiden Reiche, der beiden Hefte also, war. Er hatte beim Kellner, jetzt auf der gegenwärtigen Versammlung, eine Bank bestellt, die der, auf der wir damals sassen, glich. Ich hatte auch da nicht begriffen, dass er diese Bank für sich und mich haben wollte, damit wir das Konzept von damals, darauf sitzend, wieder beleben konnten. (293 words)

Ich war etwas betroffen über diese merkwürdige Anzeige, die so gar nicht zu meinem Stil passte, und stellte mir vor, wie es wäre, wenn alle Leser der Zeitung mit einer Millionenauflage kommen würden. Das sagte ich auch zu jemanden. Ich war in der Zeitung mit vollem Namen genannt. (86 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3602 (1995-04-08, 05:30 - Zürich)Ein grosser Vogel mit gewaltigen ausgebreiteten Schwingen kam mir in der Luft auf einem Wagen entgegen. Es war Ädlerchen auf seiner Reise, von der ich vorher geträumt hatte. Jetzt geschah sie im Wachen. Wir selber, Emme und ich, waren in einem Autobus, der sehr schnell auf einer zweispurigen Strasse fuhr. Ein Lastauto überholte uns auf der rechten Spur, was mich verwirrte. Der Bus näherte sich immer sehr schnell vor ihm befindlichen Hindernissen, so zum Beispiel einem sehr langsam fahrenden Pferdewagen auf dieser Autostrasse. Ich dachte: Wir sitzen ja ganz hinten, so dass uns bei einem Zusammenstoss vielleicht nicht viel passieren wird. Er konnte aber immer noch rechtzeitig bremsen. Dann wachte ich auf und schrieb im Bett liegend diesen Traum auf einem Blatt Papier mit Bleistift im Dunklen auf. Die Uhr zeigte erst halb vier Uhr morgens. Emme war aufgewacht und begann zu reden von Spaziergangsplänen am Morgen. Ich sagte, sie solle noch einen Augenblick ruhig sein, bis ich den Traum fertig aufgeschrieben hätte. Ich wollte noch einmal richtig nach der Uhr sehen, die neben meinem Bett stand, und drückte auf den Knopf, der dazu führt, dass das Zifferblatt erleuchtet wird. Ich dachte dabei noch, dass wir doch auf Reisen sehr gut eingerichtet sind, dass man so etwas machen kann. Aber die Beleuchtung funktionierte nicht richtig und erleuchtete das Zifferblatt nur ganz schwach, so dass ich die Zeit nicht richtig ablesen konnte. Ich überlegte, dass das wohl daran liegen könnte, dass die Batterie erschöpft war, und dass dann auch die Uhrzeit vielleicht nicht mehr richtig angezeigt würde. Darum blickte ich auf eine andere Uhr, die ebenfalls auf dem Regal neben meinem Bett stand, und merkte nun, dass es in Wirklichkeit schon halb acht Uhr morgens war, was auch erklärte, dass Emme schon von den Spaziergangsplänen gesprochen hatte. Dann wachte ich auf und mir wurde allmählich klar, dass ich noch garnichts von dem Traum augfgeschrieben, sondern dieses Aufschreiben nur geträumt hatte. (319 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3603 (1995-04-09, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich hatte eine Sammlung von lebensgrossen alten englischen Autobussen. Einer war ganz flachgedrückt und stand wie ein riesengrosses Bild an eine Wand gelehnt. Er war gelb und sehr dekorativ. Ich überlegte, wie ich ihn wieder ins dreidimensionale auseinanderziehen könne. Aber dazu brauchte es natürlich riesenhafte Kräfte. Vielleicht konnte man ganz vorsichtig mit ihm gegen eine Wand fahren und hoffen, dass er dabei wie ein zusammengefalteter Karton durch den Druck wieder seine dreidimensionale Form annehmen würde. Jemand gab mir den Rat, erst einmal mit ihm ums Karee zu fahren. Aber wie sollte ich hineinkommen, und würde der Motor überhaupt noch funktionieren? Es fällt mir ein, dass in einer vorhergehenden Szene ein grosses, vom Regen verwelltes, sehr schönes altes Buch eine Rolle gespielt hatte, wo auch die Frage war, wie man es wieder glatt kriegen würde. Dann als Fortsetzung der Geschichte mit dem Autobus andere Szene: Ich ging jetzt über einen riesenhaften, aus einer Art Sandfläche, die gewellt und irgendwie wüst war, bestehenden Platz in einer Stadt. Ein Autobus kam hinter mir her und wollte offenbar immer gerade dorthin fahren, wo ich ging, so dass ich immer ausweichen musste. Offenbar hatte er irgendwo auf dem Platz eine Haltestelle. Aber dieser Platz war so aufgelöst, dass man etwas wie eine Haltestelle nicht mehr erkennen konnte. Ich ging schneller, um von dem Platz wieder auf eine normale Strasse zu kommen. Vor mir türmten sich aber jetzt Sandhügel wie eine Art grauer Wanderdünen auf, die aber fest geworden waren. Es war als ob der Platz sich gewellt oder verformt hätte. Ich wollte erst rechts an ihnen vorbei gehen, sah aber, dass ich dann ganz von der Strasse abgekommen wäre, die ich erreichen wollte, und musste darum eine scharfe Wendung nach links machen, um um den Hügel herum zu kommen. Ich überlegte, ob ich nicht mit dem Autobus fahren könne, falls er anhalten würde, und so schneller mein Ziel erreichen würde. Dann bin ich aufgewacht und brauchte eine Zeit, bis ich begriff, dass das ein Traum gewesen war. (332 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3604 (1995-04-10, 01:15 - Zürich)Ich hatte ein paar alte, sehr schmale und spitz zulaufende knöchelhohe Schuhe, die mir nicht mehr passten. Ich selbst oder jemand anders kam auf die Idee, dass sie R. passen könnten, der gerade eingezogen war. Ich trug sie darum runter auf sein Schuhbord, ein Regal, wo für verschiedene Leute Platz für ihre Schuhe war. Als ich sie dorthin gestellt hatte, kam mir in den Sinn, dass ich irgend etwas machen müsse, damit er überhaupt merke, dass sie für ihn seien. So nahm ich einen Zettel, den ich dort liegen sah, und schrieb mit Bleistift hinauf "Viele Grüsse, Detlev". Ich mochte nicht "Dein Detlev" schreiben, da er mir ja feindlich gesonnen ist. Dann hörte ich im Hinausgehen aus dem Kellerraum seine Stimme und sagte "Guten Morgen", um nicht stumm vorbei zu gehen. Er sagte irgend etwas, was ich nicht verstand, hatte mich aber offenbar nicht erkannt. Ich ging weiter und er wiederholte nun etwas auf Englisch und sagte "Is it the eating phenomen?". Offenbar meinte er, dass die vorbeihegende Person zum Essen ging. Ich antwortete im Fortgehen: "It is", und fügte auf Deutsch hinzu "Aber nicht zum Essen". Dann wachte ich auf und wunderte mich sehr, dass ich R., den ich doch nicht mag, weil er mir so feindlich gesonnen ist, ein paar Schuhe geschenkt habe. (215 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3605 (1995-04-10, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich musste zusammen mit einem Mädchen zum Bahnhof gehen, wo um eine bestimmte Zeit mein Zug abfuhr. Es war eine Topographie wie in Freiburg. Wir befanden uns jetzt noch in einem Haus, wohl einem Bürohaus oder Kaufhaus in der Nähe des Bertholdsbrunnens. Ich hatte einen kleinen faltbaren Regenschirm bei mir, den ich zusammenlegte und in die Hülle schob. Das war nicht sehr schön geworden und sie nahm mir den Schirm ab, um ihn schöner zusammen zu legen. Dafür zog sie ihn aber zuerst in einer Weise auseinander, die, wie ich sah, nicht zum Erfolg führen konnte. Dabei begleitete sie ihre Handlung mit einer erklärenden Rede, wie man es bei einem Verkaufsgespräch tut. Ich wurde langsam unruhig, da die Zeit bis zur Abfahrt des Zuges knapp wurde und wir doch noch ein Stück Wegs bis zum Bahnhof zurück zu legen hatten. Sie merkte selbst, dass die Zeit knapp wurde und sagte: Sie müssen doch ihren Zug erreichen. Gehen Sie doch ruhig schon los. Offenbar dachte sie, dass sie dann allein den Schirm in Ordnung bringen würde. Das hätte ja aber nichts genützt, denn ich musste den Schirm doch mitnehmen. So ergriff ich diesen einfach in seiner langgezogenen Form, die er nun hatte, fasste sie am Arm und sagte: Gehen wir doch einfach los. In diesem Moment kam aber ein alter Mann vorbei, der offenbar dachte, dass die Frau ihm etwas Böses getan hätte, und diese packte, um sie zur Polizei zu führen. Ich sagte, er solle sie los lassen, denn wir hätten keine Zeit. Aber er hielt sie eisern fest und versuchte, sie weg zu zerren. So packte ich ihn, um ihn von ihr loszureissen. Er hatte aber einen eiserenen Griff und war hartnäckig und starrsinnig. So bog ich ihm den Kopf, am Kinn schiebend, zurück, um ihn auf diese Weise zu zwingen, sie los zu lassen. Er war aber eisern und wild entschlossen wie jemand, der sich in seinem Recht verletzt fühlt. Offenbar war er irre. Ich drückte nun weiter gegen sein Kinn, um ihn zum Loslassen zu zwingen, und überlegte dabei, dass ich dies nicht zu heftig und ruckartig tun dürfe, damit ihm nichts passiere, da er auch schon sehr alt und gebrechlich schien. In dieser Situation wachte ich auf und beschloss zuerst, den Traum nicht aufzuschreiben, weil er zu albern sei. (383 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3606 (1995-04-11, 02:00 - Zürich)Wir waren in einem vornehmen Hotel. Dort wurde morgens das Frühstück an einer gemeinsamen Tafel eingenommen. Dafür wurde man rechtzeitig vorher geweckt. Die weckende Frau war sehr gesprächig und wollte ihre Gäste unterhalten. Ab und zu sagte sie während ihrer Rede Gedichte auf, wobei sie in der Tür stand. Emme, die alle die Gedichte kannte, sprach die Verse mit, so dass es wie ein Echo klang, was die Frau etwas verwirrte, da sie von ihrem Standort aus Emme nicht sehen konnte und nicht wusste, wo das Echo herkam. Wegen dieser echoartigen Wirkung konnte man aber den Inhalt der Gedichte nicht richtig verstehen. Vorher war eine andere Szene gewesen. Ich musste in einem grossen Saal einen Vortrag halten in einem Gebäude, das sonst politischen internationalen Verhandlungem diente, wie bei der Uno. Hier waren sehr wichtige Verträge geschlossen worden, die Afrika betrafen, wo das Gebäude wohl auch war. Ganz kurz, bevor der Vortrag begann, kamen der Teno und seine Frau, also das Kaiserpaar von Japan, herein und nahmen in einer Art Fürstenloge oder an einem ausgezeichneten Ort ganz vorne Platz. Ich begann mit den üblichen Worten "Meine Damen und Herren" und dachte hinterher, dass ich wohl mit der Anrede "Kaiserliche Hoheiten" hätte beginnen müssen. Andere begannen ihre Vorträge mit Anspielungen auf die politischen Ereignisse, die hier in diesem Saal stattgefunden hatten, während ich einfach direkt mit der Sache begann. Auch alle hiesigen Psychologieprofessoren waren bei den Zuhörern. In dieser Hinsicht war es mehr wie in der Aula der hiesigen Universität. Noch vorher war eine Szene gewesen, wo wir durch ein Treppenhaus schreitend den Weg zu dem Vortragssaal gesucht hatten. (267 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3607 (1995-04-12, 01:45 - Zürich)Ich liess von etwa zwölf Abbildungen aus einem Buch beim Photographen Photos machen, die ich als Vorlagen für Bilder in einem Artikel brauchte. Ich hätte wohl die Geräte gehabt, um das selber zu machen, aber gar keine Übung und jetzt nicht die Zeit, um das erst noch zu lernen. Deshalb sagte ich zu dem Photographen, nachdem er die Aufnahmen gemacht hatte und ich daneben gestanden hatte, wie froh ich sei, dass er es gemacht habe, da es für mich sehr mühsam geworden wäre. Ich wusste, dass die Rechnung relativ hoch sein würde. In dem selben Geschäft war auch noch eine Galerie, in der es kostbare Gläser oder Ähnliches gab, und ich wollte diese noch ansehen, ehe ich ging. Ich weiss nicht mehr, was die Bilder abbildeten. Habe irgendwie das Gefühl, es wären Wolken oder ähnliches gewesen. (136 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3608 (1995-04-12, 05:45 - Zürich)Gisela ruft an. Ich erkenne sie an der Stimme, aber es ist eine ganz starke Störung in der Leitung und ein ganz starkes Rauschen. Deshalb kann man sie nicht verstehen. Ich sage, sie soll ganz langsam und deutlich sprechen. Das gelingt ihr aber nur teilweise. Sie ist irgendwo in Ferien und will wissen, ob ich zu ihrem geplanten Treffen mit alten Freunden komme. Wenn nicht, sagt sie, will sie es jetzt entscheiden, "und zwar im negativen Sinne", wie sie es ausdrückt. Offenbar haben die meisten Leute abgesagt, vielleicht, weil es mit Zelten verbunden sein sollte, überlege ich, und doch alle Leute ihres Alters jetzt um siebzig sind. Ich wiederhole, was ich gehört habe, um zu sehen, ob ich richtig gehört habe, weil die Leitung immer noch sehr gestört ist. Sie antwortet Ja und ich sage, dass ich jetzt leider nicht kommen kann, weil ich den Vortrag in Lindau habe mit über tausend Zuhörern, was natürlich viel Vorbereitung erfordert, und dann gleich das Semester mit den Vorlesungen beginnt. Dann bin ich aufgewacht und es wird mir klar, dass ich seit langen zum ersten mal wieder direkt von Gisela geträumt habe, während sie sonst eher im Kontext vorkommt. (196 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3609 (1995-04-13, 06:00 - Zürich)Wir waren in England bei einer Familie, die aus einem grossen Schloss wie Blenheim Palace stammte. Das junge Paar hatte einen Wettbewerb gewonnen, in dem es kleine silberne Modelle der Schlösser der Familie machte, die aber eigentlich kleine Plastiken in einem modernen Stil waren, der irgendwo an Henry Moore erinnerte. Sie schütteten die kleinen Modelle aus einem aus Holz geschnitzten Rohr auf den Tisch des Mannes, der die Arbeiten für den Wettbewerb entgegen nahm. In diesem Moment wusste man noch nicht, dass sie damit die späteren Gewinner des Wettkampfes sein würden. Es war wie die Einreichung der Modelle eines Architekturwettbewerbs. Wir hatten bei uns auch ein grosses tischartiges Modell eines solchen Schlosses, das bei dem Gewinn eine Rolle gespielt hatte. Ein anderes Mitglied der Familie, eine junge Frau, war entsetzt von der dunklen Grösse des Schlosses. Man merkte, dass sie garnicht wusste, aus einem wie berühmten Schloss sie und ihre Familie stammte. Ich wollte zu ihr sagen, dass auch mir das Schloss zuerst unheimlich und drohend erschienen sei, man sich aber sehr daran gewöhne und es einem dann lieb und vertraut sei. Ehe ich dies ausgesprochen hatte, erwachnte ich. (189 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3610 (1995-04-14, 04:00 - Zürich)Ich war in einem Haus, in dem ein Teil der Fenster als Kippfenster neu eingerichtet waren, wobei die Achse der Drehung genau in halber Höhe des Fensters lag. Auf diese Weise entstand an bestimmten Stellen des Zimmers ein scharfer Zug, so auch in dem Raum, in dem wir waren, wo er genau die Betten traf, in denen nachts die Familie schlief. Ich monierte das, und der Mann, mit dem ich sprach, stimmte mir zu, meinte aber, man solle einfach statt dieser andere Fenster in dem Raum öffnen, die nicht diese neue Einrichtung hatten und durch die es deshalb nicht zog.

Dann andere Szene: Ich fuhr mit Emme in einem Auto oder Motorrad durch eine Strasse, von der wir links in eine sehr breite Strasse einbiegen mussten. Emme hielt das Steuer so, dass wir äusserst links fuhren, weil ihr die breite Strasse unheimlich war, schaute dabei aber gleichzeitig nach hinten, um zu sehen, ob von dort jemand käme, so dass wir in Gefahr waren, an die linke Leitplanke zu kommen. Ich griff darum ins Steuer, um dies zu verhindern. Ich war im Begriff, zu sagen, "Du bist auf der Überholspur", als ich erwachte. (117 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3612 (1995-04-16, 04:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte einen Computer, der auch Material testete, aber wohl eigentlich Papier. Emme hatte ein Stück einer Muschel hineingetan, um es untersuchen zu lassen. Der Computer begann zu rauchen und ein malmendes Geräusch zu machen, als wenn er die Muschel zermahlt. Gleichzeitig leuchteten abwechselnd in schnellem Rhythmus viele rote Lampen auf. ich zog den Stecker so schnell wie möglich aus der Steckdose, damit er nicht kaputt gehe, aber es stieg weiter Rauch aus ihm auf und die Lampen leuchteten weiter auf und ich erwachte mit Halsschmerzen und Temperatur, die ich in dem rauchenden Computer, dem malmenden Geräusch und den aufglühenden Lampen wiedererkannte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3613 (1995-04-16, 07:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte an einen Computer in der Uni gearbeitet und dabei sehr viele Seiten eines Textes durchgelassen. Schliesslich erschien eine Schrift auf einem Leuchtschild an der Wand: "Bei soviel Bedarf in einem kleinen Fachbereich erst prüfen, ob..." Der Rest des Satzes war nicht lesbar sondern ein Buchstabengewirr. Auch im lesbaren Teil des Satzes waren viele Fehler. Irgendwo stand noch "nicht trennen", was wohl bedeutete,. dass man jetzt nicht den Stecker rausziehen sollte. Ich hoffte, dass die Schrift verschwinden werde, ehe meine Kollegen es sahen, vor allem auch, weil sie sich sicher über die Bezeichnung "Kleiner Fachbereich" ärgern würden. Dann bin ich aufgewacht.

Ich wurde dadurch irritiert, so dass ich dachte, ich müsse das kopierte Blatt nur wieder neu kopieren und mir erst dann wieder einfiel, dass ich es ja noch auseinanderschneiden und neu zusammensetzten müsse. Es bestand nun die Gefahr, dass ich die einzelnen herausgeschnittenen Stücke verwechselte und in den Kolonnen falsch zusammensetzen würde. (94 words)

Alle Leute waren empört, denn man hätte dann nachts sich immer erst anziehen müssen, um durch die Kälte hinauszugehen. Es wurden deshalb Unterschriften für eine Volksinitiative dagegen gesammelt. Es war im Traum einerseits in Japan, andererseits aber zugleich auch hier, und die Leute, die im Traum vorkamen, waren Europäer. Hinter dem Gesetz stand eine Art Idealismus, einerseits ein Badekult, dem ein eigenes Badehaus dienen sollte, andererseits aber wohl auch das Bedürfnis, die Klosphäre vom Wohnbereich zu trennen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3618 (1995-04-21, 05:20 - Zürich)Ich wollte Urs Imoberdorf die Zusammenstellung der Bildvorlagen für den neuen Artikel in der ZfM zeigen. Es war aber nirgends genügend Platz, um die Blätter auszubreiten, weil alle Tische vollgelegt waren. So breiteten wir sie schliesslich auf dem Bett aus. Dann andere Szene: Die Bildvorlagen waren inzwischen fortgeschickt oder fortgebracht. Die Frau des neuen Schriftleiters hatte angerufen und gefragt, ob man das Ganze nun an den Verlag weiterschicken könne, und ich hatte dies bejaht. Jetzt kamen aber plötzlich lauter Bildvorlagen zu anderen Artikeln bei uns zum Vorschein, die der neue Schriftleiter zusammengestellt hatte. Offenbar waren also garnicht die Originale fortgebracht worden, und ich sagte, man müsse sofort wieder die Frau anrufen, mit der ich gesprochen hatte. Urs Imoberdorf meinte dagegen, dass das garnicht so eilig sei. Die Bildvorlagen, die wir jetzt sahen, wirkten etwas esoterisch oder anthroposophisch, etwa wie die Bilder in den Veleda-Heften. Einige waren auch zusammengefaltete grosse Gebilde, die eigentlich garnicht in das Format der Zeitschrift passten. Meinen eigenen Artikel betraf das aber nicht. (166 words)

Dann aber, als wir uns dem Ziel der Fahrt näherten, wurde ihr Verhalten auffällig, als wenn sie einen Kontrolleur fürchtete. Sie ging bei der letzten Haltestelle an die Tür, als wenn sie aussteigen wolle, tat es aber nicht. Dann kam mir die Idee, dass sie vielleicht Rauschgift bei sich haben könne und Entdeckung fürchtete. Als ich das gerade gedacht hatte, wandte sie sich an mich mit den Worten "Du Detlev" und wollte mir ihr Tenniszeug unter irgend einem Vorwand geben. Ich überlegte, dass darin das Rauschgift sein könne, überlegte, wie ich die Bitte abschlagen könne, und erwachte. (127 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3624 (1995-04-26, 05:15 - Zürich)Ich war beim TÜV und machte verkehrspsychologische Untersuchungen. Als nächstes sollte eine junge Probandin kommen, über die ich schon einmal ein negatives Gutachten geschrieben hatte. Ich stellte fest, dass die Akte der damaligen Untersuchungen nicht bei meinen Unterlagen war und noch gesucht werden musste. Sie hatte, glaube ich, die Nummer 181 oder eine ähnliche Nummer. Ich überlegte, dass ich der Sekretärin sagen müsse, sie solle sie gleich suchen, denn für mich selber war die Zeit knapp, da ich noch mit einem anderen Probanden beschäftigt war. Es waren irgendwelche Probleme mit der Probandin verbunden, die dann kommen würde, und die Entscheidung, die ich würde fällen müssen, stand mir bevor. Aber sie konnte sich ja inzwischen positiv verändert haben, da sie noch im Entwicklungsalter war. Inzwischen kamen irgendwelche Nachrichten, wohl im Radio oder Fernsehen, von einem Mann, der die Leute in Atem hielt, indem er immer da, wo Ballett aufgeführt wurde, irgendwelche Anschläge machte. Sie schienen aber in gewisser Weise auch harmlos zu sein. Gleichzeitig hatte er einen Weg gefunden, an vielen Orten Alarmglocken läuten zu lassen, die man nicht abstellen konnte. Auch jetzt hörte ich wieder solche. Es war ihm gelungen, so in die Technik dieser Alarmglockensysteme einzudringen, dass sie alle gleichzeitig zu läuten begannen und es nicht möglich war, sie zum Schweigen zu bringen. Diese Dinge vermischten sich irgendwie mit den Problemen der zu untersuchenden Probandin. Ich sprach auch mit der Sekratärin über diesen Mann und sagte, dass er mir eigentlich garnicht so gefährlich zu sein schiene, wie er nach den Nachrichten und wegen der allgemeinen Aufregung, die er schuf, zu sein schien. Sie antwortete, irgendwie missverstehend, dass es für ihn sicher am besten wäre, wenn er tot sei, worüber ich mich wunderte, weil es mir ganz inadäquat schien. Man sah daraus aber, dass sie ihn offenbar für sehr gefährlich hielt. Gleichzeitig machte ich mir wieder Sorgen über die zu untersuchende Probandin und die zu fällende Entscheidung. Dabei erwachte ich und erlebte nach einer Weile das, was Freud die Wunscherfüllung im Erwachen nennt, nämlich, dass ich froh war, solche Entscheidungen ja schon seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr fällen zu müssen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3625 (1995-04-27, 02:30 - Zürich)Ich stand an einem tiefen Wassergraben, mit steilen steinernen Wänden, über den verschiedene Leute, die an der anderen Seite standen, hinweg mussten. Einigen gelang es, hinüber zu springen, indem sie einen Anlauf nahmen, einer aber fiel hinein, konnte aber an den steinernen Wänden Halt finden, indem er rechtzeitig die Beine spreitzte. Es war aber unmöglich, an der steilen Wand hoch zu kommen. So überlegte er, ob er sich einfach ganz ins Wasser fallen lasen sollte, von dem man aber nicht wusste, wie tief es war, und wie es dann weiter gehen sollte. Während er noch darüber sprach, wachte ich auf. (100 words)

Wir spielten damit wie Kinder und waren ganz entzückt. (64 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3627 (1995-04-28, 23:30 - Zürich)Ich sollte eine Vorlesung im Schweriner Dom halten. Das Katheder stand aber so weit hinten im Chor, dass ich ganz weit von den Bänken entfernt war, in denen die Leute sassen. Es war auch offenbar falsch herum aufgestellt und musste von den Technikern, die noch damit beschäftigt waren, erst umgedreht werden. Emme kam herbei und sagte, dass auch die Beleuchtung nicht richtig sei, und auch diese wurde in Ordnung gebracht. Ich überlegte mir nun, dass es wohl ein Mikrophon geben müsse, da die Grösse des Raums wohl ein Sprechen ohne ein solches schwierig machen würde. Es fiel mir dann ein, dass es vielleicht besser gewesen wäre, von der Kanzel aus zu sprechen, wo der Sichtkontakt besser gewesen wäre. Dann kam mir in Erinnerung, dass die Akustik bei den Predigten, die ich als Kind von dieser Kanzel gehört hatte, immer sehr hallend gewesen war und mit einem so starken Echo, dass der Pastor ganz getragen und langsam sprechen musste. Ich machte mir Sorgen, ob es mit der Akustik überhaupt funktionieren würde, und erwachte. Danach setzte sich diese Überlegung noch eine Weile fort, bis ich ganz begriffen hatte, dass es ja ein Traum war und ich dieses Problem also garnicht wirklich lösen musste. (201 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3628 (1995-04-30, 22:50 - Zürich)Wir waren mit Tina im Theater, wo es um die Vorbereitung der Aufführung eines Stückes von Goethe ging, in dem die Rezitation eines Textes von Musik durch ein Orchester begleitet wurde. Ich sagte zu Tina, nachdem ich eine Weile der Vorbereitung und Probe zugesehen und zugehört hatte, dass hier sicher alles darauf ankommen würde, ob der Sprecher oder die Sprecherin, es war, glaube ich, eine Schauspielerin, in der Lage sein würde, sich richtig in die Musik einzupassen und umgekehrt, die Musik richtig dem Sprechen angepasst sein würde. Tina antwortete etwas ironisch: "Weisst Du einen Engel?", womit sie meinte, eine Schauspielerin, die in der Lage sein würde, das Rezitierte so engelhaft gut der Musik anzupassen. Tina hatte zuerst nicht richtig gehört, was ich sagte, weil sie durch irgendetwas abgelenkt war. (129 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3629 (1995-04-30, 04:00 - Zürich)Ich war in England zur Zeit der Pfirsichblüte. die mit wunderbarem Rosa das ganze Land überzog. Zugleich hatte es noch einmal geschneit und dickes Weiss bedeckte diese Blütenpracht und man sah die schneebedeckten Gipfel der Berge um sich, die so hoch waren wie hier die Alpen. Ich filmte das Ganze und hatte dazu eine neue Filmkamera, deren Art und Weise ich dabei ausprobierte. Dann war es Morgen nach einer Nacht, in der ich geschlafen hatte. Ich wollte den Film fortsetzen und mein weisses Bettlaken filmen, das ich als Überschlaglaken unter der Wolldecke benützte, und dazu etwas Poetisches über die weisse Farbe sagen, das den Film dann beschliessen sollte. Aber ich konnte plötzlich nichts durch das Okular der Kamera sehen, obwohl sie lief. Ich zog die Schutzhülle ab und jetzt ging es wieder. Offenbar hatte die Hülle sich verschoben und das Okular bedeckt. Emme war gerade hereingekommen und man würde das, was sie sagte, auf dem Tonfilm ebenfalls hören. Dann wachte ich auf. (162 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3630 (1995-05-01, 05:45 - Zürich)Wir wollten irgendwo hin gehen und ich hatte schon den Tweedmantel angezogen. Da sagte Emme, ich solle stattdessen den Dufflecoat anziehen, da der Tweedmantel zur Reinigung sollte. Also zog ich ihn wieder aus, rollte ihn ein, steckte ihn in einen Plastikbeutel, zog stattdessen den Dufflecoat über und nahm den Tweedmantel in dem Beutel mit. Unterwegs kam mir aber in den Sinn, dass der Tweedmantel noch in einem sehr guten Zustand war und durch die Reinigung vielleicht an Festigkeit verlieren werde. Ich sagte deshalb, dass wir ihn lieber nicht zur Reinigung bringen sollten und nahm in Kauf, dass ich ihn dann unterwegs in dem Plastikbeutel mit mir tragen müsse. (108 words)

Ich spielte dort etwas, das ich im Moment des Spielens erfand. Es war eine getragene sehr nachdenkliche Melodie und ohne Bravoureffekte. Dann andere Szene. Ich hatte irgendwo einen sehr grossen Lautsprecher, der eigentlich die Grösse eines Schranks hatte, und den ich mit nach Hause nahm. Ich hatte aber Zweifel, ob ich ihn dort unterbringen können würde. Man konnte diesen Schrank auch flachlegen und die Lautsprecher so daraus hervorziehen, dass sie wie ein Tisch waren. In einer anderen Szene hatten wir irgendwo eine grosse Stiftung gemacht und die Frau, die die Institution verwaltete, schenkte uns schön geformte Osterhasen aus verschiedenfarbiger Schokolade, über die ich mich sehr freute. Ich bekam vor allem helle, weisse oder beige Hasen, die in der Form kleine Kunstwerke waren. (166 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3635 (1995-05-05, 05:45 - Zürich)Wir lebten in einem alten kasernenartigen Haus. Unsere Betten standen in einem Raum, in dessen Mittelpunkt eine steinerne labyrinthartige Struktur war, durch deren Gänge man gehen musste, um zu den Betten zu gelangen. Dann kam ein Mann, der alles in Ordnung bringen wollte. Als wir wieder in das Zimmer kamen, waren unsere Betten weg. Er hatte sie in einen anderen ordentlicheren Raum bringen lassen. Aber wir schätzten die vertraute Umgebung des alten Raums mit dem Labyrinth. Wir mussten befürchten, dass er auch unsere kleinen persönlichen Sachen, die sich gesammelt hatten, weggeräumt hatte. Irgendwo fand ich einen Beutel mit kleinen hölzernen Spielzeugtieren, die ihm entgangen waren, und beschloss, diese an mich zu nehmen. Dann eine Art Heimreise. Es war nicht eine militärische Gruppe, der wir angehörten, sondern eher eine Ansammlung von Leuten, die sich im Laufe der Zeit durch Zufall gebildet hatte. Ich setzte mich auf eine Art Kutschbock eines Fahrzeugs, das aber wohl eher eine alte Eisenbahn war, und war nicht sicher, ob es während der Fahrt nicht recht kühl werden könnte, hatte aber wohl genug wollene Kleidungsstücke bei mir. Die Labyrinthstruktur war das eigentlich Erstaunliche in dem Traum . Es waren bis zur Decke hochgezogene Mauern, durch deren Gänge man in rechten Winkeln gehen konnte. Es war auch eine Toilette an die alten Räume angebaut, die der Neuorganisator aber für die Öffentlichkeit geöffnet hatte, indem er eine kleine Tür von aussen aufgemacht hatte, so dass sie so voller Leute war und dass es in ihr ungemütlich war und ich wieder hinausging.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3636 (1995-05-06, 00:30 - Zürich)Eine Gruppe von vorwiegend jungen Leuten verschiedener Nationen und Konfessionen, die miteinander über Krieg und Frieden und ähnliche allgemeine Fragen diskutieren. Man spürt, wie dabei immer, wenn Fragen berührt werden, die Nationales anrühren, eine gewisse Unruhe und Erregung ausbricht, und wie sehr eigentlich die Einigung in der Diskussion auch darauf beruht, dass solche Erregung ausgeblendet wird. Als ich gerade dazu komme, das sagen zu wollen, sagt jemand, dass wir uns jetzt die Frage stellen müssen, was wir eigentlich überhaupt tun, wenn wir solche Gespräche miteinander führen. Während ich überlege, wie ich diesen eben in mir entstandenen Gedanken am besten ausdrücken soll, erwache ich langsam. Die Gruppe ist eigentlich von einem starken Einigungswillen und der Absicht gegenseitigen Verständnisses beherrscht und trotzdem immer am Rande des Ausbrechens dieser Erregung, wenn bei jedem einzelnen nationale Fragen und Gefühle berührt werden. Mir kommt im Erwachen noch in den Sinn, dass sie zur Einigung ein gemeinsames Pathos, eine übergeordnete Grösse, wie zum Beispiel Europa oder Ähnliches brauchen. (162 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3637 (1995-05-06, 06:15 - Zürich)Ich bin mit einem Kollegen bei einem Kongress, zu dem wir mit der Eisenbahn gefahren sind. Wir haben einen schönen Platz vorne in dem Hörsaal, der sich inzwischen gefüllt hat. Nun kommt plötzlich noch eine grosse Menge Leute, die man nicht erwartet hat und für die der Hörsaal zu klein ist. Unter ihnen auch Bekannte, die wir hier nicht erwartet haben, dabei auch Herr Moroni. Es wird dann verkündet, dass wir in einen anderen grösseren Hörsaal gehen werden, und ich beschliesse, dort schnell hin zu gehen, um wieder einen guten Platz vorne in dem Hörsaal zu bekommen. Der Kollege kann dann das Gepäck mitnehmen, das wir bei uns haben, während ich ohne dieses schon vorauslaufen und den Platz für uns beide besetzen kann. Das Gepäck hatte schon in einer vorhergehenden Szene bei der Abreise eine Rolle gespielt. Ich hatte einige Dinge zurückgelassen, im Glauben, diese nicht mehrt zu brauchen, sie aber dann im letzten Moment doch wieder mitgenommen und, da die Zeit zum Verpacken im Koffer nicht reichte, sie in einen grosseen weissen Sack getan. Diese Abreiseszene war aus einer noch früheren hervorgegangen, wo wir zusammen irgendwohin, wo wir Gäste waren, zum Essen gingen. Ich hatte zwei Strickjacken übereinander an, was aber zu heiss war, konnte aber nicht einfach nur die obere ausziehen, weil die untere für den Anlass nicht schön genug war, so dass ich zuerst beide ausziehen und dann die obere wieder anziehen musste. Aus der Frage, wie ich die untere aufbewahren und mitnehmen könne, war dann die Szene mit dem Gepäck bei der Abreise geworden,und der Transport dieses Gepäcks spielte dann bei der oben zuerst geschilderten letzten Szene eine Rolle, wo der Kollege dieses Gepäck mitnehmen muss, weil ich schon vorauslaufend einen Platz in dem grösseren Hörsaal reservieren will. Bei diesen Überlegungen wachte ich auf. (298 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3638 (1995-05-07, 06:30 - Zürich)Ich hatte etwas mit Urs Reichlin zu besprechen. Er schlug vor, dazu an einen Ort am Rande der Stadt zu gehen, wo es gemütlich sei. Dort hatte er ein Treffen arrangiert von Leuten seiner Firma. - er hatte eine Firma, die es irgendwie mit Büchern zu tun hatte - und Leuten der Uni, unseren ehemaligen Mitarbeitern im Institut. Auch Dieter Sträuli war da. Es war eine sehr harmonische Atmosphäre, die ich sehr genoss. Er rief zwischendurch, als wir gerade auf dem Hof standen, seinen Leuten, die man durchs Fenster oben in der Wohnung sah, verschiedenes zu, was sie jeweils machen sollten, und dies alles funktionierte sehr harmonisch und selbstverständlich. Später, nach dem Treffen, rief ich ihn an, um mich dafür zu bedanken. Es entspann sich ein längeres Gespräch, das sehr interessant war. Am Schluss wurde aber die Akustik schlecht, so dass ich ihn nur mit Mühe verstand und erwachte. (149 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3639 (1995-05-08, 03:45 - Zürich)Dieter Sträuli will mir, als ich im Institut zu Besuch bin, bei irgend einer Sache helfen. Etwas Technisches funktioniert aber nicht und er beginnt, es zu reparieren, braucht dafür aber enorm viel Zeit, obwohl es nicht kompliziert ist, und geht schliesslich mit der Sache in der Hand hinaus, lässt aber eine kleine Blechschachtel zurück, auf die er etwas geschrieben hat, das ich nun zu lesen beginne. Er beschreibt hier, dass er schon früher oft sich habe aufregen müssen, wenn ich gekommen sei, und dann einfache Sachen nicht habe machen können, weil er sich habe zurückziehen müssen, um wieder zur Ruhe zu kommen. Es ist eine lange Geschichte und ich wundere mich im Erwachen noch, wie er sie auf die relativ kleine Blechschachtel gebracht hat, die ich nun einstecke, um sie nicht im Institut liegen zu lassen.

Ich war gerade bei Tina, die sich vorbereitete, dorthin zu gehen. Sie erzählte, dass Hans Bender dort einen Vortrag halten sollte und auch ein anderer Professor kommen sollte, den ich kannte, dessen Namen ich aber wieder vergessen habe. Ich ärgerte mich ein bisschen, dass sie uns nicht eingeladen hatten, wusste aber andererseits, dass es dann eigentlich zu viel werden würde, auch dorthin zu gehen. (81 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3642 (1995-05-10, 02:30 - Zürich)Eine Vorlesung oder Vortrag, die sich in verschiedener Geschwindigkeit gleichsam in Raum und Zeit ausbreiten. Aber es ist ein roter Faden da, dem man folgen kann. Doch im selben Raum sind auch Kinder, die ebenfalls im Raum ihren Wegen folgen und oft an den Rand des Raums geraten, so dass man sie gleichzeitig mit dem Zuhören streng beachten muss, damit sie nicht hinaus geraten. Die Eltern passen aber nicht immer genau auf und so muss ich es tun. Im letzten Moment bemerken es aber auch die Eltern, wenn die Kinder zu sehr an den Rand geraten. (96 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3643 (1995-05-11, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich war mit Helmuth Enke in einem Raum, der der Schalterhalle einer Bank glich, aber auch wie eine Klinik war. Wir verstanden uns gut. Ich hatte ihm etwas erklärt in einer Sichtweise, die ihm neu war und ihn nachdenklich machte. Dann andere Szene. Es war inzwischen Morgen. Er sass hinter uns und redete mit einer Frau, deren Stimme wir hörten. Später ging ich eine Strasse entlang und merkte, dass es ein junger Mann gewesen war, was wir der Stimme nach für eine Frau gehalten hatten, denn dieser Mann kam auf dem Weg an mir vorbei. Dann andere Szene: Auf einem Berg, der wie eine Stufenpyramide gebildet war. Aber die Stufen waren so abgeschliffen und schmal, dass man abzurutschen drohte. Da der Berg hoch und steil war, wäre das sehr gefährlich gewesen. Ich rutschte mehrfach ab, konnte mich aber jedesmal wieder fangen. In einer anderen Traumszene, von der ich nicht mehr weiss, ob sie vorher oder hinterher war, begrüsste ich Helmuth Enke am nächsten Morgen beim Frühstück. Auch hier war die Sitzanordnung und die Aufstellung der Frühstückstische irgendwie wie bei der Stufenpyramide, so dass ich mich herunterbeugen musste, um ihm die Hand zu geben. Auch hier war das Gefühl des Einverständnisses gross. (201 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3644 (1995-05-12, 03:45 - Zürich)Jemand, der eine Hirnoperation an sich selber ausführte. Das geschah als Experiment im Dienste der Wissenschaft. Es war geplant, dass er die Operation immer weiter fortsetzen sollte, wobei nach und nach seine psychischen Fähigkeiten ausfallen würden. Glücklicherweise hörte er aber auf, nachdem er am Anfang offenbar eine Stelle gefunden hatte, deren Operation ihn psychisch nicht veränderte. Erwachen mit Kopfschmerzen. Eine andere Szene war vorhergegangen, die von unserer Wohnung handelte, die aber im Traum anders angeordnet war als in Wirklichkeit. Die Zimmer waren um einen grossen Flur angeordnet, und die Wohnung wirkte räumlich sehr harmonisch. Ich hatte das vorher nie richtig bemerkt, sass jetzt auf einem Stuhl, betrachtete es und genoss es, während in einem der Zimmer schon etwas Wissenschaftliches vorbereitet wurde, woraus wohl später die Hirnoperation wurde, was aber im Anfang noch harmlos war. Im Anfang hatte man mir zugemutet, die Hirnoperation an mir selbst auszuführen, wogegen ich mich aber wehrte, obwohl es im Dienste der Wissenschaft geschehen sollte, so dass ich bei meiner Abwehr etwas ein schlechtes Gewissen hatte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3645 (1995-05-13, 05:30 - Zürich)Ich versuche, Emme den Edlen von Hohenpiepen und sein Verhalten zu erklären. Das ist eine Witzfigur, an der das Verhalten eines Adligen charakterisiert wird. Wir fahren mit Fahrrädern durch die Stadt, und als wir dabei einem anderen Radfahrer den Weg abschneiden und dieser nur höflich mit seinem Rad zur Seite geht, sage ich, dass der Edle von Hohenpiepen eben immer höflich ist. In einer anderen Szene fahren wir mit der Strassenbahn durch eine Stadt, die wir nicht kennen, und müssen zum Hotel zurückfinden. Ich versuche sorgfältig, den Weg mit genau den selben Linien rückwärts zu nehmen, denn wir sind auch umgestiegen, und hoffe so den Weg zum Hotel zurück zu finden. In einer noch anderen, früheren Szene war ich allein in einem Vorort wie Küsnacht am Abend und wurde so lange mit Lapalien aufgehalten, dass keine Bahn mehr ging. Ich überlegte, wie ich in die Wohnung zurückkommen könne und ob ich versuchen sollte, Emme anzurufen, denn ein Taxi wäre sehr teuer. Vielleicht könnte jemand mich mit dem Auto holen (169 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3646 (1995-05-14, 03:10 - Zürich)Besuch bei Gadamer und seiner Frau in Heidelberg. Sie empfangen mich sehr herzlich und man sieht, dass sie sich freuen. Ich bin nach einer längeren Autofahrt dort angekommen.Jemand hat mich mit dem Auto dorthin gebracht. Dann längeres Gespräch mit Gadamer über Sachen, die ich geschrieben habe. Gadamer hat sie sorgfältig gelesen und man sieht, dass sie ihm gefallen. Es ist eine sehr harmonische Atmosphäre und ich freue mich. Vorher andere Szene, wo ich durch einen langen unterirdischen Tunnel gehe, der auf der anderen Seite in einem Weinberg endet. Man sieht die Weinranken durch die Spalte der Abdeckplatte des Tunnelendes. Es ist eine geheimnisvolle aber zugleich auch bergende Umgebung. Der Tunnel läuft unter dem Haus durch. Es geht dabei um irgendwelche wichtigen und wertvollen Dinge wie Gold. Ich trete kurz an dem Weinbergende aus der Tür, die den Tunnel abschliesst und die dabei zufällt, kann sie aber wieder öffnen und in den Tunnel zurückgelangen, da der Schlüssel noch steckt. Von innen gibt es einen Mechanismus zum Abschliessen und Aufschliessen der Tür, der irgendwie oben an der Tür befestigt ist und mit dem ich sie sorgfältig wieder schliesse, ehe ich durch den Tunnel zum Eingang zurückgehe. Später rede ich mit anderen über diesen Tunnel, die ihn auch kennen und auch dort waren. Er scheint in den Alpen zu sein,wohl auf der Alpensüdseite, wo der Tunnel in den Weinbergen endet.Es ist, als wenn er nicht nur unter dem Haus, sondern zugleich auch irgendwie unter den Alpen durchginge. Das Gespräch ist aber wieder im Norden. Die Szene mit Gadamer schloss wohl daran an, beziehungsweise die Atuofahrt, die mich zu ihm brachte. (267 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3649 (1995-05-15, 05:45 - Zürich)Ich bin im C.G.Jung-Institut, wo ich einen Vortrag oder eine Vorlesung über Kunst halten soll. Der Saal wird schon vorbereitet. Jemand stellt die Leinwand zum Projizieren der Dias auf und ein anderer ordnet die Stühle. Ich sitze vorne an einem Tisch und bereite mich vor und bin noch mit meinem Manuskript beschäftigt. Als ich einmal aufstehe und zum Nachdenken hin und her gehe, finde ich hinterher den Stuhl nicht mehr am Tisch. Jemand hat ihn schon in die Reihe der Zuhörerstühle gesetzt. Ich überlege, ob ich ihn zurückholen soll. Es scheint aber nicht nötig, da die Vorlesung bald beginnen wird. Das Institut wird von einer jungen Frau geleitet, die auch vorne steht und mit jemand spricht. Sie heisst Jung und ist eine Nachkommin C.G.Jungs. Sie trägt eine hemdartige Bluse, die sich bei einer Bewegung, die sie macht, so bewegt, dass darunter die Haut sichtbar wird wie bei einem bauchfreien Kleid. Sie wirkt anregend und sympathisch. Dann eine andere Szene. Jetzt ist es eine Besprechung dort und eine andere Frau, die eine Art Unterinstitut leitet, ist ebenfalls dort. Die ist kurz vor dem Weinen, weil die andere Frau ihr bei der Leitung offenbar nicht freie Hand lässt, sondern eingreift. Sie sagt, dass sie weinen könnte, und die andere erwidert, dass sie es doch tun solle. Mir ist aber die Gesamtleiterin die sympathischere. Ich bin dann aufgewacht und habe zuerst gedacht, dass ich gar keinen Traum zum Aufschreiben hätte, bis ich bemerkte, dass die eben beschriebene Szene ja ein Traum war, aus dem ich gerade aufgewacht war, während ich sie vorher im Erwachen wohl noch für Wirklichkeit hielt.

Ich beschloss, es doch aufzuheben. Ich wusste nicht mehr genau, wie es zu mir gekommen war. Vielleicht mit der Sendung der Bände der gesammelten Schriften Binswangers, die mir seine Tochter Hilde Binswanger geschickt hatte. Vielleicht war es bei ihr ein Begleitzettel gewesen zu etwas, was sie bekommen hatte. (101 words)

Auch jetzt sind viele junge Leute da, die sozusagen die Erinnerung daran zelebrieren. Unter ihnen ein Weisser, der aber an Teilen seines Körpers eine dunkle Haut hat. Er glaubt, dass er durch eine Art geistige Nachahmung so geworden ist. Ich sage, dass es doch auch sein kann, dass er irgend welche genetischen Anteile hat, die ihn so werden liessen. Er sagt: "Das sagen sie alle", besteht aber auf seiner Theorie, dass er durch geistige Nachahmung so geworden ist, und man sieht, dass ihm das sehr wichtig ist. Ich sage deshalb zu ihm, dass er das auch glauben darf, wenn es ihm wichtig ist. Im Erwachen kommt mir die Idee, dass es doch in Indien viele dunkelhäutige Europide gibt und dass er die Vorstellung, ein solches indisches Erbgut unter anderen in sich zu haben, vielleicht akzeptieren würde, weil es aus Indien kommt.

Andere Szenen waren vorhergegangen, wo ich in einem grossen, architektonisch sehr grosszügig um eine Halle angelegten Hotel in England war, wo ich morgens im Bademantel durch die Gänge und über die Treppen ging.

Ich bemerkte dies, als ich gerade im Begriff war, in die Universität zu gehen, um eine Vorlesung oder ein Seminar zu halten, denn in der Mappe waren auch die Unterlagen zu dieser Vorlesung. Ich war sehr beunruhigt, denn die Vorlesung war bald und ich musste jetzt zur Universität losgehen. Im Anfang des Traumes war es eher so, dass die hiesige Universität und das Londoner Museum gleichsam in der selben Stadt waren. Erst gegen Ende des Traums war mir ganz bewusst, wie weit entfernt beide voneinander sind. Ich sprach mit Emme, was ich jetzt tun solle, und überlegte, ob ich in dem Museum anrufen solle. Ich fragte Emme, wie Aktentasche auf englisch hiesse und was für eine Farbe eigentlich meine Tasche habe. Ich könne sie mir im Augenblick garnicht richtig vorstellen und habe sie nicht vor Augen. Allmählich kam aber das Bild der Mappe wieder. Im Erwachen versuchte ich, englische Sätze zusammen zu bringen, die das Wesentliche sagen würden, und überlegte nun auch, ob eine Reise nach London zum Holen der Mappe möglich wäre. (194 words)

Einer der Leute der Diktatur raunte mir zu: "Morgen kommen die dran", damit die Intellektuellen und Braven meinend, "da werden sie alle verhaftet und dann ihre Vergangenheit durchleuchtet." In diesem Moment wurde ganz kurz der Raum durchsichtig und man sah in der Tiefe der Räume eine riesige Maschinerie, in der es aufglühte, wenn sie arbeitete. Es war wohl eine Maschine, in der die Vergangenheit der Leute gespeichert war. Mir wurde klar, dass man die Leute warnen und die Öffentlichkeit aufrütteln musste, weil es jetzt vielleicht noch nicht zu spät war, etwas dagegen zu tun. Dann wachte ich auf. (126 words)

So hatte ich schon gestern den ersten Tag versäumt, weil es einfach immer später geworden war. Ähnlich drohte es heute zu werden. So fand ich meine Kleider nicht zusammen und als ich etwas aus der Hosentasche ziehen wollte, kamen lauter andere Sachen heraus. Schals, Handschuhe und ähnliche Wollsachen, die ich jetzt nicht brauchte. Ich drückte sie Emme in die Hand, mit der Bitte, sie für mich zu versorgen, und ebenso tat ich es mit lauter Papieren, die ich bei mir hatte und die mit der Schule garnichts zu tun hatten. Sie waren ganz ungeordnet, ein Teil aufzuheben, ein Teil wegzuwerfen, und weil ich keine Zeit hatte, sie zu ordnen, bat ich Emme, sie ebenfalls irgendwo zu versorgen. Inzwischen flog die Zeit dahin,und ich überlegte, ob ich den Aufbruch aufgeben solle und behaupten, ich sei krank gewesen und habe Grippe gehabt. Aber das hatte den Nachteil, dass ich mich dann draussen nicht frei bewegen und andere Vorhaben, die ich hatte, ausführen könnte. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwachte ich und fühlte mich erschöpft.

So hatte ich mich schon einmal verlaufen. Wenn man sich in Gruppen zu zweit oder zu dritt zusammentat, ging es besser, aber auch so irrten wir vom Wege ab und kamen zu einem Gewässer in der Mitte der Stadt. Ich hatte schon gemerkt, dass wir vom Wege abkamen, hatte aber nichts gesagt, weil ich dachte, die anderen kennten den Weg besser.

Ich konnte dort an einem zylinderförmigen Gerät arbeiten, das auf einem Tisch in einem der Wohnzimmer stand und der Behandlung von Papier diente, das man in eine schnabelartige Öffnung hineinschieben konnte und das dann zerhackt aber auch irgendwie verwandelt wurde. Das brauchte ich im Zusammenhang mit meiner Arbeit oder Untersuchung. Das Zimmer, in dem Herr v. Oertzen wohnte, war ganz in der Nähe. Die Räumlichkeit war aber teilweise anders als in Roggow, und andere Güter haben wohl mit hineingewirkt. Gegen Morgen, als ich noch verschlafen war, kam eine grössere Menschenmenge, es waren Besucher, begleitet von einem Kind, das zum Haus gehörte und das laut rief: "Die Führung" Gemeint war eine Führung, die ich früher einmal durch das Haus gemacht hatte und die den Leuten sehr gut gefallen hatte. Das Kind meinte, ich sollte diese mit diesen anderen Leuten, die ein wenig biedemeierartig angezogen waren, wiederholen. Ich fragte das Kind, wer das gesagt habe, und es sagte Susi. Das war ein Mitglied der Familie in dem Traum, und ich musste es wohl machen. Ich trug noch den Bademantel und war noch ziemlich verschlafen, hatte Mühe, mich zu besinnen, was ich damals gesagt hatte, ich hatte wohl vor allem vom Barockzeitalter gesprochen. Bei diesen Überlegungen erwachte ich. (207 words)

Als ich nun fragte, ob sie sehr teuer gewesen sei, bejahte sie dies, während alle anderen Sachen, die sie gekauft hatte, billig waren. Mir wurde nun klar, dass ich überhaupt keine Pfeife brauche, und ich überlegte, ob man sie zurückgeben könne. Dazu musste man den Kassenzettel suchen. Ich dachte mir aus, dass Emme der Verkäuferin sagen könne, dass ich mir gerade das Rauchen abgewöhnt hätte. Das wäre sicher ein plausibler Grund. Anders wäre es natürlich, wenn auch mein Monogramm auf die Pfeife eingebrannt wäre, was ich mir lebhaft vorstellte, so dass ich es momentweise sogar glaubte. Das war aber glücklicher Weise nicht der Fall. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. (130 words)

Es sind mehrere solche Kreise. Die Grabsteine sind aufragende kegelförmige Findlinge oder Steingebilde. Ich umarme einen von hinten, so wie man einen Menschen von hinten umarmen kann.

Dort musste ich hin, um morgen dort einen Vortrag zu halten oder an irgendetwas teilzunehmen. Jetzt war es Nacht und ich hatte kein Geld., wusste aber, dass schon Lastzüge Leute mitgenommen hatten. So ging ich zu einem Platz, wo sie abgestellt waren und in der Nacht wie grosse Ungeheuer standen. Ich klopfte an verschiedenen, ohne ein Reaktion hervorzurufen. Schliesslich reagierte jemand in einem, eine Stimme, die verschlafen aus ganz grosser Höhe der turmartig hohen Führerkabine klang. Ich begann nun zu reden, von einem Kongress hier über Schlaf, wo auch der Traum vorkomme. Er sagte, er habe davon gehört. Als ich weiter ausholte, um mein Anliegen zu begründen, rief er schimpfend: "Mensch Sie haben uns mitten in der Nacht geweckt. Sagen Sie endlich, was Sie wollen!" Ich rief zurück: Ich wollte Sie fragen, ob Sie mich morgen nach Split mitnehmen können." Er reif kurz und bündig zurück "Ja" und ich erwachte. (173 words)

Aber das Zimmer wird zugleich von drei Landstreichern mit benutzt. Das scheit eine Art Gewohnheitsrecht zu sein. Es gibt auch keinen Schlüssel zum Abschliessen des Zimmers. Wir verstehen uns zwar mit den Landstreichern gut, nehmen aber doch lieber ein anderes Zimmer oben im Haus, das auch ein Bad hat. Wir müssen vielleicht auch Tobi hüten, wofür das besser ist. Wir sind am späten Nachmittag vor der Abreise in dem Zimmer und ich sage zu Emme, dass es doch ein schönes Zimmer sei. Sie stimmt etwas zögernd zu, weil sie wohl denkt, dass ich doch noch einen Nachteil entdecken werde. Gegen Abend kommt das Mädchen herauf und sagt, dass um sieben Uhr abends eine Grenze ist. Wenn man auch nur eine Minute länger bleibt, gilt des als weitere Nacht, die man bezahlen muss. Ich sage, dass wir gehen wollen, gehe, sozusagen im Scherz, einmal durch die Tür und sage "Wir sind gegangen". Das Mädchen sagt, dass es ok sei. Wir müssen aber noch die Koffer packen und ich beginne alle Wollpullover, die wir nicht gebraucht haben, weil es sehr warm ist, wieder in den Koffer zu legen. Das Mädchen, zu dem wir sagen, ob es sich nicht noch bei uns in dem Zimmer ausruhen will, sagt, dass es jetzt wieder herunter in die Küche gehen muss, um das Abendessen zu machen. Es ist ein sehr südliches Haus, in dem alle Wände innen und aussen geweisselt sind. Es sind auch sehr dicke Wände, weil es ein altes Haus ist. Im Erwachen denke ich noch, dass eine Grenze zum Verlassen des Hotels erst abends um sieben Uhr eigentlich sehr grosszügig ist. (285 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3676 (1995-06-04, 05:00 - Zürich)Ich mache eine Reise durch ein fremdes Land. Im Hotel sind die Möbel farbig angemalt, zum Beispiel blau, gelb und rot, damit man sich besser orientieren kann. Ich kenne mich aber noch wenig aus. Vorher andere Szene: Die Kinder und einige andere junge Leute haben irgendwoher Geld bekommen, aber jeder eine verschiedene Menge und zu einer verschiedenen Zeit. Sie haben dies alles nun zusammengelegt und jeder bekommt je nach Situation, was er braucht. Durch dieses System reicht es für alle gut. Mir imponiert diese Regelung, die von ihrem guten Zusammenhalt zeugt. (91 words)

Es ist sozusagen ein Übergang von Tier zu Pflanze. Irgendwie bin ich auch selbst dieses Tier. Andere Szene. Ich bin, auf dem Weg zum Kunsthaus, unterwegs in der Asylstrasse oder eigentlich schon in Hottingerstrasse beziehungsweise einer ähnlichen Strasse. Die Stadt ist auch irgendwie anders als Zürich und eine andere Stadt. Ich will eine Strassenbahn kriegen, bin aber von der Haltestelle immer noch zu weit entfernt, wenn diese kommt, laufe zwar, kann sie aber nicht mehr einholen und erreiche sie nicht. Dieser Vorgang wiederholt sich drei mal. Wieder andere Szene. Wir wohnen in einer Wohnung mit sehr harmonischen Räumen und ich muss aufbrechen zu einer Vorlesung, die ich jenseits eines Tobels halten muss, durch den ich gehen oder fahren muss. Die Lage ist so, wie wenn der Ort der Vorlesung jenseits des Trichtenhauser Tobels etwa in Zollikerberg wäre. Die Vorbereitungen zum Aufbruch ziehen sich hin und die Zeit wird immer knapper. Jemand will mich im Auto mitnehmen, ich möchte aber vor der Vorlesung, die von Kunst handelt, lieber allein sein. Erwachen mit starken Kopfschmerzen und dem Gefühl schwerer Beine. (209 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3678 (1995-06-07, 01:00 - Zürich)Spaziergang in einer parkartigen Landschaft, wobei wir zugleich Übungen für einen Wettkampf machen. Es beginnt mit einer Rolle vorwärts, die in einer grabenartigen leichten Vertiefung anfängt. Dazu muss man sich ganz tief mit dem Kopf niederbeugen, ehe man sich fallen lässt, damit man nicht zu hart mit dem Kopf aufschlägt. Ich beuge mich langsam immer tiefer herab, bis die Bewegung schliesslich gleitend in die Rolle übergeht, die sich der Formation der Landschaft anpasst und in mehreren Überschlägen immer weiter geht, ohne dass ich mit dem Kopf eigentlich den Boden überhaupt berührt habe. Es ist, als ob ich direkt über das wellige Profil des Bodens hinwegschwebe und dabei gleichsam dessen Struktur mit der rollenden Bewegung nachzeichne, bis ich schliesslich sanft lande. Die Übung ist so gut gelungen, dass es den Anschein hat, dass ich dafür den ersten Preis bekommen werde. Das wundert mich sehr, da ich eigentlich ganz unsportlich bin. Ich erwache mit einem relativ entspannten Gefühl des Nackens, der in den letzten Tagen eher verspannt gewesen war, was auch mit Kopfweh verbunden war, die jetzt weg sind. (177 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3679 (1995-06-08, 06:00 - Zürich)Gemeinsames Essen in einem Haus und einer Gegend, wo hauptsächlich Juden wohnen. Einer von ihnen heisst Knechtholz. Es war schon mehrfach von ihm die Rede. Es heisst, dass er sich hier in einem Haus als Diener hat anstellen lassen. Vorher hiess es das selbe schon in einem anderen Haus, wo ich massiert wurde. Er war offenbar ein gebildeter Mann. Ich habe auch ein Auto bei mir, finde aber kaum einen Parkplatz dafür, parke es schliesslich vor einem ziemlich entfernten Haus, gehe noch einmal hin und sehe nach, ob es auch nicht einem anderen Auto den Weg versperrt, beschliesse, doch liebe kein Auto zu besitzen, weil es doch nur Mühe macht. Beim Essen sitzt neben mir ein Mann, der sehr gerne die Sauce von Roten Beeten isst und solche noch auf dem Teller eines anderen findet, der sie zurückgelassen hat. Er fragt diesen, ob es ihm etwas ausmacht, wenn er sie aufisst. Der Mann hat etwas Ähnlichkeit mit meinem Bruder, ist aber jemand anders. (163 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3680 (1995-06-09, 05:30 - München)Ich hatte vor meiner Wohnung einen langen Balkon, auf dem ich nachts zum Trocknen meine kleinen Taschenregenschirme aufstellte. Mönche gingen dort vorbei, die offenbar an der Stirnseite des Balkons ihre Wohnung hatten und auf dem Balkon promenierten. Plötzlich sah ich, wie ein ungeschickter und unsympathischer junger Hauswart den Schirm mit flüchtigen und unkonzentrierten Bewegungen zusammenklappte und dabei kaputt machte, so dass der Stoff sich von einem der Stäbchen des Gestells löste. So hatte ich die Schirme schon öfter, wenn ich sie wieder reinholte, gefunden und wusste nun, wer die Ursache war. Ich war wütend und rief den Hauswart, der noch vor dem Fenster auf dem Balkon war, an, um ihn zur Rede zu stellen. Er wollte in seiner unruhigen und fahrigen Art ausweichen, und ich rief ihm energisch zu: "Kommen Sie her, bleiben Sie stehen, hören Sie mich in Ruhe an". Es war sehr schwer, ihn so weit zur Ruhe zu bringen, dass er überhaupt zuhörte. Ich sagte: "Das sind meine Schirme. Die rühren Sie in Zukunft nicht mehr an. Haben Sie mich verstanden". Dann wachte ich auf. Vorher noch andere Traumszene, wo man mir in einer Werkstatt der Universität das Bild einer Stadt zeigte, das ich 1973, also vor mehr als zwanzig Jahr, gezeichnet und ganz vergessen hatte. Es sollte offenbar auf irgend einen Metallgegenstand eingraviert werden. Das Bild gefiel mir sehr gut. Es zeigte eine Stadt mit vielen Türmen und Dachbekrönungen. (233 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3681 (1995-06-10, 06:00 - München)Wir waren irgendwo in einem alten Haus. Ich hatte eine Versteinerung, die aus einer flachen Platte voller Muscheln, wie ein Strandstück, bestand, auf den Boden gelegt. Emme setzte mit dem Stuhl rückwärts und geriet dabei auf die Versteinerung. Diese zerbrach aber nicht, sondern löste sich in lauter einzelne Schichten auf, aus denen sie ursprünglich zusammengesetzt war und die so dünn wie Blätter und sogar leicht elastisch waren, aber von denen jedes die ganze Struktur mit allen Muscheln enthielt. Ich war einerseits betrübt über die Auflösung des Stückes, andererseits irgendwie auch fasziniert von ihrer Auseinanderfaltung in die vielen Blätter, die jetzt gleichsam wie Blätter eines Buches waren. Es wurde mir bewusst, dass ich selber die Ursache war, weil ich die Versteinerung auf den Fussboden gelegt hatte. (125 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3682 (1995-06-11, 05:30 - München)Ich war mit Bille und Tina und Freunden von ihnen und Jugendlichen im Keller eines grossen Hauses, wo sie aus Holz, das dort lag, eine Art Pfeiler oder Traggestelle herstellten für Zelte, die bei einem Fest verwendet werden solten. Es waren sozusagen Innenpfeiler für die Zelte. Bille hatte eine sehr kunstvolle halbkreisförmige Konstruktion mit vielen Verstrebungen gemacht, die man geschickt zum Transport zusammenklappen konnte. Über dem Keller war ein grosser durchgehender hallenartiger Raum, der wie ein Kirchenschiff wirkte. Als ich gerade dort war, kam eine Art Kommission von Leuten, die wie Polizisten wirkten und den Jugendlichen, die in dieser Halle waren, Fragen stellten und sie etwas pfadfinderhaft belehrten. Sie schienen aber Polizisten zu sein. Ich ging schnell die Kellertreppe herunter und sagte es den anderen, dann sie hatten eigentlich nicht die Berechtigung, das Material, das dort lag und das sie verwendeten, zu benutzen. Nun reagierten sie sehr verschiedenartig. Einige, wie Bille, machten einfach weiter, um auch den Anschein zu erwecken, dass alles in Ordnung sei und sie völlig rechtmässig hier wären. Andere verzogen sich in den Hintergrund, und ein Jugendlicher versteckte sich unter einem Stuhl, unter dem er aber der Länge nach hervorragte.Ich ging zu ihm, nahm den Stuhl über ihm weg und erklärte ihm, dass er so ja ganz besonders auffällig sein würde. Die Tür zu der nach oben führenden Treppe hatten wir zugemacht und stellten horchend fest, dass es oben ruhiger wurde. Offenbar hatten die Leute von der Kommission oder von der Polizeikontrolle garnicht gemerkt, dass hier unten noch ein Keller war, und waren vielleicht schon wieder gegangen. Dieser Traumszene, aus der ich dann erwachte, waren noch andere vorhergegangen, die wohl in dem selben Gebäude spielten, das sich oben viele Stockwerke hoch erhob und in dem es an verschiedenen Stellen Aufzüge gab, die in die Etagen und zu den Zimmern führten, so dass die Orientierung schwierig war, weil man nicht auf den ersten Blick erkennen konnte, bei welchem Aufzug man sich befand.

Ein entenartiger mit langem flachen breiten Schnabel war besonders auffällig. Er sass ganz ruhig auf einem Möbelstück, auch wenn man sehr nahe herankam. Emme rief deswegen eine Vogelwarte an und beschrieb ihn. Bille war auch da. Als ich zurückkam in das Zimmer, waren viele eher hühnerartige und schwarz-weiss getupfte grosse Vögel da, die nun auf den Möbeln sassen. Es waren aber ebenfalls Wildvögel. (82 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3684 (1995-06-13, 06:30 - München)Gespräche mit einer offenbar schizophrenen Frau, die Gadamers Schwester ist. Sie ist sehr exzentrisch und hat das Bild eines Mannes, in den sie verliebt ist, auf ihren Arm geklebt wie ein Armband. Später spreche ich mit diesem Mann selbst und erfahre, dass sie schon viele Schübe hatte und in Kliniken war. Dann Gespräche mit zwei jungen Mädchen aus der Nachbarschaft. Wir sitzen zu dritt ganz eng zusammen und sind glücklich. Es ist aber eine Versuchungssituation. Plötzlich beginnt die eine auf mein Bein zu blasen, wie man es bei einer kleinen Verbrennung tut. Ich wundere mich, sehe dann aber, dass sich dort eine Schwellung gebildet hat, die ganz schnell grösser wird und die sie damit offenbar bremsen will. Ich weiss, dass es harmlos ist, dass man aber die Schwellung vielleicht aufstechen muss. Das hat früher in einer ähnlichen Situation schon mal ein Arzt gemacht, der wiederum Gadamer ist und den man nun schnell rufen muss. Vielleicht kann man es aber auch selbst machen. Hier erwache ich.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3685 (1995-06-14, 03:30 - Zürich)Man konnte mit einer sehr modernistischen Bahn durch die Wildnis fahren in Afrika. Sie kam nur sehr selten, und es war unklar, ob sie anhalten würde. Dann hörte man sie aber kommen mit einem pfeifenden Geräusch. Man musste sich sehr nahe an die Hauswand drücken und auf sie warten, und es war nicht klar, ob der Platz, wo wir standen, eigentlich reichen würde, ohne dass man von ihr gestreift würde, denn sie war sehr schnell und es war ja nicht sicher, ob sie auch anhielt. Dann fanden wir aber eine Einmündung zwischen den Häusern, wo man sicher stehen konnte. Ich gab ein Handzeichen, als sie ankam, und sie hielt tatsächlich an. Sie bestand eigentlich aus zwei pfeilerartigen trichterförmigen Aufbauten auf den beiden Achsen, an denen man sich irgendwie hochziehen musste und auf denen man dann oben auf der Fläche liegen konnte. Aus dem vorderen Trichter schaute ein Eingeborener aus einem Fenster heraus und sagte zu Emme: "Du doch sein weisse Frau". Offenbar hatten sie gesagt,. dass sie solche nicht mitnehmen wollten. Emme war aber sehr braungebrannt und dadurch dunkel wirkend. Der Mann sagte: "Du haben Flugschein?" Emme antwortete "Ja, ja", und es fiel mir ein, dass sie ja früher Segelfliegerin und Fallschirmspringerin war. Der Mann sagte freundlich: "Dann ist es gut. Du kannst einsteigen". Zwei andere Leute, die mit uns gewartet hatten, waren schon dabei, sich an den trichterförmigen Pfeilern hoch zu ziehen, und als wir auch damit begannen, wachte ich auf. Die Bahn wirkte irgendwie surrealistisch, in der Gestalt wie halb organische Gebilde auf den Bildern Dalis. Die Trichter waren weisslich. (262 words)

Ich gelange unter einem Vorwand dorthin, um Tina zu sehen, indem ich behaupte, dass noch mir gehörige Zigaretten dort seien, die ich haben wolle. Ich sehe Tina dort auch, kann aber nicht mit ihr sprechen, erlebe aber, wie sie sie gerade über Dante Gabriel Rosetti verhören, weil sie wohl bei anderen Befragungen irgendwie auf den gekommen sind. Tina erklärt gerade, dass Rosetti für den Osten gewesen sei. Dann werde ich wegen der Zigaretten äusserst umständlich befragt. Schliesslich bekomme ich ein Blatt Papier, wo offenbar drauf steht, dass mir Zigaretten gehört hätten, und der Verhörende sagt, ich könne damit zu den jüdischen Händlern gehen, um mir Zigaretten dafür geben zu lassen. Er beschreibt auch die Stelle, wo diese Händler innerhalb des abgesperrten Gebietes der Russen sind. Ich vermute eine Falle und frage, ob ich denn das muss. Der Russe antwortet begeistert "Nein", weil er offenbar ein Antisemit ist. Auf dem Rückweg, nachdem ich Tina nochmal zugenickt habe, aber nichts für sie tun kann, erwache ich dann. und überlege mir noch, dass es zur Zeit Dante Gabriel Rosettis noch gar keine komunistische Herrschaft in Russland gab und was Tina sagen könnte, wenn sie darauf kommen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3689 (1995-06-17, 00:15 - Zürich)Ich war in Schwerin oder einer ähnlichen Stadt auf dem Wege zur Schule, wo ein Jubiläum des Abiturs gefeiert werden sollte. Teilweise war es aber auch so, als wenn wir jetzt erst das Abitur gemacht hätten oder noch machen müssten, wobei griechische Philosophie offenbar den Prüfungsstoff bildete, und ich vieles nicht wusste, sondern nur ergänzen konnte. Ich überlegte, ob ich wohl Jürgen Wächter dort treffen würde, den ich seitdem nicht mehr gesehen hatte und der jetzt also auch genau so wie ich viel älter aussehen müsste. Ich hatte aus irgendeinem Grunde keine eigenen Schuhe dabei, und jemand hatte mir Sandalen geliehen, in denen ich aber doch nur etwas mühsam gehen konnte. So überlegte ich, ob mir wohl jemand passende Schuhe leihen könnte. Auch Socken hatte man mir geliehen, die etwas wollig wirkten, und ich überlegte mir, ob diese Fussbekleidung wohl für die Feier passend wäre, dachte aber zugleich auch, dass man souverän sein müsse und dass, wenn man es wäre, niemand die ungewöhnliche Fussbekleidung ausdrücklich bemerken würde. Ich kam von der Seite an die Schule, die derjenigen von der ich früher auf dem Weg aus dem Schlossgarten kam, entgegengesetzt war, und ging so durch eine Gegend der sonst so vertrauten Strasse, durch die ich früher selten gekommen war. Ich hatte nur wenige Schritte bis zur Schule zu gehen. Mir fiel im Erwachen Freuds Theorie der Wunscherfüllung im Erwachen ein, die darin besteht, dass, wenn man geträumt hat, durchs Abitur gefallen zu sein, einem im Erwachen einfällt, dass man dieses ja in Wirklichkeit schon längst bestanden hat. Und ich überlegte mir, ob ich, falls ich eine Rede halten müsste, diese Geschichte von Freud erzählen solle. (274 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3692 (1995-06-19, 05:25 - Zürich)Emme und ich waren im Auto irgendwohin mitgenommen worden und wollten nun aussteigen. Unsere Koffer waren schon ausgeladen. Im letzten Moment merkte ich, ehe das Auto wieder abfuhr, dass vorne in der Fahrerkabine noch bei der Fensterscheibe unsere Terminkalender und ähnliches lagen, ein kleiner Stapel von Büchern, die ich nun noch an mich nahm. Es war auch wie ein Lastauto, das uns mitgenommen hätte, oder wie ein Autobus, der nun wieder weiter fuhr. Zuvor schon hatte ich meine Sandalen in der Führerkabine gesucht und nicht gefunden, als wir nach hinten gingen, um die Koffer auszuladen, und beschloss barfuss zu gehen. Es war hier gleichzeitig so, als ob der Weg nach hinten neben dem Auto wie der Weg nach unten in einem Haus wäre, etwa wenn man zum Briefkasten geht. Ich fand aber im letzten Moment, als wir losgingen, noch die Schuhe, die ich immer zum Traumaufschreiben nachts anziehe, und schlüpfte in diese, statt der Sandalen. Irgendwie spielte auch der Name Le Corbusier in dem Traum eine Rolle. Es war im Traum., als wir ausstiegen 05.25 Uhr, wohl auf der Uhr in der Fahrerkabine. Dann wachte ich auf, blickte auf die Uhr, wie ich es immer tue, wenn ich Träume aufschreiben will, und sah, dass es wirklich gerade 05.25 Uhr war. (210 words)

Ich machte es sorgfältig und gewissenhaft, und es war schön, danach jeweils die klaren Fenster und den freien Blick nach draussen zu sehen. Es war eine Arbeit, die zunächst ganz leicht scheint, bei der man aber doch seinen Arm sehr spürt, wenn man es die ganze Zeit lang macht. Vorher war eine andere Szene, wo es um die Bilder eines Malers ging, der Felix glich. Die Bilder waren auf einen starken Hell-dunkel-Gegensatz angelegt. Viele hingen in verdunkelten Zimmern, und wir zogen die Vorhänge auf, um die Farben richtig zu sehen. Daraus ging dann wohl die andere Szene in der Eisenbahn hervor, wo es ja auch um das richtige Sehen durch die Fenster geht. (137 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3695 (1995-06-21, 05:45 - Zürich)Wir hatten eine durch mehrere Etagen gehende Wohnung, die ein Haus ganz ausfüllte. Ich hatte eine besondere Methode entwicklet, die Treppe herabzulaufen, wenn es klingelte oder ich nach unten musste, die einen bestimmten Rhythmus hatte, den man auch akustisch auf den Holzstufen hörte. Draussen zog in der Ferne ein Gewitter herauf. Im Treppenhaus war irgendwo ein kleines zylinderartiges gelbes Gefäss angebracht, in dem für Belli, die noch zur Schule ging, ein chemisches Experiment ausgeführt wurde. Es lief irgend eine Reaktion zwischen Stoffen in dem Zylinder ab, die auch zu Schaum und Bewegung im Inneren führen sollte. Ich war mir aber nicht ganz klar, ob der Zylinder noch an seiner Stelle war, weil Leute von einer Firma gekommen waren, die Blumen brachten und diese in Vasen an den Wänden anbrachten, wobei sie die Wände auch putzten. Als ich aufwachte, war draussen ein ziemlich starkes Gewitter in Gang. (146 words)

Man wusste wissen, dass mitten im Türknauf ein kleiner Knopf war, den man drücken musste, damit die Tür sich öffnet. Direkt hinter der Tür war eine Garderobe, wo aber keine Mäntel hingen, weil die Leute offenbar die Gefahr sahen, dass sie dort so dicht an der Strasse gestohlen würden. So nahm ich auch meinen Tweedmantel mit hinein. In seinen Taschen hatte ich einen Stein, den ich oft mitnahm und in der Hand hielt. Ich hoffte, dass er nicht gestohlen würde, wenn ich den Mantel irgendwo hin legte, denn er war mir wichtig. Dann hatte ich auch meine Sonnenbrille im Etui bei mir, das ich noch in der Hand hielt, obwohl es schon Nacht war. Ich sollte irgend jemand dort treffen, wusste aber offenbar nicht ganz genau, wen. Es war ein Treffpunkt von jungen Leute. Dann traf ich das Mädchen, das Tina glich. Sie sagte, ich müsse erst noch eine Weile im Lokal auf und ab gehen, damit es nicht zu sehr nach Verabredung aussehe, wenn wir zusammen sässen. Offenbar musste es so wirken, als wenn wir uns ganz zufällig getroffen hätten. Also begann ich den Weg durch das Lokal, das aus langen etwas labyrinthischen gangartigen Räumen bestand. Dabei wachte ich auf. (217 words)

Ich bin froh, zu Hause zu sein und durch das Reich der Kindheit in den Zimmern zu gehen. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. Eine andere Szene war vorhergegangen, wo ich durch ein Lokal ging und im Vorbeigehen ein Mädchen sah, das Elena heisst und das sich gerade an einen Tisch setzte.

Ich stand unten vor dem Haus und sagte etwas darüber. Dann hörte ich unscharf eine Stimme, deren Akzent darauf hindeutete, dass es der Oberbewohner sein musste, sah ihn aber nicht. Er wollte mir offenbar den fehlenden Teil zu dem Gerät geben. Aber auch wenn ich mich drehte, konnte ich ihn und die Sache nicht sehen. Ich sagte: Ich sehe nichts und höre nichts. Da ergriff mich eine Hand bei der Hand und zog mich zu Boden. Jemand setzte sich neben mich. Es war Herr Sandor, den ich aber immer noch nicht sah. Und er begann nun, etwas wie eine Schnur, wohl eine Leitung in das bisher noch nicht funktionierende Gerät einzuziehen. Ich spürte das alles aber immer noch nur mit dem Tastgefühl.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3701 (1995-07-01, 01:00 - Zürich)Ich ging zusammen mit anderen in eine Vorlesung, die in einem kirchenartigen alten, wohl mittelalterlichen Gebäude stattfand. Wir waren zu spät und mussten zuerst noch ein langes Stück durch das dämmrige Kirchenschiff gehen. Ich hatte ein Kinderrad oder ähnliches Kinderfahrzeug bei mir, das ich nicht am Eingang absetzten mochte, weil es dort vielleicht gestohlen worden wäre. So nahm ich es mit durch den Kirchenraum und hoffte, dass man das wegen des Dämmerlichts nicht sehen würde. Erst kurz, bevor wir in den eigentlichen Vorlesungsraum kamen., setzte ich es ab. Dabei merkte ich, dass das, was ich nun absetzte, eigentlich nur ein Buch war, in dem das Kinderfahrzeug abgebildet war. Wir kamen nun in den Vorlesungsraum hinein, in dem die Vorlesung im Gange war. Die Bänke waren irgendwie kreisförmig, aber in lockerer Folge um den Dozenten angeordnet. Während die Anderen sich irgendwo am Rand hinsetzten, wo die Bänke aber kirchenstuhlartig unbequem waren, ging ich weiter nach unten und auf die Mitte zu in dem abschüssig angelegten Saal. So kam ich schliesslich ganz in die Nähe des Dozenten. Es war Ernst Jünger. Er schimpfte wie ein Lehrer, dass wir zu spät kämen, und sagte zu mir: "Warum kommen Sie denn so dicht zu mir, wenn Sie schon zu spät kommen?" Ich drehte mich um, denn beim Hinsetzen musste ich mich zunächst so drehen, dass ich ihm während dessen den Rücken zu wandte, und sagte . "Ich habe nicht gemerkt, dass ich auf diesem Platz so nahe bei Ihnen bin, aber ich freue mich darüber." Er fragte. "Warum kommen Sie denn überhaupt zu spät'" Ich antwortete: "Ich habe es vergessen", was der Wahrheit entsprach. Er erwiderte etwas ironisch, wie Lehrer es manchmal tun: "So, so, vergessen!" Als er noch weiter schimpfe, sagte ich zu ihm: "Sind Sie denn noch nie zu spät gekommen?" Er antwortete "Nein, nie". Ich sagte: "Haben Sie schon einmal gelogen?" Da musste er lachen und freute sich offensichtlich, weil er in einem seiner Bücher geschildert hatte, wie er zu spät zur Schule kam oder sie ganz schwänzte, und nun aus meiner Frage merkte, dass ich dieses Buch von ihm gelesen hatte. Es war eine gelassene und heitere Atmosphäre des Einverständnisses, aus der ich dann erwachte. (365 words)

Ich bin gerade beim Ordnen der Papiere und beschliesse, diese Blätter an die selbe Stelle zu legen wie das Vortragsmanuskript. Überlege auch, ob man das Tagebuch ausarbeiten sollte.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3706 (1995-07-05, 05:15 - Zürich)Ich muss einen Vortrag halten über Projektion und Natur. Die Zuhörer, es ist ein grosser Hörsaal, sind Tiefenpsychologen oder Psychotherapeuten, also in diesem Gebiet sehr vorgebildet, aber nicht im philosophischen. Zunächst sitzt in dem Hörsaal auch auf der Bühne eine ganze Reihe von Menschen, darunter auch ein Kind. Irgend eine andere Sache wird zuerst einleitend noch mitgeteilt, dann ist es plötzlich Zeit für den Beginn meines Vortrages. Ich muss zunächst die vielen Leute im Saal, die noch miteinander reden, zur Aufmerksamkeit bringen, was mir auch gelingt, indem ich laut "Meine Damen und Herren" sage. Dann muss ich mich aber irgendwie von der Reihe der Leute frei machen, die vorne auf der Bühne sitzen und neben denen ich stehe. Das gelingt mir, indem ich hinter ihnen auf und ab gehe und dabei über ihre Köpfe hinweg in Richtung auf die im Saal sitzenden Leute spreche. Aber schwierig ist es, dabei auch das Manuskript zu beachten, das ich in dieser Situation auch schlecht lesen kann. Ich löse mich deshalb davon, im Hin- und Hergehen die Zuhörer ansehend. Dabei verändert sich die Situation allmählich so, dass nun die ganze Hörsaalbühne frei ist. Ich bin irgendwie in den Vortrag hineingeraten und kenne eigentlich das Konzept nicht, beginne aber einfach sozusagen laut darüber nachzudenken, indem ich zuerst einmal sage, dass Projektion auf die Natur ja etwas andres zu sein scheint, als Projektion auf andere Menschen, weil sie ja auch Personen und als diese uns ähnlich sind. Nun sage ich, dass aber auch die Natur als Ganze schon in der Erkenntnis eine Projektion ist, und will nun auf Kant und Schelling eingehen, sage also, dass für Kant die Natur uns nur erscheinen kann, wenn wir gleichsam die Formen des Raumes und der Zeit auf sie projizieren und die Einheits-Formen des Erkennens. Hier ist es nun mein Plan, die Kausalität als Beispiel zu bringen, die wir schon gleichsam in uns kennen müssen, um sie in der Natur erkennen zu können. Dann will ich noch darauf eingehen, dass das Ich sozusagen seine Einheit der Natur leihen muss, damit diese ihm überhaupt als Ganze und Eine erscheinen kann, weil es sie ja nicht als Ganze in der Erfahrung durchschreiten kann. Danach soll die Bedeutung des Unbewussten in der Erkenntnis der Natur bei Schelling drankommen. Soweit sehe ich also, während ich rede, den weiteren Verlauf des Vortrags voraus, aber, wie es dann weitergehen soll, weiss ich nicht recht. Auch das Gesamtthema des Kongresses, auf das sich der Vortrag beziehen soll, ist irgendwie in weite Ferne gerückt. Und im Manuskript kann ich nicht nachsehen, weil es ganze zusammenhängende Sätze und Absätze enthält, so dass man schwer Stichworte herauserkennen kann, und es ausserdem in der Situation und Beleuchtung nicht richtig zu lesen ist. Ich muss mich also darauf verlassen, dass mir der Faden des Vortrags im Reden kommen wird. Dies alles überlege ich sozusagen nebenbei, während ich meine Sätze rede und wache dabei allmählich auf.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3708 (1995-07-07, 05:00 - Zürich)Beat und Esther bringen als Geschenk zu irgendeinem Anlass ein Buch, das aus den frühen vierziger Jahren stammt. Es stellt irgendwelche geschichtlichen Zusammenhänge dar und enthält auch Tabellen und Karten. Seine ganze Aufmachung und sein Stil sind ungeheuer typisch für diese Zeit und erinnern mich ganz lebhaft daran. Es ist, als wenn die Zeit selbst mit dem Buch lebendig würde. Es ist ja unsere Schulzeit. Ich war 1940 vierzehn Jahre alt. Ich merke, dass das Buch auch auf Emme ähnlich wirkt. Wir erklären den beiden das und sie fragen, woran denn das in dem Buch zu sehen ist. Ich sage, an bestimmten Zügen der graphischen Gestaltung, zum Beispiel, wie dieser Rand dieser Tabelle hier graphisch gestaltet ist. Nun erklären sie aber, dass sie noch eine Alternative zu dem Geschenk, also ein anderes Geschenk statt des Buches, haben und dass wir zwischen beiden wählen könnten. Esther erklärt, dass sie nämlich eine Sendung des Autors von Momo gehört haben, in der er wohl etwas vorliest, und dass es ihr mit grosser Mühe gelungen sei, eine Tonbandaufnahme davon vom Rundfunk zu erhalten. Offenbar können sie davon eine Kopie machen, die dann das Geschenk für uns wäre. Jetzt müssen Emme und ich uns entscheiden. Aber es ist ja schwierig, in dieser Situation in der Gegenwart der Gäste darüber zu reden. Doch glaube ich, Emmes Reaktion zu kennen, denn auch sie war von dem Buch aus den frühen vierziger Jahren sehr angetan und, während wir von Michael Endes erstem Buch "Lukas der Lokomotivführer", das Emme den Kindern und mir vorgelesen hat, sehr begeistert waren, hat uns der Kult, der um das spätere Buch, das von Momo handelt, entstand, irgendwie gestört. Darum nehme ich an, dass Emme ebenso wie ich das Buch als Geschenk vorziehen wird, weil es uns als Zeitzeugnis und etwas, das diese vergangene Zeit heraufbeschwört, sehr beeindruckt. Ich sage darum, dass ich glaube, schon zu wissen, wie Emme entscheiden wird, und dass wir wohl das Buch behalten wollen, begründe das aber, um nichts Negatives zu sagen, damit, dass wir kein Tonbandgerät haben.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3709 (1995-07-08, 06:45 - Zürich)Wir müssen Übungen machen im Stehen auf einem Bein. Während es mir zuerst dabei sehr schwer fällt, das Gleichgewicht zu halten, und alle Glieder in einer fliegenden unruhigen Bewegung sind, stellt sich plötzlich eine grosse Ruhe ein, als ich im Stehen den Kopf senke. Es ist, als ob eine Säule von unten hoch kommt, auf der der Kopf ruht. Ich kann jetzt mit dieser sozusagen vorgestellten oder imaginierten Stütze ganz ruhig und entspannt stehen, und bei völliger Ruhe aller Glieder, und wache dann auf. Die Säule war aber irgendwie gleichsam real wahrnehmbar in ihren Hochkommen. (95 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3710 (1995-07-09, 05:30 - Zürich)Ein Text, den ich im Computer in der Reihenfolge einzelner Textblöcke verändern musste. Das geschah in einer Weise, die eine Verbindung des Schneidens und neu Zusammenklebens des Papiers, wie man es früher gemacht hat, und der Verschiebung von Textblöcken im Computer war. Das Papier war irgendwie im Computer und wurde in ihm und durch ihn geschnitten und neu zusammengeklebt. (59 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3711 (1995-07-10, 02:30 - Zürich)Wir sind im Autobus fahrend von der Strasse abgekommen und rechts einen Hang heruntergerutscht. Dann hat der Autobus an einigen Bäumchen Halt bekommen. Jetzt ist die Frage, wie wir herauskommen sollen, denn die Türen sind bei den Bäumchen und dort darf man nichts unternehmen, weil die Gefahr besteht, dass sie dann nachgeben und der Bus in den Abgrund stürzt. Dann kommt jemand aussen von der Strasse her an den Bus herab, tastet das Dach ab und stellt fest, dass man es genau über mir zwischen zwei Stangen aufschneiden kann, so dass in dem Stoffdach ein Loch entsteht, aus dem man herausgezogen werden kann. Da das genau über meinem Kopf ist, werde ich als erster herausgezogen. Vorhergegangen war eine Szene, wo ich, schon verspätet, auf dem Wege irgendwo hin, auf eine Strasse gelange, die von einer Baustelle zerklüftet ist. Ich gehe auf einer Böschung entlang und habe die Hoffnung, dass dieser Weg weiterführen wird, was wohl auch der Fall ist. Von da hat es dann zur Szene im Autobus gewechselt. Noch früher war ich die Strasse, die sich dann in die Baustelle wandelte, hinaufgegangen und hatte grosse steinartige Gebilde gefunden, die ich aufheben wollte. Man konnte sie, sie mit dem Fuss anstossend die Strasse herabrutschen lassen. Ich beschloss, dies auf dem Rückweg zu tun, um auf diese Weise das Gebilde nach Hause bringen und aufheben zu können, und machte mir noch Sorgen, ob nicht die Baustellenarbeiter sie vorher schon entfernen könnten.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3712 (1995-07-11, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich bin in einem Haus, in dem eine Lesemaschine aufgestellt ist, in die das Buch eingespannt ist und die die Blätter selbsttätig umblättert. Sie tut das aber sehr langsam, so dass man nur langsam lesen kann. Man kann das Tempo nicht beeinflussen. Dann fahren wir auch Aufzug in dem Haus in einem sehr alten und klapperigen Aufzug, von dem man das Gefühl hat, er könne unterwegs stecken bleiben. Er kommt aber richtig in der oberen Etage an. Vorher andere Szene, wo ich in einer Situation bin, in der man alle seine Sachen bei sich tragen muss. Es ist schwierig, die Pässe so in den Hosentaschen oder Jackentaschen unterzubringen, dass sie nicht sich draussen als starre herausstehende Körper abbilden. Der ganze Traum ist also durch Dinge gekennzeichnet, die sperrig sind oder mühsam und langsam gehen. Ich wache dann auch langsam und noch sehr verschlafen auf. (144 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3713 (1995-07-13, 04:00 - Zürich)Ich suche einen Photohändler, wo man seinen Film zum Entwickeln und Kopieren abgeben kann, doch überall muss man stundenlang warten. In einem Warenhaus bedient ein Mädchen in der Photoabteilung, das plötzlich zwischendurch weggeht und einfach nicht wieder kommt und alle warten lässt, so dass sich eine Schlange bildet. Schliesslich fassen der Mann hinter mir und ich fast gleichzeitig den Entschluss, wegzugehen, weil es uns zu bunt wird. Ich überlege nun, in welches Geschäft, das ich von früher her kenne, ich gehen soll. Die ganze Zeit habe ich auch versucht, mir einzuprägen, was ich alles sagen muss, wie "matt" und "Standardkopien" und so weiter. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. (107 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3714 (1995-07-13, 06:30 - Zürich)Ich war in einem Hotel, wo eine Art Ferien- und Fitnes-Programm für die Gäste abgespult wurde. Ich war ihm fern geblieben und kam gerade die Treppe herunter, als ich einen munteren Manager, der das Programm für die Gäste ansagte und in Gang hielt und uns durch seine komische Munterkeit amusierte, gerade in südländischem Akzent meinen Namen ausrufen hörte: "Detlääf von Uslar". Offenbar hatte ich irgendetwas gewonnen. Die Gäste entfernten sich zum Teil aus dem Saal, und ich fragte jemand, ob er wisse, was es sei. Er sagte, mein Vater sei im Saal und wisse Bescheid. Ich konnte aber meinen Vater dort nicht zwischen den noch da sitzenden Leuten entdecken und näherte mich darum dem noch auf dem Rednerpult stehenden Manager. Ich wollte ihm meinen Namen nennen. Irgendjemand photographierte die Gäste. Ich dachte, dass er wahrscheinlich mich als Gewinner photographieren wollte, was er aber nicht konnte, da er mich nicht kannte. Ehe ich bei dem Katheder anlangte, um meinen Namen zu nennen, bin ich aufgewacht. (164 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3715 (1995-07-14, 00:30 - Zürich)Tina war in einer grösseren Anwaltspraxis als Juristin tätig. Ich wollte gerne mit dieser Praxis zusammenarbeiten, hatte mir dabei eine irgendwie schriftstellerische Tätigkeit vorgestellt. Offenbar wollte ich für sie Texte schreiben. Das hatte ich in einem Brief dargestellt, in den ich auch Texte aus Büchern aufgenommen hatte, die ich geschrieben hatte. Diesen Brief wollte ich nachts in einen Briefkasten an Tinas Parterrewohnung stecken, der am Fensterladen angebracht war. In Tinas Zimmer war aber noch Licht. Ich klopfte darum leicht an den Fensterladen, weil der Briefkasten schon voll war. Es steckte auch ein Buch darin. Sie hörte aber mein Klopfen nicht und lauter wollte ich nicht klopfen, weil es schon später in der Nacht war. In diesem Moment kamen Leute aus der Praxis heraus, auch Tina war dabei und der Manager der Praxis, der ein rundliches gerötetes Gesicht hatte, ein Pykniker war. Erst wollte ich ihn darauf aufmerksam machen, dass ich einen Brief an ihn geschrieben hätte, dann aber kam mir das doch komisch vor und ich fasste mir ein Herz und sagte direkt zu ihm. "Ich möchte gerne mit Ihrer Praxis zusammenarbeiten, etwas für Sie schreiben, zum Beispiel". Er zögerte erst, entwarf dann aber in schneller Rede ein Bild von etwas, das ich tun könnte. Ich verstand aber seine Rede akustisch nicht und schwieg erst einmal. Dann zog er einen Korbstuhl heran, der da stand und setzte sich darauf. Ich nahm, einen anderen Korbstuhl, auf dem viele Sachen lagen, die ich erst auf eine Couch zur Seite räumen musste, und setzte mich daneben. Es war jetzt eine Situation wie auf dem Flur der Praxis aus der Situation auf der Strasse vor der Praxis geworden. Ich sagte zu ihm, dass ich vorhin seine Rede akustisch nicht verstanden hätte und darum nichts gesagt hätte. Er sagte: "Ach deshalb". Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass seine etwas hektische managende Art mir eigentlich nicht läge und ich nicht recht wusste, ob das eigentlich die richtige Arbeit für mich sei. Auf jeden Fall wollte ich nicht vorschnell etwas zustimmen. Ein anderer junger Mann war noch da, der eher verstanden hatte, was ich eigentlich wollte und versuchte, dies zu erklären, in dem er sich ins Gespräch einmischte. Auch er schien eine wichtige Funktion in der Praxis zu haben Dann bin ich aber aufgewacht, ehe das Gespräch sich weiter entwickelte. (382 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3719 (1995-07-16, 06:15 - Zürich)In der Wohnung von Jürgen Mields waren blank polierte Tische, wo unter der Politur kleine Bläschen umherschlüpften, die eine Art Geister oder Gespenster waren und die man gut kannte, die gleichsam familiär vertraut waren. Nebenan war ein Haus aus dickem Gemäuer, in dem in Jugendstilart senkrechte Schlitze als Muster angebracht waren. Es sah sehr schön aus. Der Schwiegervater einer der Töchter hatte Geburtstag und im "Zürcher Student" war ein Artikel erschienen, in dem diese damals noch bevorstehende Geburtstagsfeier geschildert war. Es wurden viele Aufführungen für ihn gemacht, Kindertheater, Jugendtheater und wohl auch Aufführungen der Erwachsenen. Auch ich hatte in der Zeitschrift einen Artikel für ihn geschrieben. Jetzt war dieser Geburtstag. Emme und ich sassen neben ihm, und es lief gerade eine der Theateraufführungen ab. Im Gespräch stellte sich heraus, dass er die Ausgabe der Zeitschrift mit der vorwegnehmenden Schilderung dieses Geburtstags garnicht kannte, und Emme sagte zu mir, ich solle sie doch holen. Ich wusste nicht recht, ob ich sie finden würde, und sagte das. Vor meinem geistigen Auge sah ich verschiedene Ausgaben dieser Zeitschrift irgendwo in der Wohnung liegen und beschloss, mich auf den Weg zu machen, um die richtige zu suchen. Dann bin ich aufgewacht. (197 words)

Von diesem beginnt sich eine Schicht des Ovals abzulösen, dann eine weitere. Ich merke, dass er überhaupt ganz und gar aus solchen Schichten zusammengesetzt ist und im Begriff ist, sich auf diese Weise ganz aufzulösen. Emme glaubt aber, dass man ihn kleben kann. In einer anderen Szene ist es statt des Fingerrings ein lebensgrosser Bock an Stelle eines "Pferdes", der aus solchen Schichten besteht. Er hat vier Beine und das Spitzoval nimmt sozusagen die Stelle des Rückens ein, wie bei einem sogenannten "Pferd" in der Turnhalle, über das man springen kann. Es schienen im Laufe der Traumszne auch Dinge darauf zu liegen. (119 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3722 (1995-07-19, 02:30 - Zürich)In dem Traum kam ein Mädchen namens Barbara von Fumetti vor. Das Mädchen hatte wohl irgend einen leichten Unfall, etwa wie einen Jagdunfall, gehabt und lag in einer Klinik, wo ich sie durch Zufall traf und wohl jemandem versprochen hatte, sie wieder zu besuchen. Die Erinnerung an die ganz Szene ist nur sehr undeutlich und der Rest ist eher wie ein Erzählung oder eine lebhafte Phantasievorstellung, die aber viel genauer in meiner Erinnerung ist. Diese Vorstellung war, dass ich Jahrzehnte vorher ebenfalls, im Krieg,e ein Mädchen namens Barbara von Fumetti getroffen hätte, die ich damals besucht und später aus den Augen verloren hätte, und dass es immer deutlicher wurde, dass dieses Mädchen deren Tochter und ich ihr Vater sein könne. Ich wachte eigentlich aus einer solchen Überlegung heraus auf, die wie eine Geschichte war. (134 words)

Ich hatte davon garnichts gewusst und war ziemlich empört. Draussen auf dem Buchdeckel stand mein Name, so dass ich auch als der Autor des Bilderbuches erscheinen musste, und ich war auch auf dem Buchdeckel abgebildet, aber ebenfalls in dem unscharfen Bildstil, so dass man mich eigentlich nicht erkannte. Ich brauchte einige Zeit nach dem Erwachen, bis mir richtig klar wurde, dass es nur ein Traum und kein Grund zur Aufregung sei. (93 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3728 (1995-07-24, 05:00 - Zürich)Wir waren auf dem Weg durch eine fremde Stadt. Unser Ziel lag irgendwo am Rand der Stadt, ein Platz wie ein Messplatz oder ähnliches, wo wir schon mal gewesen waren. Wir fuhren zuerst mit einer Strassenbahn durch eine grosse Strasse in der richtigen Richtung, so dass wir vom Weg noch einen Begriff hatten. Dann bog aber die Strassenbahn ab in ein Gebiet mit kleineren und verwinkelteren Strassen und wir stiegen am Ende dieser Linie aus und hatten nur ein ungefähres Gefühl, wo wir waren. Die Stadt stieg hier auf einem Hügel an. Durch eine Strassenlücke sah ich einen Platz mit alten Häusern mit sehr schönen alten Wänden und strebte dort hin, während Emme, die sich nicht richtig orientiert fühlte in der fremden Stadt, langsam unruhig wurde. Ich wollte noch eine Wand mit einer sehr schönen barocken Gliederung näher betrachten, während Emme jetzt zunächst wissen wollte, wo wir eigentlich waren. Ich entrollte darum einen Stadtplan, den ich bei mir hatte. Jemand anders, der uns auch begleitete und zur Familie gehörte, entdeckte auf dem Stadtplan, dass wir noch ziemlich in der richtigen Richtung waren und zu dem gesuchten Platz am Rande der Stadt entweder durch einen Autobus oder mit der Strassenbahn kommen konnten, die hier beide in der Nähe irgendwo vorbei gingen. Nun wandelte sich die Szene. Wir waren jetzt in einem Haus in einem saalartigen Raum, wo Bilder eins Mädchens ausgestellt waren, das wir kannten, das Malerin und Künstlerin war und die Bilder gemacht hatte. Irgendwie war das wohl aus der Wand geworden, die ich betrachten wollte. Jedes der Bilder sollte zweitausend Mark kosten. Dann war das Mädchen selber da, das mir gefiel und dessen Bilder mir auch gefielen. Es stellte sich dann heraus, dass die zweitausend Mark nur ein Richtpreis waren, den sie immer für ihre Bilder nannte, die sie dann aber doch billiger verkaufte. Sie schien sich auch in der Stadt auszukennen, so dass wir um die Wegfindung nicht mehr besorgt sein mussten. Ich bin dann aufgewacht. Wie waren den Weg von dem Ziel in die Stadt in umgekehrter Richtung auch früher schon einmal gefahren. (346 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3730 (1995-07-26, 04:30 - Zürich)Ich rief in der ETH an. Es meldete sich ein weibliche Stimme und nannte ihren Namen : Blauer. Ich sage: "Hier ist Uslar. Ich möchte gern den Herrn Rektor sprechen, wenn das möglich ist." Sie sagte langgezogen O, um damit zum Ausdruck zu bringen, dass das schwierig und eigentlich unmöglich sei. Ich dachte, dass es besser gewesen wäre, wenn ich mich als Professor gemeldet und nicht nur den Namen gesagt hätte. Ich dachte, dass sie jetzt fragen werde: "Worum geht es?" Ich würde dann sagen müssen: "Um eine Frage des Belegens". Sie würde nicht einsehen, dass man dafür den Rektor sprechen müsse, und versuchen, mich an eine andere Stelle zu verweisen. Wenn ich aber darauf bestehen würde, würde ich vielleicht einen Termin in ganz ferner Zukunft bekommen, was mir nichts nützen würde. Also würde es sicher klüger sein, das Gespräch zu beenden und ein andermal neu anzurufen und "Professor" zu sagen. Es ging irgendwie um die Frage, ob es zu erreichen sei, dass beim Belegen die einzlenen Veranstaltungen differenziert aufgeführt wurden. Das war wichtig. Warum, weiss ich nicht mehr, da ich den Anfang des Traums vergessen habe. Bei diesen Überlegungen zur Fortsetzung des Telephongesprächs, die ganz schnell abliefen, wie Überlegungen, ehe man eine Entscheidung fällt, wachte ich auf. (208 words)

Ich sah die vielen Menschen, die durch die Gänge kamen, hauptsächlich im Gegenlicht, so dass ich die Gesichter nicht erkennen konnte, und hoffte, dass Tina, wenn sie dabei wäre, mich sehen würde, da das Licht ja dann auf mein Gesicht fiel. Bei dem Suchen bin ich dann langsam aufgewacht. (79 words)

Bille hatte sich erboten, das für mich zu tun, und ich bat sie darum. Das Ergebnis war interessant, aber entsprach jetzt zu wenig meinem Stil. Es ging bei den Fragen um sonderbare Phänomene, auch parapsychologischer Art. Sie hatte ein bunte Vielfalt von Phänomenen in die Begründungen gebracht und dabei die Felder sehr dicht ausgefüllt. Ich wollte es darum noch einmal schreiben und etwas übersichtlicher gestalten. Auch war das Farbband, das sie benutzt hatte so, dass eine etwas verschwommene Schrift herausgekommen war. Nun waren aber beide Exemplare des Fragebogens dabei schon verwendet für Originalschrift und Kopie. Ich überlegte, wie ich an neue leere Formulare kommen könne. Dabei erwachte ich. (123 words)

Auf dem Bildschirm hatte alles ganz richtig ausgesehen. Aber, als ich sie ausdruckte, war der Kontrast zwischen Schrift und Hintergrund viel zu schwach und es liefen schräge Streifen diagonal über das Papier. So konnte man die Arbeit unmöglich abgeben und es schien nicht möglich, die Sache bis zum Termin neu zu schreiben. Erst im Erwachen kam mir die Idee, dass es bloss am Drucker liegen könne, und ich überlegte noch während des Aufwachens, was es für Möglichkeiten geben könnte, den Druck doch noch termingerecht in Ordnung zu bringen, weil bei Verpassen des Termins eine ganz lange Wartezeit entstehen würde, bis es wieder möglich wäre, die Arbeit abzugeben.

Ich will gerade sagen, dass die Mode den Geist einer Zeit wiedergibt, habe hier aber doch Bedenken.

Jetzt aber bemerkte ich, dass ich statt der Wolldecke einen Wollmantel von Stini ergriffen hatte, der ebenfalls bei der Garderobe lag, die wir offenbar gemeinsam hatten. Nun führte Emme ein Telephongespräch darüber mit einem Mann, der bei Stini in der Wohnung war. Mir war es vor allem wichtig, dass ich meinen wollenen Dufflecoat, den ich täglich trug - dieser war es nun, statt der Wolldecke, um den es ging - so schnell wie möglich wiederbekam. Der Mann aber hatte angefangen, den Mantel angeblich in Ordnung zu bringen, einen Knopf anzunähen und ähnliches. Ich befürchtete nun, dass er dabei etwas kaputt machen könnte, zum Beispiel die Knebel des Dufflecoat durch Knöpfe ersetzten, oder ähnliches. Ich sagte Emme, sie solle ihm sagen, dass ich den Mantel so schnell wie möglich wiederbrauche und er ihn deshalb irgendwo bereitlegen solle. Emme reagierte aber nicht auf meine Zurufe, vielleicht, weil sie dachte, dass der Mann solche Anweisungen nicht richtig begreifen werde. Ich erwachte wegen des Mantels seht beunruhigt. (182 words)

Aber es ist ein echtes Geschehen, das stehen bleibt. Ich bin jedesmal in einer anderen Rolle daran beteiligt, die Situation zu analysieren. Aber man kann nichts machen, denn es geschieht ja nichts. Aber jedesmal - es ist im Grunde immer die selbe Situation mit den selben Leuten - passiert nichts, das heisst die Gefahr tritt nicht ein und irgendwann läuft das angehaltene Geschehen wieder weiter.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3744 (1995-08-07, 07:00 - Zürich)Es war Mode geworden, dass Jugendliche, um die Strassenbahn zu behindern, sich vor die einfahrenden Bahnen an den Haltestellen mit einem Fussball in der Hand zwischen die Schienen stellten, meist dann aber im letzten Moment zur Seite sprangen. Oder sie legten ihren Fussball, manchmal in einem Netz, vor die einfahrenden Züge. Ich erlebte gerade, wie der Fahrer des Wagens, in dem ich vorne sass, ganz langsam auf einen solchen Sack zu fuhr, leicht bremste und dann ganz vorsichtig darüber weg fuhr. Offenbar befürchtete man, dass auch Sprengstoffanschläge hinter solchen Dingen versteckt sein könnten. Im Erwachen kam mir in den Sinn, dass man etwas dagegen unternehmen müsse, es aber schwer sei, die richtige juristische Form dafür zu finden. Der Tatbestand. "Behinderung des öffentlichen Verkehrs" kam mir dabei im Erwachen in den Sinn. (131 words)

Es war gerade ein schweres Gewitter über Berlin, das man von der Stadt abwenden musste. Ich war gerade beim Baden in einem Haus ausserhalb der Stadt. So lief ich noch nackt mit dem weissen Badehandtuch hinaus und breitete es aus, damit der Blitz ausserhalb der Stadt einschlug. Ich war aber nicht ganz sicher, ob er nicht stattdessen direkt in das Handtuch einschlagen und mich treffen könne, was aber nicht geschah. (112 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3748 (1995-08-11, 01:00 - Zürich)Ich wohnte in einem Art Gutshaus, wo viele Gäste waren, unter ihnen auch eine alte Frau, die sehr anspruchsvoll war und von allen Leuten immer bedient werden wollte. Eines Morgens hatte ich es sehr eilig und lief durch das Haus, um mir Sachen für das Frühstück zusammen zu suchen. Da sass sie schon in einem der Räume, durch die ich dabei laufen musste, und rief: "Bringt mir denn niemand Frühstück?", als sie mich sah. Da ich wirklich keine Zeit hatte und sie sehr verwöhnt war, rief ich einfach ohne Begründung: "Nein". Sie war erstaunt und rief: "Kümmert sich denn niemand um mich?". Ich rief wieder ebenso munter zurück: "Nein". Über diese ungewohnte Direktheit, die sie gar nicht gewohnt war, war sie so erstaunt, dass sie verstummte, und ich konnte mir ungestört etwas für mein eiliges Frühstück zusammen suchen, darunter Brot und ein Besteck, und Kuchen, den ich fand. Ich war froh, dass ich so direkt geantwortet hatte und nun ungestört und ohne zu schleichen, an ihr vorbei gehen konnte, denn die Zeit war wirklich schon sehr knapp und der Termin wichtig. Dann wachte ich auf und begriff zuerst garnicht, dass das ein Traum gewesen war. (195 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3749 (1995-08-12, 23:30 - Zürich)Ich ging durch den Wald spazieren auf einem jener schmalen Pfade, die in Freiburg Holzwege heissen, weil einzelne Baumstämme da durchgeschleift werden können. Auf einmal kamen Russen, die die Gegend besetzt hielten, quer durch den Wald mit ihren Pferden, die irgendetwas hinter sich herzogen, und schütteten dabei den Holzweg, als sie ihn überquerten, zu. Als ich ihn noch nachdenklich und betrübt betrachtete, kam ein russischer General, der empört war über das, was seine Leute gemacht hatten, und ihnen befahl, sofort den Weg wieder frei zu legen. Diese kamen nun mit einem einzelnen Pferd, das etwas hinter sich her schleifte, um den Weg damit entlang zu gehen und ihn frei zu legen. Das machten sie aber so ungestüm und ungeschickt, dass sie dabei den ganzen Weg der Länge nach zuschütteten. Da kam wieder ein anderer russischer Offizier, der sehr empört war über dieses Ungeschick und seinen Leuten befahl, sofort den Weg richtig frei zu legen. Das taten sie mit einem Gespann und einem grossen Schleifinstrument, das sie hinter sich herzogen. Dabei entstand ein breiter leer geschlagener Fahrweg, der aber nun gar kein Holzweg mehr war, wie der, den ich nachdenklich entlang gegangen war, sondern ein richtiger langweiliger Fahrweg. Als ich nun darüber nachdachte, wachte ich auf. Die Reihenfolge dieser einzelnen Handlungen und Geschehnisse war in Traum sehr schnell hintereinander gekommen und sie waren dabei fast unmerklich ineinander übergegangen. (227 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3750 (1995-08-12, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte in der Wohnung eine Badeanlage, die aus einer Reihe von hintereinander aufgestellten Wannen bestand, die mit verschieden warmem Wasser gefüllt waren. Wenn man es wärmer oder kälter haben wollte, ging man einfach in die jeweils nächste Wanne. Es gab in dem Zimmer kein fliessend Wasser. Eine andere Szene war vorhergegangen, wo ich im Zimmer eine einzelne Sitzwanne hatte, die auf einem Gestell erhöht aufgestellt war. Ich wollte sie zunächst herunternehmen und direkt auf den Boden stellen, merkte dann aber, dass das Gestell zugleich dazu diente, die ausgestreckten Füsse abzulegen, denn die Wanne war nicht ganz so lang wie der Körper, wenn man die Beine ausstreckte. Es war wohl eigentlich eine Babybadewanne, aber sehr bequem. (116 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3751 (1995-08-13, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte an einem Mittwoch eine Sprechstunde mit einer Art von Patienten, die ich behandeln musste. Aber ich war nicht richtig vorbereitet und die Zeit verging, und plötzlich war es zu spät, um noch rechtzeitig dorthin zu kommen, denn die Sprechstunde fand in einem anderen Haus statt. Ein Mädchen, mit dem ich irgendwie zu tun hatte, wie mit einer Sekretärin, riet mir, doch die Sprechstunde einfach abzusagen und erst einmal in Ruhe alles zu lesen, was dafür nötig war, und die Sache in Ruhe vorzubereiten. Das war der richtige Vorschlag, der wieder Gleichgewicht in die Situation brachte, und ich war sehr beruhigt. Später erzählte ich noch jemand anderem von diesem klugen Ratschlag, den das Mädchen gegeben hatte, das während dieser Erzählung aber dabei war, so dass ich während der Rede Zweifel bekam, ob es eigentlich richtig war, das in ihrer Gegenwart zu erzählen, aber ich sagte mir, dass es ja ein Lob für sie war.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3752 (1995-08-15, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich war umhergegangen, unter anderem auch in einer Kirche, die ich besichtigt hatte, und muss dabei meine Handtasche irgendwo haben stehen lassen. Jetzt war ich in einem Verkaufsstand und wollte ein belegtes Brötchen kaufen. Ich suchte ein kleines aus, dass man bequem essen konnte, und die Verkäuferin sagte, dass es 6.50 koste, was auch darauf stand, merkte dann aber selbst, dass das nicht stimmen könnte, und sagte: "Ich gebe es Ihnen für 65 Pfennig". Ich sagte, dass jemand beim Schreiben des Preises, offenbar das Komma falsch gesetzt habe. Nun reichte sie mir aber ein anderes, viel zu umfangreiches Brötchen, dass man nur mühsam essen konnte. Ich gab es zurück und sagte, dass es mir leid täte, aber ich hätte doch ein ganz kleines ausgesucht. Dies liess sich aber jetzt nicht mehr finden. Da die Verkäuferin gerade selbst eines ass, nahm ich an, dass sie es genommen hätte, und suchte nun eine anderes kleines spitzes aus, das offenbar mit Schinken belegt war. Sie konnte es von ihrer Innenseite des Standes aus nur schwer finden, obwohl ich es ihr zeigte, und gab mir schliesslich eines, das offenbar mit einer Art von Salat belegt war. Ich nahm es und sagte nichts, weil es sonst zu kompliziert geworden wäre. Auch wurde mir jetzt bewusst, dass ich zurückgehen und die Handtasche suchen müsste. Erwachen mit Kopfweh und leichtem Hungergefühl (224 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3753 (1995-08-16, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich war in einem Raum, der für die Hauswarte der Universität da war und in dem verschiedene Hauswarte, unter ihnen auch der sehr väterliche Chefhauswart der Universität, Herr Lienhard, versammelt waren. Aus einem Nebenraum hörte man ein leise heulendes Geräusch. Es war sein Hund, der dort gewartet hatte und nun herausgelassen wurde. Er kam gleich begeistert auf mich zu gelaufen. Ich hielt gleichsam reflexartig meine alte lederne Kollegmappe, die ich bei mir hatte, vor mich, für den Fall, dass er nach mir schnappen würde. Er wedelte aber und begann meine Hand zu lecken, und ich streichelte ihn. Ich hatte ein paar neue kleine Schlüssel abgeholt, die man dort für mich gemacht hatte. In einer offenstehenden Schublade sah ich die alten, die für mich mit Erinnerungen verbunden waren. Ich nahm sie darum heraus und fragte einen anderen, etwas jüngeren Hauswart, ob ich sie haben könne. Er bejahte dies, nahm sie aber von dem Ring, an dem sie hingen, der auch von mir stammte. Ich dachte, er meinte vielleicht, dass es der Ring sei, den ich haben wolle, und sagte deshalb, dass es aber die Schlüssel selber seien, die ich haben möchte. Er sagte, dass er das wisse. Ich sagte, warum er sie denn nicht einfach an dem Ring, der alt war, dran lasse. Er antwortete, sozusagen im Scherz: "Weil man eine Arbeit, die man angefangen hat, zu Ende machen muss". Schliesslich hatte er es fertig gebracht, sie von dem Schlüsselring zu lösen, und gab sie mir Wir sprachen dann noch ein paar Worte über die neuen Schlüssel, die bequemer und gängiger waren als die alten. Es war eine sehr freundliche und vertraute Atmosphäre in dem Raum und ich erwachte entspannt und befriedigt. (281 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3755 (1995-08-18, 06:30 - Zürich)Lange Korridore, in denen ich auf und ab gehe, zum Teil auch mit Reinigungsgeräten. Vorher andere Szene, oder anderer Traum, wo jemand, eine Frau, ein Fluggerät hat, auf dem man gleichsam reitend sitzt. Auch die Kinder haben schon darauf Platz genommen. Ich sitze hinter der Frau und habe einen Mantel bei mir, den ich anziehe, weil es in der Luft im Fluge wohl kühl werden wird. Ehe wir starten, küsse ich die Frau. Das Gerät hatte einen langen, organisch geschwungenen Rumpf, auf dem alle bequem hintereinander sitzen konnten. Es war weiss und hatte vorne weisse Flügel in ebenfalls organisch wirkenden Formen.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3757 (1995-08-19, 07:00 - Zürich)Es ging um Holzoberflächen verschiedener Art auf Tischen und Holzuntersätzen, die wir zum Teil hatten, zum Teil in einem Geschäft gesehen hatten und vielleicht kaufen wollten. Vor allem Tina und Emme und ich waren daran beteiligt. Es waren aber auch andere Familienmitglieder da. Ein Brett hatte eine sehr schöne Oberfläche, wo sich Rippen härteren Holzes leicht plastisch aus der übrigen Fläche abhoben. Das Brett war aber ziemlich teuer und wir hatten deshalb gezögert, es zu kaufen. Dann hatte aber Tina das getan und es in ihrer Handtasche einfach mitgenommen. Ich suchte auch einen kleinen Untersatz, wohl für ein Glas, und einer, der dafür geeignet schien, stellte sich aber als Gurkenscheibe heraus und war natürlich nicht fest genung. Ich sagte dann, es müsse etwas mit einer glatten Oberfläche sein, wie das Holz der Tische, an denen wir sassen. Ich erwachte dann mit einem angenehmen Gefühl des schönen Materials. (147 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3758 (1995-08-20, 01:00 - Zürich)Ich fuhr in Freiburg mit der Strassenbahn an dem Eckhaus zur Schwarzwaldstrasse neben der Schwabentorbrücke vorbei, in dem die Praxis von Rosset gewesen war. Die Strassenbahn fuhr so dicht an dem Haus vorbei, dass man in der Mauer eine Fülle von alten Inschriften lesen konnte, die alle ausgelöscht waren aber noch als Vertiefungen erkennbar, weil sie eingemeisselt gewesen waren. Es waren Aufschriften von Leuten, die in dem Haus praktiziert hatten, als Rechtsanwälte und anderes. Es waren ihre Firmenschilder gewesen. Eine Inschrift handlete auch von einem Mann namens Haag, der als Wohltäter bezeichnet wurde. Aber die Inschrift von Rosset war nicht dabei, obwohl er doch so lange in dem Haus als Arzt praktiziert hatte und vor ihm schon sein Vater. Zwei Frauen, die auch in der Strassenbahn sassen und ebenfalls im Vorbeifahren die Inschriften entzifferten, sagten im Gespräch miteinander, dass Rosset in einer Klinik läge, wohl wegen irgendeiner Krankheit, und sich ärgere, dass seine Inschrift nicht zugelassen sei.

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3759 (1995-08-22, 02:15 - Zürich)Ich war in London. Es gab dort auch zweistöckige Autobusse, die nicht grösser waren als ein Personenauto. Solche verkehrten auf der Linie, die ich benutzte und die eigentlich dem Weg vom Klusplatz hier in Zürich in die Stadt glich. Ich hatte gerade einen solchen Bus verpasst und sah nun einen anderen startbereit in einer Seitenstrasse, aber noch nicht an der offiziellen Haltestelle stehen. Ich fragte von aussen den Fahrer, ob ich einsteigen und nach oben gehen dürfe. Er antwortete, ob ich denn nicht die Zeitung gelesen habe und von dem Dienstmädchen, das auf einem solchen Bus umgekommen sei. Ich dachte er mache einen Witz, und fragte noch mal, ob ich einsteigen und nach oben gehen dürfe. Er nickte und ich ging hinauf. Oben lag auf den Sitzen ein dicke Schicht Schnee. Ich wunderte mich und wischte sie zur Seite und setzte mich. Jetzt hörte ich, dass das Mädchen, das im Bus gefahren war, an einer Lungenentzündung gestorben war. Jetzt erst bemerkte ich, dass der Oberstock dieses Kleinbusses gar kein Dach und keine Seitenwände hatte, weswegen auch der Schnee auf die Sitze fallen konnte. Es wurde mir klar, dass es im Fahrtwind hier sehr kalt werden und ich mich vielleicht erkälten würde. Aber nachdem ich so eindringlich gefragt hatte, genierte ich mich, jetzt wieder herunter zu gehen. Allmählich siegte aber die Einsicht, dass das doch nötig war und ich sagte etwas Entschuldigendes zum Fahrer und stieg wieder aus. Dann erwachte ich und bemerkte, dass es kalt zur offenstehenden Balkontür hereinkam und ich fror und eine zweite Wolldecke benötigte. (257 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3760 (1995-08-22, 07:00 - Zürich)Bille hatte eine Geschichte geschrieben. Darin kam eine Wohnung am Rande der Stadt vor, die die Heldin benutzen konnte. Aber einmal war es ein kleine Wohnung mit kleinen Räumen, ein ander mal eine eher geräumige ehemalige Werkstatt. In beiden spielten sehr schön dargestellte wichtige Szenen. Dieser Widerspruch fiel mir auf und ich dachte darüber nach. Ich kam darauf, dass man diesen Widerspruch leicht beseitigen konnte, wenn man es als eine Wohnung mit einer dabei liegenden Werkstatt bezeichnete. Es war nur nötig, das Geschlecht eines kleinen Kindes, mit dem sie einmal in die Wohnung fuhr, zu ändern. Es musste statt eines kleinen Sohnes ein kleines Mädchen sein, weil dann die einzelnen Geschichten richtig zueinander passten. Ich überlegte, ob ich ihr das vorschlagen sollte, weil dann die geschriebene Geschichte praktisch fertig war. Ich tat es und sie war sehr angetan von dieser Lösung und wollte es so machen.

Ich wollte auch ein Bad in einem grossen Badezimmer nehmen, musste aber erst Leute aus dem Raum herausdrängen, um die Tür abschliessen zu können. Dort war auch ein altes Mikrophon, das man aus dem Fenster schieben und dadurch die Geräusche der Strasse und die Stimmen der Vorbeigehenden aufnehmen und in den Raum bringen konnte. Ich zeigte dies irgend jemand. (82 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3762 (1995-08-25, 06:00 - Zürich)Ich hatte einen weiten Weg zurück zu legen in einem Rollstuhl zwischen einer Wohnung und einem Schwimmbad und zurück in einer unbekannten Stadt, in der ich mich nicht auskannte. Einmal hatte ich den Rollstuhl in dem Schwimmbad vergessen und war statt dessen mit dem Fahrrad gefahren. Dabei ging es eine sehr lange, sehr steile Strasse bergab, auf der die Geschwindigkeit mit dem rollenden Rad immer grösser wurde, so dass es mühsam wurde, genügend zu bremsen. Offenbar war ich auf einen anderen Weg geraten als den, den ich sonst benutzt hatte. Ich musste ein Karte zu Rate ziehen, um richtig zu der Wohnung zurück zu kommen. Ich hatte den Rollstuhl zwar gebraucht, war aber nicht ernstlich behindert gewesen. Das sagte ich auch, als eine hilfsbereite Frau am Eingang des Schwimmbades mir einmal den Stuhl schieben helfen wollte. (136 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3765 (1995-08-28, 00:10 - Zürich)Ich ging mit jemand durch eine Naturlandschaft und plötzlich kamen wir an einer ganzen Reihe von Löwen vorbei. Es gab keine Möglichkeit des Ausweichens und die Löwen standen unmittelbar neben uns, so dass wir an einem nach dem anderen ganz dicht entlang gehen mussten. Ich versuchte, möglichst natürlich zu tun, und redete mit einer möglichst hohen Stimme beruhigend auf sie ein. Wir kamen an allen heil vorbei und an eine Hecke mit einem Zaun, der eine Lücke hatte, durch die wir hindurch konnten. Hier schienen wir in Sicherheit zu sein, aber es war mir klar, dass die Löwen durch das selbe Loch auch hindurch konnten. Am besten würde es sein, wenn wir irgendwo ein Haus mit festen Türen finden würden. Bei dieser Überlegung erwachte ich. (125 words)

Allmählich stieg das Wasser auch in dem Haus, in dem wir waren, empor, und schliesslich waren auch schon die Möbel im Wasser und unsere Füsse und es stieg immer noch weiter. Wir waren aber guter Dinge und nahmen an, dass es aufhören würde. Dann bin ich erwacht. Es war noch eine Szene vorausgegangen, die am Schweriner See spielte . Da war ein Mann, der Forschungen über diese Landschaft trieb. Ich fragte ihn, ob er auch die Grosse und die Kleine Karausche kenne, zwei versteckt liegende Gewässer in der Uferlandschaft hinter unserem Haus, die mich als Kind faszinierten. Aber er kannte sie nicht. Dann kam die Szene mit der Überschwemmung. (124 words)

Ich drückte, noch verschlafen, den Türöffner und rief zugleich Emme etwas zu. Es kam aber nur ein Zeitungsausträger die Treppe rauf, der nicht speziell zu uns wollte. Bei dieser Gelegenheit sah ich, die Treppe herabblickend, dass ich das Haus noch garnicht richtig erforscht hatte. Ich blickte in der Etage unter uns am Fusse der alten Holztreppe in einen geräumigen Flur mit vielen Türen, in dem auch einzelne Möbel standen und Leute hin und her gingen. An der Wand in unserer Wohnung entdeckte ich noch alte handgeschriebene Schilder von Vorbewohnern, auf denen Namen standen und daneben "einmal klingeln", "zweimal klingeln," und so weiter. Überhaupt trug das Innere dieses alten Hauses viele Spuren vergangener Zeiten und die alte relativ breite Holztreppe hatte vom vielen Gehen in langen Jahren ausgetretene Stufen. Das Haus hatte einen gemütlichen und bergenden und zugleich zum Erforschen auffordernden Charakter. (153 words)

Detlev von Uslar, auf Deutsch:#3768 (1995-08-30, 06:15 - Zürich)Ich war bei einem Fest in einer psychiatrischen Klinik. Wir sassen an einem Tisch beim Essen. Die anderen waren alle Ärzte. Es gab eine Art Kuchenbrot, das in Formen von menschlichen Köpfen gebacken war, die berühmte Gestalten, wie etwa Einstein oder ähnliche, darstellten. Wir hatten einen solchen, der schon angeschnitten war. Es war aber auch das fehlende Stück noch da, und wir könnten uns es geben lassen. Emme fand das aber unnötig, weil wir so viel Brot garnicht brauchten. Ich fand dagegen gut, es zu haben, damit der Kopf vollständig sei. Wir stellten fest, dass alle Patienten Nummern hatten, die aber nicht eine Folge bildeten, sondern in unregelmässiger Folge gegeben zu werden schienen. Einige waren zweistellig, andere dreistellig. Ich sagte zu meinem Gesprächspartner, dass sie vielleicht einen Hinweis auf die Diagnose
