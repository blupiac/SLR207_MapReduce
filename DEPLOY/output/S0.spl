The one at the Meads's house, where it's bigger inside than out; there's a European village just inside, with a cobblestone street and a Pied-Piper sort of man with curly hair, he can do things like juggle - I go up the back stairs [there aren't any in the real house] and then down the other side [since there's a second set, immediately] then down a short empty hallway that turns a corner, where I find a tiny room...a young woman with shoulder-length blonde hair in a pageboy is there, cooking at a stove that almost fills the room...she's nice to me. Now outside, I'm waiting for my aunt to pick me up - she arrives in a little round convertible and we go for a drive, not very far - we cross a little bridge over a creek, then double back and she drops me off at the house again. Inside (?) I sit with a couple of people, playing with a string of blue balloons. (154 words)

I'm at a family reunion in a large fine house with grounds (or a maybe a rented public building like in a park) - maybe it's granite or something, very imposing. I'm on a little round balcony with a few others (I think men), there are lots more people inside. I feel faint and collapse. They see that I'm very sick, and quickly take me to a car to go to the hospital. (I don't see any of that, the next I know is that I'm lying in the back seat of the car - a sedan - going like gangbusters on a huge freeway. It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical. The cars are not stopping or even slowing down, and they whoosh straight up. They make it about halfway up on momentum, and then gravity takes over and they fall down. I can see them sort of drop off [rather than sliding down still in contact with the pavement] and fall down way below me. (248 words)

I watch a plane fly past and shortly realize it was too low. It crashes not half a block away (rather as though it fell from a height of a few yards than flying straight into the ground). and I think there might be survivors, and that I should call the police. Before I get the number dialed, I realize I want the fire department instead. I get no ring, try again and find the line is dead. Some people (3? - at least one a woman) are coming toward the house and I understand they are responsible for the dead phone and I should be suspicious of them. I try to leave the house - run into a pregnant girl at the back; she seems to be in some sort of a bad way and has maybe started labor. The woman from the plane comes this way, calls the others to come get the pregnant girl, and I pretend to be asleep or dead. They don't buy it, I guess, and we all go inside. 
       I'm not a prisoner, I don't think, so much as being detained for some reason, and I go to my brother's old room. He moved out of it a couple of years ago but there is furniture still there and I haven't looked around in a long time. [This does not seem to be the family home - I felt like it was rented.] There are a couple of chests of drawers that I realize I could have used downstairs long ago, yet I've been looking for acceptable furniture all this time. Also there are blankets (as well as clothes and shoes - women's shoes - but they aren't important), a lot of blankets, and I badly needed those last winter but didn't realize they were here. Also a very nice shoe rack. The woman comes back to say or do something. [I don't know what, and the dream ended about there, I think.] (303 words)

Me pulling the green leaves and berries off some branches or a bush (not from a live one growing in the ground, but inside the house). A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, "Mother's asleep" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of "us" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad. (468 words)

I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, "I need you". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it.

Living next door to Loretta in an apartment - looks as if we just moved in or were just moving out. I'm in her place, and aware that the door is open to my place and anyone could walk in and steal things. (It's also as though there's no front wall at all - and this is upstairs, not inside the building but facing outside, we're at the end of the walkway and the stairs are at the other end so anyone coming would pass my place first). Don't know what's happening, but there's a group of people involved. At least 3 of us stop at a grocery store on our way somewhere - an outing of some sort, like a picnic or an amusement park. The 3rd person is a woman I don't recognize, but she's friendly and energetic - I think she has a kid - this is her store and she knows what we're looking for. It's the sort of place you don't see much anymore - leftover from the Fifties and Sixties. Funny lighting. Also a brief image of going high on an overpass in an open car - don't know who's driving - blue skies, sunlight - there's something beside the overpass that we mean to grab at but it's not easy to reach and we think it's best not to try.

Kidnapped - I'm on my way somewhere else (by car?) and stop to visit with some people I know - seems like a few houses or buildings together, maybe like a small village out in the country somewhere. Some people with guns turn up, rather like political terrorists, and they're going to keep us prisoner until something, but I don't know what. I grouse about it and use the word "kidnapped" and they think it rather an affront that I would use the word - hurt their feelings. I'm rather in two minds about trying to escape - I think it's the right thing to do but I'm not sure because I find I don't trust these people not to shoot me (!) or the others not to botch the job. In the end, one of them gives me an opportunity - I kind of think voluntarily - and I run. Somebody chases me, but I keep on running - stop once and look around, decide to keep running just in case. They give up fairly soon. Later I go back, after they've been caught - I don't know if that was my doing or not - and there was some problem with punishing them. I'm real mad because I don't think they're being dealt with harshly enough. My friends try to talk to me, make me see that they aren't such bad guys as I made them out to be, and I won't listen. (And they aren't - they didn't hurt anybody, or get nasty. My biggest problem was being so angry at the insult to my freedom, that anyone would think he or she had any right to interfere with it for any reason.) (286 words)

I'm alone in an apartment - old place, inside the building - it's dark, maybe I've gone to bed - somebody breaks in, there's at least 2 of them and they come towards my room, being quiet, they don't know I'm here. I can't lock the door (or maybe it makes too much noise) but I try to hold the door shut so they'll think it is. Doesn't work. A guy with a knife comes in - black, looks the part of a bad guy, leather jacket, nasty expression. Waves the knife. I say, "you don't need that knife" and he says something like, "Oh, so I don't need the knife, huh?" - sneering-like, and feints it at my face. I am very aware there's nothing I can do to help myself and I'm afraid but stand still. He pushes the knife at me again and I grab his wrist and he sort of turns the knife upward to cut my wrist with it - I'm aware that even if I can kick him I'm probably going to die or get hurt.

I'm somewhere with a friend I don't want to be around much and going back to her house and then elsewhere on errands. She asks me to take something with me to return to the library. At her house I see her mother and stepfather. (Rather young and both attractive.) They're both in a hurry to get somewhere too, rushing about. I seem to want to stay, or I want something from them, and am reluctant to go out the door - but I do, and stick my head back in several times with one last question. Then I remember the library - the things to take back are very large magazines ("American Baby"?) And even have "return to Marty" written on the front - Marty is the mother - so I say to her, "don't you work right by the library?" and she says yes, she'll take them for me, so that was nice. I can almost remember where she worked, someplace like an aerospace or computer office, standard modern waiting room, light colors, plants, etc. (177 words)

I am in some public place, reminds me of the grocery store in another dream, or lots of airports - there is food involved, and for some reason or other people are eating in the restroom. (This isn't normal.) I'm sitting at the mirror-counter next to a man, and am very ill at ease about it. There's no actual reason for it, it's entirely the principle of the thing. (69 words)

At a school - I don't think I actually go to it but I'm with somebody else; it's real close to the end of the year and everybody has a what-the-hell attitude. We're in a big open room without chairs to see a film (educational, of course) and my friend parks beside a big obnoxious-looking woman (also not a standard-issue school student) but I don't relish the idea so I pick another spot and my friend joins me. The film rolls and it involves sport or dancing, and a couple of kids get up to demonstrate something which involves vigorous movement, and they "dance" right outside to the open grass and air - a spot rather like one at Scarb Faire. I seem to have come along for the ride, as has somebody from the class who's supposed to be getting them back in the classroom and doesn't really care any more than they do. The routine is something like, "well I looked but I didn't find them" and everybody goes their merry way. (174 words)

Me and MB (one of my cats) in a big fancy dark-colored van - going to some kind of a show. She was in a cage to go there but came out for it - don't know what happened at (like an auditorium?) but we came back to the van. I put her in the driver's side door and went around to the other. Then I fiddled with the door a long time. It was a double swing door, and I hadn't known about this one inside latch about 2/3 up the door - black switch - that latched the side without a handle by itself. I tried several different things to see what it did, then when I got the whole thing shut up it was real dark inside and everything was real awkward. MB went back in her cage and we started off, but I was having some trouble handling the van. We were going along a dirt road on the grounds of the auditorium, joining a line of cars to get to some place like a campground for another event. We weren't gonna stay but I wanted to do something there. We were behind a guy with dark hair and a blonde older woman in a convertible and the guy first looks startled, then nervous, then annoyed at the van. Keeps looking around at us and I wondered what I was doing wrong. I figured I was driving the van backwards at first and looked out for a place I could turn around, but then I realized I wasn't backward, but I was on the passenger side driving with an auxiliary steering wheel. Would've been difficult to change but I figured I was managing all right anyway, so I went on. When we were entering the campground, something happened to the guy in front of us. He's now in a hole in the middle of the road, like up to his shoulders, and he's bitching at a rabbit, who's come up to look at him. He has to duck down for cars to go over the road, rabbit runs off, we go to a place where the road circles around at its end and people have parked. Bit of a hill it's on. Concrete or stone toilet-building like they have in parks. I swing the van around this tight little circle looking for an empty space and there really isn't one, but the swinging around is something of a challenge and apparently it made an impression because some people clapped. I did stop the van in a place that I figured I couldn't leave it but I just wanted to ask somebody the price of cattle. Somebody told me $31 a head and I wanted to explain that I meant a sort of middle-range rather than the best, or real cheap. (474 words)

I arrive at a little frame house on a nice little residential street, in a car in the company of a couple of older women. It's been raining and might rain again. It's dark but not necessarily night. We go into the house, which belongs to another nice little old lady. We have an errand there and ought to get back somewhere pretty soon. Seems to me we're all a trifle edgy about something, but not all of us know what about. Like the lady of the house here - she knows something's not right, but isn't asking for explanation.

I'm in my own apartment by myself and have to go outside for something - it's in an apartment complex more typical of the old place on N Street - regular white box. It's dark and gray and rainy outside, and I'm not anxious to get wet, but I have to do this - maybe while it's not raining hard but only dripping I can get out and back again. There isn't anybody around and I'm kind of apprehensive about it - the place is not exactly cheerful and gay on a good day, but now it's almost sinister. I'm blocked by the gutter runoffs to get into my apartment, and I don't much fancy trying to go round the long way. I wait for it to slack off so I can duck it, but I get pretty wet anyway. The door of my apartment is standing open (I didn't go far), and somehow I've got an idea there's somebody in here. I haven't seen a soul around and I wasn't out of sight of the door for very long but I've got this feeling anyway. I pause at the door and stick my head inside, looking around. (There really isn't any furniture in here to speak of - it looks a lot like I've just moved in, or maybe I'm getting ready to move out but I don't think so.) I think I call out - suppose it would be "Is anybody here?" And there's silence for a bit, then my cousin comes out of the hallway. (He looks healthier than usual - an enhanced my cousin, clearer, rounder, more cheerful and easy.) He's come to visit and I was expecting him but didn't know when - he's glad to see me and I'm relieved but still a bit paranoid. (301 words)

I'm in a little store with another woman and maybe a kid - looks like an antique store but has other things, including odd-looking Christmas ornaments. I'm admiring some of them - also the others find some bubble-pack things, toys that are from a film whose name they can't place, but I'm familiar with it - takes me a minute to get it right and then there's another related set nearby that's from another movie I recall right away - they're both like children's science-fiction, and English, which is why I know them and the others don't. There is some element of this all being a bit strange. (108 words)

I am with a lot of LT people, at something like a talk - a church service - don't know. Ben is there and he kisses me the way he usually does and asks me to go out with him - not just for one date, for fun, but sort of like a trial going steady. I say it may be okay, but I want to think about it and talk to Sue S.. I don't actually do that, but I do see Sue sometime else in the dream, she's sitting in the "audience" sort of place and there's a very loose sort of atmosphere where we are, as though it were an ongoing class and you can divert your attention from it to talk to people - very much as the Training is, but not physically set up that way and we're not actually doing anything but looking on.

At work (?) was on the elevator with an older woman who wasn't sure what floor she wanted so she pushed extra buttons - I'd already gone up when I meant to go down to 2, and wasn't thrilled at having to stop so much. So I got off (she was surprised I took exception) and found myself outside, sort of, and now I have to get in a car that goes somewhere down some streets like in Oak town - the car was like an old '50s sort of thing with fins and they were coming off and needed to be stuck back down, took a while - arrived at a place that was an "elevator stop", nice old tree-lined street, the door didn't face the street - it was ivy-covered stone, very nice. Inside it was cave-like and open, but there was the elevator door. There was somebody there as well as 2 cats, and I made some comment about them having kittens (like it would be a good idea) and the guy said they were both males or something and I felt the same sort of cuteness about the exchange you usually do talking about kitties. I think I got on the elevator, and when I got to the next place I was talking to Margaret Laurence, who was enthusiastic about my intentions to do something or other, and the conversation was interrupted by Pam , who came to say the same sort of thing - they talked together for a minute before I stopped them, then they took turns.

Bonnie came to see if I needed anything and just poked around before going to work - later I went to Bluebonnet and was looking at things like a perfume ("White Oak"?) that I couldn't smell and other such things when I realized I just came straight on without a shower or anything and I must look awful. I went round to the back and got out my little mirror - decided I'd manage. While I was deciding, I'd got on a bus in the parking lot, and was halfway down the drive before I realized I'd better get off, my car was here at the store. Somewhere I run into Dad and My stepmother, who I carried on a casual conversation with and we went on to walk home together. (I wasn't living with them, but it was on the way.) There wasn't much conversation, and My stepmother walked on ahead. I fell into a daydream about a quiz show kind of like the one I'd seen yesterday, "Chance of a Lifetime" - only it was more like something I'd seen in England and it was the sort where you had to decide if you were coming back the next day to win more. I daydreamed it was me playing and planning to go for it all when I came awake and saw that My stepmother was nowhere in sight. Dad wasn't concerned, he said she'd probably gone by to see about "the boys" - who I took to mean my brother and male cousin, living together as roommates. We cut through somebody's yard and across the corner of a yard and a porch. I knew we were in Oak town and recognized the kind of little semi-shabby house, but kind of envied it and the little apartment house we passed - one window had something hanging in it that I noticed. Wherever the place was, they weren't home, and we went on (I was aware of it being a very long walk) past where Grandmom used to live [which is not in Oak town]. We stopped - for a rest? - next to the house, just where you couldn't see it, facing the railroad track. Dad leaned against (a car?) and talked a little, as if to himself, about how he wished things were different - with him and My stepmother, with the family - and he looked sad and dejected. I started to tell him he could have it different, maybe for both of them, maybe just for him, and almost got to tell him about LT when I woke up - I'd said I was going to a psychotherapist and that was good, but what really made the difference was...

I'm going down a walkway between little, close-set houses looking for something and pretending I'm in a detective story, sneaking around and prepared for anything - I jump at a sound and dive into a convenient garage, flipping over and springing into position behind something for cover. Ironically, the door starts to close - slides sideways. The person doing it peeks in for a second. I recognize him (somebody from TV). I jump up to let him know I'm there and make excuse that I just stepped in to wipe dust off me or something. He lets me out and I sheepishly go on. At the end of the street there's sort of a shopping center with a Sanger's and I remember the bra sale. I run into Bill Wilding, who's waiting for me and asks me to take something with me to hand over to somebody I'm going to see. It's a bunch of what looks like hairpins, only not black. We drop some when he's handing them to me and I stoop to help pick them up. I'm a bit annoyed that he expects me to do this. We are next to another person but I don't know who. I continue to a house or apartment where there are some people waiting for me, we're preparing for something and there's a task to be performed right now. My mother is there, I think, or somebody I feel that way about - maybe 3 couples and an extra man, who's friendly and pats me on the butt, which I hate and almost yell at him but not quite and I say to myself next time I will. I think the others know and they think he's a creep too. When I realize what we've got to do I'm very disappointed because I was expecting to get dinner - I haven't had much to eat all day - my mind flashes back to one of my male cousins skimpy breakfasts*, and I haven't had anything to speak of since. I am really let down and whiny. [Dream ends there, I think - but I also think it didn't begin there, there was more before.] (346 words)

I'm trying to find the original plans or instructions to something and having no luck. There's a large "file"-thing with shelves that rotate individually along the lines of the one at work but on a horizontal axis instead of vertical. I'm turning each shelf carefully because they all have different things on them but mostly (Mexican?) painted figures on them, even group displays, very nice things too. But no file. Somebody speaks to me, I think (she?) is saying it won't be there, (she's?) going to look elsewhere. I go a few yards away to something or other that's got some things in it I can look through - it makes me think of a bin. I sort of halfheartedly poke at them, then I get a half-formed picture of what I'm looking for, and a new approach - I may have missed it and will go back to look (in the file?). This is all outside, in a kind of courtyard, and there are people around. (167 words)

I was walking home with some little glass figures - some maybe little-fingernail size, others no more than twice that - I had some other things to carry and they were sort of loose on top of what I was carrying up against me, but I wasn't expecting that to stay secure, so as I walked I was transferring the bigger ones to my pocket, the smaller ones (where? coin purse?). Also apprehensive that they'd get broken from being jostled. When I get home I come into a perhaps duplex - it sort of tends to be the left side, or at least the front door is on the far left - anyway, it's a small living room furnished sort of college-student. I take the figures out and look for a place to put them, but just decide to put them with the others, on a very high shelf above the door - some are Christmas things, and I'm figuring you won't be seeing them all the time anyway, that's as good a way to store them as any. One of them, as I take it out and put it on the floor, is broken after all, but I'm not upset, I can glue it - I don't recognize what it's meant to be, it's a sort of wreath base with little wineglass-shapes that stand up on it. It's one of the wineglasses that's broken, but except for a sliver it'll go back together. I'm looking for the sliver (I think I've taken my skirt off by now - got a slip on) when my roommate comes in - she's young, blonde, short hair, pretty, sort of a popular-girl type - we're pretty good friends but not constant companions. We talk, but it's mostly chat and she's starting to take things off, too, when somebody else comes, at least 2, one male, who's maybe her brother or our brotherly other roommate. It's a little disconcerting to be sitting around not entirely clothed but at least we're decent, and they don't stay in that room. (344 words)

Lynn and Jane and I are at a LT function and they have something going on that they're upset about. Won't tell me what it is yet, but we're on our way back from the Training Room to (?) the Team Room, they're both gripy and stuck-acting. Testy. We're in a place that's bound to be a shopping mall, open space with bright lights, walkways, stairs or escalators. We get where we're going and there's other people there, one of whom is an officious little guy who is pissed off because (either Lynn or I) someone is wearing a pin or i.d. button that doesn't belong, it's much fancier than the others - I noticed it before but didn't see anything wrong with it - he takes it away and I'm wondering how it's going to get replaced with the right one. Some of the next little bit - don't know what it is, or who's talking - takes place by a small group of other people who are already in the "Team Room", and I don't know them but one turns out to be that guy from "After Hours" - Griffin Dunne, and I don't want to continue in front of him, so I move toward the "door" a bit so I'll be out of his line of vision.

I have come from somewhere else to a house where some others taking a mastery class live, we're getting ready to go together. There's at least a brother and sister, maybe more. I move, with somebody else, to a sun/sitting room where the sister is - these people are recent grads and are expressing their apprehension of "having" to process all the time in the future so hard, it won't be any fun. I make a little speechie about how after you get used to it and good at it you don't work so hard and - although Roy doesn't think in these terms - gee whiz, you can go whole days without processing anything. And that eventually your mind gets trained not to react in the old way, so it's not as though it's a constant uphill struggle. (139 words)

Lifegame Roomset - small, high room - sort of an old school classroom, I think - pulling paper off a large board, taped to the sides - trying to do it neatly. The usual speech about setting it so they can get it. Soft carpet. Do we have something to put on the floor (like newspaper)? Outside room - a place where a lot of us are milling around, tables and benches, eating lunch. Is part of it outside or not? There's a kind of little terrace or platform - 3 or 4 steps up, then toilets to the left, maybe 4 or 5, and very busy. I need to go to the bathroom, and finally try to get up to one. Get beat out by a short-haired blonde girl. I guess I do get in shortly, and while I'm around here somebody is peeing and Sheryl J. is trying to read something out to a small group in front and has to ask for us to hold it a minute.

They've been giving me parties at work because I'm going to work at PF temporarily - reason they need me is a new branch is being built and they're expanding - it looks like being permanent though, and I'm thinking I may as well not go back downtown at all - they may not want to give me more parties - PF has another problem - the construction people have struck oil - it's gushed once already and it's right next to where the building will be, so something major has to be revised before they can build. I'm talking to Belle and we go look at the oil eruption - looks like it broke up through the ground like a pimple or little volcano - I don't wanna get too close in case it spits up again, don't want it to land on me.

Cats - moving from one place to another - two of them, somewhat awkward - not clear - at one point I go back to my family house and see my cat there? I'm feeling relieved that he/she is still there. While there I'm trying to use a device on the end of a hose, dirty, like car-repair tools are - you're supposed to press a little nub and (compressed air?) comes out. It's not working, and I go to a garage (or ?) and while the person I'm with talks to the mechanic I try out the one at the garage and it works so well I nearly fall over. Then I try mine again and it definitely doesn't work right. Sometime I go to a friend's house - I'm carrying something - she takes me to meet her parents - her father says he knows who I am and doesn't want me in his house - I think he says he doesn't want me around his daughter but he can't actually forbid her and I think she says so. He's not hot about it but very firm. My friend walks me outside and I've got an impression now of Kathie H. and/or Bobbie. Sort of hanging on me, and I'd rather get on my way. (217 words)

John Leveranz is around and is he trying on my clothes or what? I think so - I'm talking to him - don't know where we are but we're inside a building more like an office or school than anything else and something's between us and some other people - he's also looking at a bill that he's supposed to pay, it has my name on it and he remarks "you're still married, aren't you?", which is startling, until I realize that, yes, I am, I just don't like to think about it - I'm going back to the other people and he finishes (picking out clothes?) and when he's all dressed I'm secretly pleased that he should think I dress well because I have the silk shirt, etc. I'm wearing purple, something pretty hip but can't describe now. Later, LT people are cleaning up a house, being impeccable, natch - I'm doing something in the kitchen that involves a little figure of a mouse or rabbit like a Beatrix Potter. It's edible, in horizontal slices, and I want to leave it for Sue S. but as I eat the least crucial parts it gets shorter of course until I think it's no longer ok. There's a bit of yard up front of this place which doesn't seem to have a front wall and it's not grass, but rather loose dirt. I pick up a handful and look at it - it has bits in it, pieces of pecan, maybe other identifiable not-dirt. Wonder how it got there. I go back and sit at a table with somebody and Ann Morrison arrives. She's colored her hair dark and changed her makeup completely, new hairstyle, too - and looks great but nothing like usual. I'm impressed. She says something about it but I don't remember what - I'm thinking marriage has certainly been good for her. (315 words)

I blow up my house - there's nitro in a suitcase I have to be careful with and I do something wrong - I know it and have just enough time to get out. I manage to scream for Lick and don't see him but I think I see him shortly after - then I feel a little relieved, though not happy, that I got out alive and at least I didn't lose anybody, till I remember MB and Tree - then I'm (stunned? horrified?)

I'm in a place in a downtown area, but not our downtown. (I have a feeling of it, how the town is smallish but not so small as to be rural.) The place doesn't seem like anything specific, not an office, but definitely not a residence of any kind - call it a waiting room. I have a sense of it being open to the street, but I don't see a lot of bright sunlight, or activity. Maybe it's just that the door's open, or there's windows. It's not big, or entirely empty, and I think the walls are red brick. There seems like benches are built along the walls. I'm sitting on one. I think there's something in the middle of the room. Don't know what. The street outside is a 2nd-string main street, busy but not the main drag. The buildings are close to the sidewalk and very ordinary brick faces. I arrived here by bus, standard city bus, and I'm not sure what my business is here. There are maybe 3 people in the place with me. At least one of them is a disc jockey, and one of them isn't. The one that isn't is kind of like Mike Rhyner, in that he's a buddy of these other guys and works with them but something he does is support for them (like research?) and he doesn't perform on the air, except maybe in his other capacity and not for entertainment. He and I are talking. Whatever we're talking about, we're getting along well and interested in what we're saying. The disc jockey isn't as involved but isn't hostile or unwilling for us to be talking. I get the impression, however, that I'm not "in" with him. I've left and gone (home?) and I'm not sure what the place is. (The previous place reminds me of a garage, and I'm not positive this place isn't similar.) Someone else is here, don't know who, and he definitely doesn't want me talking to the guy I was with. He doesn't approve of me interfering with him getting his job done. I know I wasn't. Don't think I say anything. (360 words)

I'm in a small house with my family - at least my brother and Mom, don't remember Dad -my brother's mad - it has something to do with jealousy - he says I did or got something I wasn't supposed to. He's not correct but I don't want him attacking me so I don't say anything but I start to pack up and leave - I don't have much, I think this is like a rented vacation house and I came here last. Mom says no, I don't have to leave and I stop, but Marcy gets madder and he leaves. He's so mad we look out the window after him to be sure he isn't going to sneak back and jump us, through the roof or the back door. Next I think a blond young man comes to the house but if so I don't know what he does. (150 words)

Mom and I are in a restaurant - it's got sort of a garden decor, all greens and yellows and white. The table is loaded with dishes and I've finished eating, so the idea is to get the tray of dishes off the table (my side anyway). To do this I balance it on my forehead and try to lower to the floor. Doesn't work. I can only get so far before I know if I move anymore it'll slide off, break the dishes and probably slice my forehead. Mom calls for the waiters and maybe maitre d' to get it off me. Afterward we get dessert - I wasn't going to have any but she ordered it as a treat. What I could see (it was on top of a pile of something) was white - I tried that and it turned out to be whipped cream on top of something to do with strawberries. While there, I'm looking at a long color brochure of things from the Container Store or - no, Crate and Barrel. Lots of red and blue stuff - brochure folds out, and this restaurant may be inside the store. One or both of these places may be located in Inwood Village - more or less at the Penney's location.

I'm with a group of women at a place we're staying maybe like a retreat for vacation. Somebody has stolen something, I think, and very slim evidence points to Jean Yocum (or somebody, at least an older woman), and I think somebody else. There's a scene in which the group accuses her/them and says she/they have to go. I'm rather put out at this because there's been no attempt made to prove their guilt, not even to give them a chance to say if they did it. At some point I've gone someplace or been distracted but I have plenty of opportunity to speak up about it. I keep "rehearsing" what I'll say the way I do in real life, and never get to that point before the dream ends. After the accusation scene breaks up, I go into the bathroom to gather my stuff, and either something spills or there's a puddle on the floor for some reason, and I gather things up. I'm sort of packing things up to go myself. (173 words)

Takes place on an artificial planet - it's smaller than the world but of course you can't see that. It has a roof, but it's so high that the place can have weather and so forth. I'm with Erv, who wants me to see something - we're "outside" now and going to where he lives - there is a sense of something coming to an end - not the "planet", or me, but I think now it must be him (caused by him being about to retire?). As we're going along I'm looking up at the sky, which has a funny color, but there are trees, that move with the wind, and birds. As I look there's a great group of birds flying across the sky, as a flock of birds will mass in flight, but it's all different sorts of birds! You can see from their sizes and silhouettes that there's every kind of bird in that group. It's amazing, that here on this place they will all do things together - just because it's different. Erv and I look for a bit and marvel, then he says let's go and as we go it starts to rain. I've been here a while and I'm conscious of how amazing it is that it can rain inside this artificial world. I start laughing/crying in delight. We get where we're going, which is a kind of apartment that Erv shares with a bunch of other people. He motions me into his room and goes to get whatever it is he wants me to see and I never find out what it is. There are other people in the apartment, and they're together talking, and this is typical for here. (288 words)

I'm with my mother and somebody else, talking about the Training and how it costs so much money and how it could be raised - my mom says something that fits in and says "yes, I want to take it too, but..." ("I don't know how I can get the money", whatever). I'm surprised. (54 words)

I'm with a group of LT people, at least mainly women - not sure if it's a hotel or not but we have baggage and one of us I don't recognize is looking for sheets (or something) to buy if anybody has some. She leaves to ask somebody outside the room where I am. Someone else opens a suitcase to check what she's got and leafs through it. As she does I see a yellow blanket that looks like it may be wool and since there's an indication that she may be up for selling this stuff, I check. It is wool, and I ask if she wants to sell this. It turns out to be Sharon Clements. She says maybe, and I ask how much. I also check the label again to be sure it's a double. (I've also been thinking it's a shame it's yellow, I'm not that fond of it, but it'll go with my bedroom well enough.) When I ask, she clouds up a little and doesn't answer. After a bit, she says it's not me, it was just when I asked her and she really thought about selling it, a wave of (sorrow? - it's not my feeling) came over her, and she'd like to go clear. There's somebody here acting as Team Support (though a Training isn't going on right now) and we go across the room where she is. [The place seems more like it's old or unfinished - at first it could've been backstage, now this room reminds me of the lake house we stayed in] This girl is sitting on the bed, with her back to us - she's blond, and Sharon says her name but I don't remember and she doesn't look familiar. She's friendly and is going to work with us, when the scene changes to a bus. We've just got on and are choosing seats. Sharon sits right behind the driver and I sit a bit down so the other girl can sit in between but before she does we see a couple, married, we know them a bit or somehow know of them, and we speak to them first - they're also here to be on the team. We all sit except the man, who starts pontificating by way of taking over this clearing. He is making sense but it isn't his business, and the other girl breaks into his speech, joining in with the words, which disturbs him, and she eventually subdues him, I think - she also turns to me and says adamantly not to interfere (I can't remember the words) and I say I would never dream of it - or it hadn't entered my mind. The wife reappears and says some hostile things about her husband - says he has officially (but that wasn't the word) forbidden her from using "Mrs" before her name, even though they are legally married - "he seems to forget that we..." is what she says. This is after she says her name by way of introduction. (481 words)

I work in a place with a lot of money (a bank?) and it's being robbed - this place is like a lot of buildings, nicely kept up on the bottom, less finished and junky at the top - a couple of other people and I are trying to do something outside without locking ourselves out - seems to be difficult. Involves short flights of stairs and heavy doors that won't stay open. I'm with a female (black?) and a male. Back inside, somehow I get an opportunity to thwart the thieves - I get hold of at least some major part of the money and run with it. Somebody I know is with the robbers, maybe helping them voluntarily, I'm not sure - but I figure he can tell where I'll go so I have to outwit him. I run down a hall and pass where I would go, down to a room with a lot of painter's and plastering stuff in it. I stash the money under a pile of cloths on the floor, next to a cabinet or something which is just inside left of the door. Back outside and down to the other door where I hope they'll see me just going in - then I think no, I may as well hide if I have a chance. I go further in (it's open and leads into other rooms as if, in a house, you've got living rooms that lead into dining rooms but big open passages rather than doorways? - best I can do - hold the image) and there are 2 people, Cynthia and another woman, who must also be blind because she doesn't react to me. Neither does, they must not hear me either and they're both motionless. I don't look for any good place to hide because the robbers are coming in - I duck as close to this inner wall as I can, hoping they won't come this way - but my right arm sticks out sideways at an angle and I can't get it down. If I move it fast they'll see me move it and I can't seem to inch it gradually. (I think Cynthia leaves in here somewhere.) So one of the men sees me and comes over, but he's not the one to interrogate me, he's an underling, so he's just going to let them know I'm here. He says "Stand here" and turns back to the others, moving away from me. I look around, see another room and duck into it quietly. It's green and a lot like the junky old office in the basement of the old building - no one's redecorated here in a hundred years. At first I think it's a lost cause but by George it's got a door on the other side. I thought it might lead to the hall but it doesn't - I don't know where it leads but one way or another I get into an office, where there are rows of people (like there used to be) with adding machines and typewriters - men and women - and I know I'm n home free. What I want is to get to the police on the ground floor, but I'm afraid of getting caught before I reach them. I keep running. When I wake up I'm still worried I'm not going to make it - sense of desperation. (570 words)

Not much left - I'm with (my brother) in a car, him driving, that stops going for unknown reason - I get out and encounter puppies - they're sort of spilling out of a storm drain, very small, very "duh"-looking. I think they're kind of cute but say they shouldn't be out like that, they'll get hurt, and put them back. Then Momma starts to growl a bit of warning, she hadn't been visible before, but now she comes forward as if she's been crouching at the back of the drain (as if it were a litter cave). I say hi to her and go on. Where I am is rather like a cul-de-sac or circle. We've come from a street, and behind some building, maybe apartments, the road runs by the back and turns round into a fair-sized short underpass, which is where the puppies are. I'm aiming to continue that way. (153 words)

LT again - the scene is something like the balcony at work. I've finished with a hair dryer that I'm trying to wrap up again and after a couple of times do it and it wads up a bit but it's ok and I leave it. Somewhere in here I've been singing, rather like those fantasies I have where I start a song as an example for the group of how I can sing and they let me go on - it's something more like a story this time, though, and I made up the words and it was great though I haven't the foggiest notion what it was. I think this is where I hug a guy who looks a bit like Joe A. (125 words)

A LT is starting ( or Prep Night) in a room that looks like an old-time school - wood everywhere and we even seem to be dressed for the setting. It's all disorganized, people aren't in their places on time and part of the reason is that some other sort of class is going on next door that overlaps and the ones in the LT have to be let go from it, so they trickle in after we've started.

I'm in a car with Dan, William Shatner, and somebody else - Shatner's driving. We're all talking and there's a car coming the other way rather badly, and I turn around to watch it. Sure enough, it hits another car head-on and I watch carefully because it's the first wreck I've ever actually seen in person. I remark this to the others, but when I turn around again there's nothing to see, both cars still drive and they're going round a corner to deal with the insurance, etc. Meanwhile there's a parked car in our lane and I remind Shatner of it, I don't think he's paying attention. He says it's ok. We get where we're going, but I don't know if it's a house or what. Later I'm at a party. Seems to be a costume party, and I've got on something rather elegant. I'm milling around looking for somebody to talk to, and I know a lot of these people but I don't feel comfortable and mostly I just greet them and let them go on and look for somebody who I'm sure wants to be with me. Eventually I go up some stairs, wide and curving - this is a posh place - and come into a long wide hallway or lobby rather like the ones in hotels outside the ballrooms, with couches and coffee tables. Some other people are there. One of them (but not noticeably Bonnie) knows I've been having trouble with my neck; I think she thinks it's my back. She wants me to try to bend backwards the way we did the other night for a stretch, and I don't want to really try it. Partly it's because I don't want to appear weak, partly because I don't want to find I can do it and be seen to be all right after all - which is partly because I'll be thought of as faking it. Dan and Lynn and Jane and Ken appear and I think, they will help me out here - maybe I can join them now and get away from these people's attention - they know I s____ (I can't describe what I think except that I think of their presence as rescue from the situation.) Later I step (duck?) into a bathroom that's fortuitously unoccupied (this place has been busy) and poke around some. The light's very dim, I don't look for a switch. It's longer than usual, quite fancy, shower stall, and something's interesting that's left of the door. Don't know what it is that I'm wanting to see closer, but I step in and find the floor all squishy. It's been leaking again, bad. This (thing - closet? shower stall? other mechanism?) has been repaired, big-time, and I think it's looking pretty shabby - I'm thinking of Mary Tod, this is her place, and classy people like her aren't supposed to have leaky bathrooms. I wonder if I should back out in case it wants to fall on my head, but I want a closer look at something inside and step in. (516 words)

A woman with at least a couple of kids lives in a Dickensian sort of tenement and gets thrown out because she can't pay the rent. It's tough but not the first time or the worst thing that could happen. We go along to another place where the landlord is more generous and frankly this place is nicer and in better condition than the last anyway. It looks rustic - landlord leads us round to our entrance and inside, where there's an intricate stair arrangement - I think of England, where there can be found these very shallow steps that turn and twist but there's even more here - you don't actually need to take them, you can leap several. We go up that way, rather than following the line back and forth. Also I'm on a bus going to a shopping center. Lots of people on, and I'm sitting all the way in the back. I get a phone call. I'm not surprised that there's a phone, but I think it's rather a disturbance and didn't expect them to actually have me take the call here. It's a girl who also works for the City and I don't really understand what she wants but she obviously thinks I'm in the office and is a little bit annoyed to find that I'm not. Also perplexed - we don't know each other and there's some doubt that she's even got the right number. The bus arrives at the shopping center and there's an Army-recruit thing going on in the parking lot. Turns out there's a lot of new recruits on this bus and they're meant to get off and join their group, so we have to wait a bit while that gets organized. I get off - speak to somebody but don't remember what about except that there's a question whether I'm one of them. (314 words)

I'm in the front of a bus with a friend, we have an errand or purpose together wherever we're going - there's another girl near us, sitting down (we're standing) and she's at odds with us in some way - perhaps we're suspicious of her, as though she were prying into our business. It's either night or late afternoon, and we're all dressed as if for work, and I believe we have coats on, maybe even hats and gloves. I'm sure we're all three "girls". (85 words)

I am a superhero with a costume, cape, and everything, except I'm not terrific at it - the costume is light-colored and not flashy - I don't fly but I do swing from a rope. I'm with someone - not rescuing him but we're about some business, and I'm swinging us from one spot to a rooftop - not high but quite slanted. Red tile. Another man is there already, he had a task of his own and we're joining him - we sort of all crash together and it's an awkward picture of us all trying to get our footing on the roof at one time. I don't know why I know it's me, since the caped crusader is a man, but I'm pretty sure. Scenery's nice - old-world village, sort of. (133 words)

He's doing Hot Potato, and I'm getting really pissed off because I missed everything. I'm struggling not to blame somebody else. Leaving, we're not going home, though, just to lunch, and I guess we're coming back - we're walking down the hall talking about what to do for lunch. (106 words)

I'm on a residential street - I've come from the next street over, through the houses, and I'm looking for an address. These are not family homes but sort of semi-apartments, maybe duplexes or four-plexes, upscale, newish. I go a house or two down the street and look at one, then enter up a few steps to an entry of sorts - seems like different apartments open off the landing. There are people about, but no one to take any notice of me, they're sort of talking amongst themselves like a Sunday afternoon barbecue or something. I'm not trying to hide but I'm not anxious for anyone to take any notice of me, either. I look to my left on the landing; someone (male, dark shirt and casual trousers) is just going in a door, where there seems to be a bit of traffic. I duck back out of any line of sight, being cautious (my familiar way) of being seen. I do, however, have business here. (167 words)

I'm at Mom's house - bedroom. I've put stuff on her bed and there's already a large pile of her laundry on it - room is mostly green - Mom and Marcy are at work. I'm doing something in another room, it's a sunny room, living room or den. (Don't remember what I'm doing.) Suddenly I have to leave, or at least it's time to get my stuff picked up before M and M come home. I go back in the bedroom and start to grab stuff but I get hold of her laundry and mess it up. Very frustrating. They come home before I get finished anyway. There's no trouble, actually. We say something to each other but I don't know what. (123 words)

I'm on a bus, sitting forward, with my shawl on, reading a book. The aisle's getting crowded, and a woman passes by me wearing the same shawl. I say, "How nice, where did you get yours?" - I think she doesn't say, but somehow she indicates it was expensive and I think that's kind of neat, I didn't know that. I mention I got mine at a garage sale, she says nice going. The bus makes a big jolt, maybe the driver slammed on the brakes. A little kid falls down and hurts herself, everybody goes "awww" and the driver decides to take her along to the hospital. We're on the edge of downtown now and a detour to the hospital wouldn't be much. Seems to me somebody will object, though. There is now a companion with me who-may-be-Lori-but-isn't-quite, and 3 (4?) other girls who are noticeable, and they move where I can see them (into the space so they can move, I expect) and start doing a "No". L and I are surprised and pleased and say to one of them who's not proceeding, "Do you want support?" She nods, I guess, and we start "No"-ing with her - doesn't last long. This girl, when she first came up, turned her back on everybody. The others didn't. I thought that interesting. I also think there's something different, off-putting, about the others. L and I talk to this one and she's a little reticent. We're not on the bus anymore, but inside a building. Maybe a waiting station of some sort - it's large and has standard glass doors in the corners, and it's located out there in Baylor territory. It's night now - the bus ride was late afternoon, after work. I've got the idea this girl has done est and want to tell her about LT, but it turns out she did do LT and isn't working comfortably with it. She doesn't come to things because of money. L and I talk to her about that - we're anxious to get to know her because we admire a person who'll do a "No" in public. We go outside of this building during the conversation, and when I get to the door I see the city skyline, all lit up like the Whatsit building. I see one building crack sideways and fall down. How neat. I call the others' attention to it, and as we watch, the whole cityscape breaks up and juggles itself around before completely falling down. It's like a chaotic dance. Wonderful. This girl is reticent about coming out to play but we encourage her. (439 words)

I'm moving in with a family - part of my original family already lives here, presumably I've got other, younger brothers and sisters. They've been taken in out of necessity. I've still got options to moving in here but not attractive ones - except they're getting more attractive. The head of this family is a hail-fellow type who's really concerned about me and a TV set - seems to think I'll really be pleased that, coming here, I'll have my own color TV - but not a big one, or a fancy one, he wants to warn me about that. I remark that I did have one, it's not even color, but it's not as if I've been deprived you know. (121 words)

Woke up frightened. I come to my front door, find it open - don't think anything of it at first, then not sure, so I turn away and an arm grabs me from the opposite side. I croak "Help" as loud as I can but it's not very loud and though I know there's people to hear me I'll have to shout. I try to breathe and call out but I can't. I know I've got to do it soon but nothing comes out. (84 words)

Having a meeting or class at my apartment - Brad Brown is here. (Not this apartment.) Very informal. As we get ready to break up everybody talks about who's going with whom. The young man I came with seems to be dubious about us going together but says ok, and I talk to some other people on the "porch" outside (all concrete or stone, including steps and side wall, no rail). Then I realize that since he drove me here why would I go with him? So I tell him it's ok, go on without me. (96 words)

I'm sitting next to a girl and a young blonde guy, looking hip (like the guy at the play but prettier) - we're gossiping and she says look who we've got gracing our party (is that what this is?) - she means this guy and points. I don't recognize him and she ID's him as an actor who's well known from one of the nighttime soaps, only there he looks rather preppy-ish. He's sullen, reminds me of Michael J. Pollard. I'm popping my little finger by pulling it out - whenever I do that the last joint comes off but there's another next time. I'm very amused by all this. (110 words)

A conspiracy - really insidious - purpose unknown. I'm with (my brother?) in a tiny house and there's been someone else here. There are some really strange guys been looking for that other person (a young boy) and my brother doesn't know what they want but I'm afraid I do. They won't necessarily hurt anybody but you can't be sure and I've gotten very paranoid. I tell my brother and we start talking about plans to get away and I even think about starting over somewhere with different hair and clothes, etc., it's depressing. While we're talking I'm breaking a couple eggs on the counter and scraping them into a dish or something - we're trying to look busy. (119 words)

I come into a restaurant with my "family" - there's not many people here - it's small and cozy - we've been here before - I have a small bag with me, I think it's awkward to be bringing it in here, especially since I've also got another small suitcase that's old-looking, with a stripe and a makeshift handle on the end rather than in the middle. We sit at a small table and start a conversation with the waiter. There's some disagreement here but not major - I'm the one going somewhere to stay, like, say, I was going to gramma's for the summer - so I feel odd man out. The waiter brings wine - for some reason it's an incredibly expensive bottle (like on the TV show I saw last night) and it wasn't exactly bought - maybe a gift - maybe this is an anniversary dinner for "Mom" and "Dad". I remark on the new arrangement of the tables - different sizes, even, from the last time we were here - now all little round ones scattered around. They think I'm wrong but I know where we sat last time. There's an interval and "Dad" and "little brother" go somewhere - I'm talking to "Mom", who's sitting on a couch - I decide this is a moment that calls for the wine, so I pour 2 glasses - one for her, one for him - I don't want any. I take it to her, saying I thought this was the moment for an incredibly, (something, something) - even embarrassingly - expensive - glass of wine. She's surprised at first, very dubious as to whether to drink it, it's so expensive. I'm thinking, what are you going to do with it? (294 words)

I'm at the office - it's bigger than usual, with more people, and busier. 3 young men come in and confront a group of people I'm with - they have guns and seem to want something but I don't know what. I break away from them and go out to the middle where a lot of people can see me and vice versa, and I start yelling something for help - it doesn't get anybody's attention the first time, so I do it some more. This starts people moving - mostly they leave, but somehow in the confusion the intruders are subdued and going to be arrested. As they're being taken away I talk to one of them and I'm sympathetic - these guys are just kinda sad and pathetic, not tough or mean. He thanks me for stopping them. I have an idea that his other partners join him after a minute and say goodbye too. Not sure. (159 words)

There's an outdoor fair of some kind. Loretta's there and has something in a bag she wants to share since somebody else didn't or couldn't take it. We talk to somebody. I have to go somewhere for a while - it involves riding home on a bicycle and doing some errands. I'm going to return some books in the OL chute but as I go into the drive I see Muriel [Brown], wearing red pants, (and some other woman), standing in the driveway, I guess just passing through. Rather than go past her to the chute and have to speak, I cruise past at a distance and don't return the books. There is some question about doing an errand at a much greater distance, but I conclude I don't want to go all that way on a bicycle - though I can - today, since I want to get back to the fair. I also go into a restaurant. I'm not intending to stay, but somehow I do have a cup of coffee or something and am pleased about it. The waiter (this place is in the neighborhood somewhere, and the waiter, if not gay, is young and in keeping with the atmosphere) brings the check and, oddly enough, change as well. There's a stack of coins on the check - or is it 2, as an alternative? - in the amount of $1, in case you want to make your own change. I'm concerned about the bill, since (as is presently true) I only have $1 and some change on me. It crosses my mind that I could just take this money but I decide not to and go back to the fair.

Melanie is with me, looking at my crowded bedroom area - it's in a place that's not all mine - other people live here, but it's not just a house - more like the open-office arrangements. My area is stuffed full of things, and there's only 1 electrical outlet. I've just brought in a new lamp and rearranged the extension cord arrangement, which is wonky. I go somewhere for a bit, or turn my back, and Melanie rearranges it again so it's clumsy and obtrusive, so I have to put it back. She's noticing things I have since she last saw, especially 2 tennis rackets. I'd got them on sale somewhere familiar (as in close proximity, like the Library Store), and I hate to pass up a real bargain even if I have no immediate use for it. (138 words)

I have been in this place before, a flea-market sort of place with banks of booths inside a larger building, like Big D Bazaar. I'd gotten something here I liked a lot, in the way of jewellery, I think, from an older guy, a craftsman, in a middle booth. I want another one, so I've come to see if he's in, but I can see that nobody's open, all the places are empty and covered up. It's not out of business, just closed for Sunday or whatever. Still I walk all the way around in case. I see a few people in the open space (like the concession area) - one of them is the guy I'm looking for, and he's facing off another guy about his own age and type - some other men are sitting down watching. I can see they're about to have a fight. They're angry, but not enraged (yet), and the fight is structured. I think they're going to use swords, but not fancy or sharp ones, and they're not trained swordsmen. I don't want to see them do this, so I'm gonna duck out. (190 words)

I'm at work but maybe not actually my office - doesn't look it. I'm on the phone with a branch manager who's trying to handle a book returned in some way she couldn't handle - wanted to know how to handle it and somehow it's turned around - it's Friday and she can't raise anybody for advice. She's pissed, she's gotten me by trying to locate somebody "official" who'll know what to do. I tell her I used to work at PF and OL and I know what to do more or less but I did know I could get hold of someone who could tell me for sure - thinking of Ann rather than Alma. She keeps rattling and the connection gets bad - I have to keep asking her to repeat. She's dubious about whether I know what I was talking about - if I really worked at a branch? which branch? - like that - till I had to be firm and try to get her to let me either put her on hold or call her back.

I'm with a group of people together for a purpose - we're going out for lunch break and drive to a restaurant (or go in a van provided by the restaurant) that we'd been "sold" on by this Mexican woman - it's further than I imagined it would be, and when we get there it doesn't look like one. It's through a house, and the house is high off the street. Bit of a climb to get there, then we all get led into the house. A room we go through is very uneven - there are steps in it, different places. I'm lagging behind the others, and so is another woman - we have a kind of familiarity - some similar experiences that we talk about, something to do with this room. (133 words)

A man is being chased by another man who means to kill him - I can see it all as if it's a movie. The killer isn't mad to kill him, just determined, as if he's a hit man. The other guy is nice looking, I believe I know him, and he's clever and has been able to outwit the other guy [the killer] up to now. He's still looking for a way to duck out of sight. They are walking, outside in a downtown area, where there's crowds of people, so the bad guy can't just run after the other and shoot him down. But he's getting closer. At one point the good guy struts across an intersection to fit in with other people, and the bad guy does the same. Finally the bad guy really does catch up, and turns the other to face him. The good guy seems a little bit nervous, but you can see he's trying to look at ease and amused. Typical adventure hero. He takes the gun the bad guy's holding, not out of his hand, but with his hand and moves his whole arm around some way that resembles locking arms to drink champagne romantically. Ends up with the gun pointed at his own cheek. So it appears he's going to do the job for the hit man, in a way, but he's got a little smile on his face and I realize that what'll happen when he pulls the trigger is the gun will pull the hand around and the hit man will be shot instead. (Dream ends before that happens but my reaction is a bit of tension whether that'll work or not.) (281 words)

I'm in a room in an old building, maybe a school, but it's a small place and not in a place with lots of people - in fact, this room is being used for some temporary project and if it is a school, that's not going on now. The floor is bare wood and it's darkish - all the walls and everything have been left alone a long time (but not abused). There are 4 or 5 people working on something here, maybe sorting things or packing things up. I'm lying on my bed in the corner. There's a reason why I'm not joining in but I'm not sure if it's just because there's not enough for me to do or they're almost finished or what. Someone comes to ask me that, in fact, and I feel a tiny bit guilty but I know I don't really need to be doing anything. I'm thinking of an object I haven't seen for a while, some kind of figurine or toy that I used to have around all the time and I miss it. I wonder where it is and I get up to pull the bed out from the wall to look for a box underneath. To do that I have to pull out the heater that stands next to it - old, tired, taller than usual, that gold/bronze color. I get the box and look at the things inside - there are several such articles as the one I was thinking of, that I'd had around before but put away and forgotten about. (I see them clearly and can identify them, but here where I'm writing I can't.) I'm delighted to see them again - they're old friends. I get up, put the box on the bed, and push it back. I have trouble with the heater, though - it sticks on the floor and there's a woman in the room - she's someone I work with, maybe my boss but this is all very informal - says maybe I'd better get somebody to help, that thing's pretty rickety. (The others have left by now, just we two in the room.) I say that it's just getting to move and I give it another shove. It doesn't fall over, but rather crumples from the bottom and the top comes off and another inside piece falls off. I look at it and see that it can be put back together but it'll have the dent in front where it crumpled. Poor old thing was on its last legs anyway. No great loss. (431 words)

I'm in a big hotel with a group of people who are doing something special, the way LT is, but it's not that. Part of it involves sitting at a desk or table, a long one, like rows of people at desks or tables, keeping track of something or some kind of current paperwork. Sometimes you get up to do something else, or maybe it's a break. I get up to go with some people going to exercise, or swim. There's some activity at my place and I know I have to get back on time. When we get to the other place, it's as though it's someone else's house. The others I'm with decide not to swim but I definitely feel I need to work out, so I go to change my clothes. I find I haven't got all my stuff with me. I thought I had tights but I don't and I have to put on my leotard with the relatively loose leather pants I took off before. This is taking up time and I'm worried I won't get in enough exercise before I have to go back. Worse still, I have to pee first. I aim for where I know a pool is - the place at this point is laid out in a curve, so I follow it round - by the time I get there, it's really bad, and I'm further worried about the time I'm having to spend at this - I go around a corner and see a men's room and think, okay, there must be a ladies' nearby - but no such luck - I keep going down to where the restaurant is. I've been here before, and I'm frustrated because I know there is a ladies', but it's in the far right corner after you go into the restaurant. I wonder for a second if I should keep looking, but I go down to it anyway, and it's crowded. I figure I just can't wait anymore, and I take some toilet-paper squares (as they turned out to be) off the top of the paper-towel dispenser, go to a corner where nobody can see me for a minute, and pee. Presumably on the floor but it didn't make any noise, and I'm wearing a skirt now. I blot myself off quick and leave, crossing the restaurant to the opposite door as a shortcut to get back where I'd been. (407 words)

I'm in a nice old house that's mine (but am I renting?) by myself and it has big rooms and a big yard and a garage. I've just come in and some other people have left - I go to the bedroom, which has a big window with curtains. There's a bum outside the window who comes right next to it and lays down as if to sleep there. (He knows I see him.) I'm uneasy about this. There are other such people in the back yard. I think they have business like they're helping build something maybe. I get up and (close the curtains?) go to find the phone book so I can call the landlord and tell him about this and ask what to do. But I can't find the number - he's unlisted. I know we got hold of him before, me and a friend, when I moved in, but that was through somebody else - a relative or something. I'm going to try, though. I go to the front of the house for something - to answer the door? And come back through the bedroom, noticing how big it is - the house isn't great big, but the rooms are. I go to the window and look out, checking to see if the bums are watching. I'm getting down on my stomach to peek under the curtain and see if the one guy is still lying there, and he is. I'm a little disturbed. However,somewhere I'm looking at earrings and thinking, "I'm really going to get my ears pierced, today!" And I'm thrilled about it - I feel my ears and imagine how it will hurt for a bit and then how it will feel to have earrings in, and how I can get long, dangly, neat ones. (Frankly, I think I'm in the same house, same scene, but I don't know how.) (317 words)

I'm in a supermarket-type department store like Target with MB - I'm putting things down her throat, as if I'm teaching her sword-swallowing. One thing is a sort-of knife but I see it has a collapsible blade that recedes when I try to get it in her mouth. I also see toothpaste and toothbrushes, including one that contains toothpaste (for travelling) - you fold up a section of a plastic tab at the bottom and it squeezes toothpaste out for you. I hold onto MB - I assume she'll struggle, but she likes it, rather. I brush away at her teeth but we have somewhere to be. And I'm arriving at a hotel with several clumsy pieces of luggage - it's convoluted and odd, and there's a lot of questionable people here. A man leads me in and tells me where I'm to go. It's up several flights - I'm not thrilled having to lug this stuff. As I go up the stairs I see various people, some of whom watch. The stairs twist and turn, but not in a regular pattern with regular landings. I get to one and put my stuff down, then go along the hall a bit to see if I can see how much farther. I'm just briefly out of sight of my luggage, but there wasn't anybody in sight when I put it down. When I turn back it's gone. I dash back and down the stairs, looking round as I go, even farther than I think anybody would've gotten. People are looking at me but not with curiosity, rather more like they know what's going on and don't think it's unusual. I'm not angry or terribly upset. And I'm at the library - I think I didn't realize that at first - I'm leaving, and I'm in the lobby. (Doesn't look like ours, exactly, but the ceilings are real high.) It's just changed, matter of fact - the remodelling has started, and everything's been moved out - what I see is a crowd of stuff at a distance that looks more like it's in boxes - no detail. Lot of indirect lighting. I'm wondering where everybody's gone and how they can check out books. While I'm there, Alma's voice is heard over the loudspeaker, announcing closing and about checking out materials now - didn't pay attention to what she said. (397 words)

I am outside, in the midst of a few small frame houses that may be out in the country, but not far out - certainly they're not in town. It's very "family" out here, everybody's close. I'm going toward one of the houses - is it my house? I think I'm just staying here on a visit. Between me and the house is a strange being - a girl with fur. I'm not thinking of her as a "cat-girl", but that is the sort of fur - I don't really know if she has a tail or not. (I may have thought it up after I woke up.) She's also very friendly, and we like each other a lot, though for a moment when we came together I was apprehensive. We talk a bit - I don't remember the conversation, but it's something to do with the reason I'm here, which is a wedding or something. In any case, someone is in transition. We go to another house where there's a gathering of people for this event - we seem to be helping pack up to move out of the house. There's an atmosphere rather like Christmas here, with people and things about. (The girl with fur has now changed to regular skin - she has dark, short hair, kind of pretty, lively, we are friends.) We are in one room - the living room, I guess, and I go into the next room, which is darker, and there's a group of things on the floor to deal with - I think some of them are presents, and there's wrappings about. Interesting stuff, and I believe there's wine bottles. (279 words)

I am very hot in the living room of the house I live in with my parents, who've gone out. Things were all right before but now I'm very hot, and when they call on the phone to check on me I tell them I'm okay - maybe a little warm. I get up at last to check the thermostat, which I can't see very well. I think it says it's been turned up way high and it's over 80 in here, and I turn it down. Then I look at the thermometer and see it's not that hot, so I turn on the light properly and see I've turned it down to 30 or so. I turn it back and now I have to seriously consider that I have a fever. I notice there are leaks in the roof, and I have to put the bathroom wastebasket under one, only to discover others, and I have to locate other wastebaskets. There's only a couple empty and I have to transfer the... (172 words)

I'm out someplace on an errand - the setting is very pretty, lush green, nice building, don't know what it is. Or what I'm doing there. I'm leaving shortly and having to decide about going to La Madeleine for bread or sweets or something, but it's a drawback because it's farther away from my place even than I am now. I consider doing without but then I remember another rustic little French cafe/deli more nearly on the way and I resolve to go there. It's not a place I've been to much but I think it will have what I want, and it's pretty cute. (105 words)

Me and 2 or 3 other women move into a neat apartment with a pool. It's more like a resort really - I almost think all the places have a pool but they're together sort of. One of my roommates is a shrink and one of the others is her patient - either that or she works with everybody at times. It's a glorious sunny day and we're having a good time - at our pool we have a 2nd, shallow pool - not a hot tub or spa, I don't know what it's for - but it has faucets for hot and cold. There are things in it - something edible that belongs to one of the other women. There's also soap powder in it, because it was there before we ran the water in. I'm trying to get as much of the soap out as I can. There's a guy here too - I think he's the other woman's boyfriend. Seems to be helping me. Somewhere before, there's been something about meat, and things in it - I don't know where it takes place or who's talking, but the topic of discussion is how we used to eat contaminated meat and now what we eat is very clean because of refrigeration. There were close-ups of bugs depositing little black things in pieces of beef. And the point is that if we ever have to do without our refrigerators and freezers we'll have to go back to eating meat with things in it - which may not kill us but we'll have to learn some new things and be careful about it. Meanwhile, back at the pool, I'm playing my radio and also my male cousin comes over to work with one of his patients, who lives in the complex. (A male.) They're on the opposite side of this arrangement, which is partly enclosed - sort of like a marina. He doesn't see me. My 2 roommates are doing some work on the other end of the shallow pool - I'm still doing something with a small bucket. We drain the water out and fill it up again with hot, and it makes bubbles - they have something to do with the work they're doing. I wonder if it isn't going to be too hot, but they don't get in it anyway. I do have to modify it with a bit of cold, though. They want it so the bubbles pile up very big, and literally block off (but not cover up) the girl. I don't know what that's all about. I look over atmy male cousin and he's doing something similar. I decide to go back inside. It requires some odd configuration of keys. Sandy Bourghs is there visiting, and she tells me about going out in the country to pick berries (or something), which sounds like fun. We have a pleasant conversation and [she] leaves. I love this house/apartment. It's got interesting arrangements, and dark wood and molding and a whole lot of character. I stay in here for a while with my radio and then decide I'll go back out for a swim. I don't have a bathing suit, though, so I'll have to wear my shorts and a T-shirt - I think about whether that will be allowed and decide it will. I picture me sitting with some other people in this and it's close enough. I also think I look kind of cute in it. I look around for something to put on my feet and decide I need a pair of rubber thongs - I think someone else is here and we find this very progressive, that here I am wearing shorts and a T-shirt and I would wear beach thongs too. Anyway I start out the side door and look outside, find I've forgotten my radio and go back for it. I see I've blithely left the door unlocked and feel guilty and vulnerable. I get my radio (the casing has come off the transformer that's attached to it) and go out the front door this time - as I'm locking it my male cousin and his patient and his wife come up the walk to go to the street and leave. I think how funny I can actually let my male cousin see me looking like this. I must be getting better. However, he doesn't stop and talk - I don't actually know if he even sees me - but it doesn't bother me anyway. (753 words)

There's a group of Puerto Ricans or some such holed up in a seedy apartment (do I live in this building too?) who've got up in arms about something - it may be a rent strike or something, anyway their utilities have been cut off. They're rather hostile and I don't want to hang around but at first they won't let me leave. Later I'm outside (but don't know how I got there), and I'm looking at the water spouts on the roof (I guess) and seeing how they fixed up to get water in by hooking up a pipe to a drainspout - the water's dirty but it does come in and I guess they boil it. I sort of admire their ingenuity. (124 words)

I'm coming to a bus stop on foot - it's at the end of a residential street that turns a circle behind some shops. It seems to be night but it may be the back-alley-like darkness of the place. I stand for a minute at one stop, then decide to change to the other side in case this one doesn't actually go downtown after all. The other side isn't exactly opposite. But rather than stand there I move to the next where there's some cars or something I can obscure myself behind, because there's a group of unsavory types coming this way. I get on the bus and it's not ded but there's plenty of people, including Roger C. It's definitely morning now, and he's being gregarious as usual, talking all the time. He's talking to me now, and I'm conscious of having been given substance and identification in the eyes of the other people on the bus because he knows me, and they know him. He's talking about a couple we know having finally gotten married, which I'm skeptical about and don't find entertaining. This is remarked on, and I reply that I have my doubts about the whole thing and will reserve judgement till I see it for myself. Roger has to get off the bus sooner than I do, and when he leaves I look around for a seat. This is a very different bus, and is furnished with bits and pieces of furniture; it's also L-shaped. The place nearest to me to sit is a very uncomfortable-looking vanity-type chair, square seat, no back to speak of, minimal padding. It's next to a quaint little side table, and the both are backed up to a recliner-lounge chair, rendering it unusable. But I can't effectively move them. (I sit on the little chair for a minute and stand up again?) Then I'm looking through a sort of pad of paper, long and narrow, joined at the top, which may be a calendar or something in its real purpose, but it has also some pictures inserted, as it were for advertising. It came that way. The pictures are of people's faces, who have horrible, catastrophic, disfiguring illnesses, and they're there to direct attention, public attention, to the need for help and understanding. People have looked upon these people as if they were monsters, imagining they were vampires, etc., and I'm aware that if the people near me on this bus were to see them, they'd do that too, and I'm not anxious to discuss it with them.

I'm with Andy, a male friend at a shopping center, very large parking lot, don't know about the place. (Sears?) is relatively small, as we walk toward it I can see inside it's not laid out very attractively but as I look I think it's probably quite normally stocked once you get in there. We're entering by a back entrance, where linens are; we go forward and I come around a main section from the left and back to the right side and look at sunglasses. I kneel down to look at some sunglasses in a basket on a very low shelf - some are children's, the others are so off that they tilt at an almost steep enough angle to spring right off my head. No good. The guy I'm with is looking at something else and I go to catch up with him and we leave. On the way I'm stopped by a guy in a white suit who asks me some questions - just friendly, but I thought rather pushy of him. I think he's asking what I like to do. I get away from him but there's another in the parking lot and I observe there's several, I realize they're Krishnas in a new costume and remark upon the same. I'm thinking they seem less objectionable this way. In the parking lot there's some things going on, like demonstrations of crafts, contests, maybe. I'm not sure if Paula Smith's around somewhere, but I know Sherry is. She's guiding or running something by some nice shady trees and I go to have a look. (I'm not sure what's going on, but it involves a mechanism of some kind.) Sherry is very happy to see me, and gives me some kind of support or advice. Later I'm with Andy (for sure), and he's being his usual boisterous self, sitting at a desk (in his house?) and making passes at me. I don't know how he fits in with the other place but I think he does. A movie theater, quite informal sort of place, maybe it's in somebody's house. I'm sitting (with Andy?) on the side of the audience, we're talking and not really watching the movie, which is some kind of kid-adventure affair. I get interested and get up to change my seat so I can see properly - I go to the back of the little group of seats to have a look for a good place. The guy from the bus is in one seat, so I want to be sure not to sit too close to him. Connected with this is Michael J. Fox, much younger than he is now. Perhaps he's in the movie. I see him as though I'm watching him, but this is all tied up with another scene, the dining room of a house - it's a bit dark - the family that lives here is a bit old-fashioned, and the stodgy old parents don't approve of something. I'm visiting with their son. They're dressed a lot like working-class drudges, and act that way, a bit on the dumb side. (520 words)

I'm walking with several other people, one of whom is Bobbie. Both of us are having trouble walking, and we've fallen behind the others, but I'm ahead of her for some reason. I seem to be infirm in some way, maybe I'm limping. Bobbie, I think, is okay, but just not as spry as she used to be. The others have to wait for us sometimes, but mostly they let us straggle. We're going to turn right the way the bus does, and I think we're making for town. Later I'm in an office building, walking to an insurance agent's or lawyer's office with another person, maybe 2. Don't know what for. On the way, a woman passes carrying a small child with a spray can of the "string" stuff, and it aims it at me. First it doesn't actually spray anything straight, but I flinch and react with fear. It does it again, a bit more this time, and I'm really pissed off. Mama takes offense, grabs the can herself and sprays it right at me, finally getting rather more on me and she frankly enjoys it, seeing somebody messed up who objects to her child's playing. I decide I've had enough and I'm going to put a stop to it, so I grab the can from her, wrench the spray top off and throw it away. She really gets pissed now, and warns me to expect a lawsuit. Don't remember her exact words, but she's quite sure I'm going to get taken to the cleaners. I compose myself and continue to the place we're going, knowing I'll have to clean myself up for the appointment. I wonder how bad the damage is. After we get to the office and check in with the receptionist, we sit on a couch to wait. I get a look at myself in a mirror finally and somehow I've got a black smudge on my forehead and a spot of white, as well as the pink stuff in my hair. I'm thinking now I might as well leave it and let the legal types see how I look. In all this, I'm concerned about her threat to get me in trouble, but not sure what to expect - I don't feel I'm entirely blameless (of course) but positive that she's the one who did the hostile act, and would be the one to get punished, if there was any question of that. I hadn't considered that, of course, I don't think in terms of me calling for retribution. But I'm worried that she's going to get me in trouble - if not directly, then she's going to mess up what I'm doing here at this office. (453 words)

I have trapped a guy who means to do me some harm in a tiny room and slugged him unconscious - first I sprayed or waved something in his face. This room is odd, and nearly circular, and seems to be independent. It may stand by itself in a house; I don't think it's outside. He and a partner have accosted me and someone else, and he brought me inside to look for something he wants. Now that I've stopped him, I'm thinking of how to get his companion... While I've got a moment, I'm dabbing on some perfume from a little dressing table and looking around. The room is stuffed full of clothes and stuff, old furnishings, but it's tiny... Maybe I should tie him up instead - might come to, then I'd be back where I started. I find a tie and tie his hands. While I'm doing this he starts to come around so I slug him again. I'm enjoying that. I haven't tied anyone up before, so I'm not doing a very efficient job. Especially, I tie his feet and mean to tie his hands to them but they ought to be in back. He's a bit conscious now, and I ask him how flexible he is, can he put his feet through his hands and come up that way? He doesn't think so. There are people around by this time, we seem to have relocated to a street corner or somewhere. I'm conscious that they may thinking I'm the bad guy here and they ought to do something about me.

Kirk driving me and another girl - decide to get something to eat, go to a place where there's a big pistachio cake we drool over in the window, as well as a German chocolate, and then some others. A hotel where I take an elevator to a floor I'm not familiar with and see a girl with long blonde hair who recognizes me and looks familiar to me - but we don't know where we know each other from. She appears at first to have a sort of film over her face. There's a banquet going on somewhere and I'm looking for another exit - the back way is where they've kept the rolls and I mean to steal one. I don't grab when it's easiest but when I'm already out in the hall and may be seen by the serving women. I put it on the plate of food I now have in my hand, hoping it won't be noticed. Someone is collecting money in strange boxes which it is thought are hard to figure out how to get into, but which aren't. They have a sliding top, that's all, and are of wood painted white. The money is for a good cause, and we're on a street sidewalk where the overseer of this showing me how it works. Dirk picks me up from there. (227 words)

I'm driving to my male cousin's for my appointment - I'm with somebody else and I'm late for some reason. When I get there finally he's rather perturbed because he's got a group together and they're wanting to go someplace for breakfast and work there. I didn't even know about the group - he's arranged this because he's going out of town and is taking care of everybody at once. His house is interesting, with a kind of close front door and entry going back to a kitchen/dining area and the group is in a room left of that. Kitchen light is yellow. They've all had to wait, not just for me, but 1 or 2 others, and now we all get up and leave for someplace, maybe Denny's. I get back in the car - it's either raining or been raining and this is an old convertible, maybe a sports car, top up. I have to take my male cousin's dog with me - it's maybe a Basset Hound and typically morose-looking, willing to be shunted round but not enthusiastic. We leave. On the way I decide, hell, I'm not hungry, and this doesn't sound that great, I'm not gonna go. So I just take off on my own path. (211 words)

I'm at the library doing something about furniture in a reading room that bears no resemblance to anything in the new or old buildings - it's a very quiet, isolated room with big windows (or a window-wall) that look out over a lot of blue sky and a clean, green landscape with white buildings. The room is in shade. There's a magazine rack to be moved or sold, the furniture has been changed somewhat in function. I look around and find the magazines are now just arranged on top of a cabinet, in the old-style red-edged holders. There's not a lot of furniture here at all, and I don't actually see any tables for reading, or anything much in the way of people using the room, but I know it's a reading room like the old one, for magazines and newspapers. I think it has a parquet floor. 
       I'm leaving, and Lisa is with me. We're going to get something to eat together, and she's driving. We're going into an old neighborhood and it's dark and the feel of the place is that I've gone back in time to Grandmom's neighborhood. Lisa says something, responding to me, that is very typically Pleasing-type, and I react amused, and comment on it. She doesn't know about this, so I explain a bit and also make clear that there's nothing wrong with it, it's just that it's so recognizable. [What she said was in response to me expressing some kind of discomfort and she offered ways to help, but I don't know what it was that I'd said.] We get where we're going, which is a kind of drug/grocery store, small, old-timey, and I live there, or at least I keep my groceries there. I have an ice chest and something else and I'm looking at a couple of large chocolate cakes, sheet size, with chocolate frosting and nuts on top, they're probably more ie than cake. I don't remember how I got them, but I wonder what I can do with them besides eat them all at once like a glutton. I have an inspiration: I'll keep them and have them at a party! No, 2 parties! Considering how big they are, they'll do very well - even cut in half they'll serve a lot of people. I can freeze them until then. I'll cut them in half, and they'll fit in the ice chest better since they're a little too big the way they are. I open the lid and see that the ice is mostly melted. Oh dear, I can't put cake in there. Even wrapped up the best possible way, it won't prevent it from getting soaked eventually. I'll have to think of something else. Meanwhile I notice that my space is being a bit further limited by the produce/cold case that's been shoved further forward and now forms a part of my area = I remark to Lisa that what's in it isn't mine after all, but the store people probably just didn't think how awkward that is.

I'm supposed to go to a city on a plane - I'm running behind all the way. I live in a small frame house on a quiet little street in a neighborhood near the airport, with my stepmother and Dad and I supposemy brother - everybody's going out but Dad, and while I'm packing they all leave. (There was some question about whether Dad would leave too, and I think someone reminds him to lock the door.) I throw things in the suitcase and run on out to the bus stop. The bus stop is only a block or so away. It's dusk, getting later, and I get on a bus after a fidgety wait, and realize it's the wrong one. (I think; not sure about this point.) Also, I've opened the suitcase to refold something and found that I've forgotten very important things like a sweater or something to keep warm with, and I know I have to go back. I've got only half an hour, which is pretty desperate. I know I'll have to drive my car instead of taking the bus. Hadn't wanted to do that because I didn't want to pay to leave it at the airport, but maybe Dad can drive it back and I'll just have to trust him. (I hadn't before.) I know I've got to get off this bus right away, before I get too far to get home, so I throw stuff back in the suitcase and run to the front to stop the driver. Somehow I run back home (even though the case is heavy - perhaps I don't even have it). I go around to the back door first, hoping that either Dad's home or he's left it unlocked. (There seems to be something right in front of the door, which at first I thought was propping it open, but the door is shut.) It is unlocked - I turn the knob and go in, and he's on the couch in the living room watching TV. I run to get clothes, including a nightgown and slippers, and when I open the suitcase, I wonder about the typewriter that's in there. [This is my ex's old typewriter.] I don't really remember putting it there, and I don't think I really need it - after another moment or two I decide to take it out - it's heavy and I can get along much better without it. I check the time and find I've now got 20 minutes (or is it 10?). Things are getting pretty hairy. I am looking at a purple sweater or jacket that I wear with a T-shirt or something else short-sleeved, and find that I haven't got that because my brother's wearing it, which I don't appreciate. How inconsiderate of him to wear my shirt when I want it. Dadand I do get in the car and go on to the airport, but I don't know if I get there in time. (490 words)

I'm waiting in a line for a haircut. This is in a department store, methinks, and it's not a proper salon, but perhaps the haircutter is visiting or something, he's set up by some partitions, just one chair, and there's a steady stream of people to get their hair cut. The guy behind me is quite chatty - young new-wave type, he's talking about hair and hairstyles, the hairdresser, etc. I'm rather quiet - I'm becoming concerned that I'm getting my hair cut here instead of letting Loretta do it. Is she going to feel insulted? Is this disloyal of me? Maybe I should bug out and call Loretta after all. However, I'm already here and I really do want my hair cut, so why not go ahead? She probably won't mind, after all. And it's something different to do. 
       I get up to almost the head of the line and I get instructions to go to the ladies' room and wash my hair. It's a biggish place, all tile, of course, maybe red or terracotta, all clean and bright. I shampoo my hair and rinse, but not very long, and when I go to the mirror and run my brush through my hair, it gets all soapy again and I go "yuck" and have to rinse again. For some reason, even though this counter/sink/mirror arrangement is a narrow spot, it's the same opposite, and my next move is to turn around to the other mirror to finish whatever I'm doing (drying my hair?). Back at the ranch, I join up with the kid again and he's got the idea he can cut my hair himself. He's got style, he says, and he's creative, why not let him try his hand? I figure he can't do all that much damage before my turn comes; so I go along with it. I don't actually seem to remember him cutting my hair clearly, but he does a lousy job, with clumsy chunks out of it. I know it looks dumb but I'll just wait for the pro to recut it. It's just about my turn now. (355 words)

Bobbie is working at a kind of carrel, imagine a bigger micro reader or charge machine, where it comes over your head. What she's doing involves cards, or something to move about, and I'm coming in from the next room, expecting to do something else, but I can see I really should be helping her. At least, I have the impression that she expects me to, or at least wishes I would but that isn't said. I don't want to, and I'm wondering if I can get away without it. There's an identical carrel behind her, and I start to do something at it. Bobbie goes out for a minute. (110 words)

I've just come into a room, from outside, with a male companion; this is a place I've been living with my ex, who is also present, and I've recently broken up with him. I'm here to pack up some things I haven't moved out yet, and my ex is really upset about the whole thing. He doesn't start an argument or say anything really inflammatory, but he's seething, as though his pride is hurt and I've done him a great injustice. The other guy is fairly nonchalant - he didn't contribute to any of this, and we're not any big romance, but he is my friend and cares about me - just the same, he isn't anxious to antagonize my ex. As I face away from them (I think I'm sitting at a table or dressing-table), a yellow kitten comes round from behind something to greet me. I'm happy to see him - my ex and I had just gotten him before the breakup and I'd decided he should stay with my ex because I couldn't have all the cats and my ex would need him - but he's adorable and I'm sorry I can't have everything. The kitten's name may be Schroeder. [While I'm dreaming, I try to think of it but S. doesn't seem exactly right and nothing else comes clear.] The kitten is also happy to see me and wants to go with me, but I think (reluctantly) that it's all better this way, we must do what's best. (And I wouldn't want to take him away from my ex.) (243 words)

I'm in my apartment bedroom, with someone else (female, don't know who), while a delivery is being made somewhere and there's a truck parked outside my window. It's so big that I'm seeing the underpinnings of it or something - but it's bright daylight and the truck doesn't block the sun. My room is larger and arranged strangely, with (beds?) across the width of it, and somehow making it difficult to get to the window. The other person is standing at the window and calls to me that the kittens have gotten out the window and into the truck - that is, part of the metal stuff of the truck makes a hole that they jumped into from the windowsill. There are 3 kittens, they seem to be MB's, at least one is black and white too, the others aren't the same - one may be and white but I'm not sure. I think the other's all black. They all have names but I couldn't recall them when I was thinking about them, except one's called Trouble, I think. I'm quite upset about them getting on the truck, it might leave and they'd get hurt, or they'd fall to the ground where they are. I tell my companion to get them back and I make my way over there myself. She's got one back in already and then another and the black one falls down. Which doesn't put me in a complete panic but I'm into Emergency mode and I know I have to go get it at once, which is not all that simple under the circumstances, with the furniture in the room. (There also seems to be an opening in the floor, which makes it necessary to climb over the furniture.) I'm also terrified that MB got on the truck too and either fell down herself or will, and she'll be harder to retrieve - but as I get to the door of the bedroom, I see she's here after all. I also don't know how we're going to keep them from doing this again. [Shutting the window didn't occur to me.] (By the way, the distance to the ground looks longer than it really does and the kitten could really have gotten hurt, but I looked down and there were things down there to land on and I didn't think it would be desperate.)

Previously: I'm on a little balcony or outside upstairs walkway, and there's a place that I'm assuming is some kind of shop. There are things to look at, anyway, and it's all old-timey, maybe antiques, with lace doilies on things. I'm looking through a basket of picture-cards, like big postcards, and come upon one that shows a woman (all dressed quite properly for 1890 or so) on a funny kind of exercise bike, that is built on a nice upholstered chair. It certainly is quaint and funny-looking but as I think about it I think you could actually do that after all. I set it down again and mention to the woman I'm with what I saw, that she'd be interested, she ought to have a look at it. (I don't know who she is, but she's older than me; also standing on a higher level of the floor here, a step or two up from my part of the shop, and by a railing that divides the sections.) She says oh really, where is it, and I go to fetch it again and it isn't there. After an initial look where I knew it ought to be I go through them all again and never do find it. (209 words)

I'm walking down a road that curves to the left, near a park - it's open where I am, then a hedge-wall on the left (or isn't it growing up a short underpass?), then the park - there's a car coming - I think I know who's in it, but in any case I'm friendly to them, and mean to get out of the way. Rather than moving to the side, I walk faster - the car is moving slowly - and then I find I'd like to run. I'm wearing a skirt and wedge-heel sandals (like my old navy ones) and I thought I wouldn't be able to run in them, but I can, and I run round the curve to the park. There are a lot of people here, and they're putting on a play. However, the play isn't on a stage, it's in the park itself. Most of these people are acting in it, and they're scattered across the sidewalk and onto the lawn. I can't tell exactly what's supposed to be going on, but it's obviously an outdoor scene meant to look colorful. Reminds me of a couple of production numbers in "Oliver!" The players are dressed in some (fairly stylized) period costume of that sort (the "Oliver!" sort). I am more or less in their way as I go through them - I have to bob and weave a bit - but nobody gives any suggestion that it bothers them and no attempt is made to stop me. Since it's a public park, I think they must expect it. After I get through them I go on up a little grassy hill to meet my "boyfriend". He's sitting in the driver's seat of his car, parked up there, near an RV. I go up to the back of the RV. He's waiting for me, we're going to go somewhere else in his car, but I have to do something first. I have an object in my hand (I must have gotten it from the back of the RV, I haven't had it before) - it's a circle, tubular, orange, and probably plastic, maybe 8" in diameter, and it has a clasp or join of some kind, like a necklace would - the thing is twisted open and I'm trying to bring it back together and hook it in place.

I'm in a grocery store, towards the back, and I'm looking at things on shelves that make a corner, where I can't be readily seen. Nobody passes by much. As I'm standing I shit. I feel it, and the natural urge to void, then I realize what I'm doing. I'm startled and horrified and turn with my back to the shelves and try to shake it off. Won't go. A person or 2 walks by and doesn't notice, and I finally realize I'm wearing a skirt and underpants. (I'd thought I had nothing on from the waist down at least.) This means it's not just one long turd hanging off, though, it's mashed in my pants. Yuck. But at least I can go to the bathroom. When I get there, there's a line. Theo is in it. I'm not very happy about having to wait. (145 words)

I've just come back to the "library" from being out somewhere and Bobbie wants me to fix up some displays on tables. She points out others and asks if I didn't do some of those. I said I had, sort of -I just fixed them up a bit. I wish she wouldn't ask me to do things like that. The room looks rather like an exhibit hall. The displays seem to be ceramic or porcelain - plates and bowls and colorful objects. (82 words)

I'm in a small plain room with a high ceiling and long tables going across. We're supposed to be looking at a film. It's the next place I went in the "library" and I'm on the staff here, the others are patrons. The person who set this up has to leave and asks me to take over. Again I'm not thrilled about this and say to the 3 or 4 others that I've never done this before. I also drop my stuff on the floor. (Books, notebook, etc.) While the film is going on (I guess) a troop of people, mostly kids, come through the door and into the next room (to their right - an open passage - room is dark - another door opposite - looks a bit lab-like). Dana's with them, and I go talk to her. I notice one, then another, then another, of these kids look like younger versions of people I know and I realize they must be the offspring (I'm only aware of boys, though) of those people. I'm taken aback and say to myself the time has passed and I didn't even know it - that my friends could all have kids this big. I say this to Dana and she agrees. She's trying to keep them all organized for a tour and periodically gives instructions - they go across and out the other door. They all get through and the lot leaves. I go back to the other room.

I've been kidnapped - held prisoner in a little frame house by a group of men, all typical bad-guy types, led by a smallish guy with dark hair and eyes and several days' growth of beard, and a big mustache. Looks like he's trying to be a Pancho Villa, sort of. They're not holding me for ransom, I don't think - it's a power trip and I'm being threatened with rape, though nothing's happened yet. I get moved from one room to another some, I'm not stuck in one place. I feel tense and dreadful, but not terrified. There are always hints and innuendoes about what can happen to me and mostly I just stay quiet and don't disturb anything in case I might draw attention to myself. Lori and Tom are here somewhere, but I don't know why. I think they're prisoners too but I'm not sure about their status. At least they don't seem to be getting the same treatment that I do, except that once the little nasty guy had Tom do some things with me. It was kind of like dancing and kind of like feeling me up but didn't go very far. At first I didn't know it wasTom and when I found out I was kind of relieved.Tom was kind of nervous and spooked, keeping quiet like me. At last they've left me alone again and I can look around - I find a way out and I can get outside when the guards aren't looking and run away. I check to see if their attention is elsewhere and take off. I don't have to run far to be able to "disappear" - the house is in an open, urban district, actually quite near a big industrial "yard" of some sort, and I suppose a factory or some such thing - I can see downtown rising across the space it's a little overcast today but no rain., There are also a few other buildings round here, like office buildings, and right here in the street (I guess) is a little art/crafts fair, with tables and displays of various pretty things. This is just far enough from the kidnappers' house I think I can keep out of sight here. (Actually I'm not even sure they know I'm gone - there's no hue and cry so far, but I'd better keep moving.) I feel quite light and cheerful, actually - this is fun. I look around some and then move on - I go into an office building nearby. It's small for an office building and has 8 floors. I believe I'll go up to 8 - I have the idea I'll be safer there and somehow I can run up there. The elevator door is right next to the building's commissary/deli - there are deli cases in a horseshoe around this smallish room, with only a few tables. The light's very dim here, except for the lights in the cases., There are several people here, waiting for the elevator, which is dead slow. While I'm waiting I go and look in the cases at the goodies, which are rather tempting, but I don't get anything. (Am I not hungry? Or don't I have any money?) The ladies in the white food-service-y uniforms behind the counters sort of lean on them casually like they're a little bored, but comfortable and remark that this elevator's always like that, isn't it awful? When I came in I pushed the button for the 8th floor (from the outside, yes) and it wouldn't light up. So I pushed some more, and harder, and eventually the button just caved in on itself and the inside showed the mechanism gone. You just can't go to the 8th floor at all. So finally the elevator shows up and the 5 or 6 of us get on, and by George the button for 8 is already pushed in here. I'm a bit frustrated, since I really wanted to go to 8. I guess I'll go to 7, but I'm not sure I know what's there and maybe it won't be as much fun. (689 words)

A large rather horseshoe-shaped house - name "hacienda" comes to mind - I think it has red tile roofs, some parts are 2-story. A large group of people are staying here - house is neither my house nor a hotel, or an apartment building as far as I can tell, it may be an institution of some kind, like a school. The people here are more or less homogeneous - mostly my age, equal men and women - all engaged in something, which I think is putting on some kind of production. We operate together, but there's a lot of us and we have smaller groups for various tasks. [The house is old but not antique-y like some of my others. Lots of greenery around, reinforces the Mexican look of the place - or Southwestern, anyway. Whatever it is, it's a well-established one, comfortable and well-suited.] I'm in a back hallway, darkish, the only light comes from a window in the outside door at the end and a light on the telephone "booth" - one of those wall-things. Somebody who reminds me of Nan is using the phone. I wait for her and someone comes by us. For some reason I'm concerned, don't know why. Goes on down the hall. "She" finishes her call and we go down the hall ourselves and out and around to a gathering of people in a large, bright room with a lot of long tables in, I suppose, it's a dining hall. I don't see any food but maybe we're just finishing a meal. Anyway, we're all talking amongst ourselves and the guy who walked down the hall comes in and starts to berate me. It's all a lot of nonsense, he's really quite wrong, but he's really wild and seems to be coming unglued. Somebody (I think the guy next to me) faces him about it and he says (to wit) "Aha! You think I can't/won't do anything about this! We'll see about that!" And he brings out a large cobra. Everybody gasps and pulls back and he threatens with it like a madman and runs it over his fingers and all. I seem to be the most panic-stricken and I run, after I stare at it mesmerized for a minute, looking to see if it really is a cobra and if it isn't maybe this isn't so bad, but I think it is and this is big-time serious. I run out of the place and he follows. I run across the courtyard to a set of stairs and a little bitty sub-courtyard/patio and ask if they'll hide me. [Apparently not - I know I am back in that hallway again. May have been before the stairs or not. I do spend rather a while running from this guy. I am really afraid of that snake - they are really poisonous. (441 words)

I'm driving a car somewhere, because it's south of downtown like that other dream, there's a big space to cross from here to downtown, with open industrial things going on between. I've stopped at a little building that seems to front some grounds and may be, like, the cafe attached to a motel or a park or something. I get out and go around back for some reason - there are people around, some going along a pathway that gets you to the grounds, others hanging around socializing. I'm not terribly anxious to be noticed, whatever it is that I'm doing (I'm looking for something, or a way to do something, but I have to poke around to do that), so I give it a miss and go back to the car. I'm thinking it might be more practical and fun to go from this point on a bicycle, though I'm not sure how practical it is. I get the bike out of the car and try it out. It's really very nice, a very nice day for riding and a nice bit of path. But I think to myself, how am I going to bring the car along too? Actually I think I can do it easily enough, it'll just be awkward and slow me down and I'm rather in a hurry. But I can't leave it behind. (229 words)

I'm around a bunch of people working together, in a sort of cabin-like place. We're working at tables across the room (or they are, anyway, I think I came from outside). A few of these are my particular companions - a couple of men, one of whom is leader, and at least one woman. We all know the others though. One of the guys I'm with has a new rifle of some sort, with a fancy sight on it. And it fires silently. He wants to test it out, so he (standing next to me) shoots this other woman (part of our group). It's claimed to be an accident or is somehow presented as acceptable, and they cart her off next door. Nobody is particularly upset but there's some concern in the air. I'm rather impressed and the guy asks if I want to fire it. I do, but I'm not anxious to kill anybody, even though I know if I don't I won't know whether or not it really works so well, or if I could use it "when the time came" - like there's some future likelihood of having to shoot somebody. So I take it and we decide I'll shoot our group leader (who looks like James Caan), standing across the room among some other people. There's a woman next to him. I raise the rifle and try to sight. The thing makes a kind of beam that pinpoints exactly where to shoot, and I have to wave it around till I can steady it on the guy's forehead. Not that easy to do and I'm afraid he'll see me. I lower the gun and speak to the first guy again (he's nobody particular except maybe the guy from yoga class - not a boy, dark hair, mustache, stocky), then raise the gun again, try to sight, and the leader isn't there anymore. I'm shocked, have the sudden realization he's seen me, and is standing right next to me, and I lower the gun and there he is. Ook. He takes the gun away, says something to the people in the room, like "did you all see this?", and they say or mumble things like "not me, I was looking the other way", and steadfastly return to their business. I'm aware that this isn't a kosher incident any way you look at it, but I'm only on notice, nobody gets in trouble for these things. (408 words)

I'm in a house - I don't think it's mine - the others are out somewhere and there's a map here that's very important - belongs to someone who's out. 2 or 3 people, including a young blonde girl, come to the house - they're not visitors, exactly, maybe they present themselves as having business, but they steal the map - the others come back and find them outside nearby and challenge them on it. They're defiant, claiming they didn't steal it they had this one all along. [Mostly I'm feeling girlish and helpless through all of this and the last dream, too.] (88 words)

I'm out someplace pretty far from home and I want to get back, but have no car. There aren't any buses out here (at least not on a weekend) and I don't really know what I'm going to do. I'm certainly not going to hitchhike - I'm not sure if anybody I can call could come get me. There's a tour bus here, and people are coming up to it. Eavesdropping a bit, I learn that it's a natural-history sort of affair. It has pretty much only older folks along, but they don't seem to be exclusive, and it doesn't cost much, so I think I'll try to sneak on. I wait for a couple of people to check their places on the list the driver's got, and when I get up to him I'll say I was late registering and didn't get on the list. It works just fine and I get on the bus with the others, we're leaving shortly. The bus is an old yellow schoolbus. Right now I don't know whether or not I'll just disappear when we get there, or offer some excuse why I'm leaving the group (like I phone home and they tell me I'm needed), or maybe I'd even like to stay and see. But I've got to get home. I think I'd prefer to call somebody to come get me because using the buses means waiting a long time, then going downtown to transfer. Or I could walk. A long haul, but maybe I could get to one of my own bus lines. I'm at the entrance to the Faire, or perhaps another, but I want to go there anyway. I'd been planning to go later after going home and changing clothes, but I find myself here anyway. (I'm not sure how - is this where the bus was? Or where the bus stopped? [Or another dream?]) I'm wearing shorts and have a big shoulder-strap bag and a parcel or 2nd bag with me, not heavy but awkward to carry and I have no place to leave it. I'm hesitating, weighing the possibilities of not going in and seeing it now, when I'm already here, and being burdened with these things and not free to enjoy myself. The entrance is a kind of big tunnel, short, call it more like an underpass - you arrive at it from a residential street (nice place too); on somebody's lawn, quite large, one of those rises off the street but not too high. There are people outside, just hanging around talking, and you can see the Faire through the tunnel. I think I've made up my mind to go ahead and take advantage while I'm here but I get halfway in and decide this is not practical and I can wait long enough to go get more comfortable. I'm fighting a fear that it'll go away if I leave now. I can picture myself inside, looking up at a display (like the earring lady's) - everything looks more like a carnival. I'm in a very large room - gym-size - in an institution, perhaps - and there are lots of people (all more or less my age) who, I think, have to do with LT. There are bathroom-stalls set up inside the room in long rows and it may be morning and everybody has bathroom-stuff to do. Lots of movement. I'm looking for a free stall because I have to use the toilet, and I find one at the end of a row. These have 2 doors, one each side. The other door is open, and there's another girl in here. (These are 2-person stalls, you see: they have sinks and mirrors and so forth, too, actually quite nice), and I ask her to shut the other door. Which she does. That's all. (637 words)

I'm on a bus with a couple of guys - one's the regular driver, nice neighborly sort of guy, and the other may be my father and I may be a kid. [Hard to say, but my relationship with these people is I'm younger and along for the ride. They're the ones with business to take care of.] This is a small town, I think. Lots of trees. People know each other. Friendly. This bus is a school bus, but it's Saturday and there's no school, so we're going someplace else instead. Involves leisure, but I don't know quite what. I'm sitting up front with the driver, looking at a newspaper propped up on the dashboard. It has an article in it about a kid, a boy maybe 10, with a picture. Dorky looking. The article says the kid did something interesting - or he may be missing. Anyway somebody's a little bit concerned about him. We go through a couple of nice residential streets (I think we started in a little green-surrounded parking lot of a small office or similar building) and we come to a shopping center. It's really cute, with an eclectic design to it, and interesting little shops. It's an outside-oriented place, not a mall, you park in the middle, but today they've got things hanging on string all over the parking area. They're things from the shops, I guess, fun stuff, as a display, but there's rather a lot of them and the driver has to maneuver through them. It's rather tricky and they get thicker the further you go. (239 words)

I live in a little house a bit like Grandmom's - that style, wood floors and screen doors, not fancy. I've called a TV repairman earlier, to come and fix a TV set, but haven't fixed a time (or a price, I think). I'm just now coming home to find this guy in the middle of my living-room floor, working on another set than the one I asked about. I'm very disturbed about his being there without my knowing about it. I ask him who let him in, but don't get an answer. He seems to think this is all perfectly normal and I'm bothering him. The furniture's mostly gone from the living room and I'm thinking burglary, but he says he moved it because he needed the room. He's worked on several things so far, including things other than TV sets. I'm quite incensed about the whole thing and we go back and forth about it. I point out that I didn't order anything else done and I didn't want it done and won't pay for it. I don't think he has any excuse beyond "I wasn't told what to fix so I fixed what was broken", but still I'm worried I'll have to pay, and I'm really anxious to find out how he got in here.

I'm on a bus, going to the dentist, across an open space. I have with me a yellow air tank that I just bought, and I've pulled the "cap" off of it by accident and it's bounced over to the other side. I'm going to go find it; a couple of men come in, one older, one younger but not very, and they take my seat. I figure I'll go tell them, at least get my tank back and they can stay there, but I'm putting it off for a minute while I (chat with somebody?)...I see the guy, the younger one, nearest the window, lift up the tank - they're talking about who left it there? and so on, and the guy throws it out the window. He thinks it's abandoned and it's in his way. I'm not positive that's what he's done, so I don't immediately jump on him, but I'm looking out the back window to see it. There's too much in the way. I can't see it yet, but then something yellow bounces into view. I'm extremely perturbed but not sure I want to confront this guy. After a few minutes I decide it's worth it, so I go tell him the tank was mine. He's sort of half-sorry (but only half - he's more amused at me). I tell him I paid $12 and something for it and I'd appreciate being reimbursed. He says he will and starts to reach in his pocket. We're getting near my stop, though, and I'm worried I'll miss it because he's taking so long. I've almost decided I'll have to give it up and get off because I have to make my appointment. But the bus stops, anyway, and we're all off now, in a large waiting room that looks like it used to be a high-school gym. We're all scattered around. I guess it's like a stagecoach rest stop or something, the journey's to continue soon. People are milling around, some in groups. I make my way over to the two men and ask for my money again. While I'm doing that, I'm noticing the door on the far side of the room, it goes to a hallway with offices coming off it, and the first one is my dentist's office. I also see a clock and discover that it's only just turned 7.00, the time of my appointment - I've made it, and I can be a couple of minutes late, he's probably not finished with the last patient. The guy still hasn't given me my money, though, and we're walking across the room toward the door, casually. At one place we stop and talk, but I'm very distracted by the exhibition next to me. A pretty girl with dark curly shoulder-length hair is on her back on the floor and she has clothes on, but her skirt is pulled up high enough to see her abdomen and somebody else is over her pushing on something - with her hands - very hard, hard enough to puff. I can't quite see what she's pushing on, though. It's a lot like CPR but not being done on the heart. There's someone else there, too, doing something, I guess, but maybe just watching. I saw them before, but it seemed then like it must be some form of exercise. Now I can see her face better and also pubic hair and by George I think it's some strange form of sex! I guess the others must not be taking any notice of it - nobody's told them to stop. The clock is now at 7.02, and the dentist and his nurse come out to say goodbye to the previous patient. Later, I'm back in my apartment when there's a knock on the door. It's daylight, so I go to the matchstick blinds and look out to see who's there. I'm pretty sure it's the man from the bus, and he's holding a "Meerschaum" pipe up to the window so I can see it. I recognize it and go to let him in - he must have decided he'd buy me a pipe instead of giving me the money. I'd mentioned in conversation that I liked them, but I really don't need one. I think he's a jerk anyway. When I open the door, he asks to come in and I reluctantly let him, but I won't close the door. I push something, a flat box, across the sill with my feet, and mention we have to watch to see the cat doesn't get out. (765 words)

I've just gotten home from school - I live in this house with my Mom and Dad [not my real ones - a fairly nice pair of sitcom parents, we're loving and close]; I'm young but not little, and my attitude is light, cheerful; it's a nice day. I open the front door of the house, which is not facing the street but sideways to it; I had to pass between the side of the house and (the garage?) to come to the front door. There's a man inside the door; he's obviously broken in and is waiting to do me harm. I drop my book and run. I run back around to the street, screaming for help. Across the street a woman opens her front door, first a crack, then she comes out - now there's somebody else out, maybe others. I stop and look around; the man's not following me. (137 words)

I'm looking for a boy - I'm my own age, probably, but he's around 20 - I'm asking a girl about him - she's trying to look him up in the phone book, under Smith, (Bobby?); then I call and ask for him, and he says the name was Williamson, and he recognized me. I'm surprised. Now we're together; I haven't seen him in years, I'm glad to be visiting with him, it's comforting to be back in my old home (town? neighborhood?) for a while. We went to feed his cats in a big old barn - it's dark; (we? I? he?) put(s) the light on. I pet the cat, and a friend of his comes in - she's a big, farm-girl type with long blonde hair and overalls or jeans and a (plaid shirt?). She offers us each a hamburger and brings them in. My friend complains that his hasn't got any trimmings on it; she says she's been working hard and he's lucky to get one. Mine, however, is big and has a lot of stuff on, kind of clumsy, as a matter of fact. She served them in bowls. My feelings are warm, friendly, welcoming, grateful, overall very pleasant attitude.

I'm driving a car, going into town on a road,there's some structure nearby overhead, and this may be a bridge. I'm by myself, got business somewhere, on my way. Not anxious or excited or up or down, just okay all the way around. Daytime, sky's a trifle overcast, weather calm. I'm in a train or bus station (about where Union Station really is) looking at a display of Dad watches. I intend to choose one but haven't decided. They're mostly all alike, large faces, maybe oval, with wide, colorful bands, some bright solids, some flowery patterns and plaids. [They remind me of the new shorts I've got, especially the pink and black flowered ones.] This is not a crucial matter, but I'd like to get it out of the way so I can get on with my business, and I am taking rather longer than I thought to decide. I can't actually see other people from here, though I'm aware there are some around. The display rack is sort of tucked in a corner, this is rather a tired little excuse for a station gift shop.

As part of a trip to England, I'm visiting Pete Townsend, being taken by a man who'll introduce us; this is prearranged. We knock on the bedroom door [this house is kinda long and rangy, certainly not very English, I think it's on some water] and he answers - still asleep, really, very groggy, goes back in. I go to a forward room and look around, and then he comes out waked up and we visit. He's been to my place at home, earlier, when I wasn't there. I tell him about [gardens? "gardits"? can't read, don't remember] - he'd talked to an older man there, I don't know him. We go around to another room [a living room, I think, with a view] - his wife comes in, we're introduced - I ask her if she went to the Renaissance Faire that they had in London, and she says yes, she quite liked it. I'm glad. (126 words)

I'm at a restaurant with Bill Wold and another male - (I'm? we're? they're?) harassed by the waiters about another girl. We all leave; Bill and I are going back to the Center. I'm going on the bus; Bill calls a friend to come pick him up. [We'd been sitting outside at an umbrella table.] The bus is slow and it's cumbersome getting off. Bill isn't here yet. I go to a room at the Center, where there's something that wants protecting. I've gotta wait for Bill and this door won't latch properly. The hook's too high for the loop. I try to keep the door pushed to, but it's too much effort. Bill and his friend nearly bust the latch off getting the door open. Then I'm being chased by a man in a mask, on a residential street. I run, yelling for help - a woman looks out of her door, then steps out, then others do the same. The man turns and leaves. Then I'm in a very strange public restroom with a central/circular configuration of toilet stalls with high- and low-separated partitions - you can see other women's upper bodies. I look at a couple of pairs of very pointy tits, extremely curious. (199 words)

I'm in an apartment with some LT people - we've been together for a while, been somewhere and come back. This place has a lot of people in it (not this apartment, the whole building) and there's a lot of activity going on outside. It's maybe dusk. There's some sort of commotion outside. I'm near the front door anyway, trying out a key (yet another old key I've been handed - it's got 3 fronts to it, they're all scratched up and bent backwards but I couldn't see that at first). As I look at it I can see it won't work, and I see how soft the metal is and it breaks off and so I do that some more for fun. I'm talking to 2 guys at the same time. The noise outside sort of erupts, I think, and we go look. MB is here, too, and as we look over the wall of the outside walkway (we're upstairs) there's other people ding around. It reminds me of a movie scene of a Mongol camp or something - I might've seen cookfires and tent-tops if I'd looked around. Down below, there's a couple of cops all dressed in motorcycle gear with helmets and goggles, apprehending a couple of bad guys. One of the cops hits a bad guy just because he didn't like the way he looked, I guess, or he said something the cop didn't like. Anyway it was unwarranted. He had the guy by the collar and swung his arm way up and around and hit him in the face. I was appalled. I think he would have beaten up the guy if there hadn't been witnesses. I was feeling very disturbed, and thought I hadn't ever actually seen anything violent happen before. [Though that's not true.] While we're there, MB gets up on the wall rather clumsily, and I'm afraid she'll fall, which she does. I get rather upset at this, even though I know it's unlikely she'll get hurt, because there's so many people and things below. I call out to them to help her out. However, when I look over, I see there's some kind of awning not far down and she's on that, starting to climb back up. It's a struggle but she does it. Oh good. I'm relieved. We all go back in after the cops get ready to take the bad guys away. Inside is, I think, really Sue S.'s apartment, and she likes having company, she likes having movement and people doing things. We come here after a Training, for instance, to do LT tasks/activities and be together. It varies, how many of us, and we come in and go out at intervals. I'm talking to a couple of people, one of whom is a pregnant blonde girl, who got that way because she's going with a guy that I'm in love with, which is rather frustrating for me. It certainly reinforces my self-consciousness. I'm feeling anxious, deprived, small, weak, pitiful. I go down the hall to Sue's room for some reason, can't remember what, but I don't want anybody to see me obviously poking around. I also want to spit, the way I do when I cough something up, and don't want anyone to see that. Someone (large, female, like Sabina) looks in at the door and says something, though, and I have to hold it. Starts to go away, I start to spit, she Dads back, etc. I give up. (579 words)

I'm in a department store. It's big and probably being remodelled, things are not where they should be and it's very unfinished-looking. They're having a huge sale and I'm aiming at some fur coats they're announcing, 50 only, something like $500. I'm not moving very well, I'm stiff and like it used to be with my legs. I have an ice cream cone or a dish or something, it's chocolate, partially melted. A couple comes up behind me and wants past. I'm in a place where I can't just dodge them, so I go on forward, but they jostle past me anyway. They don't push me over but since I can't get my footing quick enough I fall over, my stuff spills - I had other things to carry, too. I feel anger, suddenly, and outrage, and I want to punish the guy. (It was his voice I heard as they pushed by me, and he certainly didn't care about seeing what happened to me.) I want to push the ice cream into his face. I lie there for a minute, seething, then I get up with difficulty, scoop up some of the ice cream, and go after him. It takes a bit, but I find him, I think. He's sitting somewhere, maybe like at tables, or some seats lined up inside a walled-off area (waist-high, you can lean over it). He's in front of another man and they face the wall. This is maybe in a sporting-goods section. Dead-end part of the store. I'm not 100% certain he's the same guy, but I think he is. Got a beard and short hair - my age or a bit younger, slender. I confront him and the conversation is odd. He obviously doesn't think there's anything wrong and won't answer me, but the guy in back does. At least I think he does. Then I think it's my guy but he's not moving his lips, or I don't see him do it. I'm aware that it might be the wrong guy but by now I'm so worked up I no longer care. I grab him, rub my handful of ice cream in his face and leave. I'm afraid he'll follow me, so I move fast. When I know he can't see me I run a few feet, then slow down and walk, then dodge over an aisle or round something, speed up, slow down. Still aiming for the fur coats. I didn't get one but, leaving, I'm going down Hillcrest with somebody and we stop and visit with a large blonde guy who, when he hears of my infirmity, offers to work on me some. Massage, maybe, or something more exotic, I don't know. Another time I'm at my mother's. I'm putting something back into a container - been out for a while and I thought this was supposed to be cold but it's not now. There are cookie-things lined up in a tray - they look loose but they're stuck together with something, I thought ice cream and it would be melted but it's not, it's marshmallow. I want one but I know it'd show and I expect she's got them counted and it would throw things off. (538 words)

Lou Ann and June at the office - Judy and somebody have been to a program down the street somewhere on lunch hour and Lou Ann thinks she won't have time but wants to go. I encourage her. Place has a hallway, looks like a newspaper or somewhere you have drafting tables. Then I'm getting a job laying out and painting lines on a parking lot for a little old building - there are men around, I think the ones that hired me, they're not too informative. I meet a guy who invites me to a buffet lunch at a place like a country club. We chat at the table with some other people while they're setting things out. I'm a little confused about his interest in me, and this place, too - is it really something he's treating me for, or could I have come here myself? Can I really eat what I want, or do you snack? This might be a fashion show or something. While we're getting our food, Becky and Lisa show up, they're on their lunch hour from work. Now I know the place has some exclusive overtones at least or Becky wouldn't be here. We say hello and talk about the food. I get a paper plate from a stack - a 2nd choice - and find it's smaller than the other, so I get another one and remark on that. I like this guy I'm with. I hope I see more of him - not sure about his feelings for me though. (259 words)

I've moved into a house - it's a nice little one-story frame house, not so terribly old, like VKian, as to have a style - more like a plain farm house-y look. Cabinets built-in, with screen doors, layers of paint, sturdy, darkish inside right now, late afternoon. I like it a lot. I may or may not have been planning to live with a roommate, but I certainly didn't know a bunch of LT people were going to live here too. They start arriving, and I'm quite concerned about this - I'm feeling deprived and disappointed, but looking at it objectively, maybe it will be fun and productive. However, something dawns on me all of a sudden, and far too late: I'm a long way away from work - this place is some such distance anyway, and I've got to drive to work! No bus! and it's so far! It'll take all morning to get to work. Damn. My mind pictures the road - it's as if this house is out in the country, and the road to town will be 2-lane, no development, most of the way, and I'm thinking maybe it won't be as bad as all that, with no lights and so on. But I'm feeling panicky all the same, not about the drive but about having moved in here without knowing these things and it's too late to back out. (234 words)

I'm somewhere away from home, driving a (jeep-Bronco-sort-of-thing like Lori's), with a baby - maybe a toddler - for a passenger. We're going somewhere for an outing, just starting, and I'm realizing I have to go back for something. It may be just to put makeup on, because I haven't done that today. We go back to the kid's house - not mine - I'm staying there as a guest, and this outing is in the nature of babysitting. The house is rather suburban ranch-style, one floor, attached garage, rather upscale, yucca plants and stone outside. I pull up next to the garage, and a man either comes out or is waiting and takes the kid inside. He's maybe a friend of the family, or a relative, middle-aged, nice, helpful. I'm sitting in the driver's seat, taking out some toner and a cotton ball - I think I'll try to get my makeup off in the car, dash in and throw a face on - we're actually not so much in a hurry, but we want to make this stop quick and get back on the road. I decide the toner isn't such a great idea and get out of the car. When I open the door, a can (or something - it sounds like a can) falls out and rolls into the open garage. There are large hanging things (the size of meat carcasses, but they're not). I'm concerned about having to dig around in there to find anything, especially if it's just an empty can, but a couple of steps and I see there's not that much on the floor and the can is just a little way under something. I get it and bring it back, and go on into the house. The house is furnished the way the outside looks - rather like Joan's - semi-modern, slightly upscale, open space, clean, glass table tops. The parents of this kid are a youngish couple that match the house - she's got shoulder-length blonde hair and looks nonchalant. They're just sitting down to dinner and they say as long as we're here, why not just stay and eat, then go back out? Sounds pretty sensible to me. (369 words)

I'm in my apartment, maybe asleep, but I've been in the bedroom a while and I have a funny feeling about someone being in the other room, I'd better check. I picture in my mind some things being gone, like the TV. But I go in and find almost everything gone - the shelves, even, that the TV was on - all wiped out, silently, while I was asleep. I'm sad, at a loss - I feel bereft and don't know what to do. It's as though this was visited on me as a kind of punishment or justice. I walk around a bit but mostly just look at where things have been, thoughts running through my mind, like, I wonder if I'll get the things back - what will I do to replace them - will I be able to replace them - I feel exposed, stripped, violated, taken. I go back into the other room. (157 words)

I live in a big ritzy hotel in a city. My family and a lot of other people I know live here too. I'm leaving soon for somewhere else and I'm packing, gathering things up, and seeing people. I'm in my parents' place, doing something in the kitchen (it's an apartment setup, with a tiny kitchen separated from the living room by a counter), like mixing up cat food. I transfer something to another container - I don't like the taste of it but I don't have a lot of time, so I'll take it along and deal with it later. I go outside with my father and some other people to put things in the car. There's some reason why this doesn't work out - maybe I've forgotten the keys, or the car's not here. I see several more friends, however, including Don, who comes along back inside with me. Inside there's a lot of different places to go, like any big hotel, and I choose an elevator bank to go upstairs. As we leave the elevator, rounding a corner, we nearly run into Cindy, who's stopped because she's dropping things. (There's a lot of people, bumping elbows.) Before I fall over from running into her, Don puts an arm around my waist and steadies me. I see Cynthia's dropped her watch (a standard-size, round dial, yellow band, design on it) and I exclaim, "Oh, Cindy, you've dropped your watch - I'll get it" or something to that effect. So I stoop for it, but it gets kicked away once or twice. Seems very odd to me, as though all sorts of things are being thwarted for no reason. Anyway, we leave her and go on down the hall, which doesn't look right to me. I realize I've taken the 2nd elevator bank again, rather than the 3rd, to get to my place. I exclaim as much, again, frustrated. Don says, "Oh, well, you'll get there, all you have to do is cut through there", which is a big open office behind double glass doors. Regular office workers, men in shirtsleeves, wearing ties. I go on through and find the hotel store on the other side. I'm surprised, having forgotten how big a store it was. It's kind of dark, has eclectic things like old-timey decor and a few arcade games. Other side of the store is a restaurant. The operation doesn't have walls. I think briefly that I've never been here, but now that I see it I realize I have too, it's just that I haven't been here in a long time. I thread my way through the little round tables to the open hallway and the next elevator bank. There's a waiter here who asks if he can help me. I'm briefly embarrassed because I'm having a little trouble finding my way through the tables. [By the way, Don went on back to his place down the hall where the office was.] I go on to my place. On the way, I'm aware of something that's mine, that's elsewhere in the building, I'll have to get it. (504 words)

In my apartment (looks like this one), I'm with the cats (there are 3), and they're having a pretty good time with the packing up. They keep bringing me things, including chain headpieces I'd forgotten about. All of a sudden I look and they've brought something else. The last is a large beaded one I swear I didn't know I had. It's long, and has biggish red and blue beads, very outlandish for that sort of thing but quite impressive. There's a noise; we all look up, but it was short and we ignore it. But a little time passes and now I hear the front door squeaking. It's creaking as though it were open and swinging a bit. [We're in the bedroom, and the door's supposed to be shut, probably latched, but maybe it isn't!] I'm very alarmed, and crawl on my hands and knees silently to the bedroom door to look out. The door's open, all right, and swinging, you see daylight all around. But nobody there, which is a relief. I turn back to the cats, then back to the door, which I mean to get up and close. But now there's somebody standing between me and it - a short, black figure, skinny - maybe a human black child, but with the sun glare behind him it's hard to see. It doesn't really look like a child, and it's definitely hostile. I can't see that it's wearing clothes, either. I'm frightened, knowing it's here to rob, but will attack me now that it knows someone's here. I barely have time to think all this and wonder what to do, before it runs at me through the door. I trip it with my body - after all, I am on the floor, and it goes down headfirst with its legs in the air, which I grab. (292 words)

I'm visiting somewhere with others, staying at a large place where people do a lot of things, one of which is going to school. Everybody lives here in the complex, students, administrators, teachers, etc. There's an event going on, rather like a graduation, because there are groups of kids in cap-and-gown around. My group is here to facilitate in some way, like members of the wedding, and we're getting ready to leave. I'm going into this room/wing to fetch my brother. The part I was just in looked like a school. This looks more like an apartment, with a kitchen sink and books and chairs. He's been lounging in here, making a mess, and it wants cleaning up. I tell him to...[The sequence of events is no longer clear. I'm guessing.]...start picking up and he farts around, so I do it, but for one reason or another - somebody bumps me or something - I end up with a mess too. I leave it with some other people and go outside (which is still inside, you see, but there's dirt here, and some planting going on) and start to poke around in the dirt. I'm just doing a little spadework to pass the time until we get going again - there's quite a lot of people around - those groups of kids, some parents visiting their kids, people having discussions, and so on. Presently some of my companions come up and we're going to go see about a young couple we know - I think these people are one of 'em's parents, or other relative, and they've just gotten married. They live in a room down this hall here. We knock, and go in. He's sitting on the bed - looks like Rob Lowe - she's sitting (on the floor?) at the end and there's at least one other visitor. We all chat happily for a bit - I think the older ones leave. By the way, she looks like Demi Moore - they're a fine match. During some event like fetching something from under the bed or bookcase where it fell, Rob pulls out a nasty-looking reptile hanging on by his pointy teeth to a paper or book. He's a lot like the "monster-sticks" in Labyrinth they were biting Ludo with. Pinkish, big head, little legs, vicious. He gets it up on the bed, but nobody knows what to do with it. You certainly don't want to pick it up. He's poking at it a bit, though, and I don't think it's funny at all. He might get bitten. Somehow it gets closer to me. I think he knocks or flips it and it ends up near me and I'm nearly panicking. I try to back away and say things like "Help me! Get it away from me!" and there's some confusion and when I look round again everybody's gone. Somehow I do get bitten by the thing, and it hurts, There's something thrashing around and a bit of calling for help and somebody does come, and it gets off me. I don't know what happened to it. It's not visible, but I don't know if somebody took it away, or it ran away. There's somebody with me, I'm gasping, looking around, paranoid, hoping there's not more. 
       I've got a splinter in my hand from thrashing around, which I'd thought for a minute was a bite or a sting, maybe poisonous. I see what it is now and pull it out. It's actually very large and sticking out. Funny. At some point I am reading an entertainment guide, or some such thing. (I think this is after the above.) And I find that Pete Townsend's going to be in town soon. I am real excited about this, and then when I look it over and see that it's better than that (he's doing a musical, for about a week!) I'm even more thrilled. I think maybe there's a chance I could meet him - but it's not that long away. It's very unusual that he'd be doing a show like that, it will be quite interesting to see how it turns out. He's probably doing it for the novelty, to see what it's like. (698 words)

I'm on a residential street, old-style, like maybe Grandmom's, and I'm outside, going to some other people, I guess I'm trying to catch up with them, except I stop at my brother's house, about midway on the right (my left) and find he's very sick. I shout after the others to come and help me, we've got to get him a doctor, but they don't hear me. I run after them and they won't turn back. I'm extremely upset, not knowing what to do without somebody to help, and these people want me to go with them, saying it's not that bad and somebody else will take care of it. But instead I go back and find that another person has come - female, I know her but she's not close - and called an ambulance and they're here and things are being taken care of. I have to help my brother to the ambulance - he can just hold himself up with assistance. (164 words)

I'm visiting my "grandmother's" house with MB (I think it's her) and I've been out. I come back to find my "brother" and his family (wife and small son) have also come for a visit, and he's still up. I come in the front hallway; the refrigerator is standing in it, disconnected. I can see, actually, that there's more than one about; it's as if someone had been trying to find one that works - they're all pretty old, and the one that is connected (in the other room now) is real small, black, sits on 4 legs and looks like an ice chest. Out in the hall there's also a styrofoam cooler with some of the food in it, including the cat food. I come in hoping my grandmother won't get up, but she does - she's anxious to blame the refrigerator situation on me and anybody else who's handy. My brother doesn't seem to be doing anything but taking up space - he's got a book, or something else, he's absorbed in. I go to my room to get MB and bring her out to feed her. I have to watch carefully to see she doesn't get into things/places she's not supposed to, including my grandmother's bedroom. She's very inquisitive and easily distracted. Later (daytime now) I go out with some friends. I'm not at all sure what we were doing, but where we are is right next to a large group of people, having a fighter practice/revel in an empty lot on a little business street with one-story brick buildings. They're across the street from us, on a corner. I'm talking to a girl next to me about them - she suggests I go on over there, since I'm so interested. I am interested, in that they are having a very good time, but carousing like crazy. Of course I think they don't look very medieval, but then I wonder what a real medieval carouse would have been like. Hmm. I say I don't have anything to wear and she says there's something here, I can use that. Where we are reminds me of a beach house, or some such thing - we're in a front part, something that corresponds to a porch, then there's a hall with a recess, then another room, then outside and sunlight. I think it belongs to a guy - he's in the back. I try pulling something off to try this garment on. (I think the guy sitting next to us is going, too.) Can't get very far with it without taking more off, so I go down the hall to that recess. Through a door is a small space where I can take my dress off, but the door doesn't lock. I'm a bit worried about somebody coming through and once somebody does, but I turn away holding my top up. There's a television in here, I guess - this guy remarks on the show that's on - it's a new sitcom called "Beach Party", starring Adrian Zmed, about the usual sort of funny-youth-romance sorts of thing. The subject of this show is that one of his friends can't work up the nerve to ask this girl out. I'm aware of the show and that it's only been on a short while and already been cancelled. I remark to the guy that I've never seen it at all and I wonder how come they didn't show it there. (578 words)

I'm in the Circulation office at work, sort of "borrowed" because they need help and I can spare the time, also as a trial to see if I want to go back to work here. It's not like it really is - it's an old, wood place with wood furniture, mostly dark and used-looking, maybe some painted, kind of like an office would have been in the 30's or 40's, but the computers are here and it's very busy. There's a lot of people here, a lot of them quite young, and I get the impression it's like a school or a family, and the older "kids" bring up the younger ones. I seem to be looked up to here. Alma really wants me to come back, because she needs my experience and talents. I'm feeling happy, needed, enthusiastic, optimistic; I like it here and it seems like I've come back home. At one point I'm sitting at a table with some other people and Mildre comes by. She's reporting the results of my evaluation or something, it had been some kind of joint effort of all the administrators. They'd all had a turn talking to me, then gave me a grade. Mildred says that I'd done very well overall, everybody gave me very nice grades except that she's given me a C- because of the way my attitude changed when we started to talk about [evaluations?] I'd become sullen and [?], she says. But it wasn't enough to pull the whole average down, so I passed anyway. I resent this a little, but then I resent this whole examination process - as though all these people are such big shots they get to pass judgment on little insignificant me. But Mildred and I are friends and I know she's just doing her job the best she knows how. Later I'm out in a car looking for a friend of mine - don't know her name but she's blonde. I finally find her in a spot, more like it used to be (this neighborhood is old, too). I pull the car into the little driveway and get out to talk to her. We've got someplace to get to right away and it's taken me a while to find her. She agrees to come with me, and I start off on foot around the corner on the sidewalk. The little street is just a sort of tiny neighborhood shopping corner, has some awnings - it's closer-in than Cedar Springs. I've gone a little way down the street and I see she's not with me, so I turn back. When I step around the corner, I'm face-to-face with an enormous black bull, fighting mad. I'm stunned and stand very still for a second, then back up slowly. As I get around the corner again, there's people around, and I start to warn them. Then the bull comes around the corner too, but slowly, and another, smaller, one comes with it. Everybody, including me, starts to run down the street. I crash into things but get up and keep running. I don't know what's happened to my friend. It looks as if she's hiding out and never meant to come with me at all - maybe she sent the bulls.

I'm in a house, I think I've been renting and I'm moving out. It's old and weatherbeaten and the roof leaks. Right now that's the issue of the moment. I've found it's leaking in the bedroom corner again and some other places I hadn't known about. This is getting really desperate. I'm looking in a big closet, that I usually don't use, for something to catch leaks and find the wrong sorts of things. I have to come through the back of a very big room which is being used for a dress rehearsal of a musical show. The floor is filled with people dancing a routine in fancy dress. I'm in this show somehow. I'm being Robin Hood, which isn't just a part in a play. It seems to be a sort of SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM-role with a regular band of men to lead and all, sort of clubby. I'm taking it over from Bill (I don't know if it's permanent or not), and when I see him back outside of the room in another part of the house he says he'd meant to call a meeting of Little John and the others but hadn't had time. We get in a van by a side door; we're talking about somebody else and I mention some car models this guy and I built. When I go to pull them out to show Morgan I knock them on the front floor and exclaim something, but I'm not actually worried about it. The cars - three - are mainly intact. I pick them up and then scoop up some debris from the floor and take it into the kitchen (we're right at it) and throw it away. Back in the van I see bits and pieces on the floor that belong on the cars (and some that may not, like a teeny plastic toilet) and sort them out. Then I realize there's some other things missing and I must have put them in the trash. I go get them out. When I do, I pull out a spider web stuck on the end of the paper, with a fly dangling from it. I remark that there's one spider who doesn't waste any time, and scrape the web back in the bag. I find the pieces, little headlights and so on, and take them back to the van. Morgan goes off somewhere and I'm pondering what it means to be Robin Hood. I'm still dealing with leaks, though, and when I'm looking again somebody breaks in. [I'm not clear on this point - did they knock at the door and break in when I answered, or did they break in and find me first?] It's 2 men - one older, in a suit, short grey hair, executive-looking. The other is a younger, not-very-scruffy, henchman. They want something I don't have, I don't know what, and I'm really quite scared, but as we go down a big wide hall I somehow thwart them and get the gun away from them. I point it at them and they run away. I open it up to take the bullets out - I don't really know how and may not be doing it right, but at least some are out. It opens up lengthwise on hinges and seems to be padded inside like a jewellery box. I'm worried they may come back after it and hide it up high somewhere. 
       At some point I go through a room where a friend of mine is talking to her young daughter. [I think it must be Brenda, though I'm not sure, but only because I think the kid is Angela.] She's renting the place from me (remember, I'm moving out?) and the daughter is cleaning up this room. There's another room being built right next to this one, and she says that they'll (her husband and her) be sleeping in that one, even though it's smaller and not as nice, because the daughter wants this one, but she's going to have to get the hardwood floor in condition first. It's been left to itself and looks terrible, but it's very solid and well-made. She gets down to look at the width of the boards and seems to think that's a sign of a good wood floor, the newer ones use wider strips. I don't know. 
       Later I'm in a department store at the perfume counter. I'm looking in particular at one scent, noticing the bottle I'm holding has an extra name on it (like they do so often now - a standard name is used with a "surname" as though it's a version of the original. When I look at the rest of the packages I see they all have surnames, as if there was no plain one. I wonder if they're just out of the plain one, or they're not making it anymore, or am I mistaken and they never did make a plain one?) The saleslady is still talking to the other customer. I put my purse down and look at some other things. In a minute, I see what I think is my purse up on a shelf behind the counter and I wonder how it got there - did the saleslady put it up there? There hasn't been time, has there? I go down and look, but it isn't my purse at all. For a second I'm disoriented, thinking I've forgotten where I left it - but it's down at the end of the counter, right where I was standing. 
       I've gone out and I'm walking down a shopping-strip walk when I run (literally) into my brother. He's got a rather New Wave hairstyle. Vicki's with him. He says, you run into people like this a lot? And I say I was looking at the ground (which is true), and didn't see him. Vicki says, you remember you were supposed to be at our house on December 11? And you left too late, or something like that? I say, I think that was the time I thought I knew where I was going and found that I didn't - I stopped at Mom's for directions but she'd already left.

I'm in a place where I work - it's rather like a workshop, a wood building, not very big, small staff - it's rather late to be here, darkening outside, we're leaving for home. I'm taking a cat (MB?) with me because she's sick - I'm going to my house. 
       I'm driving on an open road - there are other roads that don't quite criss-cross, but curve around each other, and I take the wrong one. I round a curve to the other side of the road to make a [wonky sort of] U-turn by heading into a ditch and turning around again, facing the car out of the ditch. I hope the car will do it. It does. I come back onto the road and among the (very light) traffic from the direction I'm now going comes a guy on a bicycle. He closes in and is ding me - there's something suspicious about him and what he's doing, I think I need to get away from him. I knock him over - by swerving the car or something - and drive on, but I'm sure he gets up and follows me - or at least keeps going my direction. I arrive at my house, and he goes to the house next door. 
       Inside my house, in a sort of garden room, I can see through a kind of window to the window of the house next door. He's with a group of people, sort of a small party, and he can't see me. 
       I like this house. It is my house, I live here, but it's as if I don't usually see it this way. I get up and go looking around at things, and the sensation is as though my time here is usually a dream and this time it's real - and the more I think that, the more intense the feeling becomes. [I am still at this writing aware of the sensation, though it's fading.] This isn't a dream at all, I'm really here. I go from room to room - this is a slightly upscale suburban-type house, one story, with untypical-of-me contemporary furniture, carpets, plants, lightish colors, things like apricot and tan and peach or gold. The garden room is not a patio, it's well inside the house with (I think) only one outside wall. It's for relaxation and comfort. There's a good-sized den, the sort that's wide open, kitchen on the other side, long couches and soft carpet, cushions. Then I go to another room that's dark. I find the switch to turn on the lights, but they don't come on. It's pitch black and I can't even see what kind of room it is, but I thought it was a bedroom. It's a little unnerving. I go to the next room and the same thing happens with the lights, but after a minute my eyes begin to adjust and I can see dimly that it's my real bedroom and not in this house at all. I realize that I'm slipping back into the real world. I don't want to, but it's happening too fast to do anything about it. I'm disappointed. (516 words)

I'm in (an?) apartment with (My brother?) and someone comes to the front door to sell some service - don't know what kind. I certainly don't want it, and I'm rather suspicious of him. But he isn't going away - he's looking towards his companions not far away (in a car?) as though they're getting ready to do something. I shut the door and lock it in several places - it's even 2 doors, and they each have at least 3 locks. My brother comes up, and I explain what just happened. He says he'll take care of it. This has to do with cats (MB?) again. (107 words)

I'm in yoga class - it's near the end, and the end of the day - dusk is falling and the lights aren't on. [The studio is the same except for a few modifications and some outside windows that aren't there in real life.] We're doing the posture where you sit on your feet and bring your knees up, but we're doing it for a long time. Or supposed to; I haven't got it straight yet and I'm not doing it right. George hasn't noticed for all this time and now it's time to stop. As we're all getting packed up to go, he calls 2 or 3 of us over to see if we can do it better with some props, blankets and things. I don't go first and I do something else (in another room off the studio that isn't there), and when I go back they're putting the things away, so I don't do it. Everybody else is leaving, but I'm hanging around with George, and we go out and downstairs together, talking. At the bottom of the stairs he looks out for his ride, and right away a car pulls into the parking lot, and he says goodbye and goes to it. I say goodbye and look for my own car, which I expect to be in one of the rows on the right side of the building (as you face the street) but I don't see it. I'm not positive just which spot it should be in, but I look up and down and don't see it at all, though there are several small white cars. I continue around to the back of the building, and a bit further, into an empty lot with a few trees and a little shack/house on it. As I come around that, I see an old black man talking to another man (white, I think) who's leaving, and the old man goes on into his shack. There's a kitten outside of it, black and white, I'm seeing it from a distance that I mostly see it as a silhouette, not a personality. It's playing, hard, and jumps up and down. It jumps high once and lands hard on its side, rather as though somebody had slammed it down. But it Dads up again, higher, and this time lands on its feet, slowly and gently. I go on around the building to the front again and find a group of 4 or 6 women under the stairs, one of whom is Susan. They've all come out looking for their cars, and haven't found them, just like me. (It's not one per person, actually, so it's not so many cars as all that.) They're trying to figure out what to do next. It's beginning to look as if they've been stolen. Seems like a foreign idea, but, well, what else could it be? (To tell the truth, we're all behaving as if this is so weird, it must be magic.) I walk back out in the parking lot again and turn around - then I realize I never parked over here at all - I parked in the front, where I usually do, near the bottom of the stairs, facing the building. I had been thinking I parked over here with some friends in the class, but I didn't. I walk back to the front, look, and there's my car, all right. I feel very foolish, but you got to admit it's funny. (562 words)

I'm out travelling somewhere (walking or driving?) and come upon a nice little shop, old-timey, sort of middle-aged lady running it. I look at some of her wares. There are laces and linens. Next, I'm arriving at home - I live with my family. My parents have left my sister and me in the house while they're out of town. While I've been out, my sister's had a party. It's a big one, too, the kind where they take over the house and do anything they want. I'm disgusted and appalled. Also insulted and ashamed of my sister. I go to my bedroom. It's a shambles and there are several people carousing in it. I stand looking for a while, then say very forcefully: "This - is - my - bedroom. Get - out - now!" They do, while I stand there and look. Yuck. My sentiment seems to have spread, because everybody's leaving the house. I'm glad, but I am also apprehensive of my sister's reaction - she may be mad at me for running off her friends. But I meet her in the hallway and she's not mad - she's rather relieved, a little ashamed of having it turn out like that. I wonder when Mom and Dad will be home. She says she thinks they're not coming back at all. Next, (we go outside somewhere on the grounds or nearby?) I'm outdoors on a large open lawn where there's a ceremony taking place. There's a lot of people gathered around, and a circle of women in similar costumes: very fancy dresses with huge skirts and I think headdresses. I'm not sure if it's entirely dark outside, but the light isn't daylight anyway, and we're seeing the women as sort of silhouettes. They're changing colors themselves; their whole images, not just the dresses, gradually change in color and pattern (kind of like "transporter" dissolves work). When this is finished, the "lights" come on again and it's daylight. You can now see that the dresses aren't all one color - one group is red, one blue, one black, etc. - I'm not sure how many, but there's 4 or 6 alike in a group, except for the last group at the far end of the circle, whose dresses are varied, some of them even multicolored. These are the head people, like they're in charge of the ceremony. Now they're doing some stuff, some talking. And now the whole thing's over and everybody's leaving. Some have to stay behind to pack up their things - I'm helping somebody (friend? relative?) who took part and there's a small wooden case with drawers to pack up. Something like a tool chest. Then I leave with somebody else. Next I'm driving down a busy street with this person, female, don't know who - don't think she's my sister. The traffic is real fast and I'm driving on the left. It seems like a perfectly normal thing to do until a car comes straight at me. I quickly look around and there's no place to go on my right. It goes through my mind, "Oh, yeah, I forgot I'm in England, they drive on the right here". I close my eyes and cut the wheel hard to the left, thinking it's too late anyway. I may have said something to my companion, like "Brace yourself - we're gonna crash." But we don't. What we do is go down an incline (fairly steep) to the parking lot of a little shopping area. [Where we were driving wasn't open road, but a place something like the high street in a lot of English towns.) We decide we may as well get out and partake of the nearby restaurant as keep on driving in that mess. So we go up to the outside window and get plates of food to take to the patio-sort-of-area. It's not a fast-food joint, but very relaxed and casual. My friend passes in front of a big blondish man. I don't quite see what happens, but he sort of knocks over her food or something, then starts talking to her, all very jovial and what-fun-we're-having. He even takes some of her food and I'm wondering if this isn't some clever form of gregarious panhandling. I am very protective of my own food. Where he's sitting is some steps, next to a brick divider with plants in it, and there's a bit of a place to sit next to that. My friend comes up there an we sit to eat. The man turns toward us and keeps talking. I'm feeling sort of imposed on, but not terribly. He is sort of handsome and rather fun. But I don't want him to eat my food. (791 words)

With John Boats and a couple of friends outside near maybe a farmhouse, with trees and sunshine - talking about (something nostalgic?) - a huge machine starts operating - it's for construction of something, like a highway - but it's not supposed to be going now and it's going to smash us all - we run - people scatter - I'm going to try to reach the car.

Scene in a Training, just setting up - I just arrived and I'm checking for something to do - it's in a kind of theater again, old wood building, dark in the theater area - there's an errand wants running and I'm getting instructions. [Some involvement with the parking lot here - did I go out to it and then not know what to do, or did I come in after being in it and not being sure where to go?] In a store or something - I'm on a landing at the top of some steps (inside the building), where the cash register is - I see George down below and go down a few steps to speak to him. He says he's here to do some [bodywork?] on somebody in the SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM - I'm surprised and he says he does this every Training, working on the new lords. I'm shocked - I had no idea that the two were connected at all and that the Training produced SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM people, especially not ranks. This is amazing. Later I'm somewhat around the corner from my previous location where I get hold of something with honey on top - the person dispensing it put way the hell too much on it and it's beginning to slide off. I get some on the floor, and awkwardly move around to a white porcelain sink, the kind with white knobs and a curved base. It's all over my hands now and I don't know how I can do anything without making a bigger mess, but eventually I get it all off. Yuck. Then I'm coming to the LT Center, which is in the place where the Bank is - sort of as if it were the spot where the ATM/post office is except you enter from the back. I'm driving a car, and waiting to turn left into the driveway. It's snowing or has been, there are drifts everywhere, idyllic but not much problem. As I wait I see that old man from the library, the volunteer, having just left this place, going along the sidewalk to my left. He seems to be going slowly and carefully, as if he were stiff and feeble. I don't want him to see me, so I keep my head turned the other way as much as I can. Someone else comes along the walk to him and helps him along his way. Then I turn into the drive, back to the parking slots. It's all quiet and snowy back here. My car has turned into a bicycle. I park it between two cars and go in. There's a sort of anteroom with a divider from the lobby, before the offices. [It's as if you came into the Center from the door into the classroom.] There are a lot of people around. I wanted to see Sue but I'm not sure I'll be able to with all this going on. I can hear a typewriter clacking away in the "spare" office. There's a blonde girl on my side of the partition. I know her by name but not so well. We say hello. I have my right elbow up for some reason, and she puts her hand under it and starts lifting me up. It takes a couple of tries before it works right, but then she's lifting me up and down very easily, like lifting a dumbbell - it's fun.......Seems to skip right into me being outside again, everybody else has left and I'm saying goodbye to Sue, she's in her car reversing out of the spot and I'm getting on my bike.

It's daytime, Sunday morning about nine, and I'm driving down the street on my way to breakfast and laundry. There's construction just after I turn on to the street, and a black man, fairly thin, wearing a workshirt, short hair, grouchy face, jeans, is standing in the right-hand lane in just the position where I have to edge around him into the traffic, which is heavy and a little dodgy because of the construction stuff. He could move easier than I can get around him, but he just stands there with his arms crossed in front of him, looking sullen, like "Dare me - go on, hit me". I do get around him, and still have to keep slow because this man and woman are dashing across the street, not at the crosswalk, but in a very awkward place and everybody has to stop or dodge them. Honestly. I pass a restaurant in the middle of the road, a small place, roundish, lots of glass so the customers can look outside. As I pass I see Bonnie in there, her family just being seated. I think she's looked up and seen me, but I've gone by too fast to wave or anything. I've just noticed what I'm wearing, as though I just threw this on and dashed out without looking - it's a T-shirt and a tan tweed skirt, bias-cut, rather well-bred looking, I'm thinking I look sort of casually classy. I keep pulling my glasses off and rubbing my eyes; I can maneuver pretty well without them, but I'm very aware that if a cop were to stop me for anything I'd be in trouble. I decide I'd sooner have breakfast and do the laundry at a laundromat than go out to my mother's, so I start thinking about where to go. I go on down the road, down the hill, and it becomes Turtle Creek Park, more nearly like where Fairmount goes down than Lemmon. It's darker, as if it hadn't actually dawned yet, and the atmosphere is like about 6.00 am. I've decided to turn left but I'm stopped by the curb, there's what looks like a road but there's a couple of steps (not a real curb) so you can't drive up on it. I can't quite see this so I put my glasses on. Now, I guess, I'll go the other way, but before I get the car turned around I see Sandie walking along. She's got a pitcher and a glass in her hands with something purplish in. I get out of the car to go talk to her. She's just out for a Sunday-morning stroll, with some breakfast juice, would I like some? I say yes, take the glass and drink - it's rather like grape juice but milder and better. Some friends of hers come up, that she's going out to eat with. They're going to a rather fancy place for lunch and I can come along, but I say no thanks, I really want breakfast - I'm never quite satisfied if I don't get it, but I'll come along and visit with them anyway until I decide where I'm going to go. There's some discussion about the time - Sandie thinks it's much earlier than it is, but I say, no, it's almost 10.00, I think, but one of her friends says it's just 9.16. I do remember now, I saw that on a clock I'd just passed. This restaurant they're going to is not far, and we're actually in it next. It's sort of an elegant little place with white tablecloths and china. Some rather good-looking dark-haired men in suits sitting at one table. I'm sort of aware of them being aware of us. (I certainly wanted to look good.) We're not at a table - somehow it's more like after the meal, and we're standing at a sweets tray (counter-height) with mostly fancy chocolate on it. There are shapes, mainly leaves, delicate things, and made to look like enamelled copper jewellery - indeed some were set up to look like earrings. There is also a log-thing in the center with a thick layer of chocolate around something else. I want some, of course, though I wonder if the restaurant people won't be noticing that I'm not a paying customer. The girls I'm with, however, offer me a leaf, which I take and it's very nice, but I really want some of the log. Someone cuts me off a bit - I really appreciate that. I am going to be pushing off for breakfast, though, and I'm thinking about where to go. I mention a place back up Lemmon that I'd seen from the bus, a French bakery, can't quite recall the name but I think it's got "Paris" or "Parisian" in it. I keep saying "dah dah dah", as if it's got 3 words in the name, but I know it's only got 2. (825 words)

"Girl/sister miffed - dithery guy on couch in her place" [I get a picture of a Southern-belle type, blonde, in a Forties pageboy, her clothes switch from a belle-of-the-ball gown to a standard Forties suit or skirt and sweater. She's doing a little foot-stamping pouty business. This guy is one of a set of men who come into the house we're living in, and he's usurped her place on the couch - she certainly won't ask him to move (maybe dangerous, anyway) and she's too prissy to just sit down somewhere else. Wants somebody to take care of it for her. The room fits with her clothes - maroon velvet couch, overstuffed, similar chairs, quaint little floor lamp with fringe, pictures of scenery on the walls.] "Me in fancy satin robe over regular robe" [Did I mean "clothes"? Seems more likely. This satin robe is very incongruous, I don't know why I have it on, especially over regular clothes - it's as if I'm hiding my other clothes with it. It's hanging partly open at first, and I draw it closed while I'm standing here. I'm feeling a little ill at ease.] 
       "men coming in taking over - sinister" [Don't know how many, but several, in suits like Forties gangsters - they just sort of walked into the house quietly and took over, I don't know what for - there's been no violence or overt threats, but I know they're up to no good. They're waiting for something, maybe for somebody else to come.] "milk out of refrigerator - didn't know there, put back in, they'd bought more, lots to drink, offer to men - old dinette in corner of little kitchen" [I'm in the kitchen, it's a tiny one, with a little dinette set with red flowered plastic upholstery all the way in the corner up against the windows, there are several, bright sunshine, yard outside, corner is in the front of the house, looks out on the street. Near the dinette set is a small refrigerator and some boxes, or wood cartons like Coke boxes. I'm right there and spot the milk behind some of the boxes, not hidden but accidentally left out of sight. I go to put it back in the refrigerator and find somebody's bought more in the meantime and it'll be ded if I put this in - since there's so much I figure we might as well drink it and I offer it to the men.

John Boats is doing a children's Training, for fairly small kids, 5 or 6 maybe - it's not the first, there've been several, but it's still pretty new - taking place in an old building, maybe it was a school but hasn't been used in a while - pretty rough but still homey enough to suit me. Several rooms, mostly small, wood floors, not much furniture. Besides me, I only know about one other person who's here right now, a girl (blonde, medium curly hair) who's leading the kids in a sort of Pied Piper business - that's what she's supposed to be doing, why I don't know, but there's supposed to be music and the stereo's broken, so she's got headphones on so she hears it and parades around to it, and the kids follow. The whole business is sort of low-budget, what with the building and furnishings and all - it's sort of do-the-best-you-can time. I think John is slightly embarrassed about it (but only slightly). Oh, Linda Thomas is here, too - I think some others are now as well - and she's reminding me of the time - it's late afternoon on Sunday, and she reminds me I have a "Tuesday night class" (to teach). I do think it odd to have a Tuesday class on Sunday and I'm confused for a minute. But the main thing is I'm tired. I turn in the doorway toward John and lean heavily against it - he says, "Tired?" and I just nod, then say yes, indeed, or something - I really am exhausted - I'm just doing so much, one thing after another. I don't know if I can keep this up. I'm coming inside a building - church-y, school-y sort of place; elsewhere in it is a kind of pageant going on, with a bunch of people dressed up in Arabian sort of gear, an "emir" sort of head man, underlings and handmaidens, drapes - everything's in orange tones with gold embroidery and that. There's no audience, everybody in the room does something in it. It's almost but not quite real, actually. I'm supposed to be subbing for Ella, who can't make it for her part. I don't know anything about it but I understand you can fake it. I'm dressed in a sort of harem costume, all covered but you can still see how I sort of fall out of it, and Kora is with me giving me a lecture on how I'm getting fatter - "Just look at yourself", he says, "Do you realize how much you've gained from a year ago?" "You've got to stop this eating so much." I'm a little down, but I still don't think it's all that bad, is it? (460 words)

Another bus ride, out on the edge of downtown on a dumpy little road with shacks - actually I'm with a group of women and we're waiting for a bus, or going to one, and we see a little house with a porch and a lot of clothes for sale - advertised as "Amish" [though I'm sure they wouldn't be], with lots of embroidery on cotton gauze. Nice but dubious - I'm encouraging us to go on, we need to catch our bus. Later: after a King's Feast, it's dark, lots of people I know there including Jimmy and Amanda, plus Peter Lawford and Elizabeth Taylor. Everybody's pretty drunk and leaving one by one but not going but just outside the gates and flopping on some benches to rest up. Even the serving-people are drunk. I'm hanging out with Peter Lawford; we're giggling and joking - he's still got a bit of wine in a little glass, and somebody else has a bit in a same-size glass but it's got a top like a lily with petals. Makes it hard to drink out of. I try it myself and you can't quite get it all in your mouth and it dribbles. Funny. I drunkenly remark "Hey Peter, look! Do you know we're the only ones here except for Elizabeth Taylor and...this young man?" ("This young man" is one of the serving-men, but I've forgotten his name. I'm concerned about that because I know him from somewhere else and I think his feelings will be hurt.) We shortly make our way outside - the night is quite pretty, clear, stars out, and we're all relaxing and being quite companionable. I sit down between Amanda and Jimmy, telling them to move over. Everybody's out here; the serving-people have all changed clothes now - there's Griff, sitting on a bit of fence; they're all seeing us off, sort of, watching out that we leave safely. (317 words)

Thanksgiving or Christmas, going to my parents' house - I've got long hair and a hair-spray-glitter can and I use quite a lot of it - somewhere in a small town, with nice little brick buildings - somebody wants to shoot somebody else - I've just parked my car and he's parked behind me, we're at the curb immediately behind a store-sort-of building (short, flat, like a 7-11) and it looks like he's gonna go looking for the person to shoot. I believe I'll just get out of his way. [Somebody somewhere admires my hair and I tell her she can do the same thing with a can of glitter.] In my parents' house, my brother and my father are out doing something [like getting a Christmas tree] and my mom's pissed off about it.

I'm travelling with a family - mother, father, teenage son and 3 or 4 younger kids, and a couple that's maybe his sister and her husband. We're going somewhere, and the name Lawrence, Kansas, comes up, but maybe it's only a stop. There's a lot of disagreement about the direction to take: we've been looking at the map and the father wants to go kinda straight north and visit somebody we know, but the brother-in-law says there isn't any connecting highway and he doesn't want to leave the road we've been on. He wants to leave the group; it isn't necessary that we stay together, but the father is doing his best to convince him to stay. While they're arguing, I have a look at the map myself. It does look a lot like this northern road just goes straight up and stops, but if you follow it back down a bit you can see an intersection with a big highway that will work just fine for us. So it's ok. The map I'm looking at is white, instead of being a standard one. The place we are, if it's a hotel, is kind of old and we seem to be sort of camped out in a long hallway instead of in rooms. Or it's like a gallery - there are windows open, showing daylight and a view of the town and treetops - we're upstairs - and we have our luggage around. I've sort of made sandwiches for everybody, but ran out of filling and there's bread left over. Also not everybody's eating the bread and I'm gathering it back up in case we need it later. At the other end of the hall the kids are playing, a little noisy. The older son is sort of babysitter. There's one very little kid; she's playing on the floor and has crawled into a tote bag with those strap handles and is puttering about like a windup toy. The son laughs. It is pretty cute. So we make it to this town we want to visit - there's a house where a friend of the family is working as a live-in housekeeper for a young executive - she left our home town to come here and we haven't seen her in a good while. This place keeps her busy, all right - the guy's not mean but he's demanding in that absent way that a lot of yuppies get - don't know any other way to get what they want, very regimented existence. She's a little harried, trying to keep up with him. (She's black, reminds me of a young Pearl Bailey but not a comedian.) I go to see this guy where he works - he's just about as harried as she is, trying to keep up with the demands of his bosses - they've got everything all laid out for their people. The executives get free groceries. There's a small grocery store right here on the office compound. (It's not a high-rise.) But there's not enough time for them to let everybody do their shopping when they want to, or something - they have this regimented, too. All these executives get 5-minute shopping sprees (once a day? I guess) - there's a guard with a gate and he has the schedule. I'm going along with our boy to help him out, but once I get in I get hampered by something and can't get hold of what I want. I look around for the guy and he's already gone. (Geez these guys can't help themselves, can they? Everything has to be done in a hurry.) I take what I do have and go back to the gate. There's a bottle of Canoe on the floor in my way - I assume it's been dropped by somebody and I kick it to one side. As I go through the gate, the guard says that that's the bottle of Canoe that was stolen the last time I came through here. Since I haven't even been in this town before, I assume he was talking to somebody else or some other error. I look at him but keep going on my way. It does occur to me that he was fishing - he's trying to nail a shoplifting charge on me. Why? Nobody's stopped me so far, but I'm beginning to wonder if he isn't maybe going to sick the cops on me. Geez. I go back around to this executive's office. I thought he was getting extra groceries for the visitors at his house, but when I go by I can see a lot of people sitting down to dinner in his office. It's got big glass windows - the interior reminds me of the old Peabody's. I'm not dressed up like they are, I guess I better go on back to his house and not interrupt his dinner party. (820 words)

I'm in an elevator lobby - looks like a hotel but it's a lot like a department store, too, and it's really the library - where I work. There's a bunch of doors, but the regular elevators aren't coming and I get on this one off to the side, that was a temporary installation for a special event. All the place is pretty elegant, even this "extra" one, but this one is a bit flimsy. When I get to the floor it's as if the walls don't go all the way up, like a screen. The building has a lot more floors but this elevator goes only from 1-5. Apparently they aren't used as much. It has a bend in it for some reason, for a minute I think I can get out the back opening, but I can't. I go out the front. This may not be the floor I work on, but I know the people here. I'm turning to go to the office, and here come two great big black panthers. They're behaving a lot like guard dogs, checking me out. I'm scared, but not big scared, since they're not attacking. I'm pretty sure they will if I do the wrong thing, though, and I'm anxious to get away from them. I carefully sidle away - they lose interest and go over to a counter, around the corner from the bank of elevators, and investigate a very small child. The kid is snatched up quickly. I'm thinking maybe guard-panthers is not such a good idea, people will complain. I go find the office, and talk to Sherry for a bit. I see a flyer for a music festival. It sounds really neat - I tell Sherry I'd really like to do this. She says her whole office is going, it's a big party of theirs. I only just came back from there but I don't know why I shouldn't go back this soon if I want to. I'm very excited. I tell Sherry how I liked the place and want to go too and she says sure come along. I'm stopping to visit at a house; I have a companion but I don't know who he is. The house is a nice little frame one where a man lives with his daughter. They offer me a bit of a cake that came in a box with a cellophane window on the lid. It's not big and it's not all that good but I keep going back for more. I sneak other little bites and finally cut off a big chunk and butter it. Then I figure I better have 2, so I take another and start to hide it in my jacket. Then I realize how little of the cake is left, and they've got hardly any for themselves and they'll certainly know where it went. But I don't want to put any back. I guess I will, though, but I may not have the opportunity. I'm getting ready to go somewhere, that's why I wanted the cake for later. I go and come back. The guy I'm travelling with is outside trying to turn the van (or car) around in the driveway - having trouble. He says the man in the house just up and died, so he couldn't help. I'm quite surprised. The guy wasn't all that old. He says he just keeled over. It crosses my mind that we'll probably be left something of his property because we were there when he died. (589 words)

I'm with a group of people, which includes my brother, but these others are a family of their own and I don't know them very well. We're in a house or an old hotel. We're supposed to be leaving and they're not packing up to go. I've already cleaned out my room and I'm pissed off because they're not ready. I've waited and waited and this isn't the only thing I'm not happy about. I decide to stomp off on my own. I go on out and down the street. There are young punk kids around, not too sleazy, some of whom look me over and that, and I just stick my nose in the air and keep on going. Shortly I remember I haven't got my luggage with me (or at least something important I have to go back for) and I turn around. The street is kind of residential, kind of not, one of those old streets in a city that aren't popular anymore, a little tired. Some brick buildings. I go back and look for my stuff. I have to step over things to pick it up - it's next to a small table, there's other baggage, electrical cords, and so on. The others are still lounging. This man, may be the "father" of this family, but I don't think so, is not a bad guy, but neither is he the most respectable person around - he makes smart remarks and tries to be superior. He says something to me, and calls me "Monopoly", which I resent - he apparently thinks it's funny - they all think I'm funny, of course, since I'm serious about my business and stick to the program and things like that. This time I've had enough, and I say to him, "I want you to stop calling me 'Monopoly' - it's not my name; it never has been." He looks a little taken aback but maybe he'll stop. "I was only being friendly", of course. I go into another room where a man is still shaving - I'm looking for something, I checked my room but it wasn't there. This guy also has a real nonchalant attitude, but he's nicer than the other. Something hurts me now [can't say what - it isn't coming back to me now] and the guy says he can help. He gets a pencil that's a combination of red and blue lead and shows me, you have to get it quite soft (and the colors blend together) - rubbing it with his thumb on the end. Then he draws with it on my face. Presses down firmly and I can tell he's leaving a mark on my face but he says it'll help. I guess it does. Afterward, when some other people come into the room, I look into the mirror, and I see he's drawn it across my upper lip and down both sides, like a handlebar mustache and the colors mixed to become brown. I wonder if he did that on purpose as a joke. 
       Later, at my grandfather's house: I've come with some people (those others above?) to the street where my grandparents used to live and seen that it's changed a lot. There's a kind of upscale look to the neighborhood and there's a small lake behind some of the houses. I go sit on the back step and see that the lake is right up next to the yard and into it a little. Then I notice with a start that there are buildings in the back yard. No, it's not buildings in it, it's the backs of some condos jutting into the yard. Someone must have sold off part of the back yard and those places are using it crosswise as their back yard. I'm sorry - the end of an era and all that - it's not as nice as it used to be - all this artificial fun (the lake, boats, and all) and artificial class (the condos). Then I'm in my bedroom waiting for Lori. I hear flute music and it gets louder and I realize it must be her, coming up the stairs, though I can't hear the steps creak. I didn't know she'd learned to play the flute (or pipes) and wonder if she'd just learned and I figure she's playing them up the stairs to announce her arrival, like Lyn does. I'm going into the living room to let her in, and I can just see her head and shoulders through the window - she's wearing a cloak with hood, which is up - she looks different. But the music doesn't seem to be coming from outside and I look around. Then I can't see Lori any more - I can't see anybody outside. That bothers me, and I go to draw the curtains. They have drawstrings now, but I can't get them to work. I can't get one to go across without the other. The music is still going on. (826 words)

Barbara and I are travelling somewhere and get stuck or stranded in some rain, and when it's over we go up to the highway and try to walk across. Only it's muddy. We're both dressed pretty nice but it just doesn't matter any more and we go on anyway. When we step out we find it's muddier than we thought and sink a bit. Then more. Then a whole lot more, and suddenly we're up to our chests and flailing for the curb. We make it there and need help getting up over it. We hang on and yell for help - there isn't a road shoulder but a drop-off with some steps, down to the service road. And some people down below. A guy comes up to help us; somebody else helps him, they haul us up over the curb and down to the street. Then he asks us for money. We're very surprised and insulted. I give him a traveller's check, without much grace, and we go on off down the road. As we turn a corner around a store, I realize I only just handed him the check from the pack, I didn't sign it; it won't be any good. I think that's fine - we'll just disappear and he can't find us. I start hurrying, but he catches up and I have to make it good. We need a place to stay - he takes us down the street to a house where an older couple live, maybe a bed and breakfast sort of place, but there's nobody awake. He takes us in anyway, and we look around. I look in the mirror at myself and find I'm not actually covered in mud. Messy, damp, but not mud-coated. (292 words)

Somewhere, in a place like the Administrative Wing, there's an office like Mr Slaughter's or Jan's - beyond it is an open space. All the walls and panels are a medium dark peach. The lighting is indirect and down some. Seems like night. I'm looking into this "office" - which is bigger than usual - and there's a large incubator-type thing in it. I can see it has something alive and furry in it so I go look. There are actually 3 human babies in it, all asleep, and 3 huge guinea pigs, and some large hamsters. Somebody has told me to go look at the hamsters, but didn't mention the babies. I consider that odd. It seems to be some kind of experiment.I'm in a house with a young girl. I'm visiting, I don't know anybody here very well. Seems like she has a younger sister. We are going somewhere, and next door stop at a little house with bushes out front that have candy bars on them. She's looking over one and I see she's got a Violet Crumble in her hand. I'm delighted and start looking for one of my own. I'm listening to a girl whine at me, everything's wrong with her and her life, etc. As she turns to me, I see a crystal. I guess she'd been wearing it but I see it separately. It's clear but has green inside it and another color outside - maybe part of the setting, another stone. It has a silver cap on it. (256 words)

I'm at Sue S's house, helping get ready for a Training - it's also the Center. We've had our meeting and cleaning up but people keep coming for other things. The room has been set before but changed - by Sue and somebody, I think - now it's not all straight but nearly. I'm looking in a corner at a small tree and there's a bit of branch with some root attached I want to throw out but, it's attached to the other root system and I'm not sure I should. I try to find somebody to ask and they're all too busy. I see a mother and her 2 daughters have come - both girls dressed in green jumpers, white blouses, school uniforms - Oxfords - one girl has red hair. They're being taught to use the phone. I'm kinda pissed off because I can't get my questions answered, but the branch has come loose from the rest anyway. I put it down and go into the living room. I know this room is usually lived-in and not part of the Center, but sometimes it's used. I go to the front door - maybe just to see, but I think I open it at a knock, somebody comes in. I'm on the porch, and suddenly I'm swept off my feet by somebody. Turns out to be Dan, who doesn't do that sort of thing. I get crushed and carried back to the classroom. We lie down facing each other, propped on elbows - he's elated, so happy and excited he could burst. I notice he's wearing a skirt - a jeans-type skirt, I wonder if it's some new fashion for men, when I see he's wearing a blonde curly wig. I ask him if anybody knows he's dressed like that - he says no, this is the first time - and he's going to dress like this on his camping trip with Lynn, and sleep in a "funereal" box. I let that pass for a moment and then say, "Dan did you mean to say 'funereal' box or [something else that rhymes, but it's not coming to me now]?" He looks taken aback and says "I thought I said [__} - gee, they sure do sound alike, don't they?" Silence for a while. Then Mark crosses my mind, and I think of AIDS, and I ask Dan if he ever... and he says no. I'm relieved but still worried and unsure. I'm driving a car with Lou in the front seat and Garrett in the back, coming up to a place downtown that you have to turn left or right. I get in the lane to turn left. Luis is getting out here and abruptly leaves without saying goodbye or anything. I remark on this to Gail, and turn left. (461 words)

I'm travelling with a girlfriend who wants to find her mother (or her mother's grave - I think she knows she's dead). Also with us is Bill , and we're like detectives or something, though not partners, and we're going along to help her. I don't know where we started from exactly but one place we were was an amusement park and I was coming away from it, going toward the place I'll meet the others, on a residential street that's very muddy (or something that makes it difficult to cross). I want to have a look at this house although it's on the wrong side of the street, and it takes me a while to get there. I don't want anyone to see me looking, so I just look carefully and turn to go. Either I drop something or I'm afraid of dropping something here because I don't want to delay and possibly get caught here. No big deal, actually, I'm not doing anything wrong, but I'm uncomfortable about it. Anyway I get back across the street. Later we're in a motel room. Morgan's been doing things in the bathroom and the friend has gotten groceries. I've been thinking about our plan and waiting for Bill so I can get in the bathroom. When he does come out, I go in and see this odd sink and quite a lot of toiletries of Morgan's all over, and the "porcelain" (it's that molded stuff) wants rinsing off. The sink actually goes up behind the taps, and rises to a shelf to put things on, but it's slanted. I wonder how his bottles and things are staying up. Then, to rinse the sink, I splash water up there and find it flows neatly along the shelf and down. It's made to do that. Oh. And when I move a bottle or two and put them back, I see there's an air-suction slot in the wall behind. At first I thought all these things had magnets on, but they're being held by the air suction. I can feel it when I put my hand up there. Anyway I askMorgan if we're gonna plan our next move and he seems reluctant. Doesn't have any ideas and doesn't feel well, apparently, his main goal is to take care of himself. Later we're at a place outdoors with a bunch of other people, around a place like an open barn (or my px's old garage on Rosedale) and there's supposed to be a wedding but either it's been called off or postponed. It's more like a carnival, these people are just milling around. The reason we're here is we're trying to find someone who knows this girl's mother, (Shelley?). We're really just passing by. (Like "Route 66".) There was a wedding cake made in the size and shape of a wedding dress, only most of the cake's already been eaten. You can open up the outer icing like the "dress" it's meant to be, and get cake from inside. Nobody wanted to disturb the pretty outside. I go up to see if I can get a taste and a girl (blonde - the real bride?) says, there's some cake left (in such and such a place) - just look for it. Really I only do want a taste and I pinch a little bit of remnant from inside and find it's really pretty bland for a wedding cake. I surely don't want a whole piece. I go back to my friends, and the girl's been putting up pieces of zucchini on a board with magnets - like a display - several of them - just to amuse herself, I guess. The zucchini is cut long-ways, not sliced from the end. The people mill around, mostly saying "what's this for?" One guy, a regular loudmouth, sort of takes over and makes a show of doing something to destroy the zucchini - burning them, I guess. He's got everybody's attention, and they're all crowding around him to see what he's doing. My friend is quite hacked off and yells at him he'd better not do that or be prepared to replace her magnets. (696 words)

I am working in my office but it looks different, and there's other stuff going on. Mick Jagger is working there now, and it's set up more circular. I'm going off to look for Lori, and the place is also a shopping mall. Didn't find her but I poke around in a toy store. Back to office. There's a wedding going on in a big room nearby. Polish or something - there are a lot of people in there. There's something I need to get - a plain white envelope - and after I look around I find they must be in the room where the wedding's going on, so I go through to the back of it past all these people. I'm very self-conscious, esp. since I don't have shoes on, and realize the staff is really supposed to stay out, and leave the people alone. But I get my envelopes and leave. A salesman comes by with some stationery products, starting his spiel as though I were the Purchaser - I explain to him that I'm not - I only talked to him when he was here before because I was interested in Christmas cards, but I didn't send any after all. He's a stocky short guy, foreign, dark, sort of prim, and he's a bit miffed now. He looks like he thinks I'm giving him the runaround, but I'm not. He leaves some cards with me to give to Linda. Mick Jagger comes over to say something. He's really quite a normal sort of guy, doesn't fool around. Not too much anyway - he's fun. However, I'm getting ready to move out of town. Next I'm in a house with my father and stepmother and brother and another girl. (My sister? - don't think so.) I'm probably a teenager. We've just moved in and don't know where things are, haven't got the furniture all in. Nice little old house. I go over where this closet is. It has a big chest of drawers affair in it, not wood, with a bin-opening at the top. It's tall. As I look at it, it moves a little, I see it's on wheels. I pull it out and find a real chest of drawers behind it, old, wood, painted white. I exclaim over this to my brother and what's-her-name, because now we've got plenty of drawer space. [Somehow I get a message - don't know if it's through the mail or I go outside the house or what, something unusual about it.] I get a letter that says the writer's coming to visit soon, and in a tacked-on note, Maxine too. But it's not signed and we're having to speculate who sent it. I figure it's Ted. He said he'd visit, but why Maxine? Why would she want to come out here? (447 words)

I keep seeing this guy around - he's pretty good-looking, seems nice, not flashy or even very outgoing, probably younger than me - we go to the same school or work in the same place, I'm not sure - I notice him a lot but I don't ever speak, we haven't actually met - and now he's sitting next to me in a movie theater. I'm with some other people but I'm pretty distracted by him. I think he's with other people too but not with a girl. I get more agitated as time goes on, and very late in the movie he turns his head towards me, leans over very slowly and kisses me. Suddenly I know he's noticed me too, and is as attracted to me as I am to him. I'm shocked, but I turn my head to him and kiss him back, on the lips. I really want him. My feelings are very strong. I don't know if anything is ever spoken, and I soon leave with my female friends; I don't know if he comes with me or not. Later I'm in an auditorium at work, with a short bank of seats with 2 aisles - the seats rise to high windows across that let in sunlight. There are 2 riser-affairs on each outside bank of seats at the front inside corners. They're for speakers to stand on, from the audience I presume, and they're just boxes of wood painted blue with a platform in the center. [The front of the room is presumably open, as a lecture hall or something, but it doesn't figure into this dream.] Some people have just left and I'm one of the last out. As I look at the riser nearest the door, I can see that it sags in the middle and looks worn. I call someone back from the door to look at it, and we agree it is pretty tacky, possibly dangerous, and we really must do something about it. ---Almost forgot, some small children were here, at least one of them stood on the riser and spoke.

I'm in a small place, an apartment or motel room, where I'm staying with my mom and [somebody else - a brother or 2?]. A very abbreviated place, small rooms and flimsy fixtures, like the Motel 6 was. It has a kitchen. There's a telephone on the wall next to the kitchen. It hangs sideways and has a round earpiece and the mouthpiece is sort of the end of the metal rod that you hold. You can't prop it on your shoulder. Mom's not here. Somebody else comes in, a boy (we're all young here) with some clay figures to show us. He takes them out of plastic bags. He hands me a sort of rabbit-lady, and I quite like it, but it's still a bit soft and some of it comes apart in my hand. I'm afraid if I grasp it with my other hand I'll smush it. Or if I put it down. I feel terribly responsible for it. Nobody else is paying attention yet, he's showing others to my brother and I'm sitting there, very uncomfortable, and I would really like to get up and go do something else. Finally I get tired of waiting and I put it down. It does bend a bit but it's ok. (205 words)

I'm in a car in a residential neighborhood, being chased by another car, don't know who's in it. I have a kitten with me. We turn and dash down the blocks and I finally lose the other car by dashing into a driveway. This is the back yard of a very nice house and the man who lives there is outside. I get out and explain what I'm doing there and he's very nice and accommodating, says sure I can stay. He has a cat too and we talk about cats. The kitten comes out and looks around; I fetch a box-thing like the plastic airline carriers and put him in while we're talking. It's not just a carrier but a port-a-potty for cats, and he takes a very long pee. I'm not exactly embarrassed, but concerned lest I spill it and make a mess on this man's things. I do get jostled a bit but there isn't any actual harm done. I take the bucket out and empty it, put it back in and the kitten pees some more but not so much. Next: I'm (staying) at a sort of resort-place. There's a row of rooms, all a wood building with a board walkway in front with a roof. A bit like a Western sort of town. Barbara's also staying here, not far from me, I'm outside on the walk and I pass by where Barbara is and I overhear her say something about some earrings I gave her, little gold chains (the sort that just look like a loop of chain hanging through the ear). I don't remember her exact words but she wanted to exchange them for something somebody else had, since she never wore them. I'm rather disappointed. She never said anything to me. I feel slighted and I want to do something to get back at her. I go back down toward my room and I'm outside on the walkway and Barbara comes back down this way. She's actually quite cool to me and her voice is sharp. I'm thinking of something she gave me that I can give away or trade. Next: I'm on a beach with somebody else down below a house where we stay. We've both got robes on, not bathrobe-standard but monk-y-looking, though they are for leisure or beachwear. Long sleeves. We're sitting after walking, looking out at the roaring morning sea, contemplating. This is an old guy, my teacher. We've sat there for a long time and the sun's coming up and I'm getting warm. I get up and go up to the house where there's a couple of other people on the porch. They're standing and looking out, too, but mostly watching us. I exchange my long-sleeved robe for a short-sleeved one and go back down to join the old man. (It's got something to do with work.) I'm in my office - nothing like the real one, it's all closed in - yellow light, a bit crowded. Kelly works here part-time but she's looking for another job. She and her boyfriend are eating spaghetti or something at the corner of a table or desk. I'm hungry. Her boyfriend offers me a bite or 2 from his plate and I make a mess, stuff on the table, but not too bad. I gasp. Kelly thinks it's worse than it is, but then we see. She's trying to encourage me to get something done - says, you know I'm going away soon, and then you'll have to do it on your own. Someone comes in asking if there's any cake left - I didn't realize there was any, though I've been sitting right next to it. Also chocolate cookies - ones with chips, little all-chocolate ones, some big flat ones with chocolate stripes. And Mexican cake, loaf-type slices, stacked up. Some pink ones across from me where the cookies are, white ones on my right. I don't know what we do here but there are drawing-boards as well as desks. (670 words)

I'm with a couple of other people at a crafts show - part of it's outside, part in. Inside I'm looking at some neat jewellery, some I've seen before or at least the same artists. It's darkish here, and there's a big glass case that's very low to the ground, and faces the back wall - don't know what's in front of me. There's an old man comes up, he's delighted with something I did for him [I don't remember what] and thanks me at great length. He's the father of one of the women I'm with and I don't want to upset anybody by asking him to go away. He's [either wearing or has, on his hat] a silver piece, an Art Nouveau woman's head, I think, set in ribbon or something, very pretty, and I admire it, mentioning it to the lady whose booth it is, telling her (since I can't get a word in edgewise with the old man) I have one just like it at home, except his is silver and mine's pewter, without the frills. It came from her shop, she's pleased. He goes away and I look around some more, especially the lighted case where there are loose stones at the bottom. I sit on the floor to look and open the door. (I look up once to see if anybody minds.) It's a sliding glass door with no lock. There are very interesting rocks in here, especially some that remind me of scarabs but aren't quite. There are some brown variegated ones that I hold up to my ears, and look in the mirror. The bigger pieces sit out by themselves and the little ones are in dishes. Someone wants to show me a couple of articles in a box, a green box. One of them is leather with hide still on it and for a second I don't know what it is, then I realize it goes round the neck; first I think it buttons or snaps, then I see it slips on over the head. It's a kind of bib-collar affair, meant for keeping your neck and chest and shoulders warm and the chill out. Very Eskimo-y looking, has a nice woven design on, I like it a lot. Somebody says something about the funny things people get themselves up in, and I say, "Consider that there was a time when there were no coats - people used to wear cloaks, you know - that was how you kept yourself warm." I am admiring the collar in the mirror. I like it a lot. We go to a place outside now, I take off the collar. There are a lot of people out here milling around rather like a cocktail party or Sunday after church - not actually looking at things. There's a mirror hanging up on the fence or back of a building and we try things on and look at ourselves. The girl who has the stuff here wants to show me a shawl, she says it's the last one of its group, a specialty thing she did, she thinks I should try it on. She pulls it out and I walk to the mirror with it, looking for the tag and when I see what I think is the price I'm astounded - does it really say $1295? (Actually it has a British pound sign written above it but it's just that affectation.)* It certainly is nice, but not that nice. I open it out and try to pull it straight behind me so as to wrap it around but it keeps getting out of my grip, so as I walk I seem to be flying it out behind me like a flag. Which is okay with me, I feel quite flamboyant. I see in the faces milling around a particular man that I like the looks of - he seems very sharp-dressed, handsome, interesting. Suits me to be noticeable. I go to the mirror, flinging the shawl around me dashingly. I see it's definitely brown and white (looks like an overgrown version of the alpaca scarf Melanie made me), and it goes rather well with the heavy sweater that I can now see I'm wearing. I like it.

I seem to be living with Ralph and his wife in a house or small cabin and they're/we're moving out. Somebody else is helping too. There are also some little reptilian creatures living here, too, and they're just babies - 2 different kinds, one's a dragon, the other's sort of round-headed, there's only 2 or 3 of them. You have to watch them like a hawk, or they'll run around and the neighborhood kids'll grab them to play with and they think it's fun to throw them up in the air and try to make them fly. They don't fly. This is terrible. I run out and scream at the kids and they leave. Now Ralph (he's wearing his "coonskin" cap and funny jacket) has discovered somebody's stolen the television set from the bedroom. He's real upset about it, everybody is. We go on moving things. The others are outside and I'm in the front room - it's empty mostly. Ralph comes out of the bedroom looking dejected and sits heavily on a box or trunk next to the door, puts his hands on his knees. Looks defeated. I tell him he's lucky they didn't take anything else, look how much he still has. He cheers up a little, when I hear a call that the kids have the babies again and we go running out. It's terrible. This is kind of a park we're in, the day isn't bright but not overcast, the grass isn't green but not brown, nothing much to be seen, sort of blah lawns. The kids are on the side of the house, throwing the baby animals up, and they're in such sad shape, and I'm really angry - I mean to put a stop to this. One or two of the round-headed ones may be dead, I don't want to look at them, I'm scared. I snatch up a couple under each arm, the others do the same, and make for one of the kids. They're boys, maybe 10 or 12 years old. Cruel. Thoughtless. Mean. Nasty. I'm horrified and furious. (347 words)

Before: I'm in a theater where a show is on and Tom Bell/Dr Who is the main character - it's maybe a magic show, or something where he interacts with the audience. Theater is small, sort of Victorian, seats run steep, velvet curtains and seat covers. I'm chosen out of the audience (jam-packed, full of kids or otherwise very enthusiastic, active people) to do something (call it a stunt) that has to do with me having something and he chases me to get it. I get to hide first and then run. I go behind the stage: I go up a few little steps in front of me - I'm sitting close to the front, 2nd row, right end - and when I go through the door I see there's an outside door to the street, also open. It's night. I wait my chance, going to the edge of the curtain and peering around, then when the time is right I dash quietly across the stage and sneak up on him (to the delight of the audience). Then I lead him a merry chase, finishing up by disappearing behind the crowd to the right, running down to the front and across to the middle aisle, then back up my own row to my seat. Everybody loves it. Most people don't use that much imagination in this "event". The Doctor is foiled, everybody roars. As I sit, I think about how I might have just dashed out the door and run down the street, that would've been fun. But I'd have had to leave my purse and library book behind. The book I could have trusted to get back but I didn't want to leave my purse. [By the way, the scene outside is an empty little street like you might like to see behind a little Victorian theater, and it's been raining, so the lamplight shines on wet streets. There are some trees and bushes, mostly the other side of the street.] 
       Another scene: a man is encouraging me to try clothes on, so I can go to some fancy ball or do. I have got absolutely nothing to wear for it, and I absolutely refuse to consider going in the things he's proposing. I will not - as he suggests - put on these 2 old-fashioned, granny-type long-sleeved cotton dresses and "somehow" combine them. (350 words)

Trying to get to work. It's still dark and I want some breakfast - I'm not all dressed yet, not sure what I've got on top but I've got something casual underneath. I live a few blocks away but I've come to this roadhouse-diner for breakfast but can't go in yet - I run into this girlfriend, she's supposed to be going with me but she says she has a job at last - working in this fancy dress shop she used to work in. She hadn't wanted to do that, but she needs the money bad. She wanted to improve her career. I'm wondering how she'll fare in that place, it's quite classy and she's rather informal - earthy, even. She's not absolutely thrilled with the job herself but she is excited and relieved. I guess it's understandable. Anyway, I'm spending too much time here talking - I need to get on. It's getting late for breakfast and I'll just get something to go, but first I'll look at this house trailer over here in the parking lot - I'm going to be living in it soon, and I've got the keys with me. It has 2 locks in the door (which opens out the back end) and usually the locks will catch when you shut the door hard but I'm having trouble with it. I've seen inside, it's nice enough, a small but comfortable living room. Now the locks won't catch. I twiddle keys and bang the door over and over - nothing. Damn. There's a cat around, he comes over and wants to stand around and try to get inside - I have to keep dragging him or his tail out of the door so I can bang it. Nothing is happening with the locks, I think they're broken. Somebody from the diner comes by to sympathize. Now I know I'm going to be late for work and I can't even go home to change clothes without being later. I take off my robe or whatever it is and I've got on a plaid long-sleeved shirt and khaki pants. That ought to be good enough for work but I don't think it is. If only I had a jacket! And now I sure don't get any breakfast. I'm really frustrated and disappointed now. Getting angry. If a bus came by just now I'd be obliged to take it but I'm not confident about going to work dressed like this and I think I'll go home and change even if it is 8.15. I start for home - I have to go down the street to the left for a bit, then turn left. [Didn't I come in a car? - seems like it.] I'm walking first, then I walk faster, then break into a little jog - I'm not getting the hang of it at first, then it settles down and I run. I'm in a residential neighborhood with lots of trees, tall ones with overhanging leaves making a bit of roof. After a bit I come to a bunch of girls just getting off a bus. They start into the street to walk home, and get in my way. At first I slow down meaning to let them pass, but they don't. They stay in my way and they're walking slowly. I jog in place a bit, then speed up and try to find a hole to get through, but when I try to dart past somebody moves and I run into her. This happens once or twice more and I get impolite and start shoving. They take exception, of course. And I feel a little guilty and nasty but I run on ahead anyway, hoping to leave them out of sight. I don't quite make it and want to get away, so I turn left down a side street. It's got some tall red brick apartments on it - it's starting to get light, too. Somehow I get into a place - an apartment, I guess, though not mine, and I don't remember climbing any stairs, but there are two women here - dressed like suburban housewives, they don't mind me being here - maybe people take shortcuts here a lot. There's a window with a fire escape to my right, I'll go out that and double back so those girls in the street won't see me. There's a little old woman, bent over, dressed sorta like a gypsy, with long stringy black-and-grey hair in the way, though, and she even goes out to the fire-escape landing. Again I have to get round her to get down. Geez. But I do get there and start to go down but there aren't real steps, it's more like a very high jungle-gym and I have to climb down through the center. It's tricky, reaching from platform to platform. Scary. As I go down, suddenly I see there are other people around, on the jungle-gym and out of it. They're dressed in long things, and I finally see they're SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM people. They must be here for a demonstration or small tournament or something. A girl on the jungle-gym speaks to me and they all seem to think I'm one of them and expect me to join them. I'm taken aback, this is rather Twilight-Zone-y. This is a bizarre situation. (884 words)

I've just come back from somewhere and found that "we" have been taken over. ("We", I guess, means the whole country, and by Russia, looks like.) There's not many people around and some of them are in groups in houses packing up to leave. There are some poor people at my house with my parents [not my real ones], they've taken them in and we're going off together. (Don't know where to.) This poor woman is sitting like a statue while my mother is folding blankets. She has a ragged white one herself and mother takes it last, folds it, adds it to the bundle. I understand what's happened but I'm not taking much of a hand myself. Finally I ask my mother, by the way, I haven't heard yet, are we taking any of our own things? Like clothes, you know - are we just going with what we've got on or are we packing a suitcase or something? You know all my Units pack flat, though I'd hate to have to leave some of the other stuff, I'd be well enough off with those. (183 words)

It's after such a Russian takeover, and I'm living in a house with the family from "Eight is Enough", as well as other "refugees" or displaced persons or something, we're all very crowded into one house and trying to work things out. It's not easy. For instance, the bathrooms have low stall doors on them and after waiting to get into one, the boy before me wanted to stop and chat and there are always people coming by so it's hard to get enough privacy to pee. The family's very friendly, though - these other people only just came and are just settling in. I come into the bedroom and this friend of mine wants to talk about the coffee arrangements. She and one of the others - a black girl, younger than me - think it's got to be changed. Something about the $7 a month we pay not covering new equipment. I'm not sure what they're talking about and they're taking it awfully seriously. I feel guilty for some reason, as though the problem is my fault, or maybe I should be taking it as seriously as they are. I give the black girl $5 to start off the contributions and they say some more, then I say, okay, please start over, I don't understand yet - I paid $7 before, and I've just given another $5 to you, now tell me why? They start to talk and just at that moment a whole crowd of people comes through the door, all talking animatedly so we can't hear any more and walking in between us. We give it up. Lots of these people are tenants in this room, some of them new. I get to listening to a guy talking about maybe knocking another window in this blank wall so you can see the sun and I tell him I'd been thinking about bringing a bookcase from my old house and putting it there, maybe we should think about it. I leave the room and find the "mother" of the house in the living room, sitting at a desk - I greet her saying, at last I've found you! - and she says she'd wanted to talk to me about my lip color and how I sometimes am overglossed. I say I never wear lipstick and she talks about not liking to wear it, either, and runs over all the same reasons I really don't bother wearing it, it's a waste of effort. She's a nice lady. Short gray hair. Also somewhere in here there's a kids' theatrical being presented outdoors on a sort of plaza, with a bunch of kids in whiteface with bright pastel Indian-paint on their faces and sort of tutu costumes, singing a musical number in formation with lots of arm gestures.

I'm getting dressed in a bedroom (not mine?), standing facing the side of the bed (not mine) with my back to the door. I've got on a rather neat shirt, maybe new, new to me at least, gold-color, not shiny - a sort of basket-weave, with a collar, buttons up to the neck. I look pretty sharp, but I'm supposed to have a black jacket on - my own black jacket - but it's not washed and I can't put it on. It's lying on the bathroom floor [like mine really is] and even if I was willing to wear it dirty, it's crumpled. Besides, it's not really nice any more - it's had most of the color worn or washed off by now and it would detract from the shirt if I did put it on. All the same, I feel rather inadequate without a jacket, underdressed. I'm supposed to be dressed up nice for something that's going on. I'm uncomfortable about it, and hug the shirt around me. I still look pretty classy though. (172 words)

I work for a rock star (Prince?) and am travelling with him and his girlfriend. The auditorium is being set up and I'm not doing anything much when I remember I haven't set out, gotten their clothes for the show. I'm slightly panicked and hurry back to the place we're sort of "encamped". She (the girlfriend) has set up some triangular cardboard boxes as a sort of tunnel into the area and I don't want to crawl through because of my weight, so I have to stumble past them. This place is kind of like a huge warehouse and we're camping in it like little rabbits or something. I go into their "room", where clothes and things are. As I do things I overhear her talking to someone, who says how remarkable it is, she's 8 months pregnant and nobody knows. She wants to keep it a secret. The publicity would be awful, and everything would be very messy. (He's black and she's white - they mean to stay together and be a family but don't think they could have any private life if this got out.) She's quite nervous and dithery about the whole thing - not her usual style - and comes in to hand me something, saying keep it for her. I think I should sort of hide it so she can't find it all that easily and keep getting it again (I don't know what it is - papers? - but I know she's only dithering about it out of nervousness) - I put it behind a lamp on a small table, with something that I just put there myself, but it's kinda precarious so I go to put it in (or near) my suitcase, on the floor by the opposite wall. [This is really a room, sort of - there are outside windows in it but they don't let you see out - frosted, I guess.) I'm repacking it anyway and trying to put a couple of new yellow sweaters in it, I've got several crew-neck sweaters there already, a couple more yellow, a couple beige. They mightn't fit. A little girl comes up and looks over my shoulder, her mom not far behind - she asks the usual questions, what are you doing that for, etc. I mention she has a couple of yellow sweaters like these. (Or does she?) (396 words)

A friend of mine, who lives next door or nearly, is associated with William Shatner in a business capacity - is she an actress too, or something else? - but I saw her with him by accident someplace - out somewhere, maybe, but I think through a window - and they were behaving like sort of "pre-lovers", and I do believe they're striking up a romance. I'm coming back home on the bus and I go by her house. I think I'll go in and ask her about it. She mentions him before I do, and I think either she doesn't want people to know they're seeing each other socially (she's embarrassed about it), or she doesn't realize it herself. (120 words)

There's a Training going on, I'm participating, and John has given us a sort of assignment to complete, which involves getting a load of underpants washed and stacked neatly in a time-period, plus some other details, I think. I go with another girl to her place - there's a rather dark sort of room, study-like, cluttered with things, old carpet on the floor. This is quite comfortable and companionable after the Training environment, but we remember we have a project to do and it's not "supposed" to be easy - we have to keep our business in mind. The laundry basket is on the bed and the panties are in it. (111 words)

I am incarcerated somewhere with Dr Who (Peter Davisson) in a rather futuristic place, as though it were an episode of the show. I don't know how we got here but we didn't do anything wrong, and the Doctor is trying to get us out. They have him change clothes into a sort of prison uniform but it's green and has a turtleneck and matching socks and all. We've got an accomplice, I don't think he came in here with us, but he's helping us. We've managed to get the Doctor's clothes back, or we've found them, and he's changing and talking about what we're going to do when someone comes in. We're across a partition from the door, so we can't necessarily be seen, but the Doctor doesn't hear them and doesn't stop talking. I try to signal him, then whisper, "Doctor!", urgently, but he keeps on talking away and I'm getting scared. If we're caught we're sure to be in big trouble because the Doctor's changed almost everything now, except his shoes and socks, and they'll know what's happening for sure. The Doctor can talk his way out of lots of things, but this would definitely raise the alarm and we didn't want to do that. The plan had been for him to get out and then get me out, after he had some help. Is that right? Or were we all getting out together? Anyway, now he does shut up, and the moment is tense - we're about to be noticed by the men who came in - the first one is a typical bad-guy-in-an-authority-group TV or movie stereotype, and he's talking away to the 2nd, so he hasn't noticed right away. I think the Doctor's going to do some fancy talking and cover for me escaping. (300 words)

I'm at a place that's some kind of institution, and I either work here or am studying here, either way it's where I spend my time. There's a lot of Life Training people here, and yoga people. First I go to a kind of arena, and take my place in the stands near the front. Sue is nearby and we say something to each other, I don't know what's going on out in the arena itself. Shortly it seems to be lunch hour, and everybody breaks up and goes places. All very casual, people just drift away. I stand talking to somebody for a few minutes. Then I'm at a kind of concrete ramp-affair, like you might find in a parking lot. The corner of the ramp goes up and around, and the sides are open from about shoulder height so you see sunlight and trees and all. There are quite a few people about, including Sue, and I tell her about a conversation I just had with somebody, and I tell her his name, which she finds hard to believe, but I insist once or twice,, and then start to say, "You know, the guy who used to work with you", but stop short because I realize that it was Bill Wold instead of who I said after all. I'm embarrassed but amused and I tell Sue I've remembered that the person I'd said was wrong, but I'd tell her later who it was. So I settle down on the floor with a blanket or a mat of some kind, and set it up just under the turn of the ramp where the upper part creates a real deep slant to the lower part, and I'm going to do some exercises. I'm not sure I meant to at first, but after I get settled I just think I'll try sitting up and reaching for the upper-thing, since it's so close. I'm lying so that I'm on a slant, with my head down. So as I reach up, I come up easily enough, hands straight out, but they have to bend soon because of the wall. Then back down again, hard but I can do it. I continue to do this for quite a while, and one or another people come to talk to me, including George, whom I'd rather not see because I don't want him to watch me do this. I'm not doing it to "work out" anyway, but for fun and to see how long I can. George, having seen me do this, decides to set up some kind of an exercise in the vicinity, which involves him being behind a curtain, and the other people laid out in rows that remind me of streets. I at first think I'm taking part in this but am not very enthusiastic. Then I see by the clock (that I never noticed before) that it's 1.10 and my lunch hour's over anyway. I start to pick up my things and go. (501 words)

There's a kind of war or rebellion going on at work, and management has some of the employees working for them, but not many are morally behind them. I'm in a small office - just came there to help or take over for another girl, we're going through some files and sorting things. There's a couple of girls from "the other side" crouched behind a desk across the room shooting arrows at us. We're pretty nonchalant - mostly these people can't hit you for beans, and the risk is small (though present!) so you just do your thing and don't bother about ducking, it's not as though you don't know what they're going to do. The girl I'm with is going through papers on my right, and she says she needs to leave early, there's something she needs to go home for, will I mind taking over for her? I say no, that's fine, I don't have much to do anyway. But this arrow-business is becoming a nuisance, and you know all I really need to do is just go and kick the desk over on 'em - so I do that. Takes a couple of tries but it goes over - it's a regular heavy old gray one, and one of the girls is pinned under it. Don't know if she's hurt or not. The other one comes out from behind and says, look, I hope you don't resent this too much, I'm just doing this because I have to, I don't really want to hurt you. (She has long hair, sort of pretty, "nice" - reminds me of Bailey Quarters.) I say to her, that's okay, actually I'm just worried about the rest of your life. She considers that - yeah, she says, you're right; I don't know if I really want to hurt anybody at all. I say I don't know if I could actually hurt another person myself. (322 words)

I'm under the control of a couple of guys, one blonde, one dark-haired. The blonde is in charge, more or less but the other is his henchman. [I don't know what they want with me but I've been their prisoner not very long, in a house.] They don't have weapons but think I can't resist them. I get hold of a long square stick/pole and brain the darker one with it - he didn't think I could do it and all but laughed at me. It was kind of fun and I sort of want to hit him again but I need to get out before he wakes up. The blonde guy comes with me. We get in a car, back seat, somebody else driving. (106 words)

I'm sitting at a vanity table trying to put on my mascara in a hurry - I thought I'd finished all the makeup but when I went out and saw myself in a mirror I hadn't done it, so I'm here - I do a stroke, and get it on my eyelid. Several spots. I rub one, make a smudge; I don't have my stick or Q-Tips, so I frantically look for something to rub with and it doesn't work very well - I can't get the Kleenex to work. I'm panicking. Finally I go out again. [Kelly's around somewhere.] I'm outside with Lorren and some other people - we're getting ready to go somewhere, we're next to a car. I'm gonna try the mascara again. I'm still nervous - I drop the wand, and juggle it, and it ends up stuck between the armhole of my white sweater-vest and my white shirt. I'm thoroughly overwrought now and just collapse in tears. Nobody knows why I'm so depressed but they're cautious. Somebody leaves, I think, and Lorren and I go back inside. There's somebody else here, 2 men. Some other guys come to take us (all) some place but I just can't go. Lorren stays with me. (204 words)

I've brought Tree, who is elderly and not well, "home" - as if we've been staying out in the country somewhere - as well as 3 baby possums. I'm looking at a picture book of nursery rhymes and (fairy tales, I guess) - it's quite large, with color pictures. The babies and Tree are perched at the top as if they're tucked between pages, and I'm turning them, to find some story with possums in it (or are they foxes?) where the babies can live. And one for Tree, so I can give him a nice home to retire in. I'm trying not to think about that - it's too painful. I don't want to let him go, don't want to send him away. And I say to myself, "he's only 12 years old! He could live a long time yet!" Cats can get to be 16 or older - that's another 4 years, maybe. A couple of other people are with me and we're running from some bad guys, gangsters, in a place like a warehouse, with barrels and bundles in it. They're going to come through the door and it looks like we can't get out but by the time they come through we've got up to the ceiling and through a trapdoor or something into the room above and we're away.

A young man calls me on the phone, he's from the SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM and I've met him casually at an event or party I had once, at some park or school or church or somewhere. He's telling me that we're going to have a visit from a King Estanzia and this is partly an invitation to come, but also he wants to know how or if they can get to use the place I had the party at. I tell him what there is to say about that and ask him who is this Estanzia that I should be so impressed with him - what's he like? what's he done? The guy doesn't answer me, and I rephrase the question, but he still doesn't, and I wonder have I offended him so bad, or has he already hung up, and I just don't realize it? [As I gradually wake up I don't have it in my hand, so I couldn't have been talking to anybody.] (148 words)

I'm working in a courtroom - it's big, open, has lots of people in it, including George - who still teaches yoga too. My job is more or less clinical, but I'm pretty much indispensable - I do all sorts of things and make myself useful. Some of the people here are caricatures - there's a sort of hostile Groucho Marx, and pompous uniformed "official"-types (like from Ruritania or somewhere). Something needs to be solved, or someone needs to be captured, and the only thing for it is to go out there and do it. Nobody else will, so I'm gonna go myself. I have some adventures, hunting up and down, through the city. Somewhere I'm joined by (or I join) Roger Moore and another girl, blonde, a friend of mine. We've captured a woman who's supposed to be involved in this thing, but it turns out she's been a victim herself. We're going to have to spend the night together, and we get very chummy. In fact we all end up having sex. Now, Roger has so far considered me more like a little sister, but I'm glad he's changed his mind. There's a brief discussion about condoms, and somebody does have some - it crosses my mind to be sure he changes them from one to another of us. As we start to undress, I end up getting closest to him, and rather feel I've taken over, which is okay with me. In other scenes, I run into a girl I know but don't like much - she's short and funny-looking (and I can't remember where I know her from) - she says she's glad to see me, we don't see each other much. The 1st of these times is in a building, the 2nd is outdoors - I'm trying to keep up with some people walking and she comes to stroll beside me. I'd like to get away from her. Eventually, we get back to the courtroom, the blonde girl and I - and we turn the place on its ear. We expose the ringleaders of the gang, which includes Groucho, and discover the crucial evidence at the top of one of the giant windows. It has Venetian blinds - somebody has to climb to the top and get whatever it is. Big show. All the perpetrators get hauled off to jail, protesting and threatening, and things get quiet again. Now it's all over, I look back and see it's been 3 weeks since all this started. "Tree weeks", I say, "that took 3 whole weeks." As if I'm amazed. (433 words)

I'm in a studio with a guy I know pretty well and a couple of other people (one's a woman, all young). He's a photographer or something and this is a kind of hidden place where they can do their own work, to experiment and try stuff out, and play. I'm a guest. Actually I've been here before, my px brought me here some time ago. He thought of it as a kind of crash pad. Now I see there's an organized group here and I'm a little sheepish about it. I don't want to tell them because they think hardly anybody knows about this place, and I don't want to disappoint them. It's morning - I think we've spent the night here. (123 words)

I'm visiting out of town and am with Brad and An important person and somebody else, a woman. We're at a back yard, very large, it's dark and there's not much light - low to the ground, diffused, a bit eerie. B and R have crossed the yard to the back fence where there's a shed and I suppose the trash cans. They're working away at something quite happily. Don't know yet what they're doing but they'll be there a while and I need to go back there to be with them. I'm reluctant, because it's so far and dark - there's quite a few trees, and I've been threatened with kidnapping [I don't know why], and I'm scared to be alone. Just the same I start across, and right away someone starts coming after me - I don't know where he's actually come from but he's dark - can't see what he really looks like - trench coat and hat I think. I can dodge him but I don't think I can outrun him all the way to the back of the yard. I start yelling. Brad and An important person can't hear me - it's too far. I yell louder and louder and I'm afraid they'll never hear me, but finally they do. There's a fence back there, too, and I've got to get all the way to the right corner where the gate is, so it's even farther. But the others come running now and chase the guy - there are other people coming too, kind of like a hue and cry. I get comforted by the woman. (268 words)

I'm at a fair-sort-of, very festive, clean place, lots of trees and light, but at a building like a church, school, something with grounds and passages. More an Artfest crowd, Sunday-dressed, well-behaved. There's a blonde guy and his wife interested in my necklace, slightly aggressive but not wanting to be overt about it - the wife walks off a bit to look at something else, I think so the guy can try to sweet-talk me out of it by himself. He is pretty good-looking in a yuppie sort of way, they're a nice pair. [quote note:] I take it out of its bag and it came apart - it's made ["long?"] like Tom's but bigger.

I'm on a bus with a friend, very late at night or early in the morning, we've arrived at a bus termina and we're stuck at the diner - the only place open - with no transportation. She's called her boyfriend, who's come to "rescue" us, we've really had it, tired, draggy after the long ride - he takes us in hand, his poor little waifs - buys us breakfast. (He looks like Richard Masur.) Buncha food, bacon and eggs and that, piled up on those plates - he passes them magnanimously. I have to move some tables around in this place so I can eat facing away from the other customers. Coupla groups like families with kids and I can't quite fit in the middle. There was hardly anybody here at first, but lots more people are coming in. (140 words)

I'm in England visiting (or not - maybe I'll stay) and have been staying with my brother and somebody, who's just left for a weekend or something and My brother's going home. He doesn't really want to but it's got to do with his health or something, he has to. He's taking me to the train/underground/something stop, I'm going further north to visit a friend and we're running late. He has to be leaving right away himself - he says "Hard to believe, at (8.45?) in the morning I'll be back home". I realize suddenly he can keep my cat for me - that'll be such a good idea. He says well, maybe - you don't mean permanently do you? I say, well no, of course I'll just be here a while. But maybe not. I'd like to be able to stay. Now we've gotten to the place for me to get the train - it's dark and there's nobody around. I was supposed to be there at 8-something - .35 or .45, and it's 9 now straight up. For a minute we hope the train's late but surely it's been and gone and what will I do now? He can't stay, I may just have to stay here instead for the weekend. Won't kill me. Earlier (or I got north anyhow) - I'm with the girl I'm visiting - she's a teenager, just going off to school soon. She talks about where she's going to go and I suggest she check out Cambridge and Oxford and those places - she seems to have the idea that those places are only for well-off men and not just anybody. I say they're not and she might as well go somewhere really good if she can. We also talk about her having a car and seeing it repaired - I have a suggestion, something I learned from my px, about the exhaust system? She's a bit excited about having a car of her own, and being able to go around where she wants to. (342 words)

I'm walking in a mall and there's a store that sells silver and I think I'll duck in and look at silver flatware but at first I don't see any and it all seems to be big stuff so I go out and around again. The store is sort of self-contained and has 2 or 3 entrances, so I can go around it and look in the windows and all. I get to the other side and see the room with the flatware is over here. Besides, there's a man following me (or he sure looks like it) and I want to get someplace else, somewhere with people. I go in, see some stuff and see that this outer room is only samples and the main collection's in the next room - they probably have everything. It's a big room with lots and lots of styles and their prices are good. (151 words)

A guy I'm with behaving as if I'm "pursuing" him, when I just like having his company. We're riding in a car first, I think, then walking down a hall/mall, and he says he's going a different way but he doesn't get very far before we're both interested in some person or thing on the way. He's a nice guy but reluctant to invest himself. (65 words)

There's some sort of fair going on and I'm returning from somewhere, coming up on it from behind - it's late, dark, I think they're trying to close down. Still a lot of people here, though, looking at examples of international crafts. I can't get through going up into the tents, so I go around back till I have to go through one with lots of racks of Japanese clothes in. There are long coats, where a sign says "Happi Coats" - I don't think that's right for them - and some shorter ones. I go through and up some stairs - there's 2 levels in here - and out. 
       (Same place, yes?) Sue is interviewing someone on cable TV, and members of the LT community are doing the support jobs, doing the camera, etc. - I'm asked to take over when someone else needs to leave, he or she's just put the camera down and I'm not sure what to do with it. It's actually very like a shotgun mike, it has a conical end on it and you just sort of hold it out there, but I'm having lots of trouble keeping it steady and I can't tell what I'm actually "hitting" with it. I'm picturing this whole interview being shown from side to side and pictures of their feet. Finally when I think it's stable they get up to end the interview and move. And I don't know how to shut it off, either. (248 words)

I'm working in Circulation and just about to leave - this place is sort of a cross between a fair and a theater and a library, and there's a lot of people bustling out there. The desk is busy. One of my co-workers comes in the back office where I am, with (Alma?) and says we've got a money problem - something hasn't come out right about yesterday's fine money - we investigate and pretty soon find the problem. Yesterday was actually okay, but somebody's counted the first 5 for today without changing dates, making yesterday's look wrong. We're all relieved, and I can go home now. (107 words)

There's a "Dating Game" TV show - the 3 contestants are nice young girls, all quite different. One's black, I'm not sure if the other 2 are both white, but they all work at pretty ordinary jobs and have pretty ordinary lives. This game has a new twist: of the 3 guys they each get to pick from, there's one "ringer" - a blonde, gorgeous hunk that none of them would probably connect with in real life (he looks rather like George Michael, but less nasty) - and he gets to be in each group. If any of the girls picks him they get an extra prize. (107 words)

I'm with Jonathan Richman (who looks more like Bob Geldof), arriving at his house for a visit. I don't know him very well but we're striking up a friendship, and since I'm in England he's brought me to see/meet his wife (have I already met her?). He pulled up to the back door and we've gotten out and I'm looking at the back yard, which is huge. It's not so big a place that you can't see anything else; the lawn goes on for a long time but there are other houses and streets and buildings to be seen. And the house itself is situated on a street, rather a nice one. The house is old, fairly large, and 2 or 3 stories, with a large set of steps up to the back door. Not a big porch, though. We go up and he unlocks the door, and we go into the kitchen, then through to the front living room. We pass the stairs. Jonathan is talking about 2 or 3 things, and I start to ask if his wife is upstairs, but then I notice the furniture and open my mouth to mention that. This house is not fancy, by a long shot - it's in good repair, I expect, but not fixed up at all; the furniture is as old as the house practically, and threadbare. He's got what he needs, I guess, and I know he's happy here, satisfied, but it is a little sad-looking. Still it's not grubby or smelly or unpleasant. I start to say something, then stop - he says "What?" and I say pretty much the above, like for a minute I was thinking this wasn't very fancy for a rock star, then I'd thought, well, he hasn't been that famous for very long, after all, and just buying the house itself was a pretty big deal. I guess if he wants to fix up the furniture, he'll do it sometime. Meanwhile I'm being made quite comfortable here myself, and I appreciate it. I'm sitting on the couch when some other visitors come - a couple who are friends and a guy who's one of Jonathan's longtime buddies - since they were kids - they come in and sit and chat. The buddy is an inveterate storyteller and he makes very cheery conversation, and they ask me how long I'm staying and how I like it, all that stuff. (I'm sort of in the middle of my trip - I hope I have this much fun for the rest of it.) I'm looking out the window at the street scene, and there are various people out there including this older man who was here earlier - he's a bit dotty, tallish, wears a baggy raincoat, matching hat, sort of wild hair. He's just the sort of dotty that he comes up and makes strange conversation but doesn't get loud or difficult. He's out there talking to some kids. It's a lovely quiet and slow summer afternoon, nobody has anything pressing to do, people are out strolling and talking. I have to leave now, and I wish I could stay and talk longer, especially to the old-buddy fellow, he's a lot of fun and seems to like me. But I make my good-byes, and go out the front door, and drive down the street looking around at the houses and trees and things on the way. (572 words)

I'm supposed to be at an exercise class but I'm late and I also have a doctor's appointment - I think I can still get in on the class, though - it's 9.30 now and the doctor probably won't be ready right on time. But it's cutting it awfully fine. I've been into the gym changing room and back out to my car already, now I'm changing my mind and I'm going to pull on my leotard here in the car. It'll be awkward but I think I can do it. But no, really I think I'll be in a mess if I do that, I'd better not. I go to the doctor's office and Sandie is standing on the porch. She's a bit serious about something. [We interact, but I don't remember it now.] (127 words)

I'm with Tom Selleck; we've been somewhere together on some sort of adventure, and come back to town successful and triumphant - even so, it's just us and our other companion (a dark-haired girl, like Barbara Parkins - she's somebody we rescued or picked up along the way.) - whatever we did, nobody knows about it yet, we're just getting back onto the streets and getting ready to go back to normal, I guess. "Barbara" goes off a bit and I can speak to Tom alone. He's wearing a black feather mask like the ones we saw at the Faire. We hug, relieved and tired and satisfied, and I say "I love you", inadvertently. He lets go and draws away just a little, looking askance. I put my hands on his face and say, look it's okay, I don't mean anything bad - just listen to me: show me the truth on your face, let me see the real you, and I'll tell you the truth: I do love you and I'm glad we were together. (I am feeling affectionate and also sure and grounded.) I'm entering the school auditorium, there's an aisle dividing the main floor from the balcony (kind of like the Movie theater, but nicer), and I see the beige/tan fabric on the walls and seats, it matches the carpet even. I usually sit in the balcony, but this time I think I'll try turning right instead and I go down the main floor - which steps down - and I see Cynthia and Linda sitting behind her, one side. So they wave and say hello and I go sit next to Cynthia. They're glad to see me. (281 words)

I'm at a drive-in movie theater, big place, huge screen. We're all out of the car, visiting or doing something else - the movie isn't running anyway. It's been raining. There's a movie actor here, over at the office or whatever that is in the middle, down near the screen, he's doing a personal appearance. He seems to be a real nice guy, I'd like to get to know him. I'm wondering if I can. There's a dog here, too (I don't know if he's mine or not, black, biggish, nice dog, and he's got to come home with us, after having been somewhere for something. And he's gotten rained on. I'm worried it'll rain again and he'll get even wetter and then we'll have to drive back with him all a mess in the car. I get in the car for a minute, then coming back out I encounter a stinging insect which I'm not too pleased about. I wonder if I just got stung myself (I don't feel any pain on my skin), and if he'll be back to plague us on the way home. Actually the car's not in a good position, too close to another one, and I want to move it. So I push it. Somebody thinks I can't do it by myself, in the mud and all with other cars to run into, but it's really very easy. Just push, it goes, I turn the wheel, pull the handbrake to stop it. I got it maneuvered back into position very easily. (257 words)

I'm getting to know a family who live next door in a house - I live in an apartment or condo with Dad and my Stepmother. There are several kids, teenagers and a little older, all pretty nice and we're palling around. We go somewhere, it's afternoon and we're just walking around, and we pass by something that I climb on like a little pile of rocks or something. We're talking away and having a good time. We get back to their house and there's kittens - not only the fuzzy, frisky size, but newborns too, lots of kittens - we visit them for a while. We go and sit, me and the girl, while one brother goes off to play baseball or something - these are active kids, they move around a lot. We talk about dinner but never get up to do anything about it. I talk to the oldest boy quite a lot, we seem to have a lot in common and he likes me, rather. I go on back to my apartment and see my family for a minute, then go on to my room. This room is big and white - everything is very arty, with clean spare lines, sliding doors, everything Design. Before I even get settled in, the boy from next door calls me on the phone - it's a wall phone with a lot of buttons - and he says he's just thought, why don't we go out somewhere? And I say, "When?" and he says "Right now" - I say, well, uh, um, I guess so - he seems pleased as hell, like he'd been working up to this and now it's actually true. And I'm thinking, well, now I've got a date with this kid - what am I gonna do? This is ridiculous - I don't even have anything to wear - he's gonna be dressed up [I don't know how I know that] and I don't have anything nice, I don't think. I figure I've got maybe 5 minutes before he gets here - I want to call my parents but I can't think what their extension is - I punch 2 numbers at random, thinking I might get lucky, but I get Winfred in the print shop, and I say "wrong number" and hang up - I guess I'll give that up and go look at clothes. As I get to the other side of the room where the "closet" is, next to the door, a passel of people come in. They're older, middleaged mostly, and they've come sort of as a tour group, but I know some of them. They want to see me, and hover around and get in my way and won't let me try things on. A couple of them ask how I feel and say I don't look well, suspiciously, as though they suspect I'm not taking care of myself. I tell them I'm ok, but I'm a little worried about what they mean - though not as worried as I am about getting dressed for this date. He's gonna be here any minute and I haven't so much as combed my hair, or anything. 
       Another scene, possibly in the previous dream but I'm not sure: I'm on the toilet, and finish a roll of toilet paper - the next one I take out seems a little different but I don't know how. Two people come in wanting toilet paper since they're also out, but they don't want this because it's smaller, too narrow. I look at it and see that it is, about 3/4 the size of a normal roll. Doesn't bother me any (though I do consider that the manufacturer has increased his profit at our expense), and I wonder what the others (one of them is Heidi) intend to do without any. (637 words)

I'm with my brother at a place like a hotel with a race track, and he wants to practice driving. It's rainy and getting dark. We walk over to the place where the cars are and we meet a couple of old friends from years ago. They're all going to get together later. My brother drives off, one of the other guys goes ahead, and the other guy and I decide to mosey back to the hotel. [I'm unsure if I wanted to go somewhere else or get my stuff out of my car and go in.] Just before we get there I realize he's got my car key. I'm very concerned about this and I wonder if I should go flag him down in the car or not. First I go back across the parking lot to look on the ground for it. No dice, and it's gonna start raining. Just about the time I start off to flag him down, I find the key in my purse. I'm relieved. Also: I'm with a girlfriend (we're both quite young, aren't we?), having left my house walking through the neighborhood, and we pass by this guy's house. He lives here, we think alone, and he's pretty good-looking. (Dark hair, 30's, well-built.) His door is open, and we're not sure if he's home, but we take it into our heads to look after his plants. We come on in, looking round a bit, and get to watering and futzing with the plants - he's got a lot, hanging and on stands and things, in pots. Nice place, eclectic, lots of high ceiling and air in, interesting shadows. He's here, actually, but doesn't mind what we're doing - he's something like a writer and not very social, but not unfriendly either. Doesn't pay us a lot of mind. But his plants do need attention. While we're here, a woman comes in, around his age, nice looking - surprised to see us here. I don't know her, but I think she may be his girlfriend, and I hope she doesn't think we shouldn't be here. She may think this is her job. I'm uncomfortable and I expect we should go. (347 words)

I'm with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who I keep calling Conan - he's driving me back from somewhere and I talk him into going to pick up Melanie, who's at a house somewhere in a neat neighborhood, and she's like spent the night with this unsavoury guy who may do her some harm, I think. So we get there - actually I think he knows the guy, or something, and goes in. Melanie comes out, I'm not sure she comes out the door, does she sort of "escape" out a window or something? Anyway, she gets to the truck and I'm rather nervous about being here and want to get away quick and Conan isn't coming out. I don't feel right about leaving him but I drive us off, and it's getting dark and (raining?). Actually now that we're on the road there's a 3rd person with us, another woman - we're on a big road, close to where we're going, with 3 lanes or so each way, and lotsa traffic, and the road being torn up. I'm not having that easy a time handling this truck, and what with the slick road it skids and turns over on its side. We're not hurt, but we gotta get out and away from the traffic - we scramble to the front and I can see all these other cars coming and I'm terrified they're going to crash into us and pile up several, right on top of us. We're scrambling over the piled-up road and clamber over into the big ditch by the side of the road. Geez what a relief. But now we gotta be rescued from the ditch. We watch for a while and people come with emergency cars and stuff. Then we go over to the left side (backward, that is) where there's a bit of ledge we can climb up on and stand close to the top. Some people come there to help - turn out to be somebody I know (LT? SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM?), so we stand and talk while we're waiting for someone to pull us out. (352 words)

I'm going to see a preview of a play or maybe poetry reading or something, very small potatoes, in a small theater that's part of some other institution. I've been invited to come for free by Jon, who's instrumental in getting this thing put on, he may have even written some of it. I've come up the hall to where the door is, and I say hi to Jon, who's also just come up and is waiting for his wife, to bring some things. She comes up with this huge load of stuff, even a bouquet of roses sticking up over her face. I make some joke about her having to carry all this stuff, but nobody notices. The roses are to go right here at the entrance. Another person I know, Rory, comes up (I haven't seen her in a long time and she sure looks different) and we all exchange greetings. Jon offers us each a rose (he's all dressed up in a tux, by the way) and as I take it I realize it isn't real, it's wax or something. They do smell, and I put it to my nose and then for a laugh I take a bite of it. I'm not really sure quite what it's made of, after all. It tastes almost as if it were meant to be eaten. I believe I'll take another bite, but I'll wait till Paula can't see me so she won't think I don't care about my pretty rose. So Rory and I go on inside. There doesn't seem to be anyone taking tickets even if we had any, but we wanted to make sure. This is certainly is a tiny place, probably 20 people across by maybe 15 down, tops. Behind the rows is a little gift shop, I guess for the whole building, not just the theater. Rory looks at some stuff there and I look at something just outside its entrance. Someone does come to take tickets, I guess he just stepped out. I wonder if we'll have to explain we've been invited for free. (350 words)

Mom and I are at a fair or something and leaving. It's an old-time sort of thing, very ethnic, and we come past a pastry booth where they're selling things like kolaches, but they're not flat, they're like little pastry tulips, most of them, and have a lot of different fillings, savoury or sweet, and have a different name [which I've forgotten]. All these women are behind the counters, dressed in their old-country costumes and talking loudly in their old-country accents. I didn't think Mom would want to stop at all, but she does, and I didn't think she'd want the sweet ones, but she does, and we make our way to the right-hand counter. The booth is all wood, with a rooflet and darkish. The place is open, and make L-shape with an extra corner: The meat and vegetable fillings on the left and the fruit fillings on the right. We go over to the right and have a look, then turn to the center where the actual counter is [in the diagram above, the upper right corner], and talk to the blonde woman there. She has a sharp voice, all business. I look at the fruit fillings; I can see blueberries, all plump and round. Back left I can see the nice little tulip-shapes and some kind of meat fillings.

I'm in another theater, a big one, not many people here, and I'm with a group. We're sitting down close to the front, center, and somebody asks us to move. I don't know why, but we do move to the back, where there's some other things, like an opening into a large hallway with pinball and video machines. There's a ledge where some of the older ones of us sit down, and I'm not real happy standing, so I take a spot there too. The show hasn't started, won't for a while yet - this isn't entertainment we've come for, but something maybe political or social, something dramatic - I think we're planning to "do" something ourselves and that's why there's this tension, a real sober undercurrent among us; I don't know about the other people here. Nobody's talking about it. (141 words)

I'm in a garage with a girlfriend; we've just been out somewhere and are going back through town, stopping here to get the car worked on or something, and we're still in very jolly spirits (it was a fun outing) and poking around in this garage. She's looking out the window at the street and turns back to tell me she's just seen this good-looking guy that I was drooling over at wherever-we've-been, go into a store across the street! She teases me about it, saying I should go talk to him, and I'm thinking about it. In the meantime [something we do causes a big oil spill on the floor of the garage, and the men who work here come back from outside and are not happy about it.] Still, we're very lighthearted and girlish, giggling over the boy.

I've been at a large glamorous motel, it's night, the place is all lit up and glittery, festive. [Something dramatic happens, and I end up leaving the scene in a hurry in a van with somebody else, being driven by a young boy.] We seem to be driving away from the motel, but it's much bigger than I thought, and the buildings keep on looking alike as we drive through. We've already turned right twice. The buildings are less glamorous now, but you'd suppose they would be. We make another right turn, and come into another neighborhood, and drive along a fence which is down an alley; or at least the fence is between two blocks of houses back-to-back; it doesn't seem like an alley, really. We come to where the fence stops, and get out. For some reason we're reluctant to go to the other side of the fence, because we're not sure what's there. So we walk around rather than take the van. On the other side it's daylight. It looks just like the side we were on, houses and all just the way it should be, but it's daylight instead of night. (Actually it's not pitch dark anyway - you might think of it as more dawn, you can see a bit - but not dusk, it's definitely been night.) We look back again to see, and by George it's still night over there, and day here. There's something suspicious about this and uncomfortable, like this daylight is not the way it's supposed to be, and we're going to get into big trouble if we stay here. (245 words)

At Faire for some other reason, ran into Dara - I forgot she'd be here for a workshop of some kind, don't know what, attending with a friend I don't know. They collar me to talk, they're on a lunch break. I explain what I'm looking for, they can't help. I need to leave soon. Before I can go, I get stopped by another person I know, [can't place her for sure - some Sandra, some Suzann] a blonde girl, who cuddles up against me as we sit with some other people watching a sort of training/educational film on a screen. Actually it's kind of interesting, and it's comfortable here, I can't stay long, though. I get to thinking about the trip and how tiring it will be - I hope I don't have to spend my whole vacation recovering from the trip up and then spoil it with the trip down. I'm thinking, maybe I could go up in stages - stay overnight between legs, or something. How would that be? I'll investigate it. This girl and I are quite comfortable, she keeps leaning into me and we also hold hands. I really like this, I appreciate the affection. But I'm not entirely comfortable, and I do have to go now the film's over. (205 words)

I'm at the Faire site, either midweek or after closing (though the sun's out) - everybody's gone and all the booths are empty. [It looks different, of course.] There are some SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM people around, doing their thing, still in costume. One of them has videotaped something during the day, I think a minor event of theirs, when there were plenty of people about - all of them were in costume, I notice - just like a real fair. I look around on the screen for myself, but I'm not in it. It's interesting to look at the same scene you're looking at right now, only with people, then without, then with, then without. They'd as soon I stayed and played with them, but I have to be on my way. I brought Tree with me and I have to fetch him. [I can't remember if he was in a carrier and got out, or had been out all along.] I keep calling "Tree!" and I'm getting worried. But now I do hear him, somewhere. I call some more and I think I hear him from under this vehicle here that's under an open shelter. Then I hear catfight noises, and I break it up only to find it's not Tree after all, but a big fluffy dark-gray-striped cat who's with a friend, worrying a koala bear, a small one. Well! The gray cat's pretty mad, but he knows not to mess with me, and takes off shortly. This still leaves me not knowing what to do with this koala bear, and I've got to find Tree. (247 words)

I'm on a city street, walking, there are lots of people around, I know at least some of them, that is to say I live here and am a part of this place, I belong here. It's daytime but the sun's not terribly bright - a workday. From somewhere comes a fire alarm, sounds like the one at work, and everybody starts moving to certain places, as though it's backwards and you respond to this signal by going underground rather than outside. There's no fear, everybody seems to know or assume it's a fire drill [and that's what it's called, too - there's no assumption that it's anything else, like bombs]. The place I'm going to is at a corner, and looks like a drain opening. I'm not sure exactly what to do, but Kay is right in front of me and she says we go down here. I'm thinking surely a person can't get into that, but as I get closer I see it's bigger than I thought. Still it looks awfully cramped, and I'm not looking forward to squeezing into it and maybe hurting myself, but Kay just steps into it and goes down like she's walking on a staircase. By George, that's what it is, and it's even big enough for more than one person. [I'm not conscious of the opening actually getting bigger, but surely it must be - it looked so very different from time to time as I approached.] Now we're part of a group steadily moving down the stairs to what looks like an Underground station. Kay goes off somewhere else, but I'm staying here in the near vicinity, and there are 3 or 4 guys sitting together in a sort of small auditorium, near the back. There's nothing actually going on in here, just people sitting through the fire drill, and I chat a bit with these guys. They're maybe in their twenties, buddies - I'm not entirely comfortable with them, they don't altogether want me in their group, but I don't want to go off anywhere by myself. We talk about getting something to eat - there's a sort of kitchen nearby, and the idea is something like (pizza?), maybe we could get that together. But I'm not sure, maybe I should get some fruit instead. I get up and I'm actually thinking about going up outside. [The idea is like there's a fruit-cart out there, or something - it's a bit mixed up with my basket of fruit on the counter. And this in spite of the fact that there hasn't been an all-clear signal yet, we're not supposed to go out - and I have the idea you stay down for quite a while when you do this.] (354 words)

I'm with or associated with some branch of the government and I know the office where Adderly works (but I don't actually work there myself) and I have something to tell him about a girl who's the center of the case he's working, but I can't get to him to tell him. I've been at the scene where something had happened and there were a lot of men doing the police-y things they do at crime scenes, but I couldn't get inside, so now I'm here at the office but he's not. He does come in briefly but has to leave again right away and I'm pretty much at a loss and so are the other girls here. What we have is a kind of counter-office enclosure like you see in old buildings (I'm thinking of the car-license area in the Records Building, where there's public traffic and individual desks both) and 3 or 4 office-girls work in here, but they're not "operational", as it were. I give up and go outside the enclosure to go away and I talk to a girl I know who's at the front of the counter and sticking up through it. There's some reason for this normally but she's in here this time trying to fix something. There's a door inside that slides up and down to open the compartment where you sit with your head and shoulders (and arms?) out of the counter, to deal with the public. She's having trouble with the door and shows me. I commiserate and leave. After I leave I go for a drive (?) out in the country. As I continue on the road that led out of town it gets narrower and the fields grow right up to it and finally tall plants - corn, maybe, or wheat - are overhead and you can't see from side to side. I stop at the entrance to a sort of crafts fair or show or something, off to the left in a building or set of buildings behind the plants. [They remind me of another crafts fair I dreamed about, that was in something like a monastery. Very open place.] I go into a room where there are exhibits of Victorian lace and dolls and pretty bedroom furniture. At the same time a little girl and her mother come into the room, and the little girl is very pretty, dressed like a doll herself, and has a tail on a string that she's dragging around with her, as if it were a pull-toy. [Does she have a cat with her, as well? Dunno.] I look at this tail as well as I can without staring, and I think it's a cat's tail, but I think to myself, "surely it can't be - perhaps a rabbit's instead". [Notwithstanding rabbits' tails aren't long and striped.] Her mama says something to her, and the drift of the comment includes a remark about her kitties - such as a reference to "when we got blank and blank" (whatever their names were), and presumably one of them is still here [aha - does this mean she does have a cat with her?]. I ask casually what about the other cat and Mama says "Oh, he died" - of something or other - however she put it, it was made plain that the cat died naturally and this tail is a sort of memento for the kid. I'm relieved. (527 words)

I'm at work [which isn't the library, at least as I know it] and I'm making records on some kind of imprinting machine - it makes plastic labels like a label gun does. I ask my supervisor what to call it, and (he/she?) says something incoherent and goes off. This has been happening lately, and it's getting worse. (He/she?) is a trifle hostile with it, and I'm wondering - along with the other people here - how it's going to end. (He/she?) is going off (his/her?) rocker, and yet is still the boss here. Mostly we're ignoring it and getting the job done anyway, but it can't go on forever. I'm on a roof or ledge, with a rail around it, not a very big place, just concrete, next to probably an apartment house. There are several other girls here with me, people I work with I think, and we're just talking. Across the street is a foreign-car garage - it doesn't look like one, of course, it's a small but architecturally interesting (stucco?) building with 2 sections, looking rather like cylinders. We know what it is because we know MT runs it - it's new, he just got set up and this is a pretty mature and positive thing to do. Also pretty classy, because he's working on fancy cars for fancy people. There isn't much room on this ledge and the rail isn't very high, but I lean out over it for a better look at this garage while we're talking. MT himself comes and joins us. He doesn't look like he used to. He's shaved his beard and his hair is a different style and he looks pensive and a little sad. [Actually, of course, it's not even MT's face, beard or no beard - it's still a small regular face with dark hair and eyes - also no glasses! - but it's a handsomer face with softer features.] I'm sitting on a concrete ledge on the street next to a vendor of pastries - this is a downtown area, very bustling, cosmopolitan - open-air bistros and vendors, pedestrians. MT is sitting on my right and a couple I know rather better are sitting on my left. We're all three chatting away, but MT is sort of detached and pensive. It starts to rain, pretty hard too, and I have an umbrella which after a moment's fumbling I get up and put over both of us. Me and MT, that is, and he seems a little surprised. The other couple get up and leave (I think to get out of the rain), but we stay and the rain slacks off. I talk to the pastry man a bit and he shows me his wares. It's a bit awkward with MT, we're both being kind of shy. I thought it was odd that the umbrella turned out to be big enough for both of us easily, but we don't have to squeeze up against each other. I find him only mildly attractive because of his looks and his shyness, but I'm sure the reticence goes much deeper and I don't like that. I'm sure I don't want to get involved with him. (487 words)

I'm at a small fair, an old-fashioned theme fair, taking place on a parking lot and in a small building or so, some booths set up inside. I've arrived in a little vehicle that's more like a table, painted red, that you operate single-handed, it sort of flies and sort of rolls. I came by myself, and I've run into Trisha and Lori - they knew I'd be here and we planned to meet. We've gone into this little building and Trisha and I are talking at the counter of this food booth while I look over what they've got and decide what to order. I know the middle-aged blonde lady behind the counter has seen me but she hasn't asked what I want. A man comes up to the counter and orders something (they have some interesting, old-fashioned food here) and I'm sort of vaguely conscious of hearing the woman say "That's the last one" but didn't know what she was talking about. Finally I turn back to see if I can order something, and see that all the food's been taken away and the place shut down. The woman and her assistant are still there around the corner and I go ask her how come she didn't wait on me. She's very brusque and uncaring and says I didn't seem to want anything, so she didn't ask. I feel very hurt and slighted - first she waits on that man before, giving him the last of something before I even get a turn, now she shuts the place down and I can't even get anything to eat. I'm hungry - this isn't fair. I'm also embarrassed that I got into this fix. I go out with Trisha and Lori, but I veer off when they're not looking and go to my "car" and go away. (To drive this thing you start it very much like a car, with both feet, then "drive" it with your hands and your feet trail out behind if you want, or you can keep them up - doing a kind of front bend. Mainly all you do is steer. I don't think you can go up very high, but the wheels on the legs don't always touch the ground.) I drive away and back "home" (I think) down a road with an open hill and wide view of town (much like Hampton hill), then to a neighborhood. [I think I live here - it's sort of like a cross between streets and an apartment hallway. Families live here, and know each other - somebody's always leaning out the front door and talking to someone, or having people over.] (404 words)

I'm at a little gallery or building being used for one, it used to be a house, I imagine. We're setting up an art show in the front room - there are maybe half a dozen artists or less, one of whom is MT, I'm assisting him. This is not just people with oil paintings, it's a variety of things, and what M is showing are little airplanes. They're not replicas, or toys exactly, but they're stylized and cute. The group of people have exhibited together before, and it's a cooperative effort. They've been doing this once a year - though this may only be the 2nd year, I don't know. Anyway, there are people bustling about, putting things up, looking after details. There's somebody in charge, he comes around to check how things are going every now and then, nice polite friendly guy in a suit. One of the things I'm doing is looking out for anything odd. Last year there was a disturbance, a robbery or something, and this time MT has assigned me to poke around and see if there's anything out of the ordinary to suggest something similar might happen. I haven't seen anything, but I have been around to the back of the house and gone into a couple of other rooms. We're behaving kind of like secret agents or something, but we really don't want anything to happen.MT has one of his airplanes suspended on a thread from the ceiling, and I decide it will look better near the entrance where some other things are, to give people coming in a hint of what they'll see. It comes down easily enough, but I'll need help getting it stuck back up, so I go fetch a chair. There's a bar in this room, a padded one like you see in - well, bars, with lots of glasses and it curves around. I get a chair from there. A friend offers to help and I do need it - he's not quite Don Mahon, but that's who I think of. So we tack the thread up where I want the airplane to hang. (357 words)

I'm moving into a new place - a small frame house, oldish, not fancy or in the best of repair, but it's got character and it's on a nice quiet street with trees and bushes and flowers. There's a couple of huge bushes out front next to the walk, and the place is almost enclosed by foliage on the sides. It has a sort-of porch on the front, or a closed-off part of the yard, no floor to it. Tree is here, and maybe MB and Rio, too, but I'm not sure about them - certainly some other cats are here. There are boxes about, some furniture, definitely looks like somebody just moving in and making do. I go out on the "porch" for some reason, and Tree goes with me. I'm not altogether sure this is a good idea because he might be able to get outside - this isn't all that secure. By George, he has gotten out, under the "fence" over on the - suddenly I have a memory of this being fenced in, not a porch - how can it be two things at once? But I have a clear picture of both in my mind as I write. I'm very concerned about Tree being outside - all kinds of things could happen to him. I'd better go get him - but I'm not wearing any clothes. I try calling to him, but he won't come in. So I'm going inside to put something on, some shorts. I go out to see if I can persuade him to come back in. It's dark, just before dawn, and I don't expect anybody will see me. Tree is under those big bushes, facing another cat, a big tough neighborhood tom who's itching for a fight. They're doing all the pre-fight staring and growling and I'm still just calling to Tree to come in. Just as I go toward him, a car comes down the street - the headlights are on, of course, and they can probably see me. I can see it's a couple of nice-looking young guys in the car, and I sure don't want them to see my boobs hanging out like this, so I turn away with my arms in front of my chest and go back somewhat out of the light. I decide I'd better go back in and put on a T-shirt. I'm inside, telling the other cats what's going on and how I'm worried about Tree, somewhat frantically looking for a T-shirt, when suddenly it's light outside. And as I'm noticing that and just getting a shirt on, here's Tree back in - I'm wondering how he got back in so fast, and didn't make a sound. (455 words)

I'm with Lauren and Trisha, downtown, near the library - Trisha is getting a job downtown somewhere and we're talking about how we can go to lunch together. For practice we decide we'll go now, and Trisha suggests this one place that's in the Center. I propose that it's too far away, but she says there's good fast roads and the tollway you can get there by. So we go in her car and swing way out left of downtown (what would be west, since I'm looking north) and we go on some roads I don't recognize. The areas look like some other town, some much older town. There are some nice buildings here, and some nice-looking apartment buildings with vacancy signs - I'd like very much to investigate this. It would be a nice place to live. Somehow we end up not at a restaurant but at their (?) house. [It's a newer house than the one they live in, but still probably Fifties.] It's very reminiscent of houses we lived in (my family) when I was a kid, and there's not much furniture or stuff on the walls, as if they just moved in. (The light reminds me of the house in The suburbs.) [There was more after this: I think a cat was involved and something hanging on a doorknob, but it's gone now.] (192 words)

I'm at a workshop with John Boats but (most?) of these people I don't know - it's pretty big, being held partly in a big arena, partly in a small room or gym with risers. In the arena something takes place where I have to go to the stage. In the other place we've brought our overnight gear and I keep getting up and rearranging my bags, which seem to keep multiplying. They're mostly tote bags like my dingy canvas one, but my suitcase is here, too, and all this stuff got dumped when we came in the room and I don't want people to trip over it. I hope I'm being quiet enough but I know I'm becoming a nuisance getting up over and over - it's obsessive. John is writing things on a board, but it's turned at an angle that makes it hard for me to read. It's as though he's talking about business, or a business he's using as an example of something. I'm not following, of course. The people I'm sitting near are a young married couple with a child or two. The things they talk about are so different, they seem older than me, but I don't think they are, much. The workshop ends (or there's a break), and some of us go out to the lobby where there's a big display of or about some company, fictitious, meant to demonstrate something, and built by this young man that's here. There are several people visiting from outside too. As we look we discuss what we were learning and it seems this display company is sort of plagiarized from or a rehashing of the one John was talking about. The young man looks slightly sheepish but amused. (292 words)

I'm supposed to marry a guy who's a lot like My ex - I said I would because I thought it was too late for me to find another man who'd be willing to marry me and I'm worried I'll be sorry if I don't, later. I'm thinking about this and how I don't want to go through with it but I guess I can stand it. Then I think of having sex with him and can't stand the idea. I decide to break it off with him. He's a wimpy little guy with glasses and I think of him in a dark suit. (104 words)

I've got to get to work and am late for the bus so I've decided to run to work. I've dressed for it in shorts and no shoes and I'm running along Cedar where the Field bus goes but of course it's all different. I run up on a broken-off concrete strip for a bit, then get down, knowing it's dangerous - next to an apartment building, the ground rises from the sidewalk*. Every now and then I turn and look for a bus. I'm conscious of being late for work this way - if I do get a bus I may as well not bother running, but one doesn't come. I notice I'm running on my toes and try to concentrate on using my heels. I turn toward downtown as the bus does and start through a black neighborhood with a sort of honkytonk bit. I pass a brick shops-block and look inside a window of a place that's a bar, apparently, and it fits, there's stuff like beer ads on the wall but the room is empty. [It's still darkish outside.] Shortly I pick my way over a lot of broken beer-bottle glass in the parking lot, and turn right again; now I've got to get through a sleazier part before I get to where downtown starts being business. I run into an old man who wants me to stop and I sort of dance backwards to hear him. Then he brings out a knife and says he wants my money - I tell him I don't have any and he's not very good at this, he just looks a bit sad and dithers. I say I'm sorry and turn to run on and immediately run into a young man, blondish hair, jacket, jeans, who stops me the same way but gets up close to me. I grab his hands and try to hold them out, but he's stronger than me, he's already got a knife and he works it to point at the back of my thigh and I realize I can't stop him and he's mean. He asks left or right? I don't know what he means and he jabs it at (into?) my leg and says "shall I turn it to the left or right?" Apparently the damage done would be different. I'm scared and petrified. (387 words)

I'm at sea on a military ship - I'm the captain and I'm nearly in charge but there's this other officer (played by William Hurt) who's capable of interfering with my plans, and a woman officer who's not actually a shipboard officer but something like an investigator or a shrink and she seems to have it in for me. Something's been going wrong on the ship and it's like a mystery-story. Wm. Hurt seems to be well-liked and the crew (there are women among them) like to do what he says. They don't precisely ignore me but I could ask for better cooperation. Actually I like him too but this is awkward. 
       Wm. is trying to repair something in a sort of hole in a wall of electronic equipment; he's had to like jam his whole body inside this small opening to check things out, and there are some crewmen helping him. There's a large Styrofoam cup with something nasty in it (that somehow I acquire) and when I ask about what to do with it I get a snotty reply [from whom?], so I throw it on the floor. Actually somebody jostled me and some spilled first, which startled me and I dropped it. Now I'm really frustrated. I look around for someone to clean it up. There are some crew sitting at some small tables right here around the corner as though we've just been having a tea or something, and some of them get up and leave. I call out, "Is anybody here free to come clean up this floor?" or words to that effect and reluctantly a couple come forward. The stuff in the cup was both oily and caustic, so this requires some special attention. I'm actually embarrassed to have someone else clean it up since it was my fault, and I am fighting the urge to do it myself, but I'm the captain here and I know I shouldn't do that sort of thing. So I set them to doing the job and go back to Wm. Hurt and the "investigator". She's there next to the wall where he is with a plate of french fries and something else - I think she made them herself - that she's feeding him. I comment on this and she snidely remarks that he hasn't had anything to eat in ____ long and he needs to keep his strength up. I sample one of the fries when I think she's not looking, very big and fresh they are. This work he's doing on the ship seems to be sabotage, but I don't know what the results of it would be except to get us off course. The "investigator" says she wants to tell me something round the corner, and we move off. I'm standing, not facing her, expecting her to move around further, and someone starts talking in a voice that sounds mechanical. It says something about now that we're within sight of land, we'll be getting ready to (what? do a proper investigation?) since it was my fault. I don't think I heard right, and I don't know where it was coming from, so I say "Who's that? Repeat that, please" or something and she starts over, it's coming from her, I don't know why her voice sounds like that, and I don't know what she means about "it" being "my fault". Nor was I aware we were anywhere near land, but I can see we are, just barely on the horizon. Also: I'm with a man at a shop or something, looking for a teapot. This tubby little old woman only has 2, one's squattier than the other, both pottery, and she says (or a sign says?) they come with strainers. When we choose one, the squatty one, she digs around and brings out a plastic thing that's not even round and doesn't look like a strainer to me, and we try to fit it into the pot and of course it won't go. We call it to her attention. I think it was just a minor ruse. (683 words)

[Not much retained of larger dream.] I'm with Tree, sort of, but he's big and white like Lick - is it Lick after all? - I don't think so. We're going around the block, sort of [don't remember why]. What I seem to see is an area laid out kind of like a game board, and I started going to the left, or counter-clockwise. I'm passing through yards or houses, whatever's more convenient, and one house in the middle of this side I go into looks empty, but it's not. I step into this room through an outside door, and as soon as I get inside I know something's different. I stand there for a second and suddenly there's this great big power that takes over. It's kind of like a hurricane force, it keeps me standing still and I can just barely move with a great effort. I know this is some kind of entity, it's very agitated but not actually angry - it didn't want to be disturbed, I think, is the problem, and I've just walked in on it without knocking. All the same, if I'm gonna get out of its way I've got to move, and I realize I could just stay here and be paralyzed and frightened, but I know I can handle it if I just stay calm and try to breathe evenly. That's hard - I can't breathe easily under this pressure but I do the best I can and get it under control enough to break loose, get Tree, and lurch across to the other door, which is standing partly open with the daylight coming through it. (The room is old-looking, bare walls and wood floor, no furniture to speak of, and dark.) As I get through the door, I turn and face back into the room, where this force is still raging at me, and I want it to know I mean it no harm and wish it well, so I try to make the Peace sign with my right hand and say it aloud. Takes some effort but I finally do it. Then I go on. [There's no fear in this, but a sense of being able to handle all this force and come out on top. There's a little touch of exasperation at the overreaction, and the "Peace" sign is what I feel the situation calls for. After that, I leave it to its own devices, I'm complete with it.] I go on to round the block, and pass by a house with a family and a litter of kittens. Tree goes across the street while I look at them. We eventually get back where we were. (385 words)

I'm with George and several other yoga people including Cynthia, hanging around a street corner, getting ready to go on a yoga trip to the Middle East somewhere (not India, but some unspecified place in the Middle East). Cynthia has some name-tag labels, just narrow strips, and she puts her own on. (I can read "Cynthia" on it.) So we get on a plane and make a trip, landing at a very small airport that turns out to be Indianapolis. That's as far as we got on the first leg of this trip. I've been very worried about the expense of this trip, I'm not sure I can afford it - it'll be several hundred dollars altogether and I'm not sure I want to spend all that. I was worried about it before but everybody said, come on, you'll love it, you'll see, and so I came along. I know I can charge a lot of it to MasterCard, but do I really want to? Now that I'm here, I see this tiny little airport, and I'm not at all sure I want to leave at all. It's a little building on a tree-lined country lane, lovely place [somehow I didn't realize Indianapolis wasn't a big city after all], I'm wondering if I can get a job here, at least for a while. [Note: we came south to get here from where we started.] Actually this is a library as well as an airport terminal. That's very handy, it's a very nice little small-town library with standard modern equipment. I seek out a bathroom, find it down a short hall and have to maneuver amongst boxes and stacks of things, and I do have a bowel movement. But (the same way it is with peeing) even as I stand up I have the same urge and have to go again right away, and I discover I haven't taken my underpants down. I'm disconcerted about this, now I've got shit in my pants, I hope I can deal with it before somebody finds out. I feel very exposed and it doesn't even seem as if I'm in the bathroom now, but out in the building. (343 words)

I'm going to a horror movie with Linda and some other people, including my brother and Tim- maybe 8 or 9 of us altogether. We get there after they do, and go into what looks like a standard theater like the Village was. The place is huge and packed. We sit on the end of the row in back of the others, and people are milling about, it doesn't ever exactly quiet down, and the movie starts. It really is a horror film, really gross - lots of people are really disgusted, including Thai and others of my party, and they leave at intermission. It doesn't bother me much, and someone else with us, she's just been closing her eyes, which she thinks is good enough. At intermission we go to the lobby to get popcorn and things - I find peanuts (salted, Spanish) in a basket and sort of try to grab what I can with my hand, wondering why there are loose peanuts at a movie theater, when the guy behind the counter shows me these little bags and a scoop. So I fill myself up a little bag and go back to my seat. Actually things are starting to get raucous now - the movie hasn't restarted and people are standing up talking, some maybe shouting, Linda and I decide to go out for something and come back. [Don't know what for - maybe just a walk.] We go out the regular front doors, then somewhere out in the neighborhood, then come to the end of a street and back to the theater at the other end, but now it's an open-air theater, we're looking up at the rows of seats, facing the people. They really are stirred up now, this is looking more and more like a rally with dangerous people (a lot of black leather jackets) being pumped up by somebody on the stage. As a matter of fact, the whole scene is creepy - that guy on the stage could be Dracula, and we've both got the feeling we maybe shouldn't try to run away since these people can all see us, but we're real reluctant to go back to our seats up through all these people. Somehow, though, we get there, and I take myself into the back of the theater, where there are some corridors (very plain - no doors, nothing on the walls) - I go down them to this open area, not a proper room, exactly, where there's a counter on the left, and a picnic basket. I take some things out of it - I'm fixing a sandwich, I think. [I don't know when this basket was put here - I don't remember bringing it here - and I don't know why it's a secret.] I'm starting on my way back when I get accosted by a little blonde kid with a little bitty knife. He wants to know why I'm not with the others, as if I'm trying to run away, which I'm certainly not, from back here - I don't think you can even get out this way. He's very supercilious and thinks he's real tough with this dinky little knife - probably from watching those other toughs with their big ones - but I certainly know the thing could do plenty of damage anyway, and I grab his hand and hold it away. Then there pops in a little blonde girl about his size, also with a knife and the same bad attitude. I grab her hand too and I'm wondering what to do next when I wake up. I'm holding the image in my mind, experimenting with threatening to poke one of the kids' eye out with his/her knife, and I go back to sleep and find myself captured, I've been taken to a house somewhere where this Dracula and a woman are holding me. [I don't know what for, unless for being subversive to their cause.] One or another of them talks for a while, being very threatening, do-you-know-what-I'll-do-to-you-if-you-don't-talk, that sort of thing. Then somehow I find myself in the back of an RV of some type, with a couple of guys and a little girl or two, their daughter (or daughters?). I know Dracula has sent me here, though it doesn't look like any sort of punishment. But we can't get out of the thing and it's starting to roll toward a cliff. (We're in a forest-campground sort of place, and they were on a camping trip.) It really does look like we're going to go over, though there's a couple of false starts. (725 words)

Linda and I are running this movie theater, and showing this big-time, quite long movie by means of a video player. It's not a real big theater, it's oldish, reminds me of the one in Schulenberg that I didn't see, but how such a place might be - got patterned rugs on the floor, globe lamps, velveteen seats, bit of gingerbread - not glamorous, but old-timey. The audience doesn't fit well with the place - a lot of 'em are tough types, and you want to keep them happy. The movie we're showing is this long saga about this young man's odyssey through the world, he gets into lots of very different situations, wars, romances, human interest stuff, learning all about the world, etc. Can't tell exactly when it's set, maybe covers a few hundred years, maybe only an appropriate length of the 19th century - it's got so many locations you'd think he couldn't do them all in a lifetime. But it's definitely historical - not the recent past. The audience is pretty attentive and seem to like it. I have to do something at the video console, which is off to the audience's left, and there's all this equipment in front of me, and lots of buttons. I'm supposed to be setting up a future part of the movie and I push the wrong button. I don't know what I've done for a bit, although something does seem to be wrong; then I realize I've punched in a much later part of the movie, which is now on the screen. I don't really know how to fix it, and I start examining buttons, which doesn't help much. I hit one that (I think) starts a soundtrack from another part, and it's coming across at the same time as the other scenes. Linda comes over to ask what's gone wrong, some of these guys are losing interest and leaving. She says to turn the sound down on the other track and that's harder to do than you'd think, but I got it there eventually. Then we try to fix the scene back and don't get it; Linda says we'll just have to rewind the thing back to where it was. This is awful. The movie is well along at this point and it'll be a long way back - in fact, the rewind goes slower than I thought, and the picture stays on the screen. We see all sorts of things (to "come", in the proper sequence) - sailing ships, a map of the world, people doing different things and wearing different clothes, all sorts of stuff. It seems it'll be forever till we get back to the gypsy camp where we left him, but I guess we do. I get up and go out later - there aren't a whole lot of people here now - and go outside, a few doors down the street and around the corner. [I don't know what for unless to hide.] After a bit, I think I may come back in, though I'm rather afraid to - I think those tough guys may know it was me who screwed the movie up and come after me. I look back at the theater - it's dark on the street and I see the darkened marquee (old-style, rows of light bulbs) and the dark ticket window, and nobody about. As I come closer, I don't hear any sounds either. (There are no doors on the front.) I walk in very quietly - I don't think there's anybody here at all, but then I hear sounds. Somebody's coming up and out of the theater. Since I don't know who it is, I think I'd better hide. There's a parlor off to the left, with old-fashioned chairs and tables, doilies and antimacassars. No place good to hide, though, so I get down behind a chair at the very back of the room in the shadows, figuring I won't be noticeable if they don't look this way. There's a door next to me (kitchen door?) but I don't have time to go through it quietly. As they come into view, though, I see it's not who I was afraid of, but a man and a woman (or so - I don't know who, but one might be My brother; I don't think they're a couple) and 2 little girls, one of whom was in the film. I get up and greet them, explaining why I was hiding, and saying how pleased I am to see them. I talk to the little girl who acted in the film and tell her what a good job she did. (She has dark hair and is dressed in a pretty little dress. I seem to have her be the same as the little girl who was in the RV going over the cliff.) (804 words)

I'm in a kind of theater watching a sort of improvisational group (all young, eager-to-break-out types) do a variety of, shall we say, experimental pieces. None of them are anything to write home about, and one bit is just plain bad - a girl is doing a dance that might have been meant for ballet, but mostly consists of her moving from place to place and posing. At one point the audience is expected to participate - we get up and sort of march around. (This theater is more like a gym with bleachers in it, only one side, but I do think it's not really.) We go up and then around a bit - this one woman and I (she's older than me, rather housewifely, short middle-class hair, decade-off clothes with a scarf) march all the way around to the front again and by that time they've started doing something else, and we sort of hesitate for a second to walk in front of the other people, but we do anyway - it's not as if we're disturbing anybody. Another time there's a sort of intermission, and some of us go outside. There's a little shop nearby [where I see or find something that I react to - either something I've been wanting, or something I'm surprised at, or something I've got one of and I'm pleased to see another. Don't remember]. (199 words)

I'm setting off on a trip in my car [much as I actually plan to do] and I need to stop at Lori's karate school. She and the teacher are going to be late this morning and somebody's got to open it up for some ladies who take an early class. It's a nice quiet morning, grayish before the sun's properly out, crisp. I drive up the semicircular drive where there's a bit of canopy entrance. (Not fabric - it's that the door has a projection-thingy over it, I don't know what to call it.) There are like yucca plants in the landscaping. Looks very homey for a karate school. I'm early, so I wait for a bit, then they show up. I let them in and Lori and her teacher also show up, earlier than they'd figured, and they invite me in for a visit before I go. I stay in the car for a minute or two, checking out the steering wheel, which is giving me a bit of trouble, you know I just had some work done on the front end, I hope there's not still a problem. Well, by Jove, I discover the steering wheel is just barely being held on by one rather "sprung" spring. It has been operating, though, so far, but I know I can't expect to get much farther with it in that condition. I really don't want to delay my trip any further but geez it really looks like I'd better. That thing could just pop off any time. I go inside to see what I can see. One thing about this school is there's a lot of cats about. Actually they sort of raise cats here, and there's one that's blind. I've heard about him but never actually met him. Or her. Now I'm in this room here, and by George here's this cat! He/she is white, shorthaired, has a nice sturdy body, round head, sweet face, and no eyes. Just not there. A slope of fur where the eyes should be. I'm a bit taken aback, but I'm fascinated. I'm also aware that this cat is considered very wise, and now I understand why. He/she just sort of radiates wisdom. I'm glad to be here with it. I get up on the ledge/cushion/whatever that the cat is sitting on - she just came here and calmly situated herself - she doesn't seem to need eyes to see. She makes a kind of trilling sound, and then says, "Come up, ____" (speaking the name of another cat who's come up to the place we're sitting). I can't even see the other cat and didn't hear it come up, but she knew it was there and wanted to come be with the white cat. I'm just a little surprised at hearing her speak at all, but I have such a profound respect for her that it doesn't seem odd at all. I am just amazed and awed, and while I'm surprised at the depth of my reaction to her, I'm enjoying the feelings so much, it doesn't matter. (510 words)

I'm supposed to marry Michael J. Fox (or Alex Keaton - the whole family is in this) and I'm at their house meeting this young woman who's a bridal consultant or something, she's come to interview us, to plan the wedding. Actually Alleycat's father is a minister, and he's going to perform the ceremony. Part of their house is a chapel - actually it seems to be a separate house, but somehow I think it's used for more than just services. It's a pretty place, lots of trees and green shade, a sort of ranch-style house on one level, and the chapel is higher, you have to walk up a few steps - they both face the driveway and the chapel's on the right as you face them. [It reminds me of that barn-sort-of place in Edom - maybe it used to be a barn.] Very idyllic setting. I've come up to the walkway to the chapel door (which is open and you can see inside - there are family members about, the father and daughters) with the consultant and we've sat down on a bench to talk. She gets out a notebook and asks where we want to have the service, and I tell her about this place, and how Alleycat's father will do the ceremony. She asks me who else is in his family, and I start describing them, and when I'm talking about his sister Mallory, I start to say her age is 20 [which I guess it isn't yet, in "real" life] and then I think maybe I shouldn't say that because then Alleycat's age will come up and she may not like that. But I say it by accident anyway and the consultant [she, by the way, has dark hair, sort of a professional medium-long do, and a suit - she's probably younger than I am] does ask about Alleycat, and I sort of fumble about that and say he's 24, no, 26 I think, dah dah dah. Now she knows how old I am, and does in fact look askance at this, and asks me if everybody's amenable to this. They are, oh yes, I like the family and they like me, and Alleycat and I are really in love. There are some lingering apprehensions all around, but nothing so serious. (338 words)

I've just driven up to a restaurant - a garden-y sort of place, set into some trees, the entrance faces sideways from the street and the parking is in the back. Close to the back of the building, you can drive up to a sign that has on it who's dining there at the moment. [I don't know, actually, why I've come there, but it seems like I meant to meet somebody.] I drive up to the sign and am delighted to see Adam 's name on it, somewhere in the middle. [In fact I clearly see his first name, but the last isn't clear in my mind.] I figure Jane and Ken must be there with him, so I'll get to see them. Hooray! So I'm parking the car, and I go inside. [Whatever happens next, I don't go all the way in and see them, I think - somehow I go through the rear entrance and past the dining room, to the main entrance.] This is a nice place, classy but not snooty, a bit countrified. Lots of windows and air, but not bright lights. A muted, greenish atmosphere. I go out the main entrance and pause for a minute while I do [something or other - something in here about some people greeting me, I haven't seen 'em in a while, all very jolly, happy to see each other, making quick plans to meet later] and set down my purse on a ledge at the top of the step. I go on down the steps and turn toward the parking lot, and somebody calls out to me that I've forgotten my purse (from behind me? where?). I look up to see that a guy is picking up my purse, and it appears he means to make off with it - I shout at him, "Put that down!" and actually he does, but he does it rather casually and he opens it up and looks in it. (It's my regular purse, by the way.) He takes out the cash that's in there, and also (I think) my card case. He looks at me, smirking, and starts to walk off - going across the front of the restaurant's lawn through some trees toward the street. I start to chase after him, and he runs, but hasn't got far, so I catch him and grab his hand. I swing him around, hauling as hard as I can, and twist, and maybe I've even broken his wrist. He falls down and I hit him. (325 words)

I'm watching a film - TV, I think - with a bunch of other people, and it seems sort of - oh, teenage-pregnancy-and-why-you-shouldn't-get-married-and-have-kids - or even just have kids - film, and what they're doing is that there's some sort of party scene, it's a large, Latin sort of family, Mexican possibly, and a young girl and young boy and baby, and parents, and grandparents and all that, and they have one scene after another of people interacting with each other; and what you see is this boy and this girl who have got the baby, while they're with each other and with the baby, they look like they might be grownups or something, because you see couples like that - and when you get them with, for instance, her middleaged mother or his father, they are definitely still children. This you can get a sense of, just from seeing how they interact with each other. I'm actually watching them with this same family, and then when it's over with we go into their - I guess, living room - they live in an apartment - I think it's across the street from me; I'm a neighbor and I visit; and so we all sort of file into the living room - we're just talking about things in general, and the talk comes around to taxes. There's a little old woman there - your basic little old woman, short hair, crabby voice, wrinkled face, grey hair - and she's talking about how the new tax things that are going into effect right now are really bad because it looks like you're going to get some sort of a break at first, but then what'll happen is everything will end up being more expensive and you'll end up going backwards. And some of us agree with that [runes? - can't get this] - your general sort of conversation, people nod their heads and say "uh-huh", yeah, it's bad; and I was just there, you know, just being neighborly basically.

(After waking up, resetting alarm, and going back to sleep) Alleycat and Tree are watting for me for breakfast - and I hear noises [I think that actually happened once]. I got up and I'm in the "den" and notice something's missing. It's the bookcase. It's gone altogether. Somebody must have broken in, but I didn't hear anything. I'm stunned. [After a space of time - don't know what happened] I come into the living room and look around. The usual stuff is gone again - TV [not in the right place], tape deck, etc. - the bookcases are mostly empty, there's more emptiness in the room than there should be. And I notice the door's standing open - it's bright daylight, not very cold, I'm surprised Alleycat didn't go out. Now that seems very unusual. Seems to me Alleycat would have gone outside, and probably run away. [That's when things started to get mixed up with reality.] I feel sort of shocked, and a little betrayed. I pull the door shut, wondering if this is real or a dream. [I go back to bed?] When I come back into the living room, the front wall has changed to brick and the room is mostly empty. Now I'm really confused. This is still my apartment, isn't it? It looks like the wall of a hall or clubhouse or something - marks on it, corners of posters, worn red brick. I stand next to it, trying to remember if it was brick before and I just forgot, or what's going on here? (227 words)

Walking somewhere - not conscious of where, but outside in a non-built-up area, where there are trees and a highway bridge - bit of construction going on, I think. But it's been raining and continues to, and it's flooding. There are some other people walking along here - I think we all have the same goal, more or less, but we're not together. At least I'm not part of the others as a group, but I don't think they're all a group. We're aiming under the bridge (there's no traffic on it), and the water is rising. I guess there's a bit of creek here, and there's a good bit of dirty water rising here. It's not so hard to walk in it, and I wouldn't have chosen this, but there's nothing to be done about it, or to get worried about yet. Now the water's up to my neck, but it doesn't seem to be getting any higher, at least. So we'll keep on slogging. (166 words)

I'm in a dress shop, upstairs in an open shopping mall and looking at stuff on sale, particularly a heavy sweater [that's a lot like the ones at Emeralds to Coconuts I looked at Thursday after work]. I hold it up to me in front of a mirror and I think it's likely to be too small, but maybe not. So I try it on over my clothes, and actually it does fit, sort of. Maybe it isn't so great, but okay. By the way, there's bright sunshine outside, the light against the big front windows looks yellow. This sweater is kind of boxy, just hip length on me, and it has two yarn drawstrings around it - I know they're meant to be at the waist, but on me they're in the middle of my stomach. I reflect on how this sweater was meant to look on somebody much smaller than me; it wouldn't look just "okay" - somebody meant it to look really good, I expect, I've got mindtalk - I shouldn't even have this sweater on - I'm too fat - I should be ashamed of myself. I'm on a street, sidewalk, aiming to catch a bus - it'll be coming soon, but I don't have the 25 cents fare, and I've just about got time to dash down the block to this neighborhood bar I've just been in - I know Chris 's in there, he just came in right before I left, he'll have a quarter. The place is [a lot like the Cedar Pub] in an old house, and all very friendly - lots of jolly people, some playing darts, Sunday-afternoon visiting, that sort of thing. I don't see Chris right away, but I go forward and keep looking - there are different rooms - and run into David Rathvon, who is just as pleased as Punch to see me, and makes a big deal. He is roaring drunk (a very unusual state for him) and says, yeah, sure, he has a quarter, come on in here - going around to one of the side-front rooms, where some of his friends are, and he introduces me all around. There's a separate bar-counter in here, and they've got a free "buffet" - which consists of soup (vegetable, I'm sure, reddish in color) and something else in another pot. I figure the object of this is to help calm down the drunks, and somebody does in fact encourage My cousin to have some soup. (It may take 'em a while, from the looks of things.) And he doesn't have a quarter, either, but somebody else offers one and I go on out to make the bus. I'd seen it way down the road when I ran down to the bar, and it's just here now, after I've been inside. [Actually I don't have this clear, but I definitely don't remember missing it.] I'm quite slim, by the way, and I'm wearing a sleeveless yellow flower-print dress, all very spring-y and girlish. I'm not sure I have any shoes on. I've gotten off the bus at some apartments - on my left, they're not new, but quite nice, maybe even elegant. Town-house-y. On my right I see trees, maybe even a park. I'm going to an apartment, I don't know that I live there, but I am at least staying there. A Jeep sort-of-vehicle comes down the street, one of those with sides and trimmings, a removable top. Loretta's in it with a young man, he's driving, he's a lot younger than she is, and very good-looking. Long hair, rather hip but not outrageous. I do think they've got something going on, and I'd like to know more about it. She looks very happy, anyway, and when she sees me, she waves and calls out - they can't stop because of the traffic, and they'll have to drive on a bit and make a U-turn, so they do. (627 words)

I'm with a group of people - I know most of them, one's Marcy. It's night, and the place is outdoors, but there are some kind of structures like huge sheds that we're in, quite finished out but still rustic. (The word "manger" comes to mind.) There's straw on the floor - maybe they most resemble the booths at the Faire. We're here to do something, I don't know what, but there are plans being made, we're getting organized for something. There's actually 2 of these sheds that face each other with some space between. Marcy's father is in one of them, he's quite ill, and there are medical people around for him. I'm near him, and he has some kind of attack or seizure, very serious. The medical attendants come to work on him - I'm trying to be some help, but there's not much I can do. I'm wondering where Marcy is, and if somebody's gone to get her. He could die any time now, and I guess she ought to be here. Well, since I'm just in the way, I'll go on over to the other side. There's a table, and some people (most everybody here is middleaged or elderly, but not all, I think), we're mostly just waiting. Next it's morning, and I'm just getting up - I'm in a house - either my house or Mom and Marcy's, it's a nice, neat, sort of 50's house, not a big place or fancy, but very comfortable and homey. I'm coming down the stairs (enclosed) and I run into Marcy - I almost think she's just coming in from last night, and I don't know what she's been doing, but I don't think she knows her father died. Actually I don't know myself, I'm not clear on what I remember from last night, but I do know he was about to die and couldn't have pulled through the night. I don't quite know what to say to her, in case nobody's told her anything. (337 words)

Waiting for a bus on a busy downtown street; I have my employee bus pass, homemade like our parking permits, and there's one other thing that I present to the bus driver. I wanted to make a copy of them to use this time, and keep the originals. (The main permit's red like the last parking permits.) There's a copy machine right next to the bus stop, and I see another woman about to use it, which is what reminds me to make the copies. I put my books (and something else) down on the sidewalk to do that. I go ahead of the other woman because she isn't ready (she's kind of a street person - stringy mousy hair, worn face, shabby tan coat) - the machine actually laminates them for you, too - costs a quarter. I go back to the spot where you get on the bus. There's some problem with a pair of my underpants, which I'm carrying in my hand; I drop them and they get mixed up with a small pile of lingerie that belongs to another woman (I don't know why it's there, unless - like my books - she just had to put it down to go do something else, Anyway, the bus comes and I'm fumbling to extricate my underpants, without seeming to be filching her stuff, too, and I have to scramble onto the bus. I put my purse and other things on the sideways seat behind the driver, and show her my copied pass. She's black, looks something like Lynn Moody - she's a little unsure about my pass, and I'm going to show her the original, and discover I haven't picked up my books (and whatever else) off the sidewalk. I say, Oh! hold on a minute, I'll be right back - the doors aren't shut yet - and dash outside to get them. The bus doors shut, and it starts up, slowly at first, almost as if she means to wait for me, then it moves on. I'm stunned - I thought she'd wait for me. I guess she means me to go on to the next stop down the block, but I'm still surprised. I hustle on down, knowing I might still not make it unless I run, and I can't run. But what I find is there isn't another bus stop close by, the bus is heading for the bus shed at the end of the street. I'm really worried, because even if I've got my books, my purse is on the bus, and my bus pass, and there's no way to get home without them. I hurry and reach the shed, which is kind of a main terminal like Union Station was, I guess, and I don't know where the bus is. This end of the place is not where the buses come, and I don't know how you get to the other end. I go through a door that seems to lead further forward, and I pass by what looks to be a locker- and workout-area. A couple of people - bus drivers, I guess, they have that look, like cops and other public servants do, like they have on uniforms even when they don't, who have just come from the showers or are going there - they have towels around their necks. One's a white female, dark hair with a perm, curly top and bottom, not big but physical looking (like bus drivers and cops often are), middleaged. I'm aiming at another door that leads outside and maybe further down towards the other end of the shed. (605 words)

I'm in the office (old-fashioned, all the desks in one room, more like Texlite was). I keep something in my desk - some papers, a computer printout? - that's a drag to revise - that's supposed to be kept locked up, and Byrdie and I keep the keys (which are shiny new brass keys, bigger like door keys). This other person in the office needs to see this stuff sometimes and Byrdie lends her the key if I'm not here, but the girl who's got that job is new (seems to be Cathy ) and before her there were others - they didn't stay long, and it was quite a nuisance. So now Byrdie's standing here saying "I think I'll give her my key and then I can get it from her when I need in there." I don't like this idea - my reaction is like I usually react to Byrdie - disgust, weary, plagued - another of her lame-brained ideas. There's somebody else here, female, I don't know who, but she has an interest in this and she's understanding of the workload in the office. I want her to know I think that giving the key to Cathy is risky, and I say so. I point out that she probably won't even stay very long. And I say, "I don't mean to actually expect her to leave soon, she only just got here, but after the others I'm just not optimistic." (Or words to that effect.) It's a pain getting keys made, too. I've been called somewhere by some guys in suits, and they're like CIA or something. I'm supposed to be doing some job for them, or providing information, but I don't know what and I'm rather disgruntled about it. One of them tells me not to worry about it, I'll be informed eventually but not right now. Another scene sort of SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM/Renaissance Fair - I go into a marquee tent on my way outside and Brenda's in there but she doesn't see me - she says to somebody she's been gone 18 months and for some reason she's out of sorts - I'm trying to stay out of her way before I get out.

I'm visiting Carol Burnett and Tim Conway, who are doing Mr Tudball and his secretary for some reason, sort of as a personal thing rather than for an audience. They're staying in this place, which is sort of like an old office building or a factory or warehouse, not currently in use. They've fitted out a couple of rooms as bedrooms, and fixed up part of it as the "office" set. And they just are spending their time doing the act - not exactly rehearsing, I don't think, but just being the characters. Anyway, I'm here visiting, and for the moment they're occupied and I'm just wandering around. I look into one of the bedrooms - I think it's Carol's - and I'm rather surprised at how it's furnished. It could be fifty years old, but I know they brought in their own stuff. It's a narrow room with plain walls and an institutional, wavy-opaque glass window on the left side of the far wall. No closet, but there's an old wardrobe on the left-hand wall, a bed on the right. And a nightstand, I guess, maybe a chair or a chest of drawers - anyway, there's only 1 or 2 other pieces of furniture. I like looking at it because of the nostalgia, but it's awfully drab. I go back out, and Carol and Tim have knocked off for a while and we (Carol and I, anyway) are going to walk around some. The "office" is left of my perception of the space, and between that and the bedroom is an opening to a hallway and a glass door, where I discover there's a way to the outside. I thought we were on an upper floor, but I guess not. So we stroll outside, and find ourselves in a large city park, at an open space, the sort where people play baseball, or run with their dogs. (The building has disappeared, and Carol Burnett has become Shirley MacLaine.) It's morning, the sun is shining, and there's some people about, not too many. We've been here a while, since early morning and there wasn't anybody here but us. (Counting a man, maybe another, who I can't identify, but who are like assistants - as Shirley MacLaine might even have.) We separate for a bit, just following our noses, and I come up to a large brick/concrete place, some steps, maybe there's a dry fountain, a place to sit or something - terrace-y. Nearer the trees. And suddenly I remember my purse. We left our purses on the ground earlier when we came, since there wasn't anybody around, we just walked off - we weren't going that far anyway, not out of sight. (Though we did spend that time inside the building.) And now here's all these people - I hadn't even realized this was happening. Now I'm scared, and I look for our purses. They're not where we left them - mine's separated from Shirley's - and I get mine, and look into it. It's as I was afraid of, it's all but empty inside. Checkbook, money, coin purse, card case, are all gone. The main section and front pocket are completely empty. I'm horrified and scream, "Shirley! Shirley!" And she and the others come running, and I just scream. (No words, not a shrill sound, but deep and from the gut.) I can't stop screaming. (566 words)

...I'm supposed to be getting on the bus, and I'm just finishing up something - I've been working hard and it's down to the wire and I'm determined not to make a mad dash for it, keep cool, stay in control, don't panic. The front of this place, at least, is a jumble of big things, like it's under construction, and I've left my jacket and purse and one or another things out here, I'd actually almost forgotten that. Everybody else has already gotten on the bus, including George - there's a lot of people I know here - maybe all of them - and we're working here on this big "project", I guess, and it's quitting time for the day. I just considered what I was doing crucial enough to stay to finish. But now I see I can make the bus (I think) if I don't waste any time, but I'm not gonna hurry. I collect my things, one by one, and make it to the bus door just as they're closing it. There are 2 guys at the door, bus uniforms, at least the "doorman" is black, very businesslike. The "doorman" opens the door for me again, and I get on. The bus is huge, and yellow. It's yellow outside and inside the seats might be gold or something, very elegant. This is a new bus, I'd read they were buying new ones, this is a neat thing - the seats are like coach seats, taller, deeper, and the center one of each bank is higher and has some antique-y looking trim. I thought it would be entirely filled up, but there are quite a few seats. I make my way to the back looking for where I want to sit and about the middle of the bus I drop something right next to Eric. As I get down to pick it up I see there's a seat open next to him and I wonder if he'll be disappointed if I don't sit there or if other people will think I should. But I don't want to, I want to sit and be quiet. I go on back - there's a kitchenette/bar on the right - that's neat - nobody doing anything there, though, maybe that's for special events. I find the back seat open (where I usually sit) - there's some litter on the seat, but this is fine. This bus is quite elegant, it's a trip being first ones on it. By the way, as I'm coming up to the bus, just in time: I'm aware that the people on the bus already are anxious for me to make it - there's no calling out or coaching or celebration when I do make it, but I know that they are sort of tensed up, mentally urging me on and there's a feeling of relief when I get there and the man opens the door for me. Earlier: I'm in a house, and there are 2 televisions - a woman and a man are there, and there's a special television show we all want to see. She decides to go to the other TV in another room where she's more comfortable, but (I'm interrupted and come back to find) she hasn't got the channel in clear. I check and discover it's because she changed it by the dial instead of the remote control - she goes to find it and I poke around. I find there are automatic scan switches like the remote has, and try those. It works better, but real slow. I haven't even gotten to that station by the time she gets back. Oh, yes, and in some scene or other I discover that the toe of one of my black boots has come apart - unstuck from the sole, it looks pretty seedy - I will surely have it fixed (it'll cost money, ooh) but right now I'm trying to hide it.

I'm pregnant as a surrogate mother - I'm maybe going to college, I have a lot of friends around who seem to be more or less my age and we seem to be together for something like college, we seem young but not kids. The mother is a friend of mine and I volunteered for this - it was an artificial insemination. Even with me carrying the baby, things are a bit precarious. I'm in the hospital (at least some of the time) because I'm somewhat at risk myself, it turns out. [Something else happens first, and now] it's night and my mom's here, she's getting ready to leave and the nurses and everybody else have gone. I'm kind of scared. It's dark already, the lights are out and my mom leaves. Now what happens if something goes wrong? It's a small, narrow room, looks real institutional, white, white sheets, white iron bed, high ceiling, and there's some kind of machine standing over the bed. I'm worried, and my body feels like something's not okay. After a while, things have changed - there was a problem, and they've transferred the baby from me to somebody else, another of our friends who volunteered. We're not in the hospital room now, but a place that I'm thinking of as a waiting room - it's large and has like couches and things, the light is dim like early morning or late evening but doesn't feel quite like either. The other girl's boyfriend is here, too, he wants to be close to her, help take care of her. And the first girl and her husband(?), and some other people. Actually more of us are arriving gradually until there's quite a lot of people here - all of us good friends, and we all have an interest in this baby. I'm not altogether out of this thing, it's as though I'm still connected, they didn't quite transfer all of the baby to the other girl, I'm still needing to be attended to and cared for even though I don't have to give birth myself. Actually, gradually it seems that we all - at least the women - are carrying "parts" of this baby. (Not "parts" as in body parts, but some other idea - can't explain it.) We're all quite anxious.

I am somewhere with a group of people, we're working on a project - there are buildings around, but they're farm- or village-type buildings, and we're out in the country. The sun is shining, more or less, it's not beautiful here but ok. The group I'm with is not all together, but we're in one general area and there are other people in the vicinity somewhere. I'm with a girlfriend, close to the end of the space where most of us are, and the buildings are all to the left of my perception, and there's a bit of road going that way. Down the road and past us come some vehicles, one of which is a large piece of equipment, either on a truck or it rolls by itself. It's white and strange-looking. We don't know what it's for, but the whole caravan looks sort of ominous. The people on and in the vehicles seem very somber and serious, not looking round or focusing on anything except going forward. They proceed into (and possibly through) an open building on the other side of the "village". (I guess it would have to be like a hangar or something.) My girlfriend and I are extremely curious about this. We look at each other, and decide to go investigate. We sneak up to the building and try to peek in the windows, then duck into an open door after seeing the coast clear. We're looking around (it's rather like a barn in here) but don't see the machine, just stable-y sort of partitions and the straw. It's pretty clean in here for a barn, not smelly, and very quiet. There must be people around someplace, though, and we're being stealthy. My friend thinks these people are Russians and something shady is going on, they're getting ready to pull some dirty deed. She says we could get into a lot of trouble if we were to get caught. She says if we should get caught, we shouldn't give our real names, and I could say mine is ____. I say that's rather complicated, I won't remember it. About this time we do get caught, by a threatening-looking (though attractive) blonde woman, who wants to know our business here. After first being startled, we stumble over some lame explanation and I say my name is "John". My friend looks rather surprised and so am I, but it was just what came up at the time. She (the woman) says that's a strange name and I start into some song and dance about how I got it as a nickname as a child. But she doesn't care and she's not at all sure about us, so she says we have to come with her, we'll have to straighten this all out elsewhere. Then she does some things and the back wall opens, showing a (truck?) and a lot of open country - not desert, quite, but pretty barren, and we know that nobody good lives that way. We're bundled into the truck (it's like a troop carrier) and driven away, and I start to panic. I know we're being taken to Russia, and nobody will be able to help us and they'll never believe we meant no harm and they'll never let us go. (548 words)

I've come to see Trisha but she's not home - I either need to pick something up or leave something. She's living in this smashing house that's not in a residential area but, as if you were in a small town with a small downtown area, like it was near the middle of that, next to like doctors' offices and that. The house is modern, maybe with stone walls or something, very high ceilings, lots of plants hanging and standing, open spaces broken up by dividers. I let myself in to do what I came for and I also need to pee. The toilet is not in its own room but in the bedroom area, and it has an extra lever - I don't know what it's for, but I pull it just to see, thinking it might have a bidet function or something. What it does is let down this fine mist from above, right in front of you as you sit on the toilet. It's very nice but I still don't know what it's meant to accomplish. There's a cat here, too, a nice gray striped one, who comes up to visit. While I'm still sitting, Trisha comes home. I wonder if she'll be okay with me coming like this, but she doesn't mind. (She actually came in very quietly and I was startled when she appeared suddenly.) Her hair is different - she's let the tail loose and maybe gotten a permanent, it's falling to her shoulders, fluffier and curlier - very pretty - I hadn't realized that so much of her hair was braided into the tail. Also while I'm here, Lynnette comes in - we've seen her park her car and come to the house through the big plate glass windows. Trisha tells me she's changed her name. [Can't remember to what.] She just got tired of the old one. (311 words)

I'm at a Training, in a house-y sort of place, maybe something else, but fairly old. The trainees are in a medium sort of room to my right, and I'm in a sort of team room, narrowish, no windows, yellowish light from fixtures - counters and chairs and stuff suggest the 30's or 40's. I'm having to do dinner for the trainers - John Boats and another unidentified man - and I'm in a bind because there isn't any food. I don't know how this situation came about, but it is and I'm pretty upset about it. For the last meal (it was just John) I had to cook one of my sweaters, and I don't want to do that again. I've got another one, a light green, I think it has a turtleneck, and I really like it, I don't want to give it up. I'm standing with it in my hands in front of the [cooker?] and feeling real sad. The only alternative is to go out and spend money, which I also don't want to do - I don't have much - but as I stand here I also realize how poor it would be to give them a cooked sweater again. I just can't do it. Damn. So I go to get my purse, which is in another room - the door leads into the back left corner of the room - and dash quietly across the corner to another door. This leads into a corridor, which has a telephone alcove in the middle and a door underneath. I think I had put my purse in the cabinet, but when I try to open it I find another door underneath - I know I haven't seen that before. So I go down to the room at the end of the corridor and retrieve my purse [my real one] where I left it on a table. (There's someone else in the room, and I'm aware that she/he would give me support if I wanted it, but I don't say anything.) I dash back across the training room (it reminds me somewhat of a Victorian parlor, and it's dim - only the trainers and trainees are in here, no staff) and back into the "team room"-sort-of-place. [When I wake I'm feeling really sad and down from all this, can't say why, but the feeling is very heavy.] (374 words)

I've been on a bus on my way to work and I get put off part way there when the bus breaks down. It's a hill, somewhat south of town, and I can see the space between. I'm late, of course, and going to be later. I'm nervous about that and decide to turn back rather than go in so late. Now I'm at my father and My stepmother's house - I seem to be staying here. It's a regular sort of suburban house. I don't have a key with me and I don't know if I can pick the lock or break the door in - and I don't want to be seen breaking in, but it turns out if I just jiggle the handle a bit and lift sideways, it opens - the lock parts are loose. [I go inside but I don't remember what I do there - something to do with the telephone.] (139 words)

I'm watching a film or tape taken from a helicopter, I suppose, of a city skyscraper all the way up to the roof where a singer - maybe an opera singer - is performing, singing to the sky in an evening dress. The "camera" passes over her and continues, showing the tops of other high buildings. [Some other things happen.] Now I'm in a car on a hill - it's night, been night all along - and I'm crying because I'm afraid to go up that high, I couldn't do what the singer was doing. The person I'm with hugs and consoles me. (99 words)

I'm living in this little cabin-y sort of house with the cats, and Linda's coming over later to go out [just as we'd planned] but I think I'll go for a walk or something, even though I have doubts about leaving. I live near a park sort of area with a creek and trees and people come there for fun, but it doesn't have facilities or signs. I go up this way and spend some time before I run into this girl. She's got short dark hair and is wearing slightly butch clothes - reminds me of Renee. She starts a conversation about the time I decide to go back, and keeps on asking me questions about myself. I think she wants me to say I'm gay but won't ask directly, and I'm just not volunteering the information. She follows me almost all the way back home before giving up (or I shake her, however it was). I'm a bit late getting back and Linda is already there with some other people, maybe a sister of hers and the sister's kids (teenagers), something like that. Something seems to be bothering them and I suddenly get scared that somebody's broken into my house again. I open the door carefully and look around, but everything's in place. They bustle around the way families will and I try to get it together so we can go where we're going. One thing is to get a bunch of stuff out of my purse that I've accumulated. This includes 3 different kinds of Band-Aids in tins, which fall over in the back compartment and the Band-Aids fall out. I'm real annoyed at this and the more I try to get them out easily without getting all mixed up, the more mixed up they get. I keep whining, "Damn" or "Shit" every time something shifts - not very entertaining for the guests but I'm pretty frustrated and don't care. To add to the problem, somehow I spill water into my purse, which will ruin everything. ----I get organized finally and we leave - we go somewhere like a museum, where we've seen something and there are attendants around and on the way out we get sort of hung up talking to them - I have some sort of problem getting my shoe or some part of my clothes caught on something on a man who's with us. There are more of us now, including Lynn and Dan - we're actually doing something besides visiting, we're using what we've just seen in some way. The blonde daughter is trying to hurry us up so we can get started with our project, which involves portable computers - we're setting them up in the lobby, sitting on the couches there and working at something - but mine isn't working right. It's taking some of the numbers I've put in and repeating them elsewhere on the screen at odd angles, where they fade and drift off the screen. I clear it and start again, but it does the same thing - I tell the others and they share my concern that if it's the computer that's doing it, it could damage my disk. One more try - it gets worse, finally putting all sorts of random numbers on the screen. Later I'm at Lynn and Dan's house with Tree - we've gone into the back yard (it's night) and Tree gets out of the house and runs across the yard and I run to catch him. (582 words)

With MacGyver and a little girl - she's in danger, we're all escaping from the bad guys. Went through a church at one point, like the back hallways, passed by at least one clergyman, typical black suit - just sort of said hi on the way downstairs. Outside on the street, there's some kind of festival going on, and we're dodging the bad guys by disappearing into the crowd. We wind it up, finally, getting away altogether or something, and we're in a room in what I think is a little house. There's a window and a couple of beds, we're tired and emotionally exhausted. Turns out the kid doesn't actually have anywhere to go, and we've all bonded in this whole thing; MacGyver says he wants her to stay with him, and she wants to, they'll be like father and daughter. I'm feeling very left out since I don't fit into this scene - I'm not Mother, and I'm not his girlfriend or lover, that's not what I want from him. What I want is for him to be my daddy too - I really hurt at the idea of being on my own with no one to love me. I go over to the bed he's on (sort of just relaxing back, not sitting sideways or actually lying down) and kneel by it - I can't speak, I'm so full of longing and sadness and pain I don't even know how to say what I want, so I just stay there looking at the floor.

First scene: I'm at an SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM event somewhere outside, but with buildings, smallish, like park buildings; the ground is not level where I am - this may be a tournament, probably is, but I'm not where the event is currently happening. I'm actually returning from it, walking away from whatever the action is, back to fetch something from (my own cabin? or tent? or elsewhere?) or maybe not. There's an element of leaving but it not being public knowledge. I may be with someone else, another female. On the way I pass by a couple of gentlemen (we're all dressed up, these two are quite fine, the one who seems to be superior is dressed mainly in black, quite Renaissance with puffed sleeves, white shirt, puffed hat and pants). We don't say anything to each other beyond "Good day" or something. I'm going uphill. Second scene: A large resort/summer camp, lots of people here, lots of each, visitors and staff. Staff are like graduates or something, who've been here a lot, and act a lot like seniors in high school, sort of superior, swaggering, smart-aleck, but not too serious. I'm new, with a bunch of girlfriends, just checking in and getting oriented. We walk across to this building that might be a dining hall, with a screened porch/entry. (The sun is shining, quite bright, it's nice here, a beautiful summer day in the woods - there may be a lake in the distance. The place has rather large buildings for a camp, typical white-sided wooden.) Inside we run into Bruce Willis, who is on staff here - he's doing his familiar smartass number, trying to impress us, and he talks particularly to me, and asks me for a date. I'm not sure I heard him right, and he says, "Yeah, right, I mean it, you and me (something or other)". I'm surprised and pleased. Third scene: Perhaps an extension of the last one - I've left the camp in a car with a couple of other people, a man and a woman. We may be returning to the city on purpose, or maybe we're just out for a ride and decide to come this way, but withal we're aiming at downtown Dallas from the west, across the Trinity [the names were not used in the dream], and find our way blocked. At first we find the road we're on doesn't go through; then I suggest going on north a bit, where I know we can get through. But as we do that, we come to another dead end. At some point in this, it becomes a chase. Someone is after us, I don't know who. We have to stop at this old building that might have been a plant or any number of other things, it's brick, institutional-looking. I've gone to schools with aspects like this. The back of it is where we are, with no door at ground level, but there's one down below, where there's a (former) set of concrete stairs from ground level and a retaining wall. Except that the stairs have been covered up to keep people from coming down here. It looks as if they poured concrete or something to fill them up, and smoothed off the top. Then there's something black and tarry/greasy on top of that. But it looks like the only thing to be done, get down there and try to get in the door. The guy goes down first, sliding down like on a ramp. He has now turned into Bruce Willis. The other woman goes, and now it's my turn and I don't want to; I have my white dress on and that black stuff will ruin it. Oh, hell. But there's no help for it, so down I go. We get inside, it's a match for the outside, dark, dirty, old, unused. Fourth scene: (Continuation) I'm with Bruce in this place, [we don't seem to have any plans except to hide out] and a bunch of college students come in. I can't say what it is, but there's something not right about them, like sinister, and some of the time they refer to college in terms that better describes a church. In fact, one of them says "the church" instead of "college" once. Bruce is suspicious and wary, wound up in case something happens. I'm nervous and wanting to be held and comforted. I snuggle up against him [wherever it is that we're sitting together], wriggling as if to get behind him. He doesn't like it. (737 words)

I'm on top of 2 square tables, way up in the air. The table tops are like the ones we have in the staff rooms at the library - only they're on these long poles, I guess they're embedded in the ground but I can't see. [Estimating in real time, I may be 3 stories or more in the air.] I'm outside, what I can see is lawn and there are some trees nearby but I'm not looking around. Down below is a living-room chair upholstered in a print of some sort, and Donald from the Water Department is sitting in it. What's going on is some kind of test, or teaching-thing, like part of a workshop, where this is a physical challenge like the "ropes" or something. I'm the last one to do this, out of a group of people I mostly know. They've mostly gone, [I don't know whether they've gone home or inside somewhere - this seems like a huge backyard, or the grounds to a large house or building] and I can only see Donald and one other girl, who's finishing something up and getting ready to leave. [I don't know how I got up here, but I'm laying down on the table tops on my stomach.] I'm in that sort of repressed-panic state, where I know I'm scared but I'm not allowing myself to scream or express it; just wide-eyed stunned apprehension. I'm mostly on one of the table tops and I roll over to sort of straddle the center and hold onto both equally. I'm looking down at Donald and he's looking back at me - he's not actually saying anything right now, but what he's there for is to be my partner, or support, and I'm not sure what that means but he'll definitely be here while I'm up here. That helps. [I'm not aware of anything I'm supposed to do while I'm here except stay put, but I'm pretty sure I'm expected to do something besides just wait it out.] Just now I'm beginning to wonder if these tables will sway (like you might expect them to), or maybe separate under me and I'll be in a pretty awkward position.

I'm standing in front of a pantry [?]...as opposed to the kind you walk into, I think I meant...small closet in the kitchen, in a small house. The cat food is supposed to be at the bottom, on the floor of this pantry, in a rubber container, kinda like the cat litter**. What's here, at the moment, is there's cat food scattered on the floor where it's been left, as a mess. But dry cat food is stacked, if you will - really - on the right side next to the wall, as though, you might imagine, there would be a dispenser or something - but the dispenser isn't there any more, and it's in the same position. And I'm scooping up the bits, just to neaten things up, and I also notice some yellow liquid on the floor. [?] And I check it out, I'm assuming that it's cat pee, and I'm assuming that Alleycat did it, and I'm taken aback. When I check it out, touch it, it turns out to be oily and it doesn't smell, and what it turns out to be is dripped oil from one of the bottles on a lower shelf, on the floor. Things are generally kind of messy here. Now, the reason this is unusual is that in the other room, Bettye is talking to a guy that has just cleaned this place. He's kind of on the dark and swarthy side, kind of stocky, burly. He has just taken over from the guy who was doing it before, and his price is in question. It was kind of like George's thing; he had a price, raised the price, somebody else came in and lowered the price. It was like $25 to $35, and $30; and now this guy wants $33, and Bettye is hesitant about it - she's not wanting to give him 33, and there's something in it about she doesn't actually have it - I mean, she does have it, but we're kind of stretching around here. And he's explaining to her, you know, how things are, and that he needed the extra $3, and he's sort of implying that it was more work here, or something. But then in fact what I'm seeing is that he's not doing as good a job. There's like, what I'm seeing in this pantry, and elsewhere. I'm in the pantry, overhearing this, feeling kinda guilty, because of the cat food and stuff, thinking that it's my fault and that I ought to be taking part, you know, kicking in for the money - or more, anyway - I'm not actually sure how we distribute it. Bettye is kind of the head of the household, and in some respects she's running this particular thing. I kind of think Bettye is a substitute, too. And where we are is something on the order of a college neighborhood and I have just previously been in @ a scene in a place that's something like a dorm, only it's not in a building, it's like a cabin, more-like arrangement, where you're on the ground floor anyway, and have a porch, and I'm outside on the porch trying to communicate with my mother through one of those wooden necklace-things that I got from the Library Store, the Philippine things. We discovered that we could talk to each other over them; and I may be looking at this place wanting to rent it - maybe even for both of us. (Not real sure about that.) But I go out on the porch, and I seem to be facing a big group of buildings, they're kind of like Fair Park, or a college - THE UNIVERSITY just crossed my mind, too - and the atmosphere is interfering, or something; I speak to her once, and we make connection, and then I'm talking and I realize that she's not answering back, and then I can't hear the same sound that I had, and I try to get her back, and it's not working. There's a guy here, present, and I don't know what his involvement is right now, but he's part of this. He's a young, nice-looking guy, tall, dressed casually. (I don't know what I'm doing with him, exactly.) ***There was also another communication problem earlier; I kept trying to call this other [Elsa's? offices?] extension, I think it was my mother, on the office phones - there's even a switchboard here of some description, and I keep getting a wrong number. I haven't looked it up to verify what it is, and I keep being absolutely sure I've got it, and I call, get the wrong number, hang up immediately, and the person on the other end of the line is very angry. Or somewhat angry, anyhow - and the last time, even starts to threaten that she's going to call somebody to investigate. She names a party - not the police, and not the telephone company, I don't think; but in any case I'm certainly alarmed about this - not that logically, she can actually trace a call that was like that, when all it is, is just a brief connection and then hanging up - so, I don't know what that's about.

I'm sitting in a cafe with a couple of other - I think women - yeah - and we're next to the window, on the street - we're in a booth. And there's a factory, or some sort of plant, across the street (it's not a very wide street). There's an alarm going off in the place across the street, and somehow I know that the thing is gonna blow up - or something's gonna blow up over there, and it's all very ominous. Nothing is actually happening right away, but [...?...] then suddenly there's a light in one of the sections closest to the street, really not precisely where I thought things were gonna be happening from, and - it's funny, it's as if I can see this happening even though I'm getting under the table - we decided it would be the better part of valor to duck. The light starts out small, and then grows to a flash, and then something goes boom, and then we say "Uh-oh", and crouch down under the table. And we cover our heads with our arms, like we did when we were in school, anyhow, and I'm not entirely sure this is gonna do the trick 'cause it's liable to be a pretty big explosion. (213 words)

I'm talking to Wayne, we're at work but it looks neither like the real office or the real library. The whole place is open and people bustle around - though it's not crowded - I'm reminded of a newspaper. Anyway, I've caught him for a moment and explain how I'd like to combine the parking lists into one file (it seems he does something with parking himself and that contributes to it being awkward) so it can be a lot more efficient and easier to use. He's dubious about this, but says, yes, well, okay, I guess, we can do that...other kids, one girl, one boy. The girl was sitting at the desk before, (we're close to the left-hand wall) but got up a while ago, and I'm working with some stuff off to the left of it. It's awkward, and I move it up to the center of the desk and sit up at it. She's coming back, and I ask her if she needs to be here, but she says no, and I ask some question about what I'm doing and she helps me out. [She is or reminds me of somebody but I can't place her - I keep thinking of Gail , but it's more than that - probably a combination of people but there's something nagging at me about it. A particular name that should be there.] There's a computer here, she's been using it, and I think I'll poke at it a bit, but I can't get the hang of what she'd been doing. She shows me, it's something like, hit "a", then "b", then "a", "b" again, etc., then maybe "c", but I don't get it right. I'm frustrated. [ - the way I was over the dBase the other day, when I was wanting to do something with the parking lists.]I'm in a car, with a couple of other girls, on our way to a "fair" - seems like a State Fair, and we're going to be on "team" rather than just going to it. As we pull into the parking area for participants, we meet some others and get out of the car. Shortly a group of other vehicles shows up and blocks us in on all sides - the car, I mean - and when I want to get something out of it I can't get to it without climbing through a truck - I look all around and get thwarted each way, then climb through. Shortly after, I'm with several others in a place a bit beyond the cars, where we're hanging out and sitting around on various things. I'm on something suspended like a swing from some structure - it's not really supposed to be a swing but it moves like one and I'm just perched on it and getting it to move back and forth, it's fun - I keep going higher, possibly not a good idea - liable to knock into something. But I keep doing it, using body English to get it moving the way I want, and now I jog a little bit and start swinging in a wide arc to the left. I certainly didn't mean to be going this far, but I don't seem to be able to stop. I'm not going all that fast - as a matter of fact it's almost like slow motion - but I'm rather high up and there's nothing to grab onto or jump off onto. As I swing backward, I have to be careful not to slam into some screens that are on the back of where we are - there's a fence, but the screens form some sort of structure that would be quite awkward to explain if they got busted up. I can reach out and slow myself down and keep out from them, but I keep on going and bump into some other stuff all the way behind, and I come to the apex of the swing and go back the opposite direction. Coming back to the front, I go past where I started and swing over to the right, where I bump into a piece of furniture, it's like a sideboard/hutch or something, old, weathered, and I don't knock it down, but stuff on it, and maybe something next to it. Glenda is standing at it, she's doing some chore there or other, and she doesn't get excited or even react, but I know she doesn't approve. I just look at her sheepishly. Otherwhere [this may have been on the way to the fair, maybe not], I'm in a car, the place is in a town, an old place, very close in, very ethnic, a lot of adobe or some such substance. We get stopped by a cop* on some technical thing, and he lets us off with a warning after we explain it was something we didn't know or couldn't help. I can see across the intersection the tail end of a small parade, going down a sort of alley - walls on each side. What I see is some people dressed like Middle Eastern types, robes, turbans, sandals, and a donkey or two, with leaves or something hanging off of them. Later on, I'm in the car, next to the passenger door, somebody in between, my father's driving, and there's a couple of others in the back seat. We get stopped again by the same cop, he's tall, male, and black, a nice guy, sort of a park ranger type. (Probably not the same thing we got stopped for before, but also a technicality.) However, he's got to be someplace else, and he turns us over to another cop, who is a white, blonde woman with curly hair. (881 words)

I'm in a sort of lobby, or part of a store, an old-looking place (I can't see what furniture there is, but there is something in the space - not high, but lower than waist level anyway - probably some chairs) - maybe as old as 100 years, but could be anything up to the Forties - darkish, daylight outside - as if it were hot outside and you leave the lights off to keep it cooler? Anyway, I've come in here to use the pay phone, but it either isn't working or I can't make the connection for some reason. I find somebody's wallet; I ask somebody about it who's nearby (salesman? don't know), and he says Michael Dukakis was just here, with some other guys (attendants), it's probably his, maybe you can catch him. (Actually I don't go after him, but) he and his entourage come back through the inside door - it's like an opening to another store or restaurant or building, etc. I tell him about the wallet, and he says it isn't his. I'm puzzled now. (181 words)

I've got to go somewhere, and I'm undecided whether to go on the bus or not. I drive my car for a while, then decide it would be better to go on the bus. I stop - this is an urban area, but not downtown - and think I'll pick up the bus here. But then I realize this isn't a good place to leave my car that long, they'll tow it away. So I go back to where I started from, where I know I can leave the car, but now I realize I'll be in trouble getting back to it. The bus goes to the garage on the return journey, and it's halfway across downtown from here (which is, like, the edge of downtown, the outskirts - I guess I work around here). I'd have to walk a pretty fair distance, and it'll be late. Yuck. Now I'm thinking maybe it would be better if I go back where I stopped before. But the bus will be here soon. Can I make it there before the bus does? I have serious doubts. I mean, what if I get held up? I'd miss it altogether, and if I stay here I know I'll get it. (206 words)

I've just come through a house [I've forgotten whose - a man, someone we know well and work closely with, we're close to him, a relative?] and come to the bathroom, a tiny one with a shower stall. In it is a friend of mine, who I call by name [Greyraven? Bill W? Somebody on the slender, and I think shortish, side - I'd previously been dreaming of Harry Anderson, may be a variation on him, but he's taller] and I announce with glee, "Guess what? I've finally used up all the water in the shower - that is, I've run all the water through that shower head, and now we can get a new one!" Hooray. This is neat, you know? You see, the old shower head is somehow unsatisfactory, it's old and worn, won't put out a steady stream of water or something, and we've been wanting to improve on it. So now we can get a nicer one, brand new, that'll work better. And (the guy I'm talking to) he says, you know what else? We could actually extend this bathroom, just by moving the wall out - we could double its size. So we go look out the window in the shower stall [by the way, he was just in there shaving at the sink or something] - outside there's a pretty big parking lot, with the sort of carports you see at old restaurants and other places, corrugated roofs held up by steel posts, for 2 cars to park nose-to-nose. It extends from this 1st row just across from the window to the front of the building, with lots of space between. This is a part of town where you might find such things, reminds me of down Lamar where Automotive used to be. The house is old, and while it's not ramshackle, is no showpiece either. Comfortable, though, and a lot of people come here. Actually I think a goodly number live here. I'm concerned for a minute about this extending the bathroom out into the parking lot, it would come almost if not all the way to the 1st parking slot there, then how would people walk by to the front? [The building makes a bit of an "L" beyond us to the left, the back of the building, and the back door's used all the time. By the way, beyond the carport - it's maybe eight cars deep - there are trees, maybe there's a creek down there. Forward, to our right, you see the other couple carports, then a bit of sidewalk and street - probably dead-ends; there's a car-parts-looking place across the street.] But then I think, no, really, it wouldn't be any big deal to give up one parking space on the end [2, actually], since the whole lot is seldom filled up anyway. This 1st strip usually is, though. Like I said, there are always a lot of people in and out of here. Anyhow, we see how it would be a very workable thing to extend the bathroom, very nice, we'd like it a lot. (379 words)

This place is very mixed up between work and home. Pat is here, there are people here that I work with, but also I have a little apartment here with 2 other girls, one of whom [I think] is Trisha. I've just come back to this apartment, it's very small, and Pat is with me, and I see that Trisha has just furnished the place suddenly. This is great, I don't know how she did it, but we certainly needed the stuff, and she's even got a Christmas tree! A small one, already decorated, it's by the big front window. I'm very pleased and excited, and I'm saying, now what can we do to add something to this [by the way, I'm also very grateful to Trisha], and I suddenly think, Oh boy! Yeah! Sure, neon! We'll put (blue) neon lights in the window! (I'm thinking of sort of a frame, it'll make the tree real noticeable. Pat is also pleased with all of this, well, you girls are sure getting along well, glad to see you so enthusiastic, really getting into it. [Whatever "it" is.] [Actually the place is seeming like a dorm now.] (Another scene:) I'm looking at a piece of paper that I've found on the ground - it's a receipt, or something related to something I've been doing, outdoors here, it's something like a fair, and this has to do with jewellery. Perhaps it's a pickup slip or something, and the girl who lost it will need it to get her thing, whatever she bought. (I think she's black.) I know it relates to some things on this bulletin board, here at this booth I'm standing next to. It's one of a row of booths, all facing a sort of grassy mound and an open space, on the other side of which is something else, perhaps the stage in the 1st dream. I take down this bulletin board from the counter and look for the list (of purchasers?). Meanwhile, there's an announcement about something from across the field. I'm not finding what I'm looking for, and getting distracted by the noise. There are a couple of paper pockets with a lot of slips of paper in them, in the middle of the board slightly right of center. It should be in here if it's not tacked up by itself, and I don't see it. I'm getting a little frustrated now. I've leafed through them several times. Finally I take out the whole batch of the ones on the right and see that some have been crumpled down in back, and the one I want is there. There's been some kind of crime, theft probably. I'm not on (the grounds?) and there are a lot of people about, when this announcement is being made about it. The fact that I'm the inventory clerk is of interest here - I'm explaining to a girl standing nearby (she's got long dark straight hair, I don't know her) that I deal with the furniture and equipment. I'm with Lori, we've been doing something (working) together in this building that's a cross between work and home, and she's about to leave (for the day, I think). She says Renee wants to talk to me, she'll be along shortly, and I say ok, but I've got to do something first. I go down this open passageway to a sort of office. When I get down to the end of the passageway, I see Lori and Renee through the window - or opening, it's not a window with a frame and glass - and they're going away, I guess Lori's going home and Renee will be back. In the office I talk to this woman, she's got short curly blonde hair and is a sort of police officer. She asks me some questions and my answers confuse her. I was asked to come here and was a little apprehensive about it, but I see there's nothing much I can do to help. [This situation blends into the next one, I think - the policewoman may even be the shop owner or manager.] While I'm talking to the blonde woman, Renee comes up, waiting, and I tell her I'll be here for a bit and come along shortly, why doesn't she wait in my room? I notice her hair is rounder and fluffier than usual - still short, but a sort of bubble-do, she looks "cute" and girlie-er. I see that where we are there are toys, novelties, cute little things (this seems to be taking place in a little bitty gift shop) - I'm finished with the blonde woman and I start to look at these things. I'm having a good time looking at these toys, one of them is something I already have, too. After a while it occurs to me that Renee is still waiting on me, I'd better get back. (778 words)

In a big building - church, library? - with a lot of people dressed up - church, I think. Right now I'm walking with some people - couple of friends, maybe - and I've got on a red outfit that I just borrowed from somebody. Someone notices up near the ceiling a bird - real high ceiling, the place is stone or whatever, not wood - we look up and it's a cardinal. Well, it doesn't need to be in here, for sure - I decide to take it outside, I climb up on something and hold out my hand. It comes down to perch on my hand and I very carefully take it down and walk out with it, my friends coming along. We come to a more open space with more people, it's the church proper and just before or just after service. Once or twice the cardinal flies off my hand and I hold it steady and it comes back. I'm talking gently to it. I see my grandfather and some other people I know, we stop to let them look at the bird briefly. Then we carry on as the building widens out and opens up, then there's no more walls, then no roof and we're almost, then all the way outside, and the bird sees it and flies away. It's all green trees and lawn here, pretty. All very Sunday morning, even Easter-y. Anita lives out in the country somewhat - has she retired, or is she commuting? She has a metal box, jewellery or notepaper, and it's maybe aluminum, like those ice buckets and tumblers from the 40's and 50's, all ornate, flowery things on top like a candy box. There's some driving involved, from this little house way out here down the road a piece to somewhere else - I'm wondering if I'd like to live out here and drive to work this way - could I make a living out here?

I come into a small room (small for this purpose, anyway) to a board meeting. The board table is at the far end, raised a bit, I guess it's on a stage or riser, and takes up almost all of that space. The rest of the room has folding chairs in it and they seem to be all filled. This room is pretty crude, as though it's in one of those temporary buildings you see at churches and schools. Flimsy siding and panelling, cheap doors, etc. I'm supposed to be at the table though I'm not at all comfortable about it - perhaps I'm a sub for somebody else. I make my way up to the table - it's rectangular and set shortwise on the stage. (126 words)

I've just arrived at schoold-typical-looking schoold, could have been elementary, junior high, or high school, old building, large schoolyard, chain-link fence, trees. It's morning, daylight, I've just gotten out of a vehicle and stepped onto the sidewalk, ready to walk across the grounds to class. Someone has just started off before me and I see he's veering right a bit, and as I start to take a step I suddenly realize the yard is all mud. It apparently rained last night, and everywhere I see is all smooth mud. I look for the best path and notice that the footprints are all pretty shallow, so it seems it must have dried up rather a lot. Well, okay, I'll go on across. I'm very much concerned about my clothes, though - I'm wearing white running shoes, and I realize they can be wiped off. But I also think I'm wearing white pants, and all my clothes are neat and clean, and I'm quite anxious not to get spots on them. As I walk across, carefully, I think about those little spatters you get from the tips of your toes, so I try to turn my toes out a bit. And now I've made it across. By the way, I'm not actually a student here. I'm undercover, pretending to be a student to investigate something (I don't know what). I have a partner - I'll be getting in touch with her later on. Now that I'm across, I realize I'm late. A number of us are, and there are two kids at a casement window on the 2nd floor hauling kids up through it so they won't have to go in the door and run into the principal or other teachers, going through the halls. I'm not sure I can do this. You have to go head-first through a fairly small space, and I was never much for climbing. But the girl in front of me did it okay, very fast, so I figure if she can do it, I can. It's not all that high up, actually [it couldn't actually be a 2nd floor, but that's what the dream says it was) - I just clamber up on the stones of the wall and they grab me by the arms and I slide on through into the hallway. [The guy, on my right, reminds me of Brooks - roundish, medium-light brown hair, nice guy, fun-loving. The girl, on my left, is black, I think.] I'm right in front of my class now, and I can just slip in the back when the teacher's back is turned (it's a large room, with a lot of kids, and 2 doors, both of which are open), but I need to go to the bathroom first. This room is at the end of the hall, and the bathroom is just a few steps to the right, on the near side of the hall. I go on in. It's a large, open place, with stalls that just have partitions, not high walls. They're also not set in the usual straight rows; some face one way, some are perpendicular to that, and I go looking for the "right" stall. It seems I'm concerned about being seen, and I'm actually waiting for some other girls to leave. First, though, I'm looking in a mirror at my hair. There's a black girl in front of me and I'm sort of leaning around her. My hair is black, or very dark brown, and curly, very much like black women do their hair when they get it straightened and then "done" - that quality of stiffness in the curl, not bouncy and springy. It's a bit messed up from being outside - I fluff the top a bit and look at the back. The back is separating - there's a stray curl sort of stuck in limbo while some of the rest has gone straight. I don't have time to do much for it now. Also, I look down at my feet and legs - I'm not wearing white pants after all, they're black! Wonderful! My shoes are not too messy and there's only a few spots on my pants. I'm glad. Now, looking around for a stall, I wander to the right a bit and gradually realize I'm looking at the boys' section. This is a big bathroom, and the right half is the boys'. That's why it looks a bit different. I turn around; a couple of other girls leave (blondes, by the way), and I pick a stall. I'm at a sink first, though, and I'm interested in this little sponge dispenser on the right-hand side. It's a coin-op thing, I guess, though I don't see how much it is. But it seems to be saying you get 6. I don't know why you'd want 6 sponges at the same time - I also wonder if they come out dry and squashed like the French ones and then expand when they get wet. That would make them pretty portable, after all. (776 words)

I'm in a sort of hotel, in a room with My ex. We may actually live here, this is a bedroom, rather close, I'm not sure if there are any windows, but there are 2 beds (or one big one) and a low table with a lamp on it, it's lit and the rest of the room is in shadow - it's quite late at night and I've either already been asleep or I'm trying to get to sleep, and My ex is mad at me. He's really quite mad, and this is not unusual for him, but frankly I've had about enough of it. I get up and go out, taking my blanket with me - I'm gonna find someplace else to sleep. I go down through the hotel - the place is quite open, the room wasn't on an enclosed hallway, and there's like a gallery around a staircase, some lounge areas, an opening into maybe a restaurant or ballroom over there. I look into this side area that's got banquettes around part of it, I'm thinking I could curl up there and sleep, but everywhere seems to be occupied. This is a nice place, maybe not the very finest hotel, but pretty plush, and has flowered carpet everywhere and rose wallpaper. Looks a little Edwardian - dark wood railings and little round tables, Queen Anne chairs. Not overdone or overstuffed though. However, the place is quite busy tonight. Not crowded, but enough people about that I can't find anyplace to sleep. [Note that I consider it perfectly ok to be walking around dressed for bed, with a blanket bundled up in my arms, prepared to curl up in a chair for the night with hotel guests around.] Well, poop. I go on down to see Loretta. She's in a room/suite/apartment in another part of the hotel, a lower floor, maybe, or at least down a level. She's about to move out of this place, but I'm not sure if she's leaving the hotel or just going to a different part of it. She's happy to see me - as always. Loretta's one of my best friends, I can always count on her. (329 words)

I'm visiting a house somewhere, that belongs to a man, and there's some other people visiting him; it's a really nice visit. He lives by some water; a lake - I don't think it's the ocean, but it might be - in a sort of a lake-house, very large and comfortable - the sort of place that has a big window that looks out over the water, and I think he's just a friend - he's a middle-aged man, kind of a friend of the family, not a real close personal friend of mine, but he's somebody that we all like. We've gone to visit him and it's daylight - nice day - and we go outside, for a bit of a walk, to look around. Where he lives is nearby to some other houses, buildings, various kinds, a proper little wharf, even - and next door is this neat little house that is almost all glass, all the way around - it's got windows on all four sides, and you can see in, and there's furniture, and I know that somebody lives there, a man lives there - I'm looking at it, thinking how cute it is, even though I assume some awkwardness from living in such a place, where people can see inside all the time. It crosses my mind that people might break in, they can see what you've got and it's hard to do certain personal things, with people being able to see in the windows - but it sort of reminds me, in a remote way, of that dream Lori had with the glass room, and also reminds me a little of that sunken conversation pit at the apartment party room at Lynn and Dan's, that we had our party in, it was really a very comfortable, nice [area?] and this place has couches, lounge-y places in it. There is something in the middle of it - it's not just one open room - there's something in the way of wherever you are and the place you can see out, it's really nice. And while we're looking that direction, I see this man come walking up, into the room, from underneath it, somewhere. I had not realized that there was an underground to this house - and that is obviously where he does his private, personal stuff; I'm presuming the bathroom and the bedroom are down there, and there's a small staircase that leads up into this room, of course - and that's even cuter. The man comes up and into the room (I don't know precisely what happens next, what we do, but we do talk to this guy - I don't believe we go into this house - he must come outside and it's him as the image that I remember precisely about the dream. He's large, he's a burly, big man - you might think he was a logger, or a woodsman or something - he has very dark hair, a - not a big beard, but a very black, heavy beard, and mustache, and dark, bushy eyebrows - you know, that kind of person - he even has on your basic sort of woodsman outfit - flannel plaid shirt and all that - but he is not a rough man at all - he's very nice, but kind of - well, almost gruff, in manner, and he sort of glowers around - he's not actually angry at anything, it's just his manner.) And it does strike me that there is something about me or about us he disapproves of. I think it's mostly us. And the fact is that he is part of a group of people who live in this area - his house is next to some other houses that belong to these people - and they're kind of like Amish, only different - [I didn't give a name to them in the dream, they are not specifically Amish people, but they're a little like that] and there is at least one other person from this group visible in this scene. I don't think of her actually doing anything, but she's a lady, and is wearing your basic image of Amish or Mennonite lady's country-type clothes, and a cap - the kind of cap that's fitted at the back and has straps, and what's funny about that is that as soon as I notice her cap I realize he's got one on too, and I find that a little strange, but I realize that it must just be one of the things that they do, this group of people.

At a movie with Chris - indoor theater, lot of kids around - there's the arcade-sort-of-things out in the lobby area (to the left of the theater proper, though, not before it, the way a theater usually is - this arrangement has been in another dream). It's a horror movie, but frankly it's pretty poor, and I am just not interested, and I leave. Somehow I get hooked up with a group of old folks on a tour bus - I think Chris and I were on this tour, but I'm not at all sure what the sequence of events is here - and all I know is the movement from the theater to a kind of roadhouse. There's a place where the bus stops, anyway, and we get off the bus and something happens. The bus leaves without me, if memory serves (I'm not sure that's right), but I don't mind - I don't mind any of this, as a matter of fact - I'm a little bit concerned because I haven't gotten in touch with Chris and here I am far away, and I don't quite know where I'm going, but I'm not worried about it. Next, I've come to a large house of a fairly large, wealthy family [I don't know how I got here, that is, consciously - in the dream it was part of the sequence of events; either I got there on the tour bus or some bus, or I got there naturally, another way] - several brothers and sisters, very nice people, and somehow I get to be acquainted with them. This is sort of out of the ordinary, but I do - there's a younger daughter who's real nice, and we get along very well - she shows me the house - particularly I've noticed a kind of sitting room/family room, with windows on the street, and there's games and things around, craft projects and things, this is where they spend a lot of their time, just in recreation, and it's not like a room with a lot of equipment in it for recreation - this is where they come to be together and just - you know, play. And there's, like jigsaw puzzles, I think - games that you put on a table. Maybe somebody's working with clay, I don't know. But it's a really very close, comfortable, friendly atmosphere, and I get to know one of the younger sons - I don't know how much younger he is and I don't think of him as a boy and me as older than him, so either I am his age (or younger) or he is my age - just the same, he's a nice, unmarried, younger son, and he falls in love with me, and buys me a Corvette. The whole production is rather neat, he has his assistant, or footman, or somebody - servant - butler - along with him, and he makes this announcement that I should come and see something, he has something for me, I think, is how he puts it, and I'm very apprehensive about this, I don't want him to have bought me something extravagant, by any means, and he drops these hints and says it's outside, and I'm suddenly figuring it's a car. "Uh-oh, what has he done?" And he even drops these hints about the color, and I'm saying, "As long as it's not [I think I may have said] orange", and it turns out that the thing is in fact half orange, it's red and orange, painted all these very fast colors, you know, with very shiny chrome, but the front part is red and the back part is orange, or the underneath part is orange and the top is red, something like that. And it is a hot car, any way you look at it, and it's in a crate - a funny kind of a crate, it doesn't exactly cover the whole car, it's kind of like you packed a car in molded plastic, and partly crated some of it, it's funny. Anyway, he shows this to me, and I'm very excited, and very pleased. Actually, I'm quite willing to have it. Part of me thinks that I ought to turn it down, and some of me also thinks that I ought to not keep it, I ought to sell it and take the cash, because that is what I normally say that I want to do with such things - I always say that "if I ever won a contest or something..." But this is a gift from him, for one thing, and it is really a neat car, too! A Corvette! for me! And of course I'm very surprised that he wants to do this, and I tell myself, "Well yes, he can, so why not?" and I'm very grateful to him. He is a very nice guy, and I think I may very well marry him, I don't know. (786 words)

I'm at the Center, and at the office at the same time, it seems. Bonnie is here, she's kind of in charge; there was a time when she got mixed up with Sue, but I'm not sure at all where Sue is. The office is a lot like our own, and - at least Bonnie's desk looks a lot like hers, in an alcove, and there are some desks down the middle, kinda like we have 'em now, and there are a few people there doing some phoning or something. Bonnie is doing something with some money, and there's something about Lori in this. Maybe somebody's trying to get in touch with her, I don't know - that's not at all clear, but I'm looking through some pictures in an album, and I was wanting to describe Lori to somebody, and in the pictures of her in this album that I find, her hair is two radically different ways, and both of them are different from the way she normally wears it, which I think is startling - one of them is particularly unattractive, with heavy bangs and kind of longish in the back to a flip, as it were - it really does not look good on her at all. At some point Bonnie goes somewhere and I've got to leave some money on the desk, and I didn't want to just set it in the middle - I looked around for the safest place to put it. I ended up just sort of putting it up towards the wall and putting something over it. Then the office sort of transforms into the library proper - I don't think there was an actual [dream] change. It might have been that way all along, but the fact is that they're wanting to change the furniture in our office and we need to get up and let the people who are moving the furniture around do this. There are a lot of people about - it's a busy sort of day, but it's not a normal day - maybe we're closed to the public or something, I'm not sure - but there is something about us not being dressed up for a normal workday, or prepared to do our normal work. There's somebody I'm looking for. Millie's here, I'm pretty sure; I'm not identifying anyone else except Bonnie, she's around somewhere, and Ted; and we go out of the office for a while. I'm not conscious of what we do, out, but when we come back, not only have they taken all of our office landscaping out, for the moment, but they've brought in all these fancy, shiny, well-taken-care-of antiques - they're really gorgeous pieces of furniture. A lot of them not office furniture by any means - like a dining table and chairs, there's a credenza, a drawer-thing (I'm thinking there are dressers) - they're walnut, maybe, or mahogany - dark, anyhow. They have been somewhere else, maybe in storage or some such place. I think it's in a place where they had been in use, but they needed to be moved out of there, and the only place to put them is in our office (or at least the only place where someone decided to put them was in our office). We don't need the things, and they are radically changing the look of the office, and I don't know how they're gonna get our desks and things back in there, but what they're doing is setting these things up in a sort of a room-arrangement, and their plan is to put our office landscaping back in with 'em. This is gonna be kind of fun for us, because it'll make things a lot more attractive and niced-up, and I can see where with this dining table and chairs, we can actually sit down and have meals, which is a very strange concept, but, well, it is for the moment kind of a nuisance, especially disrupting the work for a whole day by taking up all the time moving furniture. The next room (I'm not sure if that's part of our office or not) is also being temporarily occupied - by the Library Bookstore, apparently - and they have shoved all these shelves in there, and all these volunteers (you know, the stranger types?) wearing the aprons, who think that they know everything that's going on, and they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing - but what they don't know is, the people who occupy the room don't know what they're doing there and there's a conflict of interest going on. Just the same, there's nothing better to do than wander around and look at the books. And a lot of the other staff, from other places, are doing that, we're pretty much together. I don't know why we're being allowed to browse around and look at these books - I guess that they're going to actually be selling from this point (although it doesn't seem like a place to do that) and they've allowed the staff to come in and have a look even as these volunteers are filling up the bookshelves. The light in this room is yellow, rather on the dim side; the office light is very shaded - there's no direct sources of light on. Matter of fact, it's dim enough I should think they would have wanted to turn a light on to work in, by this time. But there's not just a door-size opening, it's at least a double-door-size opening that leads into the book area, that you can see this yellow light through. A lot of people are milling about and they're about to get finished setting up the antique furniture - all these wonderful Queen Anne legs, fancy drawer pulls, neat stuff, it really is. I don't know where it came from - we certainly have nothing like that in the "real" world. (993 words)

I'm with a nice young man that I've just met, and he's walking me back to school/the library/home? (I work there, and the rest of the people there are familiar library people, but it looks like an old school, very well-used, with glass windows in the doors, long tiled hallways, lockers and that.) He's being very nice to me and we've been having a nice time. He's tallish and blonde, with shortish, trim hair - I think he's wearing a suit, too. [I forget where we've been, but] he's being very nice to walk me back here - we're going through a nice old neighborhood, with cute little houses and lawns, quiet, nice little families live here. Now that we're about to part company, he's asking if he can see me again, and I'm a little shy, but I say yes. Golly, he's actually asked me for a date! I have a date with this guy! I'm befuddled and elated at the same time. Ooh. So, I go on in the building, and I'm in the hallway where we have our lockers, and I'm supposed to be putting something away for a group of us (teachers? library staff?) - some money or something, we always keep it in locker #5. The lockers are small ones, set in an alcove of sorts in the middle of the hall, rather like post office boxes, only larger, and they can be moved. And it seems that locker #5 has indeed been moved; there's some boys who were supposed to be moving some lockers, but I didn't think they meant to move this one, and they must have been early anyway. Wayne is here, he's quite anxious that these things should be put away, and I'm saying, "But I don't see #5 - where is locker #5? did they move it? why would it be moved?" (306 words)

I'm in London, out looking for the place where a friend lives - I've been staying with another friend and she's gotten a map for me over the telephone. I've come most of the way, but now I'm not sure where the turn-off is. I'm on a small, slow motorbike or Moped and it's really pretty tedious, but at least it's better than walking. But I feel kind of silly, perched up here. This street is quite long and straight, out in the suburbs, and the one I want to turn on is at right angles to it - it's quite open here, slightly rolling land, small houses and some open space between streets and the streets are wide. I make the turn but I'm not utterly positive it's the right one, and go some ways down. I get some way and decide this must not be the right street - so I turn around and go back up - it is uphill, and it takes a while. Part way back, something occurs to me, that maybe this is the right street after all, so I'll go back. But rather than turning around again (which is rather troublesome - this thing doesn't steer well), I decide to coast backwards downhill. In the rearview mirror, I see a truck coming across a vacant lot at right-angles to the street, and the lot is full of high grass and the ground is certainly not even. It's coming at a pretty fair clip and dives over a deep drop-off, sending it nose-first into the ground, and it flips over, curling up just like a truck wouldn't and back out again as it hit the ground on its back. I'm going down past it and wonder if I should go to help, but I figure people will be coming out soon anyway. As I coast down, a boy on a (bike? skateboard? something else?) is coming up the street, towards the left side, and I'm more or less on the right, but I'm finding it hard to steer and I keep veering left. As it is, I'm thinking that I'm correcting for it and I'm still veering, and he's moving left to get out of my way, and thinking surely I'll be steering to miss him, and we almost crash. I'm quite relieved that we don't, and stop a bit further down. All this has rather been enough for me, and I'm going to give the whole thing up and go home. So I ride back up the street to the one I turned off of, and look around for a telephone, thinking I'll let people know what I'm doing. [I'm not clear on whether I meant to call the person I was staying with or the person I was going to visit.] I'm no longer outdoors, now, this is a large apartment building and there's a door ajar right across from me, so I look inside. It's a sort of storeroom, no telephone, but there's another door on the left wall and a voice calls out "What do you want?" in a gruff English accent. I say I'm looking for a phone, do you know of one in this building, and realize from the sound that he's on the toilet. No wonder he's annoyed. He comes out quickly, fastening his trousers - looks like your olde-English gardener or villager, white hair and beard, hat, scarf, boots. Says there's not a public phone, I'll have to go outside.

With a group, friends, on motorcycles - in a neighborhood, we've stopped. Getting ready to leave again, I'm going to ride the motorcycle myself (I haven't before) - it's one of those strange ones with a long front, I'm not sure I can handle it but I think so. We're like in somebody's back yard, it's got muddy patches and a few trees (rather scruffy place) - I get it stuck in the mud - first the front end, and I get it out, then the whole back end. It's very easy to pull out, as if it doesn't weigh anything, but I feel stupid and clumsy. I try to pretend it's ok. There's a place where we go into a small office building and get into an elevator that takes us up to another outside - when you get out, it's like a parking lot next to a marina (on the small side - basically I just see a red and white striped canopy, cars, some fences, the ground isn't level, it goes downhill like it does at a marina - I don't actually see any water). I'm at this place more than once. Last time, I'm with a little old woman - maybe she's even in a wheelchair - she's grumpy and crabs a lot, and when we get on the elevator I keep saying, "Do you want me to push Express?" but she won't listen. I guess that means the elevator has an Express function that lets you go from bottom to top without stopping - but since we do that anyway before she ever pays attention and answers me, it's ok anyhow. So remarks a man who's on the elevator with us. There are quite a few people here. I didn't want her to be making a scene, but nobody seems to mind. Michael J. Fox is my boyfriend and there's a scene somewhere, where we're french-kissing - I'm really sucking on his tongue and one of us is suggesting something, but I don't remember who or what. Blonde teenage girl - just met - went somewhere with - she's got to go - home, maybe - green grassy hill, near water I think, lots of trees - man (David Ogden Stiers?) with hatchet, I'm very nervous, want him to put it down but he wants to show me something, all very innocent but I don't trust him - I'm in car, he's outside - I try to get hold of the hatchet.

I'm in a big building, a school, library, or something else, don't know - maybe mixed up with a resort? There's a group of us girls, we've been doing something; whether it was work or not, we're having fun, and we're on a rest break, heading for the bathrooms. There are guys around, too, and their bathroom is next to ours, I can see the door at a right angle to the women's. Where we are, on our way there, is away from the main area, where we'd been doing whatever it was - it's inside but very large and open, high ceiling, maybe like a convention hall. The color is all, maybe, peach? Goldish? Sand-y? There's no furniture or anything but panels, or something in high stacks at least, that make it necessary to go through from where we came here, to the bathrooms. Now, I don't know why, but I've stopped to use some mouthwash. I have my mouth all full of it when I see that there's a boy here, with a companion - girlfriend? aunt? - and he looks familiar. I think of Billy , and there's that sudden flash of silly thoughts - "How could it be Billy? He's dead!" - "How can he look so much like Billy? But he's too young" - "Something's wrong, he doesn't look quite like Billy" - et cetera. But I hear some other girls talking to him and understand what's going on - this is actually Billy's son, and he's come to collect some things of his father's. We didn't exactly realize that he had a son, one of those peripheral things you don't really grasp about people. The other girls are talking to him, saying sympathetic things, and I want to but my mouth is full of mouthwash. I make a gesture or two and point to my mouth, take his hand (or something in the way of touch), and smile at him. He's just finished up anyway and he's leaving. I feel a little stupid, but there's nowhere here I can spit the stuff out. Now I'm gonna go on into the bathroom and find a sink. I go through the door, it's in a dark sort of alcove, and on the other side is a surprise. For one thing, the lights aren't on, there's dim daylight coming through the windows - either frosted glass or they have curtains on. But it's not just a bathroom, it's a lounge, and it has showers (all the fixtures and decor harks back to maybe the Forties, at least the Fifties, maybe earlier, hard to say - but everything's in pristine condition) and chairs and now I'm turning a corner and here's a bed - with someone sleeping in it. Everything looks very comfortable, peaceful, quiet - I realize they've really set this place up for us to relax in. I keep going and find another bedroom, differently decorated, rather flouncy and fluffy - someone's in this bed, too. I wonder how far this goes - maybe I'll find an empty bed and go to sleep myself.

I'm part of a space mission - we're military, I guess, because we have a captain and officers and uniforms - and we're on some planet in a hostile situation. There's this group of people in charge, they're like a religious sect. A group of them wear priests' robes rather like Tibetan monks and they're sort of "enforcers". There's also a high-priestess-type, young and beautiful, dark blonde, wears a sarong, maybe there's a high priest, too - there's a pretty fair number of 'em and they keep the people under their thumbs. They have a crystal that gives them power - you hold it up opposite something and it generates this powerful beam that does something, I'm not sure what - maybe it can blow things up. Anyhow, they sure don't like us and we're trying to get away from them and keep from getting killed - also in the meantime to help the people they're oppressing. Right now we've escaped their clutches and we're running through this place that may be underground or in an enclosed city - it's dark (rather like a warehouse, dim lights) except for where there are rooms with people in them. I'm about to get separated from my group and have to get in somewhere - I dash in a door and down some narrow spiral steps. There's a young boy here, maybe 13 - I grab him by the collar (perhaps metaphorically?) and tell him they're coming, he has to help me - he shows me another way out. We all meet up again shortly and head for the outside. There's a big chase across some open terrain; we're firing at each other and ducking and going around things (very typical movie SF stuff), but then suddenly we get caught. We sort of run smack into some more of them and we're stopped in our tracks. We know when we're beaten - there's no way we can fight this many if 'em - there's only about 6 or 8 of us. They take us the short distance to where they're all gathered and they're all turned to look at us - there are various ranks of them; the "priests" are sitting back-to-back along a stone or concrete block - others are arranged in some rows, rather like an audience facing away from us, toward a sort of altar - really just an arrangement of stones, and the crystal is up there somewhere. (I can't say if it's just on one of the stones, or being held by someone.) I can see it. The high priestess, turned toward us in the front row of this "audience", is making dire pronouncements about what's going to happen to us. Suddenly, the priests and some others start coughing and choking and holding their throats, eyes rolling up (your typical reaction to poison in the movies) and then keeling over. All the others look amazed and/or horrified, and we seize the moment. (Actually this is the result of something we tried earlier, not precisely poison but something to thwart the priests, to interfere with their systems - we put in the water, maybe, I don't remember - and we were disappointed that it hadn't worked. That was one of the reasons we had to escape. Apparently it just had a delayed reaction, and now it's killing them off, at this wonderfully dramatic moment.) We leap into action, while they're all goggling at the priests - the others don't have weapons, or any other power to stop us, except with the crystal. The captain and the other guys go for the guns they took from us; I make a dive for the crystal. This upsets the high priestess, but I stand on the stone and hold it up the way I saw her do. I have it in my right hand, trying to hold it straight up and keep my fingers off the front of it. I'm having a little trouble holding it - it's not oily but it keeps slipping down. I'm really terrified of dropping it. It appears they can't get it away from me while I hold it like this, but if I drop it they'll get it - and I certainly don't want it to be damaged. Finally I get a good grip on it, and focus it forward and down, aiming it at something (I don't know what it is - a sort of mirror? A round thing, maybe brass - down where the high priestess is). Something starts to happen. I can feel vibration, then energy flowing through my body up to my hand - then the crystal glows and shoots out a bright, wide beam of light down to the mirror-thing, where it makes a big bright glow. Everybody's marvelling at it - they're surprised that I can do it. The high priestess is watching carefully in case it screws up. Where the glow is, a picture starts to form, an oval shape as though it were in a frame of light. I see myself, like a film, looking at someone and listening (by the way, "I" am a beautiful, slim blonde with long hair) - then (my image) I react in surprise and joy, and say, "A captain? Really I'm going to be a captain? Oh, thank you sir! Thank you!" And I realize the crystal is showing me the future - that sometime I'm going to be promoted, and I'm thrilled. Everybody else is pleased, too, even the high priestess, who smiles at me as if I were an innocent young thing who's just learned how to do something for the first time. There are nods and smiles all around and everybody's happy. I guess we've actually liberated the captors too. (961 words)

I'm in a smallish, slightly crowded room - I think it's a living room, don't know whose. I'm with 2 others, an old woman and a girl younger than me. The room has lamps on, it must be night - the drapes are closed. We're engaged in some project, I can't say it's actually LT processing, but before we can get rolling, the old woman gets very deep into grief for her late husband. He was in the Navy, or went to sea for some reason, and was lost at sea. She hasn't cried about it in a long time. Actually she has trouble showing her feelings, and it's difficult for her to really let go and just cry. She reminds me of Nina from Park Forest, and also Martha, who covers everything up with a joke or a "pleasant" attitude - always be polite, never offend anybody, or disturb them. We're encouraging her, though this isn't what we planned to do, and of course she's letting her trained behavior override her feelings mostly - she keeps apologizing and getting out of her body. I have her bend over from the waist and I'm rubbing the small of her back to help her release. I don't feel any special warmth toward her, I just want her to get on with her work. I don't like people behaving this way. (229 words)

I'm in high school, first day I think, and we're getting our schedules and finding things, getting organized. I'm with a girlfriend or 2, and maybe a boy. The halls are crowded, kids moving all over the place. We find our lockers on the first floor, near the entrance. There's an open space here, it's all tiled. My locker is in a corner next to a wall, the upper one (these are half-lockers). I put something on a shelf, just one thing. I don't want to leave much in there yet because we don't have our locks. There's a group of boys, slightly tough-looking, nearby, and they're making some snide audible remarks about us (or one of us? or just me?). The boy with us says to ignore them. We consult our schedules - among other things, I'm taking algebra. The others go off ahead of me to class, and I stay behind for a minute, then follow. I go around the corner into the main front hall [arranged something like Kimball] where I can see the daylight coming through the open front door, and start for the stairs. Just then I realize (from the feel) that I'm not wearing any underpants. Oops! I dash back around to my locker (I don't remember putting them in there) and grab them, then go back, thinking I'll get an opportunity to jam them back on, on the way to class. (234 words)

I'm off on a weekend with some people, we've been having an event, sort of like the SCA having a tournament, lots of fun - we've had to bring a lot of things to set up (in that way it's more like LT), and this woman is driving some of us back to town in her very large car. We've been out in the country, it's beautiful, all green trees, flowers, sunshine, wonderful. We had a good time. The woman is older than we are, rather sophisticated, good-looking and well-dressed; she's new to all this and in a way, since she's older (we're still kids, really) she's - not precisely a mother-figure but maybe a sort of mentor. We like her. The others and I go through some of the stuff we've brought back so that they can take theirs when they're dropped off. I'm thinking about some peacock feathers and some blue artificial flowers that I brought - we've used these so many times now, they're getting to be a fixture - we really ought to find something else next time. Well, they get dropped off, and it's just me and the woman. For a bit I go all the way to the back of this very long car, to see what it's like to ride back there. The car now has an aisle down the center. We're coming back into town now, onto my street, which is lined with old apartment houses and occasional business buildings - lots of green trees, very Austin, comfortable neighborhood, everything all integrated. We pass by a new Supermarket I didn't know was there. Very nice, that'll be great, I've been going to the Kroger a few doors away (and only a few doors from me) and I prefer Supermarket. Both of these stores are, like I said, integrated with the neighborhood. They're almost on the street, no big parking lots, narrow side to the street, a simple neon name sign each, very unobtrusive. Anyway (I'm coming back up to the front of the car) a few doors down is my place, a nice old frame building with a side driveway (the sort with two paved strips) and a porch and there are people outside doing things, like the old guy on the porch next door. I like it here. (387 words)

I live in a little house on a suburban street with my family - I've got at least one brother, and Phylicia Rashad (from the Cosby Show) seems to be our mother. It's a very cold winter morning, and there's been a freeze overnight. I go outside to see how things are and I discover the driveway, which slants downward a little to the street, is frozen solid. A smooth, slick sheet of ice. I kneel down by it and give it a rap - it cracks a bit, underneath. Looking around, I can see the ice on everything - no cars are moving on our street but it's still very early. Farther, where I can see the bigger cross-streets and bits of main road, there are cars moving, and pretty normally. I go back inside and tell "Mom" that we can't get out of our driveway, at least I'm not going to try to drive on it. (I don't come in the front door - I go around to the back and come in through a sort of side room to the kitchen - maybe it's a laundry or storage room, there are a lot of things stacked around, probably some gardening equipment, outside things. The lights aren't on. I scrape my boots before coming into the kitchen.) I'm pretty sure "Mom" means to go to work anyway, that she expects us to keep on getting ready to go.

I'm in India, on an extended visit with some other people. We seem to be doing business. We have quarters and an office in a sort of self-contained bazaar or arcade, all indoors. [You could think of it as a crude Apparel Mart.] I am about to have a class in some physical discipline with a very distinguished teacher - it's not yoga or karate, but it has elements of both yoga and martial arts. I'm arriving at the "gym" - they wouldn't call it that, but this room is for this kind of stuff and it does have some fixtures like bars installed. I'm wearing a dress and daytime gear, and my big black wool cloak with the pointed hood with a tassel. [My real one has a round hood, no tassel.] The teacher is there wearing draped robes, he's on the small side and looks like you might picture such a person who's a master of an Oriental discipline - serene, calm, still, inscrutable, eyes that you know are watching your every move - wiry, looks slight but can move like a cat and real strong. He has a couple of guys with him, much larger - I'm thinking of them as his bodyguards, but they're probably not - just his entourage, I guess. Anyway, I bow and say hello to him and get ready to change clothes. Not wanting to waste any time, I've taken off my cloak and draped it over this structure (It's part of the "gym" equipment but I don't know exactly what it is), and I take off my shoes and a couple other things when I realize I'm not wearing any underpants. I'm shocked. I'll be putting on shorts and a T-shirt [the same navy and red I wore yesterday] and I can't not have underpants on. I hesitate for a minute, then say "I'll be back in a minute" and run out. Around a corner is our "shop" - Bonnie is there, sitting behind the counter/window, adding up figures, I think, and I say, "Where's the key to the house? I need to get in, quick." She doesn't respond. Or, rather, she says, "Just a********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************ht add, there must be a large community of them here - they're not permanent residents, I know that, but on long visits, perhaps with businessman husbands. Most of these women look like typical suburban mall shoppers; various ages.) They're all grabbing things off long racks, holding them up and saying what-do-you-think? to their friends, then dashing off to dressing rooms. Someone even tosses something at me, saying, "Isn't this great? It would look good on you!" It's a sort of straight dress, white with polka-dots or a similar pattern in navy, with wide straps squared onto the top. Frankly I can't see it on me, but maybe she's right... I toss it over my shoulder and think about looking for a dressing room, poke my head into a workroom and realize it's too much of a hassle, and it's already half an hour past the time for my lesson. I toss the dress somewhere and get back to the "gym". [I had grabbed my cloak back and put it on when I left.] I'm standing there in my cloak, apologizing to the teacher and saying I can't do it today and I hope I can have another appointment, and am very curious to find I've got my shorts and T-shirt on now. I don't remember changing, I didn't have time. Still don't have underpants on, though. I realize this all looks very peculiar, but I just don't see how I can do this class without underpants. [I am, by the way, worried that the teacher may not let me have another class.] (570 words)

I'm leaving work - going to be picked up by a boyfriend, who will go with me somewhere, where we'll be wearing VKian costumes. I've got on this rather nice outfit and I'm really looking forward to seeing him in his - he's good-looking, and I'm really fond of him. I work downtown and the office is in a building, upstairs, and I can't say it's the library, but I've just realized that I've left my keys there, and some other things as well, that I ought to have, and now I can't get back in since I've left my keys. I've gone down a side street - it would be near the library, at least, might be Field - so I turn right, I'm going there anyway and I keep looking out for this boyfriend, he should be along pretty soon. There's a truck of some kind there, maybe a large van, a bus, something like that, the kind of vehicle that you have to sort of climb up into. I'm up in there [I'm not sure why - maybe to wait], looking at something [that's kinda like the dashboard, although I can't say that that's what it is], and I rearrange something on it - I also am wondering if I shouldn't just go in what I've got on - somehow (this outfit) doesn't seem complete to me anymore.

I'm at Warrior - it is dinnertime, and I've been staying in this other room, finishing something - we were all sitting in our chairs, and something was happening at the very end that I didn't finish. So instead of staying to finish that, I'm now coming into the room where everything is out on the tables - it's a long table with picnic-sort-of benches along it. There's a number of us (certainly not as many as there were at Warrior last year), and everyone else has been eating for a while. I'm rather concerned about getting enough to eat. I go around the table with this dish that I have [picked up or been handed, I don't know which] - everybody was taking something with them that they'd been handed by the cook or somebody. This was vegetable-puff things, or little bitty things that look "grassy" - definitely an attractive arrangement on the oblong dish, but it looked like sort of tufts of grass, which was not particularly appealing. I take it around the table with me, glancing at the other dishes as I go and think there's not much left, put my dish down and I'm talking to someone down at the end there - we get involved in talking about something and it's still a little while before I get to put anything on my plate. I go down to the other end of the table and pick up a dish or 2, sort of scrape what's left on it together and get some meal-for-me. Most everyone else has already left, it's just me and a few other people. Now we're going into another room, with Brad, and I am feeling very guilty, apprehensive, that Brad is going to find me out. He will know that I haven't managed my time very well and this is the result of it: I have not gotten myself fed because of my own indulgences. I'm very concerned about that. He's talking. There's a clump of us at one end of the room and it's almost as though we're lying down; not quite. Jenny's right next to me, and Brad is talking about something, and his voice fades out, a little now and then - I'm almost ready to say, "I can't hear", but I hesitate. Then I hear Jenny say - and not very loud or strong either - "John, I can't hear", and I repeat, almost with her, "John, I can't hear you", which, as soon as I say it I realize isn't quite the way we're "sposed to say it" - I should say, (firmly) "John, I can't hear!" and stick my hand up, very clearly. I also realize right after that it's not John, it's Brad - and we both said John. An interesting situation, I don't know quite what to make of that, but Brad doesn't say anything about it (at least not before I'm out of that scene). (484 words)

I'm at Susan house - she lives in this house with her parents, and I'm with someone else, someone bigger than I am - can't say male or female, known or unknown, older or not - all I know is bigger than me. We are engaged in something that Susan knows about and is part of, but this particular exercise she isn't taking part in and is in the house asleep. So are her parents. She wouldn't mind if she knew we were out here in the middle of the night; just the same we don't want to wake her up. We're out on the lawn at the left-hand front corner of her house. There's a tree or 2 in the yard, lots of green grass, sturdy green grass. I'm wanting to turn the water on, and for some other reason I have to go inside of the house. To do this I go out and around to a side door of some sort (that part is not entirely visible). I go from the outside to the inside bathroom. I'm moving very carefully through the house - we both are, at first, but the other person goes off and does something else. I go into a bathroom to do something there. It's necessary for what's going on outside for me to be doing something in here. I get into this bathroom and I do turn a light on, not a very bright one - there's something like a clothes hamper that I have to kneel down by. I want to get something out of the door, and when I do - I'm trying to pull something out of this cabinet - I'm hearing a funny noise; kind of a growly noise, and I think I'm making this noise with whatever it is I'm doing. After it happens 2 or 3 times, I have a look in there, and discover a cat! It is the family cat, I know this cat, kind of, not real well, but still - he's curled up in there and I guess he's doing whatever cats wanta do in cabinets, and whenever I'm trying to pull on the thing he's making this kind of perfunctory growl at me. Not mad or anything, he's not going to attack, but I think that's kind of cute. (388 words)

I live in an apartment building - kind of one, I'm not real sure what it is - very open, has an open walkway with a railing, in front of the door that I've come in and out of. I'm not sure if I live alone or with some other people, but there's others around, they're all my age - once again I'm younger (or seem to be younger) than I am - I'm thinking of all these people in their twenties, a lot of camaraderie, lot of "youthful" palling-around is going on around here. I'm waiting for an old friend to come visit me - it's your typical week (or weekend) visit, and I'm getting ready for that. There has been a big mess made outside somewhere, for some reason. It involves tape - stuck to the railings of this outside bridgework, and it's the "guys" who have put it there - I go along and take it off, kind of when they're not looking. They were going to do it anyway, but I decided I'd just go ahead and do it. Then my friend arrives. Turns out she's a girl, and I do not know her in waking life - she's nobody in particular - and I also don't feel very close to her. Like I say, she's an old friend, I haven't seen her in a long time. This is not your warmest possible greeting. We're just curious to see how things are gonna go. I introduce her around. (252 words)

I'm at a LT event - probably WOW - a resort, somewhere a place out in the woods, anyway. I've been in a room with some old people and we've gone down to a room where another thing is going on (this is very disjointed). Not everybody who's attending is in this room - this is not a set part of the program, precisely; it's not like anything we normally do. There is someone leading; it's night, probably quite late, and there may be 30 or 50 people in here (I'm not sure - maybe not that many, but there's a lot). Something is finished, which is the reason that not everybody is together, and the guy who's leading decides to try something - it's a kind of meditation, we're going to lie down on these benches that are here, and do something; I did not quite get that at first and so I'm standing up, doing something, talking to somebody, for a bit while everybody else is rearranging themselves. Then when I see that they're all lying down, it turns out that there isn't room for me on any of the benches that are here. I go into another room to find something. I kinda thought there was a bench of this sort in the room I just came from. We go down there and somebody's there - it's not precisely a bedroom, but there is a bed in here, and somebody is there talking on the phone, I think - I look around, look beside the bed and the wall and don't find the bench that I thought was there - I think somebody's already thought to get it and take it down there. Come back down the hall, and I go into the room that's opposite the one where everybody else is, and poke around there. There's a number of kinds of things in here, and one of them looks as though, if you folded it right, it might be a bench that you could lie on. It's kind of like water skis or something - it's definitely sports equipment. The pieces are narrow, long, have markings on them like sports equipment does, stripes, numbers, etc. They're attached end to end and there's some hinges, like you could fold the things some way or other. I fool with it for a bit and get it to stand up, the way a bench would, and discover that the hinges are the wrong way to do this - or at least I haven't figured out how it is - so it won't stand up if you were to try to lie on it. I go back into the other room, then, to see what I can do - maybe just lie down on the floor. (466 words)

I've come into a bedroom, where there's mainly a double bed and a TV - there are windows, it's bright daylight coming through filmy curtains. There's somebody in/on the bed, I think male, young, he's just watching TV game shows. I get on the bed and join him. (48 words)

I'm on an almost-empty street in a small town. There are shops, etc., and street lamps. I'm walking down the street, about to turn a corner, and I'm confronted by a loud man in a raincoat - he's really mad about something but I don't know what. He just stands and yells at me, sometimes shoving with his elbow and shoulder - he's got his hands stuck in his pockets. I retreat up the street a bit - there are some people out watching. I guess they think I had something to do with this guy. He follows and keeps yelling at me - some of the time he yells around in general but it's mostly at me - I don't know him and definitely didn't do anything to start this, it seems he's just picked me because I'm handy.

I'm still in bed, just normal, trying to sleep - I get up, I guess I'm going to the kitchen or I'm checking on the cats, did I hear a noise? I see through the bedroom door that something is very, very wrong - the left hand wall (with an incorrect door in it) is lying on the floor, part of it anyway, and there's daylight coming through. I know that Julia planned to have some work done on the place, but I certainly didn't think it meant taking the walls off. This is terrible - I wonder if the workmen have done this by mistake, or is it really necessary? I can't see any way it would be. It's awful, it's dangerous, the cats could jump out or fall out the hole - I'm quite nervous about that, and I make sure they're in the bedroom so I can shut the door, but that's not great, there's no air conditioning in there. I go toward the bathroom - I'm planning on getting dressed and going to find Julia or call her and find out what's going on here - and suddenly the bathroom wall falls out. There's a couple of guys out there that I see through the hole, I suppose they're on ladders - they're wearing khaki uniform shirts and look like nice clean guys. I'm just standing there horrified. I've got to go out and do something about this. I pull on some pants and go out the front door. There's a concrete landing and stairs outside the door (which is on the south wall) that lead forward rather than backward. They're still working away at something out here, but I don't know what.

I am with a bunch of people who are friends or family, somewhere out at the edge of town or perhaps in the country. Across the road are fields - someone's working over there. Where I am is a kind of courtyard, it's largish and open - one side has an eave or awning over a walkway. There's an opening into another part of whatever this building is (up at the inside corner of the walkway-covered side). We've been doing something that was tough and hot and tiring. Earlier the people across the road had turned on a giant fan, and we had all cheered and clapped and jumped up and down. (I don't remember what we were doing at that time.) Something is happening to shrink a dog that I am with - I'm with part of these people, and one of them is James Garner (but not quite), and something dramatic is happening. I'm very worried about this dog - his body's getting smaller and smaller. (It seems to me that his head is not.) I'm asking him to jump up, and he does that, and licks on my face, and I hold on to him real tight. This is overcoming something, but I'm not sure what - I'm relieved that he can do this, or will do this, and I've gotta do something for him really quick. (The James Garner character) is encouraging me and patting me on the back and giving me support. We go through that opening, back to the outdoors, with this group of people. Suddenly we hear a noise, thundering - we look around, and from the back part of this courtyard, through another opening to an outdoors area, there comes this stampede/chase - what I think is happening is horses are being chased by some predator or other and there is a horse in the lead, big brown horse, looks lovely, and I'm saying, "Run, fella! Run! Run!" But what comes behind him is in fact deer, like proper forest deer. I don't see any predators like wolves or anything. They are moving at a pretty fast clip. They go around the courtyard and toward the left side, not straight across, and around the semicircle before they run off out of sight and they kick up a little dust. The people across the street turn the fans on again, and this is some cause for cheering again. (I think I've still got this dog in my hands - he seems to be sitting in a bucket - the bottom part bucket and the top part head - he is getting smaller.) Now, for some reason, I run around to the far side. There are bushes and things in the middle of this courtyard, some of which have thorns (and I don't know what it is that I'm running for), but I fall down and slide under one of the thorn-bushes. Nobody has seen me do this because they've all gone back through to the inside. When I come to rest I realize that I've got a buttful of thorns from the branches and some in my face; they're stuck there pretty good, and if I move I make it worse, which is scary and painful. I call for help - I call "Please come help me" - and at first no one hears me, but I try to call louder. I think somebody sees me through the opening and they're going to come, but in the meantime a car pulls up from the road, a convertible - very fast-looking Corvette type, and 2 boys get out - not real young, they may be college students or slightly older, nice young men, both very good-looking, wearing short-sleeved shirts. They see what's happened to me and come to the rescue right away. I didn't have to ask them and they didn't have to look around - nobody had to call for them. They just literally saw what was going on and came to help me. They start working with the branches, getting the thorns off me so I can move, especially getting them off my face. The worst part about my face is that if I try to turn my head the pressure gets worse and it hurts, a whole lot, and I keep my eyes squeezed real tight so I won't see anything and try to move my head. They haven't doctored it up or anything yet, but they've got me out of the brambles and so I'm just laying there flat. (759 words)

Driving away from somewhere, on a side street - either I just got in the car and it won't go, or I've just driven around the block and it stopped. Can't get it to go, so I get out and start to walk back for help. A few steps away, I wonder if I've set the brake. I look back, and, sure enough, it's rolling. At first I think it'll only roll a little bit, but just as I start to go on, it picks up speed. I try running after it a few steps, but I'll never catch it and if I did I couldn't stop it. So now I need help even more. I suppose it'll roll down to the end of the street and bump into something and stop. Like the curb. I hope. A little way further along the sidewalk there's a big hole - actually it goes down and then up, the sidewalk continues on the other side several feet above me. It's not natural, this hole - it's something to do with construction. The dirt is all red and sandy or clay, relatively clean, and I've got to go past it. It's lumpy, craggy, so I can step and climb up, but it's also slightly treacherous. It could break off if I grab an insecure bit. I sure don't want to fall and hurt myself, and I wish I didn't have to do this - but there's no other way if I want to get help. I can do this. I'm strong enough, and it isn't so big or hard as all that. I remember the raft trip, walking on those rocks, doing whatever I could do at the time. So up I go, stepping here and grabbing on there. There's one particular place I think might break off if I grab it, but it doesn't. (312 words)

I'm staying in someone else's house in another town, I'm here with a group - it's probably LT. Alleycat is with me, and I'm rather worried about him climbing on things - right now he's walking on some built-in bookshelves. There are books and knickknacks on them, and while he's being quite genteel, you know how easily these things turn to messes. If I disturb him, he might make a sudden move and knock something off. There's nobody else here at the moment, and I want to go into the bathroom just off here and take a shower, but I wonder what to do about Alleycat. (106 words)

My apartment is part of a complex, and it has a side door from the bedroom that opens onto a wood walkway, and there are bridge walkways to other parts of the building. (Seems to be redwood - it's quite pretty, there are green trees and flowers, nice place.) Gail Bialas is showing me something she's quite pleased about, and we talk. I go back inside. I don't have any lights on, and it's a bit gloomy. [Something] warns me that something is wrong, and I quietly go through to the living room and find that the place has been broken into. Turning toward (where the kitchen usually is), I see two girls just coming out (of what must be a bedroom - ?) with handfuls of my stuff, mostly jewellery. They don't seem to be especially big or especially tough, and while they're not particularly intimidated they do drop the stuff when I say "Hey - that's mine - what are you doing here?" (Or words to that effect.) They leave, but still look very self-confident and insolent. They're both blonde, by the way, pretty but a little trashy, wearing black leather jackets and jeans. (Actually they remind me of Kelly Bundy.) Outside, I can see there's more of them - at the front door, my apartment is on ground level and there's no deck - what I see are little hills, sort of dunes, hardly any grass, a bit of road - like I lived out in the boonies. Actually there's a whole gang outside - motorcycle - and they're just hanging around out there, milling around, some of them watching me. I wonder what they're planning. I'm afraid to go out there. They'd probably beat me up. I expect I should call the police. (296 words)

I'm living in a very interesting apartment on top of a little building in the middle of town (probably a very small town) - it's got several rooms and was quite cheap for the space. Actually I'm living with somebody else, and also the other person's younger brother. I'm not sure who's temporary here - I think he's looking for a job and just staying for a while, but it might be me. I've only recently broken up with My ex, and I'm storing some of his stuff for him. [Actually, I don't see any actual evidence of anyone else in this place - all the furniture seems to be mine.] The others are gone off this morning, and I'm poking around, wearing a pink satiny nightgown and robe set, short - I'm a normal size - and I go from the back through to the living room. Has a lot of nice antique pieces, but doesn't look "done". Then I go back to this middle room where there's no furniture, but some extra plants that are just stored here. One of them is a kind of tree that's been growing a lot, and needs a new pot rather badly. It's been in a small black plastic one, and as I handle it, it falls out. I fiddle with it some to see how it'll stand up and what sort of pot it might need, and I think I'll go look round the corner. There's an alcove (this place is a lot like an attic) where some odds and ends are "stored" (they're just sitting out) that either I don't have a place for or they're My ex's. I haven't looked over here much lately, I've come to sort of turn a blind eye, and now that I'm looking, I'm surprised. There's a few bits of furniture and some ceramic urns and figurines, and also here's a stack of glasses, tumblers, rather fancy ones with a shaped bottom and gold/red trim. Then there's some others I see nearby, just as I'm thinking, "Gee, I could have used these at the Christmas party and wouldn't have to buy plastic ones at all" - I'd forgotten all about them. Most of this stuff I'd gotten at garage sales. I'm looking at a tall urn, narrow, white porcelain with flowers on, that might be good for the plant. I'm wondering if it's heavy enough not to be knocked over. I reach for its top and lift, not looking directly at it, and I'm surprised it's so light until I look and see it's a small urn I've got, it was inside the bigger one. I lift the bigger one and find it's quite heavy after all - good. On my way back to the other room I find a brochure lying on a couch that's on the opposite wall - it's for this auction or estate sale of My ex's other, larger, furniture, which is elsewhere. I sit down to look at it, but it's still too dark to read, so I stand up and switch on the overhead light. Just then, I hear something at the door. Someone's coming in, probably the younger brother - he's probably forgotten something. I have that traditional reaction of not wanting to be seen, so I decide to hide. I switch off the light again, gambling that he isn't far enough into the room to see it go off, then quickly step through into my bedroom. I pause, then decide to go all the way outside on the terrace/roof. (There's some plants and furniture out there, and also gravel rooftop. You can see the town around the building, a little urban setting - looks somewhat 50's - and if people on the street are looking up, they can see you.) I hide around the edge of the door, listening. There is some movement nearby, but it turns out to be Tree - he just comes out through the door, looking very elegant. He's just been in a TV commercial, advertising some recordings, I think - I remember some blurb written about him, in the papers or TV Guide, maybe, about how he's the "finest illustration of Bure, ('somebody', and 'somebody')" there's ever been, this is just great. I think it's very sweet and funny. My Tree, a TV star. Great. (703 words)

I've gone to a party at Lorren's house. Lori and Renee are there, but for the most part I don't know anybody. There's particularly a group of nice-looking young men, who are having a pretty good time but sticking together. Little by little people are going away, and I figure they must be leaving. Eventually I have no clothes on [though I don't know why I took them off, except I know I think it's the thing to do], and I wonder if somehow people don't want to be around me because of it. I decide I might as well leave - I know Lori and Renee are in another room watching TV, and I suppose I ought to say goodbye to somebody, so I go that way and find there's a lot more people in there than I thought. Maybe half the party's in there, just watching TV. I'm really at a loss now. I put my clothes back on and leave. (145 words)

I've come back into this house where someone I know lives and teaches dance [is she a personal friend? - don't know]. She's a little like Amanda, leaning toward the dotty side, older but won't act like an old woman. Her living room is smallish, a little dark with only a couple of table lamps lit (it's night-time) - flowered couch down the side, coffee table piled with books and notebooks. [Seems like this is a college town or neighborhood, and everybody is either attending or teaching or something. She's a regular fixture herself and has a kind of professor-status.] I've come in a bit late. The class she's been teaching is just leaving, they're milling a bit. The teacher's not visible, she's probably in another room. One kid (tall, reddish-blonde, swaggery) says she's through for the night, too late, or words to that effect, but I know she needs to see me (or vice versa? or mutual?), so I'm gonna stay. She'll be out. Meanwhile I pick up a book off the coffee table to look through. I thumb through it and light on a particular page. It's a kind of who's-who, and has little bios of people. This one is describing Alan Nagy and has a picture. At first I only glance over it idly, noting the expected, that he has a degree in psychology, went to such-&-such university. Then I look closer, because the picture doesn't seem to fit, and realize that he was actually only noted for psychology on the side. His main focus was art, and this picture shows a huge sculpture being lifted upright with scaffolding. It must be bronze - looks it - and the caption says it's eight feet tall. There are a couple of men in the picture. I expect one's Alan; I'd like to see it closer, I want to see what he used to look like, but I'd need a magnifying glass and more light. (290 words)

I'm in a sort of police station, I think - a very plain room with plain desks and chairs, gray colors - and a woman is interrogating us, or maybe only the man I'm with. I'm paired with him [for reasons unknown] and James Dennehy is paired with another woman. The man is rather short, middleaged, wearing a suit - I think the interrogation is about him, and his wife beating him or something. It's a pretty cut-and-dried business, and over soon. James and the woman leave first, then us. We don't go the same places, and on my way home I decide I should go check on him, so I go to his apartment, which faces out over the sea on a hill, with a lovely terrace down below the long row of doors. His is right above the terrace, but I'm not positive which one - they all look alike. I know exactly its angle from the terrace, though, because I've sat there. But the terrace is overgrown with some sort of vines or long stick-like plants that have grown up from below - how could this happen in only a few hours? They're about halfway up the steps and over the floor of the terrace. I start down the steps, thinking I can get by them, but then realize I can't. Hum. So I go back up and pick a likely door. It seems like a good choice, because as I stand in front of it, I see it's shorter than the other doors - I would actually have to duck to get in. Even the building is shorter than the apartment next to it. I knock on the door, and to my surprise, James answers, "Who is it?" He lives next door to the man, so it must be the next apartment I want. It turns out James has just now gone to bed after talking to the little man - he just left, seems to be all right. I say how sorry I am for disturbing him (he hasn't opened the door, we've been talking through it) and that he should go back to bed. I'm in a prison, visiting with another woman. We're in an open area where a couple of very wide corridors meet and a sort of terrace begins. It must be late afternoon, the light is getting dim and yellow-gray. We sit down on a couple of long park benches. (Seems like we read or study for a little while.) After a while the men (inmates) start coming, and they gather around to talk to us, and we talk to them. (We're here for some educational purpose, I'm not sure what - it's as if we're teaching them something, like sages or something.) They crowd us a bit, and a few of them hold out things they want us to take, and I'm saying, "Guys, you know I can't take this - you know better than that!" (Because of the rules.) Gradually they go again. I'm smoking a cigarette, and I've been flicking the ashes on the floor. I'd just done it automatically, and now I see that there are no other ashes or butts anywhere, except mine. I'm about to crush it out on the ground, but I'm feeling very self-conscious about being so messy, so unthinking. I could have found (asked for) an ashtray, after all. (564 words)

I'm on my way home - where I live now. I've been where I used to live, I think it's my family home and my mother or stepmother was there. I've been moved out for some while, but I'm finally moving out the last things. Right now I'm pulling a piano behind me. I don't have any other way of getting it home, so I've rigged a harness so I can pull it on its casters. It's not big, maybe it's a baby grand - black, curvy shape, definitely not an upright. Fairly easy to pull, but still quite a chore to get it all the way there. I have to pull it on the street, of course, and it's causing somewhat of a traffic problem. Especially, I have to go up some stairs, fairly steep and rather long. [Never mind that the cars couldn't go up steps - they're still there.] Part of me says I can't do this, but little by little up we go. It's hard but not as hard as I thought it would be. I'm worried about losing it altogether and it falling back, but at least there are cars behind me (I'm concerned about that - they're lining up and I'm so slow) and the one behind me would stop it. Actually, I kind of wish it would help me by pushing. But finally I get it up to the top, very slowly, very slowly, bit by bit. As it gets on level ground one wheel at a time, I'm more relieved. I pull it off to the side so the traffic can get past and rest. This isn't exactly outdoors any more, by the way, it's some sort of department store. I think about what I need to do to get it the rest of the way home. (292 words)

I'm in London, having been here on a vacation, and getting ready to go home. I'm travelling on an "alternative" airline, it's got stewardesses and a regular plane and all but it sure isn't as professional and organized as, say, Pan Am, or any other one I know for that matter. I'm with a group, like a large tour group or charter, though I haven't been with them in England, just the flight. We're just getting on the plane, bustling with luggage and all, the stewardesses are trying to get it all organized, and it's not coming together very well. They have uniforms - dresses - but they sure aren't very attractive, quite dull. And they seem not especially nice - not rude, but detached, a bit frustrated, not sharp at all. We, the passengers, are helping to get the luggage stowed, and some of us are instructed to go up to the top of the plane (outside), where we hand luggage down a ladder - well on the side. It's bright daylight, getting to the tail end of the afternoon. I'm talking to an older woman about my trip, and telling her how extraordinary it was that I had run into 3 - was it 3? - well, 2 at least - people I knew. I started to tell about one of them and then remembered Elizabeth. Oh, yes, I said, it was 3! I forgot Elizabeth Hilbish! And proceeded to describe her situation with the guy she met in Hawaii, but somehow the woman I'm talking to isn't paying attention. She keeps on misunderstanding and I keep saying, no, it was this... There are others up here, and crew on the ground doing things, and there comes a box or something being passed through that the older woman says she won't touch. She's already done that before, and it's just too heavy, and why are we having to do all this anyway? So we're just watching. Eventually, things seem to be complete and the rest of us are waiting for instructions, when there's some sensation of the plane moving, and we suddenly wonder, what if the pilot forgot to check whether we were off the roof and took off? Given the level of competence of the whole crew, it's possible. (By the way, on this roof are large round - shoulder-high - barriers around the edges, we've been leaning against them; they're soft, like hard rubber or something.) Just as we're reassuring ourselves that nothing like that can happen, it does. The plane moves a bit forward and starts to nose upward. We start screaming for help, "No! Stop! We're still up here! You can't take off!" et cetera, and we're joined by people on the street below, mostly kids. This plane is sitting right in the middle of a neighborhood with nice houses and lots of green trees. Somehow it doesn't need to taxi, but just goes straight up to take off, nose first, which apparently bends, because it's going up but we're not. There are all these kids shouting at its nose as though it were an animal, like a horse or cow, and they were trying to get its attention. They're trying to communicate to the pilot, there are people on the roof. It does stop, just in time, and I'm starting to fume. I swear I'll never use this airline again as long as I live. The panic was awful, I was trying to hold on to the rail and knowing there was no way I could hold on in flight - no question about it, I'd be dead. I pictured us just flying off the roof one by one, and this asshole pilot not even caring. Apparently the crew thought it was our own lookout for us to get back inside. (638 words)

I have these white mice, 5 or 6 at least, and I need to get them into their little separate containers. They've got these boxes, plastic I guess, that they need to be in, I guess so they can be moved somewhere. I've been trying to make them nice for the mice, and I've put some stuff in the bottom, and also a layer of white stuff that mostly looks like salad dressing, so they can have something to snack on. I get one of the mice and put it in its box, but it looks like I got too much of the salad dressing in there because it just slips and gets submerged in it. I take it out, and my word it's just all over salad dressing, how awful. I certainly didn't mean for this to happen, he must be feeling just awful being covered with salad dressing. I'll have to clean him up, but how do you clean a mouse covered in salad dressing? I'm sorry. How stupid. (171 words)

I'm in a bus (school-bus type) with Jimmy - he's driving - it's dark and the road is wind-y, goes by a creek, with a nice bit of green bank and trees between, lower than the road. It's been raining, and might again. We're not travelling so fast as all that, but the turns are coming faster and tighter, so Jimmy's having a time keeping up. Well, here we go anyway - off the road, there's a turn he knows he can't make, so we're off onto the grass, and he's trying to keep from running us into the creek. This bus has a lot of momentum, so we have to do quite a bit of swerving and changing to keep the sucker out of the trees and the creek and maybe come to a stop or get back on the road. (142 words)

I'm on a bicycle, in a hurry to get somewhere. I decide to cut through to another street by going down a side street I haven't been on before. This street - it's only a block's worth, really - is just lovely. It's got big, arching green trees with huge ivy-covered trunks, and cute little houses. Because of the trees being so big with such interwoven branches, it's rather dark, but cool, gentle, lovely. I'm really surprised, how come I don't know about this street? Does anybody? The residents probably are very careful to keep it nice. Anyway, at the end of it, it goes into a sort of park. It's connected to a school, and I can cut through the grounds this way. I weave my way on my bike through various schoolyard paraphernalia, including a football game. I get the impression the coach is not too keen on this, so I hustle and duck into a building - a gym or something - still riding - until I can make my way out the other side to the street.

I'm driving in somewhat of a hurry, and stop at the light. There's a car in front of me, and it doesn't go when the light changes. I honk & yell but nothing happens, then a barrier arm comes down and blocks the road as if it were a railroad track. Now I'm really mad, and when the thing lifts and everybody else drives off, I basically just do a No process, wave my arms and yell and even get out of the car and pound on the side. Finally I get back in and drive off. It helped some. Where I go is some kind of institutional building - I have an appointment for consultation, I think with Ted Danson. He's tied up at the moment, I'm waiting. There's a flight of stairs in the center of the floor with no railing. Also a dog or cat here that I'm very glad to see, an old friend. [A nice friendly feeling is part of this - I am liked here, I feel wanted.] I'm in a room with at least one other person when a guy pops in looking for a different room, he's come to apply for a job. I can see there's something unusual about him, then realize he's handicapped. [The actual nature of the handicap isn't specified.] He's wearing a suit and he's very insecure, almost bumbling. He has a musical instrument with him, and it has various parts to it. I tell him where he needs to go, and after he leaves I see he's dropped one of these parts. I take it down to the room - it's a classroom, and the teacher is up front, he's already had the guy go into his office. I wait at the side (like we do at the Training with Trainer notes) and he nods and beckons me over. I show him the part and he says he'll take care of it. He makes a joking remark about the guy, not quite disparaging but close. He (the applicant) hasn't made a very good impression so far. (325 words)

I'm in an office, I think, or some place that's not a house - it gives onto the street. There's a man here attacking someone I'm with, he's trying to rob us, I think. I have a spray bottle of water (like the one I use on Rouse) and while they're grappling I spray the attacker with it. At first it's hard to hit him anywhere that counts, but then I get him right in the face and throw him off balance. I keep spraying him, and he tries to come after me, but I keep just barely out of his reach. The struggle ends up going outside into the street. (It's a business district, a sort of minor street, no traffic but there are people about, who gather and watch. Smallish brick stores and office buildings.) The man keeps making lunges, but I keep from being grabbed solid and get in another spray. At last he gets turned around just right, and we can grab him and pin his arms. All over. Now we can call the police. I'm with a number of other people outside a barnlike building on the grounds of a rather country-looking house - it's not out of town but in an old section, this is more like a tiny farm than a big back yard. Big trees, weathered wood, everything all green and overgrown. There's a sort of deck outside the barn with small tables and chairs on it. There are also wood rail fences around the property. It's not a sunny day. We're here as a sort of meeting, not formal but to discuss something, a project, it's somewhat political in nature. I'm not actually part of this group but they want me to discuss this business with them. I don't feel adequate to that, frankly, I don't know that much about it, but they seem to think it'll be worthwhile. Lori's supposed to be coming too, but she's late if she's coming at all. I'm bothered about that, impatient. There's food here, we're having sort of a picnic, and the others are going inside but I want to stay outside for a bit, sit in the air and collect myself. I've come to a place where there's a big open wood building, kind of a cross between a garage and a barn. You can park head-in on dirt right in front, and I've brought the Toyota here to pick up this white truck (small, like the Toyota). Someone was supposed to come with me but didn't. I meet somebody inside and settle things up, but now that I'm leaving I get on a bicycle and start to ride away. The road goes around a stand of trees in front, and just as I go around the curve I stop, realizing I've got to at least take the truck back. So I go back, put the bike in the truck and go. I'd rather have ridden the bike, but at least this'll be faster. (501 words)

I've just come home from work - I live in a house in a place a lot like where we've lived in suburbs - Tree and Alleycat live with me, but the 3rd is a fluffy white cat. When I come in I'm in very good spirits and think about getting outdoors, maybe go for a walk right away like I used to (only I never used to, but the memories are in my mind). I figure I'll at least go to the mail box, which is for some reason far away. I could have stopped by in the car but didn't think about it. So, inside this nice-looking suburban house, I've come in the back door, gone through the kitchen, and realized Alleycat is outside - has been all day, he got out and wouldn't come in. So I go to the front door through a sort of dining room or den - it doesn't actually have furniture in it, but that's its location. It has a ceiling fan, which I turn on. At the front door, the other 2 cats go out, I guess to do their business, and there's Alleycat, along with something on the ground, it seems to be a present for Alleycat. It would appear he has an admirer, and he's been getting these notes. [I'm not positive, but it may be that she took him away in the morning and brought him back just before I got home.] Anyway, it's dinnertime, and the idea is we all should come in now, please, and it takes a couple of requests. Tree comes in first, then the white cat, then Alleycat. (There's a screen door, so it's okay that the front door is standing open all this time.) I gather up Alleycat and his presents and go inside. I turn off the overhead lights - there are 4 buttons, dimmers, and I hit them wrong a couple times before I get it right. Then I'm gonna turn off the fan and forget where the switch is for a minute (it's on the opposite wall, into the kitchen). I can see out the glass back doors (sliding) the nice green hill beyond - I used to live a few streets over that way, there's a creek between, too, and I'm wondering if there's a passage over the creek without going all the way around. That's where I still get mail. (379 words)

I'm in a living room of sorts with 2 other people, at least one is male, and they're friends, but I can't name them. We're sitting talking. Somebody may be just moving in here, but I'm not sure it's me who lives here. Outside on the deck - very like my real one, but not obscured by the trees - is a great deal of stuff, mostly if not all electronics, stereo equipment, some quite large. It's not night, but it's either overcast or twilight, rather dim outside, and inside we don't have any lights on so it's barely enough to see by. I get up, and go into the front room to check the deck through the window, and lo and behold, there's actually somebody taking things away! I see 2 men carrying something between them. For a second I freeze, then go right back and say, "There's somebody on the deck - call 911", meaning to go do something else myself, but the others don't move - instead they look perplexed, like "Who, me?" So I do it myself, at the phone right in the middle of the room. I'm not actually sure I've pressed the buttons right because I don't hear a ring, but a voice comes on the line - and I'm not sure what she said. I hesitate, then ask if this is 911. She says it is, but she doesn't quite believe I'm serious. She says am I sure, and do I really want the police, something like that - she seems to know who I am, and is really dubious, as if she knows something about me that makes me unreliable and she shouldn't take the call too seriously. But in the end she says okay, and I put the phone down. I go through the room [It's as if there's no opposite wall, and it continues into another sort of building] and come to a steep place where it's darker and rather like a great marble hall, the upper reaches - or at least middle - and a series of very narrow, steep "steps", are cut into the space. I need to tell somebody here about the robbery, and I do - there's somebody taking a message to somebody else - and now I'm climbing back down. (You can't walk upright on these steps.) (377 words)

I've just arrived at this place where Jenny and Cathy and I are going to do Bio-Energetics - it's a living room, with a couch and TV and all, but it's part of a place where people come, like a club or the Y or a local rec. hall, maybe. We've never come here before. When Bettye and I arrive, we get started talking, and Jenny is looking at us funny - then she says something like, "Are we going to exercise or what?" I'd actually forgotten, I'm quite comfortable just sitting on the floor talking. (I'd asked Bettye if she'd seen something on TV - maybe Twin Peaks.) So we get started, though not in our usual circle of up-and-down pumping. Jenny is experimenting with that yoga pose where you stand with one leg over your head and you grab your foot. I tell her that the trick is in the standing leg. I was going to say the hip, too, but forgot. For demonstration, I do it myself and find that it's actually easier than I remember. I touch my foot to my head, and then reach it higher and over; then, because it seems like fun, I bend forward and reach the foot all the way to the ground. I didn't realize I could do that, a very interesting feeling - not a real pose, of course, I haven't really stretched and placed everything, and didn't stay in the pose, but fun. I point this out to Cathy, who's watching. Shortly some other people come in, a couple with 4 little kids. They're not part of our group, and we don't know why they're here, but we figure we can live with them being here if they're quiet enough. We'll see. But then some more come, an even larger family, and they're not as quiet. Apparently they don't know we've reserved this room, and have come in for some meeting or whatnot, and now there's just too many of them. (The room has gotten a lot bigger, by the way - now it's the size of a meeting hall or small gym.) We're going to have to tell them we've reserved the room and please leave. I'm in a little apartment that a male friend lives in, and he's taking a shower before we go somewhere. I'm poking around, looking at his magazines and books, and his sister comes in. We don't know each other, so we introduce ourselves. She just popped in for a visit, and I tell her he's in the shower; we go over to the bathroom door and try to get his attention. We wave hands in front of the door and call, but it takes a few tries. She finally stands in front of the door herself to talk to him. She's nice, I like her. Dark brown hair like his, both good-looking, she's well-dressed, friendly, comfortable to be around. (488 words)

I'm at work. (Looks nothing like the library, it's a rather dim place with yellow light and nothing is recognizable except that it does seem to have open-office landscaping.) I've remembered the orange electrical cord I lent Ted for his meeting and didn't get back, and I ask him where it is. He says he let Theo take it away, he doesn't know what she did with it. So I ask Theo, and she's getting ready to go out of the office with this group of people on some errand, but they will be going near where she put the cord, so if I want to come along and fetch it I can. Even though she says this, she looks and sounds uncomfortable, as if she feels guilty, or shouldn't be asking me to join them. I get the distinct impression I'm considered a liability. But I want that cord, and I'm already pissed at it having been passed around, especially to Theo, so I go. We walk quickly, and go into the back part of the building, where the "works" are - boiler room, mechanical stuff, storage, etc. On one of the lower floors is my own storeroom where I keep that orange cord. We walk on concrete floors, sometimes they amount to wide catwalks because they're open to the lower floor, and there's many turns - it's like a maze back here. We seem to be walking faster, gradually, and I'm not appreciating it. I'm having to work to keep up and I have the feeling they're trying to lose me. (There's one guy that's really in charge of their group, and I can tell he doesn't want me along.) At one point I get stuck and have to stop for a minute. (Shoelace untied, or caught on something, or drop something, I forget.) They don't stop, but keep right on plowing ahead. I see them at a distance go through an outside door. As I get loose and go after them, I'm getting really mad. I go through the door, and see the group ahead of me, and call out "THEO" in my yelling-at-Rouse voice, very authoritative and imperative. I have to do it twice before they stop and I can catch up. I point out that I was held up back there, and it's hard to catch up when they've gone on ahead so fast. I'm looking fierce, and Theo's nervous. We continue around to the front of the building, where there's a driveway and parking lot. They go across the rows of medians, where there are hummocks and puddles because it's been raining. Now it's starting to rain again, even. People are out here waiting for buses, including Linda Thomas. I stop and she comes up to me and tells me about some other interesting new thing she's just gotten into, or hold of, or something. She tells me Jenny's been using this one particular thing (a fruit or vegetable) with this, it really works. While I'm out here, a girl comes up to say hello - she looks familiar, and just as I've got her placed as a LT graduate (who used to come and do things with us, but we haven't seen her in a long time) she says I bet you don't remember who I am, and I say her first name's Norma (right) but I'm sorry I can't remember your last name - she says that's ok. She's very friendly. (579 words)

I live in an apartment that's almost exactly like the one that I left, and there are at least 5 cats here. Tree, maybe Alleycat, and Rouse, for sure, but in addition there are some others, of various sizes, and they're quite recent, they've just come to live here for reasons unknown - they're not babies, but they're special, I don't know why. The fact is that some Arabs want them; they want them a lot - I don't know how I know that, except that it's a done deal, and it's up to me to try and protect them from being kidnapped. [I'm not sure abt. the sequence of events, so I'm gonna say one thing, and then another, and if it doesn't seem to work out, so be it...] Gary S. is here with me, he's just arrived, I guess, and I have just discovered that the Arabs have stationed themselves outside, sort of unobtrusively, but quite visible just the same, and I'm thinking I'll call the police. I'm trying to show them to My cousin through the window, but they're not that easy to see without also showing yourself. He's not entirely convinced of this, but just the same he can see one of them and there isn't any earthly reason for an Arab dressed up like that to be leaning against a tree down on the ground. So he - like My cousin will - admits (that it seems) this is true. I'm wanting to call the police, but for some reason I guess I don't, because they don't come - I think that we thought that they wouldn't, because after all it's just cats, and why would they want to kidnap a cat? See, I don't know precisely what they want to do with them. They may have some special use for them that they don't normally, but I can't gamble on that. They may even be wanting to sacrifice them for some reason, or do something terrible to them (and I won't sit still for that, because I like them). So I'm worried about what's going to happen here. Another thing is that I'm out in the car with my mom, and we stop at something on the order of a 7-11 for something to drink, and I'm needing to get back home because of the Arab situation. Something happens there, at the 7-11, that worries me - I don't remember what it is - but we have to get back in the car in a hurry and go on back. Lo and behold, when we come back, there they are, visible this time, and in fact I'm not living in an upstairs apartment now - this is a house, and there's a porch, and there they are sort of hanging around the front door. Now, the fun part is, they are just sort of idling there - my mom and I walk up to the front door, and I don't know what the hell they're going to do. I can't afford to be too scared about it, and it's important to get in the door, you know - so we just march brazenly through them (there's about 4 or 5), and they don't do anything at all. I get to the door, and move very quickly - we get in through it, and slam it shut, but don't get it slammed shut quite fast enough, because I guess what they were waiting for was for me to open the door, because they now try to force their way in the door. I can't hold it real hard, but there is a post - an upright, right behind the door, which is very convenient, because what it means is I can get up and brace my back on the pole and hold the door shut with my feet, which I do. I get the door all the way shut and locked, and they have to give up, which is great. Now, I don't know what the point was in them waiting for the door to be open, because after I look around, it's quite clear that they have gotten in and taken the special cats, which is a worry, and the next thing is that I'm worried about them coming back and also grabbing my cats. I don't know quite what to do about that at the moment, and what's also clear is that I have to try and rescue the other cats. I'm gonna have to find out where they are, and go and get 'em back. This is scary - but the fact is, that I don't know how dangerous it is, so it seems important to me that I might as well try. Maybe it's not as hard as it seems, and I cannot give up without a fight, basically. By the way, the setting for all of this is as though it were late afternoon or early morning - the light is not bright, though it is daylight, and there's that sort of mild gloom that you get when it's one of those times you don't have the lights on inside. You can see, like to talk to each other, or move around; you'd want to turn a light on to read by if you wanted to do that - it might even be trying to rain outside. (870 words)

I'm in a dressing room (or locker room, or a large ladies' room) putting on makeup, getting ready for a date. I've been by myself for a while, or with a friend, and a group of other girls comes in. They line up at the counter with their gear, and this one crowds in on me where I am at the left side of the counter. They seem to have just come from an aerobics class or something. (I haven't - I've just been at work all day.) She says something snotty and I don't actually reply, but it's also true that I was just finishing, and say that all she had to do was ask. I pick up my stuff - a whole makeup kit and large bag of gear - and go. This date is a set-up thing, sort of blind date, with Prince. He doesn't know who he's going out with. (154 words)

I'm at a LT - not sure if I'm in it or on team, it might be a focus course or not, but it's being held outside in a nice place with trees. The trainees are all on folding chairs. I'm going for a bathroom break, and 2 or 3 other girls follow me. The bathroom is in a rickety little building next to this open space where the trainees are, and the whole place seems to be fairly old, dates at least from the 40's, very country, may be (or have been) a farm, that sort of construction and fixtures. As I go into the bathroom, the others are not far behind, and I'm figuring we'll all come in together though I'm not keen on that, and as I step in I push the door to behind me, a bit harder than I planned on, because it almost shuts, and they stop outside, presumably because they think I want to be alone. I feel uncomfortable about that - I don't want to shut anybody out. Actually, I'm not alone anyway. Bill Cosby is in here, and he's being very talkative, telling me about his family, asking how mine is and how I am, all while I'm sitting on the toilet. It's in a partial stall without a door, so he can see me, and I keep my skirt (the big ivory one) pulled down around me. This is rather awkward, too, but it doesn't seem to bother him - actually he takes no notice and just goes right on talking. I have my pee, but that problem starts again, where I can't quite get finished - as soon as I think I've stopped, the urge comes back and I can't get up till a few more drops come out and then it starts over. I get wearier and wearier, all the while knowing the girls outside are wondering what the hell I'm doing. (324 words)

I'm going to a kind of flea market with Mom and Marcy. It's a bit of a drive out of town, and we got started late, so there's not a lot of time left. It's at least partly in a building, with corridors, and alcoves and rooms where people have set things up. I'm seeing some nice things, doilies and artificial flowers and china and even some sculpture, all white. Antique furniture, ladies in ruffled gowns. Odd sort of place. There's a larger space with a lot of empty tables, it looks like a lot of people have gone already. That's a little disappointing, but mostly we just think we'd better hurry to look at the rest.

An outside room or porch, windows all around but shaded, a screen door, concrete steps outside, driveway, lawn, trees, next-door house, very suburban neighborhood, in here porch-type furniture, dark, crowded. There's a sort of refrigerator in here, has compartments, meant for a specific purpose to do with freezing things including live animals. I discover a kitten in here, I think it's not supposed to be here and I ask this guy that's around if I should take it out - he says yes. (He's in his 20s, blonde, husky - no scientist, but he's in charge of whatever it is we're doing.) So I get it out and help it thaw, and it comes to life just fine (as if this was a really normal thing) and starts to poke around. It finds the door and wants to go outside but it's not quite up to that yet, so I grab it - I need the guy's help - he's outside the door and he helps me get it back in and latch the door.

I'm working in a plant where there are all these chemical-storage things and all sorts of safety precautions need to be taken. It's not a real big place; it's rather old, and the plant part is fronted by a little house - used to be a house, now it's a sort of large office with tables and files, etc. Reminiscent of the 50's, all rather dreary. Nobody's English, but the place seems to be in the center of London (well, if not the actual center, then at least well into urban stuff), and I've just changed apartments, and that's where I live. This place is mostly staffed by men, probably union men, who are very clubby and don't like management telling them what to do, or any interference in the way they do things, which is none too careful or efficient. I'm not management, but part of my job is safety control, and they don't like me already because I'm a woman. I've been trying to talk to this guy in charge about something that I've seen. It has to do with a yellow powder that's highly toxic, and I suspect it's leaking. He won't listen to me, keeps putting me off and evading. There are some others who know what I'm talking about, but they won't or can't get involved. I'm feeling very frustrated, with that nagging, foreboding feeling in my stomach. The day has worn on, and there's a sort of cocktail party after working hours, so everybody's stayed over. (Rouse is here with me, by the way, there was some reason she had to come along and I couldn't take her home in the middle of the day. There's also a stray dog I'm looking after.) I'm trying to work out how to get to talk to people about this problem while they're a sort of captive audience, I'm really concerned. A girl who works here beckons me over to a corner of the room and behind a door where nobody can see us. (The outside door is in the middle of the far wall - it actually faces north - and the door to the factory/plant is up here in the southwest corner; it's propped open.) We talk about this leakage problem a bit, but she doesn't think there's anything we can do, and warns me that I'm liable to get in trouble if I keep after it. I'm arguing that dammit, I have to - somebody has to, or something really bad is going to happen. We go into the plant to look at things, and Rouse comes along. Just inside the door there's this big thing all iron and great big nuts and bolts and suchlike - the whole place seems to be boilers and steel vats and stuff - this thing is maybe 4' high and has a bolted-down cap on it. Rouse jumps around it and I want to get hold of her, when I get a good look at this thing and see, not traces, but quite a lot of that yellow powder has oozed out of the lid. This is terribly dangerous. The stuff is positively deadly if it gets loose. While it's sitting still it's not too bad, but it can't get airborne. (I don't know if it's deadly to inhale or to get it on you.) We look at each other, horrified, and run back inside. I start yelling for everybody to get out, and they hesitate at first, but they do go. There is some question about whether I have the authority to do this, but I really don't care - it's in the back of my mind, and part of me wonders what will happen, but I go on yelling and herding people out. Finally they're all gone and I'm rounding up Rouse and the dog, getting ready to go myself. Down at the end of the room where the outside door is, is a bed and a television set. (Don't ask me why - it just seems like they're part of my personal furnishings, as though this were my "office", and I can lie around and watch game shows when I want to.) Under the bed is a small suitcase I've brought in to change from my outside clothes to work clothes because of my move (something to do with the reason I brought Rouse). I fetch it out and get on the bed to change clothes, which is basically from a big sweaty T-shirt to a cleaner one, and (put on? take off?) my big black boots (with heels). I lay there and watch TV for a bit, then realize I'd better get the hell out, so I round up everybody and go out the door. There's a little vestibule here, and it's night now, and now that I'm here I realize we've got more passengers than I thought. In the shadows of the vestibule is another cat, and now by George there's another dog too. Not the same kind, and I don't know where he came from, and I'm wondering how I'm going to deal with all these animals. My new landlady may not take kindly to 2 dogs and a 4th cat. Also, how am I going to drive the car with all this lot? (883 words)

I'm with my family in the family house, an old, slightly ramshackle place [about the caliber of Melanie's mom's house in age and construction, but the neighborhood is more suburban], not great big - though we're a pretty big family, most of the kids are grown and don't live there. I'm the next-to-youngest (I'm about 18 or 20). Patrick Duffy is my older brother, and he's been kidnapped and just been rescued and brought home, so all of us are here and having a sort of family reunion. Most of us are outside, getting ready to go someplace, and he's on the porch [ground level - small]. I've just come through the door, and our younger sister (she's maybe 9 or 10) behind me, and seeing him there, flesh and blood, alive and well, and I just have to hug him again. I'm feeling very emotional - we all just adore him, and we're a close family - I just want to hold onto him for a bit longer. So does my little sister, she joins in, and another one or 2 from the other side. Letting go after a bit, now I'm going back in the front door into the living room. [It also has a lot of the qualities of Melanie's mom's house - tacky brown/yellow flowered couch, fringed lamps giving off dull yellow light, tacky coffee tables, tacky knick-knacks.] There's a few other people in here - particularly, on the couch to the right of the door, is a fat old woman - she's from some European country, and I think she's Patrick's mother-in-law. She's a grump anyway, and she's glowering across the room at [Kathy ?] one of my other female relatives, who's standing talking to an older man (or 2), and she has a section of the newspaper in her hand that the old bat wants to read. She thinks she's supposed to be catered to, of course, though nobody else does, and she's spending a lot of her time pissed off. She looks up at me and I get the very clear message that she expects me to fix this for her, and for a moment I look from one to the other, askance. I find it rather amusing but I sure ain't going to look it where she can see me, so I just give a sort of polite half-smile and go on my merry way. I go through into another room, which is dark, and then to the kitchen, ditto. Outside it's almost dark, and the back of the house has that gloomy light. Somehow I know that something's wrong. It's just a creepy, "off" feeling, as if I know somebody was watching me, or something was moved that shouldn't have been. I start to worry that maybe this whole business isn't over, that even though my brother is back home, the bad guys may still be plotting something - maybe they're even hiding in the house, maybe they'll kidnap him again, or another one of us, maybe even me. Suddenly I'm uncomfortable being by myself. Now I'm in a neighbor's house [a rather basic suburban-type house] with a friend - we're not buddies, but our families have known each other a long time - and I'm waiting to see what happens next. This woman is grown, but she still lives with her mom and dad and kid brother; she's a little bit simple - maybe retarded, but could be something else. She keeps changing who she thinks she is, not her real name and where she lives and that, but she plays new roles every now and then as she changes interests. She'll suddenly latch on to something new and exciting, and pretend to be somebody else. Right now she's trying to be Robin to my Batman, sort of. (I actually am a detective - or something like it - but I'm more nearly Sherlock Holmes, I don't do Batman stuff.) We were out having some sort of adventure just now - she showed up while I was working on a case and she actually did help some, I figure I can be tolerant and let her indulge herself for a while, she'll change to something else anyway after a while. Meanwhile she's got herself a detective trench coat and detective slouch hat and looking very Bogart-like. So I'm sitting on the couch while she's telling her mom and brother all about it - her mom's been doing housework [she's pretty much of a drudge] and she's just going, "Uh-huh" ("big deal") ("oh, sure"), "uh-huh." The daughter gets up to go into another room, and I call something after her, using her name, and her mother corrects me, saying, "Oh, she's not (that) any more, now you have to call her (?)." And I say, oh, I see, sure. (747 words)

I'm in a bus, just got on, and I'm choosing a seat toward the back. This bus is rather old-looking, and broken up into sections (actually it's not a lot like a bus, but more like a train, with cars & rooms, but not separated). I want a seat in the back because it's nicer there, more sunlight. Before I get settled, though, I want a drink of water. Around a corner there's a concession stand - actually a large counter, wood base and glass front, right out of the 30's or 40's, with a middle-aged man and his (wife? daughter?) running it. I thought there'd be a water fountain, but no such luck, and I don't want a Coke or anything, that they're selling. But I see that there's a dispenser bottle on one end of the counter - a black girl is using it (she's from a whole troop of ghetto-type kids that are occupying this side of the bus, bustling around the counter and being noisy) and I figure if you could get a cup without paying for it you could get some water.

I'm in a hotel with a woman and a boy (my mother and brother?). We're moving, and staying here while our belongings are in transit - this is the new town we're in. It's a nice hotel, quite formal. We're going into the restaurant for lunch, which has a maitre d' and snooty waiters and tablecloths and stem water glasses. Mom is being officious, she's a little anxious about something, and keeps reminding us of things. (She's blonde, by the way, sort of your TV career-mother; the boy is a nondescript typical young teenage boy.) I go in with them, but I have to go do something - I'll come back later. [Where I go isn't clear, but it involves My brother, my real brother, who gives me some reassurance about something. We're in what I think is an attic-room, at least it's definitely upstairs in a building, and we're standing next to a window - all through, the time is midday, nice weather, bright sunshine.] When I come back, mom and brother are gone, but I'll stay and eat lunch anyway. I get seated next to this nice-looking man in a suit, also dining alone, who says "hello", and we have a pleasant conversation. I look at the menu - a fancy-restaurant menu, tall, with elegant script and no prices, heavy vellum stock, tied at the back - and order a pasta dish, something cheesy and unspectacular. It's good, but afterward I get the bill and gasp. This is a lunch price? I thought I was being conservative. The man next to me agrees that it's rather high, but he's used to it. I need to go out for an errand (I may have done this before finishing my meal), so I go into another part of the hotel through a side door. There's an area in the back with some offices, and I go past some elevators and around a corner, and there's a small office with a glass front tucked back here. Two people are standing in it, a man and a woman. There's some colorful waiting-room lounge furniture and plants, and a wall or partition behind them. I go in and talk to them for a minute - we agree on something, and I go back to the restaurant. Having settled the bill, I have a copy of the menu in my hands, which is odd because they took it when I ordered. (Perhaps it was on an empty table and I picked it up to look at it again.) Well, I think I'd like to take it with me, but I suppose they'd rather I didn't. My "companion" points out that perhaps I could leave by the back door, and I agree. So I do, and go quickly back through the corridor I was in before, and to the office. There's a back entrance just before the elevators that I could have used, but I'd rather not be that conspicuous. Now that I'm at the office, I see they've left and closed it up. I look around, and just opposite is an exit door, the sort of "emergency" exit that has a bar to push. I don't know if it will set off an alarm or not, but I'll be long gone before anybody gets there if it does. I step out, and I'm at the back corner of the building, next to the parking lot. I walk that way and go look for my car. (527 words)

I'm on a bus in the morning, got to get school - I'm late. School's just started and I don't want to be late, it's a bad way to start off. I look at my watch and see that I only have 10 minutes to get there - this bus won't do it, we've got to get off. The bus stops, and we're going to walk (or run), but we have to go through this house. For some reason it's the only way to get there. It's not occupied at the moment, I think - at least nobody's home - but there is "someone" there. I'm not sure if it's a human. This "person" has a riddle or question we have to answer before we can get through the house. It's on a sort of flip-chart that he shows us, lifting up the top page to show what's printed on the next. I feel frustrated, but I know this is the only way so I look at it and try to think. It shouldn't be hard. But we're running out of time. (182 words)

I'm at the office, checking the mail. I have an envelope, it's squarish, about the size of a greeting card, and thicker than usual. I look at the return address, which is Penny's, and I realize she's written me, and I'm thrilled. I also think that the thickness must mean that she's enclosed a copy of her jewellery price list - oh, boy! I'm just overjoyed. To think she'd be writing me already! How nice! (75 words)

I'm motivating down the street on this weird little cart. It's kind of a cross between my "back" chair and a railroad pushcart: very low, made of wood (could almost have been made from an orange crate), you sit on it and pump this bar and it sort of scoots forward. It doesn't exactly have wheels but it goes, or at least it usually goes - just now I'm having trouble with it. I've come up to this corner to meet with my group - we're sort of entertainers, like street musicians (but I don't know what we all do) and Fred is our leader, more or less. We're just gathering together here to get ready for something, but I'm not staying, I've got errands and I'm letting them know. So I go on down the street on my little cart, and it won't "roll" - it just drags along most of the time and then sticks. I have to get up and pull it. I think I look real stupid doing this, and the others are probably wondering why I don't give it up, but I keep it up anyway. I go a bit further, very near my apartment, and run into Sandie, who's just coming this way. She's been staying in my apartment for a while - I've been gone, and I've just come back. She's saying to me that everything's been okay, she got along great, no prob, and she hopes that the landlady didn't mind that the rent check was a little bit short because she was real tight for money right now and she'll make it up later. This surprises me but not a whole lot because Sandie does actually pay her debts, and it should be okay - I'm thinking she only means 3 or 5 dollars. I ask her how much short it was, and she says a hundred dollars. Now I am horrified. A HUNDRED DOLLARS? You've got to be kidding! That is it. That is absolutely the last straw! You have taken advantage of me and I will not stand for it. You get your stuff and get out. You will not do this to me ever again. Et cetera. She's kinda surprised, and says she's sorry, but looks more bewildered at my reaction than anything else. We go inside (this is a complex, and has interior hallways), and pass by the next-door apartment. The lady who lives there has the door open and greets me as we pass by, she's a friend. I go inside, but I can't go all the way in - the entrance is through the kitchen and Sandie's moved a couple of tables into the middle so you can't get by. This apparently is because they're cleaning the carpet or something. Afterward, I go in my car to a friend's apartment - I have something to deliver to her. I knock, and there's a slight delay before she answers, and when she opens the door she doesn't look like I remember her. She's short, a bit stout, has medium-light brown hair. She's been asleep or something and isn't wide-awake, but shortly she remembers me, and says ok, bring the stuff in. I go back to the car - parked on the street across from her door - to get it. (This is some sort of printed stuff.) (561 words)

I'm in my office building, having left the office for a break or an errand, and I'm on my way back. This place bears more of a resemblance to where Lori works at the museum than to the library, it's sort of a maze of offices and walls and steps and corridors, but nice anyway, there's light and air. I'm scooting along on my chair (my back chair, only with wheels), and I think people are going to think I'm crazy. I pass a couple of people in the drafting area who turn and look at me. I'm going through some unfamiliar offices because I took a wrong turn somewhere. I'm in my own kitchen, trying to trap a scorpion on the floor with a wad of paper towel. I'm really determined to get it because scorpions are so dangerous, and I've got to be real careful. I'd take it outside if I could, like the cockroaches, but I don't believe I can. It escapes me for a while but I get the paper towel over it and squash it - not very hard, but when I lift it up to see if I've killed it, there's nothing left but goo mostly. I didn't think they were that fragile. (209 words)

I'm at work - sort of - it's the library, but doesn't look normal. Our office is a sort of long alcove, and there aren't any desks - just chairs facing out, lined up along the wall, 4 or 6 of them. I'm on the end away from the wall, and my chair is different. (I guess it's my stool.) There's a rectangular carpet in front of me, rather Persian-looking, but it's pretty thin and flat. It needs to be replaced, and I've put in a request but no response so far. Joe Bearden comes by, to use the copier I guess, and he's the one who deals with these things, so I ask him about it. He says that some measuring has to be done, so I get out my yardstick and we go to it. The carpet isn't actually straight, it turns out; at the spot where it crosses the metal strip on the floor that divides our office it jogs a little bit, and also a bit further on. You can't really see it until you put the yardstick down next to it, but it does mean that the new carpet will have to be specially made to correspond. About this time I realize how late it's getting, and I've got a yoga class to get to. I don't have a car at the moment, and I haven't got another way to get there since it's too late for (the bus?), so I'll have to take a cab. The class is in a place I haven't gone before, it's being held at a middle school almost all the way to my Mom's house. I'm sharing the cab with a guy I know, and he knows how to get there, so he tells the driver, but he doesn't go that way. The guy says that's okay, it's just another way to get there, but the driver seems to prefer this one. Heigh-ho. At the school, we pull into a sort of enclosed carport, and I get out. I don't know where to go, but there are a number of kids about, so I ask a boy who's with a group on the stairs. He doesn't know himself, but says he'll go in and ask a teacher. When he comes back, he takes me inside to a room that looks like it belongs in a school, rather old and institutional. It's next to a sort of kitchen. The boy introduces me to a teacher who says I can wait here while he goes to locate the class, but his look and manner suggest he thinks it's rather odd for me to be here. And he says he thought the class was just for kids. Well, he goes off to find out how I can get there, and I start wondering if maybe he's right - is this just a class for junior-high school kids? Ooh. I may be very out of place here. (The class, by the way, is one of the regular City Yoga Center classes - I think Fred's teaching. I just haven't ever come to this one before.) The teacher is gone a very long time, during which I doze off for a minute. After a while of poking around bored, I notice that it's flat dark outside. Good grief, how did that happen? I look out the window - I listen - I realize that there's nobody here. A lot more time has passed than I thought. The class is probably even over by now. I'm also concerned about how I'm going to get out of here. If I can find a phone I can call Mom, but that also means I'll have to find an unlocked door. I go towards the kitchen door and realize I'm hearing voices. Walking into the room, I find 2 or 3 women standing in a group, talking. One of them looks particularly startled when she sees me - and as I start to explain myself and ask how I can find a phone, etc., she lays into me like nobody's business, saying, "Don't you pull that stuff on me, I know all about people like you, you'd better get your butt right out of here" - or words to that effect. I apologize for being a nuisance and all and try to talk again, but she starts in again. She's quite pissed. One of the other women starts to speak to me - without the hostility - and the first one goes again. By this time I've had about enough abuse, and I say so. I raise my voice and very firmly tell her I'm not going to take any more crap from her, I want a telephone so I can call my mother to come get me out of this place*. She clams up. Another woman (who I think came up in the middle of this) takes over and says she'll help me out, so she escorts me away. She's very nice, this person - she's rather short, with medium brown hair, nice friendly face and manner if a bit reserved. Next thing, we're in a bathroom; I'm looking at myself in a mirror and we're having a conversation. (872 words)

I'm the director of a play being put on by my little "group" - we're some sort of social or community group, maybe LT. This place is perhaps a local community rec. center, or otherwise a sort of borrowed facility - not fancy, panelled walls, not much furniture, several rooms. We're getting organized in here - it isn't easy, they're all standing around chatting, nonchalant. I'm not feeling at all confident - it's as if somebody else is in charge, and I'm only supposed to do a job when it's my turn, but I know I'll have to take over pretty soon... Eventually we go outside to rehearse. We're doing the play pretty soon and don't have all that much time to get it down. (I think we do it for real this afternoon.) There's a space nearby that we marked out to rehearse in on the grass (this is a public park, though there aren't a lot of people about). There's something (an archery target, I think) at this end of the space, and the actor we're watching at the moment is at the far end nearer the trees. This is Shakespeare, and he's in a costume, maybe Elizabethan, but I think a tad later frankly. He gets rolling, and while he's got it down quite well, he's declaiming in one of those "Shakespearean" voices like there's no tomorrow. Piffle. This really won't do. I'm gonna have to persuade him otherwise, and soon. He moves forward in the scene, and while he's up here near the "target" a couple of girls walk across the space at an angle and go over to a place toward the back and sit down, as if they were at a picnic. They're talking casually as if they don't even notice anything going on. They're wearing long dresses and have long hair. (I'm not actually sure if they're part of the scene or not - I think so.) About now I'm getting more comfortable with this director business, and I'm thinking it's time I put in my two-cents' worth. I do have ideas about how I want this thing to go, and I'm gonna take over now. 
       Later (I think it's the same sequence) I'm going home, walking down a path - brick - through a pedestrian mall between some stores and offices. There are other people out strolling and visiting, very nice atmosphere. It's early evening, just beginning to get dark. I've got my purse under my arm, and something else with me (in a bag?). I stop for a minute to look at something, then go on my way. A short way further on, toward the street, having rounded a corner or two, I realize I've put my package down when I stopped, and left it. I'll have to go back for it. I hope it's still there. I go back, and there it is. I put my purse down to adjust how I'm holding the package, and go on again. I get almost to the street before I realize that now I've left my purse sitting right on the path. Anybody would see it - damn, I'm sure it won't be there now. Oh hell! I go back. As I round the corner near where I left it, I notice a sort of shelf on my right - the sort of thing you see in a restaurant or someplace "decorated", shoulder height, it might have plants on it. At the moment there are other things, personal things, on it, like a purse or two, and one of them resembles mine a bit. I pick it up and look at it, anxious, and of course realize my purse doesn't have a strap, and this one's rounded. I put it back down, thinking surely it belongs to somebody who's around and will think I'm stealing her purse. I turn around again and go a few more steps toward where I left my purse, and it's not on the ground, but I see on my left a table or stand with a woman behind it (large? black?) and by George it's a lost and found, and there's my purse on it! Hooray! I'm so grateful. I tell her it's mine - she listens to me explain and lets me have it back, and I go on back up the path, find the street at last and turn left, on my way home at last.

In a hotel room with Lori and a woman she's recently met - Lori is wanting to work with her on something, but she's rather suspicious that she may not be what she seems. The woman is (or seems) larger and more powerful than us, and while she seems nice enough, there's a definite detachment there. I've just come to tell Lori I think this woman is dealing drugs and is going to get her involved with it. [I don't remember now how I found this out.] I arrive, we all chat for a bit, and I'm impatient because I'm sure she's going to find me out soon [someone else is coming? or a phone call?] and she may be hostile if she finds out. Shortly she has an errand outside, like taking out the trash or something, and I seize the opportunity. I tell Lori what I know, and while there is still some doubt in the matter it seems most prudent to get out now. We have to grab Lori's things fast (she's been staying here for a while - I don't know if it was meant to be permanent) and duck out the front door to the elevator. It's slow, and we get anxious, but it comes and we hustle into it, still clutching all this stuff with sleeves and things sticking out. Now we're inside we can pack it up a bit better. This elevator is actually a little room - there are tables and chairs and lamps, and a window to the outside (it's night, and you can see a bit of the city - we must be on the 10th floor or so), and there are other people in here - it's a bit like a waiting room. I wave Lori to a seat and I take another. (287 words)

Michelle and I are going into a small theater to see Tony Randall. We sit in the balcony and enjoy the first half of the show. Then at intermission I decide I need to change clothes. [I'm not sure if this is because I've spilled something on myself, or because I'm tired of wearing these clothes and want to wear something more casual and comfortable.] We just live across the street (apparently M & I are sisters) in a big house - we seem to have rather a lot of money - the house is tropical or Southwestern in style, red tiled roof, stucco walls, and the grounds are well landscaped - lots of yucca and patio-things, very nice indeed. Michelle goes to her room and does whatever, while I look for something else to wear. I know I'm pressed for time, but it takes me a while to get done. Michelle hears the intermission signal from across the street go, and says it's time - we have to go, but I'm not ready yet. I hurry, and she dashes off. I get finished, and go outside, where I stop (just for a second) to do something - I'm at a low brick wall, curved, around a sort of patio with lawn furniture on it (the wood kind with cushions) - and I see a man coming. I don't know who he is, and I wonder if I should stay around, maybe he's a burglar and if I leave he'll break in. I move off, thinking I'll avoid him, then I recognize him - he's our housekeeper or groundskeeper, he works here (he's an older guy with gray hair, nice-looking, rather dignified, butlerish). It occurs to me that maybe if I didn't recognize him, he doesn't recognize me and he'll think I'm a trespasser. Hmm. Well, I've got to get on, so I start to run - I'm sure the show won't start on time anyway, and I can see from here that there are still people going in (though that doesn't prove they're seeing that show). Before I get to the street, though, I remember something I've forgotten, I need to get my purse, I left it (in my room? on the patio wall?). Oh, hell - how long will it take to get it? Can I push my luck any farther? I hesitate for a minute, then give in and run back for it. (377 words)

I'm with a group of people I work with at a large stadium/auditorium, shortly before some show or event is about to start. The others are talking about another of us who isn't here, something has happened to him - something pretty serious, either he's dead or is having some big trouble - and I don't know what it is. I was gone when this came up, and I'm feeling quite left out and frustrated, because they're assuming everybody knows and not explaining what's happened. Our boss comes along, and he asks me to go off with him, and I tell him what's going on. He seems to have a bit of trouble dealing with this sort of personal thing from his staff, he's very uncomfortable - he does try to explain a little bit, but the whole thing is awkward for both of us. We go along to the inside of the auditorium. Everybody is getting organized, locating their seats, getting their groups together (this is some sort of corporate thing - all these groups are people who work together). We go to one of the tiers and stop where he greets a man that he knows, and they talk. Apparently my boss means to sit here with the other group, but nobody's taking any notice of me - I can't tell if I'm meant to sit here as well, or should I go to be with our own group? I look around for them, and think this place is so big they must be out of eyesight, but then suddenly I discover they're sitting right behind us, a tier up. Hoping to remind him, I tell my boss, "Look! There's our group right behind us!" and he turns - there's also a pillar behind so he has to lean out a bit - and there they are sitting just up there. Good. That's reassuring, at least, I can go right up there. Later: I'm at a hotel that's in an area where there's a lot of other hotels and businesses, maybe it's not far from an airport. I've been here before, at a hotel not far up the road, where some other episode happened like a murder mystery or something. This time I've had car trouble - the water hose [same thing that actually happened yesterday], and this psychiatrist has come to help out. I was at his office with a friend and he drove me back here while she stayed there. We drive back to his office and I park the car in front while he goes in to get my friend and his secretary. It's after 5, and they're getting ready to go out, they're all dressed up. However, as my friend and I go to get into the car, I notice another puddle under the car and more steam coming from under the hood. Oh dear, not again. I say to everybody, "We have another problem", and we're all disappointed. The psychiatrist is frustrated - they really wanted to get on but it looks like sticking around to help me out again.

I'm at work, and we're having the staff Christmas party today - hardly anybody's working and the whole library is decorated (looks rather like a department store - high ceilings, serious glitter, great big displays), and everybody's dressed up. The lights are dim, the whole place is a giant cocktail party. Bonnie and I share a desk, and she's actually working - a couple of guys are here to be interviewed (not for jobs, I think - it's something else we do). I've rented a movie for some of us to watch, we wanted to see a Christmas movie, and boy this was the only one left, practically - I get it all set up, and this one girl says, "Boy I hope you didn't get _____, I have seen that a hundred times and I sure don't want to see it again." Woops. Well, I think I'll just look around for something else to do for a few minutes here... I go back to the desk but these guys are just now ready to be interviewed and I have to get up again. I go a wall or 2 away, and sit down, and Brad Brown shows up for a visit. He does this just about every year, I think, and I'm really glad to see him. I sit and watch and listen for a while, while he visits with various ones of us. Shortly I'm on the 5th floor where the staff association party is in the staff room, and as I come off the front elevators I see all these folks, they're all doing the real cocktail party thing with drinks and long glittery dresses, and tuxes. When I turn to go around the microform tables I hear loud music from behind me, and turn to see this sort of procession coming in from the elevators. They're midgets, couples arm in arm, stepping out in time to some pop music. Then I notice the camera equipment, and realize they're making a music video. After the midgets, a girl singer has come out and is wailing away with a mike while everybody's gettin' down. I decide to sit on the floor and watch a bit - I actually lie down, propping myself up on my elbows. Once I'm settled I find there's a group of people sitting in a ring right in front of me - and right after that I grasp they're all more or less at eye level with me. And immediately after that I realize it's because they're all midgets! That's funny. After watching a bit longer I go on into the staff room, and there's another singer in there - actually rather a big-name entertainer, ain't we uptown? Quite crowded in here. Later I'm at home with Ruben (we live together) and we're wanting to go to the Christmas party but we have a plumbing emergency. We got hold of a plumber, and she came and she's finished now - thank Heaven - but it's a quarter to nine and probably too late to think of going now. We settle up with her (she's rather tall, blonde, and good-looking, good figure - wearing khaki coveralls) and thank her, and ask for one of her cards - we only had her phone number, not an address, and don't know how far she had to come. Would be nice if she was local in case we need her again. She's very nice. I allow as how I need some stamps, so if we're not going to the party how about we go out and get some at the post office? We do that. Outside the building is a stamp dispenser that's a sit-down console where you put in your money and punch buttons. Rolly and I are talking away while I feed a dollar bill into the machine. It starts to work, and then the change starts to come out - but a whole lot of change comes out! I don't even realize it at first because I'm distracted talking to Rolly, then I see this shitload of change. Not small stuff, either, lots of quarters. Must be $30-$50 in here. I poke at it a bit, wondering how I'm going to pick it all up, and thinking maybe I should count it out by type, but a car pulls up and a couple of other people arrive - they're here for stamps too, and they'll be wanting to use the machine. O dear. How do I pick all this up without making a lot of noise and letting them see? They'll probably want to share - or maybe they'll expect me to turn it in - maybe I should - really I should, of course - but geez, you know, I really don't have to, no one would ever know. There's a piece of paper here, and while I'm dawdling (hoping they'll get impatient and go away) (knowing there's no good reason to expect them to) I draw it casually over the pile, and then I notice the machine's belched out a whole bunch of stamps too. O boy. Well, well. Now what? About this time (while I'm still making conversation, but now I'm inserting a lot of "uh..."s and "er..."s) I notice something else odd. It takes me a minute to get it, but then I realize that there's light now, dawn. How in the world can it be morning when just a little while ago it was a quarter to nine at night? Have we been here all bleeding night? (927 words)

I'm in training with a group of other people, about 6 or so, more men than women - they seem to be mostly younger than I am. All of us are in excellent shape - we're learning special skills from an older man, he's a sort of guru. I think we're all training to be superheroes. I have a mutual attraction going with a couple of the guys, both very tentative and innocent. One was already happening, and just tonight in class this other one started making overtures, and I'm quite taken with him now, too. He's really good-looking: tall, muscular, long hair, sweet. (None of the guys are musclebound apes.) Class is just over, and we're getting ready to go home. We train in a private school, I think all boys. I get the impression they're not crazy about us being here, maybe they just want to get in and use the gym. I've turned to a table to pick up some of my things, and one of the girls asks if I'd like to ride with her and some of the others. I say no, because I'd gone earlier to get my car so I'd have it here, but I'm actually sorry I did that now because I'd really like to go with them. (216 words)

I'm in a house. I may live here but maybe it's a long visit, I'm not sure. The people who live here are friends, not my very best ones, I don't know them really well, but we're getting along fine. I have the front room for my bedroom. Right now the others have gone into another room that opens into mine and shut the door. (This includes several people, I think it's a couple of married couples and another friend or 2 - I'm thinking only one of the couples lives here and the others are just pals. We do mix, me and them, but not constantly, so they're doing their own thing at the moment while I do mine.) This room wasn't meant for a bedroom, probably a dining room, so it's not completely isolated. Lori and Renee come to visit, and while I'm not looking they set up a "Christmas tree" for me - not a real tree, but made out of some odd things and it's just wonderful, I'm thrilled. It's sitting on a counter/shelf affair, and I also find they've tucked away a taco salad for me as a present. How neat. It's enormous, and good-looking. I start to dig into it, and they leave. I eat some of the stuff off the top, there's several layers, and eventually uncover some lettuce I hadn't known was there, that's great! I was thinking it was going to take quite a while to eat. About this time the others come out of the room and sit around in my room. I think I'll spend a few minutes on the porch. There's a door from my room, and I go through, thinking I'll play with Doggie a bit, she's outside. Just as I get out, she's running across the street chasing something, maybe a cat. It's a very busy street, she shouldn't be out loose, and I call for her to come back, but I'm anxious that she be very careful. She is; she looks for the traffic and waits till it's clear, then runs across and bounds up to the porch and I give her a rub. She's so nice. Suddenly I hear a noise down on the ground - I hadn't identified it as barks or growls, but when I look I see a group of 3 or 4 dogs getting mixed up with each other and maybe about to start a real fight. I'm disturbed at this, and want them to go away. I make what I mean to be a loud noise and clap my hands, they do stop what they're doing. All but one of them move off, but one - presumably the instigator - looks around and in a flash jumps up on the porch. He's bigger than Doggie, and black, mean-looking. He doesn't attack but skulks around acting threatening. I know I don't want to antagonize him and probably shouldn't make any sudden moves, but I'm scared. I stay still, and call out to the people inside. It takes a couple of tries because at first I wasn't loud enough, trying to be careful. The woman who lives here comes out, seeing the situation, and she's not afraid. She says to me I'd better get inside, so I step back and reach for the screen door - there's another door that I'm closer to - and let myself in carefully. (568 words)

I need a curtain fixed or changed or put up. Bruce Mulkey is here helping me with it, and he asks me for a screwdriver; he's in the bedroom. I start for the kitchen, and stop to turn and ask, "What kind?" He says Phillips. I go to the bag in the kitchen pantry where I keep my tools and pull out screwdrivers. The first 2 are straight - I wonder briefly if a Phillips is in here, but the next thing I get is one. I stop for a second on the way back and when I get back Bruce isn't there anymore, but My ex is. He's in the bathroom doing something with the curtains there. Now, Bruce had been going to borrow or substitute something from one of the curtains in here for the one he was working on in the bedroom, but what My ex seems to be doing is putting up the new curtain in here and taking down the old one. There was a regular-length one over the toilet, under the shelves [for no reason at all - it's just a wall there], and he's taken that down and put a little short one up, just over the toilet - it's about 6" long. It looks silly. I realize I forgot the screwdriver, don't know where I've left it, and go back to look for it, wondering what on earth's going on about the curtains and what to say. I find it where I laid it down on the way through the living room, and I'm surprised - I hadn't realized I'd only brought the blade. (Apparently it's one that can be fitted into a handle, part of a set, though it's quite large for that.) I rectify that and come back to the bathroom. My ex's nearly finished and I don't know what to say to him. I certainly didn't want what he's done, but he'll get mad if I say so when he's doing me a favor. I wish he wasn't here at all - Bruce knew what I wanted and would have done it right - you can't depend on My ex, and he always thinks he's right, doesn't want to be criticized. (362 words)

I'm in a theater where a rock band is about to play. One of the guys in the band is my boyfriend - we haven't been together very long but I'm quite fond of him and it's not a hot & heavy affair. We're still quite shy of each other. I'm sitting in about the 3rd row, center - he got the tickets for me and some friends - and the lights are on while we're still waiting for the place to fill up. Which it is, mostly filling up with teenage girls. I don't feel out of place, but a bit conspicuous. The band is still setting up onstage (the curtain seems to be open) and I get up to go talk to my boyfriend. He's assembling something on the near side to the stage steps on the right, and I squat where he is and talk for a minute, just asking casual questions about what's going on. He doesn't mind. I really like him, and I'm pleased that he'd want me here. He's blond, quite young-looking, real nice guy. I cross the stage for some reason (with him?) and I'm there for a minute or so more, while they're finishing up, and now the stage is set and it's almost time to start. They tell me I need to get back to my seat. I turn, looking for the best way to do that, and then decide to go back the way I came. I feel very conspicuous walking across the whole set now that it's complete, now it seems I don't belong here. (I'm not sure if the curtain is raised or not - it feels as if the audience can see me.) The place is about full now, and the general audience buzz is still loud. I look for my seat, can't find it at first, then I realize somebody's sitting in it. I go up to her and say, "That's my seat" - there's no time to be polite or solicitous, the show's about to start. She hesitates for a minute, but I get a bit more forceful, "Come on, that's my seat - go away", and she does. Looks a bit surly but I don't care. I sit down, full of anticipation and excitement.

I'm outdoors, in an area with a lot of trees and open space, away from downtown, though you can see it over the tops of the trees. [Something is happening that involves mention of a hospital.] I'm going to walk up to the street [and do something, maybe I'm going for a car or a cab or an airplane]. As I walk over a slight rise, I can see more of downtown and the power lines that crisscross the air. On one of them are two figures, much larger than life but somewhat smaller than parade balloons - one's Batman (black suit and cape, like the movie), and the other one's female, and they're lying on the wire, embracing as if they're making love, but with all their clothes on. She's got long dark hair and dark clothing. I don't know precisely who she is, but I accept this as quite normal. It's apparently some sort of promotional stunt for the next Batman movie. What it appears to be is two real people inside some sort of giant costumes, and they operate inside them as if it was themselves. As I walk, watching from time to time, they get more vigorous. Out of the corner of my eye it looks quite real. Finally their humping gets real exaggerated, and they raise up in the air high enough to turn over backwards and fall off. As you might expect, Batman "flies" down, doesn't drop like a stone, and goes out of sight behind something. I'm still walking on, and now I see the two of them standing on a rise, their arms out, facing more or less my direction, their mouths open. They're singing, but I'm too far away to hear. More of the promotion. Up in the sky, there are little private planes from time to time - actually quite a lot of traffic - and now some of them are towing banners that say, "Batman". I pass by them and come to Lloyd's house. Lloyd lives right on a main street in a sort of industrial district; next to maybe an auto salvage yard, across from an empty lot, like that. It's part of a group of houses, though, an interconnected project a bit like condos, maybe, and the road by them goes from the street back, past his house, into the complex. I go through his house and speak briefly to him and a woman friend who's with him. [Whatever was going on where I started out, they are part of, or at least they know all about it.] They ask if there's anything for them to do, and I say no, I'm just going on out to get [the car?]. About now, I notice what I'm wearing. It's a sort of baby-doll top and underpants, seems to be blue or black, something dark, but quite short, nearly doesn't reach my thighs, and suddenly I'm very self-conscious. I could do something about it, I guess, ask Lloyd or the other woman if I could change, or something, but I don't want to appear unsure of myself, or scared. So I go on out, wondering if they're thinking I shouldn't be going outside dressed like this. I step onto the sidewalk, take a few steps, stop and think about it some more, get concerned whether Lloyd and the woman can see me dithering through the window, take a few more steps past the window, stop again. Agonize a bit more, then give up and decide to go back. I walk down the drive next to the house, not looking at it so as they won't see me retreating, and pass the house till I come to the end of the building, where there's a carport and then another bit of matching building. At the back of this I turn in between the houses and meet a boy, maybe 10 or 11. He's new here, just hanging out, and I talk to him for a minute. [I find myself explaining to him how these houses are arranged, that this back part is a laundry (very nice, too, completely carpeted and even lounge furniture this end) that's shared by Lloyd and the guy behind him.] (622 words)

I'm in a sort of back alley or somewhere dark and hidden, meeting up with some creatures that I've come here to work with - they are at war or have been attacked/conquered by some people, humans, and I'm helping them. These creatures are animals, little ones mostly, furry mostly, and nice guys. They have their own way of life and everything, they've done nothing to harm anybody, these humans are just bent on taking over and enslaving the little guys because they're little and they think the little guys aren't as good as them. [I don't know for sure if this is another planet but I sort of think it is.] The ones I'm meeting come, quietly, stealthy, and we talk about what to do. (I'm not alone, I think, there's another person with me - it may be Lori.) We go into the building we're next to - it's a sort of warehouse, and there are rows of storage shelving with things on them. It's dark except for occasional lights on the wall, meant as sort of night-lights or security, I guess - the whole place is dim and has a mysterious, suspense-drama look. The enemy is somewhere in here, they're coming this way, looking for the little people they know are in here. We spread out and get ready. Suddenly they're upon us, and a battle starts. Everybody's running around the stacks, people are yelling, it's chaotic, and bit by bit we retreat. [I don't know what kinds of weapons are being used, and I don't know if anyone's killed - don't think so.] The fighting lasts a while, but eventually everybody's out except me and my companion, we're staying behind to see what we can find out - we're going to pretend we're part of this group. They're pleased with themselves, thinking they've won again, and start setting up tables and equipment for a meal, they're going to celebrate. [Gradually the character of this scene changes. The "military" people become people I work with, the warehouse becomes the library, and the meal they're setting up becomes a catered dinner for the staff.] There's a table right in the middle where some people are already sitting, and I wonder if maybe I should sit there, or are they expecting somebody else they know? I hesitate, and don't want to draw too much attention to myself. This looks like the head table and maybe that's where I should be to hear the most, but I might be conspicuous. Then someone suggests that we can both sit together at this other table, the last one in the corner. Good, fine, we go there, sitting at the far end*. There's a lot of conversation, we're all having a pretty good time, but I'm getting hungry, we've been waiting for them to let us know the food's ready. At some point this table's developed walls around it, it's in a side room. Finally we decide it's been long enough, and venture out to see what's going on. By George, everybody else is eating! We'd better get started. First we come to a sort of appetizer bar where a blondish woman is serving dips and crackers. It's pretty depleted. I take a little plate and get a few crackers, dunking some of them into a white dip. Not very exciting, but a start I guess. (The server also looks bored and unaccommodating.) Nearby I can see a salad bar but I want some more substantial food, so I go on around this station (which is backed up to a wall of sorts - the whole place is sort of an open hall with partitions, and I couldn't see past the appetizers) to where there are tables for the rest of the food. But they're taking it away, most of the tables are cleared already! I'm horrified and furious. I go up and ask what the hell they're doing, we haven't eaten yet. This thing's not supposed to be over for another (20 min? 2 hrs? I'm not sure), either, they can't do this. Obviously there's not all that much left, anyway, but still, I'm hungry and I'm not going to sit still for this - I paid $7.95 for this meal and if I have to go out and get my own I damn well want my money back. The servers tell me the guy in charge has just gone down to the (lounge?), I'll have to talk to him. The others (from my table) are not as worked up about this as I am, but Lori and I go after him; I'm working up a fine rage. (705 words)

I work in a store/sales showroom with Harry Anderson - it's a big place, I guess it's full of furniture, big things, high ceilings. It's early, just about time for customers, and I need to change clothes just as people are starting to come in. I take off what I've got on and people look at me funny - including Harry, and I'm rather concerned about that. Harry and I are good friends, maybe even lovers or close to it. I really care what he thinks, and he really cares about me. There may be something wrong here. Maybe they're uncomfortable with me being nude, but it's really not so unusual. I'm somewhat self-conscious, but I won't be out here long - I'm gonna go back in the office/private area and get some clean clothes. I get a T-shirt, but it's got something on it so I pull it off and get another one. I need to go back out for something and wonder if I should go now with just the T-shirt on, or put some pants on first. I'm thinking the customers might be uncomfortable if I didn't. Next: I'm at a sort of resort/retreat place, going to attend a conference of women. We've already arrived, checked in. had orientations, all that. Some of us have been out sightseeing, shopping in the town or something, and we're on our way back (I think we've stopped at a cafe for lunch) and we're late, so we rush back on a sort of train or subway. We get out at the front door of a sort of school/campus hall, and go up some steps, through glass doors and down to the room where the meeting is. There's a guy in a suit and a couple of other people to meet and guide people in. We get there and find seats. We're all at tables across the room, a large room with a setup at the front for the meeting leaders. It's not bright in here, the light is rather night-club-like, grayish. There are some lamps in the front and on the sides (small ones). There's some activity going on but it's not something we're all doing, so we're just waiting at the moment. I'm trying to hear what the people up at the front are saying but it's hard to hear [like it was at Friday's last night] and I keep missing bits. At some point, something stirring or exciting is said and a lot of us stand up, enthusiastic, and I see that some are holding out their arms, and their hands are glowing with energy, a light blue color. I don't know what that's about. These women seem to have something I don't; there are a lot of powerful people here and they're about a powerful purpose, but I don't think I'm in this league... As things calm down I'm lounging in my chair, flopping on the table, and this doesn't seem appropriate, my friend next to me says so, and I agree with her. I straighten up, and for some reason stand on the table... After a bit some of us go out again, or there's a break - as we go out we're walking down the side of the building, there's a passage here and the grounds next to it are pretty, dropping off somewhat with yucca plants and whatnot all green. Down at the end there's a walk to the building - a dorm I guess - where we're staying, we're heading down there. Beyond the building the earth is all torn up, mounds of earth where they're going to build something probably. It's been raining and there are big pools all around. Off to the left, coming around the highest mound, is the other path that would curve up to the building, but the near part is all under water. We've stopped to talk - me and a friend plus 2 others. A woman with red hair and khaki pants and a vest is coming around the bend, and she looks at the water, which I'm thinking is too deep. We call out to her, "You'll have to go back - it's too deep," but she decides she can wade in it, so she steps forward - and promptly slips, falling in up to her shoulders. Yuck. (716 words)

[I'm doing something with a group who may or may not be SCA - we're dressed up, and doing some singular stuff, but I'm not sure it isn't for real.] I've been sent to a house where an SCA revel/council/court is going on. I'm meant to be a hero, here to help them do something. This house is a bit like a brownstone, has steps leading up to a big front door, could've been very grand. I've come alone, and I'm received as an emissary. They seem glad to see me. I've got on masculine clothes, rather Elizabethan I think but hardy. I'm greeted by the leader [I don't know his title - may even be a king] and clapped on the back. We're going in to dinner first, I understand, then we'll confer. I follow them down a hall and outside to a small yard where there is set a long table for a meal. There are already a number of people seated and some serving, and I stop to speak to a few of them, and I'm introduced around. As I come to the other end of the table I start to look where to sit, which I presume should be near my host, but he doesn't seem to be here, so I'm not sure I should sit down yet. Shortly he and the entourage come back in looking for me - we're not eating at this table, there's a room further on we're going to. I get the impression they wouldn't sit with these people - they're like the servants and commoners - and they think it unsuitable that I should have thought we'd be sitting there. (239 words)

I am looking, from a seated position on the floor, around a partition at the legs of a woman. They are beautiful, perfectly formed and flawless. She's standing with her legs apart, and as my eye travels upward, noticing the loveliness as it goes, I see the space right between her legs and even see the little bit of flesh at her genitals that comes down, a small pink protrusion, also flawless, heartbreakingly beautiful. [I'm not noticing hair at all - actually I think she has pubic hair, but it's very fine and light.] I look up further, seeing that her body continues to be lovely, and now I see that she's looking into a mirror - she is actually Julia Roberts (with her hair long again) and she's looking at her breasts. She's just had surgery (I don't know for what, but it was cosmetic) and she's looking carefully at the black stitches, the redness and slight bruising. She touches them very lightly, and the look on her face is concerned, apprehensive, a little fearful, not sure she should be worried - she's been reassured that everything's going to be fine. It's very sweet, really. I feel sympathetic, warm towards her. As I'm looking at her, I slide out a bit around the edge of the mirror so I can see upward at her face better. There's a window not far behind her, curtained with sheers, so there's soft, diffused light (nearly my old green light), and there's a green plant nearby, maybe some flowers. I'm sure the mirror (it's a full-length oval, standing mirror) is in an ornate gold frame. (252 words)

I'm at work in some kind of office - I don't know what we do, but it might have to do with theater. There's a number of people here, at various kinds of desks and tables in an open room with windows. [There's been more before this, and] I've just had some kind of accident away from here, where something glass exploded in my face. It was a kind of safety glass, that didn't all fly everywhere or I would've been all cut up, but very fine pieces or grains did fly out with great force, right in my face. I was a bit stunned for a minute, then decided I'd better take a look at the damage, so I went to (the restroom?) mirror. There aren't any cuts, but my face looks strange, white, brittle, as if there was a thin top layer on it, like a peel-away mask after it dries, but loose. That's scary. I don't know if there are pieces of glass embedded in my face, I don't know what exactly the damage is or what I should do. I think I shouldn't touch it, that might do more harm than good, I'd better call a doctor. I go back to my desk, which faces the windows and most of the people here can't see my face. I talk to 1 or 2 of them, but they don't see anything, or at least don't say anything about how I look. I wonder privately if that means my face doesn't look that unusual to them, but I can still feel it and I'm still worried. (It feels sensitive, brittle, uncomfortable - something's going on for sure.) I start to look up a doctor; then I realize I've got a card in my purse (or somewhere here) that someone gave me for a doctor she recommended. I find it and pull it out, a standard business card. I think about rinsing my face - would that be a good idea, if there's glass in it, shouldn't I be getting it out? But how would I do that, maybe it would aggravate the injury to have water running over it. As an experiment, I reach up and lightly touch a spot on my right cheek, to see how it feels - I brush very gently over the skin a bit, and can't tell anything much, just that it's sensitive and sort of dry, flat-feeling. Then I pick up my hand mirror and look. It doesn't start to bleed, on top anyway, but underneath the skin, capillaries start to open up, bleeding internally. I can see the red blood running in a vein, this way, then that way. As it comes to the end of a vein's route, another route starts right next to it. Oh, dear. Eeek. I get up to find somebody to help, I want to see somebody in particular. I run into Bettye Short and a man, behind a partition which serves as a sort of hallway, where the restrooms are. They're talking, and I don't want to interrupt them, so I wait a few seconds for an opportunity, then ask what they make of my face. [I am not remembering their reply if any - it seems as if they advised me to call a doctor right away. Next, I am wondering how it would be if I immersed my face in water, ever so carefully and slowly, so as not to put any pressure on it; maybe that would give the opportunity for the particles to "float" out. This last, however, may have been after I woke up and was trying to get back to sleep.] (525 words)

I'm just pulling up to a day-care center that's in a large house, in a nice neighborhood, probably Central area. It's got a big double (or triple) driveway and a high brick wall - not too high, maybe 6 feet, but enough I can't see what's going on beyond it. Several vehicles are parked here, and I pull up behind a car on the left, where I can see through the gate. There's a large garage or other outbuilding straight ahead. I see some men (presumed) with hoods on, and guns - 4 of them, I think, and one of them is towing a kid with him, maybe 8, 9, 7? Shorts, brown shoes, striped T-shirt, dark hair. Clearly this is a kidnapping, and I'm about to be right in the middle of it. Looking around as casual as I can be, I back out of the driveway, trying to be ever so quiet. [Notwithstanding that a car always makes the same amount of noise.] They don't notice me. They're very occupied, and I'm being careful not to draw attention to myself. I figure I'd better go call the police. Once on the street again, I see there are a couple of other people - they look like "punks", dressed very colorful, punk-rock cliche, orange Mohawk on one, etc. They're standing further down the street, as if they were lookouts, and in fact they accost another car that's driven down the street and stopped at the Stop sign. They threaten, then start beating on the car with these heavy sticks they're carrying. (They don't have guns.) I pause, wondering what to do next. The guys with the guns will be out soon, I've got to get away. I wonder why the person in the car doesn't just drive off. [I also have the impression that the driver is on the right-hand side of the car.] That's what I figure I'd do. The masked guys come out on the street now, and I poke around in the car as if I've lost something; anything to keep them from thinking I've seen them. So I drive on down the street and avoid the punks, and now I've got to call the cops. I think, maybe I should just drive to a police station - where is one? The only one I can think of is the substation on Northwest Highway - that's too far. Just find a phone. For some reason I'd rather phone from somebody's house, and rather than stop at a pay phone maybe I should go to Dan & Lynn's house - is it closer than mine? No, not really, better go home. (These thoughts are being thunk near the corner of Central & Mockingbird, where the Eckerd and La Madeleine are.) So I get home. I live in a really nice house on a really nice street, west of Central, in the Townships. Green street, lots of tall green trees, thick grass, big bushes. It's not bright sunlight here like it was before, it's overcast, been raining, trees are dripping. (My house is gray brick or stone, with a dark green, low roof - lots of weathering but in excellent condition.) I pull into the driveway and notice something's wrong. My word, there's a whole new house on my lawn! It's smaller than my house, but no little cabin. It faces my house, it's set back next to the sidewalk and a tall bush/tree-thing is near its front door. It looks like stone; not a match for my house (except in color), but a nice fit in terms of style. It looks as if someone meant it to look like a manor house in the woods, out of the Middle Ages. But how could it have been built so fast? It wasn't here yesterday, I've got no idea how it got here. This is ridiculous. I get out of the car, figuring I'll take a look at it, but I hesitate. Those masked kidnappers may have followed me, you know - this whole thing is very suspicious, it could be a trap. I go up to the door very carefully - the door is open, and I'll take a peek inside. There's a mailbox next to the door, I can see now, and there's a white corner of something showing in it. Will this explain something? I can see through the door that there's a pool in the whole visible end of the front room - a sort of landscape affair, I guess you can bathe or relax in it, but I think really it's meant to suggest a sylvan glade with a nice pool, for the look and sound of it. Now that I'm close enough to see, it's not stone at all, or any such thing - it's inflated! This whole house is some sort of portable, temporary structure. How bizarre. But it looks perfect. The "stone"-look isn't like big stones, but more like shale; layered rock, and I feel it, it feels molded. Geez this thing must have been expensive. I take the envelope out of the mailbox - there's a card in it, and it's from Dan, Lynn, Peggy, James, Lloyd, Vince, and several of my friends. This is a present from them! [For my birthday? Not specified.] They all wanted to get together and get me something nice, they knew I'd love this. (Boy they're right!) I'm not going in, though. Not till I talk to the police and check things out - the bad guys could be lurking in there. So I go on in my front door, and wait while Rouse and Tree (who were with me in the car) take their own sweet time getting in the house. Rouse comes in once, then goes back out before I can get Tree to come in. Alleycat (who didn't go with us) waits by the door with me. He's not sure he wants to go out. (962 words)

I'm in some kind of a team race with various "legs" and things you have to do. We're behind. It's close to the end, and we've finished a leg. There's a break while we go see what we're supposed to do at the finish, which is inside something, as if you go down a wide-open hallway, make a turn, and then you're in a big room/auditorium-like, and there's a bit of an audience. It's lit only in places, as if for a show, open and blank between the audience "bleachers", up to a wall. We're supposed to run up to the wall to finish. Back at the last stop, we get back in gear, I think we're running but I'm not sure, and one of us is missing or falters or fucks around or something, so there's no real chance of us winning. We get to the line in the middle of the room, where [I think] we all stop and just one of us runs to the end. But the person who's supposed to do that has bugged out. We (the rest of us) stand around in confusion for a minute while the other team runs on and wins, but I'm real anxious that we should finish and I fervently call out stuff like "But where is he? We've got to finish! Come on!" And get all worked up. I make a sort of false start to run myself, and the others just stand there, having thrown in the towel, it's all over anyway, there's no point, and so on. We stand there looking glum. I'm terribly embarrassed. I know we've lost, but I feel awkward, unfinished, terribly self-conscious. We should finish the race, but now we'd only be drawing a bunch of pity if we did. 
       There's this flamboyant woman (middleaged, lots of dark curly hair, jewellery, rather Gypsy-like but with bread) who's part of the staff who put this on, and she comes forward (she's not the emcee, but does things to draw attention to herself anyway) and offers, flamboyantly of course, to run the last bit for us. But it's all over now, it would just be one more awkward thing, we'd just like to become invisible, even the audience is ill at ease. So she comes off it, and even says, No, I guess that sounds a little patronizing, doesn't it? And she quickly trots off, mumbling something about going to the bathroom. (407 words)

I'm somewhere with my brother and another guy, friend of his, in (perhaps) an office building, we're talking, occasionally I look out the windows and see the place next door. It has some signs on it, it might be a store or something, well known to us. [This is an old-fashioned place, these buildings are maybe from the 30's, 40's, 50's, 2-3 stories, brick.] Just now I seem to think my view of the building next door is moving, sliding sideways. That can't be right. I look away again for a bit, then back, and it still looks different. I look away again and take part in the conversation, but a minute or so later when we look again, the building's gone. We jump up and run to the window, and see that it's being hauled off by a truck. [It's just been hitched up to a cab like a giant trailer, and pulled away as if from a parking space.] I'm amazed, but my brother is very disturbed. He's sure it's being stolen - he runs out, going after it, I guess [or to call the cops], shouting behind him for us not to drive his car. His vintage car is here [something big and bulbous from the 40's, early 50's, he's restored it, it's quite a prize], and he's very touchy about other people handling it, even me and his best friend here. Well, this best friend of his (reminds me of the kid from the Pepsi commercials) is the let's-do-it, impetuous type, and he says, let's go after it in the car. I'm dubious, but likewise I think we should do something, and while I have lots of misgivings about this guy's driving, well, better him than me if anything happens. We take off. (240 words)

I'm in London, stopping over on my way somewhere further east (in Europe), and I've come to visit some friends at this school. It's a trade school or something like that, adult students, I may have gone here myself at one time, I'm quite familiar with it. I get out of the cab from the airport - it costs 20 pounds and change - at the front steps. This school is in a building in town, it's not off by itself anywhere; there are high steps up to it [the building reminds me a bit of A like a resturaunt]. It's quite overcast outside. I go on up and inside. Later, I'm coming out again as school's finishing up for the day. I'm talking to a young man, we'd been having a conversation inside and while I'm waiting for my friends I'm walking out with him. At the corner we get separated; there's quite a crowd of people, and I end up having to wait for the traffic light. I think he'll be waiting at the bus stop across the street, I'll catch up with him. But when I get there he's disappeared altogether. Hmm. Well, that's funny - I'm a little disappointed, he's a nice guy and I was enjoying talking to him. I suppose I'll go back across and wait for my friends. Rather than go back the way I came I cross to the other corner. It's pretty close here, narrow streets, but crowded with people and cars. There's a traffic cop [looks like your typical New York-style cop with a uniform jacket and white gloves] with a whistle and a strap across his chest, directing traffic. There's a little shop on this corner, and the street is blocked off with some road-works going this direction. I cross over again past the cop - since there's no cars coming this way, we don't need to wait for him to let us go. Now I'm talking to a woman on the opposite side of the street about a self-help book (either I have it with me and she sees it, or (this is a little shop) I've picked it up and am thumbing through it, and she remarks on it. She says it's really good, and recommends it highly. I say, thanks, that's good to know (and something about the library - can't remember exactly but may have been, "I can't get everything I want at the library all the time")... (389 words)

We've caught a woman agent and are transporting her back to (Russia? not named but I have a picture of this place being eastern Europe and we're taking her north). (I don't know what my role in this is, but) Sharon Gless seems to be in charge, and she marches this woman around to a truck - it's dark and there are street lights on, or parking-lot lights maybe. Sharon's wearing a trench coat, and has a gun. This truck is a special prisoner truck. One side is clear plastic, or vinyl, flexible, and the back end, too - it makes a kind of see-through cage to transport prisoners in so that people can see they're okay, and who they really are. There are no openings except for the "door" slit, which is underneath a metal frame-thing on the left side. When you do some latches and things it folds down and you can slide through the slit and get inside. We're getting it all set up for the woman to go in. Everybody's calm and purposeful, somewhat grim, businesslike. Not much is being said. Sharon goes in first to check things out, then the woman goes in. (Now there's a blank space, and the next thing I see is) Sharon Gless is sitting in the chair, alone, the truck is moving, travelling through the dark streets; apparently the woman has overcome and outwitted her and escaped, leaving Sharon in her place to be delivered right into the middle of enemy territory. She looks like this is all just dawning on her, very concerned. Credits start to roll over what I see, as though for a movie. Before: "We" (unidentified others) have stopped somewhere on a journey, driving, through some open country in a foreign land. There's a break in what had been mostly trees and hills, to a bit of plain, sandy earth with scattered little trees, very short. Someone tells me why they grow like that, it's very strange, there are these rabbits that live here, and they stay under these trees - I'm not sure if they eat off of them or just take shelter there, but the sun is too hot for them and they scamper from tree to tree. The seeds get on them and then drop off elsewhere so they don't ever grow close together. I find this fascinating, and the plants are quite nice, there are several kinds of little flowers. I take a walk a little way into this, looking at the plants, and I see (and hear) there are also little birds sitting in the scrubby trees. That's cute. I look closely into one and see what I think is a chick, a fluffy little yellow bird. It's just sitting there, I guess it can't fly, and as I look, it moves a few inches to the end of the branch and falls down. It's only a little way to the ground, maybe it's not hurt - I wonder if I should pick it up but decide I'd better let it do whatever it can normally - let nature take its course. (521 words)

Robert Urich is also a gourmet chef, and he's gotten into a bet with a famous-chef friend of his that he can do something just as fast his way as his friend can. They set up a private contest, and Robert wins. All quite friendly, but the friend puts on a little miff. Robert has long hair at the moment, which he is lately wearing in a ponytail. I have been sent to go get something - his trophy? - and go to this building with an outdoor patio or something, next to a bit of parking lot, a level up, maybe head-height, and as I skirt this there's a fluffy white cat and I'm hearing (or singing) "Grizabella". I have the idea this cat is called Grizabella; I think, it's kind of a matter of taste, huh, somebody thought she was a glamour cat. But she is pretty. Inside, I'm looking for something in Lorren's apartment when she comes in - I'm surprised, I thought she was gone and I find myself thinking she thinks I shouldn't be here. Then I go to collect the (trophy?) and Robert Urich comes bustling in to get it himself, and I'm confused, but he's never one to do things the simple way anyhow - he's always like this. Later I'm going somewhere in a neighborhood and I see 2 guys I know, one of whom says something that the other should know, but as I pass him and call out, he doesn't hear me or doesn't respond. Typical of him. Later, I'm talking to someone (who's probably a therapist) - Jill and her roommate have just been here, and their problem is Jill's gotten a job managing a rock band and her being up all hours is bothering her roommate.

I'm in an apartment, fancy place in a high-rise, occupied by an Hispanic gangster and his wife - a tall, gorgeous airhead with big hair and flashy clothes. The place is decorated in mobster chic, but rich. He's not home, and I'm not supposed to be here - she's not supposed to have visitors. She's a nice person, though, and she wants me to be here, I'm telling her something or teaching her something, we're just getting to know each other. Her husband shows up, however, and I have to hide. Eventually I can sneak out. She gets him distracted, and I'm pretty good at this, so I get on back to where I live. Where I live is a sort of group place, an organization. The building has offices and meeting rooms, a lounge, a kitchen, etc. Open, light oak everywhere, glass doors, big windows. I say hi to various people on the way in, and go into a little office-room near the front. While there, I see this black guy (large, tough, in a suit) coming in - total stranger, looking around like he's hunting somebody, and I'm worried. Maybe the gangster's found me out and had me followed here, and I'm in trouble. I lay low till he passes out of sight and go into the lounge where some of my friends are and warn them. While we're standing there talking, suddenly I hear a loud - really loud - "bang" and feel a blow to my head. For a minute everything goes very vague, and I don't know at all what's happened. My head feels as if something's hit the front of it and gone out the back, I have the idea it made a big hole in the back of my head - I can feel the pressure. I'm sure I've been shot. Nobody else seems to have heard anything - they're just the same as they were a minute ago. Maybe I'm dead and they just haven't noticed. I think, if I'm dead maybe I can move out of my body and look at it, that would tell me what's going on. But it doesn't work. I'm still right here, not dead, no bullet holes, and my friends haven't heard anything happen at all... Well, still, we have to go back. Linda and I are gonna go back into the apartment - she's got to measure some curtains. Actually, we've done this before more than once, and I keep on having to hide behind furniture - frankly it's getting harder, too. If this keeps up I'm gonna get caught. But we go, driving in Linda's Mercedes. She parks it in front, under the awning and we get out - there's 3 of us, me, Linda, and another girl, shorter, blonde. I've got something in my hands: left hand, a sort of handbag of Linda's, a sort of green-flowered fabric roll; right hand a folder or papers of some kind. I figure I'd better ditch 'em, they could get in my way. I've only gone a little way toward the front door, so I let them go ahead while I go back to the driver's side of the car. We've left the doors ajar so we can get in fast and make a quick exit if we need to. This makes me nervous in the first place, and now here I am putting something inside that could get stolen. I lean in the back door, thinking to put the handbag under the front seat on the passenger side, but I can see how easy it would be to spot if someone looked. I push it as far forward as I can but boy I'm uncomfortable with it. But nuts, I've got to get on inside and I can't draw any more attention to myself either. Geez. So I get on out of the car, debating whether I should at least shut the doors, but the others are expecting them to be open, and we may really need to hustle. More dilemma. I'm out, I straighten up. I see a man in front of me with a gun. Oops. Not good. I look around. I see plenty of people about, and I figure that's helpful, I'll just back up and mingle, he can't shoot with all these people here. Except that another guy, behind me, an old man in a suit, also pulls a gun and points it at me. I'm taken aback. Then a little girl with pigtails next to him does the same thing. I'm really worried now, and I stand real still for a minute. Until I somehow manage to get away and start running - I run behind the building and climb over fences, getting away through peoples' back yards and around houses. I've been doing this a lot lately, I'm pretty likely to make it. (814 words)

I'm at a big the Festival. The part where I am is near some water, and in between is a long pole stretched between 2 trees, being used to hang clothes on. These belong to several of us girls who work here, it's our costumes and regular clothes too - a lot of them. The pole is really weighted down. I'm going past it to go down towards the water, and I notice and hear the pole slip. It's just wedged against the tree and it's finally given way. It hasn't slipped too far yet, and I try to push it back up but it's just too hard for me. (This is a tree branch maybe 4"-5" around - must be 30' long.) I'm worried it's going to slip all the way, so I figure I'll tell the maintenance man - maybe he can help. He's around here somewhere, an older guy, with a tool belt and all, stereotype. I go on a little way to where there's a kind of shed next to the water and it's for photography. We have a staff photographer and I'm her assistant - which doesn't mean much, just that I have to take over when she's gone. But what they tell me when I get down there is that she is gone - sick, I think, whatever it is it's temporary, but I'm in charge now. This is not good. The fact is I know very little about photography, just learning, and I'm sure I can't handle it. But everybody says, "You'll be fine, there's not that much to do." Oh, boy. I start back up the rise again. I see the maintenance man, he's been talking to the landlady. I hadn't wanted her to know about the pole falling down in case she'd think it was my fault. So I wait till they're apart and I tell him what I saw, come look. As we get up there, though, I see that it has come loose and fallen off. There was a cap of some gold-color metal on the end which was fixed to the tree, and the pole's just come right out of it. [It wasn't like this earlier - just the end of the tree branch wedged tight.] Now he's got to fix the whole thing. I hope he doesn't think it was anything I did. I walk up the hill a bit further, where there's a sort of LT going on - there's the team area setup in back, with something behind it - a rise, a fence of hedges, something. We can sit on some rocks that are here, and hummocks, as well as chairs. Before I get settled, though, I think, "You know, I haven't been down to that area by the front gate that goes off to the right - I'd like to go take a stroll down there and see what's there." I remember how it looks, and that there were some cute things in a shop there before. Also: I'm sewing a button (or something) on a shirt I'm wearing, and at the same time taking a few stitches in my face where I've been cut. [I don't know how that happened.] There's a pretty bad gash a couple of inches long right next to my lip (on the left side? Am I looking in a mirror?) and every so often I'll take a stitch there. When I'm finished I look, and see that the stitches (with that black thread) aren't very visible, and I can smile and open my mouth okay, it just stretches the last stitch a bit. (585 words)

I'm in a friend's house - a fairly big place, she has more than 1 brother or sister (though I can't say how many). I've come here last night late, or early in the morning, I was with somebody else and we got put to bed - I slept in the living room on the couch, there are actually several of us girls here as guests and the place is filling up. I've waked up after everybody else - they wanted to go out early and I stayed, so I've got the place to myself. It looks like morning - yellow light, sun coming through the windows, it has that early-morning feel. I poke around some, looking at the house (a nice but fairly typical suburban house - nice decor, they're pretty well-to-do) and I go into the kitchen, think about breakfast, etc. I also go down the hall - my luggage is in one of the bedrooms somewhere - and suddenly discover my friend's dad is still here in bed. He's rolled over, with the sheet pulled tight around him, and I'm really startled, I thought I was alone and here I am moving around, maybe making noise and waking him up. O dear. I quietly go back to the living room. Shortly the others come bustling back in. They're all bubbly and chatty (like typical teenage girls), and we're making some sort of plans for something else later. The dad gets up and comes out, all dressed. One of the other girls comes in, going on about her car - she has parked it under the house, and now there's no way to get it back out again, she says we have to cut a hole in the floor (this floor - the living room, where we're sitting). I'm sitting facing her, listening to this (there are other conversations going on in the room), and I find it amusing - ha, ha, look what you've gotten yourself into - I say, "Are you crazy?" and go over to get the dad to come and talk to her about this. I explain it to him sarcastically, and he gets pissed at me. He turns and looks at me over his shoulder as he's facing her, a look of big-time disapproval, and says [something to tell me to go away - not mean, but diplomatically forceful, he means it], and I'm crushed. I didn't think I was behaving so badly, and I sure didn't mean to make fun of her - I think maybe he thinks I was making fun of her because she's black (she's the only black person here). I wasn't. And I'm really hurt. I want to get away, and I go down the hall to the girls' bedroom, where there are several beds (including a bunk bed next to the window). I sit down on the bed next to the window, which has a lot of large pillows all over it. I move a couple so I can lay down somewhat, and get sort of wedged next to some of them, but I don't care, I can't be bothered to move them all. Actually, it's quite comfortable this way. I feel a little better. Some of the other girls come in, still talking about what we're supposed to do, and they gather around me, as if to be sympathetic and let me know I'm okay. I'm still feeling isolated, and I appreciate them for being nice. (565 words)

I'm in an old house kind of in the country (we're sleeping over like at Lorren's - she's here, not sure who else). The place belongs to somebody's family. They've moved out, maybe somebody died - it's been a long time and everything was just left here, or some of it anyway; and there's going to be a garage sale or some such thing with the rest. Lorren's here partly to clean things up. There's a lot of bits of furniture, rather a jumble. We're just getting up in the morning, poking around. A guy has come to visit Lorren, she's showing him around, he's English. I am in a position in the living room very like in Lorren's apartment, and I get up and look at this piece of furniture near this corner of the room (where there are 2 doors - one's the front door, don't know about the other - one's open a bit). I think it's a desk, this thing, with a typing stand sitting loose next to it. An old piece, maybe antique. I sort of clamber past it, giving the stand a spray of some wax-cleaner, and since I haven't got a cloth I rub it with my hand - all very casual, sort of by-the-way. As I finish, I say to this other woman who's in the room, "There! If that isn't a hand-rubbed finish, I don't know what is!" Looks kinda nice. I'm curious how it would have been attached to the desk, since it doesn't have an open end. As I look closer, I see that each piece has a little ring-catch toward the bottom (looks like the ring half of a hook-and-eye latch). So I figure you hook them up with some kind of little hardware piece. Looking at the "desk", I realize it has some odd pieces inset into the top. I examine these, and underneath and discover, by George, this isn't a desk, it's a sewing machine! Golly! Upon getting it open, I find there's not actually one in it, but still it's pretty cool - nice little dark wood piece. I remark upon it and say that this is very interesting because actually I have a sewing machine - I'm thinking maybe I'll take this thing home. I wonder how much it would be selling for. I think I want to get out from behind this, and the corner is kind of blocked off - I consider if I can get out the front door, maybe I can go around to the side, but figure that won't work. (I had shut the door.) While I'm here, Lorren comes back into the room with the Englishman - he's all bubbly, making fun comments about decorating the place, and he says here's Lorren all fixed up now to put things to rights, have a look - she's found something in the other room and put it on, but I can't see because I don't have my glasses on. I don't know quite where they are, and hunt around, saying well, hell, where are they? And I find an earpiece, put them on my face, and still can't see - by this time I realize she's got some sort of wings on her back, like fairy wings, but I can't see them clearly. I complain, say, wait, wait, these aren't the right ones (they're my reading glasses) - and I look some more for the right ones, they should be nearby someplace. (582 words)

I'm in a gym or workout studio, at the entrance end where there's some furniture, and along with a few other people, I'm looking up on the wall at a red flag. It's just solid red, on velveteen, looks like, and it's a kind of trophy for my brother (- although he's a little mixed up with My ex). He's just gotten his "belt" in some form of martial art - or similar physical skill - and they give you this to display. (I guess that makes it a red belt.) He's very proud of this, brought us to look at it for a surprise. I'm pleased for him, but not especially excited, and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point to just standing here and looking at a piece of red cloth. I wonder how soon I can get away, without hurting his feelings. Besides, I have to go to the bathroom. There's a class about to start [I think it's a yoga class, and it's unclear whether I'm supposed to be in it or not] and I go past them, trying to be unobtrusive, to the bathroom at the other end of the room. (There are windows down here, letting in some soft midday-light. This is an oldish place, probably in a school. Everything's used-looking.) I go in and push the door to, but it won't latch. It has a standard brass turn-latch on it, and when you press on the door it seems like it goes in, but it doesn't. The toilet is just a little too far away to hold it shut comfortably. This is a problem. I start to sit down anyway, hoping nobody will come into the line of sight of the door (it just stands open maybe 6"-8"), but the whole class is called down to this end of the room for a demonstration. They file past, and I can see their faces. I try to make the door latch again but it doesn't work. (317 words)

I'm at work, sort of - lunch hour or break, I think. The "library" is in some kind of warehouse-y place, a number of things under one roof, including this little shop, or kiosk, really, that sells cutesy decorative things, gewgaws. It's run by a couple of women and mostly staffed by them, very suburban-businesswoman, you know the type, that wear tasteful flowered dresses, they're on the tall side and very well-groomed. And slightly mean. They have a young guy working for them, kind of a stock boy/clerk, and while I'm there I talk to him. The others are somewhere nearby. I'm particularly interested in some miniature kitchen tools they have, they're mostly plastic but I have something in mind that they'd be useful for, and I'll probably buy some. Especially I like the little measuring-spoon set - it's like mine, only different colors (mostly red though). I'm looking for more in the next bin. On the main bin there was a sign that said "$5 for all", and I'm not sure it means $5 for one complete set of these, or $5 apiece (unlikely - they're just cheap little plastic things), or $5 for the entire bin. I believe I'll ask, but as I turn back towards it, the sign's gone, and the boy is putting things away because they're closing up. He's not sure what to tell me, either, but says he can ask the others. I tell him not to bother, and start back for the (library). I am nearby to a back door, the heavy sort with a bar you press down. Becky Crow's just coming in this door with several large cold-drink cups. She's picked them up for her staff - some are drinks, some smoothies, and there's too much of them for her to manage and the door too. I offer to help, taking a couple off her hands, and she asks if I'll take them down to Lisa, who's just coming around the corner at the end of the "hallway". She stops at this cart sort of thing, and I bring her these drinks while Becky gets reorganized. (355 words)

I'm in the kitchen at (Peggy and James' house - although the sink faces the outside wall of the wrong side of the house) with Jenny and also Roger Daltrey, who's wearing a tight white T-shirt and looking very fit. There are other people in the house, we're having some kind of get-together, and I'm helping with the dishes. Jenny's on my left, we've been talking, and Roger comes up behind me. He has a bag of foodstuffs to be put away - leftovers from something, and I take an interest in them as I take them out. There's some soup in a plastic container - he says I should try that, how about he fixes it up for me? (I haven't eaten - haven't been here long.) Oh, yes, that would be great! I remark how good he looks - he's put on some weight, yes, but he's fitter, more developed, and he looks taller - this surprises and amuses him. Jenny's never seen him before, so she doesn't know if he looks taller or not, she's at a loss there. We're having some trouble hearing each other, there's apparently some noise, we have to repeat things and shout, missing a lot of what's said. Roger asks me for something for the soup, I think he said fat, but I'm not sure so I ask him to repeat - he says fat again, and I don't know why, but okay - I ask Jenny if she's seen any and she says try one of those bags in the refrigerator - all the group food's packed up in there. I pull one out and look in, remarking on a couple of things in the top [one of which I've forgotten - it slipped down toward the bottom of the bag]. I say, What? well, what do you know? Look at this, little tiny chocolate-chip - no I mean chocolate - oh, like - chocolate-sandwich cookies! [They look like Oreos, actually] How neat! But no - they're not cookies, I guess - they're marked "Tylenol" and they're in a Tylenol bottle. How weird. Oh, well. [Whatever else is in the bag, I remark on it to Jenny, saying there must have been a LT event, look at all this stuff.] She says it's not hers, actually it belongs to _____, she has a date with him later and he's going to fix her a meal. Oho - so Jenny's seeing a new man. Hmm. Meanwhile there's been no fat turn up, and Roger's gone on cooking without it. He's produced a couple of fried eggs that he's somewhat dubious about (so that's what he wanted the fat for), but I think it's swell of him to be doing this for me. (416 words)

I'm in a large hotel with a group - mostly LT people - and the place is quite crowded, I think we're here unexpectedly too, so we're sort of camping out in a balcony - maybe even with sleeping bags. My bed is next to the balcony edge, and I'm looking out over it with a couple of other women (one of whom is Linda T., I think). The one behind me has something the other wants to see - I'm actually sitting on the ledge with my feet up on it - and the one beside me reaches very awkwardly across me for it, I'm afraid she's going to knock me off. Actually I wouldn't fall all the way down, I guess (this is higher than 1 floor, maybe) - there are other structures at different levels around - but I don't know. Below you can see a large open space, lots of people milling around (it's more like a mall), bright light - up here it's dim, we're getting ready to go to bed. Sandra McLean comes in, she sits near us, and somebody says we should do something, like have a game, and I remember I've got some Mah-Jongg tiles in my bag - I think they came with it, and I've just left them there. I get them out and have a look at them - none of us are particularly interested in that, so I'm going to put them back, when I discover a little pocket in the bag. It's a kind of duffel, colorful, and there's already a zipper pocket at the end of it, but now I see there's another, small pocket, on the top, close to the end, just the right size for little things. I'm quite pleased. About this time a boy comes in, one of our group who's been in an altercation with somebody downstairs. Whatever it was about, I don't know, but I do know this guy sometimes does shoot his mouth off a bit, and apparently he just said the wrong thing to this other guy, who's a bit of a bully, and he shoved him, or maybe even knocked him down, and now he's hurt - sort of banged up around the shoulders, he's carrying them funny and he looks so sad and hurt. I feel terribly sorry for him and want to comfort him, partly because he's so hurt and I know guys often hold that stuff in and it hurts worse when you do that; and partly because when holding on to that pain, you can hold on to your physical pain too, and I want him to have comfort for that. [At first I had him looking like Johnny Depp, and then later he seems to be Tim Matheson and I have this idea that Depp is the bully.] I'm a little shy because I do have a little bit of a crush on him, and I don't want him to think I'm taking advantage - also because I don't know him especially well and he might not want a hug from somebody not close to him. But I go and tell him how sorry I am and make a move to hug him, and he hugs me back. I'm very careful with his shoulders, so as not to hurt him, and I try to let my energy come through and help relax him. He cries a bit and lets his pain show*. (I'm still holding the Mah-Jongg tiles in my left hand.) (561 words)

Next, I'm starting to set up a sort of doll camp (is it for kitties?) next to the house. I live in this brick suburban house with a lot of people - I think of them as family, so there should be a daddy somewhere, but all I know about right now is grown women. One of them, my friend (or sister?) is setting this up with me between the fence and the garage wall. She's pretty much finished hers, but I got delayed and am just starting. We've got these bamboo stakes and some cloth, to make a little pavilion (each) with, and some dolly-furniture. There's other junk piled up around here too. I start to set up my tent/pavilion-thing, copying hers, but don't do it very well. Even as I get it worked out, the light is starting to fade, it's late in the afternoon and I should be putting these things away for the night; I'll start again tomorrow. I'm considering, though, which of these things could be left out overnight - maybe the stakes - but no, a dog might dig them up and take them, or it might rain and they'd be sunk in the mud. So I pull them up. There's a little 3- or 4-shelf rack-thing on the wall, it's wood, maybe it would be ok to leave it and put things on it - maybe not. About this time, here comes a little parade from the back, there's a little fenced yard just off the house's corner, and Marilyn, Linda (or Phyllis?), and Bonnie are bringing some junk in a cart up to the front. Marilyn's pushing it (it's either a wheelbarrow or a grocery cart) and there's something big in the front like a piece of plywood, that blocks visibility. And the whole cart is really crowding the space, I'm afraid she's gonna run over our stuff. I tell her to look out, please be careful, but she's rather oblivious. Linda/Phyllis tells me don't worry, it'll be okay, she's always like this. A little beyond where my stuff is, there's a frame with glass in it (or a mirror) on top of something, and it's broken so that a long, pointed piece of glass is leaning out of it. I'm concerned about it, especially since it makes me think of that part in The Stand where a woman deliberately cuts her throat and sticks a piece of glass in her eye so her head and face would be mutilated. Of course, that was intentional, but this particular piece of glass is about eye level, and I don't want anybody to run into it. I think I can tape it up, but Marilyn's still coming and I don't have time, so I just hold it up, very carefully out of the way as they pass. Then I go back and find some tape - I thought I had that brown tape but all there is, is masking tape - and then I put some on the edges, meaning to cover them all up so I can handle it, then tape the whole piece flat in so it won't stick out. Bonnie tells me I'd better be nice to Nick - he's especially miffed because his "place" has been disturbed. [I don't know if that's something they did - I think he likes to sleep in the garage - or if this little play-camp for kitties is for him. (576 words)

Next, I'm in a public place - maybe a restaurant - and I'm near a window-counter thing where either you order, or you pay. I'm in line (the rest of my group - LT people again - are still elsewhere - at a table?) with some women I'm acquainted with, they're lawyers, all well-groomed, nice looking, nice suits. They know me from the library, or at least a couple of them do, and one is saying, "She's really good, she really knows her stuff" to the others, who nod and look interested. I feel as if they are older than me, mostly because of their professional status and income and grooming, but I know that we're more or less the same ages, I'm just aware that I'm not on that level with them - I wonder how they see me. Something is mentioned about a job they've been trying to fill - one of them even holds up a piece of paper with an example of what they need done, and I can see it's just putting things in order and shelving books. I think they don't know what my regular job is in the Business Office, they just know me as being in the library, and they don't know what else I can do or whether this would be paying enough. I say to particularly one of them, well, it's certainly something I could do, but there are other things we ought to talk about - I wouldn't say no...without seeing what else there might be going on with it and what I could do for you - how about if I come see you and we'll talk? So we fix that up, and just then Lori shows up next to me (there seems to be a kind of cafeteria line to my right), she's just arrived. I haven't seen her in a week or a few, maybe, but my word she looks awful! She's lost a lot of weight, her face looks drawn and pinched, and she's cut her hair short, which is certainly no help. I'm very concerned and ask her what on earth's happened. [There is no reply before I wake up.] (358 words)

I'm sitting in on this high-school class. [I don't remember why I'm here, but it's sort of a matter of circumstances.] They're studying science, parts of the atom and chemistry. It's a room where the teacher is at the bottom and the seats go up like a theater, quite steep. The teacher (actually I think there's more than one) is asking questions and I can answer most of them, that's fun. Then they stop - I guess for a study break - and I go to the opposite side of the room and sit with this male teacher, who's talking to a few of the boys separately to find out if one of them is responsible for something. I'm just waiting for class to be over so we can get on with something. I live in a sort of community house with several other people. I'm trying to work out how this TV (or something) antenna works, trying to get a better picture (or reception?); I pull out the 2 ends till they're even, that's not much help, then the phone rings and a woman wants to know something that I have to go find out about. While I'm talking to her I realize that another fixture has an antenna, it's attached to the column here and pulls out sideways. I just give it a tug and find it's longer than it looks, I didn't think it had that much length to it. But I go off, and I think I know the answer to her question but I get distracted in the bathroom, talking to somebody else. Then she leaves and I'm dawdling. Princess Diana walks in, someone shouts from outside, "Who is keeping this line on hold?" and I have to go. I'm supposed to be in this one bedroom on the left side, center of the house, and I like it best, but there's been a mixup and someone is shuffling people around. This young man has been put in here with me and we've both got beds so we've spent one night in here, but now I'm overhearing the landlady saying she's going to put me somewhere else. That's not fair, I was here first. (355 words)

I'm with a couple of other people, one's a photographer (or even a film producer or director), dressed up in one of those sleeveless jacket things over a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up, etc. We are interviewing former superheroes for something commercial [maybe a movie, not sure] in a loft sort-of-thing, upstairs, lots of space, reminds me of where Images by Aki used to be on Greenville. The prospects are coming one by one, and this lady just now coming up the stairs is next. She's blonde, short hair, nice-looking - wearing a dress with a full skirt, a sort of marble-y black and gold print. It's nice on her, but we wanted to photograph everybody in costume. We say hello to her, say a couple of things or ask a few questions, the usual, and we can see she's very grave, almost sad. We ask her about the costume - she doesn't answer for a while, and we're very concerned. Her face does turn sad and dejected, hopeless. She makes a hopeless gesture and starts to pull down her left shoulder strap, as if to take off the dress. To me it seems this is about her wanting to get out of the superheroes business, but not being able to. For her it's awful, and she's breaking up. I go to her and tell her it's okay, you don't have to do this, and she starts to cry. I hold her - there's a chair here, I sit on it and let her lean back against me and I stroke her hair. She cries some more and gets through it. Eventually she goes off with someone, and the photographer-guy kneels by the chair, and says, "You know, your gift is in your voice - that's where your power comes from, you have the power to heal in your voice." [Or something very close to that.] I'm a little surprised, but it's nice of him to say that. (319 words)

I'm in my house, and there's a bird in here - it's absolutely beautiful, it's a fairly big bird and has peacock feathers, very beautifully designed. (It's not a peacock, it's a flying bird, the body is beige-ish, and the peacock feathers are in different places.) I don't know how it got in here, I suppose it flew in by accident when somebody had the door open. Well, I expect it wants out - I'll go hold the front door open and maybe it'll see. I don't want to startle it, it might just fly around the house and never get out - you know how these things can be. It does move closer to the door (I was a room away a minute ago), and I step very carefully, quietly past it. Now at the door, I see that somebody else is here. [This is no longer clear, but it's definitely one animal that lives here and one that doesn't - I could presume one of my cats, but I'm not sure. And the other is not a cat, for sure, but not necessarily any particular other animal - it has characteristics of a lamb, but I think it's a combination of animals. Basically it's small, cute, and innocent-looking.] I'm concerned that they'll get out if I just leave the door open for the bird - a pretty silly situation. (165 words)

I think I'm in England, on a sort of "field" trip with a group of friends - we're sort of camping out in a nearly-empty storefront that I think is being used as an antiques warehouse. We have sleeping bags and all, scattered around on the floor. There may be 8 or 10 of us, including Johanna. We're sort of lounging around, there's no particular plans, and some of us go out for a walk. There's a fair number of people about, it's a nice friendly place, and cute little shops up and down the street. A little further down there's a sort of square, with flowers and seats, where people sit. As we stroll along that way, I pass by a guy who doesn't look nice at all - scruffy, sinister, dirty - and he says something to me (he's also black) - I don't want to encourage him, so I just nod or something and go on. He gets up and follows. I walk a little faster, but he's still there. [He sticks with me for a bit, but I do some clever maneuver that loses him, which I've forgotten now.] So I carry on back to the storefront in a hurry. We're having a good time, sitting around joking. Somebody comes up with what's left of a bag of bagel chips and passes it around. Johanna and I leap on it, we're hungry. I get one, pass it, then grab it back and get another, Johanna does too. It's evening, the light is dimming. A man comes along to take us somewhere. He has a "flivver" - it's really quite neat, a black horse and buggy, the spidery kind with a folding top, and this one has a sort of high rumble seat. He (the man) talks to our leader, who gets us all organized and our luggage gathered, and we pile in. I get put in the rumble seat, and I'm really doubtful about this - it's really high, and bouncy, I can see right over the canvas top of the carriage and it's precarious up here. But they tell me I'll be fine (there's someone else up here too). We go off. It's a nice ride, off out of town through some lovely green woods and little hills. It's night now, all quiet and rich and exotic-seeming. We arrive at the man's house. It's a farm or an estate, I guess - big place. We stop at what I guess is a barn or carriage-house and get out. His daughter comes to greet us, she's maybe 14, long dark hair, pretty. Some of us go off to the house with her. While I'm still here looking at something, the man's son comes by the side of the building, leading a pony on a rope. The pony is being frisky, and the boy is getting pulled along now. There's a big mud patch right at the corner, and - whoops! pony slips and goes down, right over, legs up, and of course the boy gets pulled right down too, on his face. His dad laughs, so do we. I notice it's daylight, and I'm amazed. [There's a scene fragment about getting ready to go home, and I'm aware that in another dream I was talking about, and intending to practice, lucid dreaming.] (509 words)

I'm in a (place like a movie theater) with friends, and I have to go to the bathroom - it's around a wall and down a corridor. There's 1 or 2 people in here to start with, and I find the catch on the door has to be just-so before it will hold. [Somehow the scene changes, and there are 2-3 other girls in here with me - the space is wider and the wall doesn't go all the way across - it's open on the right. Around the wall it's an office - Andrea H. is at a desk with someone else, and she's telling me she has an assignment for me when I get through. I duck back around the wall; now I'm wondering how I can pee with all these people around. [I do something, which results in a puddle of pee that I need to pick up and dump out, and I get my feet and legs splashed - it's not a whole lot, but I'm annoyed. Some even got on my skirt. I go over to Andrea - we walk outside while she tells me something (it's either about what I'm to do when I'm gone from here, or while she's gone somewhere). We stop by a short open bookcase with various things on it, including a shoe - it has no mate, and I pick it up out of idle curiosity. She says it was left by one of the branch managers. [I'm thinking a black one.] It's black fabric, high-heeled, and actually open down the front, with scalloped edges. It's big too, and I put it on for the fun of it, considering I've got on flats and this will make me quite off-balance. It sure is big - it's almost big enough that my foot would fall straight out of the opening on top. I find this very amusing - I expect Andrea to remark on it, but she doesn't, and so I call to a friend nearby and show her. (There are several people about, doing things.) Now I need to go, and I walk around to the front of the house where my car is, and I stop and say hello to the cats, especially Alleycat, who I haven't seen for a while - they're perched up on a very low roof or wall where the driveway stops. I get in my car [or somebody's anyway] and drive a little way down the street - it's a very nice street with tall green trees, a roof of leaves, sunlight showing through. [There's some reason I have to turn around - I pull into a driveway, back out, and go the other way. I have trouble adjusting the mirror, and I'm afraid I'm going to hit a man or his car with the outside mirror on mine - it's quite large. But it turns out okay. (282 words)

I'm in a school, we're doing a LT, it's the afternoon break. Most of the trainees are here, but most of the team is gone, and the trainers aren't here but a couple of guys in suits who belong to the school are. This is a regular classroom, with windows, and somebody's seen smoke. I look around and find a very odd thing outside a window: there's a desk, with a chair, everything as if it were in an office, right outside one window, behind a hedge, and on it is a can or something with smoke coming out, just pouring out in a funnel (as if it started from a little spot and was flowing fast). It may not be an actual fire yet, but it's unattended and looks dangerous to me. I go and tell the guys about it (the ones in the suits), concerned whether we should put out an alarm. They don't think it's such a big deal, and I say to the group, well then I'll go see what I should do about it - I should have time, it's a quarter till and the Training doesn't resume till 6 o'clock, right? Somebody says no, it's starting at 5.50. O dear. Well, then, I'll stay till then and I can do something. However, we've been hearing noises from another part of the school for a bit - and now I can see flames from a part of the building we can see through our windows, and people are shouting "Fire!" at a distance. We'd better do something. (262 words)

I'm at Peggy and James' house (at least it's supposed to be, but doesn't look like the real one). I've just stopped in here around noon, lunch-hour, to visit for a while but nobody's here. (It's a sort of homey place, white, black trim, probably 30's or 40's, modest, a front porch with a corner and 2 doors.) I go to check the mail - there's a long mailbox [like their real one only longer], and I fumble somewhat getting the mail out - I pull it away from the wall. It's been stuck up there with double-sided tape, which I've twisted somewhat and I'm afraid I don't get it back on very well, but it looks ok, sort of. While I'm here on the porch I see that there are 4 people - kids, looking a little hoodlum-ish (at least one's got a black leather jacket on), one's a girl with long blonde hair, one guy has black "greaser"-style hair, etc. - hanging around near the yard, on bicycles. It's all open here, no fences, and the house faces a corner of a wide business street - plenty of visibility, but not many people about. They're looking at the house, and now I see they have guns, actually pointed this way. I am very disturbed, but I think the thing to do is casually go to the car and lock myself in. I think I'll be safer there. (It's my mom's car, I think, and the house has also become hers now.) I get into the back seat and start locking the doors, but they're too fast for me - one jumps into the front passenger seat and leans over, pointing his gun at me, grinning. I freeze up. One or 2 have gone into the house too, and I'm suddenly horrified I've left it open - somebody holds up a bundle of money that was somewhere, I'm mortified that I've let them steal from my own mother. They all get in the car and one says we're going on a little trip, you just sit back and take it easy (or something like that). All very standard cop-show hoodlum stuff. [Next scene:] We're in a police station - all of them are here, and a policeman (detective? plain clothes, I think) and my mother are here. They're talking, and from what I can gather they meant to give themselves up. Maybe all along, I don't understand if this whole thing was some sort of ruse or not. I'm still terrified, pulled in on myself, won't say anything, in shock. I look from one to the other and don't quite believe what I hear. I want to cry but I can't. My mom says something. I get up and go out of the room (did somebody suggest it?), through a bit of corridor to a waiting room where there's a couch, chair, end table, lamp, etc. Finally I break down and sob hysterically, falling to my knees and huddling over the chair. I think somebody comes to comfort me, I think it's my mom. (508 words)

I'm in the diner across from the library eating a "Veggie-Burger" with some other people. They all get finished and go, but there's one woman still here, and she says, "How can you eat that? Whenever I eat any kind of meat I just get sick", and I'm really startled. I thought this was a veggie/soy patty of some sort, and I scrape the melted cheese off (rather a lot, a white cheese with bits of peppers and other veg in it) and examine the patty closely - by George it looks like hamburger - thin, but hamburger - and I pull it apart with my fingers to see if it feels like meat. It does. I take it up to the counter. The woman there isn't the regular person but I show her and complain, "How can you do this? This is hamburger! What a rotten thing to do!" She's somewhat taken aback but doesn't say anything. In the back of my mind I've been thinking they must have thought they could call it "Veggie-Burger" if they just put vegetable things on top.

I'm with a bunch of people somewhere out of the country, maybe England, I figure we're doing a LT, and we're staying in this place that's old and large, with lots of rooms. We've sort of bunked where we could, girls here, boys there, and most of our luggage (or at least where my clothes are) is in this big long room rather like an attic, with various wood roof supports, trunks, hanging-racks, old furniture, the odd cobweb, dust. My friend and I are going back here to collect our stuff so we can pack, it's time to go home, and I'm filled with thoughts about travelling, planes and such. As I'm picking things up I realize that they're pretty scattered around, as if in our coming and going we'd been pretty casual, hanging things here and there, setting things down in different places, and I'll have to collect them. But somehow the racks and things look emptier than I expected, and now others of us are coming in, bustling around. They're not packing up right now, just my girlfriend and I, and frankly they're in the way, particularly the guys. I'm moving from place to place looking and I have to keep dodging people. Now I come to the conclusion the stuff is just not here. How can that be? I'm quite confused. (224 words)

I'm in England, visiting I think - or maybe I'm supposed to get married. I've been visiting with some people and a man came - he's somebody we knew and like, but he's rather shy and retiring. Lives in the country, and I'm supposed to go visit him. He has to leave right away, and I'll follow on my motor scooter shortly. He tells me where he lives and how to get there - when I get to the town he'll meet me. He leaves, and I finish up, say goodbye to my friends, and putter off. Rouse is with me, and it's quite a challenge to hold on to her and drive. We leave the city and drive through suburbs, buildings getting smaller and farther apart, more and more green trees and grass. It's very pretty here - the road becomes a lane, winding through tall trees, little hills. It gets to be harder to hold Rouse - she's getting restless. part of me is observing, and wonders if I don't have any more luggage than this (there's a small bag somewhere on the scooter). I think of ways I could be carrying more, like a knapsack or a carrier. I begin to be concerned about how to get where I'm going. I think I stay on this road until I come to the town, but he mentioned 3 towns and I seem to have forgotten which one is the right one. I've been relying on my memory - nothing written down - and that's probably a mistake, now I'm having doubts. We keep on until we come to a place that has some people milling around - some event is going on - and I figure I can go and ask for some help. It turns out to be a dog show, or trials, and these people are rather upper-class, with expensive outdoors-y clothes, a woman wearing jodhpurs, all that. Having dogs around is also pretty tricky with Rouse here. (Part of me wonders why I don't have a carrier for her, and also, how can she be with me instead of in quarantine? - actually that's a little later, after I've left again.) The woman wants to help out but isn't really sure how, since she doesn't know the man I'm going to see and I don't have much information. The men (2 or 3 of them) aren't interested, and wander off. My brother (who's younger than me here) is in a side room of the house, a sort of den/workroom, he's sitting on a couch and a couple of other guys are sitting nearby, one perched on a desk - he's older than my brother, sort of a mentor, and they're having a sort of heart-to-heart talk, very emotional for my brother, he's working through something. I come in and sit down next to him, just becoming aware of what's going on. I feel an empathy for him - I really am fond of him, though we're not usually affectionate - and put my hand up to pat his neck. I rub my hand on the back of his head - he's got a buzz cut, it's real short - and lean over close to him. He puts his arm around me and we hug. I'm pleased to be able to offer him support. I'm supposed to be getting married - I've got on a wedding dress and there are a number of people about, all dressed nice. We're outdoors, at a place where you travel from - either a marina or an airport. There's a plane or boat here, that I'm going to go away on, and I'm up on its top or hull, and it's in sunlight. Most of the others are in shade under the canopy/roof. I'm climbing across the hull - there are clusters of ribbons with streamers decorating the top, in a row, sort of, and I'm collecting some of them. There are big bows, firmly attached, I'm leaving those, they're meant to stay, but I'm picking up smaller ones, that are just stuck down with Scotch tape. (687 words)

I wake up and go through the bedroom door into the living room - I realize that someone has broken in and stolen everything. Even the bookcase is gone, the one on the right. I'm stunned - I can't believe it's happened, even while I was here and didn't hear anything at all, I'm scared and feel violated, I've been so stupid to think I was safe, and it's happened again. Gradually I realize I'm still in bed - I don't think I could have gone from there to here and not remembered it, I must be dreaming the robbery. That's quite a relief. I feel a whole lot better. I wish I wouldn't dream about break-ins so often. I get up and go into the living room again, just like I did before, and I see that the bookcase is still there just like it should be [it's not like my real one, it's plain wood with closed sides] - except it's been pulled away from the wall somewhat - it's at an angle. That's weird. I look around and see that everything's here, but I realize the only way for the bookcase to have been moved is for somebody to have moved it. It wasn't me, so that means somebody's been in here. Somebody must have broken in after all - maybe something's been taken and I haven't noticed yet. Oh dear. Now I'm getting nervous. (226 words)

I'm with a bunch of girls at a house, it's something like a birthday party, we're all talking and laughing. I go outside and over to the landing where I'm to get on a boat with a man (my boss? father? boyfriend?) and a couple of other people, but I've been delayed and they're already pushing off. They're too far off for me to jump on and can't come back now, but I figure I can just step over to the dinghy and get on from that. He and they are waving and shouting to be careful, I'll tip it over, but I think I can do it. It's harder though, because I'm wearing high heels (black pumps). I do manage to get into the thing, just on the side, making it lean over so the far side is in the air, but I wait and it stabilizes. Then I take another step to the center, but that's too much and it goes right over. Just in time I jump back onto the edge of the landing. (177 words)

I live with my family - we're not the classiest bunch, generally blue-collar, dark curly hair, Dad eats dinner in a T-shirt, etc. I'm in my room doing something, dinner's ready and Mom calls me but I don't care. There's a shower curtain across a bathtub on one side of the room, and there's something large that protrudes from it - maybe something I made, I think I'm an artist - but it's clumsy and not particularly good, ignorable. I'm working at a desk or table on the far side of the room, and my dad yells at me to get up and come to dinner anyway. I bitch and moan but I get up and see that the "thing" has been changed. Now it looks like a big penis, and not a nice clean pink one either. I'm disgusted and outraged. It has to have been my brother that did this. I'm gonna get him for it too. I stomp out to the table and announce that "somebody" has been screwing around in my room, telling my parents "You go look at it - just look at what he's done" - meaning my brother, of course, glaring at him. He laughs and I get madder. I go over and grab him, lifting him up and sinking my teeth into his arm, and I fling him back and forth as hard as I can. I'm fed up with this crap, I'm leaving. I'm gonna walk right out of here and never come back. I pick up my black leather jacket and stalk out. (263 words)

James has got some records and a toy piano for a woman who's coming to visit - an old friend or co-worker. He's very anxious that it should be a surprise, but she shows up (she's tall, good-looking and sophisticated) suddenly and the stuff is out in the open. I spring into action, grab the piano and duck down the hall to the "girls'" room, think about sticking it in the bathtub behind the curtain but put it in the closet. I run into Connie and (?) and try to get them to grab the other stuff but they don't in time, so I go get the records, hoping my dashing around isn't too obvious. She doesn't say anything about it, anyway. Later, I'm on my way to work downtown (I think I'm in a car right now) and I'm going to turn right toward downtown on a street in near Deep Ellum. There's a car in the right lane that I would be pulling in front of to make the turn, but I can see the potholes in that part of the block are very bad, so I stay in the middle lane to clear them before I pull over and turn. I hope the other driver doesn't think nasty things about me. I have to make a stop before I get to work - a police station where I'm dropping in on a detective who's working on a case (embezzlement or something like that) involving a woman who looks like me. He was trying to pin it on me at first, but he knows better now, although he wishes he could just get it solved even if it turns out that it was me. We have a pretty casual relationship, and I'm just checking in with him to see how he's coming along, if he needs me for anything. I see him at a desk in a sort of dark anteroom - there are a number of other inquiring, waiting-in-line types around, but I chat with him while he's doing paperwork. He says they've located her but she eluded them - something about being under something at the bottom of a boat. I wave bye-bye when we're done, he always tells me they may be calling me again, and I go on to work. I'm on a kind of tricycle (or a funny bicycle) - it's black, and I have some trouble getting up a good speed on it. I try standing up and pumping the pedals but it's hard to keep my feet on them. I wish I'd brought my regular bike. I don't want to get there after dark - it's late afternoon now, I'm going into the sunset. (453 words)

I've just come home - we live in this shabby house on a big street, on the corner and there's nothing on the right side of it (as you're facing the house) but a busy street, some empty lots, and maybe a shopping center or a main drag. I've never actually stayed here - we've moved in just recently and I've been away for some reason. They've given me this front room that has a big window on the side and a smaller one on the front, and the only curtains are tired-looking white sheers. The overhead light's very bright, and I find when I start to change clothes that I can't do it practically anywhere in the room - with the sheers you can see the whole room, and there's plenty of traffic outside - I'm really self-conscious. I've already pulled off my top and I'm holding it against me, and don't know what else to do. I really resent this - those slobs of parents of mine shouldn't have done this to me, they just don't care. (My parents are Bonnie and a slovenly, hairy guy in an undershirt.) I try to think of something I can do but can't think of anything. 
       There are cats here, Tree in particular but also others I don't know well and haven't been here long. One's just died suddenly, it was quite a surprise. Now another one is playing around, sort of jumping up on its hind legs in front of Tree, and gets hit in the head by the ceiling fan. Poor thing - I'm sorry, but I'm really bamboozled now. This is too weird. Later, as I'm looking for something to put over the windows (I think) I'm poking outside and start to take a box, but I look in it first, quickly realizing that's the box we put the dead cat in; I just glance in briefly and move away.

Making drinks for Ted's group at Oak Lawn Library while there's an adult librarians' meeting going on. I have no great aptitude for it but I do all right. After a great deal of setting up and getting organized, I get a round of drinks off and go elsewhere for a while. OL never looked like this - downtown, office-building front, big conference room, outdoor swimming pool, retail store (J'Ann Alvarado's running it today). I go outside - it's a pretty sleazy end of town, and as I turn left and walk a bit I see across the street a guy is holding another guy up off the ground and threatening him. I keep my eyes averted, studiously, but also keep a lookout as I walk. Shortly I decide this isn't what I want to do and turn back. There's another couple of black guys on the street now, and I aim to avoid them. I have to walk right into the street to do this, pretending I meant to do this. They keep maneuvering as though they're going to stand in my way but I get around them and back into the library. It's occurred to me that they might be wanting second drinks, and I've just walked off - after all, I am supposed to be the bartender. But I check in and nobody's called for anything - as a matter of fact the drink-stand has been mostly cleared off, the extra bottles are gone. There's a catering or custodial staff cleaning up their meal, and I hadn't meant for them to do mine as well, but as long as they're doing it, how nice! I mean to ask somebody a question, to ask if Ted's left or how I can find out if I'm done here, but the speaker's still going on at the adult librarians' meeting, and Barbara from the parking booth is in here sitting down - she's not feeling well again, looks awful. I chat for a bit, and actually my back has begun to hurt and is getting worse - lots worse. I complain of it and somebody sympathizes, asks what happened, I say I got it from sitting on my little squashy couch. One of the librarians I know, sitting on the back row, says Daniel here should give me a talk on how to take care of your back. I say I've heard it, thank you, plenty of it, I couldn't stand any more. I'm squatting right now to relieve it, and get up saying I'm gonna go do my back exercises. I'm due at my own branch after this (which is an overtime gig) and I've got to do something about this. Later, I'm retyping the draft of something I'm writing for work - I've made some revisions (with input from Ted) and I'm anxious to get it finished. I type for a while, and get up to do something. Linda takes over, and I realize she doesn't know about an insertion/revision I've made between where I left off and a separate section. I go back and check what she's done and I was right, she just went on typing even though I'd left off with a comma, she didn't even notice. I point out to her that I want this revision in here, she says o dear, I'm sorry. I take over again. Later I take a phone call when I get home - it's dusk. It's a phone company trying to sell me phone service. I tell her I'm satisfied with what I've got, only person here, there are no teenagers here, no, no, no, thank you. (609 words)

The next-door back yard has huge exotic lettuces growing in a garden - all they have to do is take off a leaf or a part of one to have salad material for a week, and the whole plant's beautiful. I think I'll plant those next year, I'll get her to help me. I'm trying on sweaters in the store where Abby works, but (either there's no dressing room or I don't want to use it - I seem to be in a hurry). She's not thrilled with the idea and we have to keep a lookout for her bosses. I get stuck trying to pull my blouse off over my head and have to unbutton it, which is not fun because the buttonholes are tight. I'm also trying to change or pull off sweaters on the front lawn where you cross over to the next yard, though it's not flat here, there's rocks or an upgrade and bushes, so we're somewhat hidden - I'm talking about how even though I like to wear sweaters in the winter (Abby asked me why I was wanting all these), I certainly know to layer so I can pull some off when I'm too hot. There's a TV family here, getting ready to go somewhere, all wearing coats on the front sidewalk. I notice the stripe trim on the teenage daughter's coat, and think, "You know, they must give her that same coat from wardrobe for consistency." (244 words)

I'm in a hotel sitting on a couch, waiting to meet someone. It's a young woman who wants me (and someone else - a friend, I think) to house-sit for her for a few days. She and a companion come along, we shake hands and trade polite greetings, discuss arrangements, and go on to the house. It's a big place, she's/they've got a lot of money, but it's old, the house is full of antiques and frankly is stuffed full of eccentric things and is somewhat messy. Going on through to her bedroom, we find a similar jumble (by the way, the ceilings are very high), and there are 3 very large framed "things" on the wall. They're not pictures, but more like fabric, light colored things. My friend and I figure they need to be moved - they're liable to fall down anyway. We actually start to lift one off the wall and the woman says [something that indicates we should be leaving them alone, so we quickly put it back]. (158 words)

I'm at an apartment house, I seem to be moving into a new apartment on the left side of the building upstairs, with Rouse, and a couple of people are helping me out. One of them, a young woman in pants, is going to sit with her for a while downstairs, and I tell her to be very careful, hold on to her tight outside. We go down and around the corner (someone else - another woman - is with us) to a place at the back of the building that's an entrance to [I guess] another apartment. It's a sort of low bubble-thing in a pool with little low bushes and plants around it. It's locked, and the girl with Rouse can't open it. I have keys that the [person whose apartment it is?] gave me, 2 keys on a ring, and I step over to open the "door", but fumble with them and drop them through the bush into the pool. Now somebody's going to have to fish for them... Back upstairs, I'm just getting started with what I'm doing when there's a commotion outside, someone's calling for Rouse, and I know she's got loose after all. Oh, hell - I told her to be careful. I go to the door and open it, and there's Mousie, she dashes right in. Wow. Well, okay, that's great. I step out and shut the door, leaning over the open railing to call downstairs that Rouse is in, and behind me I hear someone say, oh, good, that's a relief, etc. I turn and see a black couple - he's wearing a military uniform - and it seems they've been pressed into service to find Rouse. Shortly other people line up behind them until the stairs are crowded and I can't get down. Next: I'm in a theater in the balcony, just getting to my seat, it looks a lot like the Majestic used to. The Christmas Revels is about to start. There's a woman here, nice-looking, well-groomed, she's a kind of usher but more. A woman onstage sings a song, a really nice bouncy song - she has long blonde hair, wears a conservative ladylike knee-length dress - and after she sings some verses, and we're singing the chorus, she invites the audience to sing verses they know. (I didn't hear her do this, but various people start to sing, including a couple from our section of the balcony.) I think this is why the woman/usher is here, to be a kind of secondary ringmaster and encourage us to join in. A lady across from me offers a comment, she turns out to be English, and I wonder if there are a lot of English people here. I'm on the aisle, and I've set my purse down on the floor next to me. A couple of black women come down close to me - apparently they're looking for their seats, but rather than go any further they sit down on the aisle steps, close to my purse, which I'm not comfortable with. The usher-lady comes over to tell them they can't sit there, they have to go to their seats. [By the way, I'm very excited and thrilled to be here, fairly buzzing inside.] (523 words)

I'm in my apartment [similar to this one] - there's a new guy moving in next door, he seems to be rather well off and sophisticated. Dapper-looking; I've been watching him through the window. I'm moving around, doing various chores, and I'm at the right front window, which has blinds on it, but they're partly open, so I can see part of the deck. As I take a look through, I see a man's face looking back at me. I'm shocked, terrified. When I find my voice, I shout, "Go away!" at him, and it comes out strangled. I shout it again, several times. In the back of my mind I'm observing that he doesn't look dangerous - he may have been just crashing out there and not planning to do anything harmful. [I'm not sure what time it is - it's either early morning or twilight, the light's like that.] But still I'm completely thrown, grasping for control, trying to shout loud but can't do it. I yell I'm gonna call 911, and even get the phone, holding it up where he can see. He looks concerned - like this is a disturbing wrinkle. He gets up and moves out of sight. I've punched the numbers, and I hear a voice, but I realize I'm hearing a recording. At the same time I'm moving over toward the door and I see it's unlocked, which is horrifying - how on earth did that happen? The door opens and he comes in. I'm still shouting as loud as I can, which sounds weak and tight and unsatisfying to my ears. I'm still hearing nothing on the phone. He moves toward me and I hit him with something I've picked up. I hit him again and again, he was surprised, and now he's got his arms out defending himself. I put the one thing down and hit him with the phone too. He sits on the floor and slumps over - I think he's unconscious. I go to the window on the side, hoping to call for the man next door. He's right there next to his car [which seems to be upstairs, right next to the window], he's maybe polishing something. He's dressed in a tan suit with a tie - just middleaged, intelligent face, wavy hair. He listens calmly with interest while I choke out my call for help, and he comes around. I'm still near complete hysteria. And still in the back of my mind I'm aware this guy may not have meant any harm - the only hostile thing he's done is come through the door uninvited. But I'm just not able to get back under control. The man comes, and somehow Jenny's there, too (and another woman friend, who's doing something to help but I'm not paying any attention) - maybe he called her, I don't know. I must have said something to her about being sorry I couldn't shout louder, choking up, I feel so helpless, but she says, "That was really pretty good... I bet you shouted half your moons out that time" (or words to that effect). She's referring to astrological moons, the implication being that I've stored/pent up a lot of emotional energy in my moons that needed to be discharged, and this has given me a chance to release some of it. I just barely understand her. I figure I'll ask her to talk about it more later when things are back to normal. (551 words)

I'm going back to where I'm staying, along a freeway that's got businesses built up right next to it all the way down. There's no traffic. Nobody's around at all. I was driving, but now I'm walking along a sort of mall that follows the road, on the left side, and I'm stopping in a kind of delicatessen or bakery. The proprietor is a heavyset, swarthy man with a mustache, very friendly, we've been talking a bit and I'm eating a cookie. I'm in England, actually [or somewhere] and it's my last day. I'm on my way back to the house I'm staying in, having visited with some other people I know. Suddenly I feel terribly guilty when I realize I've spent hardly any time with them (the people I'm staying with), I've been off doing other things and we haven't even gotten to know each other. They must think I'm a terrible mooch. I start to leave. I've noticed a brown paper bag on the counter with a bit of grease stain on it - I thought a previous customer must have left it, and now that I'm leaving the man stops me to take it, he thinks it's mine. I tell him it isn't, etc., and he says take it anyway, your bonus, I'd only have to throw it out. I take it and set it on the counter to look in it, saying, maybe so, but it looks like there's a 6-pack of beer here, and I don't drink beer. But I pull the top things out and it's actually (what's left of) a 6-pack of Dr Pepper (little bottles). Then another couple cans of soft drink, and leftovers of something else, some food. Big deal. I don't know, I don't want it either. I'm arriving at a place next to where my group meeting will be - a very strange place, various levels of concrete, but a business, a number of people congregating, a young people's hangout. I park my car on the far side of a spot where you can maybe get 3 cars in, but there may not be room for Jenny's car, she's coming in right after me. I check my wheels and they're right on the edge. The other car is too far over, though. I consider moving mine so that the wheels are right over these brackets along the edge, but decide I can't do it by driving. Maybe I can push it another inch though, and even though the other car is a big heavy clunker, maybe we can all shove it against the wall and Jenny can get in... Upstairs, I meet up with some girls I know, some of whom are in our group, we're chatting. A couple of them are in their underwear. One asks me if she can use my dress for a while, and at first I say yes, and start unbuttoning it. It's a light-blue sort of flimsy cotton dress with a white collar and cuffs, and when I get it unbuttoned (I've moved away from the balcony rail to the back of the hallway, aiming for the ladies' room) I ask her, don't you have something I can put on while you have my dress? And how long will you be? I've got a group meeting in a few minutes. She acts as though I'm being selfish but doesn't give any direct answers, and I'm feeling very exposed. I don't want to stand around in my underwear - even though they are, I'm fatter than them and will be embarrassed. A group of guys we know come along and gather round, just verging on making fun. One of them is Bruce. [Kids are so cruel to each other - a thought I just had as I'm writing this.] I decide I'm not gonna give her my dress and start to button it back up. (632 words)

I've just gotten married to this wonderful guy who lives in a (little?) suburban house (a sort of 50's-VA-ranch-style). He's got light brown hair, tallish, handsome, friendly, and very sweet. I've only just moved in and still feel very tentative, disoriented. The house has this one big room that he uses as a club on Saturday nights, all the young people come and dance. [We're talking about 20-35 really, age-wise.] We've been getting everything ready, actually he's been running around doing things and I've pitched in where I could. There's also a friend of his - a girl, old friend from school or the neighborhood - helping out, she's very nice, helped me feel welcome. Now people are arriving, quite a lot of them, and there's a lot to do, taking their coats, getting drinks, etc.At some point I've gone to the bathroom, and the door latch wouldn't catch, so I just have to hope nobody walks in. It's a long bathroom with some sort of partition in it, and a worktable. The girlfriend is sitting at it, and my husband apparently starts to come in, because she starts talking to him rather loudly, in such a way as to keep him outside the room, for my benefit. I'm not enjoying all this bustle a lot, and I go off into another part of the house to get away for a while. It's all very new, this place, this town, living with this man, being married - I haven't know him long, we just fell for each other like a ton of bricks and I wanted to be with him so much I'd do anything. Now I'm wondering if I can get used to it, if I fit in. Do I even want to be married? I go across the street and visit with some older neighbors, still feeling confused. After a bit, people start pouring out of the house - first a clump, then a clump, then a stream. They seem to be excited about something, all talking and hurrying. I can't see or hear what's going on so I go out front, and I hear bits of sentences, about fire, and my husband's name. Some of them see me and stop talking, but I also hear, "(he's) dead" [I don't know his name] a time or two. I'm dumbfounded. I look at the house, expecting to see flames burst out of the windows, but all there is, is a big plume of white smoke coming from one area of the house. Thoughts go through my head about how ironic it is to be only just married and now not be again, will everything just go back to normal? But I have to know what's happened - I rush into the house, stumbling through rooms, past overturned furniture, till I come to where he is, and he's alive - there are firemen around, they've got the fire out and a lot of things are wet, including my husband. He looks exhausted, and he's very cold, he's done something heroic that saved the day but now he's all wet and suffering somewhat from shock. The girlfriend has a trench coat over his shoulders that she's trying to keep around him, but it's wet too. When I see him I scream and rush to him - suddenly my doubts are all gone, I know I want to be with him whatever it takes, I love him so much. I pull the coat off of him [and either he's naked, or I get his other clothes off him] and hold him tight, wrapping myself around him tight to give him my body heat. He says something about the fire, how apparently it burned up this little wooden thing he'd bought for me, how ironic that was - we'd been talking about it earlier, we'd seen it in a shop or at a craft fair and I'd loved it - a little box of 2 exotic woods, how unusual it was, and it cost $275. That's very expensive, and of course we said we couldn't afford it, but he'd gotten it for me anyway on the sly. I look around to see what happened to it, but I don't spot it, even though I see some other little nice wood things. (695 words)

I'm in England with some girls - not close friends, but we're travelling together, and we've set up a weekend on a boat up in Scotland before we go home. We all meet in the office of the agent who's setting it up, and she has a little dog (like a Cocker Spaniel) that's one of those nervous, flighty types that try to be friendly and cute but might bite, and I'm scared of her. We have a while to wait, so we sit around the lounge/living room and I try to stay away from the dog. Part of the time there's this huge yacht or boat maneuvering in its slip (which is now where we are, partly inside the room) and some of the machinery swings around and nearly hits me in the head so I have to duck. I'm not at all sure I'm going to like this. But we go. We drive to the location where the boat is, and this road used to be harder to negotiate - now it's been literally divided, there's a wall between lanes so that you can't get on the wrong road - just for a certain stretch, not all the way... We arrive, and there are some others on this outing with us, including Dan & Lynn and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's a sort of guide. We know each other a bit, and spend some time talking, and I'm saying at one point that even though he's done a lot of travelling around the world, I may have done almost as much, even if most of it's been to England - after all, this is my 6th time here. We're hugging close together while we're talking and I'm resting my head on his chest. The others are doing various setting-up chores, and shortly I turn and look at Dan, who's gotten some sort of stinging plant attached to his foot, and he's having to get it off very carefully. It's a sort of clinging water cactus. (335 words)

I'm in London, just arrived - I'm looking for Geoffrey's apartment, he lives here on some kind of business assignment and I'm going to stay with him. It's a funny kind of place, with apartments going off at odd angles. Here's his, and I'm let in. There are others here, visitors, maybe at least one is a roommate, I don't know. They're all very sociable. Geoffrey is somewhat distracted, he's got something on his mind - I'm quite welcome and he's glad to see me, but he can't give me all his attention, so I poke about on my own. There's a television, and I'd like to turn it on (and maybe I do) - I'd like to be like a little kid, just sit on a cushion and watch cartoons, while the grownups do stuff; but maybe that would look pretty dumb on my first day in London - I should be out sightseeing or something. My glasses are filthy. A girl who's sitting on the couch shows me some glasses cleaner she's just been using - there are a lot of things on the coffee table in front of her, and I'm dubious about using Kleenex on my glasses, but then I figure, what the hell, they're so scratched up now, who would care? So I clean my glasses, and one or two other things as well, including the desk. When I've done that, [either she remarks on it or I notice with horror] that the spots are now a lot worse - in fact it looks like the cleaner has been eating away at the finish! There are a lot of bleached-looking spots in the middle. O dear, Geoffrey's not going to be pleased. I stare for a minute, then dash into the kitchen to find some wood polish. Geoffrey's standing next to the sink talking to another girl, and I grab the bottle of Pledge or something that's standing on the counter. I go back and polish the desk with it. Now what I see is these aren't spots on the finish at all, they're inlays or some design. As the polish restores the shine, the design becomes clear. (This is light wood on dark wood, like mahogany.) It's probably a Greek or Roman scene, somebody in a toga, animals maybe - I can't see the whole thing yet. I am a bit confused - I don't think this was visible before; does Geoffrey know about it? Will he like it when he does? Very odd, this visit, so far. (414 words)

I'm at a big lecture given by this well-known motivational-self-help guy. I'm helping out for a bit here, listening to him when I can. There are a lot of people here, including a lot of LT people. He sounds pretty good, I'm liking what he says, and his manner. There's this girl - one of his regular staff or helpers - who's been part of the crew I'm with, and suddenly she's getting out of hand, dancing around and flouncing her hair (which is reddish-brown, long and shaggy), she's wearing orange tight pants and a midriff top, no shoes, and now she gets really loud, flouncing by me, asking, "Have you ever heard of the Barefoot Lesbian?" And I have no idea what's going on. Meanwhile, the lecturer starts getting more excited and energetic about something, and he's talking about somebody he's calling evil, and starts pounding his palm and raving. I'm thinking, well, this guy sure ain't Brad & Roy after all. (163 words)

I'm performing - more or less - in a small concert hall/club, it's got regular rows of seats but it's attached to a larger place, entered from a space that's probably a restaurant, regular nightclub, or hotel. In the back of the room there's a small counter with a cash register, and an abbreviated stage in the front. Rolly is going to play piano for the singer, who's black and resembles Catherine [from Preston Royal] (or Oprah Winfrey). She's got on a slinky spangled black dress with long sleeves. I'm in the back of the room; I'm part of the performance [but I don't know what it is I'm doing. Vocal accompaniment? An instrument?] It's almost time for the show to start, and there's some hostility between me and her. It comes down to something she said about my mother, and she thinks I'm prejudiced and I think she's prejudiced. I tell her I won't [do my bit] until she apologizes, and she says she won't sing if I don't. We're still standing there glaring at each other across the room when the crew comes in, and they're in a very good mood, they're playing catch with overgrown vegetables. The stage manager tosses something to me, and I toss it to someone else after a brief pause - I'm confused about the switch in attitudes. Then he brings this gigantic green pepper, that I can't even catch - I have to roll it to somebody, over to the right, and I move toward the right aisle. Then comes a wad of something that I think was spaghetti wrapped in a foil bag, long and rectangular, but it's come loose, and when I catch it I can't lift it up again and toss it, I just fling it but it doesn't go very far. I tell the next guy - a stage hand or somebody - to hold on a second, and I pick it up and wad it back together tighter so I can really throw it. But we have to stop because the audience is coming in and taking their seats. The singer has been just standing there, still pissed off, but now she's walked off. Rolly's been sitting at the piano (in a tux) the whole time, wondering what we're gonna do, and I have the thought that he expects me to handle this. I'm more or less twiddling my thumbs, knowing something's got to be done, but I don't know what. We can't just keep standing here. (401 words)

The apartment is nearly empty - are we moving in or out or what? There've been some others here but I'm alone at the moment, and I can see out the front window an old woman's getting out of her car with a gift package. I don't want to see her - she's a nuisance. I'm not dressed, either, and I grab a robe and try to get myself covered up in case I'm discovered, and when I see she really is making for the stairs I fumble into the back and try to hide under something. Apparently she goes away, though, and my friends come in. We talk about the plants. I still want to know if I can plant the poinsettias, and I think (Mike?) might know, but he's not sure himself. I notice somebody's moved the hanging baskets. Why? Very strange. (144 words)

I'm living in a place that used to be a store, and trying to rearrange the furniture. I don't have much, and the place is really bare, but the floor isn't flat - there are steps all the way across the room, starting about a third of the way across. The wall on that side is a plate glass window. So I can't put any furniture on that side of the room, and it's discouraging. At first I think there's only the one room, and I won't be able to get my bed in here, but then I think, well, there's the other room, maybe I can make that the bedroom and this can be the living room. I'll see about that. I'm in a little store right before Christmas, it's dark outside, after work, and the store is dim and nearly empty. There are a few other customers poking around, and we're also trying to solve a puzzle for a contest the store owner has every year - a little thing, you solve the puzzle, blow a little whistle to announce that you did it, and you get a little Christmas trinket. I solve it and go look for the whistle but it's not there. I call out to the owner, "Are we supposed to just tell you when we've solved the puzzle, or what?" - he says, yes, that's fine, I'll go get your prize. There's a couple in the store who are really pissed. They think I cheated, and they're grousing to themselves. The owner brings out a bag and empties it out on a counter. I can't tell what it is yet, but it looks very nice, like it came from Neiman's - I figure it's probably something else; but it turns out (the owner says) that it actually is the prize. Oh, boy. Sandie has come by with a friend, and given me a Christmas card she's made from old bits of antique cards. I think it's really nice. There's a part on the front that's incomplete - it used to be a puzzle where you'd take the pieces off and there was another picture underneath. I tell her that it's really swell, she could actually market this. Actually I'm not sure if this is my card from her, or she's just showing me what she'd made. (392 words)

I'm assisting at a "race" event in which Tree is running. There's a man - a trainer, I guess, who's in charge, and he's giving me instructions to do a "bleeding" - Tree is not in the best shape and needs a lot of tweaking to have a chance of winning. He's old and has been racing a long time - a real trouper. What I'm supposed to do is cut a short slit in his left front leg and then stop the bleeding. Actually in this sort of "garage", near the track, there are lots of Threes up on racks, and I'm supposed to do this to all of them. I'm very hesitant. I do a couple, but I really don't like it. Even though it's a normal thing to do - given that it's just a practice meant to win races or get a slow runner to go faster, I hate to think I'll hurt him, especially if I slip or do it wrong. I go back to the boss and tell him he'll have to do it himself, I can't finish. (184 words)

I'm just going to the bathroom, I've got a skirt on and I've pulled my pants down, when I hear somebody coming up the steps. I think it must be James, so I leave my pants on the floor and go toward the front door. Before I can get there, it opens - I didn't leave it unlocked, it must have been picked. I yell, Who are you? What do you want? - that sort of thing. He looks at me like I'm a petty annoyance. He looks around like he's deciding what to take or something, and his only response to me is sneering, like, "Go ahead and scream - nobody will hear you." But I do scream, knowing that if Tom hears downstairs he'll come out, and maybe others. I manage to get outside and dash down the steps, screaming, help, help, robber, or something. There are some people about, and it takes a few seconds, but they start to pay attention. The man comes out, startled apparently, and makes as if to run away. I start calling out description - he has light brown curly hair, a hat, baggy brown jacket, etc. He looks confused but still trying to be arrogant, makes some threats like, I'll be back, don't you worry. There's a little crowd gathered now, and they look like they'll be all over him if he tries anything. I'm very grateful but still angry. [He goes off in a vehicle, and apparently I chase him, because I encounter him somewhere later, but that part's gone.] (239 words)

I'm delivering a car to a man - something he's just bought, a Lincoln Town Car, very nice. I park it and go down the street to find him - he turns out to be an old guy, he's buying the car for nostalgia - it turns out to be an old one, too, but very nicely restored, in excellent condition. I think he's black, tall, friendly, maybe wearing overalls. I show him the car and he drives off. I'm with another girl who drove another car and we start back for it but I look into a shop first - it's got outdoor gear in it - we're on a sort of mall, outdoors but the shops face on a courtyard of bricks. I've got something from the shop just outside the doors, a quilt or something, like I'm trying it on, when it's time to go on for sure so I leave it on the bench. We go further, there's a group now, and we're looking at this office facade for the Honda headquarters. It's quite a large building, and in the center is a fancy door with panels next to it, all heavy wood, impressive. We're curious, so one of us goes up and opens the door and steps through. Then says, "What a joke! There's nothing over here at all, it's just a door to nothing!" See, the door isn't set in part of the building, as if multiple stories, it's just somewhat more than door-high, maybe 1 story, and then sky. But you can't see there's no roof. And there's a space nearby, a break in the wall, and the one who went through the door steps through that, showing it's just a facade. We all find this curious and funny, so we go through and find a big stadium-like space between office buildings. Hum. To the right we look into a place and find a church, a service going on (Catholic?). We sit down in the balcony and watch for a while, like an audience. I have a candy bar and I keep eating it. Somebody glares at me, and I feel sort of half-guilty, realizing that it's not really usual to be just watching a church service without taking part in it, and I try to pay attention for a while. But we go on, and eventually I'm with just one girl going back to my car; we pass by a lot of cheerleaders practicing on all sides of this "mall"-thing. Very strange, it's getting dark now and the stores are closing up, but here's these groups of 'em every so often, and for some reason spaced out so they sort of ring the place. Hum. Passing by the outdoors-shop again, I see they've closed up and left the "quilt" still on the bench. O dear. I'd like to do something about it, but there doesn't seem anything to do. We go on to the car./We're going to Jenny's house for a meeting. I can see her and her mother rearranging furniture in a little room to accommodate about 8 of us, they set up 2 couches across from each other./I see Jenny in bed with another woman, kissing - I'm surprised, I didn't know Jenny was bisexual./I see another room, full of tables and chairs (in Jenny's house?) and I remark to my friend, "Will you look at this furniture? Look at the legs - they're all alike." All the chairs and tables - it's a sort of parlor, with antiques and chintz, you know the type - have got Queen Anne legs [I didn't use the term till I was writing this], bowed out at the top, in at the bottom, with a foot. Interesting image. I wonder how it happened. (621 words)

I seem to be having a romance with Rolly. I'm moving in with him, into this nice suburban house, and it's quite an ordeal, bringing my stuff over in bits and pieces. I feel very awkward about it. Rolly was here but he's gone on to work, and there's a couple of others here helping me, and then we're going somewhere together. One helper is Dan, and he's being quick and efficient but I'm slow. We get out the door and they go on to the street, but I stop at the mailbox - it's huge, with many sections like a brochure rack or something, and there's a lot of mail or something, and there's a lot of mail in it. I thumb through it, thinking maybe there's some for me - earlier at my apartment there was no mail and I was surprised - now I don't see how there could be mail for me here yet, but lo and behold, here's something for Tom Jenner delivered here by mistake, maybe my mail's here after all! There's a section for Trisha here - for some reason Rolly lets her have mail sent here when she's travelling, or between places or something. There's a lot of mail here, and the others are impatient, so I leave it and go on. We haven't gotten but a little way when the other guy mentions leaving the burner on under the teakettle. Says when Rolly gets home it might have developed into a fire or something, maybe we should turn it off. Dan says, nah, never mind, all it'll do is burn the bottom off, it's not worth going back for. So we go a few more steps, but I get nervous about it and dash back. While I'm there (this awkward, uncomfortable feeling is growing) I look around and notice how "ordinary" this house is - all neat and well-appointed (it's nicer than Lloyd's house, but likewise has no soul), but I don't want to have to give my place up for this. I observe that I haven't even given notice to the landlord yet, and here I'm moving in - if that doesn't show how reluctant I am, I don't know what does. I'm not as fond of Rolly as all that; I guess I've acted hastily again - I don't want to do this. I make up my mind to go back. I feel better. Still, we've got somewhere to go, me, Dan, and this other guy - I go on out to our vehicle (a van or bus?), and we get on the road. Somewhere at a distance we're stopped, with a large number of other vehicles part way to our destination. It's something like a traffic jam but we're gathered around something, like a kind of building, I guess, and people are milling around, driving motorcycles around, jogging, standing talking in the sun. I've got on rollerblades or something, and I'm very awkward, trying to keep out of people's way. Our other friend takes off around the circuit (on a motorcycle?) (in his underpants? - he's rather stout) and I follow him...I'm riding or driving back to where I'm staying in another town - I'm here on a special trip of some kind, a working trip, and I go somewhere during the day - working, I guess. I can see the skyline in the sunset, and I've just noticed it for real - it's certainly different from home, and I get very homesick, not suddenly, really, I've been feeling sad for a while, not realizing what it was. I wish I could go home now. The branch is remodelling, and they've set up our office cubicles - very colorful, blues and yellows - rather enclosed, with doors. At the other end of the space is a section with some soft carpet and lounge-y furniture, rather juvenile. It's unfinished, but sure looks like a children's play area. I remark on this to (Wayne Gray?), who sheepishly says, well yes, we figured it was the best place for it - out of the way and all. They won't be making that much noise, not all the time anyway... I'm very doubtful. Even if the noise isn't bad, just knowing there's nowhere you can go without being out in public is a nuisance. (722 words)

I'm with a group of people who are unrelated but living together as a family. I'm visiting, or I've stopped here on my way somewhere. The weather is getting windy and cloudy, and I'm looking out the window. In the distance I see a fast-moving, whirling black cloud showing behind other clouds, and I think it's a tornado. I call out to the others, and some come look. A man tells me, "That's probably not a tornado - sometimes we get these, they don't touch down." As it moves, I can see that it's up in the air, very big, very black, but no funnel tip. But as I watch suddenly I see there are things flying up in the air toward it - there are little pavilion tents, cows, pigs, wagons, stuff that belongs at a medieval fair. Huh? [Apparently going outside,] I see that a little way off from the house is indeed a fair, but it's kind of mixed up. I'm not sure if I'm seeing a medieval fair, or a Dickens-y or an Alice in Wonderland theme park. Fun, though. (Is this where I was going in the first place?) (191 words)

I'm at work, sort of - haven't started yet, and I'm gonna go around to the cafeteria and get some coffee (this is a very big place - the cafeteria has a full staff and everything). There isn't any made, but the guy behind the counter gives me some orange juice. I taste it but don't want it, I'll make some coffee. I'm still a little groggy, though - I pour the coffee grounds into my orange juice. O dear. I look around nonchalantly to see if anybody's looking, and walk casually out. Nobody notices. I decide to go to the doctor that I heard about from some patrons. He's not far away, I'll just pop in while it's still early. I park my car next to the building, it's just a dirt parking lot with trees around, as if it was out in the country, though it's not. The building is old, converted from something. I go in through an unused room into a little waiting room, very homey, old couches, magazines strewn everywhere. There's several other people there, housewives by the look of them, with one or two kids among 'em. I sit on a couch and start to look at this comic or illustrated book I've brought with me - it's Batman or something. The doctor comes out and calls somebody in - he looks nice, shortish, plumpish, smiling, pleasant face. I eventually realize I haven't told anybody I was coming here and it's almost time to start work. I'd better go on back. Frustrating. I go on out to the street. It's several lanes and fast traffic, how am I going to get across? I wait a while and then realize I left my car in the parking lot back there. Good grief, what a dork. Better turn around.

I'm at a TV studio with a small package that I'm supposed to give to Billy Connolly and the actress who plays his wife on the TV show "Billy". It's white and not wrapped up as usual, but in 2 pieces, and none too neatly. It contains some odd, "found"-looking, old things. I don't know where to find them, and as soon as I step into the building I start seeing people I know - mostly from LT, but not all. I stop and chat from time to time. As I'm talking to someone else, I get squeezed around the neck by someone just coming by, and I lean back and see it's Annarae. I hug back and say hi. (She's wearing a peach sweater, and I seem to think she's got some trouble - we don't talk about it, but I feel sympathetic. I let these people go on and I start back for some offices I passed back a while ago. I have to stop for a minute and squat down to fix my shoe or something, and a weight bears down on my back, driving me to the floor. It's a man - I don't know him but I know who he is, and this is his idea of some sort of joke greeting. A couple of other people come up - they tell me who he is - and say to him how stupid he is, get off her. He doesn't, and I gather my energy and roll over with him, heaving him sideways and flinging him to the floor. I tell him if he doesn't get off I'll roll up like a hedgehog and fling him all over the hallway. Finally he does and I thank the others and go on. By this time I'm thoroughly frazzled. I find a reception desk and a girl there tells me where I can find the actors' manager (or agent or maybe the director, I forget). I go that way and find his office, which is very small and has some wall shelves with books and knickknacks on. I look at a couple while I explain my business and he looks at the package. He says he'll see it gets there for me, I thank him and go. (380 words)

I'm babysitting or some such for a well-to-do family in (some place like South Africa, at the bottom of a continent a long way from home). The folks have come home, and someone else is here to babysit, the person I was sitting in for. The mother, a middleaged, very prim, stuffy woman, sends me on a trip to the grocery store. It's a pretty fair piece, but easy enough to find, straight down the road, turn (left?) and then you come to the (village?). I set out walking, and Linda is going to come after me shortly on a bicycle. The road is black dirt, quite rutted, through open fields. Connie comes along too, and before long we have to dodge some riders on horseback coming up the road, joyriding, all togged out in habits. They're not exactly polite, blundering through, it's up to us to get out of the way on the side of the road. Way down at the end are some houses, and they're quite nice, though not large and mansion-like, like the house I'm visiting. There are lots of trees here, tropical-looking ones, making it seem quite dark, and it is approaching twilight. I'm thinking the road dead-ends and we'll have to go through people's yards if we go anywhere from here, but by George the road does turn (we go right) and continues to a sort of country general store. Inside there's a youngish guy who's also (the local preacher? schoolteacher?) - you give him your order and he packs it up. We're getting some meat, and there's some question of whether we want the good stuff or the not-so-good stuff. [I can't distinguish whether it's the family getting the first-quality and buying seconds for visitors and servants, or the shopkeeper gets all the good stuff for himself. Now I think it's the former.] I have to go to the bathroom, and I go around to it, a very simple place this is, white clapboard, plain countrified, white inside, like an old schoolroom. He comes in while I'm on the toilet, to get something, but he doesn't look, though I'm thinking this is a tacky and manipulative thing to do. He leaves, and someone (a man, but not necessarily the shopkeeper) just peeks in the door briefly right after. I'm having trouble getting started urinating because of all this. [Woke up here, actually needing to pee.] (362 words)

I'm at the downtown library, visiting, looking around at some of my old haunts [it looks nothing like the real thing]. I greet a few people, notice how some things have changed. I run into Gail , and she's showing me some piece of equipment or furniture, and we're talking generally. (It's night, or getting there, not many people about, there's a subdued, quiet atmosphere.) We get to talking about animals, she says somebody we both know has a certain kind of pet, and I'm surprised. She says, oh yeah, and somebody else has this one, and somebody else has that one, etc. - but I don't know why I should tell you all this, you can read it yourself if you want to. She gives me a printout list from a drawer in this cabinet-thing we're looking at. Apparently this was made up for some charity project. I take it and put it in my purse to look at later. We continue talking, and she gives me another list or document, which is definitely not for general circulation. She says, "You know I never gave you this...", and I agree. A bit later, after I'm off on my own again, I'm squatting down by a cabinet and my purse is behind me. Both papers are in it, and I knock it over, and the one about pets falls out. Just then Marsha comes by, and she sees the paper. I say hi, picking up my purse and the paper, trying to make sure the other one isn't visible, without letting her see I'm hiding something. She does see the pets one, though, and takes it. (I think she asks for it and I hand it to her.) She turns away for a minute, and I stick the other one into the cabinet, thinking I'll retrieve it later. But Marsha's very serious when she turns back - she asks where I got this, and I tell her, wondering why she's so disturbed. But she tells me I can get into a lot of trouble for this, asks why I took it, I tell her we were just talking about pets, no big deal, what's the problem? She says this is private information. She thinks for a bit, says probably they'll have me buy pets for the children. I tell her I still don't understand what the problem is, and she opens the printout to show me the title - it says "Mi Panin" something something (the printout is all caps, of course) - it means nothing to me at all. At first I thought the word was "panic" but I can see it's not. I am still mystified by this whole thing - part of me is concerned that I shouldn't get caught with the other paper, I'd really be canned for that, I am really worried. But the pets one - I keep expecting I can just explain about that, but Marsha is really adamant. (490 words)

I'm arriving at my grandparents' house on Vanderbilt - they're out, and I want to use their house for something, though I'm terrified they'll come home while I'm still here. (I haven't seen them or most of the rest of my family in years.) It's still just as it was, and frankly I'm surprised. You'd think they'd have remodelled a bit. I look around downstairs, going into the kitchen from the dining room, and on through, suddenly realizing I haven't seen a microwave - I'm looking for one, because I want to use it - surely they've gotten a microwave, wouldn't somebody at least have given them one by now? I go back through, looking carefully, going from the dining room into the room where the sink is - noticing I'd forgotten that the part where the stove, etc., is has no sink - you have to wash dishes in a separate room. Funny. [Note this is inaccurate from the real house; it's as if you'd put a wall in the real kitchen (and moved the refrigerator), but it was never like that.] But no microwave. Oh, well. I go toward the bathroom, and just as I'm crossing the den, the bathroom door opens and a naked girl starts to come out. She has a towel or something and covers herself up somewhat, very startled, and retreats inside the door. I ask who she is and she says she's a reporter or something, works for the newspaper (?), she's sorry, she was just taking a bath, didn't know anybody would be here, etc. - I notice she doesn't tell me exactly what she's supposed to be doing here. I'm a little afraid, because especially I don't know if she's alone. I start thinking about calling the police, and I try to see inside the bathroom beyond her, though she's holding the door as if to prevent it. I explain who I am, but she doesn't know I barely have a right to be here either, and I hope she doesn't ask. I have a bit of an upper hand but I'm worried that there's something potentially dangerous here, and I'm more and more suspicious that there's a man with her - which would make the situation worse. I jostle the door and make more of an effort to look in, and by George there is a man in there! He's naked, and just in the tub - I see him reflected in the bathroom mirror, trying to keep quiet and out of sight. I'll bet she notices me looking and figures I've seen. My apprehension escalates - I'm gonna go call the cops. I go through to the dining room where the phone is, hoping I can make the call before they come after me. I get the number dialled, and I hear sounds while it's ringing, and just as someone picks it up (I think - I'm not positive because I have one ear listening to the sounds at the door) the doorbell rings. I debate whether to answer it or make the call, and in frustration put the phone down. I answer the door, and it's a whole raft of people, some of whom I recognize, all dressed up in their Sunday-go-to-meetin' clothes. Apparently there's been a wedding or some similar celebration, and the reception/party's being held here. Oh swell. I'm greeted warmly, like I belong here - some of these people are distant relatives, and they're all on a kind of churchy-Sunday high. There are black people here too, and I talk to one woman in a springy flowery dress and hat, with her daughter, similarly dressed - I wonder if I should tell them what's been going on, or are these people somehow dangerous too? Maybe I should just sneak out. I'm feeling confused and frustrated. (611 words)

I'm at home - I live with my family - and I'm late for work, I suddenly discover - got about 15 min. and I'm confused. I start to move fast, thinking about my hair, and get deodorant on, then realize I need a shower and shampoo. Damn. I hope I can get by with perfume. This is terrible. I keep looking out the window at the bus stop as if I could run down and catch it if it was in sight. (No way.) In the bathroom, the little cabinet has been moved forward of where it's supposed to be, next to the toilet, against the shelf - I make some snotty remark about slovenly people - the place is a mess anyway, stuff all over the counter, including the boxes of curlers my mom uses. I've got 2 of them in my hair, actually, last night having hoped they would help. I push the cabinet back where it should be, and start to pull the curlers out, wondering what I should do first.

I live in a big busy apartment complex. My front door is at the top of a long steep ramp. I decide to go out for something, and as I get to the ground I realize I've left the door open. Uh-oh, the cats'll get out! I turn and look, and by George, there's Rouse on the ramp all right; I shoo her back up and she goes, but there's Alleycat down next to a tree. I call to him - he ducks around some, and I move as if to chase him, but I realize the door's still open. I'd better go on up. There's a guy speaking to me, he wants to ask me something or tell me something, I guess, and I tell him I've got to go in - he says he'll help me get my cat, I say no thanks, and he follows me up - inside the door I say again, I'll just wait, Alleycat will come in on his own, and, lo and behold, just as I turn to the door, there he is. I shut the door behind him. [This guy is somebody I know - and in real life he's somebody well known, like a TV personality, but I don't know him personally.] Later, I'm out in the complex on my way wherever I was going, and I'm walking along under the upstairs walkway. It's started to rain, and up ahead at the end of the walkway I see this heavy gush of dirty water come over the edge. I assume it's a torrential overflow, and don't want to get caught in it, so I wait. After a minute I realize that things haven't changed much up there, you can still see the dark water hanging over the edge - but that's silly, what's wrong here? I look closer, realizing it isn't making a sound any more either. It's stationary. Coming out past it - the rain had after all stopped - I can see - oh my word, it's a dog! This huge English sheepdog that lives upstairs is trying to escape from a bath - he's covered with muddy water and sort of wrapped up in a big brown plastic trash bag or something, and he's tried to jump over the edge and got caught, so he's just hanging there. He's trying to wriggle loose, and does, and hits the ground in a loud wet-bag sploosh. Not far in front of me, and he's wiggling and wagging his huge tail around to get out of the plastic. I get smacked with the tail - in the bag - just before he gets free, but I think I can try to help get him stopped before he runs off, and his owner comes up and is grabbing for him too. VK & I have been at a woman's house on some errand - he needed to make some arrangements with her about a project she's doing with, or for, the library, and I came to help. That having been settled, we're on our way back in our mobile office cubicles. This thing is like 2 little desk-cubicles (like the downtown library has), one behind the other, opening to the left. I step into mine and sit down, then VK gets into his and he starts it up and we drive away like a motor scooter or something - he has a steering wheel. I need to ask him a question, and I step out, not thinking at first that it may go too fast for me to keep up with, but realizing quickly that if I just keep a lively step going, I can stay on a level with VK - I go ahead and check with him [on whatever it was I wanted to know].

I live with John Cleese and his wife - they're not my parents but my guardians, and I help them out in the business. We make something and sell it. I've just come in from outside, and there's a guy over by one of the machines trying to get a sample of some stuff, and he's going away leaving the spigot dripping from the ceiling (way up above). I'm looking at it, trying to figure out what to do next - I stick my finger in it to taste it, and it's going faster now, turning into a stream. John Cleese arrives, horrified, saying we've got to fix it - he's talking quietly so as not to disturb the customers or appear upset, but he's pissed. He mutters "cream" as he's turning to go fix it, and I call out - "Uh, it's caramel" after him (the stuff is a stream of caramel rather like the cajeta sauce at A fast food chain). I don't think he hears me... In another room, which is huge like a gym and has some equipment in it, I'm watching John up on a high wire on a bicycle - he's got one of those long poles. He's going to work on some sort of machinery and this is the only way to get to it. (222 words)

I'm in some kind of storeroom or lower-level workroom, cinderblock walls, high ceiling, various things stacked in different places, a work-table or desk, maybe a file cabinet or something. I have come in here with a man for some legitimate reason, we work together (more or less - the relationship is not close). But now he's attacked me - another person has come in and they're talking about raping me, but something has to be done first - they're waiting for somebody else. They're very threatening, taunting, mean. Shortly the second one goes out and returns almost immediately with several more men - all of them looking tough and mean, like gangsters. They're engaged in some activity [though I can't identify it - not just a conversation, and while they're quite visible I just can't say what they're doing - the first guy is definitely the boss though, and they look to him rather than paying attention to me - my understanding is that they're all going to rape me] - but for the moment nobody is looking at me, and I see the door's been left open. I'm close enough to it that I can get out without going in front of any of them, so I seize the opportunity and slip out quick, then run as quiet as I can - I make it to the elevator just in time, I don't even know if they're chasing me yet, I just assume they are. I go up to the first floor and get out, running out the door, aiming more or less toward home, across the field. I'm not sure exactly where I'm going, though I think briefly about calling the police and where I can do that. In my path, however, I see the [train] where Rita is at the moment - that'll do it, I'll get her to help. Nobody's in sight chasing me at the moment, so I go around to the door and go in. Rita's there, and we talk. She says I should join her, and we'll go see somebody. After a while the train moves on, and we arrive soon at a place with a house and lots of trees where the owner lives and has invited us to dinner. Very friendly, I'm honored. [The previous incident might have been forgotten, or it's metamorphosed into this one.] It's twilight now, through the trees - a lovely place. I'm a policeman or security cop, rather new, working with my buddies, who I think include Lynn & Peggy, in this little rustic-looking office in a small town or neighborhood. It's night, and not much to do, and we're messing around having fun. Somebody sees the guy who's bringing our paychecks coming down the street, and we quickly dash back in, giggling and joking - I suggest we all sit down on our benches very straight and upright, with straight faces, all in neat rows, so he'll think we're real serious. (We're all rookies, by the way.) We just barely make it, and I'm fumbling to turn on the tape player for the soothing music just as he comes in the door. (460 words)

I'm at a big house with a big pool behind it, a kind of meeting place/resort - you book into it for parties or suchlike, and I'm here as part of something, but wanting to leave. I've been in the house with my friend, and now I'm just going out past the pool, but lo and behold, down at this end you have to walk into the water on wood steps and things. Crossing to a kind of raft-thing, I then find there's no more steps all the way through this barn-like structure to the outside. I'm at a loss for a while - I'm in shorts, etc., not dressed for swimming, and not keen on it anyway. But I guess I have to, so I get down into it and find I can tread okay, I don't sink in all the way. I go on out and then realize I've left my purse and notebook on the raft. Damn. I have to go back for them, no help for it, so I do. There are a lot more people on it now, and I'm worried for a minute that my purse may not be there, but it is, almost under some others and between a couple of women sitting on each side. I get my things and [go out again? no continuity.] (218 words)

...Bopping down the street to music, I have to make a U-turn, and pass a couple of teenage boys on bikes - they look at me carefully to see if they can tell how old I am, very confused. I'm pleased with myself for looking and acting the way I like. I go on into this [cafeteria/bicycle shop?], and I'm talking to a young man at the counter - a family owns this place, and he's the son, there's others here. He responds for a bit, I'm asking where to buy a certain kind of used bike or can I get one repaired, and finally he just doesn't answer, wanders off. I go to his dad at the cash register. I try to tell him about it, and he ignores me too. They all do. I'm amazed and disappointed. I leave feeling incomplete, and go on back to the other place, only now it's late afternoon and there's not many people about, out in this end, a kind of long shed before the watery barn, there are tables - like picnic tables - but they're all wet now. I need to put my stuff down, but I have to look around before I find one that's not all over waterlogged. There are several large trays of leftover food, like party trays, fruit on lettuce, etc., that I'm planning to take along with me when we leave, but now I have the dilemma of how to get them across the water. This is a tough one. I've just been munching on something, a cookie maybe, and still chewing, and this guy comes up - he's one of the two guys who run this place - rather tall, burly, and means business, no nonsense. He says in no uncertain terms that "snack time is over" - meaning a sort of set tea that they have here, and I'm not supposed to be having "snacks" now - never mind that I haven't been here for their "snack time" and I'm eating my own whatsit. I get started organizing the trays to take across, when it suddenly hits me - I don't have to do this, you can just walk from the front of the house down the street past the pool to here. Well, I think, never mind, this way is shorter. [Another place] An old, dark wood church - my boyfriend (My ex?) and I have been roller-skating or something around here, and meant to go back through the back door to the front and outside, but there are some people here now - apparently getting something organized - and we have to be quiet and not attract too much attention. Outside, the street curves downward a lot, it's going to be mucho fun to whiz down. [Another place] I'm with a Mexican lady who has pottery to sell in an outdoor market. I need to pee quite a lot, but can't go to the bathroom, and I figure while she's not looking I can pee in one of the pots and then wipe it out. I try it one place, realize I'm too exposed, and move along a bit to a spot near an archway/alcove and find a big tall pot - I can just be sitting on it instead of squatting. But there's a man just ahead, he may look my way, and while keeping an eye on him I ease the pot off its ledge and down (with me on top of it) among some others sitting on the ground. I realize I must look very embarrassing. (593 words)

I'm at the desk in the library, and it's very busy just as we're getting ready to close. The place is huge, and the desk is long - someone else is checking out, and I'm at the money box. There are tables spread out in front of me, people everywhere, sounds of people talking, and plenty of kids. The light is more like a nightclub or something, mostly dark but with spots of light - a sort of overhead darkness [like yoga at Moonslice]. Actually my sense of the place is chaotic. I have the money drawer open, and something is dropped on the floor. I try to catch it, but don't, and then bend or squat to reach it. At the same time a little girl who's been boosted up to sit on the counter is crawling over it and letting herself down on my side. She's definitely in my way, and I tell her not to do that, but here she comes anyway. I've got my right hand in the drawer still, pushing it in as far as I can without closing it, but trying to make it so nobody can reach across the counter into it. I signal to Jenny at the other end of the counter to come get this kid, and she does, trying to be nice, but I'm saying, this is not okay for you to be here, you have to stay on the floor on the other side of the counter. No fooling. As I stand up, feeling more frustrated, there are 3 heads in front of me, 2 or 3 hands reaching across the counter trying to get into the money drawer. Now I get very imperious, and tell these kids - all boys - in no uncertain terms, get off the counter, stand on the floor, and stay there. Jenny (and maybe some others) look at me like I'm being awfully bold, here we are supposed to be nice to all the patrons, but my attitude at the moment is that I'd better let people know who's in charge here. Things are getting out of hand. Actually, the "boy" in the middle turns out to be a man, and he's miffed, because he just wanted change. I tell him that's fine and start counting out some ones, but they're all bad. In fact, there don't seem to be any nice clean flat bills at all - my word, here's one that's positively white! No, it's blank on one side - damn, this has got to be a Xerox copy! Here's another one! This is awful! Who took such bills? I look at another stack - there's quite a lot here - and find a nice bill, but damn! It's from a foreign country! It doesn't look anything like our bills! How could this happen? Here's another one - from the "Bank of Habbakuk" or some such name. O dear. The man is getting impatient, and says he'll take anything - I'm terribly embarrassed to have to tell him I haven't found anything he could spend yet. There's still a lot else going on around me, and suddenly the lights flick on & off, making me even more confused. It's one of our people over at the light switch down at the end of the counter, on the wall. He's just trying to get the patrons' attention, that it's time to leave. But with the light already the way it is, it's very disorienting. We tell him to stop. I'm just horrified at this situation with the money. (593 words)

I'm taking my car to Belmont Garage to get worked on, early early in the morning, and there's a new guy behind the counter who looks and sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's got on your basic mechanics' blue shirt and pants, and really doesn't look like him in the face, but everything else about him is a dead ringer - voice, accent, size, muscles, it's quite weird. We talk about the car, and he walks me outside to look at it, and I'm going to go on down the street to have breakfast. While he talks to me, I get very attracted to him, and he's being a little more than polite himself. In fact, he offers to walk along with me, and that's just fine. I'm still marvelling at how I could swear I'm with Arnold, except his face just looks different for the moment - or maybe this is how he "really" looks. Golly. So we walk along, and he even holds my hand, he's getting very attentive, this is swell. We get to the cafe, and I'm meeting some friends, who are around a table already - we'll have to squeeze in with extra chairs. There's some shuffling, me getting 2 chairs, somebody else getting one, taking back, putting in, then we get settled. This is a cute little place, close, chintzed-up, white with blue flowers, captain's chairs, early American, da da. We chat for a bit, and then I get up to do something at the next table, which is empty. [It has something to do with sorting keys or something, that relates to work, but I'm not getting it now - me and somebody else have these things out on the table, when these 2 ladies come along to sit there, and I apologize, clearing them off right away.] (255 words)

I'm at my Mom's, and she's got some shampoo that you don't have to use with water - it's a liquid gel, and you spread it on your hair with your hands, then you have to wipe them on something - and she says this is a good thing to do to keep the cats clean - you just wipe your hands on them. We're in the living room, they're sitting in chairs (like the real ones, but the whole room is a little different) - it's night and the lamps are on, yellow light. (95 words)

I'm with a group of people in a large building (house? - not where we live, though), and there's been a major altercation between this one man and another. It's over a misunderstanding but the one guy is distraught and won't listen to anybody, he wants to kill the other guy, and he's tough enough to do it. (He's not especially large, but strong, big shoulders, Italian-looking, sleeves rolled up, sort of Springsteen-Fonzie-like.) All these people are friends, and we want to prevent this, but the first guy goes off to get something [I presume he announces he's going for the sledgehammer which is in another place in the building - in any case, we know that's what he's doing], and I say to the others, "Oh no - if he's going for the hammer, the only one back there is the big one" - meaning there's regular ones, and a huge iron one that won't break, and is far more dangerous than the other kind. We're all frightened, and I wonder if I should go after the guy, but I don't think I could change his mind, and he might hurt me. We're all anxious to keep the other guy protected, but don't quite know how to do that. It's not like we're used to violence. We move to another room, but the first guy catches up with us, and there's a confrontation. Several tense moments pass, and then the violent guy breaks down - he can't do it, drops the hammer and his head, and cries. I feel so sorry for him - and then I feel guilty because I should've gone after him, even if I couldn't stop him, I should have stood with him, let him know he wasn't alone, that I cared that he was hurting. I really feel sad. Later, feeling I need to get out somewhere, I'm taking a thing back to someone who'd left it - it's somewhere between a metal folding chair and a child's wagon - and I'm going along a neighborhood path. It's night, though there are lights somewhere, I can see fine. This path goes along a creek or something, and there's trees and large bushes, which in one place get so thick I can't go on the path any more. I look around, thinking I could go behind this house and then between it and the next one, but it's late, people are probably in bed, they probably wouldn't like hearing a disturbance right by their houses. I decide to get back to the path by cutting through a more open place in the foliage, cutting off the bend. (At some point it is discovered that Whoopi Goldberg's name and address are on this article - I had previously found a different name on the front, and I was taking it to her, but someone pointed out the other name - I have to choose, so I figure I'll carry on as I am, and will find out later if it should go to Whoopi.)

I'm with somebody at (a/the?) library, looking in a large cabinet for a short cardboard tube that I can put something in - there's lots of cardboard here, being saved for projects, all sizes and colors, including a few tubes, most of which are too long and thin. Here's one, probably a paper-towel roll, flimsier but maybe... I go check it out but it's too short. I find a little Christmas wrapping paper on a couple rolls, and remark to the person I'm with, "Hey, maybe we should use this" - meaning, use it up instead of what she just got new - but we both say, "Nah - leave it," thinking why bother, let's just use all the same paper for everything. While I'm here, a guy comes along that we'd been told was coming to see someone here about the way we do something, or some equipment we use. He's introduced, but he doesn't get that we work here, I think he thinks we're also visitors or library patrons. Well, never mind, it doesn't matter. I go on out, got to get back somewhere, and I'm stepping off the sidewalk when a car comes swooping along and almost hits me. I wave my arms and yell after her, "You almost hit me!" but she doesn't stop - it's a woman with short brown hair in a light blue compact car - and I chase after her a bit, trying to get her to notice what she's doing. She turns around abruptly (the car, I mean) and drives up over the curb onto the sidewalk and toward an opening between a couple of stores. I realize suddenly, she's the one who does that all the time - I hadn't recognized her before. I wish there was a policeman here, wish someone would stop her. I run after her a little more, trying to see her license number, but it's a little out of range. At least maybe she'll think I saw it - but I bet that wouldn't impress her. I go on, carrying my stuff (I've got some bundles or something in my arms, that's why I couldn't run too good), and see across the street a little ahead, Gary Sheets and another friend I'm supposed to catch up with. I start to hurry forward, and about the same time pass by a closed-up storefront restaurant that used to be a chicken place. There's a sign posted that I notice, it says, "(something about fried chicken dinner) - $1.50", and I think how interesting that is, you mean it's been closed up that long? - I thought surely it would've been something since the chicken place. And it sure has been a long time, when was a chicken plate $1.50? Boy. There was something else above that, I hadn't looked at it, but now I'm past. I think I want to see. I should go on, though - but I want to tell Sheets about this, poof. Well, I settle on going back quickly to look, and it says something similar about maybe meat loaf or roast beef. Hokay. I bustle along, and cross the street to catch up with the guys. I tell Sheets about the restaurant, and he's amused too, as I thought he would be. We walk along, beside an open space at least a block in dimension, a sort of park - green grass, a few trees along the perimeter, people walking around. Down at this end there's a line of booths like a fair or carnival might have, all along the short edge and around each corner. (This is at least semi-permanent, no surprise, I'm not taking much notice of it.) Today, I'm seeing something different than usual - above the booths there are large rectangles of color, various patterns, mostly pastels, they look very pretty against the sky. I assume they're just decorative, and I look at them as I go by. (This is on my way home.) As I get closer, though, I realize they're not just painted cloth like banners, they're heavier. I think they're rugs. Wow. My brother and the other guy have drifted away a bit, looking at something, so I have to go back over to them to tell them about this, and we look around for the booth that's selling them. I might just be interested. (730 words)

I've come to the Business Office for a little visit with Michelle and to bring her a list of some stuff we want to get rid of from the branch. It's actually in the form of a "catalog", with pictures stuck to white pages and some kind of ring binder. I'm trying to interest Michelle casually in some of the stuff to keep, but we joke about it. I look at the rest of the office - it's been changed quite a lot by taking down some of the walls, and now Norma & Marilyn can work together easier, everybody moves around, very open. I'm not going to stay long, so I don't want to get into any conversations with any of the others. [Note: the personnel are accurate, and the overall design of the office.] I go down the back hall to the bathroom and chat with some other folks along the way. There's a stray kitty here, and I think I'd better take him along and take care of him - maybe I'll see if Michelle wants him. But I decide to go back by way of the first floor, and when I get around to the front I realize, whoops, probably I shouldn't go across the public area with a cat, I'd better go back to the staff elevators. [This place is looking more like a hotel than a library - flowered carpet, fancy appointments, etc.] At the elevator we have to wait with some other folks for a while, and I examine the cat's stomach. I had noticed earlier a kind of rough spot, thinking it was a sticker or burr stuck to his fur. It's not, though, it's some kind of hard thing that's burrowed into his skin, and the top of it protrudes. Looks like he'll need to have that removed. The elevator comes, and we squeeze in - it has a glass wall, though there's not much to see outside - there's a person next to me, against the back wall, that looks like a homeless person, and smells a bit. He/she says something to me, but he/she looks and sounds rather sinister and I try to ignore it. By the time we get off, the kitty's missing (in the shuffle) and I have to look for it. ------scene shift------- I'm at Hope's house (Hope and her mom, actually) - they're out and I'm house-sitting; I'm stepping outside to look for the cat on the street (it's night now), and I walk up a bit, nearly out of the light from the sliding glass doors, and I see some movement. There's a cat, but not mine, and a man's shape is moving toward me. As he becomes visible, I see (having been nervous) that he's a neighbor - tall, black, greying, a nice man, though taciturn - and we say hello, I tell him what I'm doing. [I'm not sure about the next part, if my cat shows up or not, but I'm trying to get in the door, or let my cat in, and a number of other cats slip in while I have the door open a crack.] He offers to help me get the other cats out, so we go inside. There's a long table laid with food for guests, and some people start to show up and sit down. Some have brought others with them, and pretty soon the place is bustling with chatty people crowding in. I'm very much disconcerted - some of these are very colorful people, like we found them at a carnival. A few biker types, but all quite friendly. What am I going to do with all these people? Hope comes home and is surprised. [Maybe another scene, I'm fiddling with my tooth - the capped one - and convinced it's loose, I actually pull it loose, I'm horrified.] (549 words)

My mother's recently married Patrick Duffy - he has an interfering ex-wife. We're sitting at dinner and he talks about her walking in from time to time. Oh, swell - she's probably my age and I have to contend with a stepmother. I'm visiting Jerry Seinfeld at his apartment, and we decide to get married. It's pretty casual - seems like a convenience thing, although underneath we really like each other, but we're both hesitant because we don't know each other very well. He takes my notebook and writes some information about himself on it, birthdate, parents' names, etc. There's someone else here, a friend of his, and he's kind of doubtful too but thinks it's fun. I need to leave, and go out to my car - the apartment is inside a building, the door is heavy. Crossing the courtyard, there's a lawn, like a park, people are playing on it - I pass some kids on my left, then have to skirt a pond. It doesn't have any edges, it soaks out of its perimeters gradually, and the grass around it is spongy and wet. I don't get far enough out because of the kids and my shoes get wet. [I either fall down or stumble] and drop this little mermaid that Jerry gave me into the pond. It's very shallow and clear, and there are a number of ornaments like this already in it - it crosses my mind I might pick up something else besides my own, but I want mine - they're gold, they float, some are like my mermaid in that they have no floating base, but a solid, curved extension with a ball on the end that keeps them balancing. I pick up my own and go on out. There's a glass door, then a bit of parking lot next to the street. My car is parked right next to the wall, and is nearly pinned in by the next car, parked at an angle, and some sort of rack-thing in front. I walk around the car, checking what I can do, taking off my red coat, and when I get back to the other side I decide I can move the rack - but I notice I don't have my coat. There's someone else with me, a sort of companion, and I ask her if she saw what I did with it - maybe I hung it on that rack. She doesn't see it at first, but then finds it. (412 words)

I'm in Florida, married, in a house with (family?) - Jack Palance is here, and a woman [his wife?], and we've been mentioning the electricity, it's had to be cut off and restored because of some external problem. I pick up the phone to call MasterCard about my balance, but there's no dial tone. Just about the same time Jack plugs the transformer into the wall, and then a tone comes on. He rigged that to disconnect, too, to save trouble and electricity. Not a bad idea. I call, and find that I can't get the information without calling The city - a man at a bank here tells me he can't get access to that information, I'll have to transfer my account to Florida. I'm very concerned about that - what if I get it transferred? That's so permanent, do I want to do that? What if I change my mind? --------- Later, being outside at the beach, I feel confused but optimistic - here I am married to a nice-looking guy, and in a place where everybody goes to the beach, my being fat doesn't seem to matter so much. I picture myself having a ball playing with people in the water, relaxing in the sun. I wonder what it would be like to want to stay in Florida. I'm in a store, something like a grocery store, and we're closing for the day. Harry Anderson is my boss, but we're quite close. There's some kind of apprehension, like someone's liable to break in and we have to be real careful to lock up. I try a side door that usually isn't opened, and by George it is. I call to Harry to come lock it, and he doesn't come right away, he thinks I'm mistaken, and I have to urge him. I'm quite concerned, keep watching out. (309 words)

I'm with Dan & Lynn and Peggy & James at some kind of fair - seems to be on city streets - there's a lot of activity, and you can sit down and watch programs from time to time. We've been doing that, and I've been keeping an eye on this model of a temple (some famous ancient, maybe Biblical temple), which was flooded and I guess destroyed, which was its claim to fame. [I'm not sure if we're all watching this or if I'm watching it on the side - I have bought the model for myself, and I think it's the latter.] The water comes up and rushes through, knocking things down and so on, then recedes, how interesting. The program ends, and we'll be getting up to go elsewhere, but I'd better put this in the car or else it'll get lost, stolen, or thrown out. The car's just here, and I start to deal with it, but the others are going away - they're not even paying any attention to me, except James, who is looking like he can't figure out what to do, to stay or go, to protest or not. I'm aghast. How can they just walk off and leave me? I stand in frustration, what can I do here? They'll be swallowed up by the crowd in a minute, how will I ever catch up to them? Do I even want to? I'm so furious I'd just be - prefer to be - enraged at them. But apparently they're oblivious anyway. Damn... There's a cop or security guard nearby who offers to help, and we get to talking [much like me & Russ at the Jewelry Workshop], which makes me feel better. We go nearby to his house, while he picks up something, and we're gonna catch a movie on TV. I've got a carton of Cookie Dough ice cream, and eat some while he's in the other room. When he comes back I offer him some, saying, "Have you ever tasted this?" And then when I'm looking away, he eats all the rest of it. More frustration. I'm just fed up. (321 words)

I'm in a foreign country, maybe Eastern Europe, with a group of people - we're here for a LT, this country's first. Right now we're watching a movie, maybe in a bus. At least it's a narrow and short place, not a theatre at all, and we're sitting close together. I've been out, and come back to find my order has arrived - Elsa is keeping it for me - there's a big bowl of hot fudge, a wide shallow bowl [abt. 4" x 14"], it's wonderful, dark, bubbly, still hot; chocolate-chunk cookies [big ones like you get at The supermarket], I can dunk them in the hot fudge; and some other chocolate stuff. It's an awful lot, and looks extremely self-indulgent. I can share, but still I wonder what the others must think of this pile of chocolate... Later, we go to our hotel and have dinner - the rest of the chocolate stuff comes with me - in a dining room with a long table. I get up to go to the bathroom, my room is nearby; the room and bathroom are kind of bare, cheapish, sort of what you might expect in a poor country. While I'm there, the toilet slides out from next to the sink and outside, down the street. This is not especially uncommon, although it is disconcerting. I think I should put it back where it was. I'm now next to a park, on a broad street. There's not much traffic, but people I know are nearby, and I ought to go along with them, but I tell them I'm going to push the toilet back into my room... At some point I'm concerned about Tree's food, where I can get the right kind of kidney food that he needs. I only brought one can with me and I don't think that'll last. (300 words)

I'm out on my bicycle, riding with a black man [I know him, but I think I work with him, not a friend socially] - we're in a part of town like maybe the Love Field area, or some parts of Oak town - away from downtown, run down. We're crossing a big intersection at a light, there are stores set back from the street. Another man (also black) on a bicycle passes us going the other way, and as he comes to the intersection he raises his arm high in the air, hand straight. So does the man I'm with. I'm guessing that it's some sort of bicycle road signal, indicating that you're going to cross the intersection - I never heard of it before. Hmm. But they keep their arms up as they pass each other, and when they're close to, they acknowledge each other, then drop their arms after they've passed. Oh - I guess it was a black salute of some kind. Hmm. Just at the other side of the intersection, another vehicle turns out of the parking lot to our left (it's on a rise) and passes us crossing the street, and its driver gives the same salute. This thing is a kind of pedal cart, the driver at the back, a passenger sitting on a chair, sideways - it's a woman, white, the driver's a black man - on a platform. Looks a little clumsy, but they seem quite comfortable with it. Hmm. (235 words)

I'm with 3 friends, another girl and a couple of boys. We're out just sort of strolling around a park, noplace special to get to, but more or less aiming for the other side. There's lots of dense green stuff to poke through, little paths, rises, a creek. As we explore, one of the boys - he looks like Wil Wheaton - is telling us about this movie he was in, that this reminds him of. He'd been knocked out or something, and was face up floating in the creek as it went under a (culvert? is that right?), and leaves & vines floated over him and tangled around his throat as he went under, and inside the culvert he woke up, choking. As he tells this, we all see it, as if in flashback, from overhead. He comes out the other side pulling the vines from his neck, struggling to survive. Very dramatic. He likes to tell us about his exploits. We come out of the woods and there's a building here, we go into it - it's a place we're familiar with but don't go into much. [It could be a library - there are aisles of some kind, very high, maybe floor-to-ceiling stacks, so that you can wander around in them.] We're looking around, together and separately, it's dim (the place is not open), and spooky enough to be fun. [Some event happens, but apparently not onstage, to produce the next bit.] The others are making their way toward the other exit, and I'm hanging back a bit, still exploring, and as I turn a corner I see something startling - the other boy is standing in one of the aisles behind our group [though actually he's looking like a man in a suit]. He stands still, looking away from me, and seems quite grim. There's something wrong here. Moving around quietly and carefully, I see more of them - replicas of my friend - and also some others. I realize that what must have happened is [this event I mentioned] and there are duplicates being created - but they're all replicas of the dark side of this person, none of the nice parts. This is very alarming. We've got to get out of here - I get back to the others as fast as I can and tell them, and we go out - I think if we get him out this thing that's happening will stop. We come out to a part of the park that's sculptured and open, a walkway and water running through a man-made concrete bed alongside, flower beds, etc. It's sunny out. [Out here, there's something about somebody - the boy? being in the water, but it's gone.] (391 words)

I'm with my father - a priest - in his office in a church (or some such place), a nice old building, lots of dark wood and heavy furniture. I work with him, and we're getting ready to leave for another church, not far away, even older. [Scene changes.] The new place looks medieval, and we're in a dim stone room with lamps. There's a woman here, must be some kind of administrator, here to work with us, getting things organized. She's got on this fabulous headdress, it's somewhat Slavic in shape, hard side pieces that extend round to the back and continue in a long sort of tail. It's red, with heavy beading, wonderful. I tell her I like it, and she agrees, she just had to have it, got it just recently (at a fair or something). She's blonde, rather fleshy, friendly but not especially jolly. My father is somewhat like Andy Griffith... We are going to see my brother in the hospital [he's not My brother]. It's quite a complicated place, high security - not for casual patients, these are also psychiatric patients, and convicts. My brother did something, and he's been here for treatment. They've put us in this room that you wait in off the elevator. There's nothing here but some lounge-type furniture, and nobody tells us anything. Sometimes we hear announcements over a loudspeaker. My father goes away to do something - we've been waiting a long time and we're getting impatient. I wait longer and longer, and finally pick up the wall phone and start to ask them to investigate. But just then my brother is brought in. We hug and kiss, it's very emotional, he's very lonely. He looks okay, not great, but getting better, but so sad. He keeps kissing and touching me, and I'm a little uncomfortable with it - I wonder if not being around women for so long he's also wanting to touch me just because I'm a woman. (326 words)

I'm on my way somewhere, driving a car with a female passenger - she's not a friend, and I'm thinking she's not comfortable with my driving - this road has a lot of curves and the lanes aren't marked (there's no paving, though it's good and solid, and smooth - and it's through town, sorta like Oak town), and possibly I'm too close to the wall sometimes - there's a wall median divider, and we're driving on the left of it. I'm just waiting for her to bitch about it, but trying to stay out so she won't get nervous. I'm also looking around at the cute little houses that line the road, and thinking it would be nice to live in one of them - there's a grocery store right down the street, very convenient, there are lots of nice things about it - but it is a very busy street, hmm, why would I be thinking about that anyway? Not my kind of place... Later, I'm at a going-away party for a fellow employee, in a restaurant-bar. It's fairly dark, and there aren't many people I know here, and I don't feel like mingling much. I'm sitting at the bar looking at a magazine. There's an article in series about this young man who's had a number of turns in his life. The first piece is headed, "Jail 1", and chronicles what led up to him doing something that he went to prison for and how that affected him. The text goes down the left half of the page, picture on the right. He's nice-looking, dark hair, sort of a country-boy type, but apparently a very nice guy who made a few mistakes. The next piece, "Jail 2", comes after another article or 2, and tells the next story, and then the 3rd piece tells about him having a sex change. There are pictures here, too, but also there's a TV nearby - must be up behind the bar because I'm looking up - and there's her, and her girlfriend on TV, probably videotape. There's a closeup, and you can see it's him and all, and I'm thinking he doesn't make a very good-looking woman. Oh, well. There's a woman sitting next to me, middleaged, she's looking over my shoulder and making the occasional lame remark like, "Why would anybody do such a thing?" I decide it's time to mosey on off, and take a few steps toward the door, when I'm grabbed by this cheerful young woman with somebody else in tow, she says, "How are you? You really look good, come with me", dah dah dah. I think she must be somewhat drunk, as a number of people are getting. She grabs my waist and tugs me over to a seated group and proceeds to chat with them too - "Look who I found!" - the thing is, I don't know these people. I think she doesn't realize that, and the others must assume she does. Oh my. I'm trying to think of a way to extricate myself. (512 words)

I'm trying to get a truck to start; I'm at a small parking lot by the side of a dirt road, with a short open fence. There are some other people around, none of them are helping me. I need to push it to get it to start, but there's a slight upgrade in the road and I think I'm stuck. I wish somebody would come along and push it for me - it would take a truck, I'm picturing somebody in a U-Haul, rented, maybe they'd think they shouldn't do it. I'm in the Philippines, Manila; on some kind of business trip, but Dad & my stepmother live here and I wonder if I should go visit them. Right now I'm out wandering, sort of sightseeing. There's not much to see, around here anyway - I'm staying in an area near the airport (or train station) and there's mostly hotels and American-style restaurants, so I'm looking for real Filipino stuff. I've been with some other people but they've taken the bus back to the hotel, they weren't keen on this area, it's not exactly nice. I'm concerned myself - I keep my eyes open for dangerous-looking people. I'm thinking about something to eat, and there are food places around, not American-style, which sounds interesting. I go up to the counter of one stand and talk to the man there, looking at his menu. He's pretty nice to me, we talk about the area and he explains some things on the menu, I start to order something, and suddenly realize I don't have any cash on me. Can he take traveller's checks? He says yes, but by now I decide I'd better go back to the hotel - I'm not sure about this food, don't know if it would agree with me. While we're talking, though, the bus has come through the area - right off the street, yet - and gone. I'll have a wait. I go along, past some office buildings, and run into a disturbance. A lot of people are running away from something, and there's some shouting and sirens - I learn that there's a huge fire just on the other side of this block, behind these buildings. I figure I'd better get away too, so I turn and go, noticing the smoke roiling up behind the building, and the tops of flames, or flickering firelight. I can see, through gaps between buildings, the vehicles and people moving over there - there's music coming from over there, too, and I recognize the tune from a network news show. They must have a crew there. Good grief. Must be some fire to have all these news people there. I go on, not far away, to Dad & My stepmother's house. I knock, and they answer - surprised to see me, but only because it's unexpected. I go in and chat away, about the fire and the news people - I mention the music - I follow Dad down the hall into the den. There's a tired-looking orange square-cushioned couch. I ask if I can stay the night; I don't think I'll be able to get back with all the commotion. They say okay, why not? I figure the couch won't be all that comfortable, but what the hell. (Maybe I should call the hotel and tell them I won't be using the room tonight, and they won't charge me for it - but no, my luggage is still there, never mind.) (584 words)

I run this "castle" sort of place. I've got a problem with this guy - a sort of wizard - who wants to take over, I've heard of his plot with another guy, and I'm sort of at a loss right now. I'm looking for Michael Keaton, who's staying here, I like him a lot and he helps me do things, he's very clever, though elusive when it comes to a relationship. I don't really know where I stand with him. I go down where he stays but he's not there. I'm quite frustrated, I need his advice. I see other people going about their business, and I wonder if they know how confused I am, and how they think of me as an administrator. Somewhere I find this note. It's from the housekeeper, she's a nice round ruddy-cheeked woman - she says that she didn't want to tell tales, but somebody is skimming off something and pocketing the proceeds, and she thought I should know. Well, I'm glad she wrote me this note, but it's a couple of years old. It must have been lost all this time. Still, I'll do some investigating. While I'm reading this, I'm eating an ice-cream cone (it's a pretty big scoop on a little bitty cone) and trying to climb a wall. I need to haul myself over the top, and I'm hesitant to do it with the ice-cream cone. After a couple of false starts I do it. It's okay. I go on to cross this sort of pond thing next to some bleacher seats (concrete or stone, I think), and finally see Michael across the way, going the opposite direction. I call to him, saying I need to see him. It's taken him some effort (I think magic was involved) to get where he is without getting wet, and he's not too keen on coming back across, but he does - partly from friendship, but also because I am in charge. I tell him I need his help, he says okay. (340 words)

I'm with a group of men and women - 3 or 4 of each, all middleaged or older - and we've just come from some seminar or something, it's late, and we're visiting at the house that one of the women - her name is Louise or maybe Betty - lives in, a very nice, small, comfortable house, she's been here for many years, I think she's a widow. We're all very friendly, we're having a good time together. Except for Rita - she's unhappy [for some reason I've forgotten - might have an element of jealousy] with Louise/Betty and decides she'd better leave. I walk with her through the kitchen to the front door, feeling awkward, wishing I could help. She walks on out to her car - I think one or more of the men came with us, and I let them go on ahead back to the living room. I hang back in the hallway - it's rather cluttered, more like a back hallway than a front hallway, but it does lead to the street. Near the door to the kitchen, I notice a folded note on the floor, and I pick it up. Rita must have dropped it. I open it and glance at it; it seems to be for Louise/Betty - I wonder if it's about their problem. I think maybe I ought to give it to Louise/Betty, but then Rita hadn't done it herself, maybe that would be wrong. I go back through the kitchen and decide I'd better get rid of it. I wad it up in my hand as unobtrusively as I can - I could be seen from the living room if anyone was looking this way - and casually toss it in the trash can that's in an open pantry or alcove right before the door, just as I go on through.

I'm visiting Karen, who's at home with her little boy (who is about 2 instead of a baby). Her husband comes in unexpectedly - he is a very unpleasant man, and Karen is very uncomfortable - you could say she even looks scared, and it's apparently because I'm there - she's not supposed to have visitors, it seems, and he is very disapproving. I feel intimidated myself, and figure I'd better go. Outside, I see some of Peter's sculpture - he's an artist - at the entrance to the house. One of them, on the left, is a sort of spire, or extremely large spike. It's metal, dark, pointed at the top, wider at the bottom, and there's something at the bottom that looks like a small dog lying on its back with its head away from me and its feet up, almost as if it were impaled on the spike. Another, smaller dog, a puppy, is standing in front of it (and the not dissimilar piece next to it), barking. This whole thing is up on a ledge or platform almost at eye level. As I look at the first piece, I am more and more disconcerted - it really does look real - it couldn't be, could it? I stare at it, fascinated. Then suddenly it moves, kicks its back legs up as if it was trying to pull free, to get up. It is real! Oh hell. Oh, hell. I don't want to believe this. He's actually impaled a dog on this thing, because he thinks it's art. Oh, hell. It goes through my mind to rescue it, but how in the world could I possibly do anything that would help? I know it must be bleeding to death, why in the world is it still alive anyway? I don't want to look around at the other side, on my right, that's been obscured by the puppy - but I do, and sure enough, yes, there's blood gushing out from its side, hell, there's nothing I can do, I've got to get away from here. [Either I go back in and tell Karen about this, Peter being gone again, and she decides to come with me, or on my way to the car she catches up, with her little boy, knowing she has to get away herself, and protect her child from this man, who's been getting increasingly more dangerous.] (348 words)

I'm going to the toilet in this open space - the building is where I work, I think - the toilet is located at the end of a wall between two areas, and faces some seats. There's a couple of women sitting there, and there's a man sitting up on the wall - I think in an opening of some sort, he sits up there to oversee whatever goes on below, like a lifeguard. He's chatting with the women some. I've got a gas problem, and am very uncomfortable. I sit and try to let it out very slowly and not make any noise, but it takes a long time and they're noticing and snickering. There's also a man in the space behind me, and he notices too, but he's trying to be polite and not look. The guy on the perch says something aloud to the women, and I really feel angry and humiliated. I glare up at him, and say "Fuck you" - muttering, not wanting to start an argument. But he gets angry, jumps up and climbs down. He comes over to me on the toilet, waggles his fingers and says, "Come with me." He's playing offended, and apparently means to turn me in for being insolent or insubordinate. I get up and walk with him, saying, "I wonder if you've really thought about this." I'm thinking, even if he reports me to somebody, I've got a very good case here, he's the one who ridiculed me, in front of others - even the man behind me was laughing. I'm picturing myself defending in front of somebody, and them realizing what a jerk he is, and they'll probably turn on him. I ask him where we're going, and he says, "Oh, about 10 floors up" - he's very supercilious. I realize he means to report me to the director. Oh, please. This is out of hand. I stop, and sharply say, "Look here, you stop - I am not going to be taken to the principal's office like some schoolgirl. This is ridiculous." (346 words)

I am in a garage, having my car worked on - something to do with the wheels, or rotating the tires. I'm chatting with the mechanics, I've seen them before, though not to work on my car, I think. We're casual friends, and this is a friendly sort of little neighborhood garage. The burlier guy says it'll be $89.95 to do the work. I roll my eyes and say, fine, ok, at least it isn't any more than that, all the other work I've had done lately has been a lot more, this isn't so bad. I'm feeling pretty lively, strutting around in my new black motorcycle boots and jeans. The other mechanic is noticing, and points at my boots to the other one, a sort of elbow-in-the-ribs look. I think I look spiffy. (134 words)

I am playing (sort of) with a Komodo dragon, a baby. We're in the living room or hallway of a house, near the stairs, and I'm sitting on the floor. It's a cute little thing, and I'm patting it, trying not to get it too excited, because if you get too involved with them, and especially when you try to get away or stop playing, they may bite - and their bite is poisonous. It really wants to stay close, though, and I'd like to get away, but it crawls around to my back and parks there, curling up to take a nap. If I get up, I'm afraid I'll disturb it, and it'll snap at me in reflex. I'm really scared. I don't know what to do. [As I wake up, I'm imagining what it would be like if I did disturb it, and had to fight it off. I envision whirling around and pulling back to keep away, and feeling frantic. This is not what I meant to do - I'm losing control here.] (128 words)

I'm in a sort of attic, a partially finished loft, where there are some old things stored, especially childrens' things - it all looks like the turn of the century or perhaps up to the 20's - I'm looking for something, and I'm setting up some books that have fallen over. While I'm at it, I'm sorting them for size, just because, why not? I'm near the ladder down to the next floor, and someone down there (a man) is speaking to me, wanting to know if I need any help - he's concerned about me being up here alone, wants me to be careful on that ladder. I'm quite all right, everything's just fine. (115 words)

A group of us are looking at this house we want to rent. It certainly looks good, just my sort of place - old, well furnished, great shape - nice stuff, good wood furniture. We look at the living room and a couple of bedrooms. I'm wondering where the 3rd bedroom can be - I guess we may have to make do somehow, but really however good it looks, it may just be too small for us. But then the rental agent takes us through another door to a hallway, and here's other rooms - actually quite a number of them, it turns out - this place is much bigger than we thought, too big really, but at this price, my word, this is too good to be true - I love this house, it's just gorgeous.

I'm in Africa with a group [probably for a Training - similar premise], and we're at the end of what we're doing. I'm going on to another city in a couple of days on my own, for a festival, it's going to be lots of fun. A couple of us are going off on an errand in a taxi, we're very jolly, and there's another man sharing. He's got some money in his hand, and he gives it to me, saying something about a nice thing happening to him, and somebody else should share. I'm flabbergasted, but I take it, oh yes, very grateful. It's a sort of unkempt handful of bills, various denominations, and I have an idea it may add up to quite a lot. Wow. This is very disconcerting. I wonder if I can really keep it, or should I give to the Training? Is that expected of me? But he just gave it to me - I figure it can be all mine. I don't count it while the man is here, that would be impolite... We go on to our destination and back, then I count it. It's not as much as I'd thought - not hundreds - but still it'll do for helping me with some new clothes for my excursion. I'm telling a friend about it back at the Training, when I realize - whoops! I'm going in only two days! How did it get so close? How am I going to get ready in time? I've got lots of arrangements to make! [The next part is sort of mixed up with a movie I may be watching.] In the other city, I'm staying in an apartment that used to be something else, maybe a stablehouse or something. It's going to be renovated later, and fixed up nice. I'm telling someone else about this, saying, "Just think about how this will look - won't it be nice?" I've got a takeout meal - probably Indian, it's soupy, like a curry, and I'm dumping it out on a plate. It's got meat in it, I'd forgotten about that - but oh, never mind, I can just pull the pieces out. There's even a big piece of bacon, and I think to myself, they just can't help themselves, have to put bacon in everything, don't they? (Meaning the English.) This woman who's been staying here for a long time, with her sister I think, is due to go home soon. She's dressed rather Victorian, high-necked white blouse, long skirt, high-button shoes, hair up in a big roll. Something's going on in the area that a man is responsible for, and there's going to be an election. She decides to stay and run for office so she can oppose him. (This is a movie, I think.)

I'm with Dr Who [Tom Baker] and a boy; we're in a small place with some other people, and the Doctor is doing an experiment that will demonstrate something, or help something, and we're not sure it's done yet. The boy has a tube of some kind in his stomach - it's in a metal shaft-fixture, and I'd say the tube itself is at least a foot long - part of it goes up inside of him, and the whole thing folds up so it doesn't stick out. The experiment is with something inside the tube, and you have to break it to get it out. Dr Who holds the fixture and carefully breaks the glass. I have to help him get the glass shards out - I scoop them up gently with both hands, and he holds his other hand out and I put the broken bits in it; then he throws them away. Shortly I've picked the bits from around the thing inside, and he takes that out to examine it. I think the results are inconclusive. The boy wants to go home, he's not willing to wait any longer, and even though we're not done, he goes. [I don't know how he gets there, but we are like the Doctor's other companions, he lives somewhere away from wherever we are now - probably on another planet. Wherever that is, he knows how to go there and does.] The Doctor is concerned because of the broken bits of the glass tube left in the boy's stomach. So we go after him. Before we get there, I can see the scene: He arrives in his family's house - his mother is there, she's got on a long skirt and a long-sleeved blouse, and an apron - her hair is up in a bun. She's nice, youngish, busy. Also he has a baby sister, she's very lively, running around, into everything, quite cute, blond, pink cheeks. The room makes me think it's almost a log cabin, on the rustic side, the room I see has got hardly any furniture in it. His mother barely greets him at all - you'd think she didn't even know he was gone. She leaves him to watch the baby - who needs a lot of watching - and goes into another room. [We arrive, and I don't know what brings us to the next scene, but we've all gone somewhere else and he's needing to call home before we leave where we are now - all part of our adventure.] We're at this public telephone, which also has other functions - perhaps it's also an ATM - and it has a different setup from your usual telephone keypad. The face is silver and the buttons are concave like real public phones, though. He's given me the number, and I'm trying to do it, but we're losing the light and I can't see the numbers, and I keep punching the wrong ones because they're in the wrong places. I'm trying to concentrate very hard - I get the number I need straight, and then try to focus on the numbers on the keypad and get them clear before pressing, and finally I get all but the last one and then I've got it, just right, and still when I get my finger up there I hit the wrong one because my finger made me lose my focus. I'm very frustrated and anxious. We've got to get away from here, time is passing. It's almost too dark to see now. (514 words)

I'm in (my?) apartment, upstairs, at the end of a walkway with an open railing - either I'm just moving in or out, or we're doing a big spring cleaning - me and my roommate. The door is standing open, it's nice outside, bright sunshine. I step out the door briefly and see two guys at the end of the walkway, facing away from me - one's leaning on the rail, but one's got Alleycat in a jar - it's a great big round jar with a huge mouth, and he had just crawled in there out of curiosity, as cats do. (I may have put the cork in myself - playing with him.) I don't know how this guy got Alleycat, but I'm scared and worried - I know (somehow) that they're bad guys, and they're planning to break in here and rob us. I could just close the door - I duck back inside - but I've got to be careful of Alleycat. I don't want him to get hurt. Actually it might be okay if he just dropped the jar - it would probably break, and then Alleycat could run off - but that would be a gamble, and he might get hurt. I'd better get the bad guy to put him down. I'm not sure what I should do, but I've got to do something; I'm angry, too, and I want to fight... I do something to attract their attention, and they come in after us. [I think my roommate has been inside the whole time and is acting with me.] I grab a stick - a broomstick maybe, about that size, and start fighting with the one that had Alleycat. [I don't know what's happened to him.] I try to swing at him, but it seems like I'm just not hitting very hard - I'm not making much of a dent (no pun intended). I'm getting frustrated and feeling a little desperate. Why can't I do anything here? I really want to at least hold my own, but I seem to be too weak. (327 words)

I'm with a group of people, particularly including teenage kids, sheltering under some big ledge sort of thing while something is happening in the sky - it's all filled with rolling dark clouds, there are funny lights. (I don't know what's going on or what might happen, but it's big and ominous.) Something changes in one part of the sky -it looks like a shape is forming, and the colors are changing, reds and yellows. I tell the others to look at it. We're getting frightened. There's a girl next to me, she's about 14 I guess, and she says something like, "What are we going to do?" I turn to her and say it's going to be all right, I'm sure we'll get out of this okay. She looks dubious, looks around her and starts talking to her friends. I think she doesn't trust me. I'm a little disappointed. (Later) I'm on a dark street in a little parking space just next to the curb, standing outside and near the car, with somebody else, a man, a friend. (We've been with some others previously - possibly the group from the other dream.) He needs to go somewhere for a little while to take care of something, he should be back soon. Meanwhile I'll wait, but it's not a very nice neighborhood and it looks deserted, the street looks slick as if it had rained, and the street light glares down yellow... Down at the other end of this space, at the corner, a group of boys have collected, all black, they may be a gang, and they're harassing a boy that I know -he's black too, maybe 12 or 13, and he's part of something we do (maybe the previous group, maybe we do something with a recreation center). Nice kid. The others are trying to intimidate him, they're not hostile yet. I can catch some of their words, and one or two of them sound like they're about me. Somebody points my direction. Now I'm wondering if they're talking about doing something to me. Oh, dear. I start to speculate about getting in the car and driving off. I'm worried and anxious. 
       Later: I'm at the library, at a row of shelving, checking through some things. Everyone's attention is directed forward, as if somebody's teaching a class or giving a talk at the front of the room. (And maybe so.) I find a group of cards, look through them, and find mixed in there's some [paper library card applications]/wedding invitations for Geoffrey's wedding. They've got names on them for people I recognize, and it's very stupid for them to be mixed in here. Who did this? (Me, I wonder? - I don't think so.) Well, hell; now what? I should do something about them - call the people up, I guess. I know at least one of them's out of town. I'd better go do that. I turn around and see the next shelf (sorting shelves) is still not sorted completely yet. I'd better do that right quick. I stick my arm out to put the "invitations" down and knock over a lot of books, though I catch some before they go all over. Oh, great. Well, I'll fix it. VK comes over and tells me to let (somebody) do this, he'll be just fine, we need to let him. (This guy isn't visible, but I picture him in my mind's eye as Benny on "L.A. Law". He's slow but quite competent, and new here at the library, we're all learning what he can do.) I tell VK about the "invitations" and go off to deal with them. (608 words)

Debbie Reynolds is doing a musical (maybe "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" at this local theater, with our amateur theater group, and I'm at a rehearsal. I'm helping out in the back, I think, and I've finished for now. But I'm just looking at what they're doing on the stage, trying to get a scene right, and Debbie (who's directing) tells me to come forward and deliver a line. (Actually, I and a couple of other people were just crossing the stage to leave when she noticed us.) She's trying to get something across to the cast and it isn't coming. So they do the bit and I say my line a couple-three times, and that's okay. I go on... I'm taking this light-blue Volkswagen Beetle that's borrowed off this ledge, somewhat like a loading dock. But there are cars parked all around it except one spot on the far side, and I'll have to lower it off the edge. It's not too hard, but I have to be careful not to drop it. I can let it down one end at a time - it has a sort of pole linking the front end and the back end, and it's jointed, so I can guide it. I get it down okay. Next I'm at Gail's house with some women, toward the end of a visit. I'm in the kitchen with her, and there's a bag of some new kind of croutons, they have different kinds of bread - some light, some dark, they'e very good. (One of us is telling the other that she's just discovered these, try them, they're really good.) Also Gail shows me a Sunday comic that she saved for me, it's funny. I'm ready to leave, though, and I go on. There's also a young man here, he's interesting-looking, but I don't get to know much about him - I'm shying away.I go on outside, and have a look at this drain-plug sort of thing. It's a brass-colored metal fixture in a shallow hole in the front walk, with a little hole in the middle of it. There's supposed to be something plugging up that hole, and earlier I poured some white glue into it to help seal it up. Now I'm examining it, picking at the rounded top to see if it's dried, and pour some more glue in from a large bottle I've taken from the house. Satisfied that it'll dry properly to fill up the space, I take the glue back into the house to just return it and go. Inside, I see the young man just inside the next-room doorway, and put the bottle in his hands, saying something like, "Will you put this back, please?" As I'm turning toward the door again, he moans something about how he's going to die and people just use him to fetch and do errands. I turn back to look - he is the very picture of a whiner. I listen to him for a while, and we go into the next room to talk. As he handles the glue bottle, I realize he's blind. Golly. I'm interested and sympathetic, but I realize he needs somebody to help him just feel like a normal person. Apparently he does have other illnesses or disabilities, but he's not really (or necessarily) going to die - he's just being dramatic. He lays on the floor, and while we're still talking, I sit on his back - gently, carefully. I think he could use some massage to his poor tired body, and I adjust a bit - he doesn't protest - and then rock back and forth to give pressure on his back muscles. (615 words)

I'm walking out sort of in the country, or the edge of town, intending to get somewhere but seeing all nice things around - the sky, trees, all that, feeling quite perky. I'm taking a different street because it's interesting. It gets very steep - I'm thinking while climbing up it about a situation in an earlier part of the dream, where the exercise group I work out with wants to split up. Part of us are gonna stay where we are, and part move out north somewhere to the edge of town, which will include Gail's - I'm really torn whether I want to go out there with them or stay where I am, which is a great deal more convenient - where I'm used to. They're gonna expect me to make a decision. The sidewalk starts out going by something like a hotel - a big single building, very nicely done, landscaping, set back from the road a bit - nothing on the other side of the street, but there's a regular sidewalk - I pass that up, walking by some houses - it gets steeper & steeper, to the point where I'm just climbing, using my hands even. I guess I might be able to straighten up - I rather doubt it. I'm passing by trees, all that. I keep thinking I'm gonna get to the top - I could turn around & go back of course - I do want to come to a stopping point. When I've gotten up there, there's a house, & I go inside, apparently because I'm supposed to or because it's normal to, but something has changed completely. I see a woman (I have turned into a male policeman, who's married to or was married to the woman who lives here - I used to live here too. There's some people in the front of the house who don't know me and have been inquiring why I want to see her - whether it's ok or not. But I do go back and talk to her, particularly about a TV set and whether or not I should keep it or she should. It's rather awkward but it shouldn't be - it doesn't need to be, we've agreed on what we were gonna do, and I'm not gonna try to persuade her to do anything else. Previously something to do with that exercise class - I believe just watching it - I don't know whether I've been participating with this one or not. The one I'm seeing is a very large group of women rehearsing some kind of dance routine. I suppose it must be an exercise routine because that's what they're there for but it really is, as much as anything, a dance routine. It's rather complicated - they've just run through the last few bits, finished up with a difficult maneuver, it ends up in a kind of lunge-squat, and I'm thinking that would be very hard for me. They decide - somebody decides - they should they should vote on it, whether or not to keep this piece in the routine or not, because it is rather difficult. They decide as a majority that they will keep it in, but I can see that some part of the group thinks its too difficult (or looks as though they think it is). They're divided - there're 2 groups, one in the front, and a kind of aisle, and I don't know if they divided up intentionally that way, or why there's a partition, but there just is. (597 words)

I'm downtown at the library - they're having a birthday party for me, it seems like, and we're just finishing up - people are milling around chatting with each other. There's sweets all over the place and I have just met this young man - he's probably in his 20's, somewhat good-looking, I like him, he's fun - reminds me a good bit of Russ. He's wanting to know a good place to go and eat lunch. Someone has suggested to him a restaurant just outside of downtown (which I don't hear named but it appears they're talking about the Dixie) and he needs to know how to get there. I start to tell him only I'm not doing too well at it verbally, so I want a map. I look around and what I find is some sketchy little map that shows you downtown but not the individual streets. I despair of showing him on that - we're just not getting very far. I decide I'd better find a Mapsco - can't find the one that's supposed to be around here, so I go and get the one in my car. People are around; some are taking home their leftovers and some handing them to me, so I've got like a box with leftover cookies in it, and bits of pie and cake and whatnot. We're still having a conversation along the way and I'm thinking I quite like him - I've been in this situation before, where here's a nice young man, that I might actually be flirting with and want to have a relationship with - if I was (a) younger and (b) slimmer, and surprised that he's being as chatty as he is, and wondering if he does have something on his mind - which would surprise me, but you know the behavior is there. And he's trying to have a conversation with me while other people are trying to chat with me as well and we meet them on the way out. Now, the car is in a garage in the back yard - of course the library has no back yard, but now they do, and it's sunny outside. There's hedges all around - the situation is very much like a Sunday after church in summer. So: I am needing to get somewhere eventually, but also wanting to talk to this guy. There's an appointment I need to get to - I get in the car & fetch out the Mapsco and put the stuff I'm carrying on the dashboard. I start to show him where it is - he's looking a bit impatient with me, and finally in a kind of frustration he's yanking me aside and saying, "Look, I want to sleep with you" - which was kind of abrupt but, well, gets the point across - and then I'm astonished, of course, & have no idea what to say to him. So we go back inside and talk some more sitting on the floor in front of some chairs. There's other people sort of casually about - it's more like somebody's living room now, and there's a book under the chair I'm sitting in front of and I can see it suddenly. I realize it's something I had been missing and needed to take with me wherever it is that I'm going. So I do - I decide that it's time I went, so I get my book and my other stuff & go on. I'm going to a psychotherapist's office I guess - she seems to be a psychotherapist in the way she behaves (I'm not sure that the whole situation is that way) and I am like half an hour late or more, and she's kind of reluctant to even see me because after all I've barely got time to even get started before she's got another client - but I sit there and we talk anyway. I seem to have a problem - a specific problem that needs addressing - it's hard to say whether it's serious or not from this vantage point - but she is certainly taking it seriously, and I seem not to be taking it seriously since after all, I'm this late.

I am watching TV early in the morning with my brother - watching Howard Stern. It's a TV version of his regular morning studio radio show, and he is just having discussions with people around in the office and there's a portion where there's barely anybody visible on the screen. My brother and I are occasionally having a conversation (not my real brother, by the way - bears some resemblance to the actor Robert Hayes - younger I suppose) - I'm in school and I think he is too. But for some reason he isn't going today. I'm supposed to go, and the later it gets the more at risk I am of being late. Bonnie is our mother - she's in another room, when the phone rings. I am supposed to be getting ready for school and it occurs to me that I'd better start moving. She comes back and says she has to go to - maybe it's the hospital - there is someone she knows in trouble and she has to go and help out somehow and I am asking if it's somebody I know - [she says a first name I don't remember right now] - she says, "I have go right now" - anyhow she's not answering the question. Seems kind of distracted, definitely quite worried - whatever is going on, it's very serious - I keep after her for several tries - ["somebody"] who? - is it the one I know? Do I know this person? "Can I help?" obviously is what I mean - and she eventually says, "No, I don't think you do know her", and I say, "Well okay, but I just wanted to know." She goes (now I'm thinking Bonnie is my grandmother maybe) - meanwhile I go into the bathroom. The object is, I need to get ready for school - I've looked at the clock - or a clock, and discovered it's 10 in the morning - I'm really startled - school starts at 8, and the TV - well, the show goes on all morning, I'm thinking, "Surely I haven't just sat and stared at the TV this long!" I look at another clock, and it says 8 o'clock, which is bad enough, but how could the clocks be at 2 different hours? This is terrible! I had better get to school anyhow - this has really got me upset. I've never done anything like this before - certainly I may have been late some places before, but nothing like this, and at school they're gonna think that I've cut or something. This is terrible. But I go into the bathroom and there's stuff, everywhere that I want to use - the bathtub has something in it, some kind of cloth or maybe a shower curtain or something - the sink has corn on the cob in it - not whole pieces, small chunks - and that is just disgusting. (There's something else - I don't know if there's 2 sinks but there's something else I wanted to use that's clogged up with something.) I'mjust outraged and I know that my brother is responsible for at least the sink, because it's his stuff, and I think the bathtub too, and somebody else has left the other stuff and I am wanting to get this fixed up right now. I do not wish to do it myself - it's not my mess. I know I can't ask Bonnie to do it, and my brother - geez - he's a lazy bum himself. So I sort of throw my hands up for a while. Then I realize I can't remember my class schedule. I'm always late, but it seems like I haven't been in school in days and I can't remember what class comes when. This is really weird and disconcerting, and I know that when I get to school I can stop in the principal's office and ask where I'm supposed to be. But this is already just too weird a morning for me to handle already. I'm mad at my brother and even sort of mad at Bonnie, and I just don't know what to make of anything. Outside some people are arriving - I think they're my parents - and some other people, family - and I've gone outside - getting to be on my way to school - and I've stopped to greet them. My brother has for some reason shrunk very small and fallen into a drain hole - not a gutter, it's a round hole in the sidewalk and there's water rushing, rushing, rushing, underneath it. It's kind of as though he shrinks as he falls, really. I have a little vindictive pleasure at seeing him fall in there but at the same time, well, he's my brother, and he's going to get swept away and possibly killed, even, if I let him stay there. But he hangs on to something for a bit and I reach in and grab his legs and then pick him up kind of like a doll with my other hand behind his back and pull him back out again. (851 words)

I'm in the library, just arriving (later in the day - maybe back from lunch or a trip) - it's pretty busy, lots of people in - I notice Ramon checking out. I go into the back room and check who's there. We have a number of people helping us out because we're so shorthanded, people from other branches and downtown. Most are taking breaks, sitting on the floor against the wall - it's a long room, dark with only the oblique afternoon light coming from the wall of windows at the far end. Everybody's in that sort of half-shadow - not dark enough to not be able to see, but not light enough to see clearly. I count heads, and exchange a few words, making sure everybody's okay and we're covered on the desk. I don't want us to get exhausted, and it can be a near thing. I go on into the next room, where there's another workroom. I go back there and [lost - do some stuff, notice the clock, something's wrong with it, it's been moved or it's broken or both] - I have to go out front and check out. But VK's taken away the checkout stand! Why in the world would he do that? Didn't he realize we need it? I have to improvise - quickly I grab a nearby lectern, brown wood, not real sturdy, but it'll have to do. Now I have to gather up circ. forms and so on. In a couple of minutes I'm checking out okay, just making do, but later when I get time I'll have to get things better organized. (253 words)

I'm in the Business Office, watching Bonnie in another room - she's been called to some kind of meeting and someone is talking. There's a lot of other folks there too, and I can't easily slip in and tell her I'm going out to the drugstore for the rest of my lunch hour. (They're not for the most part sitting around a table or anything, she's sort of perched on a desk and a lot of people are standing up.) A storm is coming up outside and I figure it's now or never, so I get up as close as I can and wave at her. She looks around and I quickly stage-whisper. She says okay, and this other guy from the office says he'll go with me (did Bonnie suggest it?). I don't really want him to, he'll only slow me down - I only have 10 minutes left, and I've been getting antsy about it. [Note: I'm aware in the dream that I really can't make it in 10 minutes, but- I ignore it and try to pretend.] As we're putting our coats on, the storm is increasing, huge claps of thunder and incredible winds. It's pretty stupid to go out there but I'm determined to get away. We're putting on big trench coats like big-business city people - and we're in an office that has old-style metal desks and file cabinets, blinds on the windows, it's a fairly small place. There are swinging doors up at the head - that's where Bonnie went through to the meeting. We're on bicycles now, and we're not going to a drugstore after all, but an antique-restoration place. There's four of us: me, Jenny, Heather, and the guy - unless he's a totally different guy, he's more of a pal now, and he's black now. Tall. We're in the antique place. It's cramped in this little room, with a high yellow light and a cluttered counter. The repairman is middleaged, got some white hair, friendly but quiet. Jenny has brought a piece to him, it's brass or bronze, has pieces [maybe it's a clock]. He examines it, thinking, nods his head, takes it into an adjacent workroom. We chat while we wait, and Heather is looking at something she has with her, a thing with pieces, some of which are pressed glass, a light blue. I take a piece of it to look at, and it's cracked, which surprises me. [This thing may be some kind of lantern.] I say this guy might be able to repair it - there's some other damage - why don't you ask him? She says she might, and I'm thinking of the time too - we need to get back to work. Now we're all back on our bikes, going back a different way than we came, and I'm concerned about it - I hope we don't get lost, or it doesn't take twice as long. We're going down residential streets, very nice, tall trees on each side, mostly shaded from the branches overhead, nice houses. We chat as we ride along, we're having a good time. We come to some stores and/or a restaurant. We ride by the side of one, on the sidewalk, and I'm carefully going around the corner when I see a little boy on a little bike, he's just starting off with a sister and Mom (I'm not sure if Mom's on a bike), and as I go right by him he starts to fall over. He reaches out in a bit of panic, and I grab him just as he's going forward and the bike can't be stopped. [He's probably about 7 - shorts, flowered short-sleeved shirt, sneakers, blonde hair, nice-looking.] I've got his arm, and even though I can't prevent him falling down, I'm easing him down so he doesn't go splat. The bike falls on him, on his rear, but it's not heavy, so it's not doing any damage. I pluck it off of him with my other hand (I'm still straddling my bike) and set it off to the side, then I give him support to stand up. He seems a little surprised, but none the worse for wear. Relieved. His mother says he should thank me, which he does nicely, and I say I'm glad I could help (or some such thing), very cheery, and we pedal on. The incident is reminding me of something, and suddenly I remember we're not wearing helmets. I point this out to the others, saying we might to be careful. (Of course, none of us thought to wear a helmet because we don't care about them, but they did pass that city ordinance. Now I'm self-conscious.) 
       We're still in the neighborhood, and we come to a corner where a group of people are outside, all dressed up in costumes - mostly fanciful, like SCA or fantasy - one girl seems to be Morticia Addams-like. There's something like a garage sale going on [though I think it's more than that], and we know a few of these people somewhat, so we stop and talk to them. Inside, Jenny's met up with somebody she knows well, and she's hitching a lift back with him. (It seems to be Mel Torme - he's here, but she hasn't said it was him.) [There are big tables in here, piled with big things like maybe carpet rolls or something. It's a bit musty and there's a yellow light, as from a single bulb. Warm.] I say, "You don't want to ride with us on such a nice day?" - I've been teasing her for some time about keeping up the pace, are we going too fast for you?, etc. She says, "I'm a needy smoker - I've got to have a cigarette". We all laugh, tease a little more, we plan our next route. (897 words)

I'm on a little trip out of town, trying to get hold of four papers - some sort of legal documents from the city or county or something, that this little lawyer says I need. I've come with somebody (or he/she's come with me, for the ride), but I've sent (him/her) along while I look for the right office in this building. So I get there and apply for the things I need. The clerk comes back with two of them, and says the other two are back in the city. I roll my eyes - of course the little lawyer told me that I'd have to come all the way here for all of them. What a nuisance. I go back and pick up my stuff, and aim for the exit door that leads to the parking lot. Then I hesitate, thinking that I might make better time if I go the other way down the interior hallway. I start that way, stop again, change my mind again and go the other way. Whle we were travelling up here, I kept thinking about getting to a coffee house somewhere. I'd been looking forward to that more than finding the courthouse and getting these papers. Now, since we found the courthouse first and I've gotta go right back now, heaven knows when I'm gonna get any coffee. Nuts. 
       The papers I got seem to be some sort of maps, which show the location of some family property, near. The lawyer's office even shows up - not as such, but I'm pointing out its site to somebody. (267 words)

I'm looking for a place to live in another town. I don't know where the best areas are, but I'm visiting with some people who can help me look. There's a girl who knows electricity and building - she does something with it for a living - and she helps me examine a place that looks pretty junky. The LT community meetings are being held (outdoors?) under some trees, and I've come early. John Larroquette is here and trying to get a young guy to get up on an elephant - it's kind of a prank, he knows it's hard and he'll have an even harder time getting down. It is pretty funny. He's right in front of me, and swinging around pretty wild, so I get up and move back a bit. He ends up on the elephant, but facing backwards. Oh, boy. Folks start to show up, and I remember I need to tell Grace that I made the phone calls I was supposed to make - I'm way behind. I'm staying in a little, dark apartment with a guy, and another man has just come to stay briefly. We're having a conversation, rather quiet; I'm showing him where things are. I'm getting ready to go somewhere and haven't got all my clothes on, which is usually okay, but I don't know if he's uncomfortable with it, so I mention it to him. It's a little awkward, and I get a little self-conscious. I actually think about what it might be like to have him touch me, as if it might help. (264 words)

I'm in another city. It's very different, old, sort of European, there are big old buildings and bridges and levels. Someone else is driving, we're crossing a wide street, maybe 4 lanes and as we pass I see a couple of cars heading straight for each other, head-on. I think the one facing away from us is going the wrong way, since it's on the left half of the street - but the oncoming car evades it, and as they clear the lane I can see the arrows, and it was the oncoming car [which was] in a lane marked for the other direction, after all - there's just one oncoming lane. He was lucky. We come to the place I'm staying, with a family, and we decide to go out for a little excursion, still downtown. We drive past a big open space created by the building (no windows, but probably the back of a big department store) and a wide pavement, kind of a mall. There are benches built into the wall and lots of people about, visiting, strolling. There's yellow street light, enough so there are no dark spaces, but not bright. The building wall recedes in places, to form a big alcove. We've gone around various streets and you can see they're not flat - this area goes up and down a lot, it adds to the interest. We stopped and got out to stroll and we're passing a bakery/restaurant, as we walk up into a sort of covered mall. The window is sort of a long bay, leading around inside, and there are wonderful, fancy, hearty breads displayed. One of them looks to me like a tomato bread - dark with a reddish cast. It's a huge round domed loaf with a chunk cut out to show the inside, like some others in the window. I've stopped to admire, and the others gather round. The daughter is next to me, pointing at various ones, and I peer closer at the "tomato" bread, thinking maybe it isn't that, but it sure looks good. We agree we have to stop in here, maybe eat something - it seems very cheerful [very European-cosmopolitan] inside. It looks as though they sell the breads by the pound, we should get some to take home too. (381 words)

Dana Scully is pushing a shopping cart up to a house on a very nice street with old, large brick houses built on a rise - it's gray out. She's hurrying, and a young man is following, he can't quite keep up with her, although he's the one that invited her to come along with him. She goes right up to the house purposefully, and on in, he follows. [She's just going to stay for a bit and then go home - she makes a phone call to let somebody know where she is?] I'm in a house with Candace Bergen (her house? our house?) - I'm sort of her assistant. She's expecting a famous doctor and we're just getting ready, refreshments and that, and I'm a bit flustered, nervous [as if I haven't done this long, or don't do it well...]. There's somebody at the door, and I open it. It's a guy in a suit (balding, glasses, tall, bit of a dork), and I say hello, Dr., [please come in? fading - we discover he's not the right one, perhaps after he comes in, it's awkward.] Another knock - I go again, and it's another guy in a suit, gray wavy hair, handsomeish, tall. I've forgotten his name - I say, "Yes?" - hoping he'll say, "Hello, I'm Dr. ____" so I can respond to that, but he doesn't, he says [something like], "Hello, is Miss Bergen in?" and I say a name that pops into my head - which isn't the right one, and there's confusion, but at least we get him in, and there we all are including this other guy who's a fifth wheel. I'm in a house with (Sue S.? someone who is a bit older, in charge, sort of mother, sort of leader) - there's a bunch of other girls here, we're a group. I have my own room, off the kitchen, where (she) is. [Something's going on that's faded, but I'm feeling small and vulnerable, the room is a bit more than daytime-dark, it's shadowy. There's hesitance about getting something done. Something specific about clothes tossed on a little chair in the corner next to the door.] Later, there's a trial going on. In the kitchen, (she) is questioning someone - the lights are on bright there. Around the counter/bar, there's me and a few others. We're the "jury", and I'm the only one paying much attention. I'm sitting with another girl, and we occasionally exchange some comments, but across a partition and up a level, there's maybe 4 others at a table, and they're just acting like teenagers (I guess we all are) and gabbing away. It gets to where I can't hear the "witness", and I say something like, "Stop talking - no one is hearing what she's saying," which of course is rude but much worse, we're supposed to be taking part in this trial. And it may mean I'm the one who has to make the decision because I'm the only one who heard the evidence. (409 words)

I'm with some friends outside - maybe at a cafe patio table or something, happy, chatting - a gray day. A bum (or eccentric) comes by (panhandling?) and we exchange a word or two, he goes off. He has a contraption - something on wheels that he pushes along, it's meant to be some sort of vehicle but he's not in it but behind it, with a long "steering" handle-sort-of-thing. He's heading into water just next to us - he thinks the thing will float and he'll travel over it, but obviously it's just junk, and we watch him trundle up to the water (it's very gradual going down), and push the thing forward. Of course it goes further under the water because it's forward [of him], but under it goes. We're wondering if we should be stopping or helping him or what, but someone thinks we should just leave him alone, so we do. [Same place, I think] I'm by myself now, my friends are leaving. One of them is Peggy, who I've just learned is now operating a Metro Diner with James. This is different for them, but very enterprising, and I think I should come see it. I ask where it is, and she gives me some landmarks - it's in a part of town we don't go to much - and she seems just a hair short of welcoming. I have an impression of her and James thinking I'm a hypocrite for being interested in what they do. (It's just an impression.) She really looks good - her hair is longer and waved sort of 40's-50's, sexy, and her face is different, more sophisticated, great makeup, strong character. (277 words)

My memory of this dream is vague. I think the setting is on a college campus. I'm in a cafe and two elderly ladies walk in and start talking to me about a university that a guy I am dating got into for law school. They were saying that I was accepted. I thought that this information was weird because I didn't even apply to this school. I got the feeling that while I was talking to these ladies, that they were interviewing me as art of the orientation to go there. I was also pregnant in the dream and he cafe that I was in was a hospital cafe. The guy I am dating is in the dream and we were talking, but I'm not sure about what. (129 words)

The scene of the dream was the same as the movie The Terminator. It featured my sister and mother and Arnold Schwartzenegger. We are in a neighborhood setting and I am outside playing on the street when a man drives up and asks me for directions and I tell him I am not familiar with the place he is asking about. He says, "But you live around here and you should know." The street he wanted happened to be the street we were on. Then the scene goes to a gym and I am confused about what is going on. Then I see Arnold and a big man with white hair talking at a table. Right before that I see a soap opera star on a nearby TV doing a commercial. My sister is with me and we are talking about the soap opera star. The actress's name is Lisa Rinna and she plays Billie Reed on Days of Our Lives. Then I see another soap star and this time it is an actress from General Hospital who plays Lois Quartermane. She is singing a Beatle's song, "Yesterday." Then I focused on Arnold and the man with white hair. They are in a grocery store that looks like a nightclub. The guy with white hair is referred to as the "Boss" man. He is telling Arnold to do something and Arnold doesn't want to do it. Then the "Boss" man starts to threaten Arnold, so Arnold gives in and does what the "Boss" man requests. Arnold commented on how much he liked Lois's singing and he got up and that's when I saw that one of Arnold's arms is robotic. It looked like he had just gotten into a fight and some of his flesh was peeled off and that's how I could see part of the robot arm. The "Boss" man got up after Arnold left and jumps for joy and starts to run out of the building. A pudgy little waiter or maybe the manager asks before he leaves is there anything more that he wanted. The "Big" man just laughs and says no. Then he runs out of the building. The floor started to shake and it seems like all of the people are going to fall through the floor, but they just vanish. This was a morbid thought for me because they just ceased to exist. The building then blew up, but it was then I saw that all the people have gotten out safely. I got the feeling that Arnold saved all the people that were in the restaurant. (434 words)

I was in a mansion or more like a castle and there was a person who was supposed to be the devil in the castle. He was snapping his fingers and slitting people's throats. I was running away and riding my bike through my neighborhood. Then I arrive at the preschool where I am doing a field study, and I am a teacher and my students and I are playing a name song. When it gets to one of the male volunteers, he leans in and kisses me. I don't recognize his face, but I seem to know him. I have a strong physical attraction to this person and throughout the dream I hope he feels the same way. Then I am with the children again and we are running from some other children who are the devil. The devil looks like someone from Bach's era. He has a wide grin on his malicious-looking face. The children and I are escaping in a jeep, but have to leave the jeep and continue on foot. We are in a jungle now and I lose one of the children, which has me scared, but then I found the child again, alive and well. (201 words)

This dream took place in the water. Two sisters wanted to be mermaids. So they turned into mermaids, but one of the sisters really wanted to have her sister's legs, so she took them. She returned them to their rightful owner after she was done using them. One of my sorority sisters whom I haven't seen in a while was also in my dream. She was telling me she was going to school in another state, and I told her that I had family there. I felt uncomfortable talking to her and I could sense tension between us. We had been taking care of some babies as we were talking and I felt like she didn't like me, or had something against me. (123 words)

The guy that I have been dating was standing in his room naked with one of his housemates who is a girl, and someone whom he has previously slept with. She was lying on the floor, also naked. I walked into the room and as I saw them, they both told me not to worry, that nothing was going on. I believed them and said, "OK," and walked out of the room. (72 words)

I dreamt I was in a dorm room and saying goodbye to someone I had been dating. He was going off to school. In the next scene the room was full of people and then suddenly empty again, except for a pile on the floor in the corner that consisted of a corkboard with old pictures of me on it. This room must have belonged to the guy I was seeing, because I thought it was unusual for him to have these pictures of me. He really liked these pictures, which made me feel like he was really going to miss me, which surprised me. He was trying to kiss me goodbye, but I hesitated because there was a carload of my friends looking at us, and they didn't approve of our relationship. He left and I went back into the room, and it was filled with things all of a sudden. Then my new roommate was there and a strange guy came out of the shower and took off his towel and I got a shocking eye-full. Then I went to my mom's house, where I found my dog; she is actually dead in reality. (196 words)

I was in a back yard and it was raining. The back yard was sectioned off into two parts and the children that attend the preschool that I volunteer at are there. They started running towards a pool and I was struck with fear when I saw what the children were doing. I thought that they would fall into the pool and drown and that it would be my fault. I was afraid for their safety. The children told me it was OK for them to get so close to the pool, but I knew that it wasn't. (98 words)

I was in a city that I didn't recognize and I am with a group of people. I think the group was professional psychologists, but a friend of mine was in the group and it seemed wrong for him to be there. Then the scene changed, and I was in a street and I saw a car that came out of nowhere. I heard screams and I saw a man on the ground in a pool of blood. I saw two people in the car and the one who was driving happened to be a good friend of mine. He was acting like he was drunk and didn't realize what he was doing. Then the scene switched and we watched a person bleeding in a kitchen. I put water onto a handkerchief to stop the blood. I remember arguing with a young girl who wanted to come and see the victim. We said no because we didn't think she could handle it. Then somehow the girl gets outside to see the accident scene and there is no more body. We then started to clean up the blood and a police car that has been wrecked comes out of nowhere to survey the scene. I try to get out of the path of the police car. The car stops and my friend gets out of the car, and the police officer comes running up and arrests him. I am standing there in disbelief. (242 words)

I had a dream that I had a child and had to cancel a test because I had to take care of the baby. I was breast feeding the baby, because it is healthier to breast feed than to give formula from a bottle. The person that I had been seeing wanted to know what I thought I was doing. The question was in an accusatory manner, like I had no business breast feeding my own baby. Then I left the baby with my friends and left. When I came back, they were feeding the baby Tabasco sauce because they ran out of milk. This shocked me because I thought my friends were more responsible than that. (117 words)

I was in a place that I didn't recognize, but the people who were with me were familiar to me. There was a big group standing around a picnic table. My father was talking and saying "thank you" to all the people who comforted me and helped me through the tough times that I was going through. Then a housemate of mine asked if my father had considered her one of the people who helped me. He told her that she only helped me out a little. Since she and I were having problems, I didn't think that was appropriate to say, and I took my dad aside and said that what he said to her didn't help the situation between us. When we went back to the table, I was sure that there was going to be a big confrontation. I was surprised when no confrontation occurred. (148 words)

I was pushing a baby carriage to a meeting at the preschool where I used to volunteer. In the carriage was a girl from the preschool that I used to spend a lot of time with. I felt extremely apprehensive and not sure if I would be welcomed back because I had been gone so long. I then saw the guy that I used to date playing with the kids. I was surprised he was there. Then the scene switched and my two housemates came into a room where a group of people was drinking. A party was going on and my housemates started to yell at some of the people because they were underage and drinking. I had yelled back at them because I was the only one drinking alcohol and I thought they were overreacting to the situation. I told them that they were being really hypocritical, and they just laughed. Then I was in a car with my closest friend at the university and we were going shopping. I just needed to get some groceries. She said, "You get your detergent here." I wanted to go to the grocery store closer to my house rather than the one we were at because it is cheaper. Then I said, "Why don't I just go get the detergent at the other store?" Then she said, "Never mind, we will just go in here, it doesn't matter." Then I had to go to the bathroom. The whole conversation took place in the store parking lot. Then my housemates came by and asked if they went too far when we had our argument before. I said in a calm voice that I thought they did and were being hypocritical. Then they said with a big smile that they were moving out in two weeks. This left me high and dry for a place to live, because I couldn't afford to live on my own. So I replied that I would make arrangements with our current landlords. They were just smiling the whole time like they were happy to stick it to me. (351 words)

I was looking at a mouse with a crowd of people around me. The people seemed familiar to me, but don't exist in real life. We were trying to figure out what to do with the mouse or where I should put it. I suggested my hamster cage. A woman in the group said, "No, the mouse will never fit." I argued, "Yes it will," and I put the mouse in the cage. Then a problem occurred when I saw my hamster. I was afraid that the mouse and hamster would fight and my hamster would be killed. The hamster was in the first compartment of the cage and hadn't seen the mouse yet, but was moving to the part of the cage where the mouse was. I got the mouse out before anything happened to it.

Throughout the dream I had a feeling of urgency. I felt that I was on a deadline to get an assignment done for school. I almost didn't turn the assignment in on time because when going to the campus, I took a wrong turn and ended up in the parking lot of where I went to high school. Then I was trying to get to a house that was supposed to be my house. This is a house that I had never seen before, but I knew it was mine. I'm at the top of the stairs in the house looking down them. Someone had just told me that all of the animals that lived in the house were fighting. The dog that belongs to my housemates was downstairs, but I wasn't sure she was the one who was causing the trouble. Also my two cats were down the stairs and my dog, who is dead, was also there. All the time I was wondering what one of my cats was doing there because I had to give her away, due to the fact that she and my other cat didn't get along. Also I was surprised to see my dog, because she was put to sleep when I was fourteen years old. I had heard these noises of animals fighting when I was outside of the house, so I ran up to see what was going on. I felt that I was in a frantic hurry because I couldn't get up the hill to the house fast enough. I ended up running through the campus to get to the house. When I finally reached the house, I heard a cat screech and I saw lights blinking on and off, like a haunted house. Then my dog ran out of the house, obviously very scared. I noticed she was limping and her leg was bleeding, like she had been bit. I said, "She needs help, she's been bit." I figured my housemate's dog had been the one to bite her. After I saw my dog, I ended up in the house somehow. (352 words)

I was in a big, open space and the sky was weird cloudy blue. The sky looked like something right out of a science fiction movie. I was in a gigantic pool of water, collecting donation money for a philanthropy I was working on. I was expecting a lot more money than I received, but I collected well over fifty dollars, which surprised me. Then I was on dry land and celebrity Tim Robbins and my closest friend at the university and some other woman were there. Tim Robbins was squatting because he was so tall. We were standing around in hopes they would give us some money. (108 words)

I felt that this dream was the same setting as the last dream, just a different scenario, and I woke up in between the two dreams. I was dealing with a confrontation between my housemates and myself. We were on an outside porch. Both of my housemates were standing on the porch, and I was on the driveway looking up at them. It was a Victorian style house. The female housemate was upset with me and I didn't understand what I did wrong. She felt I did something to deliberately hurt her. What I did was never clear. She was yelling at me and saying that I never cared about her and she never loved me. I responded by saying she was a hypocrite and a fake and I thought she was selfish and self-centered. Then I went walking towards the house and found a present on the front porch and opened it. It was the game Perfection. I left and came back again and the gift was wrapped up again, but then I noticed an antique wicker bassinet holding the game. Then I sat on the porch holding a baby, talking about what was happening between my housemate and me. (201 words)

I was walking down a path and on both sides of the path were sand dunes. I was walking with two people and it looked like we were trying to find a place to sit. I knew ahead of time that once we found a place to sit that I would leave the two people I was walking with. I was just dropping them off, I guess. As we walked down the path, I noticed a lot of people sunbathing on the sand dunes. I commented to the people I was walking with that as we went down the path, the bathing suits I saw the women wearing were getting weirder and weirder. I said, "People are just using them for show and not to swim in." During the walk I didn't recognize the people I was walking with, but when we reached our destination, I recognized the mom as TV star Roseanne Barr and I was also walking with a little girl. As soon as we found a pot to sit, I left. (174 words)

This second dream is a continuance of the first dream. After I left the beach, I was inside of a house that I didn't recognize with two ex-housemates of mine. One of them is male and the other a female, and they were dating at the time I was living with them. I was in a large room, a spacious main room, when a big buff biker man drove into the house in a car and made a big mess. I had a feeling that he was my boyfriend, but I had never seen him before. Then I saw the car being destroyed and the room along with it. I noticed a hubcap turn into a blade on a circular saw and go crashing into the left side of the wall. From where I was standing in the room I was facing the car and the destruction. Half of the blade was stuck inside of the wall and half was sticking out. Then I seemed to replay the dream again; it was the same as before, but went a little further, like a movie. The crash happened like before, but this time the blade went flying through the air. It barely missed hitting my friend, the girl who I used to live with. Then her boyfriend and the guy I used to live with said to me in a calm voice as he was cleaning up the mess the blade left in the wall, "You have to have a talk with your boyfriend. It's not good for us to keep cleaning up after he crashes his car in our house." I agreed with him and then turned around and the biker guy was there and went up to the guy I lived with and said he was sorry that he crashed into our house and wouldn't do it again. Then the biker guy helped fix the damage done to the wall. When the biker guy and my ex-male roommate were plastering up the wall, it started to have an unusual look to me. It looked like they were putting puzzle pieces back onto the wall. (355 words)

I was driving on a freeway with my boyfriend and then suddenly I was at home feeling tense because I was listening to the messages on my answering machine and there was one from my father, wondering where I was because I was supposed to meet him. It was Easter Sunday and I was supposed to go and visit my parents. I had other things to do and couldn't go, and I was upset because I didn't want to have to explain my actions to my father. So I ended up yelling at my father over the phone because he didn't understand my position. Then all of a sudden I was in an apartment with all the female cast of "Mad About You." I was watching Helen Hunt (Jamie) running around looking for something, and her sister-in-law on the show found a gun in a cabinet and all the women in the room turn on Helen Hunt (Jamie), telling her she was a bad mother for keeping a gun around her newborn baby. Then Helen went outside and stood in the front of her apartment building in the dark, when a man came up to her to see what she was doing. (202 words)

I was on a tour bus with a group of people. We were driving on a mountain road. It seemed that we were in Hawaii or the Caribbean. The bus was going fast and out of control. Then I looked around and saw that my group was no longer on the bus. It seemed they sneaked off. The bus hadn't slowed down, so I didn't notice the group was gone until I looked out the rear window and saw them on the side of the road while the bus sped on. There was a young girl on the bus who seemed equally confused. She was either Hawaiian or of Asian descent. I couldn't tell. Then the bus driver, a man, turned around and laughed maliciously, like he wasn't going to stop the bus or crash. Finally we came to a narrow cobblestone street, and I grabbed the girl by the hand and jumped off the bus. She did something afterward. I think she thanked me and started to eat something. I was confused as to where she got the food. Then I started to retrace the bus's route to find the rest of my group. (195 words)

I was in the downtown of my home town and I was supposed to meet my boyfriend. I was driving around and saw his car parked outside of a movie theater I used to go to. I thought that this was strange because he isn't used to this city. (49 words)

It was my graduation day and I was at the ceremony. We (the graduates) were getting ready to get our diplomas. We got up from our seats and went to the back of an auditorium. We skipped to the rear door leading outside. We were lining up and I was supposed to go first. I didn't know it because I hadn't attended any of the graduation practices. I was surrounded by my friends who were also graduating, but they had graduated a year or two before me. So I was the first one to walk down the aisle. They gave me a piece of thick white rope that everyone carried a piece of to link the graduates together. My father was seated at the back of the auditorium so he could see me right as I walked in. When I started walking down the aisle, my father grabbed me by the arm. I was startled. Then he followed me up to the front of the auditorium saying that I had to come with him. I tried to tell him that I was in the middle of something and I couldn't. I hadn't even gotten my diploma yet. He got upset and started to lecture me about not listening to him, and said that he was trying to give me something and I should pay more attention to him. So I went up to the stage and got my diploma, went back to my seat, which was in the front row. I put down the end of my rope on my seat and went to see what he wanted. I was upset because I wasn't able to see my friends graduate. My dad gave me my graduation gift. He gave me a piece of paper that told me what my graduation gift was. All I read was Theta Chi Theta, Spring and the word Baseball. There was more, but it was just scribble and I couldn't make it out. The gift was a season pass to watch a baseball game. Then the paper turned into glass and the writing rubbed off. I saw my mom, sister and Aunt Ellen (she is deceased) on a hill by my dorms, and asked if they saw me graduate. They said they slept through it and thought they could catch me. I was angry with them. Then I went back into the auditorium and saw my friends sitting and crying about graduation and even some people I didn't know were crying with them. I told one woman not to cry about getting an education. Then I went back to an almost empty apartment and was waiting for people to show up for a party. There was a strange golden-coated dog in my kitchen. There wasn't much furniture in the house for people to sit on. I was feeling disappointed about how the day went. (479 words)

I was in a room with a long table in it. There were mirrors and paintings on the walls that I was facing. It was either a dining room or a banquet room in a restaurant. I was at a fancy party, but felt out of place. I felt I was trying to find shoes to match my dress. Then I walked into the parking lot and saw two characters from the TF show "Wings." The brothers Joe and Brian were having a fight. Joe was with a girl telling Brian that he had to move out because Joe didn't have enough privacy. Brian was hurt and said, "Fine, I will just move back to Connecticut or New York." Joe told Brian that he didn't have to move that far away, but Brian said it was too expensive to live in the West by himself. I was watching the scene as if I was Brian, watching my boyfriend leaving me for another woman. I was feeling extremely bad. Then I went to place like Costco and this child, a little girl, about one or two years old came running up to me and sat on my lap and gave me a hug and kiss. Then she went back to her mother and sat in the top part of a shopping cart full of merchandise. All of a sudden I was overwhelmingly happy. Then I spent some time looking around the warehouse. I saw a lot of half-priced Halloween merchandise that was on sale. Most of it was candy. I remember seeing glow-in-the-dark candy ghosts and the child wanted one. I didn't think it was a good idea because I didn't think her mother would approve. Then I went down an aisle that had expensive jewelry, furniture, lamps, and designer rugs, trying to be careful not to break anything. Then I was on a high school campus looking for a friend who said earlier in the dream that she wanted to be a cheerleader, which I thought was very odd. She always made fun of things like that. Anyway, I was looking for her and saw her with some other girls in cheerleader outfits with her hair in pigtails with pom-poms. She then gave me a schedule of games to go to and I left very confused as to what just happened. I felt something wasn't right about my friend wanting to be a cheerleader, but at the same time I wanted to support her. I still couldn't understand why my friend wanted to be a college cheerleader.

I was in a hallway with a lot of doors. It looked like the hallway of the elementary school that I went to, which looked as if it had been remodeled My friend who attended that school with me was in my dream. She and her husband were on the other side of one of the clouded glass doors making blowfish faces at me. I thought that was out of character for my friend. Then I was getting my car fixed and another friend of mine from high school wanted to give me a deal on my car. Then I suddenly appeared in a bedroom with my sister in it. She was in bed trying to sleep, but couldn't because an alarm kept going off. She told me the alarm was going off because she was using sheets that didn't belong to her. Then I was outside on the campus and two women staff members came up to me and said it is good that I am in the new program because if I was in the old one, it would be twice as hard for me to graduate.

I went to a restaurant that had a billiard room in it to meet one of my boyfriend's friends from his soccer team. This restaurant was a place that my boyfriend was working at in the dream. My boyfriend saw me and asked what I was doing there, and I said that I was here to meet his friend to play pool. My boyfriend told me to wait a minute and he would join us because he was just getting finished with work. I said OK, but I felt disappointed because I wanted to do something by myself. I was always waiting for him to be free to go out and at that moment I wanted him to wait for me. (121 words)

I was in a house with an upstairs and a downstairs. It belonged to my boyfriend and myself. This was a house that I didn't recognize the house. My boyfriend and I were cuddling and laughing upstairs when we heard noises downstairs. Both of my boyfriend's ex-wives were staying with us as guests. Wife number one in the dream is really wife number two in real life and wife number two in the dream is someone I had never seen before. I went downstairs and saw his first (dream) wife. I was surprised that she spent the night in our house. She was folding up some blankets and wanted to talk to me and ask me a favor. I got the impression that she wanted to spend some time alone with me to get better acquainted. This surprised me because I have never met her and I know she doesn't like me. So I told her I would make time for her. Then I left her in the family room and went down the hall into another guestroom. I saw my boyfriend with his second (dream) wife. Her name was the same as his actual second wife. She also talked with the same regional accent, but had blonde hair like his first wife in the real world. When I walked into the room, she was drying off. I think she had just taken a shower. As she was drying her hair, she looked up and saw my boyfriend and draped the towel over her shoulders like a man would do and gave him a hug. I thought it was strange that she didn't have a top on and left the door open while drying her hair. I noticed as I watched this scene that she had pierced nipples and that bothered me more than watching her hug my boyfriend. I left the room and my boyfriend came after me, telling me there was no need to be jealous and then we started to laugh and giggle some more. (338 words)

I walked into a music classroom on the campus and found my professor from last quarter playing one of the musical instruments that he had taught me. I then walked over to him to see if there was a chance that I could be in his class for spring quarter because I had to drop another class and I needed the credits. He didn't answer me; he just continued to play the instrument while smiling at me. (77 words)

I was in my old elementary school and as I was walking through the hallway, I was looking at all of the changes. There was a classroom where the library used to be and a lot of other construction had been done; everything was new and the walls were white. Then the scene changed and I was in an apartment complex living with people I didn't know. I was waiting for my boyfriend, who was with his family. Then I went to a secret passageway that led to the inside of my apartment and I saw a note addressed to Boom. The note said that his family couldn't keep up with him and got lost while following him to the room. Boom was supposed to be my boyfriend's nickname in the dream. At the end of the dream my boyfriend and I were reunited with his family. (147 words)

I was at a theme park and I think it was supposed to be Disneyland. I remember being extremely excited to be there. I was with my sister and couldn't wait to go on the rides. My sister dragged me to what was a huge slide. I thought that it was boring for a ride at Disneyland. I asked, "Why are we waiting in line to go on something so boring?" All the time I was in line for the slide, I was looking at all the other more exciting rides we could have been going on. (97 words)

It was the beginning of a new quarter and I was taking a bus or shuttle to campus. I was pregnant and I knew that I was supposed to give birth after my first day of classes. It turned out that I gave birth on the bus to a baby girl. Knowing that I had to go to my classes, I took my baby to daycare only a few hours old. Then I went to my classes and by the end of the day, when I went to pick my baby up, she was crawling around the daycare room. The room looked like one in a house, not a school. I couldn't believe she was crawling because she was only four hours old. I went to pick her up to cuddle her, and she crawled away from me like we were playing a chase game. The daycare worker commented on how fast she is when she crawls. "I could barely catch her," she said. When I was holding my baby in my arms, I felt so happy because I had been waiting so long to hold her. I wanted to name her Angelica, but couldn't name her because I had to wait for her father to come for us so he could name her too. (215 words)

I was in a cafe and a bartender friend of mine, one who works with my boyfriend, gave me a rose bud. He actually put it into what seemed to be a creamer picture. He told me not to worry and walked off. I was sitting at the table putting on green nail polish. I wasn't worried about taking up a table because the place was empty and I knew the owner. The tables had table cloths on them and candles. I looked down and saw glass cuttings covering the tablecloths, like the tables in a restaurant I used to work in. The owner of this restaurant used to be the manager of the cafeteria in my high school and I used to work for him. (126 words)

I was in a place that I didn't know. The oldest brother on the television show, "A Party of Five," was pursuing me. His name is Charlie. He knew I was unhappy in my current relationship and wanted me to leave my boyfriend. I was hesitant because I still loved my boyfriend and I didn't want to leave him to start a new relationship with someone else. There was also a slimy-looking guy who was also pursuing me and I had no interest in him whatsoever. I didn't know how to tell him to back off, so he just kept pestering me. I was running in a race in which I came in second. I felt all right about my performance, but I also thought that I could do better. Right after a race I went into a room to be alone and then the slimy guy followed me into the room and cornered me. That's when Charlie came in and put his arms around me in a protecting way and told the other guy to get lost. Then my boyfriend came in and just when I was going to try to explain what was happening, I woke up, ending the dream with my boyfriend and I standing face to face. (211 words)

I was doing an experiment and I was trying to describe what I was doing on a paper. Then I was in a computer room with my sister and mother taking a class. The dream bounced around a lot. I was outside talking to friends; they were people I didn't know, but I had a sense they were my friends. I had lost my keys and was talking on the phone for a long time to one of my partners in my perception lab group. Then I went into a store with an old high school friend looking at sorority paraphernalia. I didn't see anything I liked, so I went to another store I knew of that carried sorority merchandise. When I walked in, I saw a lot of formal dresses and the store seemed empty; no one was in sight. Then all of a sudden I see the owner of the store run from a bathroom across the hall to another room naked. I looked away a little shocked. She poked her head around the door and said, "I'll be right with you." I went into another room to look through the shirts and T-shirts. I was folding up a sweatshirt and putting it back when the lady scolded me for folding the shirt the wrong way. So I felt the need to hurry and get what I wanted from the store to get out of there. Then I saw my best friend from high school buying something, which relaxed me. (252 words)

I was with a male friend flying a jet plane and landing it, because something was wrong with the plane. He wasn't supposed to be landing his plane. I felt that he wasn't supposed to be in my dream. Then I was with my boyfriend and we were walking around outside in a park, when we saw a mother with her two children holding pictures of my boyfriend playing soccer. The unusual thing about this scene was the pictures were in motion like a video picture. The baby was controlling the speed at which the video was going and my boyfriend was acting extremely goofy in the pictures with his soccer buddies. Then we went downtown and I was supposed to meet him at a bar. Then all of a sudden he came into the bar I was in with a girl with long blonde hair. She was allover him and he looked like he was enjoying it. Then I came over and he left her at once to be with me. (172 words)

I was at some sort of show where Elvis Presley was singing and also making drawings on poster paper. I wanted to get a picture for my boyfriend as a memento because he likes Elvis so much. The drawing that was at my table had gotten wet and I had to throw it away. So I went over to Elvis and asked him to draw something else so I could give it to my boyfriend. He tore off a piece of paper and wrote something on it. All I could read was, "To my good Buddy." ...Then he invited me to his apartment later. I was walking around an apartment complex to find out where he lived. I stopped and asked two men who were standing around talking which apartment was Elvis's? They told me the apartment number and I went up to the door and knocked. My best friend from high school opened the door and I was a little surprised because she is married to someone else. She said she left her husband for Elvis. When I asked her why, she said, "But this is Elvis Presley." I could see her point. Then I was in another apartment where I was getting a Christmas gift from someone I was supposed to be working with. It was a film advancer. While he was showing me how to use it, he broke the film that was in it. Then he and I tried to fix the film so that it could be used. Then I was with one of my ex-housemates and one of our sorority sisters. We were talking about going shopping for groceries and we talked about how this guy that I work with is a real player. We were also talking about one of our other sorority sisters, but I'm not sure why. Then I was back in the apartment with the guy that I work with when Heather Locklear entered the room and he took my gift from me and gave it to her. She smiles wickedly and throws the gift back at him sort of wrapping it around his head. So then he tried to give me back the gift. I didn't care that he tried to give the gift away after giving it to me because I had no feelings for him whatsoever. I took the gift back because I happened to like it to begin with. Then I was in a lecture and a guy from my perception lab group comes in and sits down next to me. He doesn't look like he usually does. There is a really annoying older woman sitting in the front of the class who is taking up all of the professor's time. I comment to my group member about this lady's annoying behavior. Then she stops talking and looks over at me. (475 words)

I was in an apartment that belonged to a group of my friends. I was talking about my class schedule and one of my friends was saying that I didn't register correctly for a class that is worth two units. He suggested I go and check it out. I said, "It is too late to do anything about it now. I will just have to wait until the beginning of the quarter to get it fixed because I have to go to a specific office for the people in the registrar's office to help me." Then I was in a downtown bar, and someone I used to hang out with was there and his hair was wet. That's why he looked unfamiliar to me when I first looked at him. He was drunk and draping his arm over my shoulder, telling me he hadn't seen me in the longest time and I should come over to his apartment and hang out with him. The rest of the dream involves me trying to get to his house and having a bunch of obstacles preventing me from doing so. Finally I get to the house. (193 words)

I was driving into a store parking lot and parked my car into a handicapped space right next to a black truck. There were two people inside the truck. One of the people was a male and the other one was female. The girl seemed to be in her early adolescence. After I parked I got out of the car, and then turned around. I see the two people who were in the truck get out of the truck and open the passenger side door to my car and get into my car. The guy was behind the driver's seat and the girl was in the passenger seat, just as they were in the truck. Then I opened the driver's side front door and yanked the guy out of my seat. I was extremely angry that someone would invade my space. I then locked my door and the girl locked her door so the guy couldn't get back in, and I knew then that I could trust her. Then when we drove out of the parking lot, I could see the guy she was with chasing us and with him was another male chasing us. The newest male was the girl's boyfriend. So these two guys chased us throughout my dream. I felt they were going to rape us, but I wasn't scared because they didn't seem like much of a threat. Then the girl and I came to a bridge. I was looking at the lake below the bridge and I was thinking that I would rather jump off the bridge and risk the fall rather than being caught by these two guys. The fall made me think of the one Harrison Ford took from a storm drain in the movie, "The Fugitive." All of a sudden it started to rain and the bridge was filling with water and I was wading through it. I felt like I was going in slow motion and was worried that these guys could catch up to me more quickly. There were a lot of people surrounding me, sailing boats and relaxing. Then the first guy I encountered came up to me and grabbed me so I wouldn't jump off the bridge. He said not to worry, that he wouldn't hurt me. Someone had hired him to chase me so that I would have some adventure in my life. (396 words)

I was away from home at college and my dad called me and said that he and I were going skiing for the weekend and told me to be ready by the time he comes to pick me up. I didn't want to go because I was busy and didn't have the time, but I didn't want to say no to my dad. After the conversation I find that I am walking in a crowd. I think I am at a food court in an amusement park and I see a teacher. I don't know who this person is, but I know that he is a teacher. I point at him and said that I know he is a vampire. It is daylight out so it is odd that a vampire would be out in daylight. I am suddenly in the bathroom of a house and the vampire jumps out at me. So I put him into an x-ray machine and go into the other room and turn it on so that the vampire would die. I thought the radiation would kill him. So I went back into the bathroom to see if the vampire was dead, but then he came out of the shower and grabs me. He is about to bite my neck and make me a vampire when I notice that this vampire is my boyfriend. I told him not to make me a vampire until I've graduated from college. He said OK. Then my father called me and said I shouldn't go skiing because the snow was too slushy and I wouldn't have fun. So I went to the beach and then I saw the vampire again and I signaled to him that I knew who he was and what he was up to. Then my father shows up to my room (a dormitory room) with one day left in the weekend, saying we should go skiing because it just snowed and it would be fun even if it was for just a few hours.

I was in a lecture for my perception class. The professor wasn't my real professor and I thought that was strange. The man who was teaching me in the dream was Japanese. A girl who was sitting next to me is actually in my sociology class. In the dream I have a project due and the rest of my group hasn't shown up. So I get up in front of the class and do the project by myself. I figure that I am done with the project, but the presentation that I just gave was like a trial run and doesn't count towards the final grade. Then the girl seated next to me stands up and gives her presentation. Her group didn't show up either. Then I was at home in my bathroom and I noticed that all of the things that are usually on the counter were in a cabinet underneath the sink. I thought that it was odd that the girl I was sitting next to cleaned the bathroom and I don't even live with her. Then I was back at school in a room that looked like a science museum, but was supposed to be a library .The girl that had given her presentation after mine had come up to me while I was working on my project and said, "You didn't even pay attention when I was doing my presentation at the last class." I said yes I had and told her that her presentation was on photosynthesis. I wasn't really paying attention; I just happened to know what her topic it was. It surprised me that I remembered it.

I was walking around a town that seemed familiar to me, but I had never been there before. Then a woman came up to me and asked me to help her deliver her baby. Someone ran and got her parents. Her mother I recognized from the movie "Titanic" When she came into the room, she was acting silly and out of character. The mother was so relaxed, as if her daughter wasn't having a baby and it was no big deal. I felt a special connection with the baby and mother. When Kate gave birth, the scene changed to a gym full of men and Bill Cosby was one of them. I was trying to find the baby's father. Then the scene switched again and I was holding the baby and it turned out that I might be the mother. I was trying to find the father and in my dream it was the father who had given birth to the baby. The character who is the baby's father changed three times. First it was someone I used to date a couple of years ago, second it was a boy I knew from high school, and third it was John Lauraquette. The first two characters I saw as very irresponsible. When the character changed to John Lauraquette I was in the corner room of a restaurant. Some of my girl friends were there wondering how I could be the mother. I remember having sex with the father, but I never thought that a guy could be pregnant. The father was being cold to me and a girl with blonde hair came up to the father and was flirting with him. Then she came and introduced herself me and I told her my name. I said it kind of off-handedly because I was interested more in the baby. This girl got really angry at the way I answered her and started to pick a fight with me. She started swinging her arms at me. I defended myself but had no desire to fight her. I didn't want to start a scene in a public restaurant. Then she stopped fighting and sat near the baby. The father told the girl I was the baby's mother and even though we didn't like each other, I still had a right to be there. Then she kissed him on the cheek and then a more intimate one on the mouth, just to spite me. I didn't care that they were kissing. I just thought it was tacky, considering they were in a public restaurant. (429 words)

I was in a room where someone was giving birth. It was a character from General Hospital. Carly was receiving a C-section. Two other characters from General Hospital, Alan Quartermane and Monica Quartermane, were giving Carly this operation. These two people happen to hate Carly, so as I watched, I thought it was odd they were doing the operation. Carly asked if her baby was all right and the two doctors said yes, but gave each other side-glances, like they were lying to her. They were planning to kidnap the baby. Then two African-American males were walking around the hospital arguing because they were lost. Whenever I saw these two, they were always walking away from me. They seemed out of place characters, like they were from another TV show and weren't supposed to be on the set of General Hospital. They were overacting the whole time they were in my dream. Then I was in the reception area of a hospital and the receptionist was called away. Then I saw someone tip over a container filled with tarantulas. (179 words)

This dream is a continuation of dream 25. The spiders that were in the container seemed to be alien threats to a compound where I was staying and Carly had the baby. I could see the spiders grow and trample over flies, only leaving lifeless corpses behind. They were sucking the blood right out of them. Then I saw a giant spider, more like a monster, taking a fly and eating it. After it was done, the spider had a human expression on its face. Then I was at the house of my best friend. This house was an unfamiliar house that I didn't recognize as being my friend's house. It was as big as a mansion with a half-circular stairway leading from the upstairs to the main entryway. There was a group with me in the house. I sensed that they were up to no good. All my friends were leaving and I begged them to stay and not leave me alone with these men. Then we were all outside and these men took us hostage and were playing torture games with us. These men were throwing a big red rubber ball into a field, and if we didn't catch it, we would get shot. They threw the ball at me and I missed. I went to retrieve it, but kept on running. The leader caught up to me and backed me up against the wall of a barn and said that if I kissed him I could live. So I kissed him because I didn't want to die, but I felt guilty because I didn't tell him about my boyfriend.

It is a snowy day in my hometown. There are accidents all over. I am driving on the highway and see a truck go up a ramp and over the edge of the bank. Where the road turns to my mother's house, a new turn has been made, but I have to go back and take the old one as I can't get through the new one. In another part of the dream, I am going to different places trying to get a haircut. Then I am at work in the newspaper where I used to work and there is a lunch counter. I need to write an article about myself riding a horse. I thought the article was to be about a cowboy entertainer. AT the lunch counter I get a huge roll and as I am trying to write I go back for a huge piece of cake that has one layer of chocolate and one of white. It is a very tall cake. (166 words)

I hire my brother and Ron (a co-worker) to build an addition on a small house near my Aunts. Ron goes ahead and makes it look like an airplane and it appears it actually will be able to fly. I am not happy at first but then I like the idea only I am concerned my brother will be upset and also I am worried about how to pay for it. I decide to pay Ron $100 a month. He seems happy as he just wants to do it. A lot of people come to see it. I plan an open house with refreshments for when it is done. My husband's former employer is there and some young woman and we talk about the expense of flying an experimental aircraft but I heard of some way to do it cheaper. There is also something about a woman serving Thanksgiving dinner. A little boy comes to her house (which is my airplane house) and she has him stay for dinner after calling his mother. I come upon this because I am driving a car and they are doing something on the walk outside and I stop just sort of hitting them. (200 words)

My son, daughter and I are driving around town looking at all the nice Halloween decorations. Then my daughter is in a contest like a race. A classmate of my son's has a daughter who is also racing and some adults are in the race. One woman appears to be naked but when I look again she is all dressed in gray. We go through a series of buildings downtown including bars where there is a lot of smoke. At the theater we enter at the top and there is a steep stairs. My son makes about three jumps to the bottom. I walk. The stairway is curved at the top and bottom. We get outside and my son is having an asthma attack and is lying in a puddle of cold water. I put snow on his chest and he says it helps. No one seems to notice we are having trouble. (153 words)

A neighbor's house is on fire and we are living next door. We are in a hurry to get downtown as my daughter is somewhere else and wants a diet drink of some kind. she is in a hotel or something and can't get home. I can't find anything but black and white film and have trouble loading that. Then there is a problem that the fire is in the back of the house and won't make a good picture, but I find out the back is actually the front. The owner had it build that way on the lot. People are in our house. I am glad the house is burning because some Christians were going to buy it and they wouldn't let some other person who really wanted and needed it to have it. I never quite make it to take the picture because of one problem after another. (151 words)

I am doing a group hypnosis in a church, probably the church I attended as a child. We have moved the pews so they are in a diagonal line. People are laying in the pews to be hypnotized and I am upstairs in the choir loft looking down on them. I can't seem to get started because of interruptions. Two girls are there talking about prom dresses. One is pregnant. The other girl is one I thought would be more likely to get pregnant than the one who is. A pink prom dress is hanging on a door. The pews get wet, like from rain, and have to be dried off and we start all over again. Then the priest comes in and doesn't say anything about the hypnosis but I feel he is going to say something so I order everyone to straighten out the pews. The experiment is over. (151 words)

I tell the male nurse to get the cold water and someone in the background says, "cold water? That's not new. It causes TB." I say my skills have deteriorated and the nurse keeps buttering me up, especially in front of my husband, as though I am a hero even though I said to do the wrong thing. I say you just want me to work Saturday. I'm thinking now that I've done with my dissertation I should work one day a week at the hospital. (147 words)

I visit my friend, Marianne, in the hospital several times and each time we have to clear and re-arrange her room as it is always a mess. The floor is partly linoleum and partly carpet and it is almost impossible to arrange the room to keep the bed on the carpet. It seems like the room is more like a house and the linoleum part is the kitchen part. Marianne gets out of the hospital but still has the bed in a big vehicle. We are driving home and get so tired we pull into a yard to sleep. The owner, a woman, comes out and we follow her inside. My neighbor boy comes over to have the woman do something with an injury he has to his stomach. He also has a black eye and there is a little hole under the eye. I ask what happened and he says he doesn't remember. The woman's husband doesn't seem to mind that we are staying at their house. (168 words)

I am with a boy (whom I never actually met until after I was married and had several children.) But in the dream we are dating and I am debating whether to have sex with him. It is not a sexual dream, however. I am just debating the question. At a point I decide to do this as payment for something but then change my mind. We are then talking about marriage and someone mentions this is inconsiderate because his mother would have to travel over 100 miles. The setting is in northern New Mexico. I know this because someone says so, but it is not a place I have ever been in reality. The rocks look more like tree stumps. (163 words)

My oldest daughter is pregnant and all bloated and sick and says she didn't tell me because she didn't want me to worry. I want to get back to school. I am afraid I won't graduate if I miss any more school. But the church has now become a house that is actually a car and there is no driver. I am in the back seat and I struggle to get over the front to set up a seat to drive. My pregnant daughter doesn't seem concerned. Neither does my other daughter. Then I want a cup of tea and I go to the front of the car/house. Some girls have rented the front part and have decorated it for Christmas. I ask for water for tea. One of the girls looks in the freezer for the water. (166 words)

There is also a third person there in the same bad shape. I tell him I'm going to call the nursing home and he says no, they will be okay. I go to the refrigerator to get something for them and find part of a bottle of white grape juice and I am going to warm it. Then he comes out and still looks bad but is apparently healthy and goes into another room where he has guests and a party is going on. (172 words)

I am on a trip with my extended family - parents, several relatives, my own husband and children. I am returning to my hometown. We stay in a town about 100 miles away and are happy to have one more day of vacation. Then we have to come back. When we get back to my hometown there is a lot of snow and we have to walk a long ways. Just as we arrive at our house there is a lot more snow and we can't get to the house but there is a step ladder and it appears if we climb over the ladder we can get to the house. I go over the ladder and see we are still blocked off on the other side. My daughter, who is a small child in the dream, and some other people are on the other side of the ladder. I reach down to pick my daughter up and find there is smoke coming from her boots. I realize spontaneous combustion has occurred and her toes have burned off. They are all black and charred, but she does not seem to be hurting and isn't even crying. From my position at the top of the ladder I can also see someone in my family is checking the mailbox on the side of the house, but there is no mail. I know there will be no mail there because the right mailbox is on the front of the house. (247 words)

Some kids were dancing and I was wishing Blake would ask me. He did. We bopped all over. When it was done, we sat down. He said, "Your hair's messed up." I said, "Oh, dear, not again" (He had his arm around me). He bent to me and said, "Yes-let's mess up a mustache" and then he kissed me. The kiss was so real! Then I dreamed that Nate came home. I met him in S City at the bus depot. He was 6 feet tall and all muscles. He grabbed my hands and then threw his arms around me and kissed me,(All these dreams were when I was fast asleep).

I was in a hotel, in bed with a stranger. Her back was to me. I felt comfortable because it was a woman and I wouldn't have to worry about sexual demands. Suddenly, he turned and started to wrap himself around me (very large penis). There were feelings of anger and sexual pleasure together. He pinched my nipples. It hurt and I got very angry. Each time he'd pinch, I'd scream angrily, "No! Stop it! Don't!" He wouldn't listen. I pushed away. I ran downstairs out to the street. He followed in pursuit and tried to cajole me into wanting him. Now we were dressed. A crowd was wandering around. He asked me to dinner. He changed from aggressive to charming. I felt aloof but was interested. It is very vague at this point. There was more, but I can't remember. (141 words)

I've had this crazy dream. The kids were in the house. I was packing. Water emptied from leaks in the roof and elsewhere. I got on my blanket and clothes. I got in the pick up. Snow, deep on the ground. I was in a parking lot. I narrowly missed several cars. I parked next to a red car, jeep. A man was in it. The kids and I got in back. We went down the street. Passed school buses, slushy roads. I thought, "What will he say when he sees them gone?" Down a steep hill. In a house. I had to give man (cousin Abner or Nate) a shot. A two-pronged needle with red liquid. I know it will hurt him. I didn't want to but I had to. He yelled in pain. He turned on the bed, writhed around, and threw himself around. I snuck up and finished the dosage. He yelled in mock anger. He grabbed me. We tumbled to the floor. He started to make love, wildly, lovingly. Later at the table, an ugly woman with horrible eyes, glazed, hazy, and blue, came in. Said to him, "So there's the louse." I gave her a straight look. I said, "Just leave him alone!" Anger. She steadily looked at me. Another woman, possibly my mother watched the tense scene. (223 words)

A crazy dream riding a horse. We go over cliff. Fearful long drop to huge water (like round butte). We survive just barely. The horse and I swim forever to safety. Off to a house. My father is a strange "pervert" strapped to a table. He used to be a woman but now he's a man. Two "doctors" are standing, peeking under the sheet at his penis.

I was at cousin Patricia and husband Morton's house. They were showing me around the kitchen. It was huge. I remember a huge, carpeted room and a grand piano in the corner. Most luxurious. I thought, "How totally rich to have a grand piano in the dining room." I looked and a dining room table, most fancy, appeared as I felt it should be there. I went into another room, large, spacious, with rich red tones. I asked to see Morton's "sound room." I exclaimed at the cork on the walls, to sound proof the room. It was off-red tones. Traveled on to a "green house" room with high ceilings. Cut flowers, white, green, yellow, were up high on a ledge by a small sun light window on the ceiling. Vases, etc. were around the room. The house continued forever. I then tried to drive around. I knew myself to be in an old home town but couldn't remember the way; I kept passing the turn-offs. Driving, I said to myself, "Oh, you missed the turn off. You're headed toward A City." Pete was in the dream and so was Aunt Elaine. (192 words)

Again, I am in a richly decorated room, a large bed. I am eating very sweet rolls, butterscotch on sweet rolls. I am suspicious of it. A man has been "sent" by another man to make love to me. I am vaguely aware of all this and I'm suspicious. A thought occurs that, "Now it is OK. The sweets are fresh and not poisoned or drugged." The man leaves and the "original" man comes to me. A feeling of being pursued, not frightening. [BL] (83 words)

Lynn and Barry came visiting. I was making coffee. I couldn't do it correctly. The coffee was called "win" and were in "tea type bags." The water boiled. I put in the bag. It broke. I made very thick "candy." I made the second one OK. I watched the pure water being colored. I took the mistake and the cup to Lynn and Barry. They looked a little annoyed. I apologized. I went back. I made another cup of coffee, correctly. (81 words)

I was home napping. A football hero came over to visit. I got up. I offered to help him fix something to eat. I found a box of macaroni and started to boil those. I was looking for something to go with it. All I could find in the cupboard were stacks of 1 layer, frosted cakes in boxes and cellophane bags. I looked in the oven, a pan of stewed tomatoes. I stirred it with a spoon (that had holes in it). It was not very effective. My brace was lumpy and mis-shapened. My foot hurt to walk. I was embarrassed. I tried to adjust the brace. I thought I had it on crooked. I went into an adjoining room and called to my mother. She was stepping out of the bathroom. The football guy walked by the door. My mother clutched her robe together, embarrassed, as part of her stomach was showing. I ask her what she had planned for dinner as I didn't want to use that. She said, "Fish." I said, "Ugh!" Fade. Now I'm on a date with a young man, a sophomore. He's clean cut. We're walking down a street to get to his car. (201 words)

I was giving birth to a baby. I was on the "table" with green cloth draped over me. It was in a large room, like a gym. A nurse stood beside me. Another nurse stood behind her and a man stood behind her. The 1st nurse said to me, "Don't be a baby. Stop making a fuss." The man "wretched" for me. It was his job. Suddenly, the baby started coming. I felt and knew I was bleeding. I pushed down and "plop," the baby was born. "My 4th one," I thought, "so it was easier." I lay there exhausted. The doctor, who only stood there, didn't even catch the baby. For that matter, I didn't even see him. I just knew he had to be there. The nurse started to do the after birth things. The man pushed my table around fast, in circles. It made me dizzy and frightened. I cried out and clutched the table. They laughed. "Don't be so silly," they said. The nurse then repeated it. She rushed me on the table across the gym to the opposite wall. I got off the table. They were taunting me. I walked back across the floor, determined to make it on my own speed, but knowing I shouldn't walk because I could start bleeding. I got back on the table. The child was placed on my lap, "stomach." I looked at her. She appeared about 6 months to a year, sitting up. She had large feet, white paten leather shoes, a wide smile, teeth, and was in a dress. I thought to myself, "I know I agreed to carry my Uncle Philip's (Dale really) child, but they at least could have given me a new born." I felt used. My parents came in. They had made the preparations for all this last night. They were apologetic for not telling me the whole. My mother confessed that she didn't even tell her sister, Aunt Charlotte about the child, and Uncle Philip in a letter even though Aunt Charlotte was asking her to intervene on her behalf with Uncle. I looked at the child and noted family resemblances to Lisa (a cousin), and "Jolene," (another cousin). I felt cheated because nothing of me was in the child, like it would be if it were my child.

I was in old living room in M City. A doctor of mine comes in. He says that I must be at an early morning panel discussion about some new discoveries about curing arthritis. My father and Dwight are sitting with us. The doctor says that the new discovery is latex paint. It causes a "burning throat" and this somehow cures arthritis. I am incredulous; he is full of enthusiasm. He says I must get up at 1:30 am to be at the discussion. I say, "Wow! That's bad because then I also have to get up at 8:00 am for another meeting." My father says, "Well, these difficulties must be met with in life sometimes." The doctor agrees. I ask if oil painting does the same thing. He says, "No, only latex." (133 words)

A story is unfolded in a "court." A judge, male, fat, and cold, in a clothing store of some kind. Racks of "lacy" and "painted" dresses hang right next to jury. During the story, the one juror interrupts to say that someone wants to buy a dress. The proceedings are halted so that a dress is tried on. Lacy butterfly sleeves, a print skirt. The story involves a baby named Nancy (or Amort) who swallowed a peanut and started to suffocate. The air was cut off and she became a mental retard with a score of a "little less" than 70. Some man was keeping her as a pet and playing sexual games with her. The man was on trial. (120 words)

As I was "waking up" from a nap, Ginny and Rosemary were perched on my bed. Ginny was doing Math. I watched her count columns, carry and write numbers as she figured and I said, "You do math like me." She wasn't doing well. Then I got worried. I said, "Oh Lord, I'm sure that I'm signed up for an intro to German class, but I forgot to go to any classes and it's late in the term. I'll flunk." I started looking through my filing cabinet for the register form. I saw some B'day cards scrunched in there. Rosemary said, "Take those out." I had to see a boy standing on his head trying to say something but no one would listen. It was a B'day card to the devil. He had a grotesque red face, with huge reddish teeth. He was standing very large in a formal striped suit with a tie and carnation and a huge overcoat on. His coarse, snaky tail was draped around him. No fear. [BL] (171 words)

I was back to teaching, wearing a full skirt like in the 1950's that billowed and swirled around me. I was in my classroom, reading through a "reading" book and getting ideas to teach with. I felt good and capable. Xmas themes in the book. I hear a child crying, "Help! Help!" I go out into the hall. Some little girl was trying to push open the doors to get out of the girl's room. She had enough strength to hold it partially open but couldn't get any further! I picked her up and soothed her. I walked her up and down halls, feeling a limp in my bad leg but glad I could pick her up and carry her. Three times I went past the editor's office. He came out and walked with me (the girl disappeared). We were looking over lists of concerts (rock). He said, "You've probably not been to many." I said, "Ha. I certainly have." He showed me his arm. Two rock groups were engraved in red on his arm. "The Million Dollar Kid" and the "Crystal XXX." We strolled down the street. I told him how the people had kindly re-hired me and that I was feeling pretty good now and I could handle it. (211 words)

Fade. Kids and books (residue) from school still props in the dream but now I'm with a big, strong, ugly blonde guy. He's gentle and yet strong. He has a pickup. He gets me into the pickup (parked next to mine). He kisses my neck very softly. It's very sexy and sensual. I dig it. (55 words)

I am sitting around minding my own business and a young man (like Bob, coast guard) decides he likes me. He follows me around a lot; he decides he's in love with me. I am a little annoyed. He's like a puppy, always underfoot. He follows me around. His mom doesn't approve. Then I'm a member of a group of people (about 4 or 5 of us). We are sitting on a bench facing another group. We are diplomats/entertainers. A Prime Minister and his wife get up and dance a cute dance around. They are dancing the other group's native dance (like a minuet or country dance of England). I am watching. Then a guy (Howard/Arthur) grabs me and says, "Here, it's like this," and he and I dance the dance. I hurt as I try the steps going up to the platform, and feel embarrassed. I get back to the bench. I am annoyed with him for not warning me so I could practice. Now I'm lying face down getting a massage, next to a woman like Bette Midler. We are talking. She asks if I was upset and I say, "Ya, he should have given me time to practice, because I didn't like losing face." Then we're watching a guy called the "Roman slave," dancing. He wears a Roman toga and a "slave token" on his ear, a ceramic painted stone on a leather thong. A man/woman dances around him. As the man/woman dances, he moves his finger subtly into the gesture of the "finger." He puts the finger gesture of each hand into the belt loops, one marked "h" and threw the other marked "f." It was done like a strip tease. The group screams and laughs in delight at his audacity and subtlety. (297 words)

I had the most incredible dream. I was back in the hospital only it was a sort of school. I'd just been informed that I was going to be executed at 9:00 the next morning because I'd not gone to a meeting. I was paralyzed with fear and the enormity of the injustice. My 2 roommates, also condemned, went home for the night to be with friends and family. I didn't have anyone special to go to, so I stayed. Someone (perhaps my alter ego), came to me and said, "Come on, let's fight this. We'll go talk to them. They won't do it." We flew, over a muddy, cold, choppy lake. A lady in a helicopter was who we were to speak to. My friend advised me to speak confusingly, not good to be clear and direct. It didn't work. I was back in my room. The chaplain came in. He brought me a "form 52, a form of protest" to fill out. If I filled it out, they'd have to stop the execution and deliberate. He said, "Sometimes it takes them 'til summer!" [BL] (185 words)

She moved them to a drawer nest, one bright orange one, one yellow one. I said they would be mine. The rest would be given away. They were cute, fuzzy, and playful. There was a puppy in this dream too. Strange. What does this symbolize to me? [BL] (73 words)

I had a complex dream. I was traveling back to the Coast to see someone important (the kids, I think). I kept trying to think of the name of the place. City X didn't fit; State Y seemed appropriate. I was traveling first by plane, then by train and then on foot. I remember dreaming saying, "I'm in a Peyote dream" I kept meeting E City people, all warm and strong. Rosemary said, "You could always see deeper than me." Marty Ac and Jamie. (84 words)

More dreams. I was in a chair. 2 chair carriers, "Curly" and "Nigel" carried me to my new place of residence. They were warm and understanding. I was at the University. The administrator had chosen my new place. They carried me several narrow flights of stairs down to a basement. A door opened on my new room. It was fitted with MR's, CP's, and "Cripples." I asked the name of the residence hall. They said it was the "Handicapped and Cripples Home." I refused to go in. I said, "I've got a brace and a limp, but I won't be shoved away like they are." I insisted they take me to the administrator. He was terribly busy. I persisted. Curly and Nigel brought student support people. I demanded to be heard. I said, "It's not right. Some of these people can't get out of there into the sunshine." (148 words)

I had a strange dream. Someone named Chuck Mahoney had made an album. It was bad. Someone said, "Here's his second album. Isn't it lucky someone took a chance on him and laid the money down for a second try? It's really good, his second album." Then Raul and all the men from my past came in. I felt embarrassed. Then a man and a woman were facing each other. A question was asked of the woman. The man was fervently hoping she'd answer correctly in his favor, but she answered "money" and the man was very sad. He looked at me and said, "In some cases, divorce is very good." (111 words)

I was in bed. My heart started pounding and then beating irregularly. My spirit came out of my body. I saw my bedroom (arched doorway). I flew out through the window and sort of hung around wondering what I was supposed to do next (Dying was like I was the camera and as I ascended, the room got smaller and more distant). I decided to visit some people. I went to Blake's office. He couldn't see me. I sat cross legged on the desk top facing him, close, eye to eye. He looked suddenly sad. He went to the door, closed it, came back and sat down. I "enveloped him" with my spirit. He felt very sad. Then I ascended and went to Nate at his shop. The same thing. Then I was in a cloudy sky going up. I felt a little apprehensive because I would soon be high enough to run out of oxygen. Then I remembered that I didn't need air. I looked up. I broke through the clouds and felt happy because I was going to live among the stars. They were beautiful, diamond points, in a black velvet sky. I came to an immense hall (floor only, no roofs or walls). This was heaven. There were 2 large buildings at each end of the halls. Libraries were there so we could pursue learning, seeing as how we'd be there for an eternity. I met a girl (possibly Laurie). I asked her what we were supposed to do. She just shrugged and pointed to a door. We could pick rooms to live in. We were placed in general areas so that as other people we knew on Earth died, they'd come to the same area so we could be together. I asked, "What about people who remarried?" She answered it was no problem, everyone got along together up here. There were viewers in the library so we could watch people on Earth. I entered a room. There were several shower rooms. My 3 girls were there. If you got in a shower, you were transported back to Earth to live out another's life. I started to enter a shower room. My 2 eldest girls, Dovre and Ellie, had gone in. Then my youngest, Paulina, suddenly changed her mind and veered into another shower room. I hesitated and then followed her because I was worried she'd get into a tough area. I was transported to the body of a young, pretty blonde woman in the process of drowning in a raging white water river. I felt a little aggravated because I'd have to die twice. Then "we" made it to shore. I was separated from my daughter. I met people who knew the girl and I tried to understand my new surroundings. There was a man, slightly evil, a harem keeper type. I woke up. (478 words)

A bar. I went in. Several guys, musicians. I sat at their table. An older guy (like cook Dave) was telling stories. He mentioned the Quadriplegic Rodeo. I watched a "cat" that bumped into a jukebox (see drawing) that turned into a man on top and a woman on bottom. I walked through the bar stepping up on tables and chairs rather than going around them. Before that I had been riding a large deer with antlers. He was kind of wild and I kept thinking he'd turn on me. (90 words)

I was to teach a class in cooking. I had a sack full of papers, food stuffs, etc. I went to the office to see if I could make some schedule changes at the last minute but no dice. Sherrie said the recipe sounded good. She'd like a taste. She walked down to the classroom with me, Room 319. The same guy named Dave was teaching the same kind of class in the next room. I couldn't find my recipe card. I looked and looked. No students showed up. I suddenly remembered that I was to teach a laundry class next hour and I was not prepared at all. As I started cooking the meat, Eve called with list of names for a later club meeting. Sherrie was getting impatient. I felt incompetent. I then see the recipe card floating in a room of water. It is all soggy. I turn the meat over, and burn the card that was stuck in the oven door. I thought, "I must restructure the furniture in the room as I can't get around well," (previous dream snatches, Tony and Nancy W. A guy like Dwight.) (192 words)

Back at a place like uni house. The kids and I are going to see the movie "Tell Me that you Love me Junie Moon." We get to the concert hall. I see some friends (blonde woman), and the kids go to sit by them. I look in a side room. A circle of people sitting in chair (regular ones) forming. I chat for a moment and then go to join my kids. I see an empty space behind friends. I must "tightrope" walk a bench (blonde wood). As I almost get there, my "friends" get up and leave like strangers (I had overslept and was late to movie). Now I'm at a house. It's late at night and dark. Fletcher walks in. I say, "Hi." We talk. I say, "So, on your way back to Hawaii?" (He wore a Hawaiian shirt). He is surprised that I know so much about him. Generally he's cool and distant but when I read him right, he really looks at me. He starts to make love to me. He doesn't really care about me or how I feel. He has an orgasm. Then I feel an orgasm coming. He sucks my breasts. They are flabby and old. I am at first embarrassed. Then I don't care. I get in a dominant position and go for an orgasm. I kiss his ear. He is non-responsive. He's like Raul, but skinny like Elliot. [BL] (238 words)

The kids and I are in a large building. The girls have sent away for "spirits" or witches. We are directed to a room. It is a rip off. The girls are disappointed. Dovre goes upstairs to complain. She comes running down the stairs worried. A witch has threatened her. The witch comes downstairs and says we must buy or she'll "get us" with other scary spirits. I say, "Oh, yeh?" I "howl" at the air to protect my kids and scare the spirits away. I'm a little scared myself. I raise up in the air and yell, "Arrrr!" Kathleen comes around the corner. "What are you doing?" I say, "Looking to see if a lion comes at my kids." Then one comes around the corner, and I scare him. I raise up in the air and yell "Arrr." The lion stops. (142 words)

Howard and I split up. He takes the kids. As he walks away from me, their backs are all to me. I feel badly. I see "Drew" walking ahead of them. He has "given" me some other kids in exchange. I say, "No! I want at least one of my own." He finally agrees. I'm in a house. A group has arrived for a tour of a "fire engine-bus." I show them the fine features of the swivel driver's seat. We're in a field. There are lots of busses, games, and ladies at tables. I ask why we're so far away from the house. They shrug. A janitor comes by and points to the clock. "11:30," I say. "Break for lunch. We'll reset up closer to the house after lunch." In the house, there are lots of papers piled on a bench. I move them. (145 words)

I was at work. It was hectic. It was the beginning of the new term.I was trying to work on a report. People running in and out. Malcolm asked me to lunch. I said, "Yes," and then remembered I already had promised another person. I told her I couldn't make it, just as another woman came in my office to talk. Then the phone rang. A male voice said, "What's for dessert?" I laughed and started searching for my appointment book. I said, "This time I'm going to find the time." Then Malcolm, girl and I went to lunch. I was cutting a journalism class. I felt guilty. I then decided it was OK. A guy with long hair and a big sombrero sat next to us. Malcolm made some snide comment. The lady "sombrero" we were with gave an indirect apology and explanation. (144 words)

A few people were really listening. I was talking about disabled students at the community college. Halfway in the middle of the speech, people just got up and left. It was lunch time. They had things to do. I turned and a girl spoke to me. She was describing a terrible incident she had witnessed. I became a good counselor, drew her aside, noted that it was OK for her to cry and I listened well. (108 words)

---for shore a short distance away. He put out his hand and pulled me out. I turned to look at the pool. "A crocodile, 1 of 2 on the place," he said, surfaced, bubbling water, with eyes bulging. He went under again. I went back to the house. Another brother came out. He said he would give me a ride since my chair was broken. I sat on his left, my arm around his shoulders. We drove on a narrow hall like a ramp in an amusement park house, crowded with doors, curves, etc. He said, "Here's an interesting booth called 'the House'." It had a scale model of a huge house with many doors and windows. It was like an old tree. He sped up the chair as we approached a curb. We sailed over it and bounced. I smiled. Then I looked ahead. We went off the edge of a huge drop off, like an amusement ride, like the grand canyon. The pit of my stomach jerked. Instead of falling, he manipulated the chair so we "free floated" sideways in the air. It was fun. He was calm, somewhat detached. I felt branches gently touching the back of my head. I reached out and touched white blossoms on the tree. A nut fell in my hand. He guided the chair backwards to our jumping off point. At this point, I was sitting on his lap, facing him, looking up at his dispassionate face. We came to a stop on solid ground. I smiled and said, "Wow. You know, would you believe that I'm usually afraid of heights?" He made no response. I said, "What is this I picked from the tree?" He said, "You picked a nut off the tree. Just don't try to pick my nuts." I laughed. (301 words)

A wedding. The guests were dressed up like for Halloween, Witches, etc. The bride came and stood at the alter. A male in drag, crying (fake), and exaggerating a coquettish female, came down the aisle (raked steps like the theater at the community college). He was the "groom." Then after he got to the aisle, he took off his mask and was an usher. The real groom (male), came down the steps. The female minister in costume was replaced by a male, "real" minister.

I opened the door and went out. There were lots of people. Then I was an ant (only still my real self). A large person (woman) came to contemptuously step on me. "Get in that hole," she sneered. I was laying down and trying to squeeze under a post. I didn't fit. (84 words)

After the wedding, a friend and I were sitting in the auditorium. A good looking guy (minister) sat down next to me. My friend was talking to him.

Some one was injured. A child or a friend who was disabled. I was upset and frantic to find her. Minister had a speech problem. The angrier he got, the more he lisped and couldn't speak. He called on the phone to find out where the child was taken. We walked down a sidewalk. He said, "She was taken to the Monastery. Can you handle it?" I was explaining to him that I am a chameleon. "I have one basic personality but I blend in comfortably with lots of different people types." I said, "I can feel comfortable and make them comfortable, about Roman Catholics and about being conservative." He looked at me. "You are conservative." He said. I was startled that he knew. "How did you know?" I said. Then we're at a big palace, his home. People were talking about me behind my back. I awoke with the phrase, "A cripple for a Queen," being whispered. The minister was apparently the King of England. (166 words)

Rhonda, her husband, her "Ricardo" son, 2 1/2 yrs old and I were at a famous local actor's home auditioning. I did a good performance. The actor was very intense and liked my work. Rhonda was being supportive. Then the son became obnoxious and climbed all over the people and yelled and tried to break things. Rhonda had just adopted the child and didn't know how to handle him. She tried to coax him to be good. Her husband made a suggestion. She smiled and said, "What a good idea. 6 o'clock him." I felt like I could handle the son with no problem and wanted to help Rhonda.

Some heavy journey in the wilderness. Then, a young girl in a white satin bride dress comes into my shop. Everything is white. She is snotty and doesn't like me. She then goes into the next section of my shop, all white tablecloths, glasses, etc. She sits on red velvet. I think, "How beautiful." I then go to get in my car that I have finally gotten from my brother. It's a blue and white '55 Chevy with a continental kit. It's in good shape. It's punch hooked beautifully all over the outside. Both of my brothers are in the enormous backseat. Dwight is laughing and saying that the bride's brother doesn't want to marry me, but his family will force him to. He teases me because he knows I want to marry this guy. I think, "Hum, it could be interesting if we married," like it would be a challenge to get him to love me. I then tell Dwight the car is his. He grins and gets into the driver's seat. We start going. I grab at a styrofoam cup with coffee, cigs, ashtray, etc. and put them in my lap. I am sitting on a car seat that is sideways to the rest of the seats. Hot wax (pink) spills on my pant leg. Dwight drives us to a "turn-out" on a bridge that over looks the town of M City main street. (236 words)

Patsy wanted to show me something. Had a question. It was important. I went to a side room and knocked on the door. A man was inside (black). I had a lot of respect for him. Then as I opened the door, I saw that he had enormous, hard wood, tall (10 feet), pieces of furniture (grandfather clocks). At first I said, "I'm sorry to bother you. I'll only take 5 minutes." Then I exclaimed, "Oh, you have the clocks. They're not lost." I looked at one small one on a cabinet and admired the intricate inner workings. He smiled. I asked him my question. He helped me. It was a warm and gentle relationship. He was sitting on a bed. Then another man came in. He loved me. Patsy put a mortar board graduation hat on my head. He smiled. I said, "I got another degree, my master's, no, a second degree." I was sitting on the bed. He kissed me. I layed down. The hat wouldn't stay on. We agreed to get married. The door opened and Patsy was leaving. A third man looked in. He was sad because I wasn't marrying him. (195 words)

Paul McCartney and my "friends" were on one side of a room, and the Arabs were on the other. A chain link fence was between us but there were gaps in it. Paul started yelling insults and taunts at the Arabs. I said, "Stop it." I stood up and walked to him. The Arabs started yelling back and coming into "our" side of the room to fight. I was in the middle; I made them go back. Paul and the others started up again. I again tried to stop them. One Arab thanked me. Then, they all started again and I gave up. It was too big. I gathered up some things and left the room. Now I was in the hall. I said, "I want to get away, where there's no people." Paul said, "You want to go camping?" I'm not enthused. I want a fireplace, etc. My father said, "You can go somewhere remote, if you can handle traveling over the Texas desert." I ask if we can go where there are no hunters. I don't want to get shot.

Later, I'm being chased by people in 4 helicopters. They are trying to shoot me. I get on top of a green airplane just barely larger than my body. I lay down on it so it and I are the same configuration. I control the speed with my hands on the prop. We fly over a big shiny lake. I look back. Two men run and jump into the lake to escape the helicopter. They land head first in shallow water from the waist to the feet. They are out of the water (standing on their heads) I go over a mountain, calling ahead to get permission of the airport to land quickly. At first they refuse. I have to wait my turn, heavy traffic. I tell them this is an emergency. They say, "O.K., you'll have 10 seconds between planes." I then get inside the plane. I think, "No, I don't want to, I feel trapped," but then I decide to because I would have metal around me and the chair back to stop bullets. I land. Then I'm in a huge house sort of like M City, only there are lots of windows everywhere (like at in-service old club house). I tell people, "Duck down, or you'll get shot." A mixture of people are there. Chuck, Dylan and lots of young college age women. One young woman wants to know what's going to happen to our deal over the yarn if some of us get shot.

I have a date with Hank. I think it's strange that he asked me out. I ask him something about the counseling program at the University. He gives me a cold, straight look and says he's not going to be a counselor. I ask, "Why not?" He says because they told hime that he won't make a good counselor. He should go into some other business. We agree to go to a movie. We start to go, but something prevents it. Then Bonnie and I are preparing for dinner to give my parents. I am helping to get the food on the table. I say, "Well, at least I cooked the chicken...well, not exactly cooked, but I bought Kentucky Fried Chicken." I felt guilty and shrugged my shoulders to my mother. My father gave me a cold hard stare. He started talking to me in a low, strong monotone. There was a background of scary music like a killer stalking me. He told me I never did anything, to get out. Couldn't I at least even make my mother a cup of coffee? He went on and on. I was scared and started packing to leave. He had suddenly gone insane. He kept talking in that low voice. Bonnie and I left. He couldn't handle my disability. He kept referring to it. I went downstairs. I saw Lee (from uni house) lounging in a chair. I told Bonnie to wait a minute. I apologized because I couldn't make our date before. He had graying whiskers. I asked him to listen for sounds from above him (upstairs) to see if my father was hurting my mother and if he heard scuffling or hitting he was to go stop it. He said, "O.K." I felt guilty for not staying myself, but I felt afraid and didn't think I could help. I then went down the hallway. To the right was a pond or lake. My parents were in it. White haired. My father was pushing my mother under with one hand on top of her head. I saw the air bubbles and then just before she drowned he let her up to say mean things in that voice. "Had enough? Can't breathe? Don't be mean to me, that will teach you." She'd say, "Uh," and go under again. She hardly had time to take in a breath. She looked like me, only she had white hair. I then ran down the hall and called out, "Help, police." I called out to a lot of men out on the hill in Grandma Mildred's backyard. "Help Chuck! Help, Dylan! Help, Tyler! Come quickly! They slowly walked over to me and asked what was the matter. I asked them to stop my father. They looked around slowly. Then I went back inside and got the phone, an old time black one. It rang instead of a dial tone. I was in a "second best" living room at V's farm. I asked the old woman sitting across from me what was the matter with the telephone. She shrugged. "It always does that." The operator finally answers. She was very non-caring. "What do you want?" She asked. I said, "Connect me with the state mental institution. My father has gone insane." My father was staring at me in a cold, hard way as I said it. The music was there. She said, "They are closed." I looked at my watch. It was 1:10 a.m. I said, "What shall I do?" She said, "Oh, have him go out, downtown, and then if he hurts someone, the police will throw him in jail." I was appalled. I repeated that remark to a group of people in the room like I couldn't believe my ears at the non-preventative approach. The crime had to be committed before help could arrive. I hung up. Then I called the operator back. I asked her to connect me with Jim B. at the University. She told me a pleasant story how she went to school in Wisconsin with his wife, and then connected me. It rang and rang but there was no answer. Then I was aware of fear and that music from the phone. My father's voice said, "Hello, or Ya." It was very cold and menacing. I started to explain, "I am Barb Sanders. I went to school 2 years ago, do you remember me?" A long oppressive silence, the music. I went on to explain that I needed his help to get my father into a state mental hospital because he went gone insane. I put my hand over the receiver and asked Bonnie to peek into the other room to see if my father was on the extension. She said he was. I knew then I had been cut off. My father came back in the room and stared at me, cold and hard. The rest of the people, Lee, Bonnie, and the old woman, started to go to sleep. I felt tired and sleepy too. I felt fear because they were all going to go to sleep and I'd have to face him alone and I grew heavy with exhaustion. (861 words)

I was sitting/lying open position on a table top with a kitten on my tummy. I was looking open and sexy. A man was looking at me. He and his 3 brothers were paid by my father (a rancher) to protect us from some evil bunch of ranchers who had huge Clydesdale horses that pulled a big wagon. It was night. I kept seeing the shadow of these men riding by in the night on patrol. The guy got up and came to me all agitated and begged me to kiss him. I got coy and turned my head and said, "No!" This happened three times. He loved me and I teased him. Then later, there was a terrible train wreck, cars, the Clydales, everything destroyed. The evil one was trying to hurt me. I married this man who loved me. I was ill or something; I couldn't remember that I had kids. 5 kids came by and someone said, "These are yours." 3 redheads and 3 blondes. One of the children said, "And Paulina died." I was shocked and hurt. The child who said it looked like he felt badly for having blurted it out. It was like I had been mentally ill and was coming out of it. Later, I had some warm feelings for this man and we hugged. (222 words)

I was on stage with lots of people. I was sitting at a small table with 3 or 4 people. The rest were on risers, facing the audience. A woman in the group turned to another woman and started picking on her verbally. I didn't like it. I stood up and placed my body between them and faced the one who was attacking. I shook her shoulders and said, "Stop it. I'm tired of this and I want you all to stop now!" Then, we all sang for the audience. I was standing in front of the group. I sang with the group. Then I had a solo. It was beautiful; 1 long, high, clear note. I got a standing ovation. I was looking at the audience wondering if it were a standing ovation, or if they were leaving because it was the end of the play. A very tall red headed man, shy, came over to me. He was naive. He wanted to kiss me. I was amused. He would bend way down. The kiss wasn't very satisfactory. He kept trying different ways. Finally, I got a little exasperated that he wasn't figuring it out fast enough, so I reached out and hopped up and wrapped my arms around him. It was a very satisfying, sexy kiss. I could feel his penis, hard and I thought, "Oh, it's small." Maybe I should stop before it goes any further. (239 words)

I was teaching a young man to play the trumpet, even though I don't play one. I showed him how to play a clear note. Then I played a song. I was good. Some man of importance was watching. Then the volatile girlfriend of the young man came looking for him. She was very emotional. I followed them upstairs and hid in the closet to overhear. Then I felt badly about not being open, and came to them, like a counselor. He asked me to stay and listen. I did. The situation then cleared up. The girl and I went down steep stairs (like in the theater), and sat on stools. Mine was high. We hoped no one would question us because we had no tickets. Earl came by and handed his tickets at us thinking we were ushers. (139 words)

Later, I had a confrontation with an authority figure (I think it was me). I had something I was going to trade for the coral pillow that was directly connected with my mother's "enslavement." He had her under his power (like blackmail) as long as he had the coral pillow. He said, "You want all of it?" I said, "Yes." He said, "O.K." Then I was driving. Some one is with me (a young man, I think). I take a new path. It's like I was saying to myself, "Ah, ya, I'm free now. I can break the old habits and take a new path. I felt scared, like he would disapprove and I'd get in trouble. Then over a rise, I saw the ocean from a new perspective and it was beautiful. Then I went over the rise. The path was so steep, like a cliff. I made it. There was a table in the ocean. Some person had his head in the "sand." On the table was an old faded silk pillow with a picture of a leopard on it (like my needlepoint pillow). I felt blocked by this man, but then I just reached out and took the pillow and gave it to my mother (the man and my mother were also me). I felt very free and exhilarated. (222 words)

A man had a newborn baby with him. It was very small. I felt great caring for the baby. I nursed it and cuddled it. The man took me to his house. It was the wee hours of the night. His wife came out of the other room and looked at us. The man was a picture of guilt. I bluffed my way through, trying to think of logical reasons why I was there and looking calm and collected. I felt guilty also. (83 words)

I was throwing papers away in a box. A fire started in the box (hot stuff in papers created coals and sparks). My needlepoint canvas caught fire. I hit it with my hand to put it out. Then, I had a glove on. I got the fire out. Then I saw that my guitar was on fire, at the heads. I took a towel and smothered the fires. I noticed my banjo was lying on the floor under the guitars and was unharmed. I looked at it. Then I saw a fire place with a roll of butcher paper stuck in it (like my class is doing life-lines on). The paper was on fire. I took out things I didn't want to burn. Then a rack of clothes, lots of them, were beside the fireplace. I told my mother, "These are old and out of date. I think I'll throw them away." She was shocked. "You could fix them up." I said, "I hate to sew." She was more shocked and angry. "Why didn't you tell me that when I was younger? Then I wouldn't have bought you material and stuff," (that I had asked for). I said, "At that time I was trying to like it, but everything I sewed looked bad, seams were uneven, stitches were showing, zippers were uneven, etc." Lydia held up a mauve dress for a 1 yr old. She said, "Here, I've outgrown this, you can have it and maybe fix it." I said, "No, It won't fit me or my girls. I have no use for it." She was annoyed with me. (269 words)

I'm in a pool of water. My oldest daughter Dovre, is with me. She has 3 air mattresses she is laying on; she keeps rearranging them. One has a nice texture, another goes inside the outer layer of the other. I'm on an air mattress too. I float to the shallows. There is a large house near by. I say that I'm really tired. I don't want to go to the "thing" tonight. "Maybe I'll go and take a nap and later we can go." She agrees. I go to the house. I'm in the kitchen and my cousin Darcy is upstairs. She screams and runs down to us. We go upstairs because we can't understand what she is telling us. She points to a bed covered with blankets and clothes. The electric blanket on top keeps sparking. She's frantic about that spark. "It will start a fire." I calm her down and she leaves. I look at the dresser against the wall behind the bed and it's covered with clothes, things. I sigh because it will take a lot of work to put it all in order and pack it. I start downstairs and an old woman, the landlady, is at the bottom coming up to see what all the fuss is about. I talk to her as I descend. Then I notice a few people sitting around and standing in my living room. Now it's a cocktail party. Everyone has name tags. A balding man stops me and introduces himself and says,"Hi." He knows Verna the librarian and he just wanted to say hi. He says something else but I don't hear it. I pretend I understand and nod hoping I made the right response. There are 3 or 4 couples on or near the couch. I go over there. A reddish-haired guy comes down the stairs playing detective. He's sleuthing for his birthday present. It is some family custom of my neighbors that are somehow in-law related to me. He finds a cardboard box with record albums in it, alphabetized with ABC indexes. He pulls one out and hands it to a woman, his mate. He says the name of it and shrugs and says, "I'd give it a 9." She's a little put out at him. What if the giver of the present were around. They'll have hurt feelings. His name is Gary. Then the other couple's cardboard boxes appear on their laps and they do it also. I am there but not a real part of the group. (423 words)

I was in our house in M City. I was in bed in my bedroom. I was suddenly remembering that I had hidden some letters and papers I had written long ago. That could help me understand. They were hidden in the side corners of the mattress. Near the bed, I saw some old books from my childhood. I picked up "Little Women" and was glad to find it. Then I started ripping off a cloth rectangle "label" of the corner (side of the mattress). I felt in there. At first I thought, "This is silly. There won't be anything there." I felt mattress stuffing. In the background, I sensed my mother. Then I found a letter, then some more letters, pads, and paper. I was so happy I had hidden them a long ago, and now I had them and they would help me. Then I went down to the swimming pool in M City. I walked well, no limp. I marveled at my cure. Still had limp muscles but felt I could fix them with a few days of exercise. I went into the women's dressing room. I knew I was going to see Darryl. I changed, a 1 piece black swim suit. I looked down at myself. My body was 37 years, breasts were sagging, etc., but still looking pretty good. I stepped to the door and showered. Then I felt my old anxieties well up and constrict my throat. I felt frozen. Then I smelled the strong odor of "chloroform," no, "chlorophyll," no, chlorine. I realized that was what was doing it. It had triggered an old memory. Then I felt O.K. I went in and marveled at how the swimming pool had changed. It was Olympic size, with lots of ladders and things to play on. I got in, marveling that it was easy now, that I was cured. I swam toward the deep end, not in excellent form, but O.K. 2 men were there from my old high school days. 1 was an old friend, the other was Darryl. He saw me. I smiled. He recognized me. His teeth were blackened out, some of them. He had changed too. He came over to me and the old feelings were there. We played in the water. We'd go underwater, laying one on top of the other and kiss. It felt good. We'd come up for air and roll over to reverse positions. Then I saw that newborn babies were being brought to their parents to have a snack and enjoy a swim with them. 1, dark haired, dark eyes, stared at me and I at him. I thought, "Huh, how large their heads are." Then Darryl and I agree to meet after we get out of the swimming pool. I had by this time chosen to ignore this other guy. I "gave him up." Then I'm back in the shower room, feeling happy and excited about meeting Darryl. Some of the "girl" cliques start asking me questions. I reminisce with them. I tell them an amusing story about Darryl. They invite me to go to a party at a nice house. I think maybe I'll go. I don't like them, but they are the "in" crowd. I think maybe I'll bring Darryl along. Somehow this is slightly shocking and I laugh to myself because it's fun. (561 words)

I was in the bathroom of a large department store, sitting on the toilet. It was crowded. People would peek in. There were two men in the lobby area by the sinks. A woman questioned them and they laughed. They were really women dressed like men. Then I saw George Hamilton, a star, come in. He came over to me and peeked in. I was a little embarrassed because my butt was showing. I got up and he wanted to hug me. That was O.K. He suggested we go to his hotel room to make love. I said, "No, I don't want to," because I wanted him to care for me, or be caring and then the sex would be good. He looks like, "Uh, oh. She wants to get married." and I said, "No, it doesn't mean we'll be together forever, just that when we're together, I want to feel close, cared for." He agreed and so I agreed to go to his room. At first, I just give in. I was kind of angry and then I really want to. We went to his hotel suite, many rooms. He's a big star and it was between performances. Then, he really began caring for me and he said, "Goodnight," and kissed me. He was going to take me home or let me go home. I say, "Hum, that's sweet, but I'd really like to stay." He was glad. We then heard other people in another room. Kids were using the communal kitchen from the other apartment. He had a round piano, very pretty, in his room. It was a small room. Then, there were lots of people around us and we were in a living room. He was then feeding a baby baby food and I had nothing to do. I wandered around aimlessly. I then said, "I can do that, let me." He didn't want me to do anything, because he cared for me. Then I had the bowl of baby food and I was feeding the baby, only then I realized I was feeding myself. I was a little embarrassed for being selfish. Then I went away. I then saw a bunch of Indian men. I went to them and said, "Did you know that Indian men are more useful and important than white women?" They were a little angry and then agree. I keep repeating that. Some women heard and also agree. Then I asked the Indian chief to teach me. He showed me an intricate way of holding a metal thing, like a wrench or a peace pipe. I didn't get it right and then I get it. (443 words)

I was a lion cub, trying to hide from a big gorilla that was going to hurt me. I would try to squeeze myself under furniture but he'd still see me. I felt very afraid. A baby monkey would then be near me and his father, the gorilla, would look for him and that would lead him closer to me. Then I was the baby monkey and my father was after me. [BL] (72 words)

Later, I'm in a department store. Thea is the sales lady. I'm looking at a package of something, maybe sewing patterns. She asks me to get some zippers off the rack and bring them to her. She keeps talking about how the boss keeps asking her if she needs this tool or that tool and she'd say yes and he'd buy it for her. Now she has hundreds of these zippers, she complains, and in the same breath would say, "And we need them, don't we?" (86 words)

Later, I'm at a hotel to go to an Iron Duchess conference. My father is there to help me carry in my suitcase etc. We are at the bar, at the check-in desk, and I say, "I'll meet you in the bar downstairs; I'm going to go see if the people are here yet." The way to get to the bar downstairs is to drop down from the level I'm at now. I'm walking. I sit on the floor and then hang on the edge and let my body swing down. I'm afraid to let go because it's quite a drop. I'm afraid I'll hurt myself, my ankles. I look for a bartender or someone to help me, but no one. I let go and land on my right foot. I'm surprised that it didn't hurt. I look around and then I see the conference room and Rochelle. She waves to me. I'm a little embarrassed because I'm walking (so I sit on a couch with another woman). I see B. B. and she welcomes me and introduces me to Jim D, only it's a woman. They laugh, "Ha, ha," a funny joke. I shake my head. "Boy, I'm sure slow today. I just heard the intro and believed it." We all laughed. I say, "Well, I'll be back. I'm going to see what's keeping my father and where my room is etc." I was thinking, "I sure hope none of them are my room mates," (some are lesbians). I go back to the bar to find my father. He's nowhere in sight. There are lots of guys (B. B. comes with me). They are looking at us. I make a big show of looking for my father so they'll know what I'm doing. Someone keeps whistling at me (not a wolf whistle), so I think, "Maybe it's Dad," and I continue to look around. Finally I figure out that he's still upstairs, so I go to the elevator, conscious of all the distance I'm walking. I get back upstairs and he's waiting for me. He'd taken my suitcase to my rooms for me. I was glad to find him. I was feeling worried about him as though he were a lost kid and might be afraid. (377 words)

(Before this dream) There is a baby. Someone has it. I take it. It is a baby girl. I think I should put a hat on its head to protect it. I hold it and coo at it. Then my father and I are walking down a hall. I have the baby. A woman and a 3 year-old girl are walking ahead of us. The girl wants a toy. The woman says, "O.K., I'll get you a toy, lots of toys." Then she thought and said, "Only maybe the toys should be supplied by the child welfare division as that's where you're from. Yes, we'll wait and they will provide the toys." The girl felt very sad and I felt very sad. I looked at my father and he looked at me. We both knew the lady was wrong. We knew that because my mother had worked at the child welfare division. The woman looked at me and I shook my head no. "You're wrong," I say. "You should buy the toys." The woman and girl were getting into the elevator. She looked annoyed and caught. (186 words)

A conversation between 2 women, both myself, I think. One said, "Look. See, she told me about it." The other laughed and said, "Oh, ya?" She didn't believe it. I was a little embarrassed, like being caught in a little white lie. I said, "Well, anyway, she showed me...sort of...in an indirect non-verbal way." (54 words)

I was going to sail away on the blue ocean. My wheelchair was attached to the ship like a dingy rowboat (life raft?), and I was navigating the surf, the shallows from the land to the deep blue ocean. I was aware that this was the dangerous time of the voyage. My chair was heavy and might get water logged and sink us all, but after we were on the deep water, the chair would be the important and safe power source for the ship. (85 words)

The children and I were in a room. I was picking up my knitting and pulled a thread out. I was annoyed and then shrugged my shoulders. "Eh! I'll just rip the whole thing out and do it over again." I then saw I was close to completing it. I decided to try to salvage it. I started looking for a small piece of yarn of the same color (off-white). I was holding the knitting gingerly so I wouldn't snag it further and really unravel it for good. The kids were in the way and not being helpful. I was slightly angry with them, at Ellie for not helping, and at Paulina for having taken some of the yarn. I would "almost" find it and then it would change and not be the right shade. I then looked over at some goats frolicking in a yard. I said, "Oh, look at the one dancing on its hind feet, standing up." Someone laughed and said, "That's some goat. It's a small human man." I then saw that it was. He and 2 others like him came over to the door. I looked down at them and chatted, thinking how good I was to not be unduly upset about their "disability" or strangeness. I was then aware of some conflict in a bar. My brother Dwight was in trouble. I went over there to help my brother. The small man followed me. Dwight was being told he had to give the bartender some money. The bartender was my cousin Terence. He was a bad man (the bartender). I argued for Dwight and threatened the bartender like a lawyer. I had no evidence but I bluffed that I could get him thrown in jail, etc. He persevered. I then saw a trapeze bar with a metal sort of door handle on it. It was a game. If you could jump straight up and hit it with the end of your cane (or stick) 35 times, you won lots of money. I did it 33 times and a couple more for good measure. I was aware that that was pretty good physical activity for my ankle joints being in the condition they were. I took my note (a card with a hole punched in it), over to the bartender and asked for my money. I was proud of my accomplishment. He started to renege, but I pointed out that I had witnesses to my accomplishment. He was angry, but agreed reluctantly to get the money. (421 words)

I was in a marathon road race. I was back in M City, wearing a cute cheerleader outfit. My running partner was Reta, an old high school girl friend. I was exhilarated because I was in this race. I figured I wouldn't finish but at least I could do a segment and then someone else would finish for me. We ran through the paths on L College campus. It was pretty, I was pretty and I didn't hurt. Other girls in the race were amazed at me that I could run. It felt good. We stopped at my old dorm for a drink of water. I looked in at my old room. A man was there. He came out for a chat. Then I remembered the race and we went on. I went on, feeling a little slowed up by Reta, but not too annoyed because I enjoyed being where I was. Then I looked up and a large black lion was running toward me. I got a little scared, and layed down on the path on my back so the lion wouldn't see me and hurt me. He ran close to me and around me and I was very tense. Then there was a second one with a black head and checkered body. They finally left. I got up and ran some more. A girl went by and said, "When you want your replacement, just let them know. I grinned. I decided I was going to go to the finish. Reta was slowing me up. I was annoyed now and kept asking her to pick up her pace. I lengthened my strides. It was hard work then, but I did it. We get to the downtown section of M City. We are near the finish. We then go through the old grade school. We can't find the door out. I think I know where it is, but it's gone now. Then we find it. I then see a store. A man is there. He's the owner of it. I go on. At this point I'm lost. I can't find the finish. I get angry and anxious. I see an information booth. They are having a bake sale. I ask a woman there for directions. She pulls out pamphlets and we talk. I feel time passing. She says, "Ah, you need to go to Rose's place," (a drug store cafe). I say, "O.K., Reta, let's go. If you can't keep up, I'm going on without you." Now time and the race are more important than her or the enjoyment or the nostalgic surroundings. I run. I almost get to the finish. I run down a hall. Just before I turn left into a door, There's a bed. Thea is there, in the bed, laying down and moaning. She's drunk and incoherent. I look at her and then go though the door. I turn right down a short hall. The other girls who have finished the race are there, resting, talking, one (Sherrie, I think), smiles. I say, "Where's the finish line?" She points back into the room at a silk cloth item with a Valentine's heart on it and pockets. "Touch that," she says. I do. I am weary and glad that I had finished the whole race. (548 words)

I was at a dinner table. My cousin Sonja and my Aunt Naomi and Uncle Philip and my mother and I were at the table. Sonja kept getting into trouble and I sat there all proper and correct. I was glad it was her and not me. I was feeling a little smug. My Uncle Philip talked to me and I remembered when I was 13 or 14 that he'd "wrestle" with me and tickle me and once lay on top of me and then backed off. I was coy. I enjoyed it and I played innocently. It was raining and dark. I was scared because I'd have to drive home alone and maybe I couldn't see well. I went to the bathroom to blow my nose. Something was lodged in it, dried snot, that looked like chewing gum. I pulled the toilet paper off the roll and there was shit on it. "Eyuck," was my feeling response. My mother was coming toward the door telling me to hurry up. I felt slight anxiety about being messy and being caught at it. (182 words)

I was at a third night of auditions with Rhonda as director. I had not gotten a small part I was after but had come to watch because it was fun. I sat way down front, sort of crouched so she wouldn't see me as I was embarrassed that I had given her such a low energy level audition the first night. The lights came up and she saw me and was delighted. We greeted and laughed. She was annoyed at the men trying out for a part. They weren't getting it right. They were supposed to go be an ambassador that couldn't get anything right, walking into flags, etc., and bouncing off furniture. She'd taken a photo of each one lying down. The noses and lips were important in profile and in blue light. None of them were right. I laughingly said, "Shall I try it? I bet I could do it, although the part would have to be rewritten for a woman." She liked the idea, so I started to go to the stage. My nose was running badly and I couldn't find anything to blow it with. I looked around and asked everyone if they had some toilet paper I could use. Everyone else had colds and were holding bits of it. One finally gave up one corner and we all laughed. I said, "Oh thanks, I see it's a precious commodity." I couldn't remember the lines so I looked around for a script. Then I noticed they were resetting up the stage for another scene, a thanksgiving table setting. Rhonda was directing people to sing "America." I joined in and sang one word wrong because they had changed it and I didn't know. I valiantly tried to keep up, wincing when I got it wrong. The cast was very quick and did just as they are told. She was a tough task master but yet caring and gentle. I asked her somewhat hesitantly if she had changed her mind about seeing me in that part. She looked startled and then remembered. Her mind was on many things. She apologized and said, "Well sorry, we haven't got time," and hoped I'd understand. I wanted the part but did understand and said, "Oh sure, no problem." Then a group of the cast gathered around her on the stage. She was giving directions about the song. She said, "It's so hard to remember but the song is a satire and we must sing 'ving' instead of 'nam'." (418 words)

I was walking through a pasture. Many horses were standing up, all looking in the same direction. One by one the horses suddenly laid down and died. They had been poisoned. 1 lone horse, the mama (chief or leader), cried out over and over again. I was appalled. Some one had poisoned them. Then I saw 2 men, one tall and wearing black, one crafty looking, a little older and plump (like bad guys in westerns). I pulled a rifle on them and fiercely told them to walk side by side, no tricks. I was taking them in. They looked mean and confident. They knew that they could scare me because I was a woman. They tried to separate so one could rush me. I threatened to shoot to kill. They got back together. Then one picked up a board. I said, "Put it down or I'll shoot you in the belly." They kept trying it. Finally they made a lunge and I shot. They wouldn't die so I fired again and again (gatlin gun line from play). I pointed out to them that they were dead and they finally keeled over. I then walked into a house and started to go upstairs. A man was talking. He was lovingly looking at different rifles and talking about how neat to have one that felt right in his hands. I was annoyed at him. A rifle is a device to kill with, if necessary, a tool, not something to revere. I looked around at the rifles for women. They were .22's, light, worthless. I was disgusted. I was in an upstairs male dormitory now. Howard was in a single bed. There were book shelves next to his bed, built into the wall. I layed down beside him, being very careful not to touch him and ignore him. He was cold, rigid and ignoring me. I looked at the books across him and accidentally caught his eye (the other men were talking about the recent shooting exploits tinged with respect). I turned my back on Howard and curled up in a fetal ball sleeping position. My "pussy" accidentally touched his bare leg. Then he started crying with me and pleading with me not to go, to please come back. I felt sick in my stomach and got out of bed. He pleaded. He said he tried. "What do you want?" He gave me silence, isn't that what I wanted? I was disgusted. I said, "No! I don't want silence. I want you to really understand me, comprehend me, care about me. Everything is for you. Your work comes first, your needs are first. You never really looked at me." He was pathetic, weeping, clinging and angry at me. I muttered something about, "I'll never listen to you men again." We started yelling at each other. Other men in the dorm got disgusted with us and left. I said, "I wish you would understand and I wish you'd let me have more time with the girls. Do you know what they say to me during the summers? That daddy never listens, he never shows me he loves us. Do you know they don't want to go back to you? Someday, you'll lose them the same as you lost me." I was almost crying, I had hurt him and I didn't want to. I really wanted him to understand and he didn't. He clutched at my hand, his hands were white and pink spotted. I yanked away from him and left. (587 words)

The end of the world. Outside forces of the universe were pulling on Earth. We were in our final days, volcanos, ash falls, real lava. I was in a small town, like M City. There were feelings of doom, some panic. We were getting ready to be rescued by a big plane but it needed a place to land. I looked around. The ground was too bumpy and full of sage brush. The railroad tracks were the only answer. But then I saw a train load of people on the tracks. I felt upset and annoyed. I couldn't let the plane land until I'd cleared the tracks. The people got off the train. They were insane, crazy, helpless people. I feel overwhelmed, sad. I wanted to get rescued. I didn't want to die, but I can't just abandon these people in their need. I couldn't make the order that would kill them. I was annoyed. I thought, "Maybe I will. To hell with them," but I couldn't. (167 words)

I was at school, a conference or something. I was in my wheelchair. To get to where I was to sit in a crowded, tiered room was difficult. I sat at a "bar table" and got onto a bar stool. Then I had to go to the bathroom. I got back into my wheelchair and struggled through the crowd. Some men cornered me and sassed me. They took my chair. I limped back to the table. People stared at me and couldn't understand my change. A coast guard man (like one in another state), decided he had to be in love with me, puppy love. He kept trying to kiss me. I kept him at arm's length. It was a struggle. He was persistent. Finally, I agreed to go with him to a dance or something. I went to a room to change my clothes. By that time, I didn't worry about my chair (before, the bar keep was around and wanted to help me get it). We went to the room. I put on 2 underslips, one is like the current style, long slit in front. The other is old fashioned, shorter, full body, skirt was even more old fashioned, shorter (1st slip, 1980, 2nd 1970, skirt 1960, pearls around neck, 1950). It looked funny, so I rearranged outfits so the slips didn't show. The ardent man had friends that at first teased him. They didn't like me. They peeked in and harassed me. Finally they accepted me. I was excited about the dance now. We got in car and drove. We got there. The man was having intense feelings. I was protecting myself and also warming myself on his feelings. I saw Will S. He had 2 babies. He was taking care of them. I came over and touched one. I asked permission to help and hold one. He was aloof. I said, "Oh, you don't like people to touch them. You like a lot of space around you and yours. I think it is too much space." I was aware of my bravery in telling this man I admired that I thought he was personally wrong on this issue. He had a problem, just like real people, even more than mine. Then I went on. Mabel asked me a question about my book which was published recently. She was snide about making money. I really told her off. I said, "You can bet your sweet ass I will make money." She raised her eyebrows in shock. She was up against a wall and I was in righteous anger and really yelling. I said, "Ya, but I also did a good book. It will be helpful, it is good reading, etc." (453 words)

I was aware of two good, heavy dreams. I even had the images still in my head but I was unable to verbalize what I dreamed. No sequence or objects to put names to. There was a sense of something dying so that the next phase can grow and be born and then that going away so first phase has its turn stronger. [BL] (63 words)

Later dream. I found a small monkey, miniature, really. He was given to me. He was in a bird cage, gold. There was glass so it was also like a fishbowl. It was dying because there was no air, food, or water. I opened a door in the glass to let in air. I could hear it hissing in and I could feel the flow of air into the cage. It was cold and "mean." I then got his food and water containers. I "thought" talked to it soothingly. "Poor little thing. I'll bet you think I'm taking this away from you to hurt you, but see, I'm filling the cup and it's fresh. Now, here's the water. That's the most important, isn't it?" The water cup then partially collapsed and the water spilled onto the food, but it was still O.K., just a little messy. Then I got nervous. I watched as the monkey changed. It was supposed to be cute and sit on my shoulder and chitter and be furry and hug me. I had held the door partially open with my keys (on a little sandal shoe), but the monkey was tiny, like a spider with a long tail. Then it was a small snake. I got really scared. The snake was growing and it was going to eat me, or kill me. It grew and I fled the room. I was on a road/freeway. There were many cars. I was in one. We were all fleeing the snake. It was huge now. The freeway was choked with cars. There was road construction and dust was thick in the air. I heard the screams of the others being killed by the snake. I felt fear and a certainty that this was it. No escape. The snake would get me. I looked to my left. The snake was on a moving train, devouring it and the people on it. I veered to the right and got out of the car, I tried to make myself very small and tried to burrow into the ground. I was burying myself alive to escape the notice of the snake. I felt doomed. It would find me. (365 words)

Later, I was in a house with 2 teenagers (boy and girl), supposedly my children. We had shut and locked all the doors and windows because awful bats that could suck out all our feelings and insides were trying to get in and get us. The front door wasn't really a front door. A branch from a tree was the door. There were holes in it that the bats could fly through. I got a heavy hatchet but the handle was a small, dry, breakable, flexible twig. I was going to kill the bats as they came in. I could sense them out in the dark. I went to the branch. It semi-fell down. Then birds, white with pretty eyes, started to come through. I had to chop and chop on their necks. Bloody, and their heads fell off. It was hard to kill them. Then they went away. My "children" said, "Oh, thank goodness, it's all over." I didn't believe it. I was still worried. Then people came through the door. They were friendly, in a group, moving in. I knew that they were going to get us. I wouldn't let them near me. My kids went to them. One grandmother kissed my son. I felt heartsick. They were going to finally get us. (215 words)

(First dream of the night). Fear on bed, in the bedroom, rising up the curtain like in an elevator, but I'm not. As I'm going down, I get more fearful. There is a hole in the curtain and outside the hole is a cage, but my fear of it is like it's a Nazi concentration camp. I scream because I'm going to be pushed out of the window into the cage. I push myself backwards. It was a weak push but I fall back hard. I fall across the room. I move furniture as I fall so I won't get hurt and land on the floor at foot of the bed. 2 children are in the bedroom, a little boy and a little girl. A pouch with a banana is handed to me. I get sexually excited, aggressively, powerfully so. I grin and pull 2 legs out of the pouch and the banana turns into a penis. I want it badly. I kick the little girl out of the way. I place the penis in me and I can feel it, real. I hold the man tightly and the closer I get to orgasm, the fiercer I am. Then I see a "picture" of our faces. I'm smiling, really into it. He's smiling because it gives him joy to see me feel so good (fierce, intense smiles). As I start to have an orgasm, a little boy is screaming, "Daddy! Daddy, don't!" 2 policemen come in. I can't talk. I try to but can't. I want to finish. I can hear the screams ( I wake up, feeling like it was a nightmare). (273 words)

A huge house with a brick front and bay windows (centuries old) started to shake. All the bricks were falling off and the window shattered, like an earthquake. I remembered the kids were in the house and so were Andrea's babies. I hesitated and then went in to get my girls. Ellie was being stubborn. She and I argued all the way out. I sensed that the babies were still in the house, but I went on out with my kids. Lots of pieces of the house were falling all around us. We crowded into a doorway across the lawn from the house. Something about a lot of pills. A man was near by. (114 words)

I was laying on the couch in the M City house, watching T.V. My mother was in the kitchen doing dishes. Dwight, my father and I were waiting for her to finish so we could go vote for the president. I was feeling lazy and didn't particularly want to go. I was aware of my mother's anger at us because she was working and we were waiting. I was annoyed at her for making me feel her anger, but I just let it ride. My mother gave me the baby (hers) and said, "Feed it while I do the dishes and maybe we'll make it on time." I felt guilty. She was really overworked and anger was spilling out. Dwight groaned and said he didn't really want to go. She gave an angrily voiced lecture on the rights and privileges and responsibilities of a citizen. I fed the baby her water and then her milk. I watched her. She drank quickly and I burped her. She looked like my daughter. I looked to see if she had spit up on me. My father came in and said in a martyred tone that my mother had decided not to go vote. She had too much to do and didn't want to hold us up. I sighed and said, "Oh, honestly, she could do it. She's just being in one of her moods." I was annoyed with her passive-aggressive moves.

A secret door. I started to go through the back door. 2 men were blocking the way. I shut the door and went through a side secret door. It led to an old abandoned room. Somehow I had made a time change. I was back in pre-historic times, in a cave. I stood near the mouth of the cave and an eerie light (green phosphorous) shone on me. I cast my image out into the night to look scary. It scared the natives. I saw some children swimming from school, raging water. This was ordinary for them. 1 girl had to walk on land the long way around. The clansmen talked about raising the bridge the children walked on so it was above the water in storms so they wouldn't have to swim so dangerously. I met a man, a caveman. I was intelligent and seemed to know things (realized memories from modern times would unconsciously filter through and I would solve problems). Others felt nervous about me, because I was so good at figuring things out. A plane landed on the swimming place. A man got out, and pushed the light craft up to shore so it wouldn't float away.

I was taking a nap before I went to my new psychiatrist (in addition to Dr. X). I was awakened by Thea. She wanted to talk. I said, "No, I haven't got the time." I started to try to find my clothes to get dressed. Howard walked in. I was naked, looking for my underpants in my suitcase. There was lots of junk in there but I couldn't find the right pair of undies. I was nervous, trying to talk to Howard. I asked him why he was here. Thea left. He said he wanted to talk. I said, "Uh huh! I can tell you want to get back together again." I was struggling with my undies (with holes in them and bras). He said, "Ya." His marriage isn't good. She tells him to be at this meeting and get ready for that party. I said, "Oh, I get it. You want me back because I didn't tell you what to do. No, I was too passive to speak up. You want that back." He reached for me and I pushed him away. "I've got to get ready." He was telling me how rich he was now, and I was thinking that means I'd be near the kids again and I'd like that. I said, "I'd really like to talk without us being angry about the kids. I want to be with them more." He pulled me down on the bed and wrapped his arms around me. He felt warm and I was aware of my soft skin. I layed still, like a rabbit, caught. Part of me wanted to relax and like him, the rest of me was angry at him. He would never change, he would never really hear me. I pretended to go to sleep. He gently picked me up and rotated me across him to the other side of the bed and layed around me softly. Then he gently picked me up and layed me on the floor. I let all this happen, aware of the softness of skin, warmth, and some anger because he was manipulating me. He'd like to make love to me on the floor. I "woke" up and got my clothes. He had music going on the stereo. It annoyed me and made me nervous. I went to turn it off, but I couldn't. I turned all the buttons but it wouldn't stop. I then realize it was the radio on the other side of the room. I yell at him to turn it off (a helpless anger). He laughed and then did so. I looked for my clothes. The girls came in. I really was happy to see them. I felt in a time bind. I said, "I could cancel my appointment," but then decided not to. I asked Howard, "How long will you be here because I'll be gone until 4:00." He said, "Until 6:00," looked at me, smiled and said, "Until 9:00." I said, "Oh, good. I mean, I really want to see the girls." I was vaguely aware that I was also wanting to see him. I started to leave. I explained to the girls, "I'll be back soon." They walked with me. Then I couldn't remember where the psychiatrist was. I looked for his address. I finally found it. I left. I looked for the van. I couldn't find it. I finally spotted it and then couldn't find the door to get in it. I got into the van. Thea and Jared came out. I told them, "Howard and the girls are at home." They'd probably like to visit (they are my neighbors). Then I tryed to get into the van, only it was a drawer that goes into a hospital bed. I took off my shirt and felt naked with Jared there. I looked for the hospital gown. I felt nervous. Then Jared said, "Why don't we drive you to your appt?" I sighed with relief and knowing I could do it myself easier, I agree. Then we were in the elks. They said goodbye to some drunks at their table and then we started to go to their car. (694 words)

I was in New York City. Some earthquake had struck. I was going to go into the hospital both to help others and to be a patient. The windows were broken out. There were big mud blots on the outside of the building. A broken water pipe was gushing into one of the rooms. I thought, "Huh, someone could drown." To get into the building, I was being pulled up, hanging by my hands to 2 ropes. It was a sky scraper, very tall, metal and glass. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to hang on, but I did get to the top floor. I got in and checked myself in. Then I was walking out. My kids were waiting. I heard the doctor ask me, "Is the black man or the blossom still there?" (meaning my husband). I reopened the door I had just gone through to answer his question. When he had asked the question, he sounded like he cared. But when I answered, he was talking to 2 other men. I thought, "Uh huh, ain't that how it always is. He doesn't care." I then ran down the stairs, 2 flights. My feet were fast. It was joyful. Then, I was at home. I was going to sit on the couch (chair, room for only one). My father came into the room. He wanted the couch. I think, "O.K., he's first, mom's second and I'm third." I went to another chair. My mother appeared young. She was playing the violin. She was embarrassed and tried really hard. I looked to see that her parents were there and she was trying to please them or catch their attention. My father shushed her. She kept on playing, only she had tried to stop. She had put the bow down and was just fingering the notes. My daughter was pulling the bow across the strings. It was not a good sound. (322 words)

A white kitten with human-like eyes (male). I carried it everywhere with me. I carried it and petted it and held it in a hood of my sweatshirt to carry it around. I heard bombs exploding from a distance. I saw the white explosion spots. I was appalled. "Look what they are doing to the landscape, ruining it." I looked overhead and saw Nazi planes. A bomb fell near us. I jumped for cover, but my parents are complacent and didn't. I came back. There had only been a small explosion. I was confused. Why hadn't it exploded and hurt us? A convoy of trucks and jeeps then came by. A nazi officer got out. He looked at me and told me that I was under arrest. I was to report to headquarters. I asked, "Where is it?" He said, "Follow me." So the kitten and I walked along. He went too fast (the officer), and I lose him. I didn't know where headquarters was, so I asked directions!! It finally dawned on me that I could escape, that I was being really silly following orders, so I got in a car and started driving. I was now a race car driver. It was a red and black, sleek race car. I drove fast. I now had a male partner. There was lots of competition. They didn't like me. They made snide remarks. I looked in my engine. Someone had put papers in there to start a fire. I got them out. I saw another race car driver getting ready to start. I stopped her (Lindsay, I think, blind). I checked her engine. The same thing. I got the papers out. I saved her. I got back into the car on the passenger side. I said to my partner, "I should let you start sometimes, even though I know I'm a better driver." He was tinkering under the hood. I got a wrench to help. I didn't know what I was doing and I shrugged my shoulders (embarrassed), that I even pretended to know. He drove for awhile. We then stopped. I said, "Are you tired yet?" I was hoping it was my turn. He said, "My body's tired, but my mind is O.K." We changed places." I drove very fast. He said, "Watch out for policemen." I nearly bumped into the tail lights of other cars as I was watching for policemen. I then decided I could probably out run them and I hit the gas. I drove over obstacles, around them, I'm good. The other drivers were in awe. One had a 1/2 hour head start on me and I was passing. The mountain road then turned into hallways and stairs. Then I was back outside. I stopped for a break. A woman who was angry at me picked me up to carry me to my car. She had her hand on my butt and pinched hard. I got angry and tried to kick her. Every time I hurt her, she hurt me back. I felt helpless (trapped) and angry. I got loose, drove my car. (518 words)

I was at a swimming pool. A woman is sniffing. "I smell smoke," she says twice. I think, "Huh." A man is concerned because he likes her but doesn't feel that he wants to give up smoking. I then get into the swimming pool at the shallow end. It is pretty pedestrian, so I start moving toward the deep end. I get to the rope and decide to brave it. I swim underwater. I open my eyes and see everything clearly, as if I weren't underwater. I see the feet, legs and tummies of the swimmers on top of the water, and the water swirling as they go through it. I then realize that I need to breathe and look up. I am way down deep. I start to swim for the surface. It's hard. About half way up, I feel the pressure in my lungs and can't help myself. I take a breathe. I'm aware that in reality I'd be drowning, but I'm O.K., I'm not drowning. (168 words)

I am in a movie theater eating popcorn. I find a coupon. I have won a prize. It's a big one. I get up to go to the candy counter. I realize that I left my purse at the seat, so I "conjure" it up. I ask the lady at the counter what my prize is. She shows me the picture on the coupon. It's a grill, lots of food. I ask her to repeat; she speaks but I can't understand the words. It's something about a scholarship to a college. I look up to see my Aunt Esther and Dora. I'm delighted to see them and I say, "Oh, How nice to see you. It's been a long time." We chat. Then I go outside. There is lots of water. I'm standing on a dock. I see 2 lines of relatives. Uncle Lionel has a white handkerchief over his face (lower half). He has an allergy. Some of my relatives get into a boat and drive away, across a wooden boundary between 2 bodies of water. Uncle Lionel is shocked. "I'd never be such a fool as to do that." Then my father gets into a small row boat and I get in. He slowly and carefully goes over the wooden boundary. The motor gets caught. My father says "Uh-oh." I say, "Don't tell me uh-oh, when we're in deep water." We then get over the thing. Then I'm in a canal. An Indian guide is behind me paddling. He is reciting the legends of our people. I feel like I'm going home. (264 words)

Earthquake. I'm at college. I know it's coming. I get out of the building and stand in a clear space. I see "downtown" buildings across the street. It hits. The top story of the building opposite me slides off (half the building), backwards, away from me. I'm relieved. A building with many people screaming in it, fear in their faces. It slides down the street into another building. People fall and are killed and hurt. I see Stan. I'm a little glad. I give him the name of Williams. I see or "feel" a building down the block fall forward into another building. I feel sick. My children are there, and so is Howard. I'm standing in a crowd. I go to see if my children are O.K. They are. I'm relieved. Howard is O.K. I'm "sort of" glad. Grudging. (140 words)

I was on duty doing registration on a river boat. I am dressed in an English "bobby" policeman costume. A young man likes me. He wants to kiss me and take me out. I am flattered. We go to the back of the boat to watch an extension raft that has Dixieland musicians. I pat my new haircut and want my "bobby" helmet that I left somewhere. He says, "Don't worry, you don't need it." I say, "But I want it." It appears on my head. I pat it. The banjo player is central in the group. They have some difficulty staying on the raft. I agree to go out with the man. I suggest we exchange addresses. He agrees. I get teased by other counselors about my affair, but they are supportive. (133 words)

I have died and gone to heaven. I'm confused. I'm not too sure where I am or what to do. It's a check-in counter. A tired woman (overworked) asked me if I used too many credits (like overdue books). I say, "No. If anything, I've used too few," (I feel a little guilty, like I'm lying, maybe). She has a file folder to check later. Cory is standing next to me. He has died around the same time I have. She gives us our instructions. We will now go live in the clouds. If it is too crowded, which it is getting to be by now, we will move on out into space. I feel some hesitancy about doing so. I don't want to yet. She says, "It's permissible to return to Earth and visit people. It is forbidden to make yourself known to the living. However, some of them are very sensitive and will feel our presence." I go back to Earth and sort of curl around some people. I want to hang around the ones that feel my presence and miss me. I find it hard to pull away from them. (193 words)

Barb Sanders:#0155 (11/24/80)

Nate, his wife and his mother-in-law stopped by the house (my grandmother Agnes' house). We talked like acquaintances. I was nervous. I started helping with her Christmas cards. My daughter Paulina, was making some books. She asked me to read the instructions. I was knitting. Nate kept being around me and I was nervous for fear that I would give away our relationship. Her mother watched us closely. It was hard to concentrate on what I was doing. Paulina got mad at me because I hadn't listened to her closely enough and she made smaller books. I said, "But they are lovely. I thought that's the size you said." She was appeased. I kept writing addresses on cards. There was a homemade house (miniature) with mice and hamsters in it. There was no cage or screen, just the make of the front kept them in. One of the mice wore a red and white polka dot handkerchief on her head. I commented on the nice workmanship on the house. As I was doing the cards, the mom came to me and asked, "Are you in love with Nate?" I stammered and acted like righteous indignation. I said, "See this house we're in? My Aunt and Uncle have lived here since before I was born." I pointed to the places I used to play. "They've been remodeled haven't they?" asked Nate. It was done up nicely. Where horses and crumbly barns used to be, now there was interior decorator "house beautiful" barns (stone) and lawns. I finished the cards and started to leave. I got my cards and their cards mixed up. I stopped, embarrassed. "Oh, dear," I said, "I forgot to separate them." I did that. Nate hovered near me all the time. At one point, he pinched my arm and I jumped and said, "Don't touch me!" I felt caught. The cards turned into a pile of clothes, the arms of things kept falling and I kept trying to contain the pile. I started walking back to my grandmother's house. I told Nate what she had asked me. I felt she liked me some. There were bramble bushes, gravel, a white goat that eyed my pile of clothes with interest. I struggled to get home. I was almost there. Some watchers commented on me. I had to step on top of tables to get to my destination. (398 words)

Abner, my cousin, is going to get married (only it's sort of Cory). He asks my girlfriend and me (probably Bonnie), to get the wedding ready for him. We go to the chapel but it's terribly crowded. Someone is having a wedding just before his time. We go around to the side door and peak in. Then we sneak through a skinny door to the banquet area, to get that prepared. Lots of people are there eating. They don't like us there and ask us to leave. I'm somewhat embarrassed. I try to quietly leave through the skinny door but my hand keeps getting caught in it as I try to shut it. Cory is there. He's wearing bright red lipstick. So is Bonnie. I apologize that we can't prepare before. I get butterfly feelings in my tummy because I will be a bridesmaid and have to stand up there in front of all those people (like old crowd anxiety). Cory says, "Never mind. It's O.K." We go out into hall. He has a large "baggie" with clothes in it. He says he has perfected a calming thing. If you swallow it, you will be calm, peaceful, and relaxed. I say, "Even me? Huh. I'm never like that." He says, "Even you." Then I say, "But will I be able to do anything? I don't want to be so calm that I can't do things that are interesting." He says, "No problem." He has 2, one for art and one for writing. I want the art one, thinking art is writing also. He says, "It doesn't matter." (267 words)

I was chair of a committee. I was getting people's names and phone numbers. We were in a nightclub. Some applesauce liquor was poured into my soda. Each member of the committee got a different color liquor. Some tough men, older Mafia types came into the club and complained because there was no entertainment or booze. It was too high brow. I soothed them down. Suddenly, some woman was on stage. Her back was to the audience, doing the bump and grind. There was beer and wine on sale. The place was a seedy joint. I felt badly about the entertainment. I went down the stairs to the dressing room. I put on makeup and an evening dress. I got up there and sang my heart out. They liked it. It was classy. I came back out. The owner was gruff. He was ordering his help around in a mean way. They were pissed at him. There was a commotion at the door. Some blacks were crashing, and the whites got up to leave. It was riot city. I jumped up and said, "Wait. We can all work it out." I ran to the stage. The men grabbed me and started to pick me up and carry me up the stairs. I pleaded, "No please, don't! You'll hurt me! You're all angry; I can do it myself." The men said, "The boss told us we have to. We don't want to, believe me." I started ordering everyone. I told the boss he'd better shape up and treat people nicely and he might get better results. He was shocked and started to argue. I stopped him. He glowered and then agreed. I told the men to carry me to the stage and I'd introduce them to a nice blonde woman, "Sandra," who was rich. They were surprised and then got nice and agreed. They got me up on stage. People were walking out. I got the mike and said, "Wait. You're gonna miss something neat if you leave." I started belting out "I am woman." I pushed the curtain back so I could play to the whole club (arena-like stage). I saw on the left, a red plush banquet set up. No one was there. Everyone started dancing and enjoying themselves. Blacks, whites, men, and women, all together. I was the pivotal peace maker. (393 words)

I was in an office. My student helper was assisting me getting some info I needed. I seemed to start on an errand but I would forget something and not be able to complete it. Then, an old man walked in, the boss. He was upset. He wore red silk pajamas tailored like a suit. He took them off to show red veins marked on his legs. They went to the heart, like a blood poisoning line. He was scared. He was in poor health with a bad heart and this meant he was going to die soon. I assisted him into his office. I called the doctor. I had some trouble getting his name (Rexford), and trouble dialing the number. A secretary found the number for me. The man was scared and moaning, lying on the floor in front of the desk. The secretary left the room and then a girl came out of the closet and exhaled lots of smoke. She was almost caught smoking and had hidden. She thanked me for not squealing. I nodded. Then the doctor came on the line. I told him what had happened. The doctor was crying, distraught. I said, "Is there anything I can do for him?" The doctor said, "Oh yes, there's lots you can do. Give him some milk." I looked around the room. I saw a glass of milk on the desk. I thought about giving him a breast, but I had no milk. I went back to the desk and got the milk. I talked to him as I went, soothingly. He said, "I don't want any milk." I said, "If you drink your milk, I'll give you a kiss, a French kiss after every gulp." He said, "Then I'll drink a gallon." I then found a bottle of beer. I took that to him. I asked the doctor if beer was O.K. Maybe the beer, or my kisses, would be too much and he'd die. The doctor said, "The beer is fine." I asked the man how old he was. He looked at me and said, "10 days old." I said, "Huh?" He laughed and said, "You've been here 10 days and I feel like I was born when I met you." (376 words)

Patsy and I are going to rehearse for a scene for a play. I get on her shoulders, my long skirt dropped over her head. I worry she'll smell a vagina odor. We walk around like that. We're in a big office. I'm an employee there. It's my office. (49 words)

I am asleep in my office. I think I have the door shut. I'm very tired. I wake up and realize the door was open and probably people had walked by and seen me asleep on the job. A man walked up to the door and asked to come in to speak to me. I was on a couch. I said, "Come in," trying to be professional. I folded up the blanket and set it aside. I saw that the room was crowded with furniture, my desk, the couch, a school desk and a chair. The man spoke with an accent, Spanish I think. He seemed shy. I had difficulty understanding what he said. He said he was a representative of the telephone company and wanted to have an explanation of the MMPI. He showed me a letter that had a picture of people on it (drawn), and the statement 75%, one out of 4 makes us be this way (employers were complaining because their sick employees blamed them). I said, "Ah." I asked him his name. He said, "Don Juan Sanchos." I wanted to call him Paul. He had sad eyes. He seemed intense. I said, "I'll have to ask my supervisor as this is privileged information. I think it will be all right." I stepped out of the office and into Dylan's office. I said, "There's a rep from Ma Bell and he wants to see the MMPI manual. He seems legitimate. He wants to know about the 1 in 4 %'s." Dylan went to the counter to get the test. He said, "Someone else wants to see it too. Shall you do it or I?" "I could do it. I've done it once and I have taken a class. But I'd like you to do it. I'll watch and learn more." He agreed. I went back to my office. One of the desks was now a bed. It was like a dorm room (3 beds). I told them what happened and that Dylan would tell us out in the hall. Don Juan and Paul started whispering and giggling. I sat on the bed with my long skirt flowing around me. I said, "What is it?" They say, "Oh, nothing." I go to the bed directly opposite where they were sitting. Paul moved, so it was Don Juan and me. I adjust my skirt since as I plopped down on the bed. I had lost balance and fell back some, showing my feet and underslip. I giggled. I looked at Don Juan intently (counselor) and said, "Something's on your mind. I won't start the MMPI until you tell me." I lean forward; we are very close. He's shy and whispered, so I lay my head on his arm to hear better. It was a very soft and intimate moment. Soft laughter bubbled inside me. He whispered, "I'd like to ask you out on a date." I smiled and said (into his arm with a coy glance at his eyes), "The sooner the better." We laughed. (Before, he'd mutter and I'd say, "What," and he'd say, "Oh, nothing," but I knew what he said. "You didn't tell me you could walk"). My wheelchair was parked over to the side of the room. We went out into the hall. Chairs were set up. A whole class was in there. The only place to sit was on the same chair with Don Juan. It felt nice. We watched and listened as Dylan explained the test. He started by saying, "The mid-line in the eye is very important," and went up to a girl in the front row (she's shy). He examined her eye, nose to nose. It looked funny and we laughed (I remember having done these kinds of funny gestures in a skit). Later, I was going across campus (like L or University). I was thinking, "Where would be the best place to park my van so I have the least amount of walking between classes. I have one class in the Math building, one in the Home EC building." I then went to the "women's center office." Andrea was there. I told her of Don Juan. She said, "He's been here before, you know." Then I remembered that a year ago, when I was sick and in the chair, he came asking for the same information. I shared that I thought he came back because he liked me and I proudly told how I had been able to speak out and tell him that I'd like to go out with him, and then I felt a little badly because I remembered that I was still being passive. I hadn't set up the details of when we'd go out. I had been indirect again and I felt sure he'd pursue it. (801 words)

I have a small part in a play. Ginny plays the mother; I play the young daughter. We rehearse it. I talk to others about the fact that I have this part. I feel some sense of consequence because I have a part. Opening night comes. Ginny can't make it. I get there and realize that I have not attended one rehearsal. Now I'm embarrassed and guilty. I don't know when I come on, or my stage blocking. I go into the women's room, which is a dressing room. Men and women are there. I have to go to the bathroom. I'm embarrassed. I sit on a toilet with no covering stall. Desmond is putting on make up and he looks over at me. I feel embarrassed because my bare butt is showing. He speaks to me. I say, "I need to find the director." The play starts. Ethan is in the audience already. I see a man who is like a stage manager. I go to him and tell him who I am. He comes with me to another room down the hall to hear me do the part. I start to sing. He's interested in the voice quality, but I forget the words. I make excuses. I say, "I can't think why I didn't attend any rehearsals, oh I know, I was sick. I had a cold for a week and a half." I laughed nervously knowing there is no excuse to miss rehearsal. I'm amazed he's still considering me to go on. Ginny shows up. She's late and disorganized and not ready. The man says, "Practice and we'll see." (272 words)

I'm crawling up some stairs. I have roller skates on my feet, wire rim glasses on and I carry a white, collapsible cane. A man asks me if I need help. He uses sign language and yells like I'm deaf. I'm annoyed with him and explain that I'm not totally blind, it's just my periphery vision that's gone. I go on my way. I'm shopping. I'm in a large department store, like Payless. My daughter Dovre is around but I can't see her. I remember that I'm going to meet her. I skate past many aisles of merchandise. I skate into the restaurant. I see several empty tables but decide to eat later. (113 words)

I am in the wilderness with a man (he's like Clint Eastwood). There is some attraction but I don't trust him so I rebuff him, and keep him at a distance. He starts to make love. I say, "Don't, I'm not interested in just sex, I want you to care about me." We're a little frustrated and angry with each other. I look up. There is a big hill and a cave. I go through the cave entrance and inside the cave is an open, grassy warm, hillside. The top of the cave opens to the sky. I have to travel to the top of the mountain to see what's on the other side. I go there. There are rooms. Some people are there. I don't trust them but they seem to be the ones that can transform me to a better being. One starts operating on me. He cuts me open. I'm now watching the operation near by. He messes around with my organs. I ask the person being operated on if it hurts, as they are awake. He or she says, "No, I've got acupuncture, and I don't feel it." It looks awful, blood and guts. The head is worked on. The person can now see and understand better. I step outside to see what's on the other side of the mountain as I'm now at the top. Fog, unclear, a sense of cold, and some uneasiness. (239 words)

I was going camping, out by a river. 2 very tall giants were out there and they were trying to kill me. They were facing each other and I was running for cover between them. The only cover I could find was in the leg or the big toe of one giant. One giant killed the giant I was hiding in (or very near), and that giant killed the other one. They both fell to the ground. I crept out and lay down between them to sleep. Then the 2 giants were regular people, 2 men and a woman. We had no blankets and it was getting cold. The girl was complaining to her mate. We talked about the coldness of the river near by. I felt the cold of the air. I said, "I have a van (VW bus) near by. I have blankets. I'll get some." I did so. Then I was washing the VW bus with a hose of cold water (from the river). I was referred to as the "big Mama." I had power in the group. They listened to me. It was time to drive away. I did so. I am watching the bus leave. The tires were on the absolute edge of the precipice as I turned the vehicle around, but no problem. I saw the tire tracks right on the edge. (228 words)

I was asleep in my bed at home. I was in a deep sleep, the kind on the edge of waking, just after you've fallen asleep. I was aware that I was fast asleep and meditating. My body slid to the side of the bed; I was in danger of falling out. My arm draped over the edge and my hand hit the floor. I felt it. I became afraid and wanted to wake up so I wouldn't fall and hurt myself. I decided to relax and flow with whatever happened. Then I was in an unidentified room sitting up but my body wasn't there. The only things in my room were a window and a chair. I felt myself growing smaller. The room got bigger and bigger. The chair got taller and taller until I was so small, I was the size of an insect. I then realized that if there were a spider in the room, I'd be so small it could really hurt me. I started growing bigger, out of fear. I began filling the room. I raised my arms skyward and I was as big as the Earth. My hands reached out clear into the stars. Suddenly, I saw a pair of hands holding my hands and I heard or sensed the statement, "I'm here." I feel overwhelmed with what I'd done, and retreated back to my sleeping body. I was still not able or ready to wake up yet. I flew for awhile, higher and higher. I was aware of a sense of height and that I'm afraid of heights in reality. I saw mountains and red and blue houses on farmed lands. I enjoyed my feeling of flying. I came back to my body. I was not willing to wake up yet. The rest is hazy, meeting people at a meeting. (307 words)

I was a sort of narrator to the story of Dabney and Nancy W. It was a saga. Dabney went off across America. He knew how to fix things. He met a farmer and offered to chop wood. The farmer got mean and tried to run him off the farm. He got his own axe and they had a "chopping" contest. The table they were chopping on was a beautiful dining room table. Then the farmer was outraged. Dabney fixed the table as if it hadn't been chopped. I was explaining to the farmer that he was very good and could do this. Another farmer came by and saw this. He asked me if Dabney could make a display case for his lintings (like lithographs). I said, "Sure he can." By now, Dabney was a baby about 10 months old. I carried him around but he was still capable of doing all these craft things. Now we were in the farmer's house. The baby had grown up. Now he was a younger brother and he was sort of me. I was also the sister and his older brother. The younger brother came to me and told us that he was in love. He had met this nice girl. We laughed and teased him. "How long have you known her?" "Oh, 2 days." We laughed. He went and got his tools to make the display case. A kitten slipped in the door. He scooted it out. Then a skunk came in. He carefully tried to get it out. It squirted him. 2 more skunks got in. He kicked them out. He complained to the farmer. The farmer got upset. The screen door was broken. A puppy got in. I got him back out. There were now kittens, mice, puppies and skunks out on the porch. A sea gull, wings spread, tried to soar in. I was fighting them off. A hummingbird got in. It threatened my face. (326 words)

I woke up later and saw the word "homosexual" or heard it. It was small. I thought, "Oh lord, no wonder I'm blocking." Then I thought maybe this means I am a homosexual, or just think I'm one, or afraid that I am one. I told myself to dream deeper. To explain more, that no matter what, I could handle it. It was better to live with no blocks, knowing myself as I truly am. Meanwhile, Nate had come over, really drunk, smelling of vomit and tried to make love to me. After he left, I had these dreams.

I was in a restaurant. 2 women were standing in front of me. One was saying to the other, "It sure is crowded...Oh look I see a spot. Do you mind if we sit at separate tables?" The other woman replied, "Yes, I mind. I don't want to be alone." Then the other woman saw a spot, near a man. She said, "Look, a man, over by the man. We can sit there." I was embarrassed and walked past them. I was looking for the restroom. The place was crowded. I walked to the back of the room. A long line of men were waiting for the men's restroom. I noticed there was no one waiting for the women's room. I thought, "Oh, because there aren't many women here." I walked past a bench with 3 men on it. They looked at me. I felt nervous and dropped eye contact. I had to step over 2 men in wheelchairs that were in the way. I went to the women's room. It was empty. I looked into the stalls. One was filled with vomit. I yelled out, "Nate!" all annoyed. He came in to fix the toilets. He flushed one. It worked and filled with clean water. He looked at me and I at him like, "Ah, good work." Then as he started to leave, it flushed again. We could tell by the sound that it was going to overflow. I looked around for someplace to sit, to get my feet up. I sat on the sink. The sewage and water spilled out on the floor and made a stream to the door, past me. Some women were coming in. I waved them to back up. I said, "Get out, this place isn't working." The water was getting higher. I thought, "If I stay here, I might drown," and then I knew that I couldn't, because the water was flowing out of the room. By now, I saw that the water was coming from a river, cold, clear water slightly contaminated with sewage. The water was waist high. George came up to me. He put his right hand to Andrea and with his left hand, he took my hand and pulled us into the water. We were going to swim for safety. I was a little annoyed. I didn't particularly feel I needed saving. He pulled me through the water. I tried to keep my cigs dry by holding them up and I tried to keep my head out of the water. When I kicked my feet or assisted, I got water in my face. When I let George pull, I was fine. We went through a door (the back of the toilet stall that had been a wall). A general in the army came up to me. I noticed that my feet touched bottom; the water was chest high. He looked at me with respect and compassion. He said, "After you get past this door, you probably won't remember much but that's for the best." His tone and face indicated I had been very heroic and had been through a difficult time. We swam along. He asked me what brand I smoked. I smiled. I said, "Salems." He said, "Oh, good." He had Salems and was so pleased he wouldn't have to offend me with a different brand. I noticed that the Salems he offered me were shorter. I said, "Oh, well, that's O.K." We swam into a lobby. I saw a young "Mickey Rooney" movie star. He was full of ego, asking people in a seemingly offhand way if they thought he was a good actor. Then someone said to me, "Have you seen the movie '2 soccors'?," a story of 2 women who heroically trained for a race, or to play the game of soccer. I saw the woman training, running straight up a tracked hill and the pain and the exhaustion on their faces. I admired their guts. Then I said, "I didn't like the movie because the movie featured the trials and tribulations of Robert Redford (a grown up Mickey Rooney), and only indirectly told the story of these brave women." Real sexist. I then saw Robert Redford up in a plane. It was about to explode and then it did. He reached back and picked up something and fell out. I thought, "Ugh, how awful to be falling to Earth and knowing that in a few seconds you'll be dead." A bunch of jet planes, with flames coming out of the after burners, saw him fall and turned in formation to get to him. I thought, "How silly. So many of them and they can't do any good." He crashed. I saw the jet land and was amazed how fast they could land. Then I walked back to the restaurant and the dream cycled over again. (811 words)

I am in acting class, during a break. I'm outside. I notice a commotion and see that Desmond has come back to town. He's greeting friends. He sees me. I smile. He holds out his arms to hug me. I walk into the hug. I feel slightly uptight and glad to see him. I say, "There's a chair near where I'm sitting. I'll clear it off for you." He says, "Great." I've got books all over it. I clear it off. I'm chewing bubble gum. I'm on the floor picking up books and papers and my mouth keeps filling with saliva. I am aware that he is preparing to show the class his scene that he left town to do. I look up. He's doing a male strip tease. He has an earring in one ear. He does a satire on stripping with a mild bump and grind. He runs to the audience. It looks like he's running to me and then he goes on to other members of the class. He dances around a large fat man. Then, 2 girls bring a pile of sheets and hold it around him so he can change his costume. (197 words)

A girlfriend and I went to an old high school wrestling match (like a reunion). I thought Darryl might be there. I watched others wrestle. One very big man and another littler man play "wrestle." They ran up to the bleachers where I sat and play wrestled around me. I pretended to stand between them. Everyone laughed. I saw Darryl. He was sitting on other bleachers with other wrestlers. He came over to talk. We kissed twice, like old friends who were a little ill at ease. I remembered him saying, "It was O.K., wasn't it?," (our past together). I said, "Sure." I told him, "It was lucky they had good doctors in this town. My appendix broke in E City and no one could fix it, so I had to come back to the old home town and they fixed it. That's why I happened to be at the matches." It was snowing outside the doors (the entire wall) was open. I asked if they could be shut. Darryl's mom asked pointedly if I wouldn't be leaving soon and maybe it'd be a bother to have to open them again. Darryl shut them. Then I went downstairs to get a couple of hamburgers to eat and realized it was 10 of 1 and I was late to pick up Paulina. I handed the raw hamburger patties with catsup on them to a woman and said, "I'm late and have to go. Can you give these to whoever is in charge?" She was perturbed at me and wanted to know why I didn't do it myself. I felt guilty and realized I'd done it again. I played helpless. I started to leave. The stairway was now a rough wooden beam I had to shinny up. I was getting splinters in my legs and it was difficult going. Then, I'm in my van looking for the freeway and I'm in a hurry. (321 words)

Claire K (a client) got engaged. She asked me if I was sad because she was engaged. I said, "Yes and no." Yes, because she'd now be busy with someone else all the time and no because it was good for her. She gave me a pair of glasses to give to her daughter, quick. Her daughter would get sick and cause earthquakes or something if she didn't have her glasses on. I went in to the counselor meeting. Lucy was playing pool and all the counselors from the community college were there in a meeting. I stepped in front of Lucy to put the glasses on her. She peered at me. I put them on her. She said, "Ah, you're Barb Sanders." The other counselors looked up at me (they were sitting), then she looked at all of them. "Now," she said, "You'll all have to say your names again so I'll know who you are." I saw Co-worker Tyler looking at me. I felt sad. I left the meeting. I felt like I'd lost my friends. I lamented to Claire, "I could have been in that meeting with them all night and enjoyed them, but I can't now. It's all gone." Then I called Andrea to discuss my concern about Claire. She patched our call in with Susan G. Susan G disagreed with Andrea. She said, "No, there's too much dog," (counselor talk for dogma). Andrea gasped. She was wrong and couldn't believe it. I felt a kind of "gotcha" feeling. Then I was vigorously ironing a skirt with lots of wrinkles. A pleat (like in a skirt I made in Jr. High). I was doing a pretty good job but making a few more wrinkles with my somewhat sloppy vigorous ironing method. The hem was undone and unraveled (frazzled). (302 words)

Some man and I were chaperons or protectors of a group of adolescent children. We were in a jungle. There was a tribe out there in the jungle that was out to get us. I had 2 dogs to guard me wherever I went, a black one and a cream colored one. This man and I were very attracted to each other, in the throes of falling in love, but we were always involved with helping these kids. They were between us. Early one morning, I got up to take a bath on the porch. It was a rare moment of privacy. One of the adolescent boys woke up the man and suggested he take this opportunity to speak to me. He did. He approached me. We looked at each other. We were wearing bathrobes and mine was partially undone exposing parts of me in a seductive (innocent) way. I sprayed water on him from the hose and we laughed. He and I kissed. The dogs then got restless (not because of us but because they sensed danger from the jungle). The man and I were then captured by the enemy tribe (I never saw them), and taken away. Now we're in separate circles (like a hut, only there is no hut). I was naked, had long blonde hair I was tied up. I was eating food out of a dish like an animal. He snuck a message to me; it was written on computer print-out paper (the message was handwritten and in code). He started with "Dear Naked Girl: Couldn't help but notice." It was a joke and I smiled. I then broke my bonds and was able to escape. I had a choice. I could assist him to break his bonds and we could escape together, or I could escape and send back help. He urged me to go on and I agreed reluctantly because I'd be likely to get caught again if I went back for him alone. I traveled through the jungle. It was rough. I made it back and rescued him by sending back reinforcements. Then, I was in an office with lots of window spaces. I was on the phone talking with some sales person. I kept asking for his product; he kept sending defective ones to me. I refused to accept it and then he sent me another and it was also defective and I refused it. Finally, I got angry. I told him firmly that not only will I not accept this shoddy treatment but I shall officially complain to his headquarters. He was pissed and left the phone. A woman secretary responded to me. She tiredly agreed but said it was probable it won't do any good. I noticed my evidence was fading away and I felt frustrated and wanted to give up the pursuit. Then, co-worker Tyler came into the office. He, Kathleen and I were to have a talk. Tyler and I walked up a long stair case and sat on the top (like thrones on a roller coaster ride). Then Kathleen came up the stairs. Someone said that she did a great job rescuing Tyler in the jungle single-handedly but now she should apologize to Tyler for undermining his male ego. Tyler looked relieved and said, "Oh, good. I would really like that. It would help." I looked at him. I was surprised and sad because he was like all the rest and I thought he wasn't. Kathleen then approached slowly and ceremoniously. She bowed her head and said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." I stood up and said, "I'm sorry but I simply can't handle this. I'm leaving." I felt badly because of what was happening (both the scene and my leaving). I walked down the long steps and went into my office. I shut all the doors and windows and started pacing. I felt suppressed, upset, sad, and angry. I wanted to go back to explain to them why I had left, but I thought it was futile. I wanted to pack up and leave, but that would be quitting. Kathleen walked in. She was very angry with me. She lectured me and said, "Isn't it amazing how one little thing can put a stop to everything? And it's all over?" I said, "Wait, I want to explain." She snapped, "Explain? Tyler was ready. He wanted to get close. He said you should give up Ellie's estate because you can't handle her. He said you should not have changed your name and should change it back." I said, "He told you that?" I was half annoyed and half wondering what it all meant about Tyler and me. "Would he have told me that if I'd stayed?" She said, "You? No, He would have told Helen." I wondered who Helen was but sensed that it was someone like a wife he had. Kathleen slammed the door on me. I went to the bottom of the stairs and looked up. I saw Tyler talking to the man in the jungle. I wanted to go up and talk to straighten it out, but then I gave up. It was too overwhelming.

I had center coverage at 1:30 in the morning. The phone rang. It was Claire K, a client, then she changed to Ernie. He was threatening me. He was going to kill me. He was standing outside my locked door. I could see his feet through the crack at the bottom of the door. I quietly picked up the phone to call the police. The line was busy (twice). (69 words)

I dreamt that I woke up to see my daughter Paulina floating on the ceiling. She was naked, with long blonde hair, sleeping in a curled position. I got frightened and looked to my right to be reassured that Paulina was her regular little girl self asleep beside me. She was, and I calmed down. I had a sense of fear about this visualization, like I was seeing her/me in a past life. (73 words)

I was 21 years old. My father was Jerry Lewis. I was going to go to the show. He and I were very close. We were hugging and touching all the time. The thought "incestuous relationship" came to mind, but I dismissed it because it didn't feel sexual. It felt suffocating and cloying. He loved me so much that he needed to be near me all the time. He treated me like a child. I wanted to see a particular movie because of a good looking movie star. He refused to let me. He was jealous of my interest in this other man. I told him, "Hey, I'm 21 years old." He looked hurt and scared. He sneered and said, "If you see this man, I'll cut you off from my money. Ha! How will you support yourself?" I felt confident, strong. I said, "I have skills and talents." I listed some and added that I could type 70 words a minute and if I had to, I could be a clerk-typist. I wouldn't starve. I left him. I felt sad to leave him but I knew I must go to be free to grow. I traveled alot. I think I went to college. I was in a dorm room. A woman came in, young. She was going to help me and that would be a nice surprise for me, a gift. She was going to fix up my room. I hid in the closet. She talked to me even though she didn't know where I was. She came to the closet. She said, "I'm going to sort your clothes and I'll mend any that have rips in them." I hid in my blue bathrobe in the middle of the rack. She started at one end. She picked up a dress. It was frilly and small, like for a young girl. She said, "I don't know why you chose this dress. It was silly of you to do it. You could have had the other. It was better," (I think the other was a serviceable sweat shirt). I felt somewhat embarrassed and amazed that I had chosen the baby dress. She started telling me she was jealous of me because I could always do everything so well, and I always got everything she wanted. I felt badly for her. I came out of the closet to talk with her. Then I heard an awful buzzing. I looked at the window. There were giant bees that looked like chickens that had flown in the room. Their heads were in the room, but their bodies were still outside. They were dangerous. We got scared and decided to leave the room. As we got to the door, one got in. He flew out down the hall and I tried to shut the door and he flew back into the room and I got out of the room and tried to shut the door. The woman handed me a rifle. She said to kill it. It was a 3030 rifle. "This is the only size gun that will kill it." I started to take aim. A man (perhaps Howard), was holding the bee (now a cute black puppy), so I could kill it. I told the man to get out of the way. If I missed, he'd get hurt. He laughed. He had total confidence in my ability. He would not move. I couldn't get him to, so I took careful aim. The gun was covered with papers and a screw was loose. I tightened it up. It was complex and difficult, but I got the gun fixed. I took careful aim at the head of the bee/puppy and fired. I got it. It slowly died. It was awful to see. Then I went down the hall. My "father" was there. He was semi-laying on a waiting room bench. He looked old and ill, a dazed look in his eyes. He caught my hand and begged me silently to listen to him. He kept asking, "Why, why, couldn't I have loved that man? Why did I decide he wouldn't do for my daughter? Because of him, she left me." I soothed him and said, "Hey, you can't love everybody. It's O.K." He looked tired and sad. I looked into his ears. A white milky substance was in them. I was examining him like a doctor. Another doctor (male), came up to watch. My father looked "caught" and said, "Oh why are you here? I don't want you to know." The male doctor picked him up to take him to the hospital. He had had a stroke and couldn't make his legs work. As he was being taken away, a cart with many beautiful things from all different foreign countries was coming down the hall for him. They were gifts from his daughter who was returning from his (her?) many travels to see him. Funeral or mystery music followed the cart. (826 words)

There was a meeting. A woman was lecturing. She gave us papers and we tested ourselves on some language disorder (we didn't have it; we were counselors and needed to know about the new test). Rochelle whispered to me, "Shouldn't we ask her about her spinal disability?" I said, "No! Goodness, you know how you feel when people ask you personal questions." We argued. I then got a phone call. It was a client (Terrance). I answered the phone briskly. He stammered and said, "Never mind." I felt badly and tried to be supportive. He hung up. Rochelle and I continued to argue, so I went up to the lady and diplomatically asked her impersonal questions to find out if she had a spinal disease. She fielded it and never answered. I dropped it. I left. When I got down to the street, I looked up at the windows. Rochelle put signs and pictures indicating to the world that I was a bastard and an all together rotten person. I shrugged my shoulders but felt embarrassed, because the counselors would all see it. I decided it didn't matter. I went into building across street and into my room. Co-worker Tyler and other counselors were there. They had decorated my room with Xmas things. Tyler was smiling and saying, "2 years ago, we didn't have a chance to properly welcome you. So we're doing it now." It was pleasant. (238 words)

I was in a house, a ranch house. Paul Newman came in. We discussed what it was like when he took acting from the same teacher I am taking it from. He described doing real acting assignments in Hollywood. I was disappointed because all we do is rehearse and perform in class. I felt envious of his good experiences and sad that it still wasn't that way. As we were talking, a feeling of camaraderie developed. I then saw a flood rising outside. My rancher father was concerned because he'd have to ride out and see if it would threaten our ranch. I ran to the door and stopped him. I said, "Wait. I'm a better rider and lighter. I'll go." He refused. I said, "Are you afraid that if something happens to me, others will talk because I'm a girl and you should have gone." He muttered, "Ya." I got ready to go. I looked out the window. Water was swirling around. Paul Newman looked to the mountains and said, "It's not so bad." I drew him to the window and showed him. We were looking at the wrong place. He gave me his T-shirt to wear. It was too tight and he had to help me put it on. I was embarrassed. The water was rising and we had to escape out the window. We swam and found a high niche of ground and crawled up there. We kissed. There was a feeling of closeness. We really liked and respected each other. Then, the water receded and we had to go back. He and I were sad because we had to part. He was married and was in love with his wife. I got my horse and sloshed through the lowering water level back to the ranch alone. (300 words)

Nate dove into a pool and was caught by something strong and fierce, maybe a snake because he swirled and struggled in a downward struggle. I felt very detached. Then, I was sitting in my room and I heard a door in the back slam. Nate stumbled in clutching his stomach. He was in terrible pain. I went to him and he cried out in pain when I touched him. He said, "Call the hospital. I was attacked!" I was shook up. I tried to comfort him and looked for the hospital # in the phone book. I was looking in the yellow pages. I couldn't find it. I felt scared and frustrated. I talked to Nate. "It's going to be all right." He said, "Hurry, hurry, oh, the pain." I felt guilty because I realized that I had watched him struggle and didn't lift a finger to help him. I was also aware that the attack was meant for me. We were 1 block from the hospital. I said, "Can I help you over there?" He cried out, "No, get an ambulance because of the pain!," (possible internal injuries). I tried looking in the white pages, but I couldn't find it, and then I noticed the part of the pages in the "S's" had been tampered with. I felt ominous, like the attacker had done it. I tried the yellow pages again. In frustration, I called information. A tired woman came on and said, "I'll help you look for your number but I won't do it for you." I explained the emergency and she grudgingly agreed to find it while I was waiting. I said, "Oh, I guess I can't visit you because I'll run into your wife." He said, "Yes you can, I'll call when it's clear." (299 words)

I go to a meeting. I walk in. I bring co-workers Josh and Dylan in with me. I sit in a high backed office chair (that has a foot rest like Dr. X's chair). I sit in it to get hypnotized. My chair is facing to the right, perpendicular to desk. An old lady and a detective are on the bench with Josh and Dylan and look to the man behind the desk. I introduce, "Josh, Director of C. and Dylan, Coordinator of Counseling." The man behind the desk observes these guys with their titles and he introduces himself with some large title. Josh looks like his usual confused and uncertain self. Dylan looks supportive. I ask the man if he's done as I had asked, to find the person and all about him without letting him know anything about me. The detective and the old lady then took me to find this person. I don't know who it is (maybe my father). (163 words)

I am in bed with Paulina but it's my office. I'm asleep. I'm awakened because Claudia comes in and sits on my pillow. She wants to talk to me about her troubles. I awaken in a start and mumble, "I don't want to deal with you guys," (the C. department). She says, "Oh no, it's just my problem," and blabs on. Finally she leaves. I start to go back to sleep. Paulina twists and mumbles in her sleep. She "follows me" around on the bed in her sleep. She wants to be near me all the time. Then I'm aware that she has wet the bed. Then the door opens and Fletcher comes in. He's lost weight. He gives me a ring and a bracelet. I say, "What's this?" He says, "It's a token of my love for you." He has come to tell me he loves me. I feel uncomfortable because I don't love him. I say, "I can't accept these gifts," and he sits with his back to me at the foot of the bed and says, "Oh, don't worry, they're worthless. Just trinkets I picked up." I ask, "Are you sure?," (because I think he's lying and they are valuable). Paulina stirs. I worry about her hearing. I feel jealousy from her. Then Fletcher starts talking about us. He's come so we can be together now. I'm thinking, "Oh, wait a minute! What's going on here?" He brings in a wire rack with things hanging off it, a glove, roses on a hat. I look at them nostalgically. I say, "How nice it is to see old parts of costumes I used to wear in a play." I put on the glove. It's leather (and too big). I am enjoying the articles and the fond memories of plays on stage. I'm aware of counseling people listening in at the door. He's now sitting up at the head of the bed. I look at him and pause, and then I say "I don't love you." I'm aware then of my abruptness and worry about having hurt his feelings. I then say, "But I like you, as a friend." He grimaces but accepts. Then Paulina and I get up. An older couple is at the door. It's very windy and cloudy but they are going to give us a helicopter ride. I ask the man, "Is this safe?" He says, "Sure, no problem. The copter will go up over the winds and will have a safe journey." We get in. The winds are fierce. We go high real fast. I think, "Oh dear, I'm afraid of heights." I then look out and we're so high that I'm not scared anymore. It's fun. It's a smooth ride. We ride over the river and the clouds. We land on the other side (N City, I think). We stay for awhile and then go back. Now I'm in the bed again with Paulina and Fletcher is there. I say, "You'd better go. I think the hotel manager is listening in and he's out to get you." I go to the door and open it up. He's out there. He's a short man (the guy in Taxi on T.V). He's a meany, suspicious. We talk. I pretend innocence. Then Fletcher comes out. He says, "I'll see you later," and walks past us. The manager is very upset. He wants to strangle Fletcher. Fletcher is playing with him. Fletcher yells taunts or makes funny faces and then pretends to run. The manager tears after him and almost catches him and then Fletcher runs again to do it all over. I feel apprehension and yell at Fletcher, "Cut it out; he could really hurt you." Fletcher keeps it up. Then at the top of the stairs, the manager catches Fletcher and starts to strangle him. Fletcher makes an awful sound in his throat. Just then, I wake up because Paulina is snoring. (657 words)

I'm in an acting class. We have to chose a final scene. I chose a humorous monologue that has few words, most of it is gestures. I start to practice. There is a feeling of nervous performance energy. I get into my costume. I'm pacing and rehearsing. The owner of the tavern/acting instructor comes over to me. He has to leave for awhile. He asks me to take over temporarily. I am a little annoyed and surprised because I'm into my rehearsal. I agree. I go out to the table and sit down. The customers are watching the finals. A girl is up onstage doing her monologue. A drunk yells out, "Everybody be quiet, I want to watch her!" A man at the next table behind him yells, "The only one being noisy here is you!" The drunk gets up. He yells, "I knew some drunk would ruin it." He goes to the other man and pulls and twists his nose. A big fight starts. I think, "Oh no," and then I feel strong enough to handle it. I get up and firmly grasp one of the fighters by the shoulders and firmly tell him he has to leave. Even though the place is in an uproar, they hear me and start to calm down. I think it is ironic that I have to throw out the man who claimed he wanted it quiet and then started the fight. After he leaves, the boss comes back. He's asking me how it went and I'm telling him. While I'm talking, he sits in front of me and looks up at me with sexy desire in his eyes. I look very beautiful but my costume is satin cushions or pillows over the front of me. He is caressing those pillows tentatively like he'd like to remove them and touch me but isn't sure of himself in terms of how I would react. I am emotionally somewhat removed and just watching him.

I am having an affair with Pedro (dean at the community college). We are sitting at a luncheon table. I am in my wheelchair. I drive up to the table and my foot petal gets caught on the leg of the table and I cause the whole table to move. I am embarrassed and get wide eyed and cover my mouth with my hand. Someone named Mitzy gets squished a little and I ask her if she's all right. I have to go teach a class. Somehow, everyone has found out about the affair and I'm embarrassed. I decide to cancel my class, so at 3:00, I won't have to meet Pedro. However, I had ordered some books and they had just come in. Paulina and I go to the gym to get the books. The gym is in the same building as my class, so I sort of sneak in. I ask directions. I find it. I start looking for my sack of books. I see some needlepoint and I think it's mine. A lady comes up to me and asks how she can buy the books. I say, "Oh no, these are ordered. If you take some books you are taking them away from others." "Oh," she says, "I didn't know." Paulina and I leave. There is a big vicious dog, a German Shepherd with teeth barred. We run and get into the van so he can't get us. Some man in the van laughs and says, "Ha! So you think he's vicious, huh? I can handle him." He opens the door. I plead with him not to. He goes out there. I'm afraid. I shut the door so he can't get me and Paulina (the dog). I notice the keys are in the ignition and I feel a little safer. Pedro is with us now. Then a lady says she's going out there. The dog's been tamed. I plead with her. She goes. I hear the dog attack her, and rip her to shreds. Later, the coast seems clear, so Paulina and I scramble out of the van and into the building for safety. (357 words)

There is some sort of meeting. A bunch of male counselors and me. Hank, Tyler, some others and I meet on an island. This is our second meeting. The first one was five years ago. We greet each other enthusiastically. I'm talking to Hank. I'm reminiscing about the first meeting. I say, "Can you imagine, we had Nixon and XXX, his side kick, here. I say it somewhat hushed because I'm not sure if everybody feels the same way I do. I'm amazed that we'd have sickies like that in our group. (92 words)

I'm teaching class. One of my students is questioning something. I'm being patient. Co-worker Josh and Pedro come to see me. They are full of some news or concern. They show me a large board with metal bars displayed on it. These are the new bars for the jail. They strike the bars and musical notes sound. It's very pretty. They say, "But, well, radical Feminists." I say, "I don't understand." They look embarrassed. One says, "You know what we mean." I say, "No, I don't. Please explain." They start to explain but it's confusing. It's something about how awful it will be to have radical Feminists in the same jail as the physically disabled. Contamination, bad stuff. I am a little amused by them. I say, "I still don't understand." They say, "Wait, we'll get something and come back to explain." They leave. I feel that they are leaving to get more at ease so they can come back and not be so embarrassed. There are 2 metal boxes. They are hot. It's a train. A little girl gets out of one box. Then a metal tong reaches into the second box. Many letters and papers and money are pulled out. The metal tongs are necessary because everything in the box is so hot. The papers and financial stuff are cooling. There is a feeling that the little girl is poor and an object of fun. (237 words)

I wanted some ice cream. I bought some hot buttered rum, really syrupy and sugary. I took it home to the old house in M City. My mother saw it and said, "Oh, now, I'll pay for that." I said, "No, it's O.K. You don't have to pay me back. Just have some." But even as I said it, I knew she would pay me back and I would accept gladly. Later, I told my brother Dwight that my van wasn't running quite right. There was a loping in the motor sound. I said, "I guess I'll take it to be fixed. How much will it cost?" He said, "I'll do it for you and won't charge much." My mother wore blue jeans. (123 words)

I own a restaurant. I am supervising the cooking. I am making bread. It's easy for me to kneed the dough. I am aware that I couldn't do that "before" or in real life. I take a wooden board with a long handle and pull out beautiful loaves of bread, freshly baked. I put in new loaves of dough. They start to get tangled up. As I'm fixing it, word comes to me that a General has ordered one of my special breads, so I weave the loaves together and cook it. It is beautiful. I cut it open. There are interwoven tunnels in the white, feathery, textured bread. I pour melted butter down the tunnels. I am impressed with my own cleverness. I decide to carry it to the General myself. I am wearing a long silk, white evening gown. I am older (late 40's, early 50's), but looking good. I walk through the messy, busy kitchen. At the next room is the transition room from the kitchen to the fancy restaurant. I take off the apron and trade the wooden board for a silver tray with fancy napkins on it. I walk out into the restaurant. I ask, "What table?" It's either 21 or 12, I'm not sure. I go into a private room, lots of drunken people. As I look for the table, I'm thinking, "I hope I can find the table. Don't be silly, you own the place, you know where everything is." I find the General and start to place the bread in front of him. A woman in his party starts to take it away from me to do it herself. I politely but firmly insist I do it myself (after all, I did the work and I want the credit). She and I have a tug of war. Then I notice the General is very drunk. I point out to him all the tunnels and the butter but he is unimpressed. He's talking about his problems. He puts his arm around my waist and I sit on his lap. He mutters about how the people don't care anymore. He'll lose the election. He tried. He's fair-haired and for the other people, he got a minister that was dark "Rizzo-Egyptian dark," he kept saying. I realize then that he wasn't going to appreciate my fine restaurant, or order a big dinner (which I tried to sell him), or tell his friends about my place. My attitude was one of "c'est la vie," such is life. No hard feelings. Resignation. (425 words)

I dreamt I was in bed, here in M City. It is 2:00 am. I hear the football game playing on T.V. or radio. It's very loud. I'm amazed that a football game is on at that time. I'm also angry that my father is playing it so loud. Valerie, my sister-in-law, comes in to talk. We are looking at the same things on the bed, like Christmas gifts I made or something. We're talking. Then the football game is off but some T.V. program is on. I say, "Who's watching T.V.?" Valerie says, "Ellie." I say, "Oh ho. Send her in." Then I yell, "Hey Ellie, come here a minute!" She says, "No." I say, "Ya. I want to talk to you. Turn that thing off. It's too loud and it will wake grandma." She says, "No, it won't." My father is listening to the football game in their bedroom on the radio. Paulina wanders through. I'm talking about swimming. Oh, earlier I had dreamt that I was invited to go swimming at Peter M's house (he's a para, a student at the community college). He, his wife, and I were swimming in a small "hot tub" swimming pool in his backyard. There's some connection between his wife and Valerie, like they are the same woman. I think I was embarrassed because I could get up and walk and he couldn't, like he'd resent me or something. Anyway, I look at Ellie (I'm back in the bedroom in M City). One arm looks longer than the other, longer than mine, even. I say, "Come here. Let me feel your arm." She smiles, self-consciously and reluctantly comes over. I turn so I'm in front of her. I lay her left arm next to my left arm. It is quite longer than mine. I'm amazed. I call Valerie over to look. I then ask Ellie to reach both her arms out in front of her. She does so reluctantly. It's hard for her to move the right one. The left one is huge. The hand is huge. Then I push back the sleeve of her left arm and feel it. I am horrified to discover she has 2 elbows. There are some wrinkles, old age skin, and scars. Ginny and her son Ricardo come in with my mail from the P.O. box in M City. Someone says, "How nice. She picked up your mail." I say to her, "How can I have not noticed all these years that she has 2 elbows?" there is a sense of astonishment tinged with guilt and some distress because she's disabled now, but I'm not too worried about that. I am aware that she wanted to be unique in some way and has chosen this way. I look at the mail. There are 2 statements from the M City branch bank and a wooden board from the community college Performing arts with art work (3-d) on it, ceramic statues, carved wood, etc. I feel somewhat honored that I am considered part of the community college Performing Arts department. I guess I'm an honorary member. It's an election for officers. Directions are on the board. George and Greg are 2 names I could read. I have to lift up blocks of wood beside the name I am to vote for. I think, "George? He works for me. Oh, it must be a different George." (568 words)

Ginny and I have an argument. She's explaining something to me. I find it hard to listen. I then see she's saying and doing some incredible things. Things and words and colors are coming out of her mouth like vomit. I'm scared and concerned for her and I'm also upset because these things have meaning for me, to help me. I ask her what drug she's on. My brother Dwight is there. She says, "9." I ask Dwight what that is. She follows me around and won't stop. After what seems like a long time, I start to do it too. Suddenly I see dazzling, sparkling blue and red colors like fireworks or prism colors on the end of my tongue. Ginny's face goes out of focus. I am aware that I'm letting go and I'm in a different state of awareness. I talk rapidly, non-stop, and I'm vaguely aware that I might be saying hurtful things that could hurt other people's feelings, but I know I must and it's O.K. It spews out of me unchecked.

I'm in a large room. A sort of party is happening. There are lots of people. I know them. Some are counselors. One is reading a joke. I listen. It's about a bull. Suddenly I realize the end of the joke is "blue balls" and I say, "Oh!," and get up and walk out. I don't want to hear the rest of the joke. They laugh at me for my prudishness/innocence. I'm a little embarrassed (they are being good-natured, not mean). I go into the other room. I notice that they've changed the floor coverings. There used to be 1/2 carpet and 1/2 green linoleum on the floor. Now there's carpet in one and linoleum in the other. The linoleum is padded. I hear them tell another story/joke. I hear the words "wheelchair," and I think the other word is "free." I'm not sure. I'm interested and go back into 1st room. They laugh again because they knew my attention would be caught.

The girls and I are somewhere. I have a new cat. He's there to replace the other one. The cat's job is to hold things for me. I hold the cat (a half-grown kitten), and he holds the articles in question, some yarn and other things. He's new on the job and drops some things. He apologizes and says he'll get it. I suggest that if I hold him sideways to my chest, he will be more comfortable and will be able to hold the articles better. He agrees to try. I change his position. He's being held like a baby. His little paws are curled up over his fat little tummy. The girls and I are walking past a building. It's an apartment. I hear gospel singing. The windows shine with light. I am sneaking by quietly. I don't want to disturb my neighbors. I peek in and see blacks singing (women with bandannas on their heads). I enjoy the music but somehow feel drawn and simultaneously hold back from it. We go on.

I am given a cabin/house on a river. A man, rich, my neighbor up on the hill gives it to me. He watches me. I never see him. I always feel him watching me. There are lots of children, cats and dogs in this house. I am being artistic and making things. I am checking my horoscope. The man asks me to his house for a date. At first I am reluctant, but my teenage daughter convinces me it will be fun. I go to the bathroom to get ready. There are 3 bathtubs, all ornate, gold faucets, lots of mirrors, and bare walls. It's like I'm trying to create a mansion out of a cabin. There are a lot of different shampoos all different colors, each one vibrationally in tune with a different aspect of my chart. The bath tub is special; it massages away my arthritis. I get in and look in my mirrors. My hair is curly, white, and there are large bald spots. I am appalled. As I play with my hair, I pull some out. Then they grow longer and I put it back on my head and I'm O.K. I dress up real snazzy. I go out on the back porch. I see men fishing in the stream/river. Work crews are fixing a road on the hill. My brother Jake is there, on the porch. I go back in. There are lots of teen age kids, some adopted. They are in a downstairs bathroom. A long line of cats in a catalogue. Each has a special shampoo for them. First, a white Persian gets a banana shampoo, then a gray cat gets a green one, and on down the line. Now they are real and one reaches out his paws and hugs the next cat's head, his green shampoo gets on the other one. Then my teen age boy/me says, "What next?," and opens the door to the other bathroom (I think I was just observing this). A young boy is in there. The boy/me says, "Well, heavens, when I was your age, I was in the bathroom a lot too, but not with a girl," as he sees a young girl. The other boy says, "Yes, but see she's a XXX girl (meaning before puberty, no breasts, very boyish but pretty). The boy/me says, "Well, at least XXX isn't giving me any trouble. He's new to the family. I adopted him." Just then, we hear him upstairs crying out, "Stop it Yerg, stop it!" The boy goes upstairs and I follow. Lots of kids are up there. The young adopted person is upset because Yerg (a dog), is stepping on his art papers. I call Yerg to me (backwards for grey). He is a young man, dressed in a suit shirt and tie. I say, "You have to stop that. You are a dog." Yerg bends over and pats my head. I find it difficult to explain to him that he's a dog, not me. That's what I'm supposed to do to him. He seems confused and offended. The kids plead with me to just like him be as he is, and not insist he be a regular dog. (536 words)

I'm at work, which is like a set of bleachers. I talk to a lot of people, and go to a meeting about dial-a-bus. My cousin Terence comes driving back into town. He comments to me that he thinks he'll hang out around town for the winter and maybe permanently if the XXX industry will get its act together (furniture or construction). Terence is also sort of my brother Dwight. I'm glad he's around. He travels so much. A race car with a man, chubby, with a guitar and some woman comes to town. He sets up for a concert. I am getting some of my clothes that are laying around the bleachers as he is setting up. I ask someone where the blue bag of clothes is. She says, "Over there." As I go to it, the man with the guitar steps his foot in it as he is playing and singing. I get down on my knees and look up at him and politely ask him to move. He does so. I pull out various turtle neck sweaters. He is singing "Ghost Riders in the Sky." I sing along with him. He hears me and starts singing the high part. I sing real low, at the lowest edge of my voice limit. I forget some of the words. The women just look at me, like I'm infringing on this man's concert. He's being somewhat patronizing and I'm showing off, hoping someone will notice my nice voice. (248 words)

I am getting ready to do a scene for acting class. Paulina and I gather up my props, which involve a lot of clothes, a rose, and other things. We are walking across a wooden foot bridge with a huge river underneath. Most everyone else is walking the longer and safer, lower zigzag path beneath the straight path I'm walking. A heavy wind is pelting the footbridge and it is swaying. It is hard to maintain my footing. I fall against the rope railing. My props, some of them fall to the foot bridge around my feet. A man stands before me. He looks searchingly into my eyes. I am annoyed with him. I'm ready to refuse his offer to help me. Then I see that I need his help. He asks and I accept. I turn to Paulina and say, "Why am I so abrupt just before I need help? It's a good thing I didn't say anything." We all make it to the auditorium. The young man and I do our scene, except for the last part. Then someone else does theirs. I have to go to the john, so I find one. There are 3 toilets in one stall. 2 are broken. One is like my wheelchair. I step around it. The other is to my left. When I sit on the 3rd toilet, it is broken and has red things floating in it (like red glass, thin twisted rods). I realize I mustn't go to the bathroom because I'm in my bed, dreaming. I get up and go back to the auditorium. It's time to finish my scene. I am now sitting in my wheelchair watching the young man give his lines. I suddenly realize I shouldn't be just watching, I'm supposed to be in character, listening, and I have some lines coming up. I feel panicky because I can't remember the lines. Somehow it ends so I don't have to show my mistake. I go off to read my lines so I can remember them. An old roommate then does a monologue on stage; she asks me to be backstage for moral support. Paulina and I walk back there and we lie down near the curtain so no one will see us. We can see them. They are a long way down. My old roommate does her scene. It involves a little girlish/woman who is sweeping the dirt off the step. She speaks a few lines. It could be better. Ethan and the rest of the class call out suggestions for her. One plays music that sounds like a trumpet on her mouth. Soon we have a musical bit. The class comes up to dance in unison, and the curtains keep opening wider and Paulina and I must keep retreating, back and back to stay hidden. I want to join the musical but Ethan looks at me and I know the answer is no, because I can't dance. The stage looks huge, long and narrow. (500 words)

A vocational rehab counselor was questioning me about my cousin Sonja and her capabilities as a VR counselor in the coast office. I told him that Sonja and I go back as far as birth. She had a few things to learn yet, but she was pretty good. He said he wanted to know more. We got into a car and drove to the M City house. There was some snow on the ground. I suggested that he park in the driveway. I say, "Turn right into the driveway." He obstinately turned left into a bank of dirt and snow. He and I agree that that won't do. He turned the car around and parked on the street, facing the "bad corner." I was concerned but saw another car was parked right on the corner so that we were protected from collision. We go into the house. I took him the full length of the house to the far end. I say, "Let's start at the oldest part." It was a freshly remodeled room, empty of furniture, and freshly painted. I told him how this used to be a half-finished garage. I pointed out where the grape vines used to be. It was now a lovely wall with windows. We moved to the next room, the rec room. I pointed to the door. I said, "It used to be somewhere else. I still can't get used to it being there and it startles me when it opens. It too has been freshly remodeled." As he and I had driven up to the house, I had pointed out the rising creek that was in flood stage. I told him that sometimes the creek came right up to the door and sometimes came in and started to flood the house. [BL] (298 words)

I have borrowed a puppy and a kitten from "borrow-a-pet" on a Saturday afternoon. I am playing with them and cooing over them. They are very sweet. The purpose is to play with them to get acquainted and then you can choose the right one. I take them back and put them in their drawers, kittens in the 3rd drawer, puppies in the 4th drawer, except I notice that there are new born kittens in the 4th drawer. I also notice 2 striped cats that blend in with the surroundings and 2 miniature zebras. Co-worker Tyler is in the kitchen room we are in. He's cooking a hamburger steak in the oven. It's time to take it out but he can't find the hot pad. I find the hot pads, and take the steaks out. He then tells me how talented I am with crafts and making things. He says he has a married couple he is counseling, a doctor husband, and 2 boys. They don't communicate with each other. They are people oriented all day and when they get together, they don't get together. I said, "Oh, you want me to teach them a craft so they can get together?" Tyler said, "Right." I say, "Well, which craft shall I teach them?" Tyler looks at me with exasperation. "You're the one doing it, you'll know which one." I look at him, slightly startled, and a little put out. Then I decide to take a number of crafts and they can learn a variety and choose for themselves. Tyler agrees that's a good idea. I get in my van and drive there, a dirt road, muddy, and difficult to stay on. There is a lake on the left and it's important not to slide into the lake (some danger). I look down the road. At the end is a Victorian house and I know it's the one. I drive to the edge of the land. Now I get out of the van. The 2 boys are there. I must walk down wooden decking as the house is on the lake. I am stepping down a rope and wood ladder (like on ships). The woman asks if I need help. I am annoyed. I say, "No. I can do this." Then I comment on how lovely of a house it is, and that it's so nice on the lake. I go in and start to teach the craft. Now the scene is changed. Mabel is upset with me. I am telling her she heard something someone said incorrectly (she's the woman I counseled). She asks people around her what was said. I encourage them to tell what they had heard. I am right. She is wrong, but she's crying. "You should have...,"(maybe told me)! (463 words)

The 2 boys come from their counseling session. They are both naked. I ask them why. They are going to audition for a play. I say, "Huh? Well, O.K." We go into a building down a hall and into a small office only it's like a doctor's examining room. A 3rd boy joins us, also naked. We all get up on the examining table, sort of bed. Chubby is sitting cross-legged in front and to the left. The new boy is to the right and the younger one is rollicking around. He is playfully wrestling with me. He rolls under me and now he's laying and I am sitting crouched over him, his penis under my vagina. I am aware that it's not proper for boys to be naked and yet only partly mind it. I am talking to chubby and looking at him and the boy under me is innocently or absent-mindedly pretending that he is a man and pushing up gently, a child's play version of coitus. I am aware of it. Part of me ignores it. Part of me is a little shocked and part of me is playing too. I say to chubby, "Let me tell you something about auditions. I've done them O.K.? I'm an actress." I'm very serious and chubby listens attentively. "It's better to go with your clothes on. They'll think you're weird if you go naked and only see your nakedness, not your talent. If you go clothed, they'll see your talent and then if they need a naked boy for the play, they'll ask you to take your clothes off and then that's O.K." The boys agree that I'm right, and we are all impressed with the fact that I made logical sense instead of being just prudish or grown up, up-tight about it. I say, "Are you going to audition first and then the counseling session, or vice versa?" They say they want to audition first. They all leave. I feel very sleepy and tired. I lay down and start to drift off to sleep, glad for a few minutes to nap. I try to turn off the lights. I hit the light switch. Nothing happens, and I see another one, but nothing happens. Then around the corner are 3 more. I try them. One works, temporarily. I look at the switches closer. There are lots of gradations. It's a very sensitive and tricky switch, with plastic joints in it. I get frustrated and yell, "To hell with it!" I go to sleep. Then the boys come back and I counsel them. (432 words)

I had another dream but had trouble waking up. I remembered thinking, "Forget it, I don't want to remember this one." I repeated that and then realized that it must be important. I sat up to write it down and it was gone. A "to hell with it" kind of feeling-tone, like with the light switch. The name Roger and a feeling about movement, avalanches. (65 words)

I was going to exchange some old metal things I had, take them to the used metal things store (cradles, adult size, lots of things, a whole attic full). I was going to trade them in for new things but was a little peeved at myself for my ridiculousness because all you can trade in used metal things for in a used metal store is different used metal things. Then my acting class and I were in my house. Ethan was talking to us over the phone. He said that he was sorry he couldn't be there to teach the class today, but we should all go to the library to get articles from 1950's magazines. It would teach us a good acting lesson. I was pleased. I'd done this before and it was fun to look back at that era. I went. We all came back to my house. I had a bunch of magazines, Good Housekeeping, etc. Then they were record albums. I put one on; the Gee-Gee Brothers. Ethan then came into the house. I was wearing a robe that kept slipping open. I kept trying to re-tie the sash and I held it tightly around me. Ethan watched dispassionately. He again apologized for being busy and unable to be there for class. I said, "Oh, it's fine because I liked the assignment. In fact I've done it once before, a sociological project. I took sociology before psychology." Then he said, "And what did you learn?" I pulled my robe tighter around me and noticed with annoyance I kept doing that. I went to go change the long playing 50's record for another. When I came back, Ethan was sweating and his shirt was wet with perspiration. He had it half off. I sat on the couch. Other students were wandering around. Ethan half laid on the arm of the couch, watching me intently. Like a teacher, with some slight care in his face, he had a message to impart and he wanted to be gentle (for him). I said, "About my acting..." He said, "Next term, I want you to work on characters unlike yourself, reach out, expand, use bigger gestures." I said, "You know, in my acting final, you saw that, yes? Well, I kept laughing. You broke me up, I broke me up, my partner broke me up." He frowned. I said, "I know, you see, I'm good at comedy. I've always done little skits that I write and then act in." I was sort of bragging, hoping he'd notice my creativity. He was dead pan. I went on, "And so I act me. I have good comedic timing. Now I need to learn to really act." He nodded. He suggested I practice saying a sentence that ends in all right...all right (someone's name), to get the inflections all right. Then he looked up. Someone was coming in the door. "Oh," he said pulling his shirt back on (it was his wife). "I had better straighten up here." It was a joke. Then 2 delivery boys came to the door. The first one handed me a package, books I had ordered. The second one ran around him and shoved his package into my hands ahead of #1 boy. #1 boy was amazed, so I took the first package that was put in my hands. It was my new checks from the bank. #1 boy left, upset. I looked at him wondering if he expected a tip. He just grimaced and left. I opened the checks. I saw my picture on the check, like my master's degree student days, with long frizzy hair. I was surprised, they had updated the picture. Then as I looked, each picture on each check was different. They looked awful. In one, I was playfully kissing Cory. A woman stood outside, looking in the window. She said something. I didn't hear her and said, "Huh?" She repeated. "Ya, I saw them too, they are pretty funny looking." (667 words)

I have come home from a play or a costume party to a small apartment. I am expecting someone, a male, I think Desmond. I have a Little Bo Peep costume and hat on (like I wore for Halloween), only it's blue. I have lots of blue eyeshadow on my eyes. I go into the bedroom to a bathroom. I look in the mirror and like what I see. I decide to stay in costume for when Desmond comes over. It's later in the evening and I've been in the costume for many hours. My makeup feels itchy, so I go to bathroom number 2. I look in the mirror. I have blue make up all over my face and white highliner. I see some of the makeup is coming off. I decide to wash my face before Desmond comes. I will keep the dress and the blue feather earrings on though. I start to wash my face. My wheelchair is the toilet. It's messy. I think I should clean if off (shit). It's behind me as I stand at the sink. Every time I bend over to the sink, my dress brushes on the messy part. I get annoyed. The light bulbs are getting dim. I turn and pull a chain on one fixture. A small bulb barely lights up the place. I turn to the double sink and turn on the water, and scrub my face with soap and water. Most of the blue is gone and some of the red is smeared. I feel like I'm in a hurry to look pretty. The light bulb goes out. I see the sinks have overflowed onto the floor. I'm standing barefoot on soggy carpet with water to mid-calf. I pull the plug and all the water goes away. I look in the mirror again and pull many clips from my long hair which kept my hair up under my fancy hat. Now, it's nearly totally dark. I go from one light fixture to another, pulling their chains but all the bulbs are blown. I think, "I could go get new lightbulbs." They are in the closet but I can't seem to find the closet. I feel closed in by the dark. I grab my hat, put it back on, leave the room, remember my earrings, and decide not to go back to get them. I go to the bedroom (unused), and look in the mirror, then into bathroom #1. There are some Xmas cards taped to the door. (419 words)

I go diving in the deep river. It's 300 ft. Someone else and I must wear diving helmets and suits because it is so deep. Then, a huge shark attacks. There is blood swirling in the water. One of us is hurt. I'm not sure if I ran and the other is hurt or if it was me. Now, I'm on land. I'm leaving. I'm making gifts for people. I have a cake. I wrap it in cellophane. I then see a sack of candy bits and lollipops in bags in my desk drawer. I say, "Oh, too bad the cake is wrapped." I feel a little badly because the gift isn't much. Also, I don't want to just throw things away. Someone says, "You can unwrap it." They lift the cellophane. I put 4 different kinds of candy on the 4 sections of the cake. There is a second shark scene. Then, I'm auditioning or acting. Then, I'm in the C. department meeting. I watch. We are trying a new way. The women are being patronized and told to be quiet. It doesn't matter. I feel the need to speak. I ask Dylan permission in an adult way. "I have something to say. It might hurt some and might help me." He says, "Go ahead." Dickie glares at me. I say, "Part of me likes what's happening. Small groups are getting to know each other better, and are opening up and talking more honestly with each other (I vaguely remember that this is sort of what I had complained about earlier), however, there is still sexism here in the large group. Women are being told they don't matter." The group had nodded agreement during the 1st part, but Dickie is upset with me for the second part. I feel sad because I'm also making my farewells. I'm leaving them (to act, I think). I'm good for them and they won't listen. I go to pack (I'm in my wheelchair at the end). (333 words)

The family was going to move. It was a sort of a "Father knows best" family. A woman, older (a Lady XXX type, a sad woman I knew in XXX who was lonely and threatened suicide), came by and threatened suicide. Some of my family decided to stay to help her. Then, I was on the road, driving. I looked up to see part of my family in a truck, semi-crashed across the road, but everyone was O.K. I went on down the road and saw Lady XXX's beat up old van/housetrailer crashed into a bank. She was O.K. She was a bit sheepish and stubborn. I thought that she had tried to die. I was annoyed at her because it was causing trouble for my family. I looked up, and across the street was a huge home-made camper, a complete house for a large family on wheels including a back porch. I was laying down in the back of Lady XXX's van with Lady XXX comforting her. I started to go to my family but Lady XXX holds on to me. She didn't want me to leave her. I looked out the window again and saw my teen-age "brothers and sisters" out for a walk to stretch their legs. Some younger ones opened the van and crawled in. I decided to join my family. I got out, against Lady XXX's protests. I was driven across the street by a brother, a younger brother. I was surprised he knew how to drive. He asked which entrance I wanted to use to get into the camper. He says, "It doesn't matter which." The back entrance had 4 steps. The front entrance had a huge flight of stairs first going up and then down, with a landing or two here and there. I said indignantly, "It does too matter. I'm not walking all those steps." I went to the back and got in. Now it was just a big, crowded van. My "brother" was talking as he was driving and not paying attention. He let some of the wheels go over the edge of a cliff that went straight down to the sea. He looked at my "dad" and was horrified. My father waited to see if he would wake up. I was horrified because we were all going to crash to our death. The van slid slowly over the edge and stopped. I knew if anyone moved, it would then continue sliding to the sea and then, death. I decided to save myself. I decided I'd crawl over bodies of my family if necessary but I'd save myself. I started to carefully crawl up and out. A 1 year old baby was caught upside down near me. I grasped the edge of the cliff. Then, I just couldn't leave her, so I reached down and grabbed the baby and threw her up to safety. I felt scared and sad. I scrambled up to the road edge and started grabbing any babies or people around, to assist them. The van tumbled half-way down the cliff. People and things were scattered all over. I saw "dad" half-way down and I yelled, "Dad, dad, dad!" I say, "Here, reach up, I can pull you up." He looked at me sadly. I felt fear that he was too big and would pull me back over. I was also afraid he wouldn't try to reach up to me. I got a blanket and leaned it over the edge to reach him. Other people reached out to me (one of them, Oriental). I pulled them up to safety as my father refused to be helped. I felt sad. All the rest that could be saved were. My father decided to try. I then saw that part of one leg was missing. He crawled up to the edge and someone else and I helped him over the edge. We were near the edge. I was crouched near him, comforting him. I said, "Are you O.K.?" He said he thought one leg was broken and the other one gone partly. A young man, a violinist, came over. He was the anesthesiologist. He started to play. My father got quite upset and told him to go away. He was distressed and tried to explain how his music would help take away the pain. A second violinist was called in, a young woman with a very ornate violin. I looked up at her and explained that dad wouldn't listen. I defended his position. I said, "Look, how would you like it if you had to listen to violins all day at work (my father's a music teacher), and then come home to your family and hear violins (I played for 5 years and my mother played too), you'd be sick of it too." I used a second analogy but I don't remember it. (812 words)

My brother Dwight, Jake, my mother and I are in a car in a parking lot. Dwight is telling me about the gold lame dress he wore at a party. I am giggling at how funny he describes how he got a kit, a spray can of gold lame. You put a bikini-like top on, spray the paint, and put holly on. He pulls out a brochure and shows me an advertisement. He belongs to a club that gives parties, but you have to take a class if you go to a party. He points to a lovely lady in the brochure and winks at me. He then starts to park the pickup in his regular parking spot. He then changes his mind and tries to park somewhere else. The entire parking lot is empty except for one black sports car. Dwight tries to park his pickup over that car. The car is so low to the ground, and the pickup is so high, that he almost makes it. He then backs up. My mother is at the wheel now, and backing up real fast. I yell, "What are you doing?" We feel like we're out of control and now backing out into the street. She ignores me and purposefully and gaily keeps going. We're now going forward. I see big freeway signs. We're in a big city. She's going to park us (a VW bus now) near an apartment building.

A young boy is riding a horse. He's doing trick stunts to show off. He's now off the horse, trying to go into a building on campus with no authorization. A security guard stops him. I walk up behind him. I'm on my way to teach a class. I vouch for him though I don't know him. He looks at me, surprised. I walk down the hall. I see a group of people. They are the class. The boy ducks into a room just before my classroom. I open the door and go in. I say, "I know who you are, so don't get into trouble, or I'll get into trouble." He says surprised, "How can you know who I am?" I think, "You're bluffing." I say, "No, you are John Travolta. I knew it when you were riding the horse. You stuck your foot out, and it was arrogant. Only boys from New York do it in that style, and only 4 of them like you did, so you have to be John Travolta." Then I say, "Don't worry, I won't tell." He looks at me like he likes me. I beat a hasty retreat. I look at my watch and say, "Oh, I'm 6 or 7 minutes late for my class." I go next door where my class is waiting. It's like a library or a book store, so I figure I'm teaching something about writing. Later, I'm lying in a bed in my classroom. The boy is sitting on the edge of the bed beside me. We are talking. At one point, he hugs me and I can feel the largeness of his shoulders/body that denotes a grown man. I think, "Oh, goodness, he really is John Travolta." I then realize the near sexual aspects of the position and firmly tell the little boy to stop playing now. He wants to continue but I tell him, "No." He sits on the edge of the bed and we talk. There is some flirtation (sometimes there is a sense of my brother Dwight in him). (346 words)

My mother, who has been driving, gets out of the pickup. My brother Dwight goes in. I start to pick up some things they left to carry them into the apartment complex. A pair of black gloves (my mother's), Xmas presents, and some pretty woven yarn cloth. I have my arms full as I start to walk across the parking lot. I drop some things, books, cards, and pictures fall to the ground. I curse and try to pick them up without dropping everything else, but no luck. Everything falls all over the asphalt. A hip black man, like scat man on T.V., jives up to me. He's going to help pick things up. As he starts to do so, he notices a huge bow and arrow set on top of the pickup. It's like a crossbow or a speargun and it's very powerful. He loads a red arrow into the thing and aims off into the distance. I say, "Hey man, don't do that at full force, you'll spend days looking for the arrow." He shoots it but it just goes a short distance over the bushes. He laughs at me and goes to get the arrow. I find some boxes to put the stuff in. A crowd is starting to develop. They look like they are going to steal all my goodies. I then have a high powered rifle. I hold it at them. I call for my brother. He comes over to carry the goodies in. A very inquisitive older woman comes over. I say disdainfully, "See, just woven cloth mostly, nothing of great value." I swagger around feeling pretty show-offy with my gun. A guy wearing glasses, but good-looking, just looks at me, slightly disapproving. I show off my prowess with the rifle. Dwight gets all the goodies in. I then notice a pile of wrapped Xmas presents under a tree near the pickup in the parking lot. One says, "To dad, from Dwight." I think, "Huh, that's silly. They'll get stolen." I then decide not to worry because they're wrapped. I figure the family was getting too crowded in the apartment with all those gifts and I go on in. (365 words)

I'm walking up some long cement stairs to get to school, carrying lots of things. Gordon (a counselor) walks with me. He jokes about how old he is now and how he needs to walk slowly. He hugs me in a fatherly way. I slip and fall back down some stairs. He slips too. We lay on the stairs laughing and I think, "How sweet of him to go to all the trouble to make me feel O.K." We get up and start gathering up the scattered things we were carrying. A woman helps us carry the Xmas gifts, scotch tape, calligraphy pens and ink. Gordon goes on ahead. I get to the top of a glassed-in bleacher and a wonderful show is performing, grand costumes and musical comedy stuff. I'm aware that I'm wearing a sexy playboy bunny suit and a red sexy coat. I then feel someone nestling up behind me. Now we're sitting on the same chair. I look. It is Ethan. He puts a Xmas gift from him to me in my pile of things. As we watch the performances, he makes director's remarks. At one point, there are 2 complete productions going on at once. He says he sees no point to that unless one is entertainment for the other. I comment that perhaps it's because of the placement of the windows at angles. Some of the crowd sees one, some see the other. He concedes that I may be right. I keep looking at my watch. I don't want to be late for my class I am teaching. Then, there is yet a 3rd performance way down on the football field. Huge people are dressed in fancy fur costumes. Some ice skate and some comedy relief happens. Then I say, "I must go." Before I can leave, Ethan's class comes to him. He stands up in front of me and them. I am aware (I'm standing), and that my playboy bunny suit is larger and just hangs on me. It's not so sexy now. I'm embarrassed and try to cover it up. A girl in class asks if the cleaning of a wig can be done for free. She says a friend of hers has 2 wigs that are soiled and she brings out a letter to read, written by the girl. She is in tears because she realizes that she shouldn't read this private letter in front of the class. I start to leave (after Ethan lectures about acting technique, looking at me as he talks). I get my red coat on and start to pick up my packages. Ethan comes over. He says, "Is anything wrong?" I say, "No, it's just that my suit looks really funny right now and I'm embarrassed." He says, "I noticed but it's O.K., you're fine." We smile. I pick up his Xmas present to me and open it. It is body paints. He laughs and opens them and starts to paint my face and he starts with the yellow and white. We're somehow in a moving car, but neither of us are driving, or maybe Ethan is and doesn't have to look at the road often. He gets some of the paint in my mouth. It tastes funny. He says, "Don't worry, it's not toxic." I spit it out in a hanky anyway. We laugh. I have become his mistress, as he is married. (568 words)

I had some company and they left. I was tired and wanted to sleep. I could sleep sitting up in the van, passenger side, or sleep on the bench seat in the back. Both ways I'd be uncomfortable and cold, so I went to Thea's house and slept in a bed there. They weren't home. I woke up the next day and was getting ready to leave. I came out of the bedroom and found Thea and someone else there. She lectured me about taking advantage of her, using her house without permission, and she asked me if I had used anything else. I was quite annoyed with her. I wanted to leave. It didn't seem polite to leave in the middle of her lecture. She was angry. So was I. I felt guilty and caught but I also felt justified and annoyed. I wished I had chosen to sleep in my cold van. Then, I just decided to leave. I said, "Bye." She was miffed. I was then in a library, borrowing books. The female that was with Thea was also borrowing books. She was jealous of something. I talked to my brother Dwight. [BL] (195 words)

I am being challenged, by myself really. Someone has made a comment that they can do something, play crosses and foxes and I wonder if I can do it as well or better. I am encouraged by cousin Terence/Dwight to try. I have a self-defeating negative outlook. "No, I can't do that," but my interest is piqued, so I go upstairs to try. I see a board on the wall. A man gives me a chalk and explains the rules. I can't make a mark where something is crossed and he points out 2 places. Some people come by and irrelevantly chat with me. I yak back. I am partly sure I can do this and partly sure I can't. They (the crowd) are annoying as they distract me. I close them out of my mind and the timing starts. I look at the marking on the board for what seems a long time (see drawing in dream book). The crowd gets tense because I'm wasting valuable time but I know that I'm looking at the whole picture to do better. Then as I've seen all I need, I say, "Aha!," and start making X's and O's. The crowd goes, "Ooh!," because every move is right. There is excitement and tenseness. Near the bottom, there are squiggly lines where I'm not supposed to mark but I see 2 places that were difficult and no one else noticed and mark. This time I draw an outline of a rabbit for my X. Times up. I get 7. That ties me with my cousin Terence/Dwight. He's good. The man who is really good says, "Hum, she's got more white light than me even," and is impressed. I am aware that I'm talking despairingly of my talents. I am an observer and I don't like her eyes. They are too large and cow-like. I say to her/me, "Don't talk negatively and put yourself down. You're good," (It was like a challenge in a pool game). Counseling or working with people had something to do with it. (343 words)

I was in prison. My "man" and I were cell mates. My "husband" was also in prison. I think we were there because of what he did. I had done a needlepoint thing that was thick and looked like sheepskin. We were trying to figure out how to block it. A man (my husband) said, "Why not wrap it around your body and go take a steam bath." I looked at him and said, "What a good idea." I wrapped it around me and wrapped a towel around it to cover it. I walked down the hall to the public bathroom. At first, I couldn't find the steam bath, just the toilet stalls. Then I saw 2. A large woman got to it first. I was agitated because I didn't want to get caught. I saw a sign-up sheet, so I signed my name, "Barb Sanders." The pencil was on a string and almost didn't reach and the writing was crooked, slanted uphill. Just as I finished writing my name, the woman got out of that steam bath and I got in. Then I got scared. It was metal with a shower-like nozzle near my face. I was afraid I'd hurt myself and the steam would be too hot and burn me, so I carefully read the instructions. I was just about to turn it on when the door opened and a woman came in with 2 men (plain-clothed cops). I felt like I'd been caught. I had been wondering how to get back to my cell because the towel would be wet too but I had to keep the sheepskin covered. They started to question me. One said, "Well, Gretchen" and I got indignant. "I'm not Gretchen." I played out my limp and sat down, explaining I had R.A. I knew I was faking it. It worked, and they left. I then went back to my room/cell. It was damp from the steam bath. It was time to escape/leave. I did so. Then, I was rich, dressed in a suit and high heels, golden earrings with jewels on my ankles. I was looking down busy city streets. I go to a store where Thea and Jared work. I bought a pin the shape of a bird or turtle that I knew Jared loved. I decided not to give anything to Thea. I then walked on down the street to another shop where Jared was working. I gave him the pin. He was overcome by my kindness. He hugged me a lot. I felt his pot belly and his flaccid penis. I started to feel like it was time to move on. I walked, and then I noticed I was in a bad neighborhood. I felt a little nervous. I was walking toward a busy street where I could get a bus or a taxi. A man walked up to me and started to harass me. He was going to rape me. I got angry. At first, I warned him to leave me alone. He grabbed me and in one swift and powerful kick to his groin, I got him. He fell to the ground, groaning. I kept on walking. I walked past a newsstand. A couple of leather jacket types started to verbally harass me. I told them to watch out, because I'd protected myself before and I'd do it again. A 3rd man said, "Ya, she's right. Leave her alone." I walked on. I went into a cafe to call a taxi. I think I was crying. A taxi driver there said "Hey, where do you want to go?" I said, "Are you a taxi driver?" He said, "Ya." I said, "Let's go." I feel rescued. (618 words)

I'm in a plane. We go to Russia. We sneak in through a fireplace and try to mingle with the Russians. There is a factory. We visit it. Then we have to leave before we get caught. As we go back to the fireplace, I stop at a bathroom. Some women are upset with me because I've been there, and they've had to go hungry. They are going to turn me in. I talk with them. They are sullen and resentful but don't turn me in. I respect their feelings. I sneak back through the fireplace to the airplane. I gather up powdered eggs, milk, etc. to take back to the women. It's only fair. We sneak back into Russia. Sometimes we are invisible because the solders or cops are near by. We sneak into the house. The women are in the kitchen, doing dishes. We bring the food to them. We are all pleased with each other. Then it is time to go. We sneak back to the plane but are seen. Now we scramble and get into the air. Planes are after us. It is important to get out of Russian territory so in case we get hit, we won't land on Russian grounds. We duck and fly low because their jets can't. It's foggy and cloudy and I call out the names of the high mountains we are zigzagging through. There is much tension. "Big Mama" mountain is on the left, "Bear" mountain, the Rockies. Then we go up behind the Russian jet, and strafe it with machine gun bullets. The jet goes down. We're over water now. Just before it hits, I yell, "Nuke bomb!" We scramble into our yellow, anti-radiation suits. They are like giant sleeper suits. We put on masks that protect our faces and we breath filtered air. We look back at the huge cloud rising from where the jet crashed. We had gone fast to get out of the shock wave area. The cloud was even bigger and more deadly than a mushroom cloud. Then I see many more of them. "What's going on?" I ask. "Why are there more?" (358 words)

I wake up feeling a lot of anger. I then drift back to sleep. I was at a family reunion picnic thing. I set up the lunch and entertainment. They were not too thrilled with my ho-hum hamburger gravy and potatoes and openly snickered at my skits. I took a cat in my arms and the cat and I walked up close to each of my relatives (black and white adult cat). They were all sitting in a semi-circle. I held the cat up to the face of each one. The cat bit cousin Willie real hard. I told the cat not to bite anymore. He just looked at me. My Grandpa Lloyd and Grandma Mildred were having an "argument," much like my parents. Grandpa took a big sweet dessert and ate it. I ate a spoonful of sweet chocolate, wondering why I did it because it wasn't good for me. Grandma nagged at him, ever so sweetly. "Now Lloyd, look at that. You know better than to...etc." Lloyd just glared at her and ate more. They were like children deliberately getting on each other's nerves. Ginny, my Aunt Millie, Bonnie and I got into a car to go to a fair for the disabled. I was angry because I realized that I only had a bicycle with flat tires to assist me when I got to the fair and I was going to get tired and achy walking around. We had trouble getting there. When we got there, a car was backing out into traffic. One wheel got caught on the curb and the whole car turned over. A woman driver was in it. I kept wondering how she managed to flip the car and if she was all right. Another car, trying to get into the parking lot, just pushed her around. She finally got out. I then started making a list of all the supposed things being done for the disabled and discovering it wasn't helping the disabled. It was helping the establishment feel good about helping the disabled. I wrote these down so I could expose this. I saw Marv C with a bandage on his thumb. We hugged. He said, "It was so kind of you to like my things." His things were beautifully calligraphied posters in blue ink. I then picked it up and looked closely. I said, "It is pretty and quite nice, but did the disabled make them? How are they helping the disabled?" I put him on my list. I also put the Iron Duchess on my list. (427 words)

I am in an unhappy home. I am at school. My "brother" and I have big stop watches. We discover that if we push the button right, it will remove us to a parallel universe that is in some ways slightly different from the one we are in. I am not happy in my present universe. People are cool. My brother and I live with step-parents that don't care about us. We come home from school. My watch is broken or was broken by kids at school. My "step-mother" is very uncaring. It's late at night. We decide to go to the other universe. My brother has already tried it and says that it is better than where we are. I follow him to his bedroom. I have a "younger sister" with me. We sneak in being very quiet so we don't wake up "younger brother" or "step-mother." My brother lies on the bed. I stand up on the bed, my feet under his back. I keep almost losing my balance. The "younger sister" (Paulina), stands on the side of him, holding very hard. We set the dials. At first, nothing happens. Then I get worried something will go wrong. Then a part of the watch shines red and the scene changes and then the scene is the same. A woman comes in. It's my "step-mother." At first, it is Claire K (a client) and then my Aunt Naomi. She offers me soda and cookies. At first I won't eat them because they have sugar and then I do. She is talking to me, making comments that give me information about the situation on this planet or universe. I carefully don't answer questions. She says she is going away. She tells me there is a package on the porch for me. She is friendly and nice. She talks about men. We agree that they are messy. I say, "Look at the bottom of that river." I see a river with garbage and debris on the bottom. "I sure didn't put that there. You didn't. Men did." Now I'm on a boat. We are about to cross the harbor. The man at the helm says, "They've dug out the harbor here and as such now two way traffic can now get through." He says, "You'll find it much changed." I look and realize that it's a lot of traffic like New York City harbor. I see wooden boats that look like whales on the bank. He says, "Here we go," and suddenly the boat flies up over some apartment buildings and over the watery expanse between the buildings. I expect the boat to drop down, fly up and drop down again, but we fly smoothly. My younger sister holds my hand. (460 words)

A nightmare. Entities or souls or creatures from other planets are coming to meld with humans and take our spirits away. I am very frightened. The children are the first to go and then the adults. It's a terrible feeling of the fear of losing myself as through death or absorption into another. They come, 3 of them. The one coming for me is a big man in a chicken hawk suit with red and blue fluffy feathers. He talks like an English pirate (irate)? We meld and a transparent form of my body is tucked under his wing and off we fly. What a ride. I can feel my stomach lurch as we go zipping up to the cosmos and down again. It's like a jet plane. We get to their planet. Then a man gets shot and falls. I'm surprised because I thought, "1.) No one dies here, and 2.) ugly, mean people don't exist here." They take the body of a 2 yr old baby and this shot man's soul goes into the baby. His face, is only softened and rounded like a baby. I'm appalled because they had told me we were just being borrowed. Now I know we were being lied to. I feel awful. I tell Nate to run. "I'm sorry I got you into this mess." (223 words)

I'm cooking hamburgers at my mother's house. I come in with 4 little ones. She sneers and says that there should be more. I feel hurt and angry and then I go out. I look and there are lots more but they've fallen on the floor, the messy greasy floor. I'm crying as I pick them up because I know if she sees, I'm in trouble. I have a hard time picking them up. Finally I get them into the house, and she comes up to me and growls, "Hurry up. They're in there, hungry, tired and fighting," (My father and the rest of the family). I say, "I have to cook the potatoes first," and she says, "No! Do something about the hamburgers first. Feed them the hamburgers and then come cook the potatoes." She walks out. I'm crying and angry and I get stubborn. I look for the potato peeler in the sink of dirty dish water. All I keep coming up with are sharp knives. I'm careful with them. I peel the potatoes and get them into a pan and take them to the stove, move another pot off the burner to make room for the potatoes and see that a cooked steak is there. There are lots of them, 3. She comes back in. I say, "Look! You had a good dinner already cooked and you had me out there working and crying and you weren't even going to let me have a good dinner." She yells at me about finding some other place to live. I say, "Yes, sure, I'll get out." She storms out. My father says to me (he's standing behind me), "7-6-5-4 yeah, you could be packed and out by 5." I know he means a.m. and I don't get up early, and I get furious at him and I turn and yell, "You little short runt!" Dwight is standing nearby. My father is about 4 feet tall. I yell, "You always take her side!" I am angry and hurt. (338 words)

I am on an airplane. The purpose of the ride is to entertain the kids. I have a job as a "Granny"; that's where you dress up as an old woman and sit on a chair at the back of the stairs. The kids sit at bottom of stairs and talk to you. You entertain them. Then I have the makeup all over my face to look old and peek in to see someone else doing it. The kids are staring at me. I laugh and say, "I guess I look funny with all this old lady makeup on." Then it is a bus and the driver (a fat ugly woman), gets out at a rest stop. Now I'm fighting 3 men that are getting on the bus. I point to one, a young good-looking man, and call him Satan. They are evil and I must protect myself by killing them. [BL] (151 words)

I was in bed at home. Desmond had come to visit me. He asked me to go out. I said, "No, I'm too tired." We talked. He left. Then Nate called and asked if I was up. I said, "Yes." Then I heard Nate come into house downstairs. He was drunk. He was yelling at my parents, Grandma Agnes, and my aunts and uncles. He was angry at me because I said I would go out with him and now my parents had told him that I was in bed asleep. He demanded to know who that fellow was that just left. I was embarrassed because my family didn't know about Nate and I was angry at him for creating the scene. I got up and went downstairs in my red plaid, flannel nightgown. I just looked at him in anger. I asked him to step outside. I told him, "This is the last straw." He was all dressed up in a suit and tie. He stepped to side of the house to pee. I was embarrassed because my relatives might see. I read him the riot act. I told him never again to do that in front of my conservative relatives. He then left, angry. I then had a class. They were there to learn how to enjoy the wilderness as I had learned to do. I told them to close their eyes and think of their favorite food. Then I told them to think of all the ways they could cook it, sauteed, boiled, etc. Then they needed to cut it into little squares and carry it in a backpack. Then they were to pair up. One put on a blindfold, the other lead and then later they switched. I then got a chalk. At first, I start to ask for one, and then I looked for it myself. I draw dotted lines with arrows around leading up to hopscotch games on the playground (school). The starting place was an old tree. As I was making my marks, I came up to a class counter with china in it. I see a teapot that looked like it went with an old tea cup I own. I asked this guy for it. I said, "It's mine." He gave it to me. I was now carefully stepping amongst the china. I asked the guy for a hand so I wouldn't fall and break things. He helped me. I started to feel guilty because I realized it was not my teapot and I'd just stolen it. Someone was going to be sad. (431 words)

Then Shannon calls. I say, "Hey! I'm awake," and she says, "Ya, I know why, because of our main class." I say, "Ya, that too of course, but you'll never guess what happened.

I am a reporter. I am interviewing both of the president's wives. There are a lot of reporters there. The older, wiser wife does most of the talking. The young pretty one just smiles a lot. I try to get her to talk. Her name is Trixie Beldon (a name of a book I read as a 13 year old or so). Then the interview is over. The pack of reporters start to go to the next room. Lots of them are saying, "Mr. President, Mr. President." I'm on the edge and plan on sneaking away to a bigger and better story. A man, also a reporter, watches me and follows me. I run and get a taxi. He jumps in too. I am annoyed with him because I'm about to scoop the whole pack and he's blowing it for me. I see that I'm stuck with him, so I tell him, "I have to change my clothes. I'll be interviewing tough mob types." I'm wearing a tailored woman's suit. I tell him to not look and I take off my suit. I ask him to hand me my other clothes out of the briefcase. He does. He peeks. I'm crouched down so no one can see in the windows. Some tough mob types try. Then I'm trying to interview them. I now have to go to the apartment of the leader. This guy and I (now attracted to him), go to the apartment and ring the door bell. A strange looking "outerspace" creature (a pet), comes to the door. It's a living rock on 4 legs or a tiny hippopotamus. The guy pets it. Then I pound it on the head. I figure to pet it, you'd have to be rough so he'd feel it. It hurts him and he pounds me to show me how it feels. Now he's going to teach me how to be gentle and nice, so he pets me nicely on the head. The man and I are falling in love. The man is glad I'm learning to be sensitive. Then he and I are kissing. When I feel the saliva in his mouth, I can read his thoughts. It spooks him. "How did you know that?" (373 words)

I married my brother Jake. We were getting the furniture packed. Some of it was to be put in the "little house," (the house next to my parents'), and some taken to M City. My parents and sister were there to help. We only had a weekend for a honeymoon as on Monday, I had to be back to work on school. Then, we were sitting in the car going over the mountain. Then there was a big truck with our things in it. Someone was going to drive it for us. The driver went away. For some reason, Jake couldn't drive the truck, so I was saying, "Maybe I can do it, hon," and he said, "No, it's too hard for you." Then I said, "See, I can try." I got in and tried to drive it. I couldn't get it to stop. The brakes wouldn't hold, so it would slowly roll. Chuck was around helping move furniture. Then I got the truck to stop and Jake started yelling, "I'm bleeding to death!" I grabbed his hand and ran up the wooded hill. My father and my brother Dwight ran to him to see if it was so. I was thinking, "He's probably exaggerating." He came back and Dwight tried to put a pressure bandage on him. I was holding Jake and soothing him. I said, "Hon, relax. I'll take you to the hospital." "No," he said, "...got to get the bleeding to stop." My brother Dwight fainted. I looked at Jake's wound. I saw lots of orange blood but no continuous flow that indicated an artery or vein was cut. I tried to get him on the back of the motorcycle. Then I yelled, "Get him in the car! I'll be right back!" I felt a coughing seizure coming on and I ran for the house to get a glass of water thinking I'd grab it, get in the car, and drive Jake to hospital. I woke up coughing. Oh, earlier in the dream, I was teasing Chuck because he had clips and pin curls in his hair. He teased back and said, "How else can you have curly hair at work that everyone admires." He said that he was partial to saffron yellow now (somehow meaning that he was in love with Valerie). (386 words)

I'm in the back seat of a car. Terence (my cousin) gets in with me. He wants to neck. He starts kissing me and so forth. I accept it but feel not too good about it. He's my cousin and there are other people in the car. It starts to feel good sexually so I think, "Eh, what the heck." Then he says, "You turn and change position." He had been touching my breast. Now he wants me to touch his penis. I sit up and move away. I think, "No, that's going to far. I don't want to." I start talking to other people in the car (my parents in front, and my brother Dwight next to us). We're driving country roads. My father stops the car by a mailbox to look at a shallow stream. There might be good rock hounding material there. My mother is embarrassed because someone is getting their mail and might wonder why we stopped by their mail box. My father is annoyed with my mother and vice versa. We then drive on. We come to Ka-ne-ta, an Indian Resort. There are lots of people. My father points one out. He calls him a special name. He's a Chief or something. I decide to knit. I open a package, a kit. Part of the knitting has been done. It's a delicate lacy pattern, pink, baby sweater-like. (232 words)

Ginny is helping me fix up/clean up my house. Will S comes in. We like each other. He starts to caress me and we initially agree, non-verbally, to make love. We take off our clothes and lay on the dining room table. At first, I am concerned because he's an older man and I think maybe he won't feel good, but he's strong and sensual and the experience is very enjoyable. It lasts a long time. There are interruptions. Ginny and her two sons come in and talk to me. We stop making love and I tell her to go away now. She looks hurt and wants to stay. I gently ask her to leave for awhile. Her sons are fighting. Will S tells them how to get along. Then a candle is burning near us. My mother appears and says, "Here, I'll move that, it can burn the wood, or your hair." I say firmly, "Here, give me back the candle," and firmly put it back where I want it. She looks hurt and looks around for something to straighten or fix. She leaves. Will S and I continue. I feel embarrassed because it is taking me so long. He understands and doesn't mind. It feels good. [BL] (208 words)

I was in a locker room adjoining the swimming pool. Two girls and myself were getting ready to go in. We got white swimming caps to put on. Mine had a brim like a baby's bonnet. I was having some difficulty stuffing my long hair into it. We were late for our class. We decided to play hookey. The men's class came back into the locker room. There was something about auditioning in a play. Then I put on a beautiful white dress. It was an old-fashioned wedding dress. I thought, "It's beautiful." I looked in mirror. It was a trick mirror. I looked squashed, out of proportion. The lace work on the dress was lovely. I looked at the back of the dress. I saw a beautiful, lacy bustle. It was laying across a stuffed animal's tail. I was sitting on a large, stuffed, duck billed platypus. The yellow cloth bill was in front and the other girl (who had made the bustle and had so informed me when I exclaimed about its existence with, "Well, I know that, I made it"), and I are playing puppets. We laughed. It was time to take the dress off and give it back. I was going to be an actress. (209 words)

I am in Ireland at a school. We are lined up like in a fire drill. There are huge war ships going down the river. They are so big that an inner tube falls off on the back of the river and it is almost as wide as the river. I am exclaiming about how big it is and how can anyone hang on to it! We are supposed to stay indoors but I keep sneaking out. Veronica (a co-worker) asks me to come see a ship her grandmother was on. It is a large tea cup. Basically, I am on my way back to an American trip. I am being kidnapped to India. They talk me into coming into the cabin and resting for awhile. I look out the window and see the land going up and down. After I wake up from my rest, we are at sea. There is unrest (war) in India. I see huge guns. I'm being manipulated by "grandma" to get ready to have lunch with the captain. I know that and I keep stalling for time. I put my lipstick on and it smears; I do it again and it smears. She and her husband wink at me (he knows my game and isn't mad). He takes the lipstick and draws silver, fake symbols on a sign. I am delighted because it looks like a code. It will keep everybody busy trying to figure it out. The grandma then looks at me angrily and asks if I've hidden something. I smile at her and say, "Oh, yes. I did that." She just seethes. I enjoy being obstinate and non-helpful. Then the captain comes in. I make excuses for being late and falsely apologize. He seems to know I'm stalling and is challenged by me. He smiles. (303 words)

I am trying to figure out how to simulate flight in zero gravity to show my class. My father suggests I get some swings and swing up high. When I start to fall back down, I'll feel free flight. I try it. They are surprised I can do it. Then I see something that belongs to Corrine in the financial aid office. Then Curtis of Nighthawks (the harmonica player), is watching me. I go to a small office where I'm locked in by him. I look around the desk. I am aware that I've found some secret things, a file folder with paper. A voice (male) on the telephone asks me some questions and I answer carefully pretending that I'm whomever he thinks he's talking to. I see tape cassettes in the desk drawer and I think, "Talk Southern." He gets suspicious. I stay there all night. Curtis comes to open the door and I have hidden under my clothes some papers that are incriminating. He's suspicious of me but I get away with it. (175 words)

Here is a family. They sell things. They go from town to town, gather up a work crew and pay them to work. We hawk up a crew, tell them to go buy some food and we will reimburse them. The mom tells them an economical way of buying so they get more for their money. Then she tells them to line up at the washing machines and she'll wash their clothes. They do and one of the men notices the washers are broken. A hose or pipe in the back is broken. The older man in the family shakes his head. It can't be fixed. It's the pipe. The father tries to talk him into it. The old man bemoans the use of pipe. He says, "It's made of hydrochloric acid." The family, he says, does a good thing. "We sell animals all over the country. They grow and multiply. Out of 100, comes 500 and a return of 5. That we keep for our own." He mentions the chickens, the sweet chickens, and how many have died from the poison in the pipes that we've sold with them. He is sad. Then the mother goes into a house. It's a scary house. There are halloween things there, spiders etc. She sees a picture on the wall. It's not clear. She asks for it to be clearer. The wall tries again. It's not clear. She tries to see it. Then she asks the older man to made it clearer with his dark room skills. He does. The picture shows on the wall. The woman/me is so frightened that she refuses to look. She covers her face with her hands and screams and screams. She thinks, "It's probably a picture of me dead, dressed like zombie." The room is very frightening (I wake up hearing the screams in my mind. There is a dream before this one that I am semi-aware of...I was so sleepy, that I just let it slip by. Before I went to sleep tonight, I asked for my dreams to tell me why I choose to stop enjoyment of an orgasm. After the lst dream of night, I asked for message to be clearer). (368 words)

A group of people go moving into an old store front in a city. I see several women that I had gone to the lst and 2nd grade with. I've come back to live. Another woman, my brother and I are looking over the apartment. There are lots and lots of rooms, old fashioned furniture. There are lots of pianos, pretty little ones, antiques, huge mirrors, and a leather flat bag. I start to look in it and think, "I don't want to see what's in here." I look anyway. A baby or a cat is in there. It looks at me and glares. I cover it back up. Then I'm at a dance with lots of guys. Then I'm back at the apartment, looking for a room for my bedroom. I knock on a door and say, "I'm coming in." A guy is in there. He's upset. It's his room. I apologize. I've walked into someone else's apartment. This woman and I keep going to other rooms. I'm holding the cat now. I'm in an evening dress. The woman and I find a room. There are gays in there. She lies down. The cat is upset and runs away. I lie down beside her. Her husband, latin or black, holding their baby, stumbles in drunk and lays down on the other side of her. She is annoyed with him. I have a feeling we're going to make love and I feel scared. My brother and my father are wandering around. (251 words)

I have to "babysit" or assist a quack. He's withdrawn and somewhat helpless. I take him home with me, the old duplex Howard and I lived in when I was pregnant with Dovre. The only place to sleep is on a roll-away bed in the living room. I lay down beside him. I have my back turned to him. I'm aware of my body, some what tense. Behind he's paralyzed, he can't feel me. He wants to hear music. He asks me to put on a record. I get up and look on the old card table. There are albums all over it. He gets up (walks stiff and holds hands stiff), and points to an album and says, "Oh, go ahead and play it, and get it over with. Then I can hear what I like." I look at it, Old English Madrigals. I say, "Now, I'm tired of it," so I find the jacket to put it away. "What do you want to hear? It's O.K. I'll play it." I'm called to the phone. My sister Lydia asks what I'm doing at the old place. I say "Oh, it's O.K., I'm just here for a day or two, then back to my new house." "Oh, I'm glad, " she says. Then Bill E. is outside the window. I follow him. Now he's a woman, going dancing. He's wearing a bright yellow dress. In order to dance, since he's/she's paralyzed, there are two suction cups like tassels on her breasts that are attached to a glass sheet. She ungulates around being supported by those cups. It stretches the breasts and I think, "Ugh. That must hurt. But at least she's getting out and having fun." I am pleased as she's not being withdrawn as much now. (297 words)

I'm listening to a tape cassette and ten recordings on it. I get the tape messed up and I'm trying to rewind it back on. I am concerned because it's important. Several women are laughing an sneering at me, like I'm stalling and trying to destroy the tape. A Rolls Royce comes and stops by me. A lot of people get out. The star (like Mickey Rooney), gets out. He comes to me and we kiss. His show comes through town every so often and he sees me then and then leaves. His entourage sneer at me. We go for a walk. We kiss. Then he says, "Sorry babe, time to leave now," he goes away, and then he comes back for the next visit. That is our relationship. He asks me how I've been. He asks me if I have practiced and if I'm walking better. I say, "Sure." Then he starts to say goodbye and leaves and then he turns and comes back. He says, "No, I'm staying. We'll stay together. You'll practice and I'll make sure." I'm pleased and not pleased all at the same time. I get what I asked for and now not sure that's what I want. [BL] (203 words)

I am a teacher at a grade school. A man teacher follows me around teasing me to be in a puppet show (hand held puppets that are so heavy you wear part of it). He's funny and I keep laughing. He won't let me alone, so I'm laughing and saying no and telling him to go away. Then I reluctantly agree to do it. I play a lady horse. The wire and cardboard on my arm is very heavy. I sashay around and sing and shinny. I'm very funny. The guy is aggressive, sharp-witted and persistent. He likes me but it's overwhelming. (102 words)

My good-looking "husband" and I are divorced. He's directing a play. I am a designer or script writer. I wear my hair long, with jeans, informal, and I go backstage. He is flabbergasted at me and watches nervously. His second wife is there (as I hopped up on stage, I have to be careful not to step on placemats and napkins. The stage shakes like an earthquake and made walking difficult). I strike up a conversation and lead her into a discussion about her first wife, i.e. me. I don't tell her who I am. He can't stand seeing us together talking, so he comes back to "work on the set" near us. He's painting shades of pink on the set. The stuff he's standing on (cardboard), starts to break and fall. He runs in place as it avalanches under his feet and into the water. Someone asks him how much is lost. He can't tell because it's underwater. I then have to leave, because I have a debt to pay and must go to the bank. I come back, dressed in a nice suit with my hair up. Now I can be identified as "Jean," his first wife. My husband and his second wife are on stage and I walk up to them (only my conscious perspective is with the second wife now). She/I is apprehensive about the classiness of the 1st wife. The "husband" then wants to be with the 1st wife. He follows her. They still love each other. (252 words)

I am in a house. It's near the edge of a canyon. I see two volcanoes blow up. I see huge ash plumes. I see some water splashing up over the edge of the canyon and I'm aware that the house and I are in changes. I tell Howard, "We have to get out." He's calm and ridicules me for getting excited over nothing. I see the water getting closer and grab the three girls and run for it. He is following me and telling me what a fool I am. I look back and I see an older man, a para, out of his chair, sitting on the floor. Water is raging and swirling around him. A black carpet, carried by the water, covers him. He's caught. I run to a telephone booth. Someone is in it. I see another. I get to it. It's not a regular one; it's a narrow, funny looking phone. I don't know how to operate it. I search in my coat pocket for a dime. Howard offers a quarter. I am relieved. I have my own dime, so I don't have to accept his money. I try to use the phone, but the buttons are more like my radio.

Snatches of the other dream. Sandy C, hypnosis. Someone put a yellow tattoo color on my ear. I was angry that they would use me so badly without my permission.

I am with a group of people. I see the ocean. I am near a jungle. I am a leader, like Katherine Hepburn. My daughter (young teen) is stolen by a gorilla. We are searching for her. I take lots of large hair pins out of my long blonde hair and drop them in a pool of water. They go "plop, plop." Some nice man is watching me in the dream. I then go to a banquet. There lots of long tables. One man wearing a red shirt sits at a table. I am interested in him and vice versa. I walk past him and sit at the foot of the next table. Another man (possibly Howard), comes over to sit next to me. I firmly place my arms across the place setting on either side of me. He says, "Oh, can I sit here?," (new to me). I say, "No." Then he says, "How about here?," and chooses a chair next to the place next to me. I shrug and say, "O.K." He then chooses one more chair removed from me and sits. I feel good. I flirt with the man in a red shirt. (196 words)

Two people were digging a path in the sand to channel water to flow to the ocean from a large house. There were two paths. The water flowed by the house. A fence of water was in the middle of the one close to the house. I asked my brother to push back the fence so I could walk in the water to follow it to the ocean. It was resistant but he could move it. I then waded to the ocean. I was disappointed to see that the water hadn't made it that far. I saw sand and dirt. I felt the channels were wasting water. I saw the ocean waves coming up the dry path and covered it all. Then there were a series of tasks I had to do to be able to leave the house and go on my own. I did these all successfully, except the last one which was very hard. I had to look at a picture and weave a reproduction of it. I attempted it but the weave was loose. It was close enough. Someone, a girl cousin, was snotty to me. I then was figuring out my monthly payments on my van. 7 to 9 months at $125 each month. $105 was principle and $20 was the finance charge. I figured I'd have it paid off in a few months (July or August). (232 words)

Blake, his wife and adopted son came by to visit me. I was glad. I enjoyed the talk. There was a small sense of uncomfortableness because Blake and I used to have a relationship, but we all worked at it being comfortable. I thought that even though they didn't make it to my party, at least I see them now. It was a good thing that I called them. I asked Blake to hang around and watch me work. I was learning new stuff. He agreed. I got suited up for surgery. I was like a practicum student at an emergency surgery. We went into the emergency surgery room. It was a party atmosphere because it was like "Super Bowl" day. We all agreed to chose code names. Mabel was given a name and I said, "No. It's better to call her 'clown'." We looked at each other, agreeing. I felt good I made this connection because the name had significance for her and I remembered I was "collected try" or something like that written in lifesavers. My brother Dwight or Cory was chastised for being uppity because he was a counselor. I thought, "Ha, they have snobbish classified staff here too." The teaching doctor asked me if I wanted to stay and watch. I said, "Yes, for a while and I also want to spend part of the day out front working," (intakes, etc). My old block car, the comet, was in the dream somewhere. They started talking about which team they rooted for. I thought, "No, I want to root for...," and then thought of the "M's," but I wanted to root for the M City team but I couldn't remember their name. (285 words)

I'm trying to hold a gray kitten. It's fighting me. It holds its body rigid and waits for me to relax my hold so it can spring away. I pet it and talk to it. Dylan holds it for a while and soothes it down. It starts to purr. Then I try again. It goes rigid again, but after a while it starts cuddling up and getting cute and friendly. I feel very pleased. I decide to chose this kitty to take home with me. Then it plays cute tricks and is very entertaining. I am at Aunt Elaine's house and cousins Dora and Willie are there. It's like Christmas. There are pretty ornaments. Some are a chance game. You put on an ornament in a certain way and win the game. I look for those kind but none are left. I see some pretty ornaments you just hang on the tree. They say "free" on them. It's kind of tame though. Then Ethan and cousin Willie find glass things that you can whistle through. They start a "jug band." I grab one and show how I can do high, clear notes. They signal that I can join them but only be the rhythm section and just blow the note every so often to accent their sound. A crowd draws around. Willie and Ethan put on a show and I tag along. I can't hear my note, it's so high, but the crowd can. It's loud and piercing to them. The crowd is milling around. Willie and Ethan get on a big truck (18 wheeler), and drive around, leaving me behind. I look and the crowd is using this opportunity to escape. I feel a little sad and embarrassed for Willie and Ethan who think they're putting on a great show. Then, 2 policemen come in. I play more notes. I can hear them more. They see a beautiful, sexy woman in a box with mirrors. If you guess where she really is, you go get her. They figure it out and get her and then they all play a game (like slot machines). I go up and look at the box. There are signs on it that say "no touching, etc." I lift up one mirror to peek in. I see one mirror slides up diagonally so the image is thrown in a different direction. I look down at the bottom and figure out she must be down there. (410 words)

I was feeling tired and my father was concerned. We were at Grandma Agnes' house. We got in the car to go somewhere. Then, for some reason, I needed to go back to the house. I got out to walk back, feeling annoyed that I'd have to walk all that distance. My father felt badly about it as well, so he walked part of the way with me along a dirt road, somewhat muddy. After I got going, I saw that I was O.K. and told my father I could make it by myself and he could go on. I went on alone. As I got near the house, a man was following me. I went in, to the enclosed front porch. He came in and talked. I suspected him. He might have tried to make advances. I felt my father's concern. Then I decided he was not going to hurt me and he went on his way. (158 words)

Something awful happened to the Earth. I see oceans, no land. I'm like flying overhead looking for a place to land. I see some coral reefs peeking out of the water. I think about landing there, but a huge wave comes and sweeps over it, so I go on looking. Finally, I see mud flats. Then I decide to live on the water. Why not? I build a house on a raft. It's square and tight (compact). I have furniture. I realize that someone, a man, is coming to find me. He's from the other side (a war hero maybe)? I hide in a closet. He comes in and looks around. I watch him through peep holes. He senses where I am and opens the closet. I crouch down in a dark corner; he feels around and finds me. I am angry at him. "How did you guess? How did you know I was there?," I ask. He points to the cloth covering I used to camouflage the door. It was wrinkled. I straightened it out. He thinks I'm a criminal (being on the other side), but I know I'm not. I'm snotty to him, uppity. He sits on the couch. I start doing dishes. Then I put on boots to go outside on the raft. There's something out there. It's a pet, but scary too. I realize (again), that I must wear foot coverings because of possible poison things I could step on, but they've been stolen along with my can opener and other survival, important items. I go out pretending my bare feet are covered. I look out over the water. It's cold, deep, and dangerous. A white with black trim whale or dolphin slides up to raft and squeaks. I smile, I like it and I'm afraid of it. Then I go back in. Next we are at a party, on land. I see the man that had stolen my survival items. I ask him to dance; he doesn't recognize me. As we dance, I charm him and then look him in the eye and tell him the bad thing he did to me. He denies it and backs away. I decide it doesn't matter. I let him go. The man (who found me), has watched and now understands the difficulties I have had to struggle with and appreciates my courage. I feel aloof and independent. (399 words)

Ginny and I rush home because Blake and Keith are going to come over to visit us for dinner. As we come into the lobby of the apartment building, we see Blake and Keith. They are drunk. "Wahoo," we think. I'm in a hurry to get to the kitchen to finish dinner prep. We go up an elevator. It's not the regular one. It's skinny. I think, "Hum. No room for a wheelchair." We then are in a store where everything's on sale, Wards/Penny's. I try to get through the jumbled aisles, but everything and everybody is in my way. I walk over and around jumbled boxes of slippers. I see some that have heels high enough I could wear. I'm interested but keep going. People are in the way. I try another way, clothes and appliances. I see an automobile tuning light for only $64. I decide that's a good deal, but I'm concerned because I've already over spent. Blake follows me. I look and under his overcoat he's hollow, empty. The coat is stiff, like looking up a christmas tree or a toy. We roll him to the apartment. I finally get there. Ginny buys something. The sales lady demands to know if she paid her $11 monthly money yet. Ginny gives a disjointed explanation (half lying). (219 words)

I'm sitting in a bed. Fletcher (from acting class) is in a manual wheelchair. There are many doors to this room/area. One in front of the bed is glass and leads to the street. I'm in a hall of a school building actually. Fletcher needs to go to bathroom, so he goes down stairs (in chair). He says it's the best route for him. I decide I have to go to the bathroom, so I choose to go out the glass door, in my chair. I feel nervous, strangers, so I go back in and lock the door and the screen door. I go down the stairs, in my chair, a butt-controlled ride. Part way down, there's a metal rod sticking up to slow runaway chairs. At this point, I get up. It's easier to walk. The stairs have been messed up by Fletcher's chair rides. The carpet is rumpled and some stairs are long or missing, making the walking uneven. I look for a bathroom. I see two doors. The name plaques are Italian, and lots of decals and graffiti are on doors. One said "terrier ricotta," or something like that. I stop a young kid (early 20's), janitor, and ask him, "Which one's the women's room?" I feel annoyed. I think I'm in the performing arts class area because the Italian words are from opera class. He can't remember so he sticks his head in one of the doors. A woman comes out. She says she knows it's the women's room because she did the sigh change. I thank both and go in. The room is a mess. There are toilets all around, but no stalls. I sit on one, the most protected from view. As I bare my ass, a guy comes in. I'm really annoyed and I stand up, covering myself. Then I sit down again and discreetly try to cover myself. He mutters some apology. He's looking for something. My mother/older lady is upset and insulted. He drops his white cane as he backs out. The I pick up a life magazine and see an article on Elizabeth Taylor. The picture moves; it's a movie. The narration talks about how expressive and white her hands are. She has been in an accident and is a para. Her hands are lovely but are nervously clenching and unclenching one another. I get up and go back to bed. I want to make sure all the doors are locked. Something is making me nervous. Then Elizabeth appears in my room. She's upset and wants to explain to me about the "Life" story, something about a lost baby. We go back downstairs. Chuck sees us from across room. I know he's going to recognize her and really want to talk to her, see her, feel her. He does. He comes over. He goes, "Wow! It must be neat to be so beautiful." Elizabeth and I look at each other like we understand each other. I explain to Chuck that to look like she does leaves herself wide open for guys like Chuck to walk up and take her time and energy. They insult her. They are dumb, and they think they are being smart, cute, and sexy, but it's boring and anger-producing to have to always deal with non-understanding jerks. She and I go back into the bathroom to look at "Life" magazine and talk. (566 words)

I am older, maybe late forties or early fifties. I audition for a part in a play. The teacher, a woman older than me, doesn't approve of me. I don't get the part. I then go into the cafeteria of a school. I am wearing a bright red suit, and my hair is carefully done via beauty parlor (blue). I am given the silent treatment because I'm different. I feel confident and self-righteous. I know I'm doing the right thing and I smile to myself. I can handle this. (89 words)

I am even older, late 60's or so. I go back and audition again. I tell them, "I know the play was written for two young women and a little boy, but I think it would be good material to do the play with older players, but don't change any of the dialogue." They reluctantly agree. I go home now, after talking to the middle-aged man who got the part of the little boy. I am now on roller skates. I can't remember exactly where my house is. If I turn left, I go up hill. If I turn right, I go down hill. I turn right knowing that it is harder to roller skate down hill. I have trouble stopping. The ride is like a roller coaster. I look for rough surfaces to slow me down. I find my house. There are lots of people on the front lawn. I join them. It's a meeting. Ethan is the leader. I listen, then decide it's time to act. I raise my hand and say, "May I have permission to write 'Dear Friends and Colleagues'," a P.R. letter about the play. He agrees. The others are amazed at my braveness. I had a job to do and I did it. (209 words)

Another person and I are at a zoo. Two large and dangerous wild cats get loose. They start chasing us. We run and end up cornered in the empty hay loft of a barn. To defend myself, I pull out two small short bladed rickety pocket knives. They are dull. The sassy mountain lion comes up close and pulls out his pocket knife, which is like mine. I feel afraid because I am inadequately defended. He and I circle each other and then we start to laugh at the silliness of the situation. We agree to be blood brothers. He cuts his thumb with his knife and I cut mine with my knife and we mix the blood. Then we talk about how we can work together. I point out that if he stays in a particular area, he won't scare the neighbors and I'll give him classes and teach him enjoyable things. I introduce him to 3 teachers. Then I see a well-manicured hedge. (165 words)

I am a counselor. A client calls on the phone. She is pretty upset. There's lots of activity, so I step out in the hall and pace back and forth as I talk to her. I calm her down and remind her to read the instructions I've given her. I say, "They're things I wrote." She complains that there aren't 3 things. I read them to her and then she sees them. Some persons from Bulgaria or Greece come and offer me wine. I try it. They are selling their wares. I see a price list. Everything is made by XXX and cousin George. Then, I am a Greek. I can become invisible at will. I want some truckers to pull their truck over to my spot on the side of the road to buy my wares, food and wine. They are mean and make fun of me, so I turn invisible and use the force of my mind to make them pull over. I wear a wreathe of flowers in my hair and dance in front of their truck and they follow. I lead them to a spot of grass where I have marked their tires and engine number. They pull up there. I have a banquet table set up for them. Then I see a national hero. He's driving a tank in the water. I go near to see and get caught under the tank treads. I become invisible so I won't be hurt. As they are Greek, they can see me and know I'm there and are concerned for me. I hold my breath and let the tank run over me and then I get up, unhurt. I go back on shore. The two Greeks join the banquet. They are very intrigued by me. For some reason, I encourage the mean truck driver. We all sit down to eat, the Greeks on either side of me. I am very beautiful.

Shannon and I go on a vacation, just like last time. We get into a VW bug. She starts to drive. We stop at a restaurant to use the rest room. We carry our cats in. I have a Jay cat (a cousin of mine). She has Mama cat. Jay cat looks up at me, and asks if Papa cat is coming on the trip, I say, "No, but Mama cat is. We'll have a good time." Then I point out my new "jivin'" hair cut. I choose to drive the rest of the way to give Shannon a rest. I carry the suit cases. I think maybe we'll take a different route this time. I think of Tennessee. [BL] (119 words)

I'm with the girls, visiting. Howard comes and says he's moving to S City. The girls are concerned and ask me if they can still visit me. I said, "Well, I have to ask my parents first because it's their house." My mother assures me that they can come. I feel glad. We start to make arrangements. Then Howard changes. He wants to talk to me. We sit on a couch at opposite ends. Howard tells me he's going back to school. He's changed now. He's going to become a lawyer. I keep emotional distance and sneer a little at his social climbing ways. Then he starts creeping closer and closer to me and I get that sick, trapped feeling again. I look at him. He's young now; he's lost weight and his fingers are long and slim. His eyes have an Oriental slant to them and his skin is brown. I say, "Oh, you look all different," and describe it. He's concerned and has a whimpery quality to his voice and keeps physically sneaking up to me. I ask him to explain again his schooling he's going for. There is a couch pillow between us. He's trying to get around the pillow. He wants us to be together again. I then realize that he's a "Monnis." He's going to S City for a month for training and then to school. Now the couch is a bath tub and he's trying to lay down beside me and I move away. He has puppy-like eyes. I feel sad for him. I feel trapped. I run. I go to an office. Now I want to go to the seminar training to see what's happening, like a spy. I ask the secretary. She says to type the letter "E" and I will get in. I try to. I hit lots of letters and finally get a E typed. They aren't thrilled but I'm accepted (and a friend, woman), we go. As we walk down a hall, I see I'm in a zoo. There is an enormous gorilla. I'm afraid of him and I try to avoid him seeing me, because Howard is near him. He sees me and winks at me. I go near. Howard is listening to his every word like a slave. I go on. I get out. Then I'm driving into a state park at the beach. The girls and I are on a vacation and returning to a place we've enjoyed before. It will be fun. I write a poem. Some men read it and look at me with respect. One says, "It's not a poem in the traditional sense but she has talent, rhythm. It's good." (448 words)

My grandmother Mildred is ill. She is dying. She wants grandpa Lloyd with her. We are in the living room. I see grandfather coming in to see her. He is younger looking and thin. He smiles and looks like he's gone through some emotional changes, like he's finally in touch with his feelings. Grandma is scared and needs his support. He knows that and gives her a present and talks about how he'd love to be there with her but he just can't, so much to do, etc. He talks like her and I look at my parents and think, "See you all ways got on her case but she learned it from him." He's trying to do the polite thing and escape. She's practically begging him to be real and close with her. It's like grandfather has just discovered warmth and youth and knows he hasn't long to enjoy it and is insensitive to her and wants to leave her. He starts to leave. I am angry. I run after him and grab him at the porch. A younger cousin (with eyes like my kitty), wants to talk to him and gets there first. I say, "Grandfather, I want to talk with you." He says, "Well, I have to leave now, and he was here first." I look at the cousin and look at him, silently pleading for him to understand my need and then say to grandfather, "How can you do this to her?!" I then feel empathy and say, "I know you need XXX. I know you XXX, but she needs you. How can you be so cruel to her?" He's walking to the car and I'm following, crying, "Grandfather! Grandfather!," and sobbing. He won't listen. He's on his way.

A flying dream. Sometimes it was easy to get up and soar. Other times, it was a real struggle. I was in a large department store. I had to fly above florescent lights and under wires. It was a struggle. Then, Bonnie and I visit a woman. She brings out her old maternity clothes for Bonnie to try on. We both say, "Oh, how cute!" I say, "...But it's not my style, thank goodness." It's tailored, peter pan collar, pleated skirt, and brown. I look at myself and remember what it was like to be pregnant and I'm relieved I'm not. I then fly again. I'm in a grocery store. I pick out bananas and other things. I look around for a store clerk. I ask Cory if he snuck some ham before he went to chicken. He said, "Yes." I start to. I'm afraid I'll get caught but I don't have enough money to buy all the food I need. (161 words)

Two doors, one marked "Men" and one marked "Women." I go into the men's room because I am guiding a man through. I hope no one's in there to see me. I'd be embarrassed. The door opens into a narrow hall and goes to another door which opens into a school hall with offices off of it. Then I am going into one of the offices to talk to Leif, an older PE teacher. He's upset about one woman student. I reassure him. As I talk, I put one hand on his arm. His eyes warm up and he puts an arm near my shoulder and leans closer. I see this and try to make him realize that I'm just trying to reassure him, not fall in love with him. I then go out, across the yard to try the dormitory. I walk in. A woman, Virginia, one of my roommates, tells me the dryers are broken. There are lots of them in a row (clothes dryers). I look them over and push buttons. Virginia is already to go over to Leif and complain. I tell her not to. "He's happy now and besides, they're working O.K. now." She walks out with a blue dollhouse to show him. She's glad he's happy now. I suddenly feel glad to be alive. Things are working out O.K. I am in running shorts and decide I'll get back into jogging every morning at 6:00 a.m. I look out the window (venetian blinds, open) and feel happy. (253 words)

I'm traveling the U.S. in the late 1800's. I meet up with Burt Lancaster, another woman, and her young son. We travel together. It's winter. The woman asks me to take a huge ice knife and cut blocks of ice (we're on a lake). I say, "I'm afraid to. I'll slip and fall in or it will crack and go out from under us." She does it herself. Burt falls in love with her. She is married already to some disagreeable wimp. He doesn't like having Burt around but accepts it because Burt is strong and will save the family from disaster. The woman learns ways of survival in the wilderness from Burt. He puts an animal on a rock. A huge bird swoops down and kills it. I cry (I'm a daughter, I think). I think that's cruel. Burt says, "He had every chance for survival. He had to fight. He lost." I feel awful. Then Burt is talking to a young, pudgy boy who is really a squirrel. His eyes are squirrel's eyes. He tells the boy he's a squirrel and will be left on his own to survive. The boy listens and then changes physically into a squirrel. He runs and is safe. I'm glad he's safe. Now Burt's in San Francisco on a sailing boat. I'm the first mate. We decide to sail back to our starting point. I start to cast off. Burt asks me if I have my cigarettes. I look. I'm lighting the wrong end and it's smoking wrong. I say, "Hey, let's sail overland." We do. We're going on a dirt road. We meet up with that family again. I hear someone saying to the woman, "Oh Mr. XXX is here. Have you ever met him?" She and her son run to see Burt. He's in a tavern. A woman sort of pretty, shy, and he are hugging. Another woman, sophisticated, wearing black and red (saucy) cuts in. He likes them both. The first one feels put out but hangs in there. (340 words)

I am in Germany at a bus depot. I am trying to find out if I can get on a bus with my wheelchair. I know a few words in German "Was ist das?" etc. Didn't look too promising. Everyone is concerned because things weren't accessible. Then I'm in my green pickup. I think Howard, or another woman (myself), is with me. I suggest we get on a subway car and we talk about leaving the chair in the pickup. We're standing out on a sidewalk discussing ways and means. I notice we're standing in front of a hospital. I suggest we go in there, in case I start going into labor. We go in. The person with me is all excited and wants to check me right in. I get embarrassed and squat down beside him or her. I whisper, "Please don't. I've been thinking, I'm not even sure I'm pregnant." I look at my tummy and realize I'm not, and it would be embarrassing to get checked in for labor and I'm not even pregnant. My friend then goes in to talk to a doctor. Now I'm really embarrassed. She comes back and says, "The doctor wants to talk to you." Now I'm a little angry too. I decide to leave. I then see Andrea. I start to pat her on the arm and remember not to. I say, "Imagine seeing you here in a hospital in Germany." She looks at me like she doesn't know me and starts talking about where she might have met me. I just smile at her little joke, not completely sure it's a joke. (272 words)

There is a social gathering. A man (like Harrison Ford), comes in and talks to people. He sees 2 women and a girl and comes over and talks to them. He knows one woman. He talks and then meanders on to talk to others. The next night, the same thing. The one woman starts waiting for him, a budding romance. Then one night, she and her daughter are waiting for him and watch him come in to the party. He doesn't come over. The daughter makes a snide remark. The woman gets upset because he doesn't come over, so she gets up to leave. That will show him. She gets to the door, hoping he'll care enough to boogie over. He sees it and does come over. The woman is glad. Now we're at the race track; he's a jockey and he's good. He wins a race. The next race is won by another young man, a friend. After the race, I (the woman) walk and he follows after to talk. So does the cocky young kid that won. He's full of energy and still wants to race. My male friend says, "Wait." He goes and gets his horse, a spotted pinto and another one. I get up behind him and he leads the other horse, so I have one to ride later. We ride like the wind. I wrap my arms around him and hold on tightly. I like him and I think he likes me. We're doing this to help the kid because he has so much energy, he would get into trouble if we don't help him. After the race, we go to a fenced-in dirt area. I get off the horse and lay down, my head pillowed in the dirt. It's comfortable. We're laying around, talking. A plain clothes cop comes up and starts asking questions. What's our names, etc. He asks a woman her name and the names of her two children. She gives false names. He leaves. She explains why she did that. He comes back and asks my name. I think about lying but then decide to tell him the truth. I say, "Barb Sanders." He says, "What?" I repeat it, very calmly and sure of myself. He then arrests the kid. The other gal goes to the kid and says, "Tony, I love you." Harrison and I look at each other. I had thought Harrison loved her at the beginning. The kid is happy that she loves him. Harrison comes over to me and says, "Remember at the beginning? It was because I knew her that I talked with her. I love you." I feel happy. Now they're being taken off to Russia to work off their debt. I wait for him. Then there is a composite letter. It is started by a Russian. It goes to Harrison, then to Tony, and then to me and the other girl and the guy's dad. The Russian starts it. It is simple English. I am standing on farmland reading it. The father is a lawyer. I know that soon, I'll have Harrison home with me and love him. (524 words)

I'm going to an open house of new rooms at the community college. 3 VR counselors are going to move on campus. Zach is there. I ask him who the 3 will be, wondering if Blake will be there. He won't. I exclaim on the ornate and lovely wood work, banisters, etc. I ask why the hall is so narrow. Even VR doesn't understand about architectural barriers! Mabel and I go out. She gets a key out and opens a cubby hole to get a vase for her office. I see doll houses in there. I want them 5-6-7. I say, "Hey, I could use one of those in my office," but I want the one in the library (it's big and beautiful). These are seconds that have been stored. I ask if my key will do the lock. Mabel says, "Yes." I try to lock it up. It won't lock. My key will open it, but it won't close it. Mabel and I laugh. We then go to her pickup truck to go to the the community college party at the XXX Inn. We drive and can't find it. I ask some boys and they say, "Through there," pointing to a warehouse. Mabel drives in. I walk in. I see rows and rows of farming equipment. I am sure the boys are wrong. I go back to the entrance to find Mabel. I find her. We see people in Halloween costumes going up a hill. She says, "Keep an eye on that one, and I'll follow this other one." I walk fast. I am annoyed that I have to walk so far. There are lots of stairs and hills, and my body will hurt and I won't be able to enjoy the dance. As I walk, I realize I don't hurt. I feel good. I'm in a shopping center. I go down a long flight of stairs. There are rows of socks for sale and I have to walk on them. I get to the XXX Inn. Some people are already there in costume. I have my costume on, my brocade coat, a purple shawl, and a pretty old fashioned dress. I walk without a cane or a limp. I want no one to know who I am so they'll talk about me and I'll hear what they really think of me. The party hasn't started yet. I see Ethan, and he's with his wife. He follows me around and watches me. I sing a song. My costume changes to a more revealing and younger costume. He and I are standing. He comes closer and closer as he talks. Then I'm sitting on his lap. He says, "My arms belong around you. I love you both," (meaning his wife too). He wants to kiss me and I'm drawn to him but move slowly. I also don't want to. As we walk I say, "People here don't give the disabled a chance to perform." He smiles and says, "Me too?" I say, "Yes." He says, "You aren't performing because you aren't good enough. You haven't matured." I feel hurt. I disagree. I say, "I didn't want to be a mistress." I get up and go to the dance floor. I start dancing to show him I could do it. A guy dances with me. I'm good and Ethan is impressed. The guy does a fancy step that involves dropping into a hole under a doll house. As part of the dance, I peek in and see him. I like the inside of the doll house. I want to go in too, so I drop into the hole and go inside. Ethan is somewhere watching me. (615 words)

I get 2 free coupons and I'm at the jewelry counter in a drug store. One is for 50 pounds of 50 shells (sea shells). The other is for a watch band. I have a $5 bill and a couple of ones. An old guy comes in, throwing money away. He's drunk or crazy. Others run and pick it up and encourage him. I stand at the counter and feel embarrassed. He gives me some coupons and some $l bills and a $5. I'm concerned that he shouldn't do that, he'll regret it later. Yet, I need the money so I just stand there. I push away the coupon and feel sad because I don't get much money. Finally, the woman at the counter comes to wait on me. She's harried because another person has a coupon for 50 shells and it's tedious work. The person has to sift through and pick out each one and then she has to examine each one because one might have gotten a valuable one and she's very conscientious. It's a family store. The drunk man turns into a Mickey Rooney type with a gun. He's going to rob the place. Now I stand a chance of loosing even the meager $8 I had of my own. I see watch bands and I'm looking for a cheap one that would fit a watch face I have at home. The guy is waving the gun around. The father of the family that owns the store tries to help the Mickey Rooney guy who is now a baby named Tom. He gets him pinned at the door. I run to a phone to call the police. The father says, "No, we're not going to call the police because I want this baby Tom to set things right and straighten out." At first I am worried; the father's really dumb and will lose. Then I see that Tom is touched by this and gives up his gun. Now Tom is a member of the family. A brother gives up and introduces himself to Tom, a smaltzy happy ending like in a Father Knows Best show. (358 words)

Someone broke a leg, a girl. We needed to get her to a hospital room. A young man and I got her to a hospital room. I got her a pretty vase and filled it with champagne. I thought the young man gave her the champagne. He was being very supportive and then I went to tell the friends where she was. I find them, crowded in a room watching T.V. or something. They were supportive and gave me and the guy good food for free, like we could take it with us and save the price of an expensive meal. Then, I was on a boat trying to drive it. I'm going in circles. 2 big rocks and a road I narrowly miss. I was trying to sneak in where all the fancy ocean liners were. I snuck around narrowly missing the rocks and the road. It was pitch black outside. I stopped and looked around. I was surrounded by the beautiful lights of all these fancy ocean liners. I didn't want them to find out I was just a scow. There was something wrong with my engines. I tried to pull up to a side dock. A fancy ocean liner pulled up to assist. I tried to make light of it so they'd go away. They pulled a lever and my ship tipped on its side. They were going to look at my engine. I didn't want them to because then they'd know. The young man got a plum ball and checked the angle. I said, "45 degrees," but it was like 90. They discovered the fraud and I ran away. They yelled. Now I was going to sell papers to make some money. I got a bunch of newspapers and tried to get in a tree so people driving down the street could hear me. I used two white crutches (old fashioned y-shaped), to try and I got in the tree. I asked Zoe to hold it for me as they went sliding around. I got up there and yelled, "Papers! Get your paper here! 25 cents!" The name of the paper was La D. It was trashy (like the National Enquirer). People drove by. I was embarrassed but it was the only paper I had. A young man came over and looked up at me. He said, "I'll buy a paper." I feel glad and embarrassed. I liked him and didn't want to give him trash. I dug through my pile of newspapers; one had a hole in it. Another was missing a section. I looked for a nice one. I found one and saw it was a classy paper, like the Tribune, or something. I gave it to him. He said, "Here is 75 cents," and handed me lots of coins. I had 2 dimes in my hand all ready. I started to figure out the change. He softly said, "You don't owe me any change. It's O.K. I want you to look at me closely. When you grow up, we're going to be in love." It was a nice feeling. I looked at him. (520 words)

Ernie is in a car. I'm talking to him. We are parked in front of a house that sits between the old M City house and Dora's house. I see Mrs. XXX. I go to her old house to get something. I wish they'd move in again. Ernie drives me to my driveway. He says he'll come back and pick me up a little later. I gather up my things that are in a disorganized mess on the seat, papers, a T.V. guide, appointment book, etc. I start to walk toward the house. Someone comes out, a bad guy. He stops me. He has a small person on his back. He makes me the one that has to whip the little person to death. I am appalled. I'm being forced into it. A crowd gathers. I/Ernie slowly pick up the whip and I/Ernie get an idea. I/Ernie start beating the little person, so cleverly that the sting of the whip hurts the bad guy more. I move the whip to the back of the bad person's knees and whip and whip and whip until he drops. I am exhausted but proud of myself. I lift up Muffin Cat and say to the crowd, "I want you to meet the one who really did it," but the crowd isn't paying any attention. They are going to listen to a woman sing. I try to speak louder, but they don't pay attention. I pet Muffin Cat and say, "It's O.K. You did a good and clever thing." (255 words)

A friend and I were driving to R City. I was combing my hair. I was going to get married. I had impulsively decided to get married and I chose my brother Dwight. Somehow it was O.K. because the reason I was getting married was to keep other men away, so it wasn't incest because we wouldn't have relations sexually. I got to R City and I realized that I forgot to bring my wedding gown. I was embarrassed and felt badly. I called my parents and asked them to bring it down in time for the wedding. I felt badly about asking this favor of them. I could have remembered it in the first place. I always ask my parents to bail me out. I felt guilty. It then occurred to me that if I was getting married, they should want to be there, anyway. It occurred to me then that I was getting married to my brother, and I got cold feet. I got embarrassed. The reason I had earlier, didn't hold up now, and I felt appalled that I would consider incest. I was embarrassed. "What would people think?" I remembered that as a younger person, I had really thought it would be nice if I could marry Dwight. I felt repulsed by the idea now. (219 words)

Darryl calls me up. He's sick and needs help. I tell him a friend is coming to him right now. We talk. I then remember to ask him, almost as an after thought, "Should I send an ambulance?" He says, "Yes." I ask directions to his house. He says, "Up the hill, turn right on the electronics side of the building." I say, "Don't worry, it's on its way." I get in my pickup truck and drive to the hospital to meet him. I get there. Chuck drives himself to the hospital in a bright red VW bug. He looks sheepish because he didn't wait for the ambulance. We are leaning out of our car windows talking. He says he used to work for an ambulance and therefore was embarrassed to use it. He looks for a place to park. I realize I'm in his parking space but don't move. A car in front of me leaves and he parks there. (161 words)

I think it's time to wake up and go to school (high school). I get up, embarrassed and sleepy. I'm late, so I hurry. Then on my way to school, I wake up again to discover that I had been crawling on my belly to school sound asleep. I hear a Dixieland Jazz band with a good thumping bass. I look up and see dial-a-bus drivers marching down the street like a parade. I hear Herman saying that he can play good bass and if they'd liven up the music, he'd play for them. They politely smile and keep on going. He's too hippie for them. I look at my watch and I see that it is 3:20 a.m. No wonder I'm so sleepy! I can't believe it. Here I am at the entrance to school, not dressed (in my pj's). I see others dressed and going to class so I figure my watch must be wrong. I look at a clock at the school. It says 4:00 a.m. I think, "How weird. Usually it's 3:30 or 4:00 p.m. when I go home and here I am going to school at the same time only a.m." I go down the hall. A girl (Anita) goes by. I ask her the time. She says, "ll:00." Now I'm late and have missed my first class and a half! I feel confused and silly. I tell her what I had done. We go into the bathroom. I decide to take a bath. I get in the bathtub and realize that I had not bothered to take my clothes off! I had started to pull my jeans down but there I am, shoes and all soaking wet. I am amazed at myself and call Anita over and exclaim, "I'm so sleepy I didn't even take my clothes off. Now how am I going to go to class? I don't have any other clothes." She says, "Don't worry. There's always some clothes laying around in a suit case. We'll find something." Then I see some dresses and shirts of mine and I say, "Oh ya, I forgot. Here's some of my clothes I've left here before." I feel embarrassed because if I'd been thinking clearly, I'd have known that and she wouldn't be helping me. I'm still standing in the bathtub. I pull the plug to let the water drain. I see that I've had a bowel movement and I'm embarrassed. A laundry basket with clothes and towels is in the tub with me. I'm still standing. I'm tired of standing and I resent the fact that I didn't get to take a relaxing bath. I start to fold clothes. Anita is helping me. She sees the bowel movement and looks embarrassed. She says, "Don't worry, I'll clean it up," but I can see she doesn't want to. I say, "No, I'll do it." I scoop it out into the toilet and see french fries and fish sticks floating around also. I scoop them out too. I'm glad I took care of it myself and didn't let her do it for me (Anita sometimes reminds me of mother and sometimes reminds me of me.) (529 words)

We're making a 60 second T.V. public anouncement. Donald Duck and I and some other people (men, one black, one white). It is humorous. We laugh and enjoy as we creatively think it up and then act it and then play it back. First, I draw a tracing of Donald Duck for the camera. Then, the men play Donald Duck when the shots involve not seeing the face (stand-ins), one in a tuxedo. Donald Duck picks up a bra made out of 2 top hats and holds them up to his chest. I'm in a cage playing my baby banjo while Donald Duck drives a broom around the outside of the cage and the person in the tux drives a motorcycle. I'm tracing Donald Duck's webbed feet. Now his body is the coast and a technical decision has to be made about how to differentiate the fish in the ocean from his body. Donald Duck is highly dramatic lamenting that he's not unique. He's not the only "genius" or genus species to cry. I'm trying to trace the leg of Donald Duck and I need to connect Route 66 with Centennial Blvd. I make a mis-tracing, but then I figure it out.

It's a hot day. I'm traveling through hot and dusty lands. There are lots of steep hills. I see a river. I take all may clothes off and get in the river and swim up stream. The current gets faster and harder. The water boils around. I go around a corner and see a huge waterfall. It looks like thick plastic. I feel stopped. I struggle to the side bank and sit on the rocks. I hide myself because I'm naked. I call out to Dwight to help me. I exclaim about the waterfall. He comes and looks at it. I ask him, "What are we going to do?" He goes to investigate. Then, I have to cook a dinner for a very authoritarian dad. Dwight gives me directions. I resent having to do things the way the dad dictates. Dad apparently told Dwight and Dwight told me. A younger sister questioned if she could go to store to get milk and we all gasp at her because dad would be angry if he heard her innocently talk about buying impulsively. One waits for sales and buys in weekly or monthly lots to save money. I open a drawer. I find lots and lots of spaghetti noodles. I am going to peel potatoes and look for some fresh potatoes. All I find are rotten old ones. I feel angry and resentful. I look out the window. I see a lighthouse. It is short and fat. I say, "Oh, has it the old lantern in it?" I then laugh and answer myself, "Probably not. They aren't used anywhere any more. It's a shame." Some man is watching us. I plop the dishes on the table, 3 plates. One for dad, one for Lydia, and one for myself. We sit at a huge table. Dwight sits where dad should be. I look startled and then see he's sitting next to dad's place. My plate is accidently too close to dad's plate. I get angry and grab it and move it to my place. The man watches. It's like I'm temperamental and capable of standing up to this dad and he's curious if I'm going to blow up or if I'll just keep all that resentment inside. I feel fake nonchalance. I grumble and say smart things but I don't directly blow up. I feel close to it. (395 words)

Eating dinner at M City house. I'm eating a hot dog. My father yells at me to sit down and eat right. I am standing and freeze mid-bite. I refuse to knuckle under. He says, "If you plan on living here, you'd better do as you're told." I just glare at him and take another bite. Then I get up, go upstairs, pack some things into a few boxes, and stalk out of the house. I am righteous. He's amused; he thinks I'll be back soon. I'm scared. I have no money, no place to go, and I have heavy boxes, but I am determined. I see a motel. Some guy comes out of a room and sees me. He says, "Running away, eh? Well, I'm leaving for the night. You can sleep here." I'm tempted but decide not to because I could get caught if they get a new customer for the room. I go down the elevator. I feel brave because they might ask me what I'm going there. I see the word "lights" in the elevator. I walk all night, carrying my boxes of things. The next day is a school day (M City High). Apparently, I remember I have a car. I put my things in the car and go to school. I get a newspaper between classes to look for a place to stay. (229 words)

I'm in a hospital elevator. A woman nurse puts on a helmet like she's walking into a spaceship. There are lots of beds in a row. I'm in one of the beds. I have to go to the bathroom. I get up and slowly walk down some stairs to the toilet. A girl friend helps me down the stairs and then rushes in to use the toilet first. I am annoyed and think she's rude. I stand there feeling tired and needing to go to the bathroom. I remark that I walked all that way barefooted. Then I go in. I go and go. It's painful and I think, "Oh no, I have a bladder infection. It's just starting. I'll have to take my medicine again." I walk back to my bed. Desmond comes in. I see him and feel shy. We used to be lovers and it's been a long time. I get up and light a candle on the dresser across the room. He sits on my bed. I walk back and sit on the bed. I try to get comfortable. I'm wearing a red shorty nightgown. I am aware of his eyes. I know he'd like to get back together again (like Elliot). Every position I get into looks inviting or sexy. He changes his position too. We get closer and closer. A T.V. is on. We both move to watch the T.V. Now we are very close. His shirt is off. He has beautiful golden soft skin. I want to caress it. I'm laying very close to him. He says, "I see your candle. Is it the one I gave you?" I look at it. It's a beautiful candle, a soft fragrance, pretty color, with lovely colored flames. I say, "No I burned your candle. It's all gone. But I got this one because it's like your candle and I liked it." I am embarrassed because I am indirectly telling him I like him. He starts talking about the old days, when we were together. I feel drawn to him. It's very sensual. He says, "I smell something burning." I look. There are 3 candles burning. One, his candle, is near something and I go over to look. A plant is too close to the candle, and a bud is on fire. I pull it away and put out the flame. Most of the plant falls off. I exclaim, "Look how it's grown. I got this plant this evening. It just had a few shoots and now there are long shoots and 2 or 3 buds." I feel sad that it's burnt and broken, but I feel O.K. because it grows fast and will regrow new buds. In a way, it's like it's been pruned and will regrow faster. I blow out all three candles and get back in bed with Paul. (476 words)

I sitting in a pickup truck on the passenger side. I park near a side walk. Lots of people are parking around me, like we're camping together. A man is angry at me because he parked in that spot before. Then a Japanese man hops in and says he'll help me and now I'm being driven in their station wagon to another spot and I will be with their family, wife, and kids. I don't like that. I want to be alone for awhile. I hesitate and then say, "I'm sorry but could you drive me back to that spot where I was, before someone else gets it. It's important for me to be alone." They look annoyed, but comply. I assure them I'll be all right. I can sleep on the seat if I get tired and the kids can be in the back if they want. The angry young man walks by with his nose in the air. He makes a snide remark. I make a sarcastic remark back. He's angry at me for wanting to be alone. He's like Ashton at uni house. (186 words)

I'm hitch hiking walking back home. I'm on the old highway from N City to M City. When I get to M City, I pick up my van with a wheelchair and drive back to E City. I am really stubborn. I want to walk it. I'm in the fast lane walking, and I decide to go on the side of the road so cars won't run over me. I look over my shoulder several times to see if cars are coming, and then I get on the side of the road. I'm walking fast and I'm hugging the side of the road so I won't get run over. I walk on wooden boards that are attached to chicken houses. It gets real narrow. I have to watch my footing. The chickens are mean. Some bite and I get scared. As I squeeze through near the ones that bite, I whimper and say, "Don't bite." They do a little but I get by. Now I'm on a second story level. I have to move a row of black animals to get to the edge to jump off to get back on the road. I pick up a puppy, a cat, a chicken, etc. and move them. A boy in a cage sees what I'm doing and verbally gives me encouragement. I feel an urgency to escape. I hop down and land in a dishwasher. I try to be quiet. For some reason that puzzles me. I pick up 4 plates, a sugar bowl and its lid. They are white and purple Melmac just like the set I had when I first married. I pick up a towel with holes to cover it up and I start walking. The young, angry, unhappy wife suspects I've taken her dishes and starts to follow me. I try to hide the dishes in the towel but they are awkward and keep slipping and showing through the hole. She gets in her car and tells her husband she's going to follow me to get to the bottom of this. He gently tries to dissuade her. He's on my side. She says, "No," and comes after me. He tells her as an aside that I'm usually in a wheelchair. She doesn't believe it. She asks me belligerently, "Are you usually in a wheelchair?" I say, "Yes, it's in M City. I'm walking to M City where I can pick up my van with a lift and my wheelchair." She is sitting on a chair mounted on the hood of the car and contemptuously offers me a ride to my van. I get stubborn. I don't want to be near her because she'll see the dishes and ask about them. For some reason it's important to walk to M City. I tell her, "I want to walk." I do. She's really angry and follows me. Her kind and patient husband comes along. I am stopped at a swimming pool along the road. All persons must swim before they are allowed through this small town and pay the price of admission. I am annoyed. Captain James T. Kirk is the mayor. I tell him, "I can't swim." He says, "No problem, just wade barefoot in a small pool and I'll let you go on." I clutch my dishes which rattle and keep slipping. I look at the pool. The incline to get to the pool is long and steep. I snort indignantly that I can't walk that steep an incline because of my ankles. He thinks for a moment. He says, "There is another alternative," and goes to his book of city ordinances. It is thick and has tabs with city ordinance #'s. When he opens it up to the one he wants, I look over his shoulder and see it's handwritten and the only one there. He obviously writes the rules as he sees fit, a very shady operation. He sees that the alternative is to go to a meeting of the Ladies Mayhem Society. l The dues are $50. I only have to pay $45 on account of I've already paid $5 for the swimming ticket. I prudently agree. I know I'm being cheated but I want out of there to get away from that angry wife and to get to M City, back on my journey. I think about dumping the dishes but I stubbornly refuse even though I'd be more comfortable without them. I have no use for them anyway. I go on. She follows me. The husband gives me a nice towel with no holes to better conceal the dishes. (767 words)

I'm in bed. Ginny comes and lays down next to me. She says, "Is it alright?" I feel unsure but trusting because we're friends. Then she pats her chest and says, "Here, lay your head on me." I do and she puts her arms around me. It feels very comfortable and safe. I really enjoy it and then I feel very sexually excited. It seems O.K. Then Ernie is there. Ginny and I grudgingly move apart. I want Ernie to go away so I can enjoy Ginny. Then Ginny is married to my cousin Terence. I think, "That's really strange because they are so opposite." She is unhappy. She's now my cousin-in-law. Ernie follows us sadly. Ginny and I are sitting next to each other. She's sadly telling me how he doesn't want her to work. He wants her home being a good housewife. I start to explain that his mother, my Aunt Camille, is an old-fashioned woman. I look up and see Uncle Lionel glaring at me. Other male relatives are sitting in a semi-circle. I still tell the truth but make it sound nicer. Instead of using a tone of voice that is putting her down, I speak softly and loving about how she was just brought up to believe a woman's place is in the home and taught Terence that women are supposed to be in the home. I say, "He won't change." She (Ginny), agrees. I follow her down the sidewalk; her two sons are with her. I think, "They are Ernie's boys. She didn't have any children with Terence." Then, she and I decide to fly away and leave them all. We struggle and struggle, flapping our arms. We can't seem to fly and I almost give up, but lots of men are around and they are an ugly crowd. Now there are 3 of us women trying to fly away. We make a gigantic effort and we start flying. At first, we're as high as the wires and stop and duck that. Then we hit some updraft and flow up into the sky. Soon we are smoothly gliding up and up and don't have to flap our arms. I am concerned because they can shoot at us, so we go as high and as far as we can. We realize that we'll have to hide now. We look for a mountain cabin. We find one. It's a motel. We have no money, no food. We think about ways we can get money. We decide the only way is to be prostitutes. We lure 3 guys in 3 cars to us. I have 3 men in my car, 2 standing and one laying down in the trunk. I sit on top of him. I'm so good that he has orgasm in just a few seconds. I feel a sense of accomplishment. I'm a good prostitute. One of the guys standing hands me $15. I say, "No, I said $50 to $100." He says, "Take it or leave it sister," and sneers. I feel calm. I stand up and put my hands on my hips like Wonder Woman and use my mind power. Their wallets float to me. They look flabbergasted. I smile. I look over at the other two cars. They have done the same. We have lots of money now and we fly away. We go to a mountain resort. We figure we're safe if we go in and register separately as no one knows what we really look like and our wings don't show. The third woman is a platinum blonde. We meet in the restaurant and "make acquaintance." I am looking forward to when we can go to the hotel room where we can be ourselves and not play act. (628 words)

I'm making love with Nate. We roll off the bed onto the floor. He says, "Here, I'll make you feel good and then you can make me feel good." I hesitate because it would be nice to do it altogether, but I get caught up in feeling good. He makes love to me but doesn't enter me, just almost. 3 or 4 people come walking in. I am surprised and then annoyed. I had let one of them live in my house but now his family and friends have taken over. I say, "Hey, this is my home." I get up and ask them to go outside and then feel good that I was assertive. (115 words)

I am dressed as a young boy/man, but I'm a woman. I am in disguise. It's 1800's. A man sees me and seems to take me under his wing. He is quiet, strong and watchful. He knows I'm masquerading and is intrigued by me. There are some ruffians and he saves me from them and suggests I travel with him. I go to get my worldly possessions. I live in an attic room of a big tall building. I go up many flights of stairs. As I am running up the stairs, I feel a mild earthquake. I mutter over and over, "The bricks, the bricks on the roof." I am afraid. Apparently my father or some man had been killed by bricks falling off the roof. We get to the roof. I see bricks falling and a man falling. I grab my duffle bag of clothes and run down the flights of stairs. Out on the street, we get on horses to ride away. This man feels empathy for me and will protect me. [BL] (175 words)

A crowd is gathered. I think we are in Germany. A blind man is trying to show the crowd awards and grants of money our disabled community received for the cause. He unfolds one award and I see the "blue y" raised "$400." The crowd is very impressed. Then the man takes his briefcase with the awards in it and throws it suddenly in a chute. The crowd gasps. He says, "It's worthless. It won't help. What we need to do is march on the president's house, president of a college. I go with him. Most of the crowd goes away. Some follow us. It's dark, so he leads me. We both have canes to feel for holes in the ground as my feet are tender (the ankles). We go to the president's house, passing houses where lesser officials live. We interrupt dinner and present our case. (147 words)

Same house. I am a detective. A woman (me), is terrified. Something is out to get her. She lays on a bed and hears vampires and werewolves hissing and growling in the room. She's afraid to look. Then they go away. She accuses the detective of being a bad guy as he left for a time and could have been the one to hurt her. She calls in some high official/father. The detective (me), denies the accusations and knows that she's really the "bad guy" out to get herself and try to explain it to her. She is actually hurting me with her accusations. (104 words)

I am ironing. My mother is talking to me. She's preparing me for a difficult counseling session. She's annoyed with me because I'm not seeming to prepare as hard or as well as I should. This session is important. It could be dangerous. Some kind of mind games with a powerful older man. I must shift my thoughts and gain access to his. I then see the word "E K CanKar," a store on XXXth and XXX. Something about psychic power. I didn't know that's what the store sold. I'm now interested. Before I figured it was just weird. My cousin Abner, a cardinal, comes to the door. I see him (glass door). He pauses with his hands on the door knob and starts to cry. I am the pope and I go to him. We kneel on the porch outside the door and we say latin things and pray. I am blessing him and helping him to get through that door. (162 words)

I was camping somewhere. I got up and took my pills. I was talking with my mother and Dwight. I then decided to take my pills. I did so. Then I realized with panic that I had taken them twice. At first I thought, "Oh well. I'll be O.K.," but the panic rose and I got up to find a phone to call doctor A. My cousin Willie laughed at me and told my mother and Dwight that I was going to call the doctor. They laughed too. I was very angry and I yelled, "You can just fuck off." My mother said, "What did I say?" Willie or Dwight repeated it. Now I was embarrassed and angry at the same time. I tried to find a phone. I was on a street where there were lots of stores. I realized that I was in M City. I looked at people's faces hoping I might recognize people I went to high school with. I found a phone on the outside of a store. I noticed I was close to my cousin Terence's bicycle shop. I thought, "I guess I'll drop in and say hi after I call doctor A." I looked in my purse for my address book. It was a loose leaf and the pages had gotten loose. I was struggling trying to find doctor A's number. A line of people were standing behind me. I saw two couples that were going together in high school and seemed to be still happy together. I said, "I know you but I can't remember your names." One said, "XXX" and the other said, "XXX." The girls said her name. I took off my sun glasses and said, "I'm Barb Sanders." I took the glasses off again. I was aware of wrinkles around my eyes. They vaguely remembered me. As we were talking, I became aware that I was taking too long and so I offered the phone to the man waiting in line, if it were a quick call. He said, "No, it's O.K. I'll wait." A woman started to help me find doctor A's #. I looked at her and said, "Hey! Hi!" I was glad to see her. I pronounce her name oddly (she was not the one I thought she was). (383 words)

I am in a room with 3 other women. I'm tired. It's late at night. I sit in a woman's lap. We are wearing costumes of some kind. She has her arms around me and kisses me. She tries to "French kiss" me. At first, I don't let her. Then I do. It's not a French kiss, like with tongues. It's like touching the core of something. The lips, a regular kiss, were there and in the center, like in the center of a flower, was a moist, tender, very sensitive to feeling something. We touched "cores." I felt slightly repelled but allowed it to happen. Something in my mind was assuring me this is O.K. It's always been forbidden but now it is O.K. and nice to do. It is important to do. She holds me in a caring way. Another woman is in a closet, sort of narrating thoughts. A slide show is happening. Lots more happened but it escapes me. (163 words)

Maggie and I are somewhere. On our way out, we see a table with piles of books on it. I am interested. Maggie says, "If you're interested, you can take what you want because they were review copies sent to the newspaper." I get up on the table which is now a room with shelves and knick knacks on it. A man, tired, comes by and confirms that we can take what we want. They are of no use to the newspaper. I see miniature doll house furniture, a ceramic persian cat with blue flowers, glassware that is beautiful and a candy dish. I am putting the ones I want in a spot on the floor. Maggie is busy doing the same. Her daughter is with her, sitting and watching. Maggie says, "I feel so young and happy again. It's been so long." Then a grouchy old lady comes by and says that there is a test we have to complete with a fee of $350 + $100. She has a small metal and glass devise. I say, "What?" Then I realize it's a $5 fee. I nod and go on looking at things. I say to Maggie, "I think she'll make us pay. I wish that guy were still here." Maggie says, "Don't worry about it." I ask her what she's found. She points to a red satin with fringe abbreviated outfit. I say, "You sure do feel young and happy." I then start looking on the shelves that she's at. I see beautiful candle holders. Maggie says, "Oh no! Those are mine." I grimace and say, "Are you sure? They sure are pretty." I feel a little envious and then keep looking. I see a scale. I play with it. It breaks open and cookies are there. Maggie gives me a look like, "Now see what you've done." I shrug innocently. "Are those cookies?," I ask her. She nods yes like she's dealing with an idiot and looks over her shoulder, warning me to be quiet so her daughter won't hear. Then I feel something between my teeth. I pull at it. It's a long string of thin pork fat. I pull and pull and it keeps coming. I can taste the pork flavor. I am a little embarrassed and wish it would get out of my teeth. I look over at the daughter. She's doing the same thing, so I don't feel so bad. Finally, I get it all out. I look at things some more. I comment that the woman is still watching and ask again "Are you sure these are free?" I'm just sure they aren't. (441 words)

A group of women puppeteers come by and give a puppet show. It is fun to watch. There is a story about a little girl who went away from her parents and no one could understand why she wouldn't go back. I watch the show and then in payment, I give them my old children's books which they auction off. Ethan buys them. He asks a bunch of dumb questions about which books he has, "And don't I have two copies of Robinson Caruso?" I think, "Well of course, dummy." I am annoyed at his snotty attitude. They were my books and I feel a tinge of regret giving them up. I look in one book and I see a film where Ethan plays a detective. I laugh and say to Ethan standing next to me, "It's so funny. He was my director and all he can do is that one thing and that not so well, anyway." I pick up a book with a gold lame cloth removable cover, to adjust it. One corner, like a corner on a bottom fitted sheet, has come off. I pull it and a picture of a little girl who moves and talks is on the book. As I pull her, she's moving to the edge of the book. She says something about how nice it would be to go back to her parents, or something. I sit on the bed. It's hard to leave my books. A young boy/man grabs my arm and talks incessantly. I yell and kick my feet like a tantrum and say, "Leave me alone. I don't want to talk to you people any more." Some older man pulls him away and says, "Leave her alone, now." (289 words)

A tall young good-looking guy is teasing me. There's an older couple and a 2 year old baby boy. We're in an old-fashioned house. I buy a pair of underpants. The young man playfully puts his hand to feel the underpants. He exclaims, "Ooh, she has on 'seven's'," a name brand of a sexy pair of pants that has a funnel opening where the crotch is. I'm embarrassed and tell him to shush. He and the older man tease me. They say they are going to order some "patties," those are girls that come and help you in your old age. The older couple likes the room downstairs and they go to bed. I hear the baby crying upstairs. I think, "Oh, that's how it is in an old house." It sounds carry. I go upstairs. The young man follows me. To the left of the stairs is a bedroom. It's like an open landing with a bed on it. I lay down. He wants to make love to me. I say, "Why don't you call your pattie." He says, "No, that's for when we're old." I look up at the ceiling. There are rows and rows of beautiful, old-fashioned night tables. Some have kerosene lamps on them. Some have baskets on them. They are all different sizes. I exclaim, "How do they stay up there?!" Why would they (the older couple), have put them up there? It seems an odd sort of thing to put on their ceiling over the bed. The young man continues to pursue. I say, "Not here! The doors are open. If they decide to come up the stairs, we'd get caught!" Then he starts showing me many professional photographs of brides. There are beautiful dresses and veils. One catches my eye. It's an actress from maybe the 1930's or 1940's. She's trying on a dress and her eyes glisten with tears. The dress isn't right on her and she really likes it. It's black, lacy and sexy. The young man is getting annoyed with me. He's been very persistent and I'm not paying much attention to him. Nevertheless, there is some bond between us. We laugh and like each other. (366 words)

I'm in some strange place, like a carnival or a party. There are lots of people. Tricks are played on me. Some of them have dangerous overtones. Some are just in bad taste. I'm in a crowd. Some man and his son are giving me an award. It's a trick cup. The milk spills out of a hole in the bottom onto the table. The son gives me one of his favorite toys, out of 4. I am with my daughter Dovre. We are on a patio. A maroon cloth thing comes out of a hole in a wall. It's a stuffed woman. Her face is set in fake interest. There is a feeling of danger. I sneak away from her. I'm in the bathroom. A woman walks in to help move things around to make it more convenient for me. However, she fixes it so that the scales are near me and the toilet paper is out of reach. I get up to pull my undies up. They are hard to pull up, like a wet bathing suit. Some men wander through and I walk around, pulling my pants up. Some people are shocked, but I feel, "Ha! Serves 'em right if they are going to be where they aren't supposed to be." At one point, I need to escape. I attempt to fly. I struggle and don't get very high. There are tigers clawing up at me and I just barely stay out of their reach. Then I'm looking for a car to leave in. I'm in a parking lot. I see 2 young women/girls. I think one is Dovre. They are in a beautiful, grey, old time car. They say, "Here, you can take this one." I'm very pleased. I say, "Ooh! I can take topa or topaz? Oh, thank you." I stand on her running board and hug her (the car), and feel privileged. (318 words)

Arvonne, Maggie, and I are going to Veneta. We're on a motorcycle. We're almost out of gas. We're going to see a wheelchair basketball game. We're late, but if we hurry, whomever we're going to interview will still be there. It's getting dark. We're all three on the motorcycle. Arvonne is in front steering, I'm next using my legs to help us maintain balance. I say, "Look for a Mobil Station. We can put in $5 worth. We don't have time to fill up both tanks." We see a station and pull in. A grungy old man comes out and fills up one tank. Arvonne hands me 5 one dollar bills, so I won't have to put it on the credit card, which takes more time. Then it's my turn to drive. We're on a heavy and powerful machine. As we start to go, Arvonne says, "Wish we had time to get a beer." The man yells at us (as we're leaving), "I've got something." We stop. We're on a dirt, woodsy road and we look up the hill at him. He's offering us cans of lethal stuff, gasoline, lighter fluid, and says, "It has an alcohol content." We could get that. We look at each other, realizing he's offering us poison and politely say, "No thank you," and leave. We realize a cop is near, and as we are rebels and might get stopped, we walk the motorcycle to the street without starting the engine. It's hard to do. I'm the only one with working legs. I watch the traffic so we can pull in without getting run over. We try to get the motor started and finally, it powerfully kicks over. Then I see a car stopped in front of us. Some one has hit a beautiful dog, a golden animal. I feel sorry for it. I comment that it's not ours. We go around. The road is now covered with ground up crackers and it's very hard to get up the hill! We start to lug down and spin our wheels. Some janitor is at the top of the hill cleaning up the halls of a school. We get to the halls and start to drive. A door is there. We can go out where there's barbed wire or sneak through a locked door. A woman teacher (young), hears us talking about needing to get to the summer activities. George is pointing them out and how we'll sneak through the federal door. She looks disapprovingly. I assure her we won't do that. She offers to show us how to get through the barbed wire back to the road. We carefully step over the wire. She points to a device that tracks and shoots our laser beams to deter unauthorized persons. She says, "It doesn't work," and if we use caution, we can get through unhurt. I point out to her that I see a laser beam. It's slow and misses its mark. Then we sneak past it and go on. (503 words)

Peter M, who is not in his chair, Maggie and I are meeting to work out something about my book. He seems distant and to the point. Like, "Let's get this business taken care of. I need to get going." I talk about the things I want to do with the book. Peter M seems on edge. I try to hurry so he can leave. Maggie leaves. I'm sitting on the floor leaning on big pillows. Peter M is nervously pacing. He walks up close to me, squats down to be on eye level to talk, and then bounces up again. I wanted him to stay. It begins to seem that he's drawn to me, but something is making him want to leave. As I'm talking, I look up. He's near me. I look into his eyes. They are beautiful. I look at his lips and wish he'd kiss me. We almost do. I then remember that once long ago, we were lovers for awhile. I feel very warm and want to hug him. He bounces up, saying something about his wife. I hear it but ignore it. I figure he's too good for me and he'll never like me anyway. Peter M leaves. A cleaning woman is in the room. Peter M then bounces back in. I see he has a horn case with him. I exclaim, "Oh! Is that a French horn?" He says, "Yes." He's embarrassed. "Oh, I'd love to hear it," I say. He pulls it out. I think, "I'd like to try to play it." Paulina has a trumpet and I liked playing it. The sound from the horn is very pretty. I put my good ear right up to the instrument. Even then the sound is soft. I hear two notes at once and exclaim, "How did you do that?" He hands me the horn. I look at it. It has an ornate set of "buttons" like petals carved in wood or ivory. He says, "It's old and ancient and eastern." His basset hound crawls on my lap and wants his tummy scratched or petted. I do it and hug him and call him a sickly hound dog. I see the word hound dog written on a paper. Then Peter M says, "I have a gift for you." He hands me a jar with lots of little compartments. I see papers and things. I open the first part of the jar. I'm feeling very surprised and pleased. He watches me. It's a paper. I read it. It's a series of notes. It starts out as a note from a registrar to him about his needing to add or drop a class. There are then a series of notes by him answered by someone else. I see the name Barb and think, "That's probably his wife." I don't understand the significance of this paper but I want to because it's a gift to me. I open the next gift. I see a series of potholders. I say, "Oh how nice. I can use these." I then exclaim, "Oh, it's miniature. I can put it in the miniature house we've been building." I then see there are lots of miniature things like a stove, and a laundry hamper with clothes in it. I peek under the clothes and see peanuts. My brother Dwight is hovering near by. I want him to go away because this is a special moment with Peter M. I say, "Oh, they are a lot of miniatures and things for the house! How silly of me not to connect that when I first saw them." Then Peter M, whose eyes tell me he cares for me but is slightly turned away from me, says in an anguished voice, "You have about 19 things you need to do in Dover. How are you going to manage it?" He meant I have many creative things to do and how can I support myself and do them too? I feel warmth because he cares. I say, "I don't know. I'll just do it somehow. I've got some ideas. I'm working on it." He looks at me. I think, "How sweet." He wants to offer to take care of me, financially, and be with me so he and I can do these creative things. Then I say, "This summer, Maggie and I are going to do a book. She's a photographer (he grimaces because he is too), and we'll do a picture/story book." I sense he'd like to do that with me. Dwight is still hanging around and I really want him to leave! Then, I look at his next gift. It's a beautiful paint set, brushes, luxurious, colored bristles. I thank him. He's standing again, getting ready to leave. I say, "I'll bet you're getting bored because I'm taking so long to look at your gifts." He doesn't really answer. He's about ready to leave. I want him to stay and he wants to stay. (830 words)

Johanna comes home from work. I have on a clown suit. I put a second clown suit on. I go to the door to greet her. She's tired and doesn't really appreciate my joke of a clown suit on a clown suit. There are gifts for her. She's talking about her students today. Her husband Matt is asking questions about who was there. She's grumpy and gets sharp with him and accuses him of sending some of his students to her. He claims innocence. I listen. Matt is opening the gifts. One is a big box with a puppet inside. Matt says, "It's George Washington." I look closer and I say, "George Washington with six guns?" He's got red hair (long, ponytail), a white suit (like Col. Sanders), and a pair of six guns strapped around him. I look and see his name is "The Chicken" or "Genesis." I say, "Oh, what fun. It's a computer program game. Can I play it?" Johanna mutters, "Oh, I always get those." She's doing the dishes and reaches over to start the game. I push a button to set the balls (like pool balls). Eggs come out, a dozen of them. They come out too fast and some are broken. A yolk goes slithering by me. I exclaim, "Oh no." Johanna finally looks and says, "What happened?" I explain. I'm a little embarrassed. Ronald Reagan comes and sits down with us. He's very interested in things about the west. I explain that this is a computer program. I show him a book about "Little Chicken," a notorious western person. (266 words)

I have a check out stand, for groceries and things. Ethan is talking to me. He likes me. As we talk, my cash register starts malfunctioning. It rings up 55 cents too many times. A long line forms of customers as I try to get the machine to work. Ethan is smiling and talking to me and I'm trying to pay attention to him and also take care of the customers. Finally I decide to write up the stuff by hand. My "bagger," a young girl, complains when I tell her to assist. Then I decide to borrow an adding machine from another stand. I do and everything's O.K. [BL] (109 words)

I'm sitting at a table, listening to a woman cry about how alone she is. This affects an overweight young woman wearing a low lacy sweater with a blue skirt and white blouse. She starts crying. I say, "Ah, she's affected too." She gets up and walks all the way around the table to come and kneel next to me to hug me and cry into my lap. I call her Princess. I think, "Maybe she doesn't realize that when it's my turn, my stomach gets queazy and I have to go to the bathroom." (95 words)

My father is driving, Mabel is sitting next to him. Howard and I are with them in a VW bus. I have a painful boil on my leg. It hurts. I want the pain to go away. I'm waiting for us to get to our destination so Howard can lance the boil and remove the pain. I think to myself, "I don't have to wait for him to do it. Why am I waiting? I can do it myself and get rid of the pain." Mabel is trying to soothe the feelings between Howard and me (I'm the only one in the back seat). I'm angry, grumpy and sad. She says something soothing like, "Give it a chance." I say, "There is no chance. Howard is a sickie, an emotional sickie." We pass a camping area. A man and a young girl are talking. I hear her say, "I killed her. The other girl and I killed her." I see small camp spots with steep boat ramps to the water. There is no place to stretch out and relax, just space to put the car and boat. I see a stream that's rusty colored and polluted. My father comes to a crossroad, a "T." He's going to turn left. The car is too far out into the intersection. 3 vehicles go by, very close, ready to hit us. I flinch as they go by. The 3rd one honks. (238 words)

I'm moving to Dover. I feel sad about leaving my house. I can't figure out why I have done it. I'm moving into an apartment that is next to Rosemary's. Our windows face each other. I want to be next to Rosemary but it's only a one bedroom, a small apartment. I have to leave my pool table and other things at me house in E City. Rosemary and I go for a walk. We're near downtown Dover. We're walking on the freeway across the river. I ask if there are any grocery stores near the apt. She shows me a book store. I enjoy the book store. (108 words)

I'm on a staircase. I see a man coming in the house. I am sneaking backward up the stairs hoping he doesn't see me. He does. I think, "It's the light reflected off my eyes." As he comes toward me, I feel pent up anger and I explode. I start yelling. I tell him off, but well. I am getting ready to be in a play and the crew and Ethan, the director, has grudgingly helped me and I'm sick and tired of it. They offer to carry me down the stairs and row me across the river to get to the stage. I refuse their help, angrily. I'm yelling, calling them names and hitting at them. Ginny is in the background. She's afraid and watching me. I snarl, "Just stay away from me. I'll do it myself." I know I'm going to use all my energy just getting to the play and getting ready and I probably won't have anything left to perform with. Then I think, "It'll hurt but by God, I'll do it." I push them aside and walk angrily down the stairs. I see where the boat should be waiting to row me. They aren't there. I walk through the tunnel under the river. I finally reach the stairs on the other side. I go up the stairs. I'm pulling hair pins out of my hair. I get to the top of the stairs. Ethan comes out. He's placating me, apologizing. I glare at him and yell some more. I'm opening a mirror to put on my stage makeup. One eyebrow is put on the wrong place. The other one keeps smudging. Ethan says to me, "My daughter had a dream about a jury. What can it mean?" I say, "You idiot! She is the jury and the judge!" He says, "But what does it mean?" "It means," I speak slowly and witheringly, "that she is feeling guilt. She is sitting in judgement of herself." He sits back and looks sad and guilty. He's aware that he's partially at fault.

I'm back in history. The knights in shining armor. I'm an outsider and I'm being chased by the palace guards. The Queen mother wants me dead because her son likes me. I'm running up some stairs, and a herd of guards are after me. I run into a cell-like room and I'm trapped. Seconds before they find me, I hide up on a beam near the ceiling. They look for me and then assume I fell to my death as it's a tower room. The Queen is there. Now I hide and peek and sneak around so they don't find me. I hear voices and run down a flight of stairs. Then I hear more voices coming up the stairs. I hide in a cupboard. It's the changing of the guard and a group of soldiers are coming by me. The officer in charge looks into the cupboard but they don't see me. Then I listen to their instructions of who will guard what so I'll know where not to be. There are 2 guards at each of the 2 doors on the top, or the 4th floor. 2 guards at each end of the 4 doors on the 3rd floor, etc. They leave. Then I see a gaggle of young women. One of them is going to be engaged to the prince. The Queen mother has chosen her. She's unhappy because she's sure he doesn't love her. He still is forlorn because he loves me. Then there's an engagement party. Her parents, a King and Queen come. The King wears a black toga with a red scarf or roses on it. She has an ornate head dress, like the one in Alice in Wonderland. The King is plump and annoyed. He doesn't want the match. Then I see a picture of black men in Africa. I think, "Oh that's another story in this book," (I see a book). I hear a narration. The picture is a ragged line of black men, one has only one leg. They are in the fields and are shooting rifles. "They don't know it but they are encountering Jedi warriors," the narration goes. "It's the first battle of the war." I see them freeze-frame and they are all dying, like a firing squad line. One turns a backward somersault from the force of the impact of all the bullets.

I want to go to my bedroom. I'm at a rich and swanky party. I'm told to push a button. I do. The buttons are apples and other fruits. When I push an apple, a bed of red cabbage with cole-slaw stuffing rolls comes out. A woman says, "Oh, good, I don't have to stay in bed all the time. I get so tired of staying in bed day and night."

A man wants me to walk with him. He says he's got a pretty weird family. He lives in a grave yard. I start to walk up some stairs. He's walking on air, on the outside of the stairs. I look and his feet are melting into the stair at each step. I say, "Who do I hear talking?" He says, "It's me." I say, "No, I hear someone on the other side of me." I get a feeling there's an invisible person on my left side. (87 words)

I am a member of a committee. I've been doing lots of extra time getting 4 different areas documented so we can make a report. A man then takes over and says he'll report on the ones I've already worked on and I can start work on some other areas. I am fed up, angry at him. I say, "Look. I've already worked on 4 of these. I have no interest in working on these others." He sighs and glares, and I start to feel guilty. But then my feeling is, "No, I've done more than my share and I'm not going to do other people's work." I say, "He and I can share our reports we did on the same area." He says, "No. It will be one or the other." He leaves. I try to get the committee members to agree on a time when we'll meet next. No one helps. They leave. I look around. There are tons of things left out that someone needs to put away or our work will be destroyed by uncaring vandals. I'm the only one left to do it. Now I'm really angry and I feel put upon. I start to pick things up, boxes and newspapers, and I see that the job is too much. I hesitate and waver between feelings of, "Well, I'll just leave it," to, "I can't just leave it." I decide it's too big for one person to do and so I leave it. (248 words)

I go to a hotel check in desk. I say to the male clerk, "I want to make reservations here and also at the retreat up in the mountains." He is quite frosty and says, "We have no vacancy." I say, "I wish to go to the mountain retreat first and then come back here to rest during the week." "Ah," he says. "Very well." He starts to write up my reservations. A young woman/girl comes up to me. She used to be a client and starts talking to me. I say to her, "I'm here for a rest and I really don't want to hear you right now." She doesn't like that and sighs. She sneaks in the comment that that is O.K., even if she is going to get married to her step-father, who is a really mean man, and even though she really needs to talk to me. I feel guilty and caught all at the same time. I want alone time but it's obvious she is going to talk to me. I give in. I then do some role-playing with her. I point out how she drops eye contact and turns her body away from me. She says, "Oh, that's very interesting." The clerk suggests that we crash the party and if it gets wild, he'll put his hand over his rosebud boutonniere and I'll adjust my rosebud corsage. That will mean we will meet at the car. I ask him to show me the gesture so I'll recognize the signal. He does it. I see his hand is brown, small and pudgy, child like. I repeat the instructions and hope I don't forget. We go to the party. I'm wearing a long formal gown and I have one high heeled shoe on and one off. I walk on tiptoes with the right foot and hope no one notices my missing shoe. There is a buffet table. Lots of high class snotty women. I'm dishing up food into my plate. A tooth with a feather on it falls out of my mouth onto the table. I am embarrassed. I say nonchalantly, "Oh, pardon," very French-like and classy. I pick it up. It reminds me of an engagement ring. I feel the empty place with my tongue. I realize there had been another one that fell out sometime earlier. (392 words)

It's somebody's wedding. I'm going to sing a duet with the bride because she's nervous and doesn't want to do it alone. There's a crowd like at a movie theatre. I go out to get a cup of coffee. As I'm going back in, I hear her singing the duet alone. I remember the word "Jean." It's her name. I feel badly and I try to get there for her. The crowd gets in the way. I realize that she's doing O.K. (82 words)

I'm on land, near a large body of water, the ocean I think. We are abandoning the land. Each of us (family), I think dive into the water. A man and I are in a capsule that protects us from the pressure and gives oxygen so we can breathe. The man is from the depths of the water. I am a little afraid, but feel safe with the man. We go many miles to the very depth of this vast ocean. I see the color red and then it would go away. There is a city of structures down there. I note that it's easy to be down there because it's not crowded. My "father" tells me to wear a pretty blue dress. He doesn't really tell me so much as we both agree that I should look pretty and sexy to help the man. I then sit on the man's lap. The man sees my dress and puts his finger where a gap is between buttons near my breast. My "father" says, "Oh, is he spoiling it all?," meaning we had planned that to look sexy and he's sort of looking at it objectively, like it's an error. I watch the man's face and feel comfort and I say, "No, it's all right." Then I see a girl. She has mime make-up on. She comes near us and says, "Well, where's the middle-aged man I'm supposed to recreate the joys of sex with?" The man hears and I'm embarrassed. I tell her to go away. I can handle this myself. I look at the man. I hope he's not offended at our crude way of trying to help him. He is startled and then pleased. I feel he is attracted to me. Suddenly he looks concerned. He looks around. I feel danger. A woman "sister" and several other persons are near by. He says firmly, "Everyone get back into the 'ship' at once. If you don't come at once, you'll be dead." Something has set a device to blow up. The sister turns to pull a switch. It is to be the last little "straightening up" or finishing of her work and then she'll join us, but she gets a look of confusion and terror on her face because now she has to finish a sequence. She can't let go and it will be too late. She smiles weakly and tells us to go on. I don't want to abandon her. I encourage her and the others to drop what they are doing at once. One other does. She can't. She's trapped in this sequence. We get in the ship and back away from danger. (446 words)

I'm a prisoner. I'm chained in a line with others. Our chains are a large slice of whole wheat bread. We are encased in it and have to eat a hole out of it to breathe and see where we're going. Together we all make up a loaf of bread. We walk around. I can only see a little bit so I have to be very quick and good at staying on my feet and moving around obstacles. If I fall, then I'll just be dragged around by the others, most painful. The British guard sees how well I'm doing. He calls me "Andrew" and puts me at the head of the line. I am challenged and want to show how good I am at this. I call out orders to the others and in precision, we go up and down stairs and duck obstacles. Later, I'm walking in a park (free of bread). I see Sylvester the Cat. I call to him. He is nervous. He comes over to be petted and then goes on his way. I walk on. I look for a bathroom. I find one. The door isn't there so I get a poster, and write a message to Howard and tape it to cover the door area. I see raspberries and packages of perfume in the toilet. I look at the package. It's a pretty, naked woman with long flowing hair and flowers coming out of her navel. I look across the street. I see "Liberace" and call him "Finn" I say, "Hey, are these yours?" He says, "They are." He's working in a store and makes pies. He has a pot belly and steals these things and hides them. He tells me that he must have loved his first wife because he married her.

I'm in a house, getting ready to go home. Howard is there. He wants to kiss me and go home with me. I want to be nice to him but I don't want him back. If I'm nice to him, he'll move right in. I feel trapped. Then, Curtis of Nighthawks comes in. He doesn't pay a lot of attention to me. He stands near me. I say, "I know you." He says, "I don't know you." I say, "Of course. I like your music." "Ya?," he says. "Did you buy my album?" I say, "No, not yet," and explain why not. He starts to dance. It's very complicated. I recognize it as a dance I saw on T.V. and join in. He's very pleased and impressed that I can do it. We dance. We draw closer. I am sexually attracted to him and I'm feeling anger. He responds to me. I draw him toward the bedroom. He stops and says, "I want to make love, but not now, not here. Let's wait a few days." I get angrier. He's just trying to reject me. He doesn't really like me. I walk away and try to sneak out so he'll miss me and never know where to find me. He runs after me and apologizes. He gives me reasons why he wanted to wait that are logical (no contraceptives, wants it to be nicer place, etc.), and says he's sorry he should have let me know that he liked me. He just doesn't know how to express it very well. I forgive him. It's hard to wait. (267 words)

I'm in a swimming pool. Ginny and I are swimming. I stay near the edge. People keep getting in my way. They cling to the edge too and once I had to swim around them. As get to the shallow end, I walk, limping. I notice they have removed all the water from the pool. Also I see a bunch of older people walk by. They are being led to the children's wading pool. One old guy's bare butt shows like he is wearing a hospital gown. The water is all gone because they clean it and return it at half-time. The water starts to come back in. As it does, a cage or screening drops over the pool and we are turned full circles. At the point where I'm upside down, with the water rolling in over me, is very frightening. It's akin to carnival rides. It happens several times. Then it's swim time again. A boy comes to me, holding a soggy pair of ear muffs he has found in the pool. He is deaf. I tell him to take it to the lifeguard. At first I shout, forming my words carefully. Then I try finger spelling. He takes them to his mom, also deaf. She takes them to her husband (a counselor at a conference I met and also a friend of Rachel's, an ex-priest, now married). He is deaf also. I painstakingly finger spell, wishing I had learned sign language because it must be frustrating for him to have to converse so slowly. He holds the ear muffs up to the crowd and tries to speak. He has a voice, but he sounds deaf. Everyone in the pool shuts up and is embarrassed. I intervene and scold them for being insensitive and fearful and ignorant about disabilities. I then can't remember the sign for "B." I ask someone, Ginny or Bonnie. He then signs, "We'll do the alphabet together so we know we're using the same signs." His hand is small and his fingers are also deformed; nonetheless, we both can make the signs. Then a girl in my class leaves the pool. Her boyfriend is harassing her. I follow and intervene. The boyfriend (Rosemary's Cory), is being very obnoxious and verbally threatening. I tell him to leave. (382 words)

I'm building a fire in a fireplace. The floor in the living room is a mess, wood, sawdust, papers, etc. I put it in the fireplace. I get a fire going. It's snowing outside. I'm proud that I got the fire going when no one's around to rescue me if I blow it. Smoke comes out into the room. I fix that. The fire starts to die out. I pull several old logs from previous fires. They still have coals, red hot, and help get this fire burning. I notice it's nearing 8 o'clock. I'm supposed to be back at work for the evening shift. I don't want to leave. I excuse myself because it's snowing. I feel like I'm playing hookey. I go out for more wood. My bathroom is in another building. It's a long walk. (138 words)

I'm in my house, only it's M City or someplace isolated. It's late at night and I'm alone. I lock all the doors. I put the cats out. I have a feeling of deep foreboding. I feel afraid. I get to my bedroom, and step outside to look. There is an airport across the way, a county airport. I see a plane coming in for a landing. It crashes into something or explodes. I feel sick because I am witnessing an awful thing. I see it explode and I see the flames. I say, "Oh no!" It crashes into places and buildings and people on the airport ground. I run into my bedroom. Now I'm asleep in my bed feeling the fear of what I had witnessed. I'm trying to wake up. I have to wake up because the awfulness of the crash has affected the girls/women at the airport. They are coming to my house. I try to turn on the light on my bed. It won't go on. I feel this is sinister. I grope for a flashlight. It rolls and nearly falls off the headboard. I catch it just as it almost falls. I am so afraid it's a terror, a nightmare. I turn it on. A weak light shines. I try to get up and I fall out of bed. I know something is very wrong. I get back in bed. I get out of bed. I look out the window. I must call the police. I get the phone. It's a wall phone. It's dead. I look and the women are swarming all around me, like zombies or crazies. They moan and cry out, "Don't let the police catch you." A policeman comes to the door. He picks me up to take me over to the airport. I am paralyzed with fear. I don't know who to trust. Then I hit out at the policeman. I knock his head off. It doesn't matter. He's carrying me away. Then I'm trying to wake up and write the dream down. I see myself writing the dream down (It was hard to wake up. It's an awful feeling). (360 words)

I'm in bed with Gordon (co-worker). We are lying there, clothed, talking about clients and work. I look out the window and see a boy who is turning in to a duck. He is growing soft white down on his chest. I am intrigued by this boy. He's been abandoned. I reach out and touch the downy softness. I ask him to come into the house. We'll examine him and take care of him. A couple of VR counselors come in. One is Paul Simon. I am attracted to him and vice versa. I am now on the periphery of the group. I go outside and sit down. Paul comes out with 3 copies of the VR class report on the boy. I start to read it. A tall guy, a friend of Paul's comes over. He's my boyfriend. He sits near me. Paul goes in the house and sits in the upstairs window and looks longingly down at me. I look longingly up at him. We silently agree to go away. The tall guy leaves for a minute. Paul and I sneak off. Wherever we go, this tall guy appears. We even go to different time periods. In one time period, I complain about the locked in lot of women. The tall guy appears as a boxer. I keep wanting to read the case report. Paul decides to take me home to his house. We have to sneak in because his parents would misunderstand and think we just wanted to go to bed. Paul leaves me at the front door and sneaks around to the back. The father comes out and finds a baby at the door step. I am in full view but he doesn't see me. I'm lying on my back, hiding. The father pulls some clothes, adult women size, out of a hamper for the baby. He then massages the mother's neck to placate her. He's taking care of her so she won't throw the baby out. (331 words)

Mabel comes over to my house. She's going out on a date the next night and wants to borrow a blouse or a sweater as I always have nice things to wear. She wants to look special. I look around in my closet and find pretty, white, soft, translucent blouses. She tries them on. She can't decide which one. I find her a blue skirt. Then she tries on a pair of shorts and a pink blouse with a bow at the neck. I say, "Oh, you aren't going to wear that are you?" Then I find her a pretty blue dress. We both agree that it will look very nice. (111 words)

Howard comes back. We get married again. I can't figure out why I did it. It feels wrong. Howard and I are going to the coast for our honeymoon. He says, "We'll talk." He says he's a very unhappy man, 13 unhappy marriages. First to me, then to Karen, and then to me again. He tries to commit suicide in the ocean. He comes back. He wants us to go down to the ocean and play. I say, "No, let's sit on the sand right here and talk." He keeps pulling away and wanting to go do something. I say, "Wait. I'm feeling really frustrated. This is what happened before. You won't open up. I just want to feel close. I want to feel emotion. You feel so cold and distant." Then I say, "Ya, I know. I do it too. I'm afraid, but let's try this time." He can't. I feel sad and relieved. (155 words)

I'm driving a friend down Centennial Loop. I'm describing the way so she'll know how to get around on her own. We pay over several bridges. They are monuments to Elvis Presley of Memphis. I see a blue and white 55 Chevy convertible in perfect shape. Then we're walking across the bridge. There are thousands of scrapbooks with interesting stories in them, stories of women who had stirring psychic events. I then stop reading them. I say, "I don't believe it. If it had happened to so many, then I would have felt it too." I then see my mother. She is flying. She does a dance on the top of a street light. I then decide to fly too. I do so. I go up to her. We're up at the height of the telephone wires. I say to her, "Let's go higher." She says, "Ha! This is hard work, just to get this high." I worry about suddenly losing the power to fly if I go higher, then it will really hurt if I fall. I see a line of people like in a carnival stage. We go closer to see. The women are mostly naked. One person is invisible. We go closer and discover that it is a man, fully dressed in a brown suit and tie. The reason no one can see him is because of a light that goes on and off behind him. He comes over to us and says, "Fix the food." We ask, "What kind of food?" He says, "You know the usual, African food." My mother and I grow pretty white wings and fly across the street. With the wings, I feel secure now and not afraid of falling. I am delighted at their beauty and how cleverly they tuck in when they're not in use, so no one sees them. I fly up to a guy and ask him where the food is so we can prepare a meal. His eyes widen as he sees my wings. I'm fluttering them effortlessly to maintain my stillness in mid-air. My mother and I start to set the table, in mid-air. (358 words)

I'm packing to go to M City to visit my parents. I have things in 3 different places so it's all confusing to me. I have stuff at my school dorm room, at the house in M City (remodeled), and at a third place. Ginny drives me from place to place. I'm trying to remember all the important things like my book that I'm writing, some clothes, and my toothbrush. When I'm at the M City house, I see it's all changed. The bathroom's been moved up stairs and the stairs are hard to walk up. Ginny helps me. I get up there. Jake, with a bald head but young, is standing in the shower part of the bathroom. He's angry. I think he's been sent there as a punishment. I ask him to leave for a minute. I try to sit on the toilet, but a potty trainer device is on it and it's very uncomfortable. I admire the size of the room and its new pink color. I then go get in my beat up red pickup truck (like Dwight's), and drive to the dorm to get my toothbrush. I look in the mail box and wonder why I don't get as much mail as I used to as a teenager. I think, "It's getting late and dark, and it's a long drive and I still have to stop somewhere to get a hamburger." I suggest to Ginny (mom) that we drive caravan, but she wants to go on because I'm taking too long. I feel frustrated and inept. She commiserates with me. It's because of the remodeling that I can't easily find the things I want to take with me. Then, I'm looking at a tennis match. I think, "I can play tennis." I get out there and miss a serve and make another mistake. The officials then look at the ball. It's been doctored so it's an unfair match. The officials call the game and bring this information to everyone's attention. The women's team is upset and angry. Someone says, "Rematch, only with a fair ball." I take the challenge. I go to the official and say, "Give me a good ball." She says, "Do you want a standard one, or will you make your own?" I decide to make my own. I shape it out of pink gooey stuff. 4 big guys are on the men's side waiting. I feel tense and sure of myself. Then, as I make the ball, I feel unsure and scared. I decide not to chance making my own. I say, "Give me a good standard ball, then there's no question about its weight." I then see an "instant" replay of the decision about the unfair ball. As I watch, a man with a camera comes close up to my face. I feel like crying because of the injustice of an unfair ball. As the tears start to flow, he starts to take a picture. He's encouraging me to cry. "Come on honey, that's it." I feel exploited and turn to him, with an angry face and yell, "Just what do you think you're doing?!" I then go out on the court and take the 4 men on one at a time. I'm good. I beat them. They are very surprised (I wake up because I hear an odd voice in my mind saying, "Knock, knock, knock, knock." I thought someone was in the room or outside my door until I woke up). (583 words)

I'm driving and I keep taking the wrong turns. At first, I end up on a dirt road beside the highway, on the right. I come to a stop and realize I have to back up. I tell the female passenger to watch on the right side so I don't go over the edge into the river. I watch the left side so I don't hit a 3' wall. She turns to me and says, "I think you'd better watch this side. I don't want us to go off into the river." I kind of look at her like, "Woo, what a slow brain." I back up, and get back on the highway. Then I take a left side road and I'm really frustrated now. All this is taking time and I just want to get on with my journey. I pound my steering wheel and say, "Damn it!" We are on a one way narrow road that spirals down and down and down. I am aware that if I had been quick enough just before the spiral started, I could have taken a left road that would have got me back on the highway easier. I feel like it's "one of those days," nothing goes right. We end up in a room. An older woman, the captain of a ferry boat, comes over. I ask her how to get back up to the highway. She says, "The only way to do that is to take my ferry and it will cost." There are 3 ferry rides between here and central (state). I realize we are far below the highway, perhaps deep in the river already. I see it rushing past and wonder how you start a ferry ride when you're under water to start with. I think, "This woman is just trying to get money out of me." I ask her, "Well, how do you get back on the highway? Do you go clear to central (state) first and turn and go back?" She smiles and says, "No, I take route XXX." I look on my map, figuring I'll take that route. I can't find it, so I give up and pay for the ferry ride. (367 words)

I am directing, acting in a play. It's at a conference and the parents are the audience. I'm a teacher and the rest of the actors are students. I don't know my lines. Other actors come 10 minutes late and miss their scenes. I keep whispering asides to the other actors. I feel really embarrassed. At one point, I walk out and say, "Well, since we're waiting for one of the actresses to show up, we'll get on with the conference. The parents applaud that idea. They are obviously bored with us. Then I'm off-stage. A dog is trying to get a can/bottle opener out of my purse and I fight him and make him leave. Then the rest of the cast shows up and rather than disappoint them, we continue with the show. The parents, a few of them seated way in the back, are bored. My back is to the audience. I can't remember lines. At one point, I'm adlibbing and I ask, "So you're going on vacation, eh?" The girl looks at me agonizingly and says, "I don't know." So I continued, "Where are you going and how?" She gulps, pauses, and says, "I'd rather not talk about it now." We just drop the rest of that scene. By now, the parents are stirring, talking, and showing each other pictures of their children (in the play). An exercising class comes on stage and uses the left half of the stage. Then the next scene begins. I see cute decorations for scenery and feel proud of my students. I comment an aside to one that I didn't even give directions for scenery and yet they did such a good job, on their own. I think we're doing a murder mystery. A "policeman," my cousin Lenny sits on my right. I am an "old woman," Vera. Lots of people come to the table. I'm reading my prop book to find the lines I can't remember. I have to share it with the "policeman." Ginny/Lydia on my left helps me look for lines. I see an article for tropical poisonous fish. It is an awful experience. I just want it to end. The parents start applauding. They had seen actors coming into the scene and they thought it was curtain call, or hoped it was, anyway! (386 words)

I'm asleep on my tummy in a one room apartment. It's night. Ginny comes in and she's just arrived from San Francisco. She lays down on top of me and hugs me. I'm really glad she's back. I am aware of tenderness and sexual excitement. She slides her arms around my breasts. I feel repelled and then decide I want her. I turn. She takes her clothes off. I lay on top of her and feel exquisite tenderness, love and sexual desire. We caress and kiss one another. I am making love to her. I want her to feel good. Her enjoyment heightens my enjoyment. It's all in the first tentative stages, desire and need are strong, and then something stops it, or it just stops and I'm feeling the cats jump on the bed and curling up to sleep. I sense her 2 boys in the background somewhere (I wake up amazed at how real all of that felt). (160 words)

I'm with Aunt Naomi and Uncle Gus. There's a volcano going to erupt. Uncle Gus wants to go see it, but I don't. I feel scared. There are children, half grown, and several boys who have grown beards. One has a girl with him. He says, "I never knew what anything meant until I met her, and now I'm alive." We're high on a mountain peak. Uncle Gus takes us down to the flat lands. He shows us a fancy yacht he gets to drive. I look closely. I say, "Oh, isn't it on fire? Are those flames coming out of it?" Uncle Gus runs to look. My "dad" is watching the flames. Uncle Gus is sad now. Then I feel the volcano starting to erupt. I run back toward the mountain peak house, calling for my daughters to hurry. I find Dovre and Paulina, but Ellie is in the shower being stubborn, unaware of the danger. I call insistently. She comes out. We run and run. Then the "children" are climbing up a cathedral-like thing and the statues of angels and Mary break in the earthquake and fall and kill some of the children. My daughter is safe. A little boy is not. He dies. I sorrowfully pick up a little angel statue and cry out at the awfulness of the children dying by these statues. A jeep pulls up. 2 men are in it. One is a bearded "son" and his friend. They are drunk. I tell the friend. He doesn't want to believe the boy died. He asks, "But there were 2 groups of children, he was in the group that was safe, eh?" I sadly said, "No." The bearded man cried out in anguish and sorrow. With no child, there is no reason to live. He rails against the religious figures that killed his son. (309 words)

I'm at Aunt Elaine's house. I am getting married to her son Terence. The problem is somehow we're alike. He has a rack of clothes just like mine, dresses, bra, etc. They are actually prettier than mine. I knock some off the rack as I walk by. I'm embarrassed and pick them up. He's at the table already. It's a party to celebrate our forthcoming marriage. I feel very unsure and keep saying, "You don't want to do this. Let's call it off." Terence assures me that he will be fine and care for me properly when we're married. I'm given a glass of milk. I see a crack in the glass. I fiddle with it and it breaks; the whole glass shatters into square pieces. The milk spills out and is soaked up into the table cloth. My "dad" seated on my left frowns. My "mom" seated across from me, next to Terence, looks surprised. I leave the table to get a replacement. I go to the kitchen with Aunt Elaine. I see her kitchen curtains. They are like mine, so I wonder if that's where I got them. I'm writing in my appointment book. Someone named KLU is written 3 times in the afternoon for lunch. She's coming from back east. Someone else wants to make an appointment at that time. I start to erase KLU. Someone says "No," and I write O.K. on another day. I feel uncomfortable marrying Terence, because somehow "we are the same" and I'm concerned that he doesn't care about me. (258 words)

I'm at the top of a waterfall or a rush of turbulent water. As I'm careening down, the water becomes a freeway, crowded with other cars. I'm out of control and I can only hope that as I merge into oncoming traffic, I don't hit anybody. I do manage by luck, not skill, to merge successfully. I am in the left hand lane (the fast lane). I must get over to the right lane to make an exit. I barely manage to do that. As I start to make a right turn to get on the road I think I want, I find myself being pulled backwards down another road that goes to the left. It's like a track (like in a Walt Disney fun ride), has hooked onto my van. I'm being taken for a ride. I have no control. I'm sitting behind the driver's seat; the van is going backwards and I can't see clearly where we're going. I'm alone and concerned that our van will crash into something. As I realize that I'm in a truck, I semi-relax, put my feet up and lean back. I watch traffic the van narrowly misses. The van is going fast. I get where I'm going and now I'm in my wheelchair. I'm going to visit Rhonda's acting class. It's a reunion now that I've made it big in Hollywood. I see Ronnie (a student). She says, "Oh! It's you. How are you?" I'm somebody important now.

I'm in a small school auditorium or cafeteria. We are all looking for pictures for when my mother was 5 or 6 years old. My father points to a picture of when I'm (looks like Lydia), a baby and says, "Maybe keep that one because you look like her." I see another picture, a "graduation" picture. A crowd of people are in a semi-circle. I see myself, right in the center of the curve. I'm wearing a blazer jacket, shorts or a short skirt and furry knee boots. I note that my legs are pretty good looking. I see a man near me that I feel warm about. I look at the legs of another girl. Her legs are skinny with large knobby knees. I think, "Oh, how could she wear a short skirt. Isn't she embarrassed?" Then I look at a letter written by high school boyfriend Nate, only the name "Julian" is on the envelope. I decide not to read it because I didn't like him. Up on the stage, are puppets, little dogs, and one is playing the drums. There is a scrap book that is fur lined. I feel it. It's very soft and nice. The room is crowded. I'm laying on top of a round table. "Dad" is somewhere near. A guy comes in. I wave my book at him and say, "Come join us." He says, "No, I'm Mark, the Home Ec. teacher, and I came in here to tell you that our class starts in a few minutes. I'm going to be a hard nose about it and insist you leave." I say, "Well, I'm here for a math class. We started at noon." People start leaving. He looks at the book in my hand and says, "Oh! Dreams. Not me! They are too intelligent!" I say, "Because they tell you so much about yourself?" He says, "Too much!" I shrug my shoulders. He's not got the right attitude. I want to learn everything. I see a book in his hand. It has a picture of a building. I say, "Oh! I've been there. I've seen that building. Where is it?" It is white, stone and ornate, with many carved 'gargoyles' and lions on it, iron ornate fences, etc., one story long. A woman looks at it and asks what the book is about. He says, "Architecture." I think the building is in another state. He says, "It's an agriculture building." He then says, "It's written by a rheumatoid. I say, "Ya, a lot of them write books. I'm going to, too." I go to a shelf of books like in a library and look at them. (444 words)

I'm a "soda jerk." Lots of people are crowded in. They are all singing because the boss, a good-looking young man is. I mouth the words because he is watching, and then I just stop. I don't want to sing, even if I lose my job. A plump man comes to my left and asks me to please tell him what the 4th of July is like. He looks at me like, "Don't laugh, I'm serious." I feel like laughing, after all, everyone knows what 4th of July is like. Then I think, "Maybe he's a foreigner or something." I glance over at my boss who's watching and take the time from my job to explain to him. "It's when families get together and go off to parks or camping. Some fish, some hike, and some hunt. Then I remember, "Oh, lots of food and other families go to the city park and watch fireworks." I realize that I should have told him that first because that's the more American traditional way. My boss stands by me and indicates I should be working. (183 words)

I'm in a department store, looking for the cigarettes, a carton of Salems. The store has been remodeled. I can't find them. I am holding a carton of cigs, the carton is bright red and the cigs are not Salems, so I keep looking. I see a display case with "novelty" cigs; they are Salems. One jar is full of fat candy cigarettes with chocolate tips. Another has cigars, fat, with a "fringe" on it. I decide to take the candy cigs because the regular ones can't be found and they are better than nothing. Then Ginny brings me some of hers, the real kind. (105 words)

Two high school girls are walking back to their pickup truck. It's at night, so the girls are worried. I'm one of the girls. As we near the truck, I feel a sense of foreboding. Men are near by and they will rape us if they get their hands on us. As we get near the truck, I show my girlfriend and say, "Run!" I'm fumbling for my keys. She's ahead of me so I shove her and yell, "Lock the door, quickly." She is incredibly slow. Two men are in the pickup bed coming for the door. I scramble over her and reach for the back button. Just as I hit the button, the man in a red cap grabs the door handle. It's a tussle. I'm nearly paralyzed with fear. I get the door locked and now I have to roll up the window. I barely get it closed. They're trying to force the door open. I turn on the ignition and gun the motor. I try to shake them off. They hang on and get into the pickup bed. I careen around the streets to shake them off. I suddenly stop because there's a fallen tree across the road, with its branches strewn around. I back up and turn around. I finally get rid of the rapists but I must hurry back home to safety. Now the roads are snowy. The pickup truck is now a tape recorder we're pushing up the hill. Other cars are in our way. One skids out of control. I have to gun the motor and try to get around. I feel my friend gasp and say, "Oh! Be careful." I make it, and then I'm aware that to gun my motor too much will be hazardous, and I'll spin my wheels to no avail. With tricky driving, I am making it up the hill. Sometime I reach out to a clothes rack full of clothes on the right side of the road to pull myself along. Then I'm in a "boxcar" thinking and I'm talking to a "brother." One of us has to go out there and get to safety. Now I'm the brother and my sister tells me to go out there. I say sarcastically, "Thanks a lot!" She tells me why it's me that should go out there; it's something about protecting her. (394 words)

I'm at a dressing table. Kotex pads are strewn around. There is menstrual blood on the sleeves of my robe. I try to cover it with my hand. I clean up my dressing table/desk. Co-workers Josh and Pat, and other counselors come in. Someone puts music on. They dance. I get up and say, "Very interesting. I can do that. Let me show you." I scurry them off. The music is slow and sad. I dance by using my arms to gesture and by not moving my feet very much. I do, however, manage a toe stand once or twice. It's a very sad and moving dance. After, I go sit down in an easy chair. I see a big box with lots of birds flying around in it. I notice it has nothing on the front to keep the birds in. At first, the birds stay in, and then the baby quail scurries out. A big owl is standing near by and starts to dive for the baby quail. I jump up and yell. A cat goes for the baby quail. I push it away. Several of the women counselors come over and complement me on my dance. Then a man comes behind me as I'm sitting in this high backed winged chair. He has mistaken me for his wife. He calls me by her name. He wants me to come home. I tell him that he's mistaken. He won't believe me. I tell him to be careful of the swordfish that's on top of the box with the birds. I notice it has no sword and I wonder if I've misnamed it. He ignores the diversion and pursues me. He's middle-aged and pudgy. I keep pushing him away. He hugs me and pleads. I am aware that Pat is upstairs. She played the music for my dance. (309 words)

A royal family. Something about a separation at a young age, many travels through different lands. Holland is represented by wooden shoe-shaped pick up beds that held tulips. I searched for the prince. I looked in a movie house. I saw him and hid behind a curtain. I thought I was the one they tried to kill. Then I crossed a border and found the two I'd been separated from since they were babies. Even though they were grown now, I held one and cooed it as if he were a baby. He was embarrassed but tolerated it. (98 words)

He says, "Don't worry, when she's left, we'll have a good time." She watches us. As we near the house where the party is, I hear talk about a boy that deliberately does things improperly to get attention. He's always getting in trouble. I think, "Oh, he'll grow up." I see people arriving for the party, uni house kids. They have presents and food. I am empty-handed. I feel embarrassed for that and also because I'm older than they and so I feel out of place.

A man like Raul is going to be in a play, he and his friend. Ginny and I are in the audience. We're dating the men. Ginny leaves the room for a moment. I sit in something like a church pew. 2 older women, loud talkers and criticizers, sit next to me and behind me. I am embarrassed. I tell them, "Hey, these kids are doing the best they can." The play has a large cast and I'm in the very front row. The play happens in front of me and off to my right. The chorus line is dancing with huge oxygen tanks. Then the play is over. I'm sitting in grandma Agnes' living room. It's like a reception for the cast. Ginny has come back just at the ending of the play and she has squeezed in between me and the noisy lady. The lady is annoyed but I point out to her that it was our bench first. Raul comes out and sits on a couch next to me. We talk about the play. I look out an open window and see a multi-colored baby flamingo bird sneaking in. I say, "Oh! So that is a flamingo?" Raul looks and says, "Oh ya, I guess so." He's not too interested. I encourage it to come in. There are 2. They both come in and I shut the window before they can escape. My mother has been waiting a long time. She'll be happy. I tell my father, "Hey, the flamingos are here." He says, "Oh, let them go, she hasn't got the bookcases that were going to go with it." I say, "No! She really wants this. She can arrange them differently if something isn't here." He shrugs his shoulders. Then Andrea comes up all aglow and says, "Barb, thanks so much for the card," and goes on to thank others for their gifts. I shrug it off; it doesn't matter. I feel glad that she thanked me but embarrassed that it is only a card. (339 words)

A man gets out of prison. He's walking around and he sees me. I am longingly looking at a motorcycle. It's a creamy brown color. He walks up to me and says, "Oh ya?" meaning little ol' you is interested in riding this powerful motorcycle? I just smile and walk away. He says, "You wait over there. I'll get you a motorcycle." I sit on a couch across the ornate hotel lobby room from a huge log fire. The flames are white. There is a small log fire with white flames on the couch next to me. I warm myself on it. I am tired, so I nod off for awhile as he goes to get me a motorcycle. A man comes by and puts a note in my hand. I am aware of it, even though I'm asleep. A couple loom large on my left, watching and then they leave. The man with a motorcycle comes. I am pleased and happy. I get on the seat behind him. I ask him where I should sit and, "How do I place my feet so I'll be safe?" He instructs me. I put my arms around him and lay my hands on the handle bars with his. He removes my hands and puts them on his chest. I think that makes sense; it could be dangerous with both of us in control. I think, "Later, I'll sit in front and drive and he can ride." I enjoy the sensual pleasure of curling around him as we ride along. It's like I "have to" put my arms around him for my safety, not that I'm putting my arms around him for pleasure and therefore I could enjoy the pleasure. (287 words)

I'm in a class. Ethan is the teacher. In order to pass, I have to learn to shoot a rifle, drink Section 8 juice and jog. I'm back in M City. There's a male bully that challenges me. I get a new angle for my left angle, RA leaves, I jog to build up muscle tone. The Section 8 juice is light cider with a couple teaspoons of Section 9, which is hard cider. I practice hard. At the last day of class, I shoot a perfect bull's eye with a pump rifle and then with a 30-30. I drink twice as much Section 8 as anyone else. Everyone is amazed at my prowess. I'm proud. I wake up with the words "And the light follows." Oh, I just remembered that as I was practicing jogging, I ran past the old house in M City. It had been removed so that there was space and light for a small, cute, cozy apartment for an old lady. As I ran by, I peeked in the windows. There was no kitchen, because someone else did her cooking. I saw a pretty Afghan, multi-colored, and a rocking chair, a single bed, with lots of lovely windows. I thought, "Well, when she dies, they can put in a kitchen so the unit will be reusable." [BL] (221 words)

I'm going to go see cousin Terence. He's on the sixth floor. I pass a bed that's outside. It's raining. Willie and Dan bring a bedspread to cover their blankets when it rains. I ask them, "Is the bedspread waterproof so the blankets won't get mildew?" They don't really answer us and I pat it to see. It's raining heavily. It's a blue wool Indian blanket. I go in the house and look for the elevator. There are two. A man falls out of the one on the right. He'd gotten sick in there, so I get into the one on the left. I look for the button for 6th floor. I don't see it. I call out to 2 men and ask them to help me. I say, "Could you do it? My hands are very weak." They look at each other like, "Oh no! A pigeon!" I get nervous. One gets in my elevator and stands to my left. The other gets in the other elevator which is open to mine now. I know they are going to hurt me because I said I'm weak. I see a pile of crutches and canes. I push #6 button and run over and pick up my cane. As they lunge for me, I fight them off with my cane. I escape out of the elevator but it's only for the second floor. It takes courage but I get back on the elevator because it's too much pain/energy to walk up the stairs. The men are gone. I get to the 6th floor. Terence and his bride are off in their bedroom sleeping, on an extended honeymoon. A "hippie" guy comes to the door and asks to speak to Terence. I tell him, "Terence is unavailable because he's on his honeymoon." The guy is quite upset. I call Terence. Terence comes out, walks over to him, and says, "Listen, you little fucker, leave me alone. I don't like you." Other relatives are shocked that he talks this way. I am wearing a bride's dress and veil. I raise my eyebrow and speak in a clear voice. Everyone is impressed with me. They know I'm angry and Terence's going to get in trouble. I walk up to Terence and say, "Would you be kind enough to step into the library for a moment?" He does so. It's like a dad calling his son on the carpet. I put my hands behind my back and pace back and forth and lecture him. "You will never, I said never, call anyone a 'fucker' again. You will be honest and polite." I then role-play with him on how to tell the guy that he doesn't like him and how to ask for him to go away assertively. He listens gravely and practices his role-play. (469 words)

I'm in N City visiting Aunt Elaine's. We go through town. I am getting married, or have a boyfriend. We find a boyfriend for my younger "sister." We go "home." "Mom and dad" are leaving on a trip, leaving the house to my sister and me. I open a drawer to get something for them and a small hidden drawer falls out. It's very old. I look in it. I see a spider. I quickly take the drawer to a sink and turn on the water to drown the spider. It changes into a miniature man. I am still trying to drown it. I almost succeed. He looks quite blue. I try to swish him. He avoids me and rolls on a log. I stop trying to kill him. I say to him, "This is 1981." I say the # slowly because I want to trick him into showing surprise if he is very old. He does. I expect him to tell me he's 1800's, but he says somewhere in the 6th to the 10th century. He changes into a light bulb and rolls all over me like something with static electricity. He says, "You'll never get rid of the light now. I'll be with you everywhere you go." I feel pleased and also aware that it will take an understanding man to have a relationship with, he'll have to tolerate my "light." I take off a pair of fancy hose. I talking to a man named Jim, who thinks I'm great even with my light. (256 words)

I'm at a Sunday night church gathering. I'm thinking, "I haven't done this in years." It's crowded. A drunk man next to me whispers, "Reproductive organs." I good naturedly tell him to shut up. I see a big sign that says "Brothers, Jesus..." Later someone, a male, says he has to take part of my reproductive system out. I just play with my nipples and enjoy it, i.e. I have an orgasm. I look at him and say, "I can't do that. I would feel embarrassed that I would have to go to orgasm with people watching." A girl whispers, "You can do it." (104 words)

I'm in a school room like in Jr. high. I'm sitting at a desk. A man sits on my right. I am trying to sell a trumpet. It's very short and has no "slide." The man and I talk about how this one is harder to play and older than most trumpets. I don't want to give it up. I go to the door of the classroom to see if Muffin Cat is around. I come back to my desk. Someone else is sitting there, another man. I know him. I walk up behind him and massage his shoulders. Larry R is sitting to my left. He is whiny and asks my assistance. He's holding a round glass that has a "face" drawn on it, like on the Kool-aid pitcher. He wants me to place his fingers so that it is in the place where the mouth is drawn. I do so. I'm annoyed at him. I chat with the 2 men. I like them. They like me. (168 words)

I'm the captain of a ship and I have a crew, a man and a woman. We are going to display the ship. I find a place to moor it in this huge building. It used to be a stove. There is snow on the sidewalk to the indented place I have the ship. I tell my crew to remove the snow so people can walk there with ease. Then I see there's no water where I have the ship and the space is only 2 or 3 feet deep. I am concerned that the ship won't stay upright, so I order water in. It comes rushing in. Then I order the trailer with a wheel off the bottom of the ship. It goes away. I feel very buoyed up by the water. It's like riding a balloon. I'm then in consultation with 2 of my crew. One has invented a captain's chair that moves through the air at any angle with ease. He's going to demonstrate it and lecture about it. Then I see some cats. I greet them affectionately. They are mine. I had been around when they were born. I then see 3 black and white half-grown cats. I call them to me. I want to get to know them because I had been gone when they were born. We start to make friends but they are shy. A robust older man, who reminds me of the St. Bernard, comes over. He's worked out a captain's chair also. He shows me his plans. He has an ornate set of directions with it, like a crossword puzzle combined with a jigsaw puzzle. He sees the black and white cats and greets them lovingly. He calls them "my darlings." He says, "Have you met them yet?" I say, "I'm in the process of meeting them." I feel a little jealous of his good relationship with them. He is interested in the fact that my crew has also invented a chair. I call my crew member over. He's obstinate, proud, and only partially clothed. He displays the chair like he's a male model, somewhat cold. Then I decide the chair has some "bugs" in the design and needs working on. I then am discussing the use of balloons as condoms. I see lots of people blowing up balloons to put in the vagina. I feel nervous because I can't figure out how that would prevent pregnancy and I've told people that the balloon works. I then realize that the balloon needs to be on the penis. Then I have 2 worries: l.) Balloons are not very sturdy and might break. Real condoms are made for that purpose, and 2.) The opening of a balloon is small and might be painful for the man. A man shows me a how wide the balloon opening stretches so I feel relieved about that. I realize that many people now have the balloons. I sold them to people and I'm worried that I might have given them a bad product. One woman shrugs and says, "Well, we'll know if it works in about 5 months." I feel badly because by then, it would be too late to correct anything. (535 words)

I am crying. I'm in an apartment. I am talking to my counselor. He is very sympathetic. As we talk, I feel sad because I want him to be my friend, not just my counselor. I think I'm very sad about Howard and other relationships. Anyway, the counselor (who looks like Dr. X), tells me he's married. Then he shows me pictures of some friends of his. Blake is one. I exclaim, "Oh! I know him." Them I see a picture of Darryl. I am amazed. I ask, "Is he your friend too? I know him well. He and I were going to be married, only I married Howard." Dr. X says, "Oh! Darryl is my boss." I exclaim, "Your boss! What does he do?" "Oh," says Dr. X, "he fixes cars and he's very good. He fixes foreign cars." I am amazed and have pleasant nostalgia feelings about Darryl and I feel sad because I've lost him. Then a woman comes in. She's crying. She's Dr. X's friend. She has terminal cancer. She has come in to help me understand. She says, "It's a good thing Dr. X is single so they can be friends." It's l:30 a.m. My mother calls. She says that the doctors say Aunt Charlotte is going to have a "specific exam." "What can that mean?" She doesn't like it. I say, "Well, of course she'll have a specific exam if she's got cancer." My mother says, "Shut up," and hangs up on me. I feel badly for 2 reasons. I said the word cancer in front of this lady who is dying of it, and I was too open, non-caring and insensitive with my mother. I hurt her feelings and wasn't helpful. The woman cries. There's now another woman and a daughter, maybe 13 years old or so. Dr. X assists her to calm down. I am sitting on a cot. The woman lays down on the cot and Dr. X starts undressing her. He talks soothingly as he takes off her corset and girdle and other layers of underwear. She lays there crying slightly. The 13 year old takes off her clothes and lays down beside the woman. The girl pinches her pretty young half-grown breast. Her mom takes her hand away and says, "You did it too deep." Dr.X says, "See, it's like this." He palpates the woman's breast, looking for bumps. "I don't feel one here," he says. I see scars and wrinkles on the woman's body. I get up to leave. I want to stay but I must go home to see if my mother's alright. I still feel badly about my insensitivity. I get in the car and drive. I get lost. I'm tired and sleepy. I realize that I'm running away from the warm and sexy feelings back at the apartment. I accidentally turn onto a railroad track. A train is coming up behind me. I duck off the tracks, just in time. An older man looks at me. I say, "Guess I took the wrong turn." He shrugs. I ask, "What do you think my chances are to go back the way I came?" He said, "Late at night they don't come as often, so you might make it." Then he asks if I think my car can make it up the hilly pasture. I decide to try it, feeling unsure. I feel an urgency to get back to the apartment. I berate myself for leaving. It's just like me to run from a good thing. I go back. Dr. X is still there. I take off my clothes and get in bed with him. He says, "You left before we could explain that what we did was a demonstration of a man being a friend to a woman." I want to make love to him. He's all skinny and shivering from the cold. He looks blue or greenish and clutches the covers around him. I grab him and at first it appears that I'm trying to put his whole body in my vagina, head first. I'm saying, "Get in there." I then see that I'm trying to help him back in bed as he's slipped out. He has a comic look of dismay on his face. I feel angry. Then Dr. X leaves. I've discovered that he's not really a counselor but an excellent con artist who is good enough to be a counselor but does it for kicks. He hears crying in a room as he passes. He peeks in. A fat woman is crying. There are 4 women nearly naked. Dr. X (now looks like Peter O'Toole), looks interested in the situation. He very soothingly goes to the women and starts counseling them. As he subtly gains their confidence, he edges into the bed with them and lays his head on the pillow which is the huge bra of the fat woman. He smiles like a Cheshire cat. His arms are behind his head and one knee is crossed over the other, very relaxed and happy. The women cry out that a man had offered to make love to them and they'd just found out he was a fairy. Now they won't be able to have babies, which is why they were going to all this work of making love. He was "balling them blind" and he lied! They've been had and used. Dr. X smiles because he's got the answer and he'll love every minute of it. (914 words)

I am angry at Terence because I asked him to get something for me and he teased me. I glare at him and don't talk to him. He says, "Come over here with me." I refuse. He picks me up. He says with a grin, "You'll get over it. We're pre-ordained to be married." I am angry and say, "Not ever!" He takes me into a hall with a series of doors and we get to a room. A "recording" of some kind speaks of the future and says Terence and I will be married. I refuse to speak to Terence and he laughs because he knows that all he has to do is wait. Then someone's after us. We go into the men's room to hide. I sit up on the edge of the toilet with my feet up and head down, coiled. Terence stands, leaning over me so no one sees me. Men come in. At first, I'm worried and then I figure, "Well, I guess I haven't anything to worry about because of the future already predicted." Terence goes out. I have to wait. As I wait, a man sits in the next stall and starts chatting with me. I answer back in grunts and single syllable words in as low a voice as I can manage. At one point, I have to talk a full sentence. He looks over suspiciously. He says, "Hey, you talk like a man but you're wearing women's dress. I think fast and say, "Boy, you should have been at the party last night. I just woke up here, dressed like this!" He accepts that. Some other man is bringing a father and his son together in another stall. (287 words)

I'm a wealthy older woman. I run an adoption agency/hospital. Right off my fancy bedroom is a huge hospital ward. People come to me carrying little babies that were just born. I inspect them and decide what's to be done with them. There are lots of people that are always around me. I have a baseball team. They come over for a dinner. One player is very good-looking, young and sexy. He is also very aloof. He can have anyone he wants and he knows it. I guess he's spoiled. I am attracted to him. I watch him. He watches me. I decide to drive him home after dinner. I do so. There is sexual tension and antagonism between us. We verbally tease each other. We get to his place. There are young women there, waiting for him. I realize I'm too old for him and I hesitate. I then decide I want him and decide to risk being rejected or laughed at by him. I walk to my car. He runs after me. I say, "Leave me alone." He grabs my keys. I try to lock the doors. He pulls the locks up. Finally, I look up at him and smile and he gets into the car. I drive him to my place. We go in. A woman is laying in my bed. She's visiting someone, so the guy and I are going to find someplace else. Then a young woman that works for me is there. I watch her. She is given a new born baby to inspect. She looks it over. It looks fine. It's very pretty baby girl. She looks at the chart. She reads off things, then she sees a word, "amphetamines" or "antihistamines." I'm not sure which. She figures, "Uh oh, that's bad but maybe it's not too bad. Maybe the baby can be kept." I walk up and look at the baby and the chart. I point to the word and say, "This baby has a heart condition and can't be kept. The other woman is very sad. As I hold the baby, it starts to turn blue and distorts its body. It is dying of a heart attack. I feel pretty matter-of-fact. The other woman feels very sad. Now I am the visiting women in the bed. I'm trying to sleep and lots of people walk through. I try to ignore them. An older man walks by (he's married to the older woman/me). He looks at me in the bed, waves in a cheerful, friendly manner and says, "Hey, XXX, how's it going?" I think to myself, "Boy, that's pretty tolerant for a husband to be so friendly to a guy in his wife's bed. The husband even called him 'son' and meant that he loved him like a son." (468 words)

I'm at the house in M City. My father is having guests from India. They come and set up a "circus tent" like awnings on the lawn. I am invited to take my father's place on an elephant hunt. I laugh and say, "Elephants? Here in M City?" The Indian person says, "Oh, yes. There are some." I'm given a light-weight rifle, maybe a .22. This boisterous military-like guy flirts with me and wants me to be on his jeep. I choose not to. I get on another jeep. There is some kind of racial or cultural unrest. The white people are staring at the Indians and are quite sure they are inferior. I feel fine about the Indians and chide the white people and feel embarrassed when the Indians hear it. Now the whole thing turns into a play. I'm on stage doing a comedic dance. The story is that this man and this woman go to the Philippines to get married. On the day of their wedding, they go sunning on the beach and get a terrible sun burn, so when they dance, they move very stiltedly being careful not to touch anything. The audience laughs at our funny dance. At the end of it, we walk "nearly arm-in-arm," only not touching, down the stairs into the audience. I'm wearing a white 2 piece bathing suit. Then I quickly run back stage to change for the marriage scene. I wear a beautiful wedding dress and veil. The joke is that we're still sun burned, so it won't be much fun on the wedding night. There is an elaborate dance scene where the white people in groups would watch a "phillipine" do something (like hold a job, bake a cake, etc.) and cry out in unison the questions, "A phillippine???" I danced around trying to shut them up. One group of women were shocked that a woman "philippine" could do what she did. The next sequence, I'm standing off stage singing an intro for a guy who'll play the piano in the audience. I sing and then someone hits the piano note I should be on. I was down one key. I feel a quick flash of embarrassment but continue. The piano guy really flubs up. He forgets his words, and he's near tears. He then tries valiantly to be cool about it. I coach him from off-stage. He follows my lead. Then he asks me to come sit by him and sing for him. I go there but only sing in a whisper so he can hear the words and then can sing them. He does so. Then I'm playing the part of a villain who wraps up a paper package with a straight pin with a colored round pin head on it stuck in the package. That pin was the fuse for the bomb. When the guy shut the piano top so he could drive his "jeep" around, it would strike the pin and then blow up. I crept about obviously and the audience loved it. The piano guy isn't too happy as he is getting blown up. I realize the play is reaching its finale and I was disappointed that I'd have to take my curtain call in the unflattering guise of a spy and villain instead of the lovely bride. (555 words)

I'm walking down a school hallway. I'm talking with some student associates. I'm getting ready to teach a career planning class. I start looking for a bathroom. I can't find one. I see a person (male), in a wheelchair. He's asking for some assistance. The person he's asking is also in a wheelchair, but not as bad off. I am cheerful. I say, "Can I help?" I go over and adjust his legs on to the foot petals. I ask him if there's any thing more he needs. He's shy and seems to need something but I don't understand. I fuss about for awhile. Then I go looking for a bathroom. The way to it is blocked, so I decide to go to my class. I walk in on Jolene's class. Then I find my own class room. Everyone is working very hard and industriously. I look on the blackboard. Written up there are the daily assignments. I see a calculator-like device with finger holds like a telephone and a "letter reader" device. The front flap folds up over the letters and you can see through the slots. I compliment the class on how well they've been studying unsupervised. I apologize for being a few weeks late. They smile happily at the compliment. I sit on a table in the middle, right of the room. A voice is heard. "Sam," it said. A woman student says "Who else wants to bet it's Henry?" I am pleased that the class is so on the ball. Then a scene unfolds like a film. Black women are somehow scary, or wrongfully accused, or something. I decide to drive my VW Bus out of the class room. I'm concerned about blocking the view of the film for students but I do it anyway. I'm concerned about not making the sharp corners to get out of the room. (313 words)

I'm in an old fashioned house, thinking I need a roommate to meet expenses. My mother and a guy come in to be roommates. I remember this guy. I don't trust him. As we prepare to lie down to sleep, I keep one eye open on him. He tweaks me a couple of times. I decide to throw him out like Muffin Cat when he's bad. I put him out on a tree limb. The guy doesn't like that. I test him. "No problem, just be invisible." He's not convinced. I decide I want a washing machine. I check the basement and see 2 of them. We comment, "How nice. Now we can get all those towels done." It's time for the guy (now Bill Cosby), to go play in a basketball game. He's nervous. I tell him not to worry. "Just stay invisible." As we're driving to the gym, the guy as a joke brings me a card that indicates a general is wanted by the police because she's moving when she has a parking permit. I laugh at the joke. We get to the gym. Bill Cosby is nervous. He needs to put his head in a wooden frame that looks like a basketball holder. Some big guy has the table with the holders on it. I tell Bill to be invisible. Bill does, and then he puts his head in a holder on another table and turns and twists around. The guy, I'm near him and watching, sees the holder thump around and his eyes get wide and he's scared. I laugh at his fear of "spooks." I watch Bill go out on the floor. I try to sneak away unseen but the announcer, an older man, sees me and calls me to the microphone. I hope my mother doesn't find out. (305 words)

Blake stands facing me. There are paper clips and lights on strings between us. As Blake moves, a force pushes the metal things. I must run. I get into a black race car and drive rapidly away. I am running from Blake. He's following. I'm on a freeway that spirals and turns this way and that. I keep choosing roads that curve to the left because that takes me away from Blake. I get out into the country and find a special retreat of mine, a friend's house. I drive my car in and hide the car in a basement hall. I run up stairs to check the doors to see that they are locked. Safety pins are the locks. The house appears deserted. Old fashioned furniture, very few pieces and old lace curtains. Fallen leaves are all over the yard. I go back downstairs and check the doors and windows. A black out curtain is over the windows. I feel Blake outside. I sit very quietly. 2 other young women are there. One makes some noise that draws Blake's attention. I try to stop her. I explain that he's dangerous. (191 words)

I am weaving. I'm in the woods. One pattern is a plaid. Lots of white yarn, lots of green yarn and a few red strings of yarn are drawn through. The second pattern is more swirling and moves quickly. There's lots of green. I weave a beautiful dress. I am a witch that lives in this distant forest. A man, a prince, comes to me. I see that he is wounded. He wears a bandage around his left upper thigh. Something about the man reminds me of Howard. I give him something to drink and say, "Here, let me look to that wound." He doesn't want me to help him. I start taking the bandage off. I unwind it many times. I find a square gauze patch on the back of his leg. Then I see transparent tape running down his leg to his knee. I say, "Here, I'll take this tape off." He says, "Can't you leave me any pride?" I smile at his stubbornness. (166 words)

I apologize and say, "I thought you still had your car and would meet me here." I feel slightly guilty for not thinking more about her situation, as she got left in a bind.

I'm in an office. My typewriter and adding machine aren't working correctly. I hit a button and it compulsively, mechanically repeats itself. I take the ailing machines to be fixed. Someone says, "The adding machine is fine and the typewriter will work most of the time." Some students come in. It's the end of the term and they're late with their papers. I realize that I am too. Andrea is also. We're at a meeting to discuss the lateness of the papers and if it will be accepted. A prim and proper female supervisor presides over the meeting. As she drones on, Andrea and I whisper. Andrea says she doesn't want to be here. She's bored; she has more important things to do. I agree. The disapproving supervisor asks what was said. I blithely say, "Oh, we were just saying how we don't want to be here." She frowns and I vaguely realize that she could take that remark in a negative way; I am just being honest and open about my feelings. I shrug my shoulders. Andrea and I whisper some more. I want to talk to Andrea but I don't want any more disapproval from the supervisor. I suggest to Andrea that we talk about it at another time. She suggests Tuesday. I say, "Today?" She says, "No, next week. Isn't next week O.K.?" I had told her this week, but I agreed that next Tuesday would be fine. I say, "I'll get something to sit on." "No," she says, "I'll get one for you." I misunderstand her word, something about "tarrer." It's a foam pad to lay on at the beach, so I don't hurt. The students, one female, one male (Mark H) are in the background. The girl is looking at birds and trying to name them. Mark H says, "I've got a new place to stay now." We see it as if a movie camera is mounted on a helicopter. At first, we are impressed. There are so many lovely windows and so large, very handsome. Then at a closer look, there's tar paper where the windows are. (353 words)

I'm in my wheelchair. A male instructor comes up to me and asks if I've been to the late evening sessions behind the stage. I say, "Not yet but I've heard they are interesting." He mentions one coming up, "Issack" or something. I say, "O.K., great! I'll be there." He leaves, all smiles. I'm sitting on the left hand corner in the back of an audience waiting for the show to start. Rosemary is behind me. She has 2 women friends with her. She's being very bossy. She'd see a situation and tell people what they need to do and where they need to sit, etc. I'm embarrassed. As the show starts, she moves away from me, like she's embarrassed for me. The show is set up like a three-ring circus. We applaud when they set up drums near our side. "Oh good," I say, "now I can see. I was worried." I say, "Oh! Are those the drums? They are huge!" They're so big, the performers sit in them. Many performers come out, a huge black man, and a huge black woman with 6 breasts. The "star," a young man with dark hair says, "Now there's a woman! Hey, big mama!" I am amazed. 2 older white guys sit down to sing an old folk tune. A woman sitting on my right sings with them. They sing very softly so they can assist her to sing. She's embarrassed and can't remember all the words. I'm a little envious. I'd like to sing too but I don't know the song. The performers throw gifts out to the audience. I catch a bunch of small Hershey bars. I pass them out to others, Rosemary, my "daughter," and others. Then I catch some spearmint gum and pass them out, keeping one for myself. I've become the contact person in my area of the audience. I look in my purse and separate all my little presents into one section. I have necklace chains that have static electricity in them, little earrings, one shaped like false teeth, little costume jewelry pins, candy canes and some other stuff. A young black boy hands out an outfit for a 13 month old baby. I hold it up to my daughter. "Will it fit?" She says, "I think it will." I question it. I decide it doesn't and give it back to the boy. He says, "Hang it on the Xmas tree and someone else will want it." I feel like I'd like to keep it but that it wouldn't be fair to others. I think about having a garage sale and selling the things I don't want to keep. (443 words)

I am walking across a busy city street. A man starts talking. We enjoy talking. He comes home with me. Muffin Cat goes around releasing emotional outbursts. Cousin Willie has negotiated to work more hours so he and his wife can afford a house. At first, I don't think he's put on too much extra, but I figure up the hours and see that he'll work 10 hours more a week. 5 weeks a month. I'm now on a street corner saying goodbye to my friend. We keep saying goodbye and then not leaving. We say, "Oh, we had such a nice time, thanks." He mentions the name of a friend of his in NYC, Rizzo's. He spells his name for me. I write it down incorrectly, Terano. I get the T in the wrong place and then I spell it twice. It's all a last minute notion, to get his name. I think, "Oh. It might be a good idea after all. I might be pregnant and I need to get hold of him." Then I remember that I couldn't be pregnant, we didn't make love. Finally I say, "Goodbye," and turn and walk away. I start to cross a street. A blonde, pretty woman in a fancy silver grey car is part way into the intersection. I think about walking around her and then the light changes to green and she drives on. It's a corner in M City. I decide not to cross the street. I walk down the street. On the left is a store front. It's a cop station. I see 4 or 5 cops (male), standing around. I casually look in as I walk by and I'm stunned to see a picture of my friend as a newspaper headline, "Wallton Returns." There is a picture of him running amuck with his clothes ripped in shreds, down to the street. I feel shock and a little fear. I spent the night with him! But, he was friendly! Maybe he'll come back and be dangerous. (339 words)

I'm at an audition. There are lots of people. There are 6 or 7 professional actors/actresses on a list and a lot of "hopefuls." I'm on the list, at the top of the list. They weren't sure of my name so they spelled it Sanders, Saunders, Pepper. I came in and sat down. I am told to rate the performance of the actors/actresses. I see. I do so. One guy, I think his name is Peter (Brook or Brown, wearing glasses like XXX), does an excellent scene. As he finishes, the director says, "You have the part." There is some confusion because a woman had done an excellent scene and they mixed him up with her/or he was her or something. Anyway, he sits down behind me, grinning. I say, "That's very good." He shrugs and says, "Oh. I'm a professional actor. I get paid. I'm just doing this for fun. Maybe it's not fair to other (amateurs)." I then notice that they haven't called my name. The male director is giving instructions to the amateurs, to get into groups, to be in the group for the character you're interested in. I think about calling myself to the director's attention but decide not to. I assume that it's because I walked in on crutches. I get up and look for a group. I start to get into a big group when I hear someone call my name. It's Mabel. She and one other woman are in a group to audition for "Sally." I join them. We walk. Mabel is nervous. Then we have to go back to our original seats until we're called. I'm slightly annoyed because it's a long way to walk. Rachel's in the front row and I'm mid-way back, on opposite sides. I go back and 3 women are in my seat. They are crowded around the professional actor. I am annoyed. Peter and a woman get into a fight, verbally. I think he just tells her to leave, arrogantly. I get very angry at him and tell him off. He laughs and baits me. I'm ready to fist fight him but I don't want to. He's laughing at me, egging me on, looking superior. I'm very angry. He puts his hands over his crotch and dares me to hit it. Then he puts his hands over his nose and dares me to hit it. I see the baiting and I don't fall into the trap. I beat on him. I'm good enough to make the attention of the director. He's interested in me now. I feel strong because I didn't back down, and I didn't have to use my crutches. I was apparently eloquent. The director then starts the auditioning and I sit down. I see it's the "Sally's" turn, so I get up and walk to the front. Mabel is doing her audition. She's speaking softly. A woman assistant director says to another assistant, "Oh, she's so young and pretty and has a good, loud voice that carries. I like her!" Then it's my turn and I stand there with a script book (everyone else has it memorized). She (the woman assistant director) says, "Oh wait, why are you auditioning for this character?" I say, "Well, frankly, I've not read the play. I'm doing a cold reading and I don't know the characters. I just chose a group that looked like me and I knew Mabel. The 2 women assistant directors grimace at each other but tolerate my lack of professional preparedness. I say, "I'll read anything you suggest." They say, "Oh, read 'Art Brown and Brown Licks Cat'." I am delighted when I find the part (on Page 92, the last page), because it's a woman who thinks she's a cat. It will be a fun part to play. I begin. I speak loudly and confidently. I'm good.

Tony W wants me to help him take a test. I must hold pictures up for him and ask him questions. It's called the "XXX far-sighted test." It's going to help him with his relationship with his wife Nancy S. George wants me to help him with something too. They both want me to do it at the same time. I have to tell one of them I can't, Tony, I think. Nancy S asks about the test. When I tell her the name she says, "It's not far-sighted." I lean over to her (a little annoyed) and say, "It's far. The pictures are very simplistic and black and white. You'll be able to see them. They lack detail." Something about cheese. [BL] (122 words)

In a house. I'm still married to Howard. Lots of cats are on the front porch. They've broken a screen so they can go in and out as they wish. I think, "My what a lot of cats." Someone asks if I put their food out where they can get it. I comment that they can come in and get it any time they want. The girls come up to me and tell me Howard is dead. I say, "No he's not, he's asleep." I look out to the back yard. He's sleeping in a lawn chair. I am embarrassed that the girls said that in front of the neighbors and I am sort of hoping it's true. Then I feel badly about hoping he's dead. I think, "Why are we still in the same house? The marriage has been dead for years." Lots of things. I'm cleaning up the kitchen. A poster with the 4 basic groups of food is written on it, in my handwriting. I think about throwing it away because I know that so well, but I just can't. Somehow, I may forget and need to be reminded. I straighten out my jewelry. My wedding rings are there. (202 words)

Now I'm a mobil oil gas station owner. I'm putting gas into a tank. I realize that my numbers in my pump don't register so I can't prove how much gas I give this person. I explain the situation to the owner of the pickup and ask him how much his tank takes. He looks suspiciously at me, then says, "48 gallons." I write it up. Then I call up a special trouble shooter number 00-XXX, to report the situation. I'm in Alabama and I own a gas station, motel and swimming pool and I live on the premises. Behind my beat up greasy place is a huge empty acreage with weeds. I look it over with an eye to expansion. The pool is empty and is a mere wading pool. I change it to a different place and larger.

I had been away doing something. I come back to my house. My husband, Burt Lancaster, is entertaining guests. I try to get his attention. I want to be kissed and hugged. He's very busy. I go into the bathroom to take a bath. I sit in the tub; I have a blouse on. Muffin Cat twice leaps on the tub and goes completely underwater. I see him under there, all curled up with his eyes shut. I pull him out and pet him and laugh. I look at our guests and explain, "How strange! Cats never just jump into water! I don't understand it." The guests are rather distant and formal. I notice that the door to the living room is open and I see 5 play mice and 5 real, dead mice under a chair. I think, "Ugh!" I get out of the tub. I follow my husband into the kitchen. He's fixing something to eat. He makes a comment, something about what a good cook he's getting to be, with me gone so much. I want to hug and kiss him. I feel sexually aroused. I try to but he keeps slipping away. He's busy doing stuff. I say, "Please come here. I want to hold you." He comes over and says, "What do you want from me?" He's aroused, and he rubs his hardened penis against me, like to show me he is aroused and attracted by me and to appease my sexual appetite until the guests are gone. I feel slight resentment because I don't just want to be bumped against. I want to be held. I want him to be less distant! (278 words)

I see a puff of smoke rise and I'm aware that it is radioactive dust. I go look for cover. I'm skiing down a jump. It costs $5 each time. You have to have paired tickets. The ticket lady tells me I must have dual tickets. I have several in my purse so she lets me ski. I'm a beginner. I have to put in a diaphragm before each ski jump. I am tired of doing that and wonder why I have to do that! Some tough man, like a J.D., bothers me. I have to be tough back. He respects that. I'm very tired. I am led to his room. I lay down on a sleeping bag. I think, "This won't work, being in his room. He'll come in and disturb me." I am really tired. (137 words)

I'm in M City. There are lots of people. I'm going down the main street. Store fronts are built up, with cameras etc. Some big event is on the verge of happening. I ask, "Why? What's going to happen?" There's a cross street. People are lined up on both sides. I am wondering which street the parade will go down. I think that maybe it will turn left because more people are there and it's a newer street, but I then see that it curves back on itself and that the parade will go straight up main street. I see a woman. I tell her, "I've moved to a new house." It's near her. She's delighted and wants to give me cookies and cakes and have a party and such. I say, "Oh yes, that's nice," but then realize I don't want to eat cookies and cakes. I'm going to the house. It's the old T City house, sort of. It's beat up and wooden. There's a pasture with a cliff to walk across. I wonder if I'll see my old boyfriend. I see his brother Max. I pick up a cat. We're going back to look at something nostalgic. I put the cat down. A white tiger walks up to me. I'm a little scared and excited and in awe. I say, "Who are you?" He says, "I'm Tigger, I'm you." I ask Max if I'll see his brother. He sadly shakes his head and shows me a newsletter with a farewell letter from "Dwight." He's dead. I'll never see him again. I feel sad. The letter is confusing. It says, "If I had tomorrow, I would enjoy today." (280 words)

Something about Howard. It was time to deal with him. Someone was packing my photographic equipment across a stream on a wagon. It slipped and fell in. They decided to save it. I looked and noticed it was deep enough that I'd have to get my face underwater, but that it was possible. I asked someone to help. I went in there myself, it was shallower then, and I retrieved my diary and dream books and other things. A group of men who had joined the army were going to help me move. I was very angry at them. One man and I talked it out some, but I just yelled in rage at the others. The one layed his sleeping bag near me on the beach. (127 words)

Going to the beach. I'm walking through a large building to get to it. Howard is taking care of the baby. I feel guilty as I walk away to go to the beach and enjoy myself. I see an old player piano and want to show it to co-worker Josh, but it has no piano rolls to put in. I'm disappointed. There is a "player guitar." I play it. It has pretty music. I walk over and around lots of things to get to the side door to go out. I get lost in the corridors. I have shop lifted a couple of kitchen items, a potato peeler, and a salt shaker my daughter Dovre made. I feel embarrassed. I hope I don't get caught. I wonder why I did it?! A woman employee in a blue shop clerk jacket walks by and I hide the items. I look for directions. I see a sign that says "beds, l hotels go to heaven." I go out to the beach. I step over a stove (kitchen), that has an oil painting on it. I stand near the ocean. I see Dovre and Ellie playing in the waves. They are older, more developed physically. I envy their pretty young breasts. I put Paulina (maybe 2 or 3 years old), on my shoulders "like a dad would" and walk out. The water is shallow for a long way. Paulina wants to go out further. I look up and see a big wave coming. I turn and walk back hurriedly, explaining to the girls that we are in danger from the delayed wave that is so big. We make it back in time. [BL] (279 words)

Someone is helping me cook breakfast. The racks are difficult to adjust. Lots of food is being cooked, an abundance. Ginny's kids' breakfast is on the first shelf and 2 blankets insulate it so that the food on the lower shelves isn't getting cooked. I realize that George hasn't any breakfast. I offer to fix some for him. I poach some eggs for him. Ginny helps me get the eggs out and she breaks one or two. I finally get to eat my breakfast. Someone says finally, "You get to eat.

I'm in a bus with other people, mostly women. One woman says, "Let's go live at the Kendell." I said, "Oh, I've lived there before. I guess it would be O.K. as long as I don't have to live on the 4th floor. People who apply late usually get the 4th floor, but if there's an elevator, then it would be O.K." My friend then goes to the center of the bus and announces that I will play a song. I'm embarrassed. I get in front of everyone and need to readjust my instrument. I glue some cardboard together and cut some down to size. I use cottage cheese as a glue. I hide my work from the audience because they will have to guess the answer to the game. Then I try to play my banjo. It doesn't sound right. Finally, I notice that the cap is on incorrectly and the instrument is backwards and looks like a guitar. I look reprovingly at my friend and tell her she put the 4 on backwards for the caps. I fix it and then I can play the banjo. [BL] (188 words)

What a lovely woman is walking by," and I look to see my guru or I see an invisible nothing. I am quite agitated.

My "brothers" and I are stealing some cattle from some ranchers. I'm in the kitchen, trying to quietly open cans of food. I use an electric can opener and it's very noisy! I get shushed and pull out a little hand one. The Mexican sister of the bad guys hears the noise and sneaks into the kitchen to see what's going on. My brothers are assisting the bad guys not to be suspicious. I am a male. The sister is upset to see me. She feels used. We like each other but here I am stealing from her family. I assure her that I really do like her for herself. She then becomes a male Mexican doctor and I become her. He's going to hide me. We hear the bad guys coming back in. I hide in a closet and put a towel over me. He worries that I'll be stupid and not hide myself well, but I'm very good at it. He and I are talking after the coast is clear and we hear them coming near again. I slide under a shelf and then Bonnie is describing how she wanted to make love to the doctor but it hurt, so she requested he come in from behind. She called it the scrota or the ova. I watch and become sexually excited and ask for Brian's phone number and then I write it down. I'm going to call him up and ask him to make love with me. (249 words)

I'm doing dishes. I'm talking with someone. I go into the living room. It's all changed around. I feel disoriented. My mother sure has been industrious! Not only did she move the furniture, but she moved the windows and built in shelves and a fireplace too! I look closely at the windows and try to remember how it was before at grandma Mildred's house. I realize that it is just the furniture that is moved. I see pretty cloth being put up on the windows and new pink lacy curtains. My mother is so impressive, it must hurt her hands and she must get tired but she still keeps doing things to make the place nice. Now there's a meeting. I must take minutes. I write rapidly. Someone's talking to me. I turn to her and say, "Hey! Come on! I'm trying to take minutes here. Leave me alone for awhile." She then does. I'm laying on my tummy on the floor. Tom B is explaining how he's waiting for a teacher to get information to him before he finishes his project. Dickie challenges him and says, "It's your fault. You need to do something first, then the teacher can respond." I get confused on the issues and write it to the best of my abilities. Aunt Elaine comes in. A boy stands behind her. She says, "Are you hiding or are you just trying to keep me warm?" She's pleasant, maternal, and wears a revealing dress. Her daughter Patricia, my cousin, is more primly dressed and standoffish. I look past them at the door and wonder if my mother remodeled their bedroom too (It feels like the S City house there). (282 words)

I'm in the passenger side of a car. A man is drawing. We pick up hitch hikers, a man and a woman. The woman is really talkative. She soon is sitting next to me and chatting away. She has my books under her arm and I'm concerned that she's going to steal them. I watch her closely. We get to a house and go in. It's time to clean up. I ask her to help put away the food. She balks and complains. I don't start work until I see that she has done her share and then I start doing it too. She put lots of things in the wrong place and I correct it. The man watches all this and as I'm washing dishes, he starts to talk to me. He says, "He worked in Louisiana, do you know what that was like?" I said, "Ya, bugs, heat, etc." He tells me about getting malaria. His feet were too short for the first 8 years of his life. (170 words)

I'm in a house. Relatives are there too. We're going to go outside to have a tennis game. It's raining very hard, so we decide to stay indoors. Then I notice that the rain has stopped. I go outside. There are lots of puddles, but I see a cement tennis court surface. I look to my right. I see a mother deer and her fawn, except the mother deer has antlers. I call to the family to see the pretty sight. They bolt, but run into the house through a side door. I follow. The family exclaims at how cute they are. They run back out. I go into the side room. I see old furniture and chairs. I realize that there are things left here from the previous owner. I'm delighted; I'll find something wonderful. I look. I find toys in a dresser, children's sized chairs and a child's piano. I also find Sony tape records, very large and lots of buttons, a small color T.V., and beautiful old fashioned dresses, one all black, and some books. I make the books be there because I am disappointed in the "treasure." I notice this room doesn't have an open door to the main house and I wonder how the family saw the deer and then this baby. My "dad" is telling me about how as a young man, he had to climb down a sheer cliff to a beach with the boys to prove his bravery, like each boy had to. He remembered being very afraid, but he did it. I asked him, "What for? What was at the bottom of the cliff?" He says, "A passive beach." I see turbulent ocean waves and wonder why I can't see a passive beach. Then his cousin Seymour is describing his first date with his new wife Dixie. They are "first cousins" and as children, Seymour ran to the car to greet the family and said to her, "Oh! There you are," and walked away together to play. Now I'm in a small room that is a portion of a long line of rooms like a hall way. I'm retarded. I'm brushing my hair. A young man comes into the room. I sense danger from him. He leaves the room. I know he's locking doors so I can't escape. I think to myself, "What will I do? He's going to want to make love to me. I don't have any birth control. I won't make love to him." I feel proud that I think ahead and make a decision. He comes back into the room. He's mean. The mirror I am looking into turns into a space heater, a cage with 3 heating elements and a door on it. I think he snuck in and put a mouse in there to scare me. It'd be a dead mouse by now, because of all the heat. I look, it was all in my head, a fantasy, there is no mouse there. (498 words)

I am sweet sixteen. A man wants to make love to me, but I don't want to. He follows me. I feel uncomfortable. He says I'm deliberately turning him on. I say, "No, I'm not." He grabs me and starts to rape me. I get very angry and beat the shit out of him. I lose control and hit and hit and hit. He goes away. The women's center decides to assist me even though I've not been technically raped, i.e. because of no actual penetration. I want to be alone but they all crowd into my office. I'm glad I don't have to worry about being pregnant. Now I go to another office. I have a 3 month old baby. The agency comes. A woman takes the baby. It's a happy experience. They give me a newborn, my new charge to love and nurture for 3 months or until it gets adopted. I sadly kiss the older baby goodbye and happily receive the new one. It's sleeping, so I put in on a chair by my desk to sleep. A young man comes to talk. He's quite surprised when I tell him I've had many, many children and then explain that I don't actually birth them. They're from the adoption agency. [BL] (212 words)

I'm driving an old car, my '61 Comet. There are lots of lanes, a freeway. Then there's snow on the ground and I'm on a dirt road. In the snow, I skid and lose control. I realize as I pumped the brakes that I have no control, so I just sit there and steer to a soft as possible "crash" into a bank. I sit there, wondering what I'll do now! A huge dog bounds up and is wagging his tail. I get out to look over the situation. I see I have a flat tire, the left rear tire. I think, "Huh! Another one!" I open the trunk and look in, sleeping bags, wires, and junk. I'm thinking, "Yuck." I'm standing in muddy puddles, and I can't find a tire repair, or spare tire. This is not comfortable. I look around to see if anyone's around that can help me. Then I'm aware that the car is going to blow up. I run for cover. A man is running with me. I run into his house. The car explodes. I wonder, "Now what?!" The man is delighted to meet me. He's heard about me and has wanted to meet me for awhile. I decide to go on. He says to be sure and get acquainted with the natives. That will be good for me. My 2 cats hop up on my shoulders and ride with me. The man is impressed. I see slug-like creatures in his hallway. They repulse me. I ask if they are dangerous. "What are they?" I step on one accidently and it pops. "Ugh." As I leave, I become aware that the man is very pleasant and I would probably enjoy knowing him. I wonder why I'm leaving. (293 words)

A large, fat woman is a guest speaker for the C. dept. In the middle of her speech, she looks sad and concerned and scared and starts crying. She is unable to go on. I talk to her and console her. I say, "Don't worry, I don't like half the people here and I work here with them." I tell her it's O.K. to do what she did. No one will despise her for it. She turns black and her face gets contorted. I'm a little amazed. I pat her on the hand and continue to console her. (98 words)

A huge refrigerator, freezer, oven, furnace combo machine. I am looking at all the nice extra features like a mirror so I can see if the pilot light is on easily. All these extra items cost extra money. I open a sliding drawer and find lots of extra "free" things. I'm delighted. there are lots of pots and pans of different sizes. A spotted green metal one, and lots of measuring cups and spoons, carrot sticks, apple slices, foods, etc. I am spooning out the white flour and I call to Paulina to bring me a container. I fill it (a one cup measuring cup), and ask for another. I have a feeling of happiness as I put things away where they belong. (123 words)

My Aunt Elaine and Grandma Agnes are the first of a number of relatives that are visiting me. I am wondering what I'm going to feed them. I look in my cupboards and find not quite a pound of hamburger. It won't be enough to make my old stand by, spaghetti. I am chatting with grandma who looks years younger. I ask her, "Don't you go to the United Methodist Church? We have one here, in my new neighborhood. There are lots of old women that have the same disease as me, but no one my age," I say sadly. Grandma starts walking to the store. I run after her, shouting to her and then haven't the courage to ask her to get me some more hamburger. I decide I'd better go get it myself, rather than ask for help. I am annoyed that I have to. It takes so much of my energy. (154 words)

American has purchased reclaimed land from the sea. It ranges from Alaska to the tip of South America on the Pacific Ocean side. It's called "Tilla Lilly." I see a picture of it.

2 other persons and myself are making something illegal. We are going to sell it for lots of money. Some people come and try to get the stuff away from us. One person comes and sniffs it to see if it's potent and starts to walk away with it without paying for it. I feel helpless; I want to stop them but I'm afraid to. Another person goes after them and asks for the money. I'm glad they did it. The person refuses to pay and gets arrogant. "So what are you going to do about it?" I pick up a small revolver and shoot the person in the neck. I feel badly but I feel better when I realize that it's a small bullet and will hurt them, but not kill them, .22 caliber. He gives us back the stuff. The one who went after the money feels sad because we'll always be in trouble or uptight because we're dealing with stuff others will always try to take away from us. I say, "No, that's silly! We can sell this, take the money and invest it, and let the money work for us." Then the mother of one of us comes for dinner. We hide the stuff and camouflage the gun. I put a tape cassette over it. The "mom" brings a good-looking young man. Someone cooks the dinner. Each serving is a lovely bouquet of cut flowers. It's too pretty to eat. I'm glad I've already eaten my dinner. [BL] (251 words)

I'm talking to my father. I put out 2 cigs that are burning in an ashtray. I see my mother smoking. I ask my father, "How can that be?" He says, "Oh, once in awhile, she'll smoke one." I am reading a book and in the book is a story of the Sanders family. It talks about dreams we have. I am confused to find such personal stuff printed. "How did they know?" Dad is explaining it. I get a sense of understanding that I've made too big a deal about it; I've made it too mysterious. It's pretty matter-of-fact. (100 words)

I'm trying to find the road to T City. I'm in the city but I can't find the way to the ocean and the farm. I stop and ask for directions. I ask an old woman. She tries to tell me but can't exactly remember. "This shopping center is gone now and that junction is changed now." She says something about Cleveland. I'm annoyed. If she'll just tell me where XXX Road is, I'll find the farm. I walk out and see my Uncle Wilbur. He's a psychic. I walk up to him. I say, "Hi, tell me how to get to your farm. I've forgotten!" He frowns and says, "What time is it?" I say, "A few minutes past 5." He frowns because I've asked him a question after work hours. He takes my hand to do a reading, even though he's annoyed with me. I'm annoyed at him too; I didn't want a reading, I just wanted directions to his home. He twitches and makes odd faces. He says, "Are you from Cleveland?" I say, "No! A woman just said that city, so it's fresh in my mind!" I am then a little impressed because how could he know that? He goes on. Then 2 women join us. One named Beth asks if we'd been together before in past lives. He holds our hands. We're in a circle and he starts twitching again. He and Beth have had lives together before and they talk about it.

A young woman (in house) announces her engagement. I am amused at her because she's carrying a scrap book for people to sign while she's telling people she won't accept the engagement. I point out her double message. She's so into her game she can't hear me. Then there is a class. Only 3 of us meet, she, her young man, and me. After each class period, I go stand in a corner to pee. I lift up the back of my skirt so no one sees anything (blue skirt from another state). The young man comes over to talk to me while I do this. I feel a little embarrassed but I'm pretty cool about it. I look at him and think, "What a good-looking man. What a shame he's such an idiot." I feel sad and a little jealous of the young woman. Now we are inside my green pickup truck (from another state). I see a little mouse peeking in. He's sitting on the outside mirror. I tell the young woman to let him in. He's been lost for awhile. As she opens the back door to go get him, I realize that it's actually a monkey and it's inside, so I tell her to hurry back in before she sneaks out. I coax him over to me. He sits on my lap. As I pet him, I realize that he's changed. He's half man, half monkey. A lot of his fur is gone and a soft human skin is there. Some magician did that. I pet him. It feels very sensual and nice. He watches me a lot. Then the young woman follows her young man into another room and hits him with a rolling pin! She is angry and yells at him and hits him. She's really chewing him out! He looks contrite and also grins like a mischievous imp. I walk in there, after putting the monkey aside. She's behind a partition and hands me a rolling pin to do the same to my young man. He comes in and I hit him a couple of times and in an angry tone of voice tell him not to play games with me. He laughs and says, "I'll leave and never come back." I have my back to him. I'm looking out the window and I feel very strong. I say, "Go right ahead. I won't come after you. I'm not going to play games." He's wavering now and stops teasing me. He walks up behind me to talk to me about it. (428 words)

A woman is eating her last supper because her husband is going to kill her. She has a plate full of nuts, almonds, filberts, walnuts, etc. She says it's her very favorite meal. I think it's a little strange. I go to talk to the husband. He's had a rough childhood. I follow him into his trailer. He's on a starvation kick. I offer him a salad. He laughs and leans back on the couch pillows. He's not interested. I notice that my blouse is unbuttoned and it's part way open. It's seductive and I notice I look like a boy that way. Now he's my husband and we're at some kind of fair. I am looking around and walk away from him for awhile. A man with glasses notices me and follows me. He wants to pick me up. I smile because he doesn't know I have a husband. I see a line of Santa Clauses getting ready to sing carols. I notice they are firemen dressing as Santas. I am approaching the boundary of the fair and I stand at a T crossroads contemplating which way to turn. I then leave and then come back to the fair. (200 words)

I sitting in a bus with Pedro and others. He says, "I wouldn't be around disabled people except it's my job and I have to, so I make the best of it." I feel a little hurt but also glad to hear the truth. "Ah," I say, "I've felt that and it's nice to know that's true." It is a heavy and good emotional moment. It clears the air. A man driving the VW bus parks it. From where we are, we can see the beach and ocean. It's night. I sigh. Pedro says, "This is where my wife and I park and neck." I laugh and say, "Maybe we'll do that in a few days (because we're going to a conference together). He and I laugh together. It's a joke to ease any tension. Then I sigh and say, "I'd really like to go on the beach." I think about how hard it will be to walk. Then I'm sitting on top of the VW bus. Cory is going to drive it off a cliff. He's all happy because one doesn't have many opportunities to do it and it's fun and perfectly O.K. to do. I'm scared and as we fall; my stomach does flip flops. As we hit, the bus starts to roll over on its side. I hear Pedro and friends yell, "Roll away from it." I do so. I am unhurt. Cory gets his leg caught under the bus. I go quickly to him and gently pull his leg out. I feel the fear and guilt from the people on top of the cliff. I see that Cory only has a scratch and is O.K. I pat him and offer him my other pair of crutches. I signal "O.K." with both hands to the people on the cliff. Co-worker Josh is first one to arrive at the scene. I remember thinking, "Of course, he would." I feel a little annoyed at myself for having to be the one to signal O.K. I'm always taking care of others. (341 words)

Someone pulls a movie screen down so part of it is a movie, and part of it is live. Hank comes out to play the piano. I'm surprised. I didn't know he played the piano! The director asks me and the audience what kind of monsters we want. "Creepy crawly crabs or supermen monsters?" I say, "Oh! The crabs." I don't want to see supermen monsters! Raul and I leave and go to another movie. It's on the women's side so I have to sneak him in. He says he realizes that I'm right and he has much to learn. I feel glad he finally has stopped ignoring my worth. We are great friends and I help him. In one seminar, there is a discussion of nutrition. I ask them to repeat it. I missed it. Then George has to go to a class at an earlier time. He's upset at first and then agrees that it's a good learning experience. He laughs and says, "Well, think about the elderly people. They have to get on the train and go and they don't complain. I guess I can." The class is over and I am trying to read many interesting books on fascinating subjects.

I try to remember their birthdays. Darcy's is XXX 3rd or so and my "sister's" is XXX the 15th. My "sister" explains that they were born with nearly half a brain. If you are born with just half a brain, you die. I see what looks like a water melon being chopped in half by a huge knife; however, they have a little more than half a brain. I am drawn to Terence's baby girl. I wrap her in a pretty blanket I knitted. I'm explaining things to her. (144 words)

I have 3 written messages for Tony W, Arvonne, and Maggie. They come to get them but I can't find them on the littered, unorganized surface of my desk. I finally find them and hand them out. Each note has instructions for them to do. Now it is time for me to go with Arvonne to the movies. She sells tickets and I think, "Maybe I'll do that." She gets there before me. I'm late because I couldn't find something. When I get to the door of the theatre, I think, "Oh well, she has the key. I could yell or honk my horn to get her attention but maybe I'll just forget it." Then someone lets me in. I need to find the tickets. I start digging around in my purse. It's a mess and I can't find anything. There is a sense of people waiting impatiently. I reorganize everything in my purse. It takes time but I feel better when it's done. Then the owner of the theatre, "Tom," comes up and says, "Well, where's your down payment?" I am surprised. I say, "What? I have to pay to get the tickets that I sell?" I realize I have no money. I say, "No one told me I had to have a down payment!" He smiles and waits. I then think, "Well, if it's going to cost me to get into ticket selling, then I'd better shape up and see this as an official job and do a good job." I get the tickets. It takes me a long time to get ready. I feel like I'm wasting valuable selling time. Then, I'm selling and making change. I start to put some $10 bills up my sleeve in a professional thief manner. I stop mid-movement, surprised that I'm doing it and think, "Why not? I need the money but I'm aware of "Tom" watching me. I'm worried about getting caught, so I don't do it but enviously watch all the money as it passes through my hands. I then start to put blue eye shadow on my right eye. It becomes darker than I had thought it would be. I start the second one, only I draw the shape of an eyelid on my left upper arm sleeve. It turns purple and I am surprised. "Tom" comes by and smiles and says, "Oh, that's cute." I change the purple to blue to match the other. (407 words)

I'm in M City. It's time for graduation ceremonies. I get angry at Andrea and I swear at her. I tell her to fuck off because it's not necessary to be so rough on little babies. She signals that she refuses to be treated this way. I feel guilty that I don't find a nicer way of telling her but I also realize that the only way I'll get heard is to yell it out quickly. She isn't going to hang out and let me talk about it. I'm now driving my wheelchair through the streets of M City, down Main Street. I drive fast and nearly cause a wreck with a school bus. I go over railroad tracks. I then turn and go down the tracks for one block. I'm on gravel and I get hit in both eyes. A narrator tells how this is very common. I get on Main Street. I pass a cafe I used to frequent. Co-worker Tyler is in there. I feel like I'd like to go in there but I'm embarrassed to because I'm in the chair. I drive on by. I get to the high school. There are lots of stairs. Some woman asks if I need help. I say, "Oh maybe. If you stand at the bottom to block me if I get going too fast." I bounce down the stairs in my chair. Then I look for the woman's restroom. I go in. It's very crowded with lots of women and co-worker Josh and one other man. He says, "Well, after the 'women's' sign there was a little 'men's' sign." He reads things literally, so he came in. I feel shocked but try to act like it's quite normal. (289 words)

I am Queen Mary. I have a woman secretary. I have a dream. The dream has a small image. It says, "Mary dances 28 times and draws a picture of a lounge area, a chair, 4 chairs around a table, with a napkin holder in the center, and a padded bar." I tell my dream to my secretary. She tells me about a person she knows who would like to take me out for a cup of coffee. As she is talking, I see a man in a green suit peeking around the corner. He then moves to sit near her. He says, "I hope you don't mind but I'm the one who would like to take you out for a cup of coffee." I smile at his naivete. I say, "My dear boy, where do you suppose the Queen of England could go for a casual cup of coffee? I would have to have at least 10 persons within visual contact of my body." He says, "Oh, I didn't think of that." I chuckle softly. He goes away. I then continue to work through the dream. I see a small printed box. I read the words. They are clear details from the dream. I read them to my secretary. "Frank G. Sinatra, Cary Grant," and a long list of other names. "Oh! Ingrid Bergman is listed as with Cary Grant." The secretary and I are very impressed with the clarity of the dream stuff. Then suddenly, I get an inspiration. I say, "Don't you see? Frank Sinatra, to the lounge, to your nephew wanting to take me out for coffee, to the sense of a James Bond movie I woke up feeling! It all fits." The secretary becomes upset. "Oh! My nephew," she says. "Does that mean you suspect him?" I nod yes and I suddenly realize that it goes one step further and links up with the secretary. She then realizes it and we look at each other, concerned, confused, and embarrassed. (Oh, I remember that when I read the list of stars and who was with them, me secretary said, "But how could you know that?" I said, "I didn't, not on a conscious level, but I must have heard it or read it sometime, everything goes into the unconscious and comes back up when it's needed." I felt very impressed at the workings of the unconscious mind). (401 words)

I am a young man. I am going down in the basement with my girlfriend. Her mother disapproves and frowns at me. She is sure that we'll have sex and play around. She can't stop me though. I smile at her stupid narrow-mindedness. We go down a long flight of stairs. I see lots of packages of Big Red gum. I take a piece and say, "Oh, now that is Big Red." We enter the family room that is the model of preparedness for company, a T.V. in every corner, snacks, etc. We go further down. We are alone. The man leaves. I feel like he'll never come back. He/I do. I'm sliding downstairs on my tummy and I get sucked into a narrow channel and I feel like I'm choking. I'm surrounded by a suspicious girl's vomit. I pull up out of it. My girlfriend is very glad to see me and angry at me for leaving and afraid to show her emotions to me. I think, "Silly girl." I pull her outside. I've got one arm around her in a hug. I show her several presents. One is a small box that has the engagement and wedding rings in it. She ferrets it out and is deliriously happy. I am the girl and I feel so relieved and happy. He does love me. I'm safe. Then there is danger. A man in costume is evil and accidently randomly seems to be killing me. I yell at him to stop it. I explain to him how he's hurting me. I beg with him. He just keeps coming. Finally, I have to hit him with a stick. I go for the face and then the groin area. There are no genitals, just a mushy round spot. That makes him back off. He allows me to escape. He's laughing. I run up the stairs and feel fear that he's pursuing. I get to the top and out the door. I see crowds of Mexican people and I realize that I'm in Mexico without papers. They'll catch me and put me in jail. I'm glad of that but I'm more afraid an evil one will pursue me. I look for a security guard. I find one. As I walk up to his table, I see an ornate wooden bowl. He wears a ceremonial mask. I explain my story. He nods and says, "Go and sleep until morning. The Divine Grace will see you then." I am worried and I say, "No, you don't understand. I'm in danger." He nods and smiles paternally. He says, "Even as you say the words, The Divine Grace hears and acts on them. Go until morning." I realize this is so and I go, relieved. (458 words)

I'm driving through Dover. There is lots of traffic. I'm looking for 5-D which is the freeway. I see an enormous blue house with many stories and lots of windows. There are jewelry displays in every window. I stop and look. I go inside. I don't see any I really want. A woman asks if there's anything I particularly want. I say, "No." A cute little cocker spaniel puppy comes frisking up to me. I think it's adorable. I pick it up and pet it and cuddle it and put it up on my left shoulder like I did Muffin Cat. I think, "I'll take him home with me." I walk out with him on my shoulder. As I get to the edge of the lawn I think, "Wait! This means I'll have to take care of him. He'll wet on my carpet. I can't just leave him for a few days, no, I don't want that responsibility." I put him down. He's so cute and hard to leave but I do. I notice his nose looks like a cat's. I go to grandma Mildred & grandpa Lloyd's "new" house and I go inside. I'm now in the bedroom and my mother's in one bed, and my father's in another. I crawl in bed with my mother. She's angry and kicks me out. I land with a thud on the floor. I'm surprised. I crawl back in and she kicks me out again. I get angry. I yell at her. I tell her off. "To hell with you! I don't need this! I can't stand people that are all locked in and can't show their emotions!" She glares at me and says, "I know. Me too. I've long not liked that in you." I gasp and say, "Well, where do you think I learned it from? You!" She's hurt. I feel guilty. I keep on yelling though. My father comes in and tells me not to yell at my mother. I feel hurt and angry. I say, "I'll leave!" Then I look out the bedroom window and I see a pretty lake. My grandparents have a small wooden deck right on it. I see their tea cups out there. I think, "How like Elliot to always have a place near water. I envy them and that spot. It's quiet and meditative. I go looking for Dwight. I find him and say, "I've been kicked out and I'm leaving! Do you want to ride back with me or not? It doesn't matter either way." He says, "Well, when are you leaving?" I say, "Right away. Maybe I'll wait l/2 an hour." He grimaces and says, "Oh, I thought I'd stay for a day or two and just see the sights here in Dover." I feel compelled to get back to E City, because that was my original plan. I realize that I have no real need to be back, and I think of how much fun it would be to relax for awhile, but I'm still pulled toward E City. I waver. (511 words)

I am waving good-bye to a very dear friend. The distance between us is growing. I make the "I love you" sign with each hand and wave them at her. I feel bereft, alone, separated, and sad. Later, I am reunited with a friend. It is intense. It is a need. He and I just can't be apart. As we are reunited, a baby lunges across the water and throws itself at us in a sense of desperation. The baby needed us so badly, that she/he "walked on water," which is a miracle. One knee got wet. We are all so happy clinging to one another. (106 words)

You said you could offer me alternative veggie foods, and a non-smoking, caring environment." She shrugs and looks helpless. Her husband comes in and says, "I've got a job in Bermuda. Let's go." I groan, "I have class. I can't go!" He says, "Well, go to your class and come later. Just drive there, but be sure not to take a boat. Of all the places where you take a boat, this is the one you shouldn't." I am surprised one can take a road and drive there. (149 words)

I'm getting ready to go somewhere. I'm doing up the dishes, taking many pills, and hoping I took the right ones and not too many. Muffin Cat has swallowed a clock and is ticking like captain Hook's crocodile. Things are messy and not quite right, out of sync. I am looking at an old photo album of my mother that I've never seen before. There are lot of pictures. Her father looks like Clyde, my father's stepdad, and a little like Jared. They had bought swampland. There's lots of muddy water covering bike paths. One photo is of my mother and Clyde standing neck deep in one mud hole. Lots of leather, and a sense of money that got lost later. My mother's graduation picture. She says, "See, Jackie Gleason, a fine poet and the world's worst comedian and look what he got famous for, how ironic." (147 words)

I'm talking on a tape recorder at a woman's request. We had met briefly at a conference and she likes people she meets to talk and give feedback. 3 men talk first. I'm impressed that she can attract so many. Then I start to describe our meeting. I tell how she was on a bus (in the driver's seat). My 2 sons and I (Ricardo and Rigo) get on the bus. The older son deliberately throws a fit and acts in ways that cause several women to think I'm a bad mom. Vivian, however, wasn't snowed, so I liked her for that. Then I'm holding the young one on my back, with his blanket wrapped around him. He's asleep and I'm pacing to keep him asleep. As I pace, I look down at my feet and notice how well I'm walking and then as I watch, I slow down and mid-step, I'm unable to go on. I am amazed at how delicate the process all is. As I talk on the recorder, I see a cardboard that is really a space ship. I want to go. Someone says, "You can go," and wraps the cardboard around me. I am reading the directions around me. I mustn't read so many books. I should deal with people and experiences more. (218 words)

I'm in my chair. I see a steam vent growing into a volcano. There are 5 of them. One is right at the edge of the ocean. I sit within 3 feet of it. I am annoyed that I would sit that close to danger. Then Ginny, Ernie, and I go down the road. We stop at a store. They go in. I wait. They come out and I see by their faces that they are angry and holding it in. I say, "Ah, you two need to have some space alone so you can argue it out and get over it." I then suggest that I leave. Ginny however says, "I'll go get your syrup first," and goes off. I start to protest, "It's O.K., deal with this. Don't bother with that errand," but she's gone. I ask Ernie, "What happened?" Maybe it will be helpful if he talks it out. He tells how one small incident lead to another and built up into a big deal. I try to point out that it wasn't really all Ginny's fault but he still can't see that, so I realize that I'd better let them work through it. She comes back. I look at the syrup and feel hesitant to say anything, because it's the wrong kind. It has sugar in it. I hesitantly tell her, and she feels badly. She goes to exchange it. She comes back. They won't talk about the incident. I encourage them to. Something about grandma Mildred and grandpa Lloyd in their house and then something about a baby that needs to be returned, he/she got lost.

I have attracted the interest of a very wealthy man. I am a quad in a chair. He has a Cadillac convertible limousine. He puts me in the back seat with him. He asks me, "How do you like it?" I laugh and say, "But it's soo big!" A black man is the chauffeur. The rich guy smiles and says, That way you have room for all your friends." He says, "I got this car for you because I don't want you to have to drive." I laugh and say, "Oh ho! Well, let me tell you, I will too drive. I'll buy a van with hand controls with my own money." He looks upset. I say, "Well, that doesn't mean I'll ever drive it, it just means I have to power to do it if I want to. That's called independence." I look at the black man who is driving and we exchange meaningful glances at my word independence and being in a southern city. "In fact," I say, "people have been known to fight wars over this very issue!" We're now walking down a boardwalk where very poor black people live and we can see into their tiny rooms where they are terribly overcrowded. I comment that a part of one drawer is each persons private area and they would kill to preserve that privacy. As I talk, we walk past people who pee on the sidewalk. One woman pees on my leg. I am annoyed with the odor and wish I had thought to walk around behind her instead of in front of her. (267 words)

A road is quickly laid down on a hill. I see the coarse gravel and rocks quickly smoothing out. I see the tar poured over it. I start to walk on the new road. I say in my dream, "Oh, it's now hard and can support my weight," but it's not. I see my feet prints in the new tar. The road is slipping. There are printed words and marks on the road and they are slipping so they don't match up. I roll off the edge to take my weight off the road until it hardens. As I lay to the side, a woman lays behind me and she must hold on to me because if she doesn't, she'll slide over the edge. She grabs a hold of my breasts and hangs on. I turn away from her and I feel an orgasm. It feels faint, and far away. I am aware that the orgasm has nothing to do with the fact that the woman is physically close to me but has to do with the biological needs of my body. (182 words)

Aunt Naomi, my mother and I are sitting at a table. Aunt Naomi is talking about past lives. I see someone changing right before my eyes. They are half-animal, a monster. I scream. Then I want to see mine. I stand up and look in a mirror. At first, I see a green face. It is ugly. Then I see an animal face, all hairy and coarse. Then I see rapid changes, like a fast chronicle of lives passing. I was a beast, a prostitute, a courtesan, and a nun in WW II. That was my last life before this one. This life is a life of transition from body, sex and egocentricity to spirituality, spiritually oriented and religious. (119 words)

Someone steals my wheelchair, the new neighborhood boys who live in apartment #9. They laugh at me. I feel angry. I run after them. I feel angry because I can't run well and they know it, so as I chase after them, I feel embarrassed, trapped, and manipulated. Then I notice I can run very well! I catch up with him and hop up in his lap. He laughs. I grab his glasses off his face and say, "Give me back my chair or I'll bend your glass frames until they break." At first, he laughs because he doesn't think I'll do it. As I start to do it, he believes me. I feel badly because I almost really break them. I take my chair back to my van. I notice someone's pushed very close to it. My brother Jake says, "See, if you move your van, then you have room." (151 words)

I'm in Vietnam. 2 others and myself are defending ourselves. We form a triangle; we lay pieces of sugarless gum out to guard us. Hordes of soldiers come at us. We fire. I shoot down many helicopters. I get skilled at where I'm to aim in order to shoot off their propellers. A sense of danger and trusting the other 2 to do their share and protect my back, as I'm protecting theirs. Then I have a bag of diamonds and a bag of gold. I change my clothes from beautiful to plain so no one will know I have these riches. I am sneaking off with them. (108 words)

A party. Co-worker Josh stands between 2 pianos and says, "I'm thinking (fantasizing). I'm singing now." I smile and say, "Ah, but I'm the real singer." I replace him between the pianos. I note that one is the old one and one is the new one. Lydia and my mother are preparing the party. They release little golden canaries in the room. I think, "They are sure pretty. I hope they don't get eaten or poop on the guests." The punch is red and lumpy. Lydia tastes it and says, "Yuck. The part where the eyes aren't cooked tastes terrible!" I try it gingerly. (104 words)

A large man with large hands and head like my grandfather Lloyd in body shape, but my age, loves me. I love him and I'm very surprised that I do. I tell him he's not the type I've been dreaming about for years. He's quiet, strong, sure of himself and emotionally supportive. I am very drawn to him but I'm afraid because I might soon get bored with him and then become attracted to another man who is adventurous, rich, and handsome. Then, I become very aware that this quiet man is exactly what I need; that there is challenge, risk, and adventure in inwardly, introspective ways. We hug. I kiss him. He puts his penis in my vagina. I help him and then I'm embarrassed because we're standing up, fully clothed and in a hallway. People could easily see us. I tell him this. He pulls back and apologizes. He says he's sorry. He just loves me so much that he couldn't wait. Then he says he knows how wrong he was. I feel like dismissing all my former bad thoughts about his actions. I do so. Later, we are making love. It is wonderful. Then doors need to be shut to keep out the upsurge of the ocean, so we want doors. I rush and shut the doors and I feel fear that it will get in anyway. An equal relationship in both of us loving each other. I feel a tremendous sense of security and relief. Finally I love someone and he's right for me. (258 words)

A group of people compliment me on my good work on "Barb's Follies," and nonchalantly tell me they would like me to create another one on June 5...3 or 4 days away. I call for volunteers. No one shows up to help me. I feel frantic and put upon. I voice my disapproval but still I try to do what has been asked of me. Rhonda comes in. A group of nurses are around a table (or park and rec students). One says to me, "Do you have a zip lock sandwich bag?," and then realizes I wouldn't because I'm not one of them. I'm disabled.

I am being asked to sing. I say, "I'm afraid." My friend (maybe Ginny) says, "Here, wear this," and hands me a pretty black, lacy scarf. She looks at me and says, "You are a lady! Act like one!" I feel proud of my new image. It feels "new born." I look lovely. We walk out, hand in hand to the stage. Ginny then cries out, "Oh! I'll cry if Rachel loves you." Her feelings are hurt because Rachel loves her. I say, "Now, I don't think she's in love with me." Ginny says impatiently, "Oh, one never knows. Only the person in love knows.

Brian has made miraculous improvements. He has muscle strength, and now he speaks clearer. I am very pleased. I lay down in his wheelchair with him. He holds on to me and hugs me desperately. I start to get up, but his need is so great just to cuddle with someone, so I stay. His nurse or attendant, whom I had hired, is shocked and threatens to quit her job. I talk to her and help her understand that nothing bad happened. I just gave him some basic affection. She agrees to stay. I feel relieved. I think I was reassuring myself as much as her. Later, Brian walks in, leaning on others. I start applauding, and others join in. There is feeling of joy. (125 words)

I am teaching a young girl princess to act. The scene is a couch. It's a seduction scene. I tell her that the night before a performance, I go to the theatre and look at the stage and visualize the performance. The girl asks me if I like her. I say, "Yes." I do like her. She is glad because she thought I didn't. We're done rehearsing and we start back. She rides with me in a go-cart wheelchair. We come to some stairs. I say, "We have to get out and walk down the stairs." Then I say, "Wait here, I have to go talk to someone." I ask permission to talk to Jim E. His secretary says, "O.K., but his assistant is with him." I say, "Fine." I go in. They (he and his wife), are in the process of going bankrupt (his wife's business). As I listen to them, I think, "Why didn't I do it that way?," (Jim E had suggested that each salesman be given part payment in cash). I don't remember why I want to talk to him. (184 words)

I am at the beach with my girls. They are distant form me. I see Ellie has on revealing clothes. I call to her to get her to change. She ignores me. Paulina refuses to cooperate and help clean a room. I'm picking up rocks, crystals, and gold and eating some of the gold ones. A plane (bi-plane WWI) flies over, very low, and does barnstorming tricks. It dives very low and then at the last second, it pulls up and narrowly misses the trees. On the second try, it can't go high enough fast enough. I have been enjoying watching but I knew he'd not make it that time. He was too daring. He flew the plane into the ocean, he keeps going even though he's under water. I want to see; I am thrilled and fascinated. I get in my van ( and I'm in my wheelchair), and drive to a little beach to see him. A man says I can't see him there. I'm a tourist. A woman in a wheelchair sits at my left. She thinks I'm part of the "family" and she says she's part of the "Jan" set. The man goes to her and is suspicious. He says he didn't recognize her in the chair. I go on my way, walking. I wonder if they're surprised that I walk. I go to class. It's on the beach at sunrise. I watch a class start in the ocean but it's too cold for them. I think it's funny. I think my teacher is egocentric and has an elevated opinion of himself. I see a list of books on classes. I'm not sure what class I'm in but I get impatient for it to start.

Leonard Nimoy and I are climbing a snow covered mountain. There are dangerous avalanches high up. I see them as small and far away and feel some anxiety about it coming too close. I stand on a large bridge high up over a huge and deep river. I say, "At least here I am safe." Then I say, "Unless of course, there are earthquakes." Someone says, "You don't have to say that!" Leonard and I go on. I see a room. It is a secret room for Leonard. I look in the window and I see metal boxes and things. Leonard is married. I follow him into the room. I think, "He is a renaissance man." I am drawn to him because of his excellent skills in thinking, creativity, art, etc. As I go in, Leonard has placed himself in a metal thing which clamps his head painfully. It's small like he has to curl up like a baby to fit in it. I watch and feel sad for his pain. I turn to go out the door. He says, "No! Shut the door and lock it. Make sure the cat doesn't get out, a large black cat." I hesitate and then do so because his need for me to do that is very strong. I wait wedged into a corner near the door. Then he grows long legs that pop out of the machine. Then he gets out of the machine. He is very tall. He leans over to embrace me and then shrinks as he falls to his knees and places his head on my breasts and hugs me closely. I comfort him. He stands up very tall and hugs and kisses me. We go lie down to make love. (292 words)

A frightening dream. I went to a party. Everyone is drinking, laughing, and frenetic. I hesitate to join them. They swirl around me, encouraging me to join them. Darryl sits across from me. He teases me and says something about a girl he used to know. I feel the same old distance from him (placed by him). I call him Howard and feel embarrassed. A lot of people disappear. The party seems to have moved on down the street, maybe to Aunt Elaine's house. I belatedly want to join them now. I drink some wine. I feel slightly high. Instead, I end up in my living room. An Uncle and a cousin are there. I greet them. I laugh at my cousin because he carries a rifle on his shoulder everywhere he goes. I say, "How silly, you are getting carried away." A man then appears at the door. He's smiling gently and wants me to join the party. I feel a desire and a fear to go. There is some danger to me if I go. I clutch my cousin and say, "Look at my hand. See the bullet wounds?" He looks. He says, "There is poison here, you've been poisoned." The man beckons me to come to the party. I realize then that they've gotten their poison into me, but not quite enough. I still can resist. I say, "I don't want to be a part of your project." It is hard for me to say because the drug makes me want to go. I say it several times and he just stands there waiting for me, because he knows the drug is powerful. I'll be sucked into another being like in the invasion of the body snatchers. I run to my "dad" and plead with him, telling him I don't want to, and to please help! I'm trying to but I'm growing weaker. "Please help me!" He doesn't respond to me other than to weakly smile at me to acknowledge that he has heard me. I grab my cousin, who before I had seen as weak and silly and cling to him, hugging him hard, hanging on like he was my anchor to that room. Then a fat lady, mostly naked is dancing at a party. Her husband picks her up off the floor and makes love to her. He is detached, fully clothed, and his back is to me. She is fully exposed. I see her vagina. I see her face clearly. A prim blonde woman sits rigidly beside them. I am shocked. This is on T.V. After he's done, the man sticks a fat piece of paper in the blonde woman's mouth. She is disgusted. It's a symbol of a large penis. Her red lipstick forms an "o" around it. Then I am upstairs in my bedroom. I wake up from a nightmare. I run downstairs, crying, "The little men are inside my stomach!" I'm crying. My Uncle or grandfather soothes me. He says, "No, it isn't possible. I've been barricading the stairs for you all night." I am not comforted. I go back upstairs. I sit on the bed and hug my nanny. She is an old square robot, and not very sophisticated. I ask it, "Why aren't there any nice men for me?" It says, "Look, there are," and shows me two of them (on a screen on its chest). I say, "But if I take them, what will be left for my brother!" Nanny laughs and shows me many women for Dwight. I am still worried. Then I'm at a dance, watching the musicians. One can't find his banjo. Then he finds it and sees that something has eroded the outside. I realize that what ever "they" touch, corrodes like that and that "they" are there. I turn and the man is standing there, smiling. He says, "It's so close. We almost had you." I try to resist.

The telephone repair men are walking in the front door. They are annoyed. I am in the kitchen with Judy S. and another woman, cooking hamburgers and franks. Hector and Preston are in the living room. We are having a quarrel. The telephone repair man interrupts our quarrel and asks if I can find a piece of wood for him. I say, "I'll look in the car." I go outside. There are many repair men out there, dressed in blue, holding blue wires. I go to the car, a blue station wagon. Blue sexy dresses (lacy, soft night gowns), are hung on the back of the car. I look. There's no wood. I gather up the nighties to take in before anyone steals them. A girl with me has tried to steal the sexiest, most feminine one. I ask for it and she returns it. Then I say, "The wood is probably in my workshop." I walk around the right of the house to the back. There is a steep set of stairs to the basement, a large old house, like a mansion. I have recently inherited it from my grandmother Agnes. As I step on the stairs to go down, I am suddenly afraid of falling. I hang on tightly to the rails and look carefully at where I put my feet. I see a set of Britannica Encyclopedias on a shelf to the left. I then go down the stairs. I see 4 or 5 grand pianos and organs like in a music store. I turn right and go into the workshop. There are many drawers full of forgotten riches and junk. I think, "I must go through all of this stuff. Some of it will be useful and enjoyable." I start opening drawers, and I find dishes, silverware, repetitions of items and paintbrushes. I find one that is the correct size of wood handle for the repair man and he goes away. Now Ginny and I are looking around. I find my old piano lesson books, color coded. I put them into a correct order. Then I find a record of my lessons on the piano. The date is 1956. I figured I was 12 years old. I am interested in looking through the book. I see lines of color. Clear color means O.K. Red means a mistake is corrected. I see only a few reds. There are lots of light greens and dark greens in the left hand position. I try to find out what that color means. (422 words)

A phrase, "The War's Over." I am a Queen. My hair is combed to look like roses. I see my bed in a field. War planes are taking off right over it. I think, "How sad." She/I can't sleep well this way. I see a stage now. A famous opera singer/dancer performs. Her face is cold, emotionless. A light is around her. She's seen even in a crowd. I'm now a princess. The Queen on my left and I walk down the stairs to the stage. It's a formal ceremony to honor the singer. I put my hand out to rest it on the Queen's arm and then I remember that rank-wise, it is for her to do. We reverse and she puts her hand on my arm. I think to myself as we walk slowly down the stairs, "The singer had better appreciate this." She doesn't. She is very haughty. (151 words)

The stray kittens plead for food. They are very hungry. I feel badly for them. I look in the refrigerator. I find some sugar cakes and some cheese. I am dressing up to go out on a date. It's a conservative outfit, but as soon as I'm out the door, I'll readjust the front and it will be very sexy. There's a bruise on my neck. I have a belt around my neck and then I put it around my waist. My kids watch. I go outside, stairs. I say, "Where's the elevator?" They say, "No problem. You can go up the stairs." I am annoyed. It will be painful. I go up one flight. Then I sit down and say, "No, I'll go in the elevator. These stairs don't go where I want anyway." (they went back doors). I see penguins that live on the stairs. If radio activity gets bad, they die and then we know. Some lie down dead. [BL] (162 words)

I'm standing in an open field. It's the safest place. No trees can fall on me, etc. There are many space crafts in the air. We are launching a car at the moon. A large rectangular craft throws the car. It is difficult. I watch the car slowly lumber toward the moon. I hope it is successful. 3 men escort me to a "safer" place. I protest. I was in the safest place and I want to return. One of the men (a friend), tells me about his father having a heart attack last night and I feel badly. I tell him that it wasn't his fault. I go back to the center of the field and stand. I see a huge Japanese ship coming close. Then I see many small round space crafts. One comes right over me and hovers over my head. I feel nervous and protest, "This as an invasion of privacy." It reads what's in my mind! (161 words)

Corinne is swimming and sees a boat, a row boat under the water. She points at it and dives to bring it up. I get worried. She's down too long. I yell at Uncle Lionel, "Can I borrow your row boat with a motor?" I get in and Dwight and Lydia come with me. We help get it up and put it (small and crumpled) into Lionel's boat. Lydia sees two prettily painted red oars. We go back to shore and discover we're wearing old-fashioned swim suits. We've gone back in time! Lydia is jabbering and bragging about it and I give her a long intense lecture about keeping her mouth shut. "I don't want anyone to know, so we can get back to our own time!" (127 words)

Wednesday. Two little dark haired boys are sleeping in a huge bed. The littlest one is restless and curls up next to the other one. He gets mad and pushes the little one away. The little one rolls off the bed with a big thump. He gets back in bed and says, "Let's look at the dragons." We then see the wall at the foot of the bed from his point of view. My cousin Sonja and I are in the audience watching. She asks, "What is it?" I say, "You'e never seen the tree leave shadows dance on your wall at night?" The shadows dance. We are hushed and nervous. Then one, then 2, then 4 dragon shapes sit in the trees. One is the little boys teddy bear with horns. "Isn't that cute?," we say. He gets scared and we feel it too. He yells. The only thing we can do is shut our eyes and go to sleep. He clamps his eyes shut tightly and the forms all disappear and it is absolutely silent. He peeks with one eye. It all comes back. He "sleeps" rigidly. His mother comes in with a young lady, his sister. She blows out two candles that had been making the forms and says to the sister, "They've been sleeping here since you've gone from the attic and been to Europe for a year." (232 words)

A famous woman like India's prime minister is walking down the street. She sees a car with a man in it and then a car with a woman in it. She has a premonition that the man will try to run over her and the woman will save her. As it starts to happen, I am her. I see the car coming at me and I throw myself up against a wall in defeat because I'm trapped. Then I think, "Oh, how awful," and turn around in the nick of time and leap straight up seconds before he hits me. I roll over the top of the car. I yell at him, "You almost killed me!" He smiles and shrugs. I say, "Give me your name and insurance." He gives me a card. I say, "I'll bet this is the wrong phone number." He grins. I say, "I'll take your license number. It is RE 7-12." I memorize it and then walk toward school. As I near the door, I see him walking, whistling happily behind me. I say sarcastically, "Here, allow me," and I open the door for him. He shrugs and accepts. As we walk in he says, "You aren't ever going to forgive me, are you?" He sounds upset like he doesn't understand why I'd hold a grudge on such a minor thing. (226 words)

I am a mother of 2 children. One of them has a badly withered leg like Dana. Some woman is doing clothes. She pauses and then stops and gets her beautiful velvet bible and goes out on the porch to read her bible. I call my son over. I start tap dancing and call my daughter over. I encourage her to hold our hands so we can circle dance. At first, he laughs embarrassedly but he's pleased. I keep him practicing and working on it. After a time, his leg looks different, stronger. He still has a limp but almost walks normally! I am so happy and impressed. I go to the woman on the porch. We are all amazed and I look at the bible in wonder. He walks out to where the guys are playing baseball. They let him play, out of pity. Then he hits one. It's a fly and the guy at first base catches it, but he has run so quickly that no one notices he is out. They are so shocked that he can run. Then he does 2 runs legally. As long as he hits the ball far out so he has more time, he is successful. One person says, "See, he's still not good enough." He says, "Well, I'll learn to be an excellent hitter. I can hit anything." The coach comes out (like Chuck), and says, "I'll send you my slow curvy pitch and see." Then a woman says, "No let me." She's a very good pitcher. I am watching on the side lines through plastic windows that cloud up or distort the picture. Then I find a place to see clearly. She's dressed in an evening gown and is going to throw 2 champagne glasses. He backs up, scared. She struts around, arrogantly, flaunting her strength and cunningness. Then he comes out, big and dressed up in a tux carrying an image of his little self on his back to show how powerful he is! Then many images come out, wave after wave, and drive the woman out of the ball park. A woman says to me, "Now, that's macho!" I said, "Ya! So true. She stood up to him tall and true and showed her strength. It scared him, so he had to run her out! He's not that carting. His image created by fear is just visually big." He comes back in and says, "She's gone." (408 words)

I go into cafeteria similar to L.C.C. Some convention has filled it up. I go to a cafe near by, but there's no room. I finally find a stand and buy a scrawny half sandwich for $1.19. I try to pay in pesos and then I find American money. I'm not satisfied with my purchase. It's not enough and it's so costly. Then I go to a meeting. As I come to the closed door, the leader comes out. He is a cat. He stands up and paws my suit jacket where he is going to up the name tag. I turn my head away to the left. I find being near him distasteful. I go in. The room is lined with women of all different shapes and styles, but they are all confused or sad, or uncomfortable. It's like a re-entry workshop for women. Most of us have on bright red clothes. The cat leader changes; sometimes he's a man, sometimes a woman, and sometimes a cat. (168 words)

I go into a bedroom. I see a man I kind of like through the window. I close the curtains. I feel sexually turned on. I thumb tack the curtains shut, very carefully, and go to the bed and experience a quick orgasm. Then I am some "wonder" creature and I am patrolling the outside of the school building. A terrible mean creature threatens me. He's after me. He grows tall in his attempt to catch me as I fly up very rapidly to keep out of his dangerous reach. I go very high very fast. All I can see is the tip of his huge finger as he rushes up to get me. My only hope is to out last him. We hit rarified air; we're nearly out of atmosphere. He finally weakens and crumbles out of sight. I am relieved because I was at the end of my endurance. I fly/fall back down keeping a wary eye open in case. Then I'm being wheeled to the stadium where I'll entertain the troops. I pass a barrack. There is a sign in the window. It says "Star." I hear the guys talking about how if the light is on, they can come talk to the star, if not, then she doesn't want company. They really hope the light will be on.

It is Friday at 20 of 6. I am packing my briefcase to go home after a long week. I'm standing up. I see Dana coming towards my office. I feel tired and annoyed. I think, "Where's Andrea?," and I realize she's gone home and can't be reached by phone. I see I'm the only one around to help. I sigh. He comes in, sits down and sighs. He tells me how depressed and lonely he is and how he's thinking of suicide again. I resent his clinging to me emotionally. I guess he feels that he gets to talk out of the office. He says that he'll go now and maybe find someone else or maybe kill himself. I really get annoyed now because he's playing a manipulative game. I firmly yell down the hall, "Get back here! I'll work with you for 25 minutes. Quit playing these games! If you continue playing them, I'll wash my hands of you and you can do what you will with your life." He comes back angry at me. He wants sex. I say, "No, I don't want to." He says I'm mean, that I have no feelings and that I don't care for him. I say, "I care for you as a human being. I'll hug you, but that's all." He grabs me hard like he'll never let go. I hug him, truly feeling care for him. Then I release him and send him on his way. I' feeling food! I'd done what I could and left room and energy for me. I said no to a "stray kitten!" [BL] (268 words)

I am in Mexico. Dovre and I are in a sort of shower stall. She's hanging onto a bar or rail, like a metal chin bar. She says she can't move it. I get up there and help her bend it. It's like a competition of strength. It's friendly. I am still stronger (and wiser). We laugh. I get down and step outside. I simultaneously realize that I am naked and that there are three mean men out there that see me. I go inside quickly. They come to the door. I get it locked but it's so flimsy. I send Dovre to get help. I am afraid. Holes keep appearing in the door. Their fingers can curl over the top of the door. They have razors. I hold a razor blade in a handle. I timidly try to defend myself by cutting them. Every time I hurt them and draw blood, I stop, because I am afraid that if I hurt them, they'll hurt me more and I don't like to hurt them. A man's penis sneaks in and gets into my vagina. I am frozen with disgust. I start to cut it off with the razor and draw blood, and then stop because of the aforementioned reason. They are horrible men full of anger and don't care about me at all. The police siren is heard and the men run away. There is just outside the door, a sort of hot tub pool of "clean water" and near it, to the right, the sea water (in Spanish, the mar), that comes in and out and splashes over into the clear water. I don't want them to be mixed (I decided the answer is that I am afraid some one would rape me if I get into a relationship). (300 words)

I dreamed that I was expecting my boyfriend back. He'd been in the Navy. A man and a woman (like Hector's parents) came into the kitchen where I was doing the dishes. I was happy to see them. We greeted each other in a Spanish way. It was full of formalities and affection. They and I knew "Harry" was coming in, so they left the room for their bedroom. I had my back to the kitchen door but still "saw" Harry come in behind me. I turned. I was very glad to see him. I walked to him smiling. He was equally glad to see me. As we embraced, a grocery sack with 6 packs of beer that he was holding was between us. He kissed me once, then twice, each time more lingering. He said passionately, "Here, put the beer in the fridge and come here!" My brother Dwight, who had come in behind him, said, "Whoa! I guess I'll go sit in the car." I had been putting the beer into the fridge. I noticed that "Harry" (it was Norman), had written letters and messages to me on the beer cartons. I read one about the president getting him enlisted into the navy. I picked up a little Budweiser and gave it to Dwight and said, "Here. There's a pool room in the next room, turn to the left." He gratefully went in there. As "Harry" and I started to move together to embrace, I heard Dwight thinking about where the light switch was. I went in to assist him. I turned on the light and said, "Is that better?" I turned and saw 3 cats. 2 of them were Darryl's and I thought, "I'm glad I didn't get a kitten since Darryl has 2." I stepped on one orange male cat who meowed meanly and put his claws into my foot. I shook him off and sat next to Darryl. He had a beer carton. It had my name "Barb Sanders," and under it, "Jen." In one corner it said, "Uncle Tom, 1961," referring to a war incident that was potentially dangerous. We chatted. (357 words)

I am a wondrous creature from another planet. No one knows. I live with a family. I go up an attic hole to a special room where I can connect with my power machine when needed. I am warned by my "younger brother" that some member of the family is my deadly enemy, one of my own kind. I use my x-ray vision and see that it is my "older brother." We lock into deadly combat. It's all I can do to just hang on to his head so his teeth don't sink into me! We struggle for a long time, growling and hissing. He gets his teeth into my finger. I feel the pain and grow weary of feeling it. My "younger brother" comes to my rescue and holds its head by the hair. We are in the air, going higher than the buildings. I am growing tired. He knows it and waits. He knows he's stronger than me. He taunts me and smiles. He offers me his wallet that has little red energy pills and some green herbal stuff that he uses to grow strength with. I crumple it all up and I drift down to the Earth. He is surprised. He expected me to eat it so he would have me. I suddenly grow very long and powerful and zap him with a death ray. I had to be so quick because if I didn't go fast enough, he'd counter and reflect it back to me. I went so fast, that I had no time to warn my "younger brother." I had to kill him too. I knew that. I am sad about it but it was necessary for my survival. I send the message, "I'm sorry" right after the death ray. It surprises my enemy. He didn't know that I had matured enough to have this capability. He explodes into a million pieces and drifts to Earth. So does my "younger brother". (326 words)

I become interested in a member of the other party. That's not kosher. Then it's a war. I swim a long way to an island looking for my soldier friend. We meet. I am a general. Their general follows us with the intent of blowing us up. My soldier turns out to have joined us. He finds bullet packs left by their general. He puts them in deep water. We are followed by their soldier. He (mine) says to me, "Wait here. You are safe." I do so, even though I'm visible and in the path, but he is right. The guy doesn't see me. My friend kills him.

I'm in a house. 3 guys are there. I'm half-standing, half-sitting informally on a chair. Two of the guys are lounging near, leaning on the chair or sitting on the arm of the chair. We are quite close. It is sensual and pleasant. We are talking about a traffic ticket I got. It cost me $27.00. They say they got one once, and it was only $119.00. Mine was for speeding so it cost more. My girls come in. We're getting ready to go somewhere and then I can't find them. I go looking. One of the guys is Zach. He follows me and stays near. It's pleasant. I am equally aware of his presence and the search for my girls. I am upstairs. I look down over the balcony rail. I see Dovre who is a cat nursing her baby kittens, 2 mal cats (male but I left the "e" off mal) approach. I say, "I didn't know Dovre had kittens!" I am surprised and a little shocked. I don't like the looks of the male cats. They look threatening. As I'm leaning over the rail, Zach leans over on me, gently. I realize he's interested in me sexually and I caress his leg with my foot while pretending to look over the rail. We are both happy. He has asked; I've said, "Yes." We go downstairs to shoo away the bad male cats. I then see that it wasn't Dovre but it was a paper cut out of a cat and many baby kittens. It was a joke. Then, I see little paper footprints leading off through the house with lots of messages I can't understand. I pass a door. It's open and a disapproving girl/woman with black hair on a bike frowns at me. A man carrying a basket with nice breads in it stands at the door. I say, "Pasale," and hope I said the right tense for respect (le, not te). Zach and I follow the little footprints. (333 words)

I am in my wheelchair, looking for a place to park near the theatre so I won't have to walk far. It's very crowded and I end up far away. I see an attendant, sort of a mechanic and chew him out because there is no disabled parking. He has an arrogant look on his face. He says, "Are you one of those hippie type trouble makers?" I look at him with some contempt and say, "I am a counselor here at XXX." He is very impressed. He offers to escort me there. As we walk together, arm in arm, he smiles and asks me out. I think, "He's only a mechanic, but it might be fun to go out for awhile." Then I find out that the person that is scheduled to play the Queen in the play can't, and I am to do it. I have an hour before curtain. Marti S tells me to make frowny faces to the sounds people make. We're all sitting at a table. I do so. One woman thinks I'm pretty strange. I'm nervous. I don't even know the story line much less the words! Marti S says, "No problem, you'll do fine," and then goes away. I wait for her but she doesn't return. Howard is the director of the play. I tell him I'm not ready. He says, "Sure you are." He has confidence in me and doesn't do anything to help me. I get a 12 hour extension. I then realize that I have the Queen characterization down very well, I just need to memorize the words. I feel that I can succeed. I wear a black ornate lacy dress and a wig. I am very regal.

I am wearing a copper suit of armor. It has fat bulges and fat legs. I say, "Hum... no wonder it doesn't fit, it's my father's suit." I then see another suit. It's slimmer and it's mine. I exchange them and wear mine. The helmet face piece keeps going up and down, occasionally. Then my co-worker in a store comes to me and says, "We had to use your other name for a sale 'B. B.'" I didn't like it, but it was already done, and besides it was only temporary and wouldn't hurt anything. I see a dress, turquoise, slinky and beautiful. (103 words)

I am walking through a beautiful restaurant, white table cloths, lots of lovely, happy people, a pleasant undertone of people talking. I think, "How nice that the inn is finally working up to its full potential." I am digging worms out of the fur of cats and stuffing them into a small hole in a box. It's yucky! I turn a light on, a white round globe like my bedroom light. It stops them from escaping and gooily wriggling around on the floor. A white cat doesn't have any worms. He sits in my lap at the inn very contented. A man says, "Oh, I didn't know you loved the cat." He kisses its ear. The cat purrs. A happy scene. (121 words)

I am watching two young boys around ten years old, one white, one black. It's been a marathon struggle for hours. They are resisting merging. Then suddenly they both smile and I feel great joy because they'd become so weary they permitted the merger. They are sitting side by side on a bench and look at each other as they speak in unison because they now know each other's thoughts and operate as one. Then a woman sits beside me on my left. She reaches out and touches my shoulder. A dark haired woman suddenly sits between us and she touches my knee. There is a slight hint of sexual overtone, but not much. A disabled man, with short legs and small feet with his arm propped up on a brace, is sitting to my right. He's discussing his sexual problems. Mabel stands before us and says, "Just like that Dr. Virginia Lee. She takes uteruses out for no reason." I send the dark haired woman away because she grabs my big toe and pinches my sore spot. I scream with the pain. I am angry at her because there is no pain until she hurts me and she hurts me because I reject her. Then I'm crying and I feel so sad. I say, "I've lost Ellie because all I do is talk about my pain." (227 words)

It is necessary to study and learn more about femininity. I see a southern talking blonde, helpless type, and she changes into a well-dressed woman with a dark suit, a black picture hat and a red rose. She's beautiful, self-assured, and strong. Bette Davis is the director. She's pleased I've noticed I don't have to be traditional, soft and helpless to be feminine. [BL] (63 words)

I am like riding with Joe, co-worker Tyler, and co-worker Jerome. They keep suggesting we stop and rest because they're afraid I'll hurt myself, go too far and stiffen up, but I know I'm healthy and capable. I'm just a little weak in the legs because I haven't built the muscles back up yet. Then we're sitting at a table and Jerome tells us how he insists to his family he must have free weekends or he will never be able to handle the confines and responsibilities and pressures of a family. He nearly cries and walks dramatically out of the room. All the women counselors go after him to give him support and sympathy and then the male counselors do too. I snicker. I know his game and refuse to go out there and support him. I note what suckers women have been led to be. Then I go out because everyone is outside. The party has changed locations. I walk up to the hugging circle, avoid Hank, and stand next to Andrea, but I don't hug her. I feel good that I didn't just automatically do it whether I liked it or not. I'm then walking Ellie and Paulina across the street, to the park. We're all barefoot and stepping very carefully over sharp rocks. I had stepped on one and now protect the girls too because it was so painful. Ellie lays down and I am dragging her. I ask her to get up and pull her own weight. Someone mentions ice cream and cake. I ask them not to eat it. They'll get fat; it's no good for them. (273 words)

I am dancing. I have a very wealthy guardian and this is like a debutante ball. I'm wearing a blue velvet evening gown. The gown and I are very beautiful. I dance first with one good-looking man, then with the next and then with the next. There are 3 that are the best that I am interested in. One is blond. Then two men escort me to a sort of "throne" chair. They simultaneously pour liquids into my champagne glass, the mixture needed to be swirled to make champagne. Outside there is a battle of airplanes and ships. Then the news is that my "father" must be captured or killed to prevent more war. [BL] (114 words)

I am in a room with lots of other people. We are hostages or prisoners. A woman has a gun on us. She's going to kill us. I am afraid but also resolved. I must try to save myself, my daughter Ellie, and the others. She points a gun at me and says, "If you move I'll shoot." I stand up. She then says, "If you keep it up, I'll kill your daughter." I hug Ellie and apologize but I know this is the only way. She understands. I love her and tell her so. I then pick up a gun and fire 6 bullets into her but they must have been blanks because she's smiling at me, unharmed. I feel a little unnerved, like, "Did I make a bad mistake?" I call out to the others. I say, "We've only got 5 minutes to live! She'll kill us! We might as well try to do what we can! What will be lost?!" A woman stands near another gun. I realize that I need the "cap" off the hammer. That's why my gun didn't work. She tries to get it apart. The bad woman notices, and she marches everyone outside to execute them. I grab her gun and kill her. Now I look around. I'm in a huge city but it's been nuked. There are no lights but the few we generated in our area. I walk around the block. I look to my right to see swirling fog, a sinister feeling. I hurry back to the lights. A man and a woman say they're going for a walk, after being cooped up for so long. I say, "O.K." I watch the spot light beam on the clouds and hear airplanes. Rescue! Then I see a huge fire engine with men and women rescue teams on it. They see us and stop. They come over. A man walks toward me. I begin crying in relief. I hug him and he me. It is such a good comforting hug! I cry and cry. Then it is necessary to leave at once. The mutants are growling and screaming in the fog; they are coming for us. I mourn the man and woman who must have been killed by them. (377 words)

I look in a mirror. My eyes are pink and puffy and the pupils are missing. I wander around the house looking for Bonnie so she can take me to the doctor. I find her. She's crying because one of her cousins has died. I turn a corner and see a room full of hospital beds. An overweight middle-aged man is sitting up in each bed, with hospital p.j.s and robe on. One man says, "You're a week late to teach your well-being health class." I am embarrassed because I had forgotten! I think quickly, then start to lecture. The man has a red face like he is blushing.

Bonnie is holding and cuddling her baby (a chinese boy). At the same time, I am feeding baby food to what looks like his twin. I say to him that he is lucky. He will feel very loved because his mom even holds him when he is diapered and fed (using his duplicate...I thought in background, "Maybe not so good. He will expect it always and won't be prepared if as an adult, he doesn't get it all the time"). (80 words)

I am at work, but it's the old "grade school room." I comb my hair (red and short). Then, I turn to leave the restroom. "Brenda," Valerie's baby, tries to crawl in. I stop her and pause to chat in the hall with her. She looks adult but sits and talks like a baby. She tells me her grandma is watching her today. I go to play bridge with Jock, Valerie, and others. I get a good hand. "4 clubs," I bid. Valerie responds, "6 hearts." I'm in convention for a grand slam. I recount my cards. They've changed. I find a weak suit in hearts. I decide to stay at 6 hearts, a conservative move. There are too many high cards out. (123 words)

I'm a government spy on a mission. The police come to my house. I pretend to be an ordinary citizen. A child is snuck out of the house by my "husband" while I keep the police occupied in the front yard. He is suspicious. It's time to make a run for it. I run to the helicopter waiting in the backyard. My "husband" tells me that Ellie has run away. I am torn in conflict. I must do my duty and I want to find Ellie. I decide that we must escape. I see a friend of Ellie's and ask her if she's seen Ellie. She won't talk to me. We fly away. The helicopter now is a square pizza racing over artificial turf. Now I'm in a room and a man in a 24 karat cold overcoat has two golden derringer pistols. He's holding them to the head of my husband. I watch for my chance and jump him. I now hold the guns and my husband is safe, but the man is coming toward me. He's saying, "You won't shoot me." I hesitate and then shoot him 5 or 6 times with golden bullets. Some blood spurts down his front. He won't die. It hardly slows him up. I feel fairly neutral. Then the mail man comes with a package and I say, "Oh! It's Ellie's picture. She ran away and I can't wait to see her picture." The man gets all happy and says, "Oh, I'm delighted. Let's see it." We look at the picture. It's satin and Ellie is wearing a blue evening dress with a white sash. It's a little too big for her. (279 words)

I have a motorcycle. A man asks to ride it. I tell him to be careful. He agrees. We are outside on the lawn of the M City house. He has a wreck and the back wheel is smashed. Then I notice that my cat is hurt. He looks dead. His back legs are smashed. I am worried and sad. Then he revives and crawls to me. I hold him and pet him. He revives some more. I go inside the house. It's been not lived in for awhile; it's in disarray. I ask the guy that lives there if I got any mail or packages. He says, "No." I want to show my oil painting to this nice man. I tell him it's a break through, a new art form, an oil painting that moves like T.V. As we look at it, several people change by moving, like (you have pictures drawn here) cartoon figures and flipping pages. The man says, "I like the old lady one." I look. I see the young one stiff and diving into the water. He says, "She's changing into a lob." Then I see a huge lake. I am looking toward the lovely shore line, trees, rugged, like Alaska. I see her laying unconscious in the bottom of the row boat, dying of lack of water, thirst in a lake of water! The man finds a tube with water in it and brings it to her because he wants the row boat. (249 words)

I'm going down a road. Darryl comes up to me. I'm glad to see him. We reminisce. There is some constraint. We don't touch but remember back to when we did. I see photos to the right, pictures of Darryl and I when we were happy. Then, we spontaneously hug and laugh. We start dancing to the American Bandstand theme song. The music is clear, bouncy, and accurate. He holds me firmly and strongly. We are dancing well together. I feel very happy. Then I'm in a race, wearing shorts and a t-shirt and a number, like a racer should. This other woman (who is much like me), and I are neck and neck racing down a stair well. I struggle hard to keep ahead of her. We are well matched. I leap over the banister and get one step ahead of her. She then sticks a leg out ahead of me and gets one step ahead, etc. Finally, I get ahead and she knows she can't keep up. She stops racing. Without slowing my pace, I well over my shoulder, "Don't give up!" She shrugs her shoulders and says, "How can I keep up? I've only had a high school education. You've had much more." I yell back, "Education isn't everything. Keep trying." Then I race on, feeling strong and good. I like running at my top speed and form. Then I see this red headed man. He's my friend. At first I think it is Darryl. He hugs me. It is such a good, supportive, affectionate feeling I get from him. We kiss and laugh, just enjoying being with each other. Now I'm directing traffic as other racers come by. I point to the right and say, "Handicapped to the right, straights this way." I repeat that several times. Then as a joke I say, "Straights this way, gays to the right," and laugh. Then, I skip over to my friend and look at a chart. It outlines the 5 courses and tells which ones are easy or hard. Course A is for music majors and is only 5 miles long. The rest of them are 10 miles long and "B" course is the toughest. I am a music major. I decide to take B course anyway, it being the most challenging. The man says, "I think you ought to try B." I agree and feel good. He is supportive, caring, and challenging me to try for my full potential. I know he'll be behind me and be supportive. I am feeling strong, radiantly healthy, and happy. I begin the race. I see a door marked "B course" and open it. I see a very tough obstacle course, a swimming pool and bleachers to run up and down. The crowd on my left gasps, "It's a girl!" I see a line of women running the course. Right after them comes a line of men. I race right after the men and I am keeping up and indeed pass some on the bleachers as we run up and down. I feel powerful and confident. (515 words)

(This dream was the night before the previous one). Ginny and I are standing by a river. She says Dwight, my brother, is across the river. He still loves me and wishes we could get married. I feel a twinge of regret and also guilt because of the incestuous aspects. Now, I'm leaning out an open window, looking down at the river. Dwight comes up behind me and leans over me. There is a feeling of sexuality and forbiddance. I don't respond to him but I'm very aware of him. I feel poignant and sad. Elliot comes by. He wants to take me out to dinner to make up for all he didn't give me in the relationship. I drift away, leaving Dwight and now I'm at a table with a plate full of food. There are beans and trailmix, and it's not too appetizing or expensive, but it's nutritious. Elliot's gone. Three guys come in. It's cousin Terence and two of his noisy friends. Terence's face is very dark, almost black (as in shadowed or dirty). I am annoyed at them. I say to Terence, but not loud enough to be heard over his friends' talk and laughter, "I don't appreciate this at all." I vaguely remember that he is dead. (212 words)

Several good dreams about Mitch. In one he hugs me. It was sensual, and felt wonderful. I responded. I put my arms around him. I felt his soft skin. He wasn't wearing a shirt. It felt very good. In another dream, Mitch complained that he was so depressed because there were lots of things he couldn't do because of his disability, and he kept losing more as time went by. I said with gentleness, "Even able-bodied people can't do lots of things." He gave me a weary look like, "Please don't say that. It's so dumb, an able-bodied response." I gestured at him to wait and I said, "I know the able-bodies can maybe do more than you, but please listen to me, somehow it just doesn't matter. Don't get hung up in depression. That's what stops her." (138 words)

A man, like Orville, comes into the kitchen. He's hungry and his wife isn't around. I'm sort of a maid. He shows me a frying pan he's going to cook something in. It's messy. I feel slightly guilty. I start scrubbing it. He is relieved. He won't have to do his own dinner. He says, "Could you start by sauteing some mushrooms?" I nod yes. As I am scrubbing, I think of his wife and my mother and how they had to put aside their entire life to take care of their men. I think, "No wonder they are so angry!" (101 words)

I am hitch hiking on a big freeway with fences. I see a lion that would come eat me if those fences weren't there. I think to myself, "How can you hitchhike? You can hardly walk!" I agree and think that soon I'll get a ride and then it will be O.K.! A turquoise and white car with a boat on top stops. As I approach the car, I wonder if the people are safe or if they will hurt me. I realize they are safe. It's an older couple, a man, single, my age, and 2 young girls. It's a family in fact. As I get in, it becomes a trailer house. The driver, the older man, puts my luggage (a thermos bottle, yellow plastic), on the top. It lies loosely. I ask if it will be safe as some of the racks are open. He says, "Sure, no problems!" I get in. They make me feel comfortable. They offer me a drink. They ask how far I'm going. I say, "Louisville, Kentucky." They are amazed. So are they. "Ah! You must be a paleontologist," (to the driver). He agrees. I say, "So is my father. I'm meeting him there!" We talk. I mention my father has a master's. They mention proudly, "He has a doctorate!" I ask if they have a bathroom. They say, "Yes, but it isn't fixed up to use." They ask if I need to go. I say, "Yes, but I'll wait!" (247 words)

I'm at an audition. They have already chosen the 3 guys. There is only one woman part in the play. I am putting on my costume. The woman director tells me and my rival to wear jeans, a half-t-shirt and a vest. My jeans are ripped at the hip seam. I'm quite surprised and comment on it to the guy that will be the romantic interest in the play. My outfit is somewhat revealing. I am pleased that I'm still slim enough to look good. The woman director leads a singing and dancing warm-up. I sing harmony and counter rhythm, like a lead gospel singer comin' in with phrases between lines. It's jazzy. It sounds really good. I know I am impressing the director. I know I'll get the part and I feel very satisfied and warm. (137 words)

Ellie and I are walking down a hall, turn the corner and surprise my parents in lovemaking. I am embarrassed. We tip toe away.

Even though it's a house, there are streets and alleys. The snows have melted and the whole house is wet and drippy. I think, "Hey, now that the snows are melted, I can do a big cleaning and put up pretty curtains." As I drive the cart, my father reminds me that to go down Royal Ave. is better. I turn the cart around and say, "You're right." We drive on. (129 words)

There is a woman faith healer. A crowd is gathered around her. I go up close and lie down on the cool sand right in front of her to listen. I make a pillow with the sand. She is a forceful preacher. Suddenly, she reaches out and places her hands on my face to heal me. She is powerful. I feel her intensity. I see religious scenes of Jesus and I know that it is working. I weep for joy and say over and over, "Oh yes! Please heal me! Please work!" I cry and cry. Later, I get up and walk away from the crowd, testing my joints for pain. It's gone. I also need to pull away from the preacher. I don't want to be mesmerized and be a follower. I do it with respect. (Before I left the crowd, I felt them all around me. I tried to stretch out my legs but I couldn't. I looked and could only see a "sea" of starched sheets. That's what they wore). (173 words)

I'm on stage. I am a student, arguing with the teacher. The Board of Directors is seated around a conference table, and they are the audience. I must hide. A man offers me a way. He has a syringe that will do something so I can hide. I let him do it. He carries me away in a little box. Now to get me back to normal, he must heat me up. We put "me" in the oven. We watch the temperature carefully. If it gets too hot, I'll be damaged. He says, "If we could push air around her, she'd be safe." I go in search of a fan. I see a man next door sitting by a window holding a fan up to his face. I ask to borrow it. He reluctantly gives me part of it but not the fan part that moves the air. Now I must improvise. I find a hose, made of potatoes and blow through it. Two oval clumps of spaghetti hungrily go for the air. "Me," in a frozen clump, moves back away from it. I don't understand and try to move the hose. The spaghetti follows it, but "I" don't. (199 words)

I'm going to see a movie. I see some chairs downstairs. I follow Juliet down the stairs. The stairs are clogged with coats, large art-type books, and people. I try not to step on the people. We chat as I go by. Then I look for a comfortable chair. I find one in the back. I ask Jock to carry it more forward so I can see better. He does. I find a pitcher of beer in my hand. Someone comments on it as I go by. I notice I don't have glasses. I make a joke and wonder why I have a pitcher (which the person called a vase). After all, I don't drink. Jock has 2 glasses. I say, "Leave it to you to think of the glasses." I ask his help in setting up the chair. It's just a bit too big for the small space and tips over the stair edge when I try to sit. I see wheelchair tires next to the stair edge that the feet of my chair are resting on. Jock says, "You know, I usually hold you back until you get all the facts (when he's giving me a client). I'm a little surprised and annoyed. He then is surprised at me and says, "I misunderstood you. I thought, you know, you said about alcohol and drugs and those guys you'd pick up on and I thought you didn't like people like that and wouldn't be good at helping them, so I didn't send any of them to you." I am surprised. [BL] (261 words)

A young woman is going away to get married. I'm going to sing at her wedding or graduation. I am wearing a wedding dress, lots of lace, and I'm well-shaped. I look fat, but I'm not. A nun comes up to me. We are introduced. She doesn't approve of me. I am making jokes about marriage, like a clown or a comic. I show the girl my silly undertrunks and laugh. She's very serious and doesn't laugh. It's time for the show. A small audience, 10 of us in lines, are on the stage. I'm second to left in front. The girl is to my left. I sing a story about a bride who broke part of her husband's tea set. She had to pay for it out of her own money. "And," I told the audience, "it has to be out of the principal, not the interest. I am serious," I say to a scoffing audience person. They don't like my message. A woman friend's daughter starts crying and has to leave the stage. Perhaps the message is too modern for her. It's like we're doing an opera with humor. (191 words)

I am a man, being kept by a wealthy man. I wear lovely clothes. I ask him, "How long can I count on your generosity?" The old, fat man wears high heels and a robe. Now I'm wearing a beautiful wedding gown. I'm female. The announcers tell how women love to swoop up and down a staged aisle in this type of dress. I swoop. It's like a roller coaster. When I'm on stage, another woman, a rival jeers at me. She threatens to tell the man stories about me. Hints that he won't stay interested in me? I must get to him first. We both begin to run. There is a massive crowd. I work my way to the left edge where I can move faster as there are fewer people. I see video tape boxes with titles on them. I grab 2 that say "Barb." I get to the street. I must cross the street but the noon hour traffic is starting. I see my chance and I go for it. I run and keep looking to my left where the cars are coming. They are getting closer and closer. I am worried because they won't stop for pedestrians. If I miscalculate, they'll just run over me. (209 words)

The woman starts to add up our bill. A cup of butter is $150. They charge me for some gifts. I refuse to pay. I give them back. The waitress is rude and calls for the manager. I am firm. "I didn't order the butter, I won't pay for it." We leave. We get in the car to drive into the night. Ellie is in the front with me. Dovre and Paulina are in the back. I can't see Paulina, but I can feel her there. Then Dovre gets in the front. It's too crowded and I ask her to get in the back. She won't. We argue. I get angry. It interferes with my driving. Finally she does. Then we go to Aunt Esther's house. It's by the beach. I want to go to the beach. I open the back window. I see a cliff and the beach. A brown cloud scurries by. We decide it's too cold to swim today. We go for a walk. I see a miniature train. There are miniature copies of grandma Mildred's coffin. I ask Aunt Esther to show me how the train works. As it moves by, miniature people smile and wave. They are cute. I wave back and feel silly because they aren't real. Dora comes over to tell me to be careful on my journey. She had gone to the same bar and had been raped by a woman. She then proceeds to tell and show me the whole story. I'm embarrassed because Uncle Wilbur and Aunt Esther are watching. She lies down in a slinky green harem-type outfit and wiggles around. She describes the woman's touches on her breasts, etc. She says, "After that, I stopped fighting. I kind of liked it."

I decide to hike to visit Dora. I walk miles through a town by the coast. I nearly walk through someone's front yard. I ask where the road went. A sailboat store has changed ownership and is a bakery with lots of gooey donuts. I walk through the store. I notice the rooms. It used to be a house, very important to me. I feel nostalgic and look at the curtains and sigh. I think someone I loved used to live here. As I continue walking, the sky darkens. I get concerned because I don't feel safe hiking at night. I look at my watch. It is 4:35 p.m. I see a gas station with a telephone sign. I go there and ask if I can call Dora. Maybe they'll come to get me. I tell her that I've left E City and I'm now at XXX Beach. He calls but she's not home. I continue walking. It's not too much further. I must have started late today. I stop at a second phone. She's still not home. Then I realize she's probably on her way to the lst gas station. I am a little annoyed at myself. "Why didn't I stay there?" I start walking back. The sky lightens up and the time goes backwards as I retrace my steps. (221 words)

I put daffodils in a crock in a tile, took a hammer and pounded them in like a nail. It mussed up their pretty faces. I was sitting next to an old man. In a large car, my father was driving, I found room far in the back. There was a baby somewhere. This old man was with an old woman, they were like grandparents. He was somewhat famous and knowledgeable but his speech was slow from age. Yet, I recognized him from my high school. I asked him if he ever had lived in M City. He smiled. He looked younger now. He said, "No," but I thought he was teasing me. I turned to him and said something. He kissed me. I turned my head and said, "Really!," pretending to be shocked. I was attracted to him. (139 words)

Co-worker Tyler and I are cuddly. He starts kissing me. I feel hesitant. I remind him about his wife. He says, "It's O.K. No problem." I enjoy kissing him. Then Jim C. joins us, on my right side. I am surprised. He wants to kiss too. I feel hesitant again, because of Tyler. Then I just sense that it's O.K. I remember feeling how Jim C's beard tickles. After awhile, we decide to go so somewhere. We have to hop on a boat to get there. I leap, chair and all, over the water to the boat. I turn and look. They have hesitated and will have to wait for the next boat. I'm a little annoyed at them. (119 words)

I am preparing to give a speech. I've got lots of notes and I'm putting them in order. I see maybe 20 or 30 file folders full of paper. Some get out of order. I go into the lecture hall. The exhibit is all set up. I start the speech with a bit on vocabulary and what words mean. The next section is a small aside about my father's interesting research. It's not really related to the main part of my speech. My father is standing to my right. He is impressed with all my work. I tell the audience to be ready to concentrate for 2 hours. Then everyone gets noisy. I can't be heard over the roaring background noise. I ask, "Who is interested in hearing the speech?" A few people raise their hands. I am annoyed. (139 words)

I go to the basement. Everything in there is mine. It is cavernous. 2 box boys work there and laugh at me. I meet someone I had written a book about. He laughs and says, "I'm not offended. In fact, I shall publish your book. It will help my cause!" I feel badly because it wasn't suppose to help them. (103 words)

We were in the arctic. We traveled by hanging on to a rope that trailed from a helicopter. We were new. We were told to go out to the snow fields and pick up yellow cards. We figured, "That's easy. We'll be close to the base so we won't take our jackets." After we got out there, walking, my partner fell and started to become frozen to the ground. I ran for my 3rd partner and said, "Call for help." We waved our found yellow cards at camp. A signal person saw us and said, "I think they're in trouble." Another person said, "Nah! If they were in trouble, they'd light a signal fire." I thought, "We would but we stupidly left our jackets and gear behind." I really hoped they'd figure out we needed them. The signal person fired a flare and they sent out a helicopter. They went to go pick up our frozen friend who is a yellow card now. The rescuer warmed up the edges with his fingers saying, "O.K., we missed the eyes, the ears are O.K." Then my partner and I helped him on the rope as we flew back to camp. A grandmother came out as we landed. Someone said, "What's it like out there today?" She said, "There's fire on the desert and daises, like that's dangerous." I said, "Ya, we saw the fire, burning in the snow, no fuel." We all went in. Now our frozen friend was a cat. A black cat ran over and licked him lovingly to help unfreeze him. We watched and commented on the caring. (269 words)

I am jogging. I feel I must attempt to go complete around the block. I know it will be tiring, but necessary. As I am jogging, I see a group of people, mostly men, all in a bunch, talking. They have plates that are valuable and are sales men or business men. I have a stack of 6-8 china plates myself, but I'm just carrying them, I'm not trying to sell them. They are looking for the rich old man to do business with...I'm just trying to get around them to continue jogging. As I go by, I see a house/shop with lots of glass/china pretties. I go in. I ask to see the old man. His son says, "I can help you, but most people won't let me, they just want my father." He takes me to see his father. It is a huge house. We go down extremely steep ladder/stairs. I have heels on. Then we are in the basement which is huge, messy and with lots of windows looking out over the fields. I see a crow or raven. He's large. Then I see a whole flock of them, right by the window. I say, "Hello! Hello," at them over and over (like my father tried to teach our crow to talk). The son likes me. He has wire framed round glasses perched on his nose. Suddenly, a lightning, electrical green light saps all around me and I am in a special room where this electrical phenomenon gives me or enhances my special powers. I look at a field of grain. As I look, my powers speed everything up and field is being cut or harvested quickly. Sheep, goats and cows are spared so they can continue to graze and produce. (294 words)

Co-worker Tyler and I are roommates with my two girls in a dorm room. I go into the bathroom. It is so cluttered with clothes, curlers, shavers, soaps, etc. I try to clean it up. I run out of room to put things. Later, I see Tyler being captured by these big beasties. I peek over the edge of the cliff. They see me and reach up for me. I try to escape. They laugh and say they'll keep trying until they get me. I can't escape, so I go hear near and let them capture me. I am put on the same window sill as Tyler. We sit and watch the beasties swim around. I look behind me and see a crack in the wooden shutters. I see some little cars on a track, a possible escape! I point it out to Tyler. He hops down pretending to stretch while he looks it over; we are whispering and signalling that it might be possible. A woman throws herself over the cliff to where the beasties are. One breaks her neck, the other lives. She's a floozy and she wants the beasties, who are also gay men, to make her. One guy is chosen to do it as "punishment," to cream her pussy. He has white makeup on and is very French and gay. Meanwhile, a man comes through the window and sits with us. He wants Tyler. to teach for him. Tyler introduces me and says I'm an excellent teacher as well. He looks me over. He might be interested. Tyler comments on his all-linen attire. The man looks at my outfit. I say, "Ordinary denim." As we look at it, I notice the greeny pajamas underneath have holes in them around the crotch. I am a little embarrassed. I say, "Well, they are my daughter's." (307 words)

I have a very small house. Bonnie comes by. She is very fat. She is wearing a hand crocheted dress and a white slip. She asks me to help unravel her dress. She has crocheted it incorrectly and she needs me to redo it. As I undo it, my father looks shocked and turns his face away, quite upset. He asks that she cover herself. She asks me if she can borrow something to wear. I go into my spacious walk-in closet and look. I see old, tattered evening gowns (sort of 1950's style). I think, "I sure don't wear them much anymore." I see blouses and then bathing suits and unders. Nothing in there will fit. I then go to my dresser and pull out a big black turtleneck sweater. She says, "That will fit," and puts it on. (140 words)

I go to a concert to see Frank Sinatra. I am surprised to see that he's a very small man. He's 2-3 feet tall and sometimes l/2 foot tall. Some large woman steps on him and says, "I brought you into the world and I can take you out." I'm seated in a front row seat with park and recreation types all around me. He comes over and sits near me. I see he has 3 eyes, pretty brown eyes, then 4 eyes, 0000. He sings a beautiful ballad. I feel attracted. He's giving me eye contact. I drop eye contact and think to myself, "Now you've done it. He won't think you like him and he'll go away." Then the "governor" comes in. He's gorgeous, tall, sexy, and good-looking. Everyone around me rushes to be close to him. I don't. I'm alone on my bench. I look up at the ceiling and tisk tisk. "Frank" watches me. The governor makes a joke. He says that the next time Frank complains about paying taxes, he should remember that the governor contributed to his income by paying to get in. Then the governor gets on his knees and hits piano keys with his chin. Everyone laughs. I am aware that I'm sitting because I'm disabled. (214 words)

I see Nate and Rochelle sitting on the front porch. Nate has sunglasses on. He sees me and smiles. I try not to respond. I feel a warm sense of happiness at seeing him and I'm thinking, "I don't want to see you." We go around the block. I'm teaching her how to drive. Now it's crowded. I say, "Slow down, be careful." She says she can't stop because of the water. I look but I don't see any water. I get out and go to a store. I find some of my belongings out in front. I pick them up and also see a beautiful pair of earrings. I think of taking them too. A woman comes by and says, "Are you taking my earrings?" I say, "Certainly not. It's just that my finger got stuck while I was looking at them!" I find another pair, they look Indian, no clips. I ask the store owner if they can be fixed. She says, "No." (238 words)

My father has come to town to congratulate me. I'm going to take him to a special place for dinner. I take him to a gay restaurant because we can get good food cheaply, seeing as how they cater to such a small audience. We are naked except for shorts and unders. I get confused if it's Howard or my father but it is my father. He wants to make love to me. I can feel it and yet he is held back by feelings of how wrong it would be. He wants to see my breasts. I think, "Why? I'm 41 years old and they droop, probably as much as my mother's droop, even though I'm 20 years younger." I feel him leaning on me to get more skin contact. I lay still with my back to him, and I feel sexually excited and disgusted at the same time. I'm his daughter. This isn't right. I imagine or sense his erect penis. I think, "If he tries to put it in me, then I'll know he's trying to be sexual." He does everything but put it in. I wonder why we are in bed together but I don't move to get out. I said no real clearly without guilt. (210 words)

I am in a wheelchair, going to a doctor's appointment. When I get there, the nurse tells me he's got an emergency and must leave. I get very irate and write a note. I say, "I'm very busy too. He can call me later." The pains are very serious. I leave. I'm in a manual chair but it moves like a power chair. I sign my name differently in the note. I am Olgn G Alix or someone. I wonder why I did that. I get to the elevator which had been held in place by a manual chair. I hear voices talking about me, how selfish I am, and how no one else can use the elevator. A cute man in a wheelchair says he's met her before, he doesn't wait, he just goes up a ramp. Now I'm me watching the selfish woman being carried down a long flight of stairs just to see some ceramic vases with gilt on them. The guy and I walk about her. Then we go on. We like each other. I see a book store that we both want to go in. We do. We each go to our own particular area of interest. He goes to the H row, and I go to the B or C row. It's a mutual enjoyment. We're polite and would give it up for the other but we are understanding of each other. It feels nice. Then we see a stereo, an old one for 45, 55 dollars. We dig into it and see old music books and things. The guy really wants it, so when he's somewhere else, I bargain the sales guy down to $10 dollars. He says $18 and no lower. I offer $15; it's a go. Then we are outside, standing in water and I'm going to give my present to this nice guy that likes me. (316 words)

I say, "I'd like to see him again to say hi!" She's nervous, so I say, "We're just friends now. It's O.K." She gets her appointment book out. "No, not this weekend. Oh, it won't work next weekend," etc. I think she must be awfully insecure about their relationship. She says she guesses she doesn't want to share any of their time with anyone else. I laugh, very superior. She gives me a package of permanent curlers. I say, "What am I supposed to do with these?" She shrugs. I say, "Oh, you leave them here for the thrift shop."

She says, "You need to buy your own." I go looking but I don't really find what I want. Someone comments that things are really icing up outside, like we're in Alaska or some place frozen. A man is near me. He seems to like me and me him. I still hesitate to buy anything. Some people, a family, goes out to their tent. Even when you pee, it freezes and is solid ice as it hits the ground! The man and I go back to the store to get mittens, hats, etc. The woman store owner asks what we want. The man bargains with her; we get things half price. He puts his arms around me and I lean into him. I kiss him on his cheek. I look for mittens. He brings a spray can. He sprays it around his neck and then mine. It's a white cloudy material that has sparks coming out of it. I don't want to breathe it in. It is supposed to keep us warm.

I am preparing to go out and perform to a group of people. I walk out of the house, onto the porch. They applaud. I notice the applause continues even after they stop clapping. It's really some other group behind a wall responding to some other group. I start the intro. As I'm speaking, the group gets up and leaves. I call out to them, "Wait we've got a good show!" Only 4 or 5 persons remain. I say, "Oh well, the show must go on." I start the show anyway. I go in to get the rest of the "Birds." By now the audience is wandering all over the lawn. I go out there to see the stream that this guy likes to fish and relax in. I find water standing in a field of crops. At first I think, "That's it." I notice rows of funny looking trees. They have a name. Then I see the stream. I go to the edge and look. I start sliding. I reach out my arm to a woman and say, "Help me, I'm slipping." She is neutral. She doesn't help. I hang on, hoping and finally in desperation, I put myself up out of danger. We go back to the house. In the hall, lots of waiter people are working hard. Nate says he's going down to the basement to check it out. As he leaves, I fall head first down the laundry chute to the basement and get there before he does! A plump guy follows me because he knows that I'll be accused and will look guilty being there first. He wants to help me. He gets there and goes to meet Nate head on. The hall is now the inside of a diesel truck. The interior is painted red and there is spooky danger there! He calls out, "Howard! Howard!," (I wake up). (315 words)

A woman, a man, and I are trying to decide what day to get together. We decide on the 14th. Then the woman wants to change it to the 3rd. I say, "It's possible, but I have other commitments and wouldn't be able to give as much time." The man is disappointed. He wanted more time with me. I get annoyed at the woman for thoughtlessly creating problems for the man. We all agree to change the date back to the 14th. Then we go out into the city; there is some danger and we must flee. We see a crowd. It is waiting to see a famous dance troupe. I ask how long we'll wait. The woman says, "An hour." I say, "They'd better be good then." She says, "They are the best in Mexico, just like you are the best in the U.S." I am modest and say, "Oh! tat!" The man is sitting on the same bench. I go over to him and kiss him. He and I cuddle. It's nice. (174 words)

There's a war on and I'm trying to stop the soldiers from fighting, even the ones on "my" side. I capture the guys, seven of them at gun point, and order them to tie each other up, seated in chairs. They are real arrogant but do it. They tease me. I like the leader and he likes me. Then the enemy keeps firing. I try to respond non-violently. Finally, I take a gun and point it at the enemy woman and say, "Stop or I'll shoot." She decides to call my bluff. She watches me closely as she starts to walk away. I fire at her, deliberately missing by inches. She keeps moving. I yell, "Stop or I'll shoot you!" Again, she calls my bluff. I fire at her but I've run out of bullets. I reload the gun (which is white). She's gone by now. I have to decide whether to untie the men soldiers. I hesitate but then do so. Then he introduces me to a group of male giants, "International XXX Thumb group." The guy is so tall that in order for us to talk, he first gets on bended knees and he lays down on me, so we can be eye to eye. I tell him that he can take his group to the enemy castle and all peek into the windows. It will scare the enemy. They agree to do it. I then untie more of the men soldiers. The leader says to his buddy, "She thinks I'm leaving here, but what she doesn't know is, I'm not. She'll have to stay here with me." Here is North Africa. (274 words)

Mabel and I are trying to put together a puzzle. We pick pretty beads from a basket and place them where they belong. I think Shea was there too. Later, I take some kids to the store. A couple of teens take some candy. I tell them to put it back. Then I see Paulina scooting out the door quickly. I run after her and stop her. She has candy in her mouth! I say, "How dare you! Take it back at once! I'll lose respect and love for you." I am very angry, and she goes back. She and I go to the clerk. I say, "She took this candy." The clerk shrugs and says, "Oh well, teens do that." A man walks up to me and puts a soda bottle on the counter. He says, "You pay for it and I'll reimburse you later." I am so busy with Paulina I don't really attend and agree. Then I turn to see who this is. I know him well and I laughingly agree to do so. [BL] (177 words)

I'm in the M City house. Howard and the girls are there too. Dovre is working on a school project that requires pasting papers to a poster in an interesting design. She finally gets it done. I hang it up on the wall. I feel relief. Howard says, "At least you didn't say you were tired of it like you said about receiving roses from the fair." I am a little embarrassed because receiving roses is a special favor, but I felt it was sort of off-handedly done and wasn't special. (91 words)

I am observing Dovre in her 1st grade class. It's music time and I am given a drum to play. So is Dovre. She has a base drum. Mine is more of a snare drum. The teacher brings me a clump of black and white beaded necklaces all clumped together. I help her try to unravel one black necklace out of it. We succeed. I now do a solo on my drum singing in front of the class. (78 words)

I am in a room with two clients and the professor. The woman is very rude and child-like. The man is very insecure and the community college student, like the professor, is very pompous. He sort of takes over the questioning. The woman whines and complains, interrupts the man's story and takes the conversation into different directions at the drop of a hat. I give up. I can't get her to shut up so I can counsel and don't really try to hard. It is so funny to be watching the dynamics of those 3. The professor says, "Let's reverse role play." The man says, "That's not necessary." I say, "It is, because we can't see what's wrong in ourselves. We need to be shown." He doesn't like it. Later, I'm at a hotel, a convention. The guy comes over to explain how much better he's doing and describes how he's opening conversation with people now. I am very pleased for him and sort of wonder why he's following me around on my off hours telling me this. I walk to the elevator and get in. It's very similar to the counseling room. That woman is there. I sit in a rocking chair, I insist. I say, "I need it." The woman is crying very dramatically about someone having died and left her. I don't want to hear anymore clients. Now the elevator gets stuck. Other people are on it. Someone is murdered in an adjoining room. No one knows who did it. The elevator, which was out of control, stops finally. A small man with grey hair pops out fast. I suspect him. Then another one, very similar, hops out of a panel near the door and runs out. Now it's a James Bond movie, like, we chase after, the crazy professor spy laughing and keeping up a steady chatter, the woman and I. The spy gets on a plane and 3 planes take off. I watch as the first one catches on fire and explodes, then the second and then the third. Now we are sort of survivors of that. It's snowing, like the North pole. Survival is difficult. My character, now male, puts his feet up on a hot stove, lights a cigarette lighter and has some hot coffee and food. "Fortunately," he says, "we have the means for survival. Too bad he's here," referring to the crappy professor who is setting up a sleeping bag. "He can stand anything as long as I don't touch his Mary." The professor echoes, "That I couldn't stand." The man, "or that other woman." Professor, "I could stand that, but I wouldn't like it." The man, "or...." Professor, "I could stand that..." on it goes. (455 words)

I have a 3rd grade class. We have taken out records, music and books from the library and are looking at them. It's a bit chaotic but manageable. I receive a gift from my brother Jake. It's a small record player. The tag says, "Rather than give the money to him, I'd rather give this to you." I think he meant tax money to the government. We are playing rectangular records. The kid helping me doesn't get it quite right. Time's up for class. They all straighten their desks and quiet down. They have big poster books open to a page of alligators. I shush them and then tell them I'm very happy, thrilled, and excited about their good behavior. I dismiss them. (123 words)

I am visiting someone, I think Thea. I'm on the porch. The neighbors are around. A woman is talking. She says she's the land lady of a place up the street. There is a young couple that can't afford the rent. She's willing to cut the rent in half if others are willing to help raise the rest of the money. They ask me to donate. I hem and hah and finally agree to chip in 1 dollar. My daughter Dovre agrees to add some change. Then the girls go out to collect more money. We take it and some food to a gathering. I am thinking, "Maybe I'll keep my dollar since it was my girls that raised the money," but I feel shamed and cheap and leave it in. At the gathering, there are lots of people. A principal of the school asks me to compare my daughter's school with my own. I say, "There's not much to compare. There was the 1950's and now there's the 1980's but they are blended together. They are the same in many ways!" It's time to leave, I can't find my shoes, or the bowl the fruit came in. Then we find both. Out in the street, a strange looking midget walks by. As I go into a house, I hear Dovre calling for her dad piteously like he's drunk and lost in the neighborhood. [BL] (234 words)

I look forward to being sexual with him. Then we are in bed, but he's Uncle Wilbur. I'm feeling very disappointed.

I'm in some group session, a facilitator. A woman rushes over to Eric and jumps on him. She wants to be affectionate and possibly sexual with him. Because he's blind, it startles him a great deal. He's scared. He throws himself face forward on the ground to protect himself. She is upset and angry because all she's got to contact is his back. She goes away. Eric sits up. There are tears in his eyes. He needs my support. He reaches over and envelopes me in a hug. The woman is crying too. She feels rejected. She's trying to pull Eric off me so she can be hugged by me. I tell her to wait. I say, "I know you feel badly and I want to help, but you have to understand. Eric's blind. You scared him. He needs me more." [BL] (141 words)

I am helping at a cafeteria style restaurant. I dish up the potatoes, mashed, the peas and the gravy. Some of the customers are impatient. They want the spare ribs and aren't interested in the side dishes. I tell them they have to get the side dishes first. After awhile, I run out of potatoes. It's time to clean up and leave. My man and I finish up and start to walk over to our quarters. We have our arms wrapped around each other tightly. It is affectionate togetherness. We walk in unison. Someone is thinking, "Aha! Love among co-workers. I didn't know they were a pair!" We go in to sit at a long table. My chair is broken. It has no seat and it's crowded up next to co-worker Jerome. I remove it to get another chair. Now it's bedtime. I go to my room. Now that I have a man, it is changed. A blue bedspread. The clothes are all picked up. The pink stand is on my side. I get into bed. He's already there. We cuddle. (181 words)

I'm a Queen, maybe Elizabeth. I am visiting a country, probably Iceland. It's nearing the spring there. I must walk across the ice floor. It's dangerous. If I step on the wrong part, I'll slip in. Guards come with me to hold on to me and point the way. They place cardboards and pillows when I should step. I tell them, "My balance isn't good because of my ankles." Off we go. I nearly fall in several times. We get to the side where I sit in a chair at a table. It is sitting on the ice! (98 words)

I notice there are some rabbits in there too. They are in plastic bags. I pull them out. The kitty is trying desperately to get out. I shut the door. After awhile, I notice that there is a white mist in the room and I realize that the kitten has put the gas pellet in my room. Coughing, we escape outside. Later, I hear that cousins Patricia and Terence are getting married. I am concerned, after all, they are already brother and sister. Then I think, "I guess it's O.K. They are really just cousins."

I'm teaching Spanish to a small group while the teacher is out. I create a long sentence and write it in English on the board. "The City of Springdale with clothes and things give me XXX." I am standing at the board asking the group to give me words in Spanish, la cuidad de Springfield, etc. I lament that I should never have chosen this sentence; it's too complex. I ask 3 women to tell me in Spanish what they see out the window. They do so. I don't understand all they say but I pretend to do so. I look out and I say, "Unhippie." Then, co-worker Tyler comes by wearing hippie clothes, rhinestones on his face, a moustache, etc. We talk. Then it's time to leave. We are all camping near by for the weekend. We step into the bathroom. A woman complains that when we turned on the water, it put cold water in her shower and she wasn't done yet! We go to the bathroom and then notice there is an organ in the room. Then we go outside to get into the VW bus. I get in and it's cold. The seats are like rocks inside a refrigerator. I am a passenger in the back. The driver is paralleling the ocean. We hear rock and roll. Someone says, "Johnny XXX is here." I'm glad. Then the driver drives into the ocean, paralleling the road. I say, "You're in the water. Is that safe?" She says, "Sure. I'm on the beach. No problem." We then are still in the car but are standing and running, our feet splashing on the water-soaked grass. I look up. A fat yellow woman is ahead. Even her nipples are yellow. We nearly crash. Now we are running along side the VW bus. (302 words)

I am a man, swimming in a river. There is danger. I swim and save Superman. We get to shore. Superman shoots arrows into the swarm of alligators that had been chasing us. He tells me I have been chosen to be the leader of a religion. I am to walk up a hill to my new temple and meet my bride. I do so but I'm uncertain. It's a steep hill and I find an old run down building. I guess it's not fancy because we are a primitive tribe and it's trying to blend in. The first floor is empty probably for meetings and dormitories. I go upstairs. It's the "church" part. On one wall is a row of small square windows letting in beams of light. The room is dark. I see the alter and feel great relief. The symbols of the god are similar to our tribal god. I go behind the alter and find a small crowded kitchen. A blond woman is working and I realize that is to be my bride. We are both embarrassed and kind of look each other over. An older woman is working too and she says she'll help out for awhile. I say, "Oh good and maybe you'll stay and do the work." She gives me an exasperated look and says, "I'm a woman and I do woman's work and I don't get paid. Everyone thinks I'll help out for free. I want to be paid." I say, "Oh, sorry! Sure." (252 words)

The girls and I are going swimming. I get in the shallow end and dog paddle around gingerly. Then I feel challenged to swim with long strokes out to the deeper area. I do so somewhat hesitantly. I stay near the pool edge and Dovre stays by to rescue me if necessary. We get out of the pool/lake. It's fairly crowded. We start to walk down the street. I have trouble walking because my both legs are in one pant leg, like in my mermaid suit. I kind of shuffle, hop along. Then it changes to normal and I walk. I notice a Christmas parade is coming down the street. It's colorful and noisy. We stop to watch it go by. My grandparents (Agnes & Clyde) are there and so is Aunt Esther. The parade is sort of happening through their living room. There are lovely, yellow, lemon-smelling candles. She sure has a lot of candles; her kids must be at that age. Grandma Agnes quarrels about a duck bowl. Rochelle is sitting on a piece of furniture doing a commercial. Half-way through, she runs out of things to day and hops down. I am annoyed at her. She finds a book and asks me to explain it to her. I start teaching about saying yes to a scene and not giving up. She seems to be interested. [BL] (228 words)

Some people and myself are on vacation. We're driving home. I'm driving. I need to stop at a rest area to pee. I pull over. It's a bumpy ride and I have some trouble getting the car to stop. We all get out. I can't find a bathroom. A woman calls me over to see a big booth with used clothes in it. I think, "Great," and I start to sort through them. I find some I like and take them, feeling a little guilty. Then I find myself putting some back from my own clothes in the car. I'm trading all my old things I don't want anymore for old things that are new to me. It helps me feel less guilty. I have some baby outfits. I comment that they are too small for the baby now. I say, "Hey, you don't have to leave the hangers too." Then I see a Mexican skirt of mine that I like and I say, "No, don't trade that one," and I take it back. I go to the car and come back. A young good-looking cop is there. The woman says, "I told him you were driving." I realized that I was the only sober one in the group. Everyone else had been drinking. She then says, "We're being fined for taking these clothes." I asked how much the fine is. He says, "$100 each!" I am shocked. Then he asks me to walk over to where we had first been pulled over. He takes my elbow and asks if I can manage. I say, "Of course!" There is attraction and antagonism to him. We go there. He says, "What do you see?" I look and see what looks like a meter box. It says "Department of Motor Vehicles." I say that. He says, "No! Look again." Then I see the ocean, the big waves crashing onto the shore. I say, "Oh ya, that!" He says, "Why are you over here looking at a little rest stop and not over there looking at that?!" I sigh and explain, "We've been looking at that for a week now. We're tired of it and we're on the last leg of the journey for home. We just wanted to stop for awhile." Then he walks me back to the car. It's going to be towed. I think I called to it by name and it came to me. I convince the cop that we are O.K. He and I look at each other warmly. (421 words)

I want to invent something or discover something no one else has. I decide to time a flock of sheep as they run up a steep hill. I run up the hill with them to chase them, so they don't scatter. If I take it one step at a time, I know I'll make it. I get to the top and find Lydia's house. I go in to wait. We chat. I see there are some dishes to do. I race with Lydia to get to the sink first. I dip my fingers in the water and say, "Me first." We laugh. She finally gives in and lets me. I start washing. I think I see one of my daughters in the sink. I put my hands on my hips and say, "Ellie, get out of there now." A man is watching all this and smiles. Then I don't see her. I say, "How embarrassing. I thought she was in the sink." My cousin Deirdre is there. As I'm washing dishes, Doug and Lydia tell me about a new kind of wool they've discovered. The sheep gave a wool that is a natural polyester. I look at the knitted sweaters and admire how nice they look and feel. Then Lydia goes outside. Suddenly she wells to me to get the gun off the top of the refrigerator and save her. She is being attacked by a beast. She is screaming. I run to look for the gun. I find lots of junk and pliers but no gun. I feel helpless and frustrated and I paw through the junk frantically.

I'm disappointed and say, "No, not there. I can't see it." She shifts it around and books fall sideways and all over. My father insists on moving the piano near that corner. I look around and see lots of old furniture, records and stuff, all my parents stuff. I see the beauty of the room, the lovely windows, the beautiful hard wood floor, and I feel sad that I can't just get more of my parents' stuff out and let the room be mine. Aunt Elaine is there. My mother looks out at the mail boxes and says, "The bills are gone. Someone has picked them up." She's annoyed. I start reading a book that explains that there are hidden puns in dreams. It shows words and how when you break them up, you find the answer (Er rick da Erro Rick, Spanish for gives), like that. There were other examples. It made me want to examine my dreams more closely. Then we get in our car. My father is driving and I'm thinking, "Well, here I am in M City again. What will it be like this time? Who will I meet?" (259 words)

At intermission, the leader and I go down to congratulate him. We are disguised. He recognizes me and doesn't say anything. Later, I must use my ray gun on a group of 5 people who are the leaders of "the other side." It sort of melts them into a trance or kills them. One woman gets angry and is surrounded by the color purple. The rays don't work on her. I tell my friend, "Don't let her tell anyone else or we're in big trouble." I go the other man who is in a trance and tell him not to believe what JoAnne will tell him. I repeat it in the mike of his video equipment. He agrees. (192 words)

Bonnie asks me to walk with her to go get something she forgot. We are packing for a trip. We walk down a hill and she asks if it will be too hard for me to wade in the water and grass. I am a little annoyed but say it's O.K. I slosh around a little unbalanced at times. I get the items she had forgot. They are metal refrigerator racks. As I'm walking back, Bonnie says, "Be careful!" I look around to see what the danger is. I see nothing amiss. She says, "There can be danger from salt." She means that when I hug the metal racks, corrosive salt could get on me. We go back up the hill and find ourselves in Mexico, in a park plaza sitting on a bench innocently flirting with guys. A Mexican cop comes and arrests me. I laugh because it must be some joke or misunderstanding. He is serious and takes me to jail. I tell Bonnie to help me, "Don't let me be forgotten." Then the cop takes me to the desk clerk. He says, "Here she is." I say, "Have you seen this face on any wanted posters?" She is unsure. I figure she should realize and let me go. She doesn't. We walk down long steps and corridors to my cell. Mostly guys are in this wing and it makes me nervous. Paulina and I are getting locked up in a tiny cell. (245 words)

I'm walking and it turns into a journey. First, it's summer and quite lovely. Then, it's winter, with snow and hills. I stop at a cafe to rest. Some idiot man tries to harass me. I yell at him to leave me alone. I'm tired and I don't need him. He keeps it up. I get up and leave. I walk now. I am stopped at a large body of water. I'm trying to figure out how to get to the other side. A man offers a sort of ladder, boat. I put a small baby in my backpack. The "audience" is anxious, hoping I don't fall in the water. I make it to the other side. I mourn the fact that because I'm on a journey I can't take my "things." There are piles of boxes and sacks, small teddy bears, Christmas decorations, etc. Then I leave everything and continue on my journey. (154 words)

I am going to the beach. I have my 2 piece swim suit on but the top is a little loose and the nipples show. I go inside the building. I can't find my towels and then I find them in my hands, dragging in a puddle. I go to the bathroom and think, "Now how am I going to get my top back on?," (I had taken it off to go to the bathroom). Mirabelle comes along and ties the strings for me. We start to go outside. Now I see a woman sort of dancing. As she dances, she transforms herself into a series of plastic shapes. Finally, there is nothing left but objects de art. A chubby faced man with bad teeth, notices this and starts wondering out loud how to make the most money. He asks me to move out of the aisle so customers can get to them. I go up first and see a plastic square that has her picture in it. As I look at it, she winks at me and says things. I ask how much and pay $2.00 feeling I've got a good bargain. I show it to Bonnie and say, "Watch this!" She (the picture), doesn't move! I say, "Oh great, now Bonnie will think I'm crazy." I advise Bonnie to stare at it until she does move. She finally does. It's a wondrous gift. She can tell me things I need to know. (244 words)

I go to the bathroom. A young boy is playing nearby and drags his plastic toy through the urine. I tell his mother and then take it to the sink to clean it. As I do so, Lydia comes over. She looks horrified and says, "Oh! There's a louse." She sees two or three on the sink and my hand. She looks at me. I say, "I don't have lice!" She is suspicious of me. I walk out to the car. My "man" is there. We sit in the back seat together with some of Lydia's kids. (97 words)

I'm at grandma Mildred's house, packing to go somewhere, maybe school. Bonnie is around. Then my "son" wants to build a harp. I tell him, "That's too hard," but he insists and does build an ornate, complex instrument that sort of folds up. I then find a picture, a photo, where you can see the jigsaw patterns. One part still has the puzzle pieces on it. We remove the parts. Something is wrong with the lady's eye. I called it a name and ask what was wrong. No one knew. The boy is impressed. He says he's amazed at how talented I am. I am equally amazed because he's more talented than me! Doctor A, doctor drama, acting. (118 words)

The girls and I are at a track meet. We are high in the stands and I can't see too well over the crowd. They start running. I go across to see them as they leave the stadium. Some of the runners are good looking, some are M.R.'s and are very uncoordinated. I see one in trouble and go down to help. An older man, sort of like Ray Milland, likes me and flirts. I flirt back and then go back to the top of the stadium. I watch more runners. A cow with horns threatens them. I take my German book down there. A woman official is very pleased with me and walks back up with me, encouraging me to join their elite group, with the guy too. She says, "How do you say it in German?," and I say, "Du bist muy wonderful," and laugh and say, "It's a joke because the last two words aren't German." I remember my German book down by the cow. We go down to get it. She is very pleased with me. When we come backup, Ray Milland is walking with me arm in arm and we are laughing and enjoying each other's company. (202 words)

A Mexican man and myself are walking toward the beach. We are told by the gatekeeper to take a certain path. The Mexican suggests we take a short cut between two houses. We sneak by but the gatekeeper comes after us on a motorcycle. I plead, "The reason is that I can't walk well," and I ask for a ride on his motorcycle. He agrees. I can't figure out where to put my feet. I figure it out and we go. We are taken to a cottage. I look for the bathroom and sit. As I sit, I see a huge mama cat feeding her many babies, some were blue and some were pink! The motorcycle man comes in and I'm a little embarrassed.

He gets out and falls in again. Then we all sit down on the path to listen to speeches. Mondale starts speaking. It's pretty boring. They ask me to speak. I point out I'm smarter and more interesting to listen to. Later, a comedy troupe does a bit where a woman kisses a woman. They all look for the crowd's reaction. Everyone laughs.

I'm at work but it is the old M City house. A man asks me about my banjo. I had advertised it for sale. I say, "Oh yes," and bring it out. It's all beat up, with strings missing, a guitar neck, and a square cigar box body. He's pretty contemptuous and asks brusque questions. I can't remember some of the answers of how to restring it and so on. The man, an administrative person in a 3 piece suit, asks me how it will sound, seeing as how it is so crummy. I am a little annoyed and say, "It's the length of the neck and the size of the body that makes the sound." He had suggested we change it radically. He says, "Let me hear it." I try three chords, after trying to remember which ones go together. I do A, E and D? It is lovely. We are both impressed. He says, "Well, I am interested. Let's have dinner tomorrow night and discuss this in more detail." I agree, trying to remember his name. I thought it was Bill Pourter. I feel a little scared as it's plain. It's a date. I look at myself. I'm wearing a lovely dress, with nylons, my hair done nicely, etc. Ethan comes in and asks where his photo album is, the one with his wedding pictures in it. It's not where he left it for people to see. I say, "I'll go ask Valerie," and I'm thinking, "Oh, I want to look at them." Valerie says, "There's a check out sheet near the place where they were." Ethan says, "It's gone too." Valerie says, "Oh, it must be one of the 'boys'. They probably have it," (her office is in the kitchen). (293 words)

I am in some kind of couch in a restaurant. Arthur comes by. We talk for awhile and then we start kissing. I don't feel sexually excited but I am glad. I feel warm and loved. I am happy that he likes me even though I feel the fear that it won't work out. He says he's going to a movie and he'll call me later. On the spur of the moment, I decide to go to the movie with him. He says, "Great," although I feel some hesitation from him, like I'm trying to rush it. He says, "See ya there," and goes. I get off the couch. I feel tired and sort of regret saying I'll go, but I would like to see the movie. The woman that owns the restaurant comes to me and says she's so surprised that Arthur and I were "oral" so fast. I explain that we had an affair once before, "in high school" and then I had fallen in love with Darryl. "It really was love," I say. She says, "Well, it's none of my business." We go up to another restaurant to eat before I go meet Arthur. As we are eating, she shows me a picture of the women that work in the library. Some of them love Arthur and she thought it best I know. They have long pointy faces and are in renaissance costumes. I then look out the window and see that the British are coming on boats. It's war. A canoe/boat with explosives is rowed under our building. It explodes and the building sways and then topples. I am at the window and as it falls. I dive out to safety in the water. I swim fast. Some bad guy is after me. Then, the water is in a narrow wooden tube. I swim. I am running through a modern city on the freeway. Then, I am swimming again with the people in hot pursuit. Again, I have to dive. There is a seal. I have to dive beyond the contaminated water or I'll get warts. I do and I continue to run and swim. I take some of the contaminated water and put it in a bottle and put it in my pocket as a weapon. I become tired. I come through a narrow window by ripping the walls out with my bare hands and barely squeezing through. I hide in a nearby clothes pile. They go on ahead of me, although they stop and look around for me for a moment. (427 words)

Bonnie and I are on a vacation, traveling. We meet this nice guy who shows us the backwaters of a lagoon. The water has debris and stuff in it like snake-like plants floating in it, etc. He says, "It used to be cleaner." We go to his cabin on the other side to visit. He gets food out, an egg, etc. for lunch. He and I like each other. We laugh and joke. It's fun, camaraderie. Bonnie gets sick. I sit with her and say, "If you were counseling someone who complained of pain like you do, what would you tell them?" I was trying to get her to be more objective. Then there is a big parade, with lovely Jamaican drums. I enjoy the beat. One of the gloats has a cook making spaghetti with hot sauce for Bonnie. I see Bonnie in the audience. We are sitting in pews. A woman says, "Wait, your turn is next." They bring the next float. It has a wedding cake on it. They announce sugarless cake for the guy and myself. I am pleased. I ask what they substituted. It was honey. I start eating. Mabel takes some of the honey away. She doesn't want me to eat too much at once and get sick. I remember eating honey on bread and not getting the irregular heart beat. It is really delicious. Co-worker Tyler is there, talking. Then I'm in a class. I choose a book of Elizabeth Taylor to analyze myself with. It's a study of contrasts, she's beautiful, successful, rich and sexually active... I'm the opposite of all that. There is a poem on the blackboard, something about zoo zoo's and I am trying to figure out the connection to me. (292 words)

I am conducting some sort of class. I tell the women to break up into three groups. One group is looking for jobs. Another group is looking for career and adventure, and a third group is genuinely wanting to be housewives and mothers. They each have a group project they are working on. I go to observe each group. As they use the tinsel-like materials to create something, I notice the housewife group wears lots of frills. Then the women are leaving and they haven't completed their task. I tell them to complete it. Each group hands me their project, almost finished. They look like fancy junky designs. I'm not pleased. Then I am swimming in a narrow channel. At first my strokes are only half completed. Then I stretch out and do each stroke correctly. I am going very fast, the water sparkling. My hands cleaving the water very sharply at each stroke. Now I turn to go back. The channel narrows until it is just a metal 2 inch strip that I am climbing up. It goes straight up very high and I get scared of heights. The two tracks meet and I have to let go of one to transfer to the other. I am scared and hardly want to let go for fear of falling. (219 words)

Only the XXX's live there. I ask directions of the man. Then I decide I need to change my clothes so I'll be better dressed for the interview. I put on a blouse and a skirt. Then Dovre says, "Look," and I notice that when I stand up, you can see through the skirt. In fact, my legs look real muscular and cute, with a bruise on the right side of the knee.

I have to go get a refill. In fact all my meds need refills. I go to the lady who does that, hoping to remember all the kinds of meds I will need. A. Woods is the lady. She's sort of a witch doctor type and dances around. These are rituals. We must spread a layer of dirt and then hay on top. Another strip of dirt next to that with apples on it. There is also a layer of sewing tools to be spread. I use a rake to do it. She tells us there is a fire for the angry ritual, which I have done before and need to do again. I resent that a little but do it. There is loud incantations and fiery happenings. (162 words)

There is a man that wants me back into a relationship with him. If I like the house, maybe I'll move back in, so he keeps checking with me to see if I like things. I travel through the rooms looking, not wanting to be back in the relationship. Too many bad, poor years. The house has many rooms. I start figuring out what each room is, a dining room, then a utility room for washer and dryer hook ups. I see a basement room. The man asks what I would put there, and I say, "The pool table."

I look for the syrup but I can't find it. Bonnie is my roommate. I say goodnight to her and start upstairs for bed. I remember I didn't check all the doors and windows to see if they are locked. I feel guilty. I go to each door and window and lock them. I then go upstairs and get in bed. I wake up because "Zippy" the dog is in and banging everything with his enthusiastic tail. I try to figure out why he's there. I hear noises and look out my window. A boy is stealing the car. At first I think it's the first boy that I had found earlier taking things out of the trunk of Bonnie's red car, but this is a different boy (like Anthony). I call him Rizzo. The car is brown, with the windshield broken out and the frame ruined. I worry now that Ellie had snuck out to help the boy, leaving us unprotected by not locking up the house. (209 words)

We have to jump from a very high bridge and swim a very deep and wide river. We poise to dive and we're scared. I make the bridge come lower and we jump in. It is very shallow and then after a few strokes it is very deep. We swallow a little water and struggle but we make it to the other side. (165 words)

I am angry and tell him not to do that! He should tell me where the place is. I'd get there probably faster than he could. He apologizes. It's my car. The marchers are behind the audience and they have sung and marched up the aisles to the stage. I suddenly realize there is no ramp but only stairs. The stage manager says he'll carry me. I reluctantly agree. We (the birds) go up the aisles singing the same song and as we get to the stage I see that R. has ramped it! We glide up to our places backstage. The marchers enter singing about how they have two feet and in bluesy notes we add that we have one and do the same things! It's an upbeat fun song. Rochelle forgets her lines and I cue her. It's Mark H., not Merle. It's a fun choreographed opening with walkies and wheelies working together. "We've got two feet and we can walk..." (stamp, stamp).

Jerome says, "You haven't got anything on me. I haven't signed anything." I say, "You wanta bet?" He's wary and surprised. Then I open the book and explain it to the audience. It's an innocuous book with little articles and cartoons. The damning pages are the horoscope pages. People have different colored symbols and they look up their meaning. Important decisions about people's lives are being made on those silly things. Someone's day is a green 8. They have a candle, an angel's smiling face, etc. (219 words)

I'm in a big bed and Mabel and I are all scrunched up on one edge. A big pillow is blocking us; my leg is hanging over the edge. I'm uncomfortable and about ready to fall. The pillow is my writing. I change to the other side of the bed and the pillow is there too. Then I am standing at the foot of the bed madly writing on an easel, nonsense words. I want to stop and rest but I am driven to write. (85 words)

I'm going over the hill to the community college on a racing bike. It's hard but I'm doing it, going up hill. Kids Paulina's age are pulling out, but I keep going on. A guy wants to use my repair kit. I'm willing, but don't know how. He gets mad at me. I tell him I have arthritis and this isn't my equipment. He gives up the race and goes back. I go on. Now I'm going down hill fast, curves, almost too fast, barely control the bike, now going up hill. I hear a male sleazy biker friend deciding to lay out his bed on the trail. I yell, "Get him off the trail or I'll run over him." I grab cigs on my way by, but they won't light or fall apart. The guys laugh because there was marijuana in one. It falls apart. I go on and against great odds I win! Exhausted but happy. (158 words)

Then I sit down at a table. I am sandwiched between two men, one is the one I refused. I start wondering why I turned him down, aware that it scares me to think of going out with someone. I leave. The other man follows me. He likes me and I am attracted to him. He doesn't ask me anything. He just engages me in conversation and I enjoy being around him. [BL] (115 words)

I notice they have remodeled their house. We go upstairs, passing another stairway going down. I am intrigued but don't go there. I see a window and outside, a push cart with books and gifts on it.

I am trying on the old-fashioned clothes of a "grandmother." My "grandfather" who loved her very much is sharing her with me. It's a very meaningful moment for me. I put on her "lawyer" dress. She wore it when she worked as a lawyer. It was lovely: white ruffles, a bustle, lavender silk. I tried on another dress. It was obvious I'm too plump. The swimsuit is very sexy. (69 words)

I'm in the chair. I drive it over a big desk and run it over the edge. I lightly land. Someone is astonished at that. I drive away. I see my cousin Abner; he's in church. I drive up next to his desk. The minister comes up and reaches under my dress and fondles my breast. I can't believe it's really happening because we are in full view of the church members. He talks his sermon as if nothing has happened. I just stare up at him surprised. Abner sneaks a note to me. It has Pete's address on it. 509. I ask what that means. Someone says it means "my fair lady." Later, Tyler talks to me about an adventure he had and how he told my stories. He has a piece of my Mexico dress around his neck. I receive a gift, a 3-D picture from the guys from Mexico. It starts transforming into a ferocious robot, but I have to hold it up because the legs were weak. Then it transformed back.

I am at my parents'. I am packing some things from a trip. A man likes me. He's arrogant. We all get in a van. He and I sit in the seat behind my father, who drives. The man and I cuddle. We kiss. It's pleasant, but I am aware he is emotionally distant, kissing me to "show" my father who's boss. Later, I am shopping. I see a man with a yellow shoe. He has it on his hand and is tap dancing with it. I am pleased and put on a pair, yellow satin. I tap dance. The man comes by and tells me to stop. He forbids me to tap dance. I am upset with him. I follow him to my parents house, rich, yellow color. Soft, we live there with my parents. I resent this.

There were spies. I became one. They had a secret message. The spy asked me how I could get to the roof restaurant. I said we'd take the elevator. I was pleased we'd go there together because it was ritzy and romantic. We got in the elevator. I was bandaged up like a mummy and my wheelchair was more like a "dolly" where I was standing. As we reached the roof area, fancy waiters watched us suspiciously. There were big gangster cats watching us. We go sit at a booth. I'm not bandaged now. He holds a message and asks how I shall get rid of it. I try to light a match to burn it. The matches go out or burn my fingers. Even after I finally burn the message, I have a lump of material left and have to figure out how to get rid of that. Part of the message was money. (155 words)

I was defending the Eskimo culture in a courtroom situation. It is the custom of the Eskimos not to bond or show love to their babies for the first year and a half because so many of them die. If they live, then they are loved a lot. There is a white man judge and lawyer who are trying to prove this is cruel and unusual punishment. I shout at them and call them names and argue eloquently and tell that I was an Eskimo for 1 1/2 years and then a white woman. So I can understand both sides. Later I am lecturing the Eskimos' parents to take better care of the babies. (114 words)

We then walk up another steep hill to see the beautiful idyllic country scenery. We walk through a cafe and I remember I don't know how to speak French. A woman suggests I speak German. I remember I can speak Spanish. I say, "Comer!" Later on the hill at sun rise I am delighted with the view and at my camera ready.

A small kitten is lying on my lap. I am amazed it can talk English! My grandfather Lloyd brings me a measuring cup with liquid in it. He says if I drink 4 swallows, take a pill, and rub some of the liquid on my wrist, I shall be able to hear and talk with my cat. I then notice there is a leak. I quickly swallow it, take the pill, etc. I call to my cat "Kathleen." She looks at me, but doesn't talk. I learn she prefers to be called Kathy. Then I go out with a friend to get into a small sports car. I unlock her door. She gets in and unlocks my door. It's hard to get in. The car is so small.

I'm painting a room, green. Some people interrupt me. They have information about the guilt of someone. They were witnesses to the burning of a Isuzu car. I leave my work to listen to them. I finally convince them to tell their story to the authorities. They won't go there in public, so I take them through a private corridor. It goes through a series of non-peopled spare bedrooms. "The first one," I tell them, "is where I go when I want privacy or quiet." After we go through a lot of them, I point out that this used to be a mansion. We get to the door. I instruct them to put on a oxygen mask, which is clear plastic and covers both the nose and mouth. I tell them not to be afraid. This is pure oxygen. We go into a chamber. The door closes. Water fills it up. Then the door on the other side opens into a under water world. I am immediately called to finish my hostessing chores before I can bring my witnesses to the authorities' notice. I swim out to take drinks to people, etc. The witnesses are seated at a table to eat. There is some confusion about how they can eat with their masks on so they won't drown. They work it out.

My friend comes back with an industrial kit to clean out toxins, etc. We'll have to vacate for hours. A bartender points out it's the wrong kit. We just need soap and water stuff. She goes back to exchange it. Now the bartender is a union musician who has to play any song requested. The manager comes over, saying she refuses to play two songs, Jingle Bells and one other.

She says "It's so hard to grow up," and I sigh, "I sure know what you mean." Then I put her down and we singing leaders march around singing. We stop. A black church group across the street teases us. The minister looks at our sexy evening dresses and yells, "What are you trying to do, make us throw a "mock" fit?"

I make it up as I go along and order them all about. I suggest they all take off their hats and alternate playing certain notes to play the most difficult part, which is a Chopin something which is soft and sweet. That's hard for a marching band to do, but my ideas accomplish that. There is much applause. Everyone is thrilled. I suggest we take it on the road. I am walking past a tavern or cage. All the patrons are talking about my magnificent ideas. I go in and sit next to my guy. I am very happy. Suddenly, we have a fight. He's not happy about my success interfering with our time. I feel very sad but prefer to leave him than give up my new successful life style. I go to the counter and get a note from the cook, Nate, that says he really likes me. I wink and smile at him, feeling good that some man still likes me. It means I haven't given up relationships altogether just because one guy isn't pleased. The cook gives me a box of food.

We curve around another way. I say it's o.k. even though I'm annoyed. I've made that mistake before too. Up here, turn right. I ask for my mail. He gives it to me and I open a small cardboard envelope that surprisingly has sexy black little bikini underwear. Another has a lace see through under skirt. I will it to be red. It slowly changes. I hold it up to me and I'm a little plump but I slowly change until I look sexy. The driver is smiling and asking what did I get in the mail?

He wakes up, sober, and crying out for his wife. He doesn't love me any more. He leaves. I'm hurt. I keep the car, but have no money. I pretend I'm wealthy. I look gorgeous in my blue evening gown of sequins and fringe, very form fitting. The guys stare at me lustily as I go by. I go to the back yard to take a morning swim. At first I can't find the swimming pool, only a shallow mud hole. Then I see it. I walk past the lovely buffet breakfast, take off two layers of slinky robes, to the enjoyment of the men that followed me from the inn. I dive in and swim back up to the surface. There are ropes across and I take one end, swim across and hook the rope both ends together. Now my way is clear so I swim. Later, I go back into the Inn. Someone says, "She can't pay," and they follow me up to my room. I fess up to them and offer to sell the car (which I feel uneasy about anyway because it could be considered stolen.) (260 words)

We do this by stepping on specially colored "tiles" or squares that are floating out in space. We get there, me stepping exactly where he had stepped before. The land likes to wear lots of bright, clashy colors together--purples, reds, blues, yellows, etc, all at once. I choose to wear only one color, turquoise and white. They are quite appalled.

A long journey through the night. At one point, I am in the back seat of the car, and no one is driving. We nearly hit a parked car! I crawl over the seat to get into the driver's seat.

I can't get my pants down. I call Bonnie and she helps. First, we peel off the bathing suit bottom. It is tight and painful. Then the regular panties and then the pampers diapers. Raul comes by and I'm embarrassed. He'll see the diaper. It comes off. Again, I'm backed into a corner, my hand shielding the genital area. Raul goes into the next bathroom and sits on the toilet. I can see his long legs sassily crossed over from under the curtain. He lifts the curtain up and smiles at me. I see a bathtub with hot water waiting. I say, "Is that a hot bath?" He says, "Yes. Why don't you join me?" I sigh and say, "I just think I might." Bonnie warns me not to. I would love to just relax in the tub with Raul's arms around me. Then some men walk in, looking for me. I crouch down into my corner again. A man tells me they need my help. His friend had a shooting accident and is going blind, but he wants to be a race car driver. The man is embarrassed and hides. I see his glasses with a bullet hole through it. I tell him, "If that's what he wants, then go for it. Do it! Find a way to make it work!" (263 words)

The rich guy and Jerome walk back and forth, standing very close and caressing. It's a very intimate relationship. Jerome goes to the window to look at the girl. He is standing too close to me. I am afraid he'll discover me. The rich man laughed seductively and teases Jerome about his gift to him (the sexy-looking girl). Jerome and the rich guy stand near the couch and kiss. I am afraid I'll sneeze or cough and they will find me. Then Jerome's wife comes in. She is shocked. She tries to eat a few potato chips Jerome has in a snack bag. He won't share. She's upset and pleads. "You won't even share food." Suddenly Jerome, leaning on the couch, sees me. He's angry and starts to kick me. I growl, "Don't you dare kick me." He stops.

It is necessary to throw out a small black and yellow bird that had traveled with us. I protest, " It will freeze." They'd throw him out and he'd fly back in. Once he landed on my hand, quite flat and exhausted. I felt sorry for him. They let him stay. My daughter drives too fast and I yell at her to slow down. She does. I tell her she is grounded for 24 hours because if I hadn't made her slow down, her passenger would have been squashed, nothing but her eyes bugging out, up in a corner.

I remember that Lydia and Ellie, Dovre and Paulina had come here too. I start to talk to the audience who are far away seated at tables. I say, "Everyone get up and go to the dance floor." Most do. I say, "Your only excuse is if you're dead, and I don't mean dead drunk!" They laugh. I turn to the musicians, "Hit it boys, some hot boogie." They play (piano, drums, bass, etc.) Boogie, I start singing and it's good. Ellie and another woman join in, 3 part harmony. It's great. Audience loves it, I love it, except I want to do it solo.

So I swam and swam and found myself on the bank of the river. I sat down on a white wrought iron sofa and the lecture began. A voice said that ironic though it was, they would show us the movie on TV screens so we won't miss out. Then this guy stood near a conveyor belt and created sound effects and so on. Once he showed us how he and a small kid that looked like a white curly-haired dog, would join in the action of the movie. Some sinister thing slunk through a blue velvet curtain. (174 words)

I go back to save things: a suitcase of clothes, books, my writing. I vaguely feel guilty because I'm only getting my stuff. I send Lydia in to get hers. (137 words)

Something's in the air. A change. Someone goes by saying, "Let's eat. Where's the grass?" Someone else laughs. That's all past. No more, meager veggie meals. Now it's meat! A man approaches a woman and offers her two fat volumes of some books and an empty baby seat if she'll make him a baby. People are making babies all over now because they feel strong and vital after so long. I am handed my plate. I am aghast. There is a live little brown furry animal on my plate, already garnished and cooked. "I refuse to eat live food," I say, quite disgusted and upset. Someone offers to cut it and chew it for me so it won't seem so horrible. I refuse. Then there is dancing. An energetic old white-haired man in a tweed suit claims me for the dance. I feel his strength and vitality. I smile shyly. He wants to kiss. (154 words)

It's Christmas and we are going to open our gifts, so we go to the ocean shore line. I think, "Oh, it will be unpleasant in the cold water, but only at first."

I had someone pick it up and put it on the bread board. There were worms there for it to eat. I wondered why I didn't put it in the drawer beneath it. (99 words)

I go back to the prison and sneak down the stairs hoping no one sees me. I see chickens in the cells. I make it to the front office and bravely walk straight for the front door. No one stops me.

I am a maid of honor at a wedding. The colors are black and white. A black curvaceous 1950's dress and long white veil. I walk up the aisle and notice the groom isn't there. He then enters from a side door. Part of the ceremony is for the groom to describe the future. He's a little embarrassed. He takes his ribbons and artfully waves them around and tells how they will be married for a number of years and then he'll fall in love with another woman and leave. He shrugs his shoulders and looks sheepish. He asks her if she's willing to continue, knowing that. She says yes. The bouquets are black flowers and ribbons. The next step of the ceremony is for everyone to light a small candle and, while singing, put their flame into the common or larger flame of the bride. I light my candle and follow the bride, singing, realizing with embarrassment that the song is "Rashneeshee" and my parents are probably shocked. I like the symbolism of all our little lights coming together in one large light. I drip my candle wax in the bowl. She smiles and points out it made a crooked pattern. [BL] (202 words)

Something male and dark is chasing me. A small boy, possibly my brother or someone I'm babysitting is on my back. I must protect him too. I run out of the house and up a tree, carrying the boy. His arms are wrapped tightly around me. As I climb up a rope to the tree, I see a huge black panther rushing out at me. Now I'm even in worse danger. I turn and run back toward the house with the panther hot on my trail. I run in and try to slam the door shut. I can't because the panther's claws are in my arm. I pull his claws out of my skin. It is painful. I force his paws back and then I slam the door shut on his front legs. I know this will hurt the panther, but I have no choice. I put the boy down and go to the window. I lay on a mattress and look up to the sky. I see a full moon and a cherub baby asleep on a cloud, or like the decals on my dresser that my mother put there when I was little. It looks like a child's book illustration, all cutesy. Suddenly I know that my mother is dead. I sob and sob my grief. I feel sorry I never really tried to get to know her. I am inconsolable. My crying wakes Ellie and Paulina who come to me and hug me. Ellie hugs me from behind. I feel her strong arms around my chest. I am at first sorry I woke them and then glad of their support.

She starts and I push her head gently away. Ellie comes into the room and starts talking to me. With immense relief, my mother is gone. I look up above my head on the way and see shoes and purses and lots of things precariously perched and ready to tumble down on me. I ask Ellie to help move some of the things.

I am a teacher and I am mildly interested in one of my students. I know it's not right, so I resist. He tries to interest me. In a fit of energy, I start to clean up the room. I get a broom and sweep Toostie O's on the floor. He also starts to help. We feel good about being responsible and taking care of business before pleasure. After it's clean, we (now my daughter Dovre and the young man) laugh and frolic together. I (a mature person) am pleased with them and approve of their actions. (97 words)

A cat hopped out of the refridge when I opened it. I say, "How did he get in there?" I notice Aunt Elaine left a bunch of miniature glass knickknacks out on the counter. I start to put them back in the cupboard. I see a movie video on the wall. It's a man floating in raging muddy waters and talking like a travelogue monologue. (65 words)

I am in a long room with a row of windows. I hear a noise and look out the window. A huge wave is rushing down the street. I slam the shutters to the window closed and the wave smacks up, getting us wet. This happens 2 or 3 more times. We'd hear the hissing sound and then the wave would smash on the window. Between waves I (without a body) go over to see the streets. I notice high water and see the red glowing lights from the nuclear reactor that went out, but is still hot. I hear a wave coming and rush back inside. Dylan and I run downstairs to better safety. We find a room with beds in it like a dormitory. I lay on top of him and we cling to each other. At first it is out of fear, but then a sexual feeling starts to build. He apologizes and I say, "No, it's o.k." I ask him if he's feeling bad for his wife. He looks sad and gently pushes me away. He suggests we just sit together. (185 words)

I am in a bed, sleeping. My cat pops up from under the covers. My children come in (teens). We discuss my getting up. Kenneth walks through the hall. I look up to see my cat walking upside down on the ceiling. The plaster was so thick he could get his claws in. I look for my clothes and remember they are in the bedroom across the hall. I look at miniature things. (73 words)

I am across the hall. I find a dress and a pair of undies in a dresser drawer. I hear the kids and Howard coming down the hall toward me. I look. They all march past in a single file, with dower faces on, especially Howard. He is followed by a little boy named Dwight wearing an expensive, white, embroidered shirt. Paulina tries to help me take off my shoes and knee high socks. I laugh and say, "You're not much help!" (In the previous dream with cat, I remember that I hadn't made love to my husband Howard for years. I feel a little bad and think, "Oh well, maybe I'll start." The very next thought was, "No! I won't do that!") (123 words)

I am a young (18 years old) swimmer on a team. I am very good; I'm Olympic material, in fact. My coach and I are falling in love, but aren't yet to the stage where we can speak about it. I am jealous of his attentions to another young woman. I swim in a race and lap all the others. I am so good. In fact, I beat the male champion! I then show the governor's wife how to stand properly on the thing that we start the race from. My coach says, "So that's how you get your strength. No one else uses the stance that way." (108 words)

I'm a little afraid of them. They have a son who likes me. We kiss, French kiss. He asks me if I've had a lot of men. I say, "No, I'm a virgin." He's very glad. I then notice that she has a shop in her living room -- a witch's shop with packaged spurs and so on. I need to leave. (62 words)

A man and I are in a car. He wants to kiss me. I say, "Well, let's see how you do." He kisses me. I agree that it is pleasant and ask him to promise that if I make love to him, he won't start demanding that we do it a lot, like Howard did every night or at least every 2 nights. He agrees, but I have doubts. (69 words)
Barb Sanders:#0838 (06/28/86)

A man offers me a present. We agree to make love and I say, "You don't have to give me a present." After we are finished, he suggests I look in the pockets of his raincoat for my present. I am relieved he still wants to give it to me. It's rhinestone jewelry. I find other presents he will give other women. I smile. (64 words)

A man named Keith likes me and comes on sexually. I am drawn to him. Our lips nearly meet and I suddenly pull away, still wanting him but confused. I say "No. I am married." He smiles and says, "You want it; why don't we go away? There are lots of big rooms with fireplaces." I am tempted, but refuse and pull away. He starts to leave and I realize that I am not married and regret rejecting him, but it is too late. [BL] (84 words)

I am looking for a bus stop to go to the community college. I have forgotten my purse and wish I had it so I could buy some ice cream. I am with a nice young man. We are walking and I suggest going to 11th Street or 18th Street for a bus, but we keep passing them. I suggest 30th Avenue and he agrees. We go down a curvy road. He says, "Just a minute," and ties a rope around my knees, binding my legs together. He undoes the belt and a few buttons of my jacket, exposing my middle, then he steps up behind me and picks me up to carry me. I thank him and ask if this is too much for his back. He agrees this is better for his back, carrying me this way. We take a wrong turn and I point it out to him. We are going up the country road to the TV or radio station tower on the hill. We stop and see some houses. We see a plump, mean-looking man seated on his porch. He is eating leaves and a live frog. He comments that he's eaten a lot of leaves! He's so poor. I am disgusted and look away. My friend asks for the way to the bus stop. He says "Oh, that way, about 11 mile walk." I say, "Oh no! I guess we won't make the 12:50 bus." We start to walk. Now we pause. We are sort of in a house. At least the road is blocked by a wall with doors and windows. There is a picnic lunch there. I see sweet gray kittens eating fried chicken. They are growling and I hear an awful grinding noise as they up and eat the chicken. Then I see a horrible thing. It is holding a miniature woman upside down by the ankles and is milking her body of all its life force and fluids. Her face is swollen, red and pained. I turn away. It is too horrible to see. The old man has followed us and he says to me, "You shouldn't talk to strangers." I thought he meant my friend and I laugh. I look up to see my friend preparing to lunch on another upside down miniature woman. I am sickened and now scared. I see the old man lock the door. He and another old man pretend to have a gun fight with exaggerated back-to-back and drawing-out-of-the gun movements. I know now that I am trapped here with all these men and they are going to have their way with me and then eat me. I am sick with fear. (448 words)

I have a cave man art store, pottery, rickety wooden shelves, mud floor. It's not good enough yet, so I suddenly shift into another time dimension with my art works and wait. Then I push rock slides into the cave and time beats it into a solid rock foundation. I come back and now my store has beautiful carved items of obvious high quality. I have a pool of water that works as a mirror. People call it magic. It is still prehistoric times. I do a thriving business. Carved stone and glass leopards and statues on the shelves. (99 words)

An Uncle is going to end it all by blowing himself up. I feel sad and then nonchalantly decide to do it myself and set the bomb for 12:00. At about 8 minutes before it's to blow up, I am quite calm but decide to not die. I am talking to my "mother-in-law" on the phone and leave her mid-sentence to stop the timer. Now I am safe. I go to see my Uncle to convince him to live. He (now my Cousin Abner) agrees and says he'll move in with me. I am delighted, although even as I'm saying there is plenty of room, I see all the beds full. Now I'm on a huge carnival ride on the top of a tall building. I am terrified. It slings me about as I cling as hard as I can. I feel sick with fear and think, "If this is adventure and fun, I don't want it." (157 words)

Fluffy has a kitten. It keeps trying to nurse and gets taken away and put back. Finally, it is announced that the baby isn't going to make it and I must see it and say cafe. At first it is a fibrous mass and then it is a huge hard-boiled egg, sans shell. I hold it in my hands. The smooth slippery surface feels slightly icky and yet I am fascinated or drawn to it. It is the size of an ostrich egg or uterus. (85 words)

I am at a swimming pool. I am afraid of the water. I had had a frightening and hurtful experience in the water (an attack of some sort, possibly rape). The coast has most of the swim team (24 of them) benched so I have the pool to myself. I start to swim. I am fast and enjoy it. My coach is very impressed. I am a world class champion. He marvels that I can be se good in the element where I experienced so much trauma. (87 words)

I am sitting on a bench and trying to gather up leaves. I am going to crochet the leaves into a lovely blanket or tablecloth. The leaves will be the material I use to crochet the already done squares of intricate pattern using crochet thread. I think to myself that it is silly to do that because the dried leaves are so brittle that they will break up into thousands of little pieces and blow away. A good-looking, very friendly man sits next to me. He engages me in conversation. Each time I turn my head toward him to respond, his face is closer. He's teasing me into permitting him to kiss me. My body leans far to the left as he leans into my "space." I look over to my left, at my sister Lydia. We smile at each other like acknowledging what a bizarre situation we find ourselves in. I know I need to tell him to stop. My non-verbal messages aren't doing it, but I feel loathe to do so. Finally, he does kiss me and I gently push him, giggle and say, "Don't do that," and drop eye contact. He does stop and backs off. Now we are preparing a lunch basket. I look and all I'm getting is packages of hot dogs and left over sausages that are old and wrinkled. I remember there are nicer cuts of meat and wonder a little angrily why that wasn't evenly divided. I was getting the worst end of the deal. (253 words)

I have a small kitten. I put some milk into a bowl for it. At first, I have trouble finding a bowl. I don't want to use the three we always use. The kitten lunges for the milk. It is so thirsty. The bowl changes into a crocheted doily and the milk sinks through. Then I see a movement like a snake moving off a chair and then I see a rat sneaking up behind the cat and it's going to bite it. I throw something at it and approach. It runs out the door. I follow and slam the door shut to scare it and then I open the door and peek around. The rat is now a man. I call out to the door guard to watch out. Another man walks up the stairs and I don't want him to go any further until he's been checked out. Then a snake-like column of smoke or fog moves through the stairs. (162 words)

I am called to leave with Mabel and Orville. I turn at the door just before I go in and see members of the Counseling Department waving. I feel sad because the end of the world is coming and we will all die. I call out, "I love you," and turn to go. I am a little embarrassed and say, "I suppose it's corny, but it was my last chance to say it to them." We go inside the house. My Uncle Joel calls me to the other room. I am hesitant because I'd already put my stuff in a bedroom. I go into the living room and sit on a couch. Leroy is there and there is instant attraction and warmth. He sits next to me, very close, and puts his arm around me. I know this is wrong, but I want it. I struggle with my conscience a little, but it's a foregone conclusion. He complains bitterly how he never measures up to his father's expectations. A stray kitten and a cousin. It's a double reason to stay away, but I love being near him. I feel warmth and excitement. Both Uncle Joel and he assure me they are still working on marketing my script. I am a little annoyed and frustrated. [BL] (214 words)

Jennifer H and I are in a living room. She points and says, "Oh look." I look and see a man has walked in and sat on our couch, without permission. I can tell he's a "stray kitten." I walk over to him and say, "I wish you would leave. This is our house and you weren't invited." He pleads, laying on a guilt trip. I don't pay any attention. I assist him up and walk him to the door and say goodbye firmly. (84 words)

I am in a house setting, but it is a hospital of some kind. I am going back in and am wondering why I am. A nurse comes up to me and starts yelling. She's cold and mean, calling the patients bastards. I start yelling at her, calling her a "son of a bitch." She's coming at me with medication. She says, "If you don't take the pill, I'll give you a shot." I fight her, holding off her hand with the needle. I run, escaping. I grab slices of roast beef as I leave and eat them because I haven't eaten in awhile and will not be able to eat for awhile longer. I hop on a horse and gallop away up into the hills. We walk in the stream for awhile to cover our tracks. We find a tree. I build a hide-out of boards and moss. (149 words)

Now it's Dwight in the tree and my mother, my father and I are looking for him. We notice the tree is close to a small town and near the coast highway. How clever we think. My mother, my father and I go into a shop and look around. Suddenly we realize we are in someone's home and they are at the door about to come in. We go hide in the bathroom. I'm pushing my mother because she's embarrassed and doesn't know what to do. (86 words)

Hello again! Dream cycle has started again! I go into a woman's house. She has large white onyx cat statues all over her house. One is glued to the drapes as though he is walking down the drapes, head first. I am amazed they can do that, it being so heavy. I see two cat statues curled up under a table. They are the same as the ones under my TV. She also has pretty red and ornate vases. The woman approaches me and asks angrily, "Why are you in my house?" I answer, embarrassed that I was looking at garage sales and stopped to admire her lovely cats and vases. She coldly tells me that she's not having a garage sale. So I leave, asking her if she knows the way to the county fair. She doesn't know. I get into a car. Hank is driving. We are unsure where the fair is, but think it's to the right. Hank suddenly grins and starts driving backwards uphill. I say, "Oh, did you figure out where the fair is?" The scene changes. We are in an outdoor scene, but it is all enclosed in a sky-scraper kind of building. There is an ocean and I watch as the water is being sucked way, way out to sea. Now, there's trouble, because that means we're about to experience a tidal wave. I see it coming and run for high ground, scrambling over rocks. I then keep climbing up, sometimes rocks, sometimes stairs. I need to find the car, which I can't see, but know it's somewhere. I will it to be there and see a small toy car under a table. I then get in it, it's regular size now, I drive down the stairs looking for the first floor exit. I see windows and look out. I see large expanses of flooded land and a car driving down a road. I ask someone how to get there. They say, "Why bother, you can't go far anyway because of the flooding." (340 words)

I am on a bus and look up into the sky. I see a white, streaky cloud like vapor trails of an airplane. It is sweeping around in a circle like a sonar screen would. I realize then that I have stumbled on a secret information and the Russian spies are going to be after me. I pretend I don't know anything about it and look around. I see my father and someone on a bench. I start walking toward a building that has display squares all over its front. I see cats sitting and standing in the squares, only their backs are to me. I think that's a little rude and embarrassing (all those asses). I continue walking and come full circle back to the bench. Trouble: the spies have replaced my father and are seated on the bench.

Jake and Valerie and I are in a car. I'm in the back seat. I see the landscape go by. I see buildings, including some that are just being constructed. I comment on one. I notice the streets are flooded. Then we come to an intersection. A parade is coming to the same intersection across from us. Jake is annoyed. I say, "Let's watch the parade." He growls out that he'd rather drive on. He turns so that we are now in the parade! I am somewhat embarrassed. He pulls across the road and into a parking lot and then we drive to his house. I see a grandfather clock with strange symbols inside it. I say to Valerie, "Oh, I see you got that clock." She says "Yes." She also got each of us a program that fits into the clock and proceeds to demonstrate my program. (148 words)

More flooding waters. I run for the elevator to go down to the basement. I can't because the basement is all flooded. I reluctantly must go up. I see Dickie. He is looking at a TV set. I come over and face him, and peer at the TV. I see war and pain and confused people. I burst into tears and cry for the sad, confused people. I am surprised and touched that Dickie is crying just like me. He reaches out and hugs me. He tenderly touches my hair and says, "I didn't know you had such soft hair." (100 words)

I work for an old man who is rich. He keeps a rigid schedule so when we aren't on duty upstairs we go downstairs and live our own life. I am surprised how free and fun people are downstairs and wonder how they dare because if the old man found out he'd be angry and fire them. There is a dance. I am dancing near an open door to the outside. I think what would really happen if I escaped. I know he's said there are terrible things out there. On an impulse, I suddenly run outside. People are shocked and concerned. I'm a little scared. Nothing happens. I imagine a snaky tentacle touches my ankle. I run back into the house. Then I see a giant building loom up over the wall and look in. It's the monster. I think, "How can a building hurt me?" I leave again. I get into a car and think, "I'd better take another street out of here." I look to my left and see smoke from a big fire. Then I remember that my parents and Judy are still in the building. I can't leave them. A courthouse building slides out toward the street to get me. I feel threatened, but go in anyway. I drive up fast and see Judy rush from work. They are escaping in another car. I drive up to them and they are so scared they don't know it's me. We drive in a circle, me chasing them running. I yell, "Look, it's me." Finally she recognizes me. I ask where my parents are. They are in the back seat. (273 words)

I decide to go visit Ellie. It's only a few blocks away. I walk over to her apartment. The door sill is up about 4 feet. I wonder how I'm going to get in. Andy helps me in. Ellie is very busy in and out of the room and I sigh because I shall have to spend time with Andy as he is holding the baby. I'd feel more comfortable with Ellie, but can't get her to slow down enough to take the time. I decide Andy is o.k. I play with the baby. Ellie comes by with another baby she is babysitting. Something is very wrong with his eyes. One is larger and strangely formed. He even has eyeballs in his mouth. His name is Chris. A woman drops by to arrange a time with Ellie to watch her baby. They leave. I look at Andy, who now is all brown with black hair and blue eyes. He tells me he is a Maui from Hawaii. I ask, "What percentage?" He says, "100%." I notice that I am prejudiced and try not to be. I then think, with some regret, that their child will only be half white. I then shrug my shoulder and try not to let that matter. (211 words)

I go into a public restroom. I notice that both men and women are using the same room because the men's room is temporarily closed. I find a stall, no doors. My friend and I are talking. A man comes up and comments on my shoes and I try to ignore him. He follows me out of the restroom. He likes me and wants to get together. I carry straw flowers and a strawberry. I throw away the strawberry. He is very happy and says, "Oh look. She threw away his strawberry and kept my straw flowers." Somehow that means I favor him. So I go into a room and sit down at a table. My friend also sits with me. The man, tall and good looking, appears and stands behind me. I am now in a quandary because I realize that my friend had seen him first and wants him. She goes away, hurt, and I see a small pet animal curled up with bruises near its eyes. (169 words)

I am seated in a chair with a man. We are watching a Chinese play involving a woman who discovers another woman who is rich is her cousin. She tries to tell the woman of the relationship and is rebuffed. It's all in Chinese. I try to interpret it for the man. The play stops in the middle. A woman (Chinese) says they should never have attempted to pretend to be on TV. So it's time to cleanup our picnic mess and go to our hotel room. I am surprised to notice that I am sexually interested in the possibility of going to bed with him. I think, "Well, that's unusual," and agree that if the feelings go away, then I won't, but if the feelings stay, we'll make love! Then I get domestic and clean up his area and then go to my kitchen and clean up. I am surprised again that I can do this. It feels pleasant. I cut up hot dogs and stuff them with more hot dogs and put them in baggies. I offer him a lemon meringue pie, asking if he likes them. He says "Yes, but what about the cherry pie we bought?" I didn't have to go to that trouble. I laugh and say, "Let's invite the other couple over and help us eat it." (223 words)

A young woman and her husband and baby live out in the woods. They all sleep together in a sleeping bag under the trees. Now they've built a house. It has no furniture. It is only one room. I look inside and my voice is like a narrator on a TV show pointing out the features: a solid floor that has insulation underneath, a piece of green-yellow carpet on one half of the floor. The walls are handcrafted stained glass windows to shine beautiful colors with the sunlight. I try to make them look more beautiful. A roof to keep off the cold winter rain. The side wall opposite me opens up so that I see a porch with people on it, and a lovely view of the meadow and the river. People are swimming in the river. I have to sit up tall to see them over the rocks. (150 words)

I feel somewhat embarrassed and want to explain to her that I mean no harm. I'm not trying to take her husband away. I don't say anything. Then I get up and walk over to my "date." It's Pat Brown. He's wearing a sweater that had been cut in a semi-circle and his chest skin was cut too. He remarked it had been dome by a chainsaw and it sure hurt! He repeated a groaning "Ow!" several times! He seemed surprised at his stupidity of letting himself get cut. [BL] (122 words)

I am thinking that I want to or should go to the library in S City. Bonnie comes by and we go in her car. It's a small old green Volkswagen. Others are in the back seat. I'm in the passenger seat. When we get to S City, I ask Bonnie, or rather hint to her, that I'm not sure of what to do and would she help me. Bonnie/Corinne says, "You can do it," and tells me to push the "county" button on the phone and dial 514 ----. I try to, but can't find that button. Two other categories are added: "cars" and "driving." A woman comes on the line and asks me what I want. I say that I want the library. She asks me if I am B. She recognized my voice. She is Cheryl S and then I'm at the library. She is very pregnant. She suggests we take some time out to enjoy ourselves by going swimming. The old lake has been paved. So now we are in a boat, a small motor boat, blue and white. Bonnie is driving and messes up by driving us up out of the water and onto the lawn. There is a row of apartment houses and I'm concerned that they will come out, mad at us for being on their lawn. I notice how close they live to the lovely swimming pools and think how nice. I drag the boat back into the water. It is damaged on the aft side and starts to fill up with water and sink. I pick it up, now small and a "handbag or plastic carry bag" and empty the water. I take things out of it and use it to float on like water wings. I float along. I notice the pretty turquoise tiles on the floor of the pool and see walls covered with arts and crafts. I want to kick to get exercise which is good for my health, but don't because I might splash other people and they'd get mad. Then I see all the water is gone and a sign says that from the hours of --- and ---, swim in the other pool. I walk to the other pool and see a long, long flight of stairs. It leads down into a huge room like in mansions. There are a huge grandfather's clock, antique crystal glass flowers on a brass wall lamp, a series of dolls and oil paintings. Then I see lots of people taking their places, in costume, for a historic pageant which will start when the water comes on and fills up the pool. I lean my hand on the stair rail which is broken and shakily leans out over the long fall. I back up and feel nervous so close to the edge. Paulina sits next to me on my left. We move to another vantage point near another rickety rail. An Indian man walks past me and goes down to be a part of the pageant. I am intrigued by the Indians and watch as he opens a beaded pouch. He opens a bag and there are blankets and jean jackets. (531 words)

I am in a pickup truck in the driveway of Aunt Elaine's house and it starts sliding backwards. It rolls across a busy street and into the driveway across the street. I press and press on the brakes. It finally stops. I watch the traffic, which is fast and thick, for an opening so I can go back to Elaine's house. I watch one person passing another recklessly and think, "How dumb." Finally I get across. I want to take a shower, but I tell someone that Arvonne lives in the house now and I'd have to ask her. That seems an impossible task "You know Arvonne." I shrug my shoulders.

I am in the kitchen of Aunt Elaine's house. I am moving in and so is Diane R. I am putting food stuff away. Cookies, candies, etc. I comment to Diane that I will need lower shelves so I can reach things. Two workmen come and do something out in the barn. Now I go from room to room to decide where to put my bedroom and office. I walk through two bedrooms, the front one had a small room off it. It had a small cat and a wild and ugly turkey bird in it. I say, "Ugh! How did you get in?" He follows me. I wonder if Elaine used this room when she wanted to sleep alone. I go to the dining room. Diane is putting away her dishes in the pretty glass cabinet in the wall. I say, "Wait. I have some pretty things I want to display too. We should share this equally." She smiles and says "Or 60, 90." Now we are in the living room and I say "I have a TV, stereo, and a VCR." Diane says, "I have a VCR and a clock-radio." Her voice is soft and I ask her to speak up as I can't hear her well. I suggest we use my couch. She says, "I've seen your couch. I'd rather use mine." I say, "Where is it?" She points. It is rickety, ugly, yellow and low to the ground. I say, "I can't sit on this because it's too low." We negotiate. Diane asks me 3 times, but I can't hear her. She's embarrassed. Finally I understand that she's on welfare and I need to write a statement that I haven't given her money. Then Ginny comes in and sits down. I'm eating a sweet sticky chocolate. She mumbles and I ask her to speak up. She's concerned that the 2 workmen will try to cheat me and warns me not to pay them. They took a covered glass dish and didn't pay for it. both ways.

I am cleaning the cupboards out in a kitchen. I throw away some old food, apples, shredded wheat with lots of sugar in it, open noodle packages, etc. A man comes to the house. He has a gun and he intends to kill me. He's a hit man. I pull out a rifle, which I can see, but I aim it at him and tell him I'll shoot. He laughs. He's confident I haven't the guts. I do fire, at his hands, or arms. I don't want to kill him. I just want him to stop trying to hurt me. He's surprised, but not worried. He pulls out a knife and threatens me. I shoot again. He's not hurt or affected. I turn and run -- to hide. Outside is a big bushy tree. I climb up and hide in the bushy part. I worry that he'll figure out my strategy, or that I made a dumb mistake staying so close by. I figure he'd figure that I took off fast. He does see me in the tree. I wasn't still enough and birds chattered and flew around, giving me away. He's going to force me to go into this dark hole, to my death. I turn and dive into the hold in an attempt to outsmart him. Either I'll kill myself trying to escape or I'll outsmart him. I free-fall a long way and end up in a basement. I turn to the left, and go down several flights of stairs. I find a tiny door with small knobs. It's a dumb waiter. I almost cry in frustration because I can't get the door open, and then it opens and I crawl in and hand pull myself back up to the ground level. I'm wondering if I made a mistake. I go to a hotel and sign in with a fake name and go to my room to rest. As I sit, I notice with horror that my own personal brand of shampoo is in the room and I know he has found me! I pull aside the shower curtains and he is there -- dressed up and nice. He has brought me a present. He hands me a baby. It is my "ex-husband" by another woman. I think the baby is cute and start to feed it. I get the feeling the guy wants to marry me. (399 words)

I am an important person, maybe a princess. I am in a wheelchair and go out for a walk. I am surrounded by reporters and gawkers that crowd around me and get in my way. They are shouting questions. I am aloof and angry. I intimidate them. They want to rush forward and help me, but I stare at them and they don't dare. We go to a store. I look in a window and see food. I choose an apple and an apple juice. Then I notice I've chosen both of the same kind. I go inside to pay. One reporter is nice and sympathetic. I notice him. As I leave the store, there are 2 or 3 stairs. The crowd is wild and wants to help. I snap my chair around and yell, "If you don't get out of the way, I'll twirl around and you'll get hurt. This is a warning." I then twirl around and go down the stairs backwards. I go on down the street. I see a big beautiful old house, cream-colored with huge, sturdy and ornately carved beams and columns. It is now divided into apartments, but it once was an elegant home. The nice man says, "It is beautiful. Do you like it?" I breathe, "Oh yes." I try to look in the windows. He says, "How would you like the windows?" I say, "Big and airy, but in the back. I like the smaller ones in the front." He nods. I see inside, fireplaces, pools and lovely fountains and tile work. A woman sits by a big window. I go on down the street. I see two women. They are old friends of the man. I am holding a baby. I say to the woman, "Here. Hold the baby and pat it and kiss it like I've seen you do. The baby needs it." She takes the baby, but they are too rough and uncaring. I ask for the baby back. I say, "If you can't do it right, then I'll do it." I kiss and caress the baby softly. The man is tender as he looks on. I like him and feel feelings of friendship and camaraderie. My father comes over and explains how people become royalty. They all started out as regular people and then are knighted. My father tells the man to go with him and he will knight him. (402 words)

I am leaving the house for work and notice that I am 4 months pregnant. I am surprised. At the age of 44, it seems odd. It is also a little pleasant. I try to figure out who the father is. I am a little disappointed that it's not Nate. Maybe it's one of the two Pats. I go to work. I am depressed and keep to myself as I work. I go to the lunch room and see a newspaper article of Delta S. I try to point it out to the others, but they pay no attention to me. I eat chocolate chip cookies and toast with honey. (110 words)

I am maybe in a hospital setting. There are helpless, newborn babies being badly taken care of. Michael J. Fox grabs my hand and pulls me, running through the corridors. I am concerned because I am hooked up to the babies and our running is pulling out their life support system and causing them pain and then death. I feel I must do something. It is suggested that I talk with the top authority, Governor Goldsmith. I waver and think, "Oh, I'll just mention it to some local person. The message comes clearly! "DO NOT WAVER! Go to the top. Top priority! You must save the babies because horrible things are being done to them! They are used for experiments. Pieces are taken out of them before they are dead and people say they can't feel pain but they can! You must help them!" I must help them! Also a naked man was in the bed next to me. [BL] (159 words)

I am on a beach, romping. I see a violin case in green and yellow (University colors). It is there for me. I had written a letter requesting it from a music professor so that I could create a better, more creative Happy Birthday song for someone. He felt I could do a good job, so he brought it and left it on the beach to surprise me. And I was surprised. I wasn't sure it was for me. I circled it and exclaimed at my friends. I touched it and it's duck-like mouth opens and gently bites my hand. I decide it's for me and pick it up and go to the parking lot and sit in a van and play. My fingers are deformed, so I must hold it differently. I am rusty. I know the professor is listening. I hope he's not disappointed. (146 words)

Mabel is organizing some group of musicians for a rehearsal. She calls me over to her to explain what's happening. She's seated and facing a stage with musicians and singers on it. I lean over so that her hair is touching my face. I enjoy that soft, intimate moment, aware that if she noticed what I was doing, she'd withdraw. She tells me she must work with the main group and asks if I would meet with a small group of them to explain non-musical details. The person designated to do that didn't show up. I agreed and went over to one side to meet my group. They are on the stage and so I go over there and quietly listen in as they are talking. A curtain is between us. They say how nice it is that the Ricatta Inn is lowering their rates for the seven of them. It is better than having to walk so far to the YWCA. Now, maybe next year, more people would have heard of the lower rates and will sign up. One woman peeks down at me from the curtain "Are you a sophomore?" she asks. I say, quite surprised, "Oh no. I'm..." I couldn't remember what year I was. Then I remember. "I'm a graduate student. And then I've been going to school at the community college. This is my last term. I guess I'd better find out what I'm going to do for the rest of my life as a job." I feel a little startled and scared. I'd been drifting along, going to school and taking it easy. Now I had to think about real work. (277 words)

I am in the back seat of a car. My father is driving. Ellie, Paulina and Charla are in the back with me and my mother is in the front. I look to my left and see two red limos driving. I peer into one and see an older woman. I recognize her as a famous writer. I am quite thrilled and roll the window down and stare at her. She looks up. I take Charla and hold her up saying, "Look. Isn't she cute?" The woman passes a note to me. I feel the wind between the cars, grab at it and hang on tight. I then read it. It is in very small writing and is a list of some kind. It also has her name and address on it. It also says, "You have talent." I feel very happy. Her car speeds up and goes ahead of us. She's now in the back trying to say something to me. I can't make it out but it feels important. I tell my father to speed up so I can see her lips. He starts to and then sees a bridge up ahead and slows down. He's afraid that bridge goes into New York City and he turns left. I see a sign that says "Permanent Terminal." I am very agitated and demand that my father stop the car. He's telling Paulina and others to get out and watch for traffic. I hop out quickly and push him out of the driver's seat. My mother is yelling at him. I get in and say, "I'm not afraid to drive through New York City." I turn us back to the freeway and speed up to catch up with the woman. (290 words)

And have done it. I am thinking of biking to T City and then go home. I ask how long it will take. 6 or 7 hours! Too long. I explain that I won't go to T City; just home.

A woman takes us in to show us around. I see a window and look. I see a family at leisure down in the family room. I go down there. I notice a lovely babbling brook going through the room and comment on it. She is pleased as it is unique and beautiful. She takes me to another building to see the clothes. As I enter, I see it's a restaurant. It's a surprise party for "Kathy" who isn't there, one of the family members but I don't remember which one. I keep asking where's Kathy. No one really knows. I eat chocolate chip cookies that are mushy and undercooked. I leave to go find the university. I see one across the street. I walk uphill and go in a building. I see Jerome.

I create more little cars like me so that people are more on the alert. I go pretty slow at first and then speed up. I fly over the cars going slower than me.

I feel guilty. Then I move away and go talk to a woman who is talking to her counselor. She instructs me to place my hand on her debit card hump which is a lumpy skin patch on her left shoulder. She tells me it is there so that when people touch it, she will experience pain.

We get lost. I am cleaning out a trunk, but somehow end up keeping most of the stuff, even though I know I needn't. I keep a clear plastic compartmentalized box I had removed things from. I keep a set of keys that unlock someone's car. It has a small gas key on it. It's round and metal and says BUS on it. It changes to BUE. I couldn't figure out who it belonged to, so I tucked it in the back of Grandma Agnes' built-in hutch for dishes, silverware and tablecloths. I find Christmas cards I had been writing and suddenly realize it's May and the information will be outdated by Christmas. It's a waste of time. I keep them in the trunk.

I pick him up in my arms and carry him to a hospital. Another man who sort of likes me comes along on my right. I notice there is a chain safety pinned to him and to me. It has a sign on it, "Gay Lover." I am surprised and then notice it is attached to the man I am carrying and not to me. Apparently we need the sign there to fool the authorities so we can get the man to help. I put him on the counter in front of the nurse. I notice I put him down gently because the surface is hard and it bumps his head. I turn him over on his side and let the sea water run out of his mouth as proof for the nurse. He starts breathing.

I saw a lot of miniature desks lined up. They belonged to Cherry T. I opened one drawer and saw a diary book, about joy. I apologized for looking at her private material. [BL] (65 words)

The Birds are preparing for a performance. I notice that Merle looks very good-looking. I wonder why I hadn't noticed that before. He offers for us to have a finale dinner after the 2-day show at the expense of his poetry club called Beef o'Poetry. Just as he offers it, two other offers come in. A dance teacher, Lucy, who I call Vern, offers a night out for dinner. I put my arm around her and pat her shoulder when I call her name, "Vern." Merle is a little annoyed. Lucy is there. Later after the show, I see a room where lots of leftover food has been put on two tables. I want to use up the food so it won't go to waste. I carry out carrot sticks, relishes, and biscuits and butter to place on a table where Dwight of Counseling and Hank and other people are. I start to put the basket down, and I see a huge tray of biscuits, so I move my stuff further down the table because I want it to be eaten and not come back to me or go to waste. (191 words)

I see Howard's scales and I want to stand on them to weigh myself. I notice that the scales are a book with a plastic protective cover on it. The real scales are underneath. I am in a house and I look for Howard to ask him a question. I am concerned because I can't remember paying the rent or the insurance for several months and wonder if he did. I paid the other bills but there's not much money left. He says he has paid the other bills and I feel relieved. A boy and a baby girl come romping up to me. They are my children. The little baby girl starts to nurse. I feel somewhat embarrassed and think, "Hey, there's no milk. I'm dried up." (128 words)

I am on a ski boat thing where you stand up on the thing and it acts like a motorcycle. The waves are huge and violent. I like it. Then I'm on a lake, placid and large. I am trying to catch up to "the big boys." I pass many brightly colored balls in the water as I speed with a single-minded desire after the "big guys." I am catching up to them. (73 words)

I must become more aware of the kinesthetic. I notice my left leg. I am picking up my car. It's been repaired. Now I go to pick up some foreign student who will come live with me and want to drive my car. When I pick him up, there is some confusion. I want to turn on the radio and get some news. A plastic cover (like over Marilyn's cake) is over the control knobs. I twiddle with the knobs and get an occasional weak light on. I focus on channel 12. It is a TV news station. The foreign student doesn't want to live with me, but does want to borrow the car. I feel uncomfortable with this and refuse. He is miffed. (124 words)

A tall good-looking man enters. He has come with a bus load of kids. They have all been saving their food and money to afford this escape to where I am. They have heard of how well I did and want to do the same. I quietly stand in front of him, facing him. It feels good and calm. I like him. He likes me. He is different from the others. (He looks like the conductor I met at the coast, Tony Amour.) The welfare people need my report and because I was honest, they have to take away a couch in my parent's home. I have a small girl with me. (112 words)

I am in bed and having a restless, tossy turny night. The man I love is chasing to be with another woman. I am jealous and upset. I see blood spots on the mattress. I had started my period. I wake up. The blankets are all wrapped up around me in the middle of the bed. Burt Reynolds, my man, and his new lady come into the bedroom. I'm glad I'm covered. They go into the kitchen. I crawl under the bed to pick up my writings (maybe diary) that had fallen to the floor as I slept. I see underpants there too and chose an old white pair that won't bind me at the legs. I get dressed and go to the kitchen to pour my breakfast cereal. She is there. We are snotty to each other. I pretend it doesn't matter to me. I start to eat my cereal only to notice it's quickly gone and pour in some more. (It's shredded wheat miniatures like I had at the coast.) I then look up and notice lots of ants marching across the living room floor in a line. I comment on them and think about stepping on them. As I watch, they change to small dolls marching to the Christmas tree. The dolls keep getting bigger and bigger and some fall down and then pick themselves up. I go to the Christmas tree. It is like Grandma Agnes's living room. Aunt Charlotte and I pass a present by the wall on the right. I hear Lydia behind me saying, "I'll just sit out the first part because we couldn't afford to buy a present." We sit in a group near the tree. I then hear loud crying and I'm in a movie theatre. The woman in front of us is crying. She turns her head away from the screen so I can see her more clearly. Tears are flowing copiously to the point the back of her movie seat is getting wet! She's saying, "My mother. It's so sad. She died." I then notice her kissing and hugging the woman on her left. After the kisses, she and the other woman turn toward us, the audience, and wink with big fake smiles on (pretty hair do and bright red lipstick). She cries loudly about her mother's death and I suddenly realize it is two lesbian women who are kissing sexually and pretending to us they are lamenting the mom's death. I feel surprised. Other people are crying too. (420 words)

I am watching a singing group and while I'm in the audience, they march by. I sing loudly to show them I have talent. Of course they can't hear me, but I just keep hoping they'll notice. At one point I'm on the stage and they are marching by. Others in the audience are singing too. (56 words)

It's easy to learn my lessons now. I am in a writing class writing fast to keep up. Both my daughters and I are learning "freshman" writing together. We leave the class as it is over. It's crowded and I am in a wheelchair. I go up a crowded aisle, trying not to run over anyone seated on the edges. At the door I am standing. I walk out. It is dark and rainy. Ellie points to the next building and says, "there's the next class. Where's the path?" I walk ahead and see the path. "Here it is," I say. (101 words)

I am seated on a couch near a bike. I hear my father's yacht and think it would be fun to dance on the yacht, but choose not to. An old Indian woman in a wheelchair rolls up to me. She tells me that my father is using and wasting lots of gasoline that she and her people could use for a better life. I feel badly. She leaves. A good-looking man watches caringly. I talk with a young adult woman who just got married. She shows me dream symbols. I see a stone and an iron and a shirt. I say, "Hey, these are all work. There is no fun here in this room." I see a philodendron plant on a worn carpet. The good-looking man comes and stands by me. He is loading his gun. I say, "Oh, so that's where the bullets are" (a box on a dresser). My father uses those bullets too. He says, "Yes," and I tell him about my experiences with the old woman. We are very close. He says, "I'll show you how to load the gun." Our heads touch as we draw closer to look. I see big, grey pewter bullets. It feels very good to be close to this caring man. (211 words)

I took a good bath and then I lay down in a "University" bathtub which belongs to Dickie. I am wearing blue jeans and no top. It is unnecessary to take the second bath. I then go to put some makeup on. I put on lipstick. I choose a necklace with little hearts on it. I think about one that has little birds and hearts and choose not to wear it. I put on eye shadow. It is thick and globby. I scrape some of it off. (87 words)

I see a high rack filled with books, like in a book store. A man is seated near it, in front of it on one side. He looks a little forlorn. He says, "You've got your books and people. I just want a job." I go to one of my "aunts" and tell her about him. We all own a big ranch and we agree to give him a job as a cowboy, riding a horse. I ride the horse to the ranch, which is a little like V's house. I go toward the front enclosed porch. There is a busy restaurant there. A woman has ordered eggs and is unsatisfied with the ones she got, so I step in to cook her new eggs. I give her the eggs and then try to scrape the old ones with a bit taken out of them onto a platter to serve to someone else. I pick up rice and eggs from under the platter with my spoon. A man watches and I feel a little embarrassed like I'm cheating or being stingy. (181 words)

A crowd of people want to get the best seats and rush forward. I want to be one of them, but hesitate. They go up a lot of stairs and sit way up high in a balcony near the stairs. I realize I'm glad I didn't join them. The stairs would have been hard. I leisurely go up a few stairs until I get an adequate, only slightly blocked view. I start to sit on a "pew" but notice a purse. I choose the next lower "bench" as it is empty and I don't want to share the space with anyone. I have to bend my head some to be able to see clearly.

I am in my wheelchair and come up to the reception counter at the doctor's office. I say, "I'm here for my appointment." She says, "Yeah, 9 minutes after 10. You're late." She is putting some sickly looking grapes and berries into a bowl. They are a pale white and look a bit slimy. I look at another clock. It says one minute after 10. I say, "I'm only one minute late. That's not so bad." She calls out to someone else to verify the time. She grudgingly agrees I might be right. (93 words)

There's this old guy who owns a business (maybe a trailer court) and a young guy who is very business astute. They become politicians and are very good. The young guy has a sister who is sheltered at home. He goes to pick her up. We are sitting in the back seat of a car. The sister says to her older woman friend. "I put the long line (underpants) in my purse." The woman shushes her. I lean to the woman and say, "I hope you'll take good care of her. I know you will." A sort of secret here. I'm not supposed to know they are planning on sneaking off. But I have figured it out and I am giving my blessings. The woman then notices we are driving up a very steep hill and is surprised. "Where we are going?" she asks. I smile and say, "Wait 'til you see it's even steeper and more curved up ahead." We round a curve and I see an ocean side cottage up facing the cliff side. A sign indicates a sea shell and souvenir shop. I think that's an odd place to have it. Rarely is this road traveled because it is residential. We pull up to an older woman's house. We go inside.

I am visiting Carol and Rob and am in the bathroom brushing my teeth. Rob sneaks in, thinking he is finding Carol. I feel a little embarrassed, like I'd been caught with my pants down. There is no water, so I turn on a faucet. Slimy green gunk comes out of the faucet. I get some on my brush. A child tells me it will make me sick. I enjoy Carol and Rob's company. I think I should buy Sat. dinner, but I don't. (84 words)

Merle comes by to visit. His wheelchair is a miniature clown car. I come into the living room to see it and I laugh. Two people are with him. I ask myself how I will be health-wise in 5 years. I look up on the ceiling and I see myself floating back down in some bubbly water. My eyes and my mouth are wide open and I'm staring. I feel queasy and think maybe I'm swimming and I try to make the image look a little less frightening and "dead." I then ask if I'm going to be in a relationship. I look around the living room and don't see anyone. Later, I go upstairs to talk to Jerome. Dickie is in his office and I sit next to him and tell him off. I wait for W so I can tell him off too. I see a window and notice I am now where the "health" image had been floating and I try to see it from another perspective. All I see is the living room from a ceiling view. (181 words)

My parents had taken the keys to my car. I went to someone who had my keys and demanded them back. I pointed out that I owned the car and paid for the insurance. They reluctantly gave me the keys. I got into the car to drive, only I ended up in the trunk. I had to lean out to the left to see and had trouble driving straight. I struggled and finally ended up in the driver's seat. (79 words)

I get angry at her and tell her she's wrong and too harsh. I have my classmates as witnesses and she'll get in trouble. She cowers angrily. Then my classmates and I get to our dormitory room which has beautiful spacious pieces of antiques and ritzy furniture. It's a big open space and each girl's space is marked by her furniture.

A princess and I are trying to hide out. There is an old boyfriend around. We go to a house to get a room. I walk down two flights of stairs. The banister is very rickety and wobbly. The man at the top of the stairs is thrilled to be touching the same banister I am. We get to the bottom of the stairs and the princess says, "The landlady won't show us a room. We'll have to take it sight unseen." I go to the landlady and say, "I want to see the room before we decide to take it." Something in my tone makes her decide to show me the room. We walk down a hall to our "room," which is a bed and a tiny two-drawer bureau. There is a large window with a nice view and more space because it's at the end. I ask if there is a bureau and she says not. I ask if I am expected to buy one. We agree I do. (171 words)

I look out a window. My father is gathering up a group of young people. They gather up in a circle and start singing "Swing Low Sweet Chariot." I feel teary because it's my favorite song and I sing along even though I know it will hurt my throat and cause it to close up. I look at photographs of my Adam cousins. Millie comes into the house. She's all dolled up for a date and is waiting for him to arrive. It's near midnight. I am quite surprised because she's married. I sit next to her and put my hand on her arm. "Aren't you married?" I ask hesitantly. She looks upset and says, "Jim died." I say, "I'm sorry. I didn't know." I remember back. She's had five husbands, each one for just a few years; some died, some divorced. I go to the Dairy Queen. There is a turquoise Cadillac, 1955, there. I drive it around. There are two matching turquoise pistols on the hood. I have to take the car back. I try to turn left on a road full of bumper-to-bumper traffic. Finally I get to the D.Q. Others push the car as the engine isn't on. I pull in. The owner seems relieved as he didn't know what happened to the car. People are bringing books to a used book sale. A woman hands in a pile of books that are the best of the bunch. I see Science Fiction titles. (247 words)

I am around a table with C department people. Josh says we have to go to another place so Tyler is going to walk with me. As we are walking up the street, we look ahead and see a huge water buffalo loose. He is quite active so Tyler and I decide we'll climb up a tree to be safe. I climb up. There are lots of other people in the tree. The water buffalo decides to try and reach me. He rears up and stretches his nose and I scramble up higher and higher. I'm now clinging to some pretty skinny branches. He finally goes away. I climb down and Tyler and I continue walking, talking excitedly about our narrow escape. Then I notice Tyler isn't there. I look around and see I'm in a bad neighborhood, sleazy bars, etc. I think, "Where is Tyler when you need him?" I look behind me and see Tyler and Mabel talking and laughing. I feel jealous and hurt. I keep walking. Mabel catches up and I want to share the buffalo story, but I don't to "teach her" or punish him. Then I relent and tell her. Joe F. is ahead and has a skinny, flimsy motorbike. He asks me to help get it started. I tease him. So do some tough guys. Now I'm in a house. I want to go outside and go to an extension of the house and get a book, but it's dark outside and I turn on the porch light, but decide it's safer to go back in and go through the house to get to the extension to get my book.

I find purses with pockets and they look pretty, but they won't do. Then I notice that the merchandize section of Payless is very small.

I am looking at a rack of clothes and see a pretty blouse. I say, "I don't remember owning this." Then I realize it's my mother's blouse. She says, "You can have it." She looks slim and young and well dressed. Dee Dee is also there, so I put it on. It is black with little flowers on it (roses) and short-waisted. I look good. I say, "I have a tension headache," and Dee Dee places her hands on my head to massage it. It feels very good. She hurts her hand and hops around wiggling it in the air. I apologize. She says, "It's OK. I see Bob V. I say, "Hey Bob, what about the scanner?" He says, "What about it?" I say, "Can I borrow it? He says, "Sure. Let's talk about it over a drink, a tomato and a drink after work." I say, "OK." He leaves and I say to Dee Dee, "He's married." She says, "Well, last week he had an affair with Mirabelle." I decide to go to my office without my wheelchair, to walk it. I hope I have enough energy. I start down lst floor hall and remember my office is on the 4th floor. I feel strong and good and hope it lasts the whole day. I pass a flower shop and a friend says, "How do you like it after we remodeled?" I said, "It looks good," and put a flower in my hair. I pass a counter. A woman says, "You're a Jew." I say, "Think again," quite belligerent. She is mortified and embarrassed for her mistake. I lecture her and go to find the elevator. I finally find it. Two other women with their guitars are on the elevators. The doors are malfunctioning and no one else can get on. We are worried, but make it to the 4th floor. Now I am carrying one guitar case. The clasps are open and I'm trying to close them as I walk. (333 words)

I look to my left and see waves and realize that a tidal wave is coming in. I go to the house to get Howard so we can drive to safety. Then it's over and I see the muddy ground.

My "roommate" kicked me out and I had to leave without any money or my clothes. I came back and packed my things so I would be all right. I go out to a living room. Pete and Maggie are there. Nate comes in, all excited. He has a formula, an answer. But he can't figure out some of the symbols. He asks me what they mean. I look at them and say, "I don't know." I give up and start to walk to my room. He insists I try. It is a shaped thing and he says it means guilt but he doesn't know what the "B" means. I say, "I don't know." We all sit on the couch and as he's talking, I caress his back and hair. Maggie looks surprised and Nate says, "We used to be good friends," or, "We're old friends." I am aware of Pete. He feels jealous. I get up to regretfully walk away, a small two-yea- old child clings to my legs. It is pleasant, the closeness, and we walk away from Nate. (181 words)

I am in a large room, sort of a bedroom/classroom. My client Tim (student) comes in with 3 pals, all in a joking mood. They are cute. I go over to a round table to check my appointment times. A man walks through, smiling to himself. I leave and am walking down a hilly sidewalk. I hear 1950's upbeat music and see a sorority group dancing with long sorts of charm skirts. It is amazing. I start to dance too, laughing. I stop and sit on the prickly grass near the area to watch. A man who likes me (like the cute guy from Mechanics Dept.) asks me over to sit with him on the sidewalk stairs to his house. He asks his son permission. I come into the house. The man and his son like me. The son is going to perform a trick for me. He will look like he's hanging himself, but he is safe the whole time. The father and I are nervous about it. It appears that the rope around his neck is too tight. We grimace when he does. He does the trick, sort of, and it's OK. (194 words)

He has warm eyes and watches me. I continue shopping. I find a bin with things in it. I find a black graduation tassel. I look up and see the man watching me. I have a hard time making eye contact. I feel a little flustered and embarrassed. I see the baby on a couch propped up with pillows drinking a bottle. She starts to sit up and falls off the couch. I run to catch her. So does he. I pick her up, cooing to her. She's all damp from spilt milk and sweat and urine. I say, "Let's get you cleaned up, then you'll be more comfortable." I hug her. She has dark, curly hair. The man approves. (156 words)

I tell them to imagine someone really nice being next to them. They giggle, so I say, "OK, it's obvious you aren't ready for this so we'll just stop." I am disappointed in them. I want to take the day off from all the activities. I go to rest and see a woman in a yellow French cut swimsuit.

I am looking at images of what went wrong in our marriage. Lots of snapshots, interviews; I remember the color black. I am helping my bad ex-husband set up a shower. It's a lot of tall, ungainly pipes. Between us we get it set up and the cold water pours out of the shower head. I take a cold, cold shower. I am fully clothed and find a small sample bottle of shampoo in my shirt pocket. I wash my hair and arms. I feel very invigorated by the shower because it is so cold. I step out and walk jauntily past my ex-husband and all the pictures. A voice (maybe my brother, Jake) says, "Now, do me a favor. Give him the shampoo. You can work together a little bit." I realize I had selfishly kept the bottle, which had only cost 75 cents. I gave it to him. [BL] (150 words)

Even if someone was afraid of that tree, I'd still plant it. Then the person can learn not to be afraid. You can't not have trees because one person is afraid.

I find a bird feather-shaped earring hanging caught on a zipper loop of my jumper top. It is Lucy's and I say, "Oh look, here is your earring."

Lucy and I are talking. She is concerned. I notice that a baby is in a crib, but the walls of the crib are down and she could fall out. She looks uncomfortable. I feel compelled to help her. I hold her for a while. Then I put her in the crib and pull up the sides so she is well protected. She suddenly feels more relaxed and closes her eyes to sleep comfortable. I go to find some videos to show George and we all decide to order up a video movie to watch for fun. I ask everyone if they want to do that and they agree. I feel guilty about leaving the baby unattended for so long. She may wake and need me, but these people need me and besides I want to have fun. I uncomfortably put aside my nervousness about her.

Jerome is thinking of moving on to another job. It's time. He's done all he can here. I am a little annoyed at him. He's so arrogant.

His wife - maybe he's hiding from her. Anyway, I scrape off the frosting and cake to uncover him. Later, I say, "These gifts are all for him." I take them to his office and say in a belligerent tone, "Here is a gift from someone who didn't like you, but who has changed his mind." Jerome laughs. I say, "You were a son of a bitch, you know." He agrees. There are two very long, flat and tall gifts up on his desk leaning against the wall. I give him several other gifts as well. (154 words)

Merle and I are wheeling up a hilly road. We're going to go swimming. We go into a glass building and see a pool. I tell Merle I don't have a suit or a cap. He looks a little annoyed and says, "How did you expect us to swim?" I shrugged my shoulders. He says, "Maybe there is a suit in the locker room." Three drunk men walk into the pool fully clothed. The owner comes and chases them out. He fires them. I realize that a good job is now vacant, an executive position. I decide to apply. I go into the secretary (Judy) and put in my application. The guy recognizes me and says "Now here's the best expert!" I feel pleasure. It's a vocational rehab job near the University and I'm good at DIS awareness. I whisper to Judy to be sure to tell me as soon as she knows, no special favors, but we are friends. She kind of snickers. Then I go to a room to wait. It's like a spare bedroom in Ginny and Ernie's house. Ernie's old desk, with his name on it. Ellie and the baby are there. I hold Charla. I yell, "Shut up," once and feel guilty. I change her. We decide to go downstairs and have to sit on the desk, which is an elevator. I hold Charla. (229 words)

I am in a movie. I play one part in the morning and go to another set to play another part in the afternoon. I dress up real sexy. Three guys follow me into the elevator. I avoid eye contact to let them know I'm not interested. One guy opts to get out because I'm so cold. That's the same floor I'm getting off on, the 3rd floor. I flash my wrist to tell them I'm OK and supposed to be there. A woman says, "Go get your name band. Tell her (the secretary) your name (character name) is Pandemonium." She makes a wrist band for me. I think this is all a lot of fun, playing different parts and lots of people around me. (125 words)

Lucy is driving my car. I am giving her directions, like backup. "Go straight. Stop now! You've only got another foot to a slight drop off." I couldn't imagine why I just didn't do the driving. It would be easier and safer. Jake is in the pickup as well. We are in a parking lot. We park and get out. Jake is being very apologetic and I say, "Don't over help." They go ahead and I try to catch up. I call out, "Sandy." I'm in an intersection. A crowd is gathering. There is some ceremony where money is being given to a disability cause. I see Lucy and Jake and then I am crowded in by many, many tall men. I look around and exclaim, "So tall! It's not fair!" They can see well. I'm all smashed up against some guy's beige polyester suit. Cameras are everywhere. They can't see me I'm so crowded in. Some man says,"Where do we donate?" And a man says, "It's already been done." The money's here already and I notice I'm standing right at the center of the attention where a round baseball is. The crowd has suddenly thinned out. The cameras are gone. The excitement is over.

Dovre comes to me upset. I suggest to her that she create a ritual, a ceremony, and then she'll feel better. I suggest that she go outside to the big bathtub and I'll lay her down in the water. I tell her to think of the words she wants said over her. I feel a little tired, but agree to do the ceremony with her or for her. I also tell her to think of what to say to other people ahead of time. I give her examples for my mother and for Jake. I say, "So if Jake says, 'Yeah! That's stupid,' you can say, 'I can see you don't agree with my decision, but I think it's important.'" Something about religion. Something about a baby. I pick up an unfinished crocheted rug, round, in pastel baby colors, and start to crochet. I tell Dwight that if he wants me to make one for his baby, it would cost a lot. It feels good to be doing my crafts again. (171 words)

I go into a town on the coast. I've shopped there before, but I'd never stayed so long or go so deeply into the town. I am enjoying the book shop or library. Then I'm in a hotel room. The room next door has a piano and I hear classical music. It's time for the kids and me to take a nap. They squiggle around and are not cooperative. My huge xerox machine is not working right. Copies come out on ripped paper or are buried under old papers. A woman helps me. I finally get a clear copy. I see my cousin Sonja; I ask her if she's all right. She grimaces, she's "OK." I have a huge fat, short, pink cigarette and I want to smoke, it but I can barely fit it in my mouth. I borrow a wooden match from Sonja. I light it and puff frantically. She helps me by putting lots of matches in the cigarette end to try to catch them all on fire. (171 words)

I am peeking into "Brenda's" purse and find a long, rectangular metal box that is full of junk. It's my box. I put things back and realize that I haven't remembered the exact placement, so she'll know I've been invading her privacy. I feel embarrassed but, oh, well, some woman sees me and asks what I'm doing. I ignore her. Brenda's husband drives home and parks the red convertible on a rounded, semi-dome driveway. I think the dome on the mansion is better, more authentic. Brenda puts things up on the wall. She's still angry at me, and then she needs my help. She wants me to watch dinner for her and I agree, hoping this will make up for the peeking. I look in the skillet and see the meat frying. "Dog Meat," I say, disgusted. The other woman plops in a big candied ham. I feel a little better. (151 words)

I am handed a program by my sister Lydia. First she brings me a bowl of ice cream and an apple pie slice. I ask if there is sugar in it. She says yes. I say, "I guess I have to find out sometime if its OK to eat." I eat it and am o.k. I am looking at the instructions in the book she gave me. A man is watching, behind me. I start to cry, deep hurtful sobs and he says, "You there, the one crying, shut up." As he says, "Shut up," I yell at him, "Shut up." I keep crying. I write down who has helped me to find myself. I write Peter and then add me and Peter, me and ____, me and ____. I also write in Bonnie and Ginny. I see a miniature man's hat. I'm supposed to put it on. One the next page is a note to me if I decide not to go on. It's a pep talk of some kind. (171 words)

I am visiting a historical home of Edgar Allen Poe. I walk down several flights of carpeted stairs that are steep, with no handrails. I have to be careful and I trip and slip a few times. I go into his bedroom. There is a man laying on his bed, which is a water bed. The shirt (blue flowers on a white background) is over the body of the man, head and all. He gets up and leaves. I go out into the hall and say, "Which wa?." "You choose," is the answer. There is a narrow stairway going down. I pass it and go across the hall to the Press Room. He has a letter press. I touch the metal letters and symbols in awe. I see "mats" of advertising and see sports emblems, noticing one for the Grizzlers (M City High). I am pleased. I think they must be bored here because they always see the same samples. I turn and go back down the hall. I turn left into his parents' bedroom. The dresser looks ordinary, but the bed is strange. There's an open hole in the middle with metal pieces, like a dining room table that opens to put in extra leaves. I think, "That must be where they keep the extra blankets and covers." (219 words)

A young woman didn't get her money back right away and she's crying and won't listen to reason. Bonnie and I send her on her way, laughing at her gently. I find a sticker to put on the spine of a book and have some difficulty getting it to stay stuck. Bonnie has found some food she really loves. It is like a spread to put on crackers. Two ingredients are put together. She says, "It is so delicious." She just can't wait to taste it again. She is quite excited. "Try it," she says. I see a platter with graham crackers and saltine spread with a thin layer of stuff. I choose the saltine, cause it doesn't have sugar. "Hum," I say, "It does taste good." I'm not as thrilled as Bonnie. Now I'm going into a house to take the baby to visit Grandma. A nice man is there. He dives into a pool of water to adjust the pipes. He is very helpful. It's time to leave. He'd like me to stay and visit. I take the baby to Grandma to say goodbye for awhile. (188 words)

His wife greets me and we hug and talk. Then we are sitting next to a car. Russ and I are seated so close I'm practically in his lap. I become aware that that is too intimate, so I get in the car (VW). I say, "Who is going to drive, you or me?" He doesn't care, so I decide to drive and get in the driver's seat.

A group of older women had just left and are together gossiping. I don't feel like I belong with them. I walk on, alone. I'm trying to get to my house (old M City House), and walk up a dirt path. I see a man leading a cow, which then meows. I tease him about, "What kind of animal is it really?" It then looks like a goat. I turn left and walk across a field to my house. (150 words)

I am holding a baby and we are at the ocean. The waves go way far back and roll up to where we are. I hold the baby and she leans back, submersing her face under water, and holding her breath. I am very proud of her and say, "Look Dwight, how she holds her breath and doesn't choke on the water." We get up out of the water. Dwight has gone on ahead. An inspector comes up and wants information about Dwight. We go to the pickup and he looks around. I say, "You won't find anything." He gets in the driver's seat and as he is driving, I calmly tell him, "We don't have any brakes, you know." He pumps the brakes and sure enough there aren't any.

I have to go to the bathroom. I find a stall and sit down on the toilet. I hear lots of water sloshing and smell urine. I realize that I have sat down on a toilet that was full to the brim and dragged my skirts in the urine and water. I attempt to get the skirt out of the water. I try to urinate. It feels like I have a bladder infection. Small quantities come out and it's hard to push. I look over the short stall door and chat with a woman in the next stall. I get up to return to where I was, either counseling or a class, very aware of how I smell of urine. I feel embarrassed but know there isn't much I can do about it. Some guy wants me to counsel him. I am not interested in helping. I notice I have square boxes on my feet. I must have accidentally stepped in them and can't get them off. I see Dylan and ask him to help me. He does, smiling at my predicament in a friendly, teasing way. I slide down the hall, unable to stop easily. (196 words)

I invite her to visit my house, explaining that she can watch soap operas on TV (we could hear them from the house). She agrees reluctantly and follows me into the house. I am wearing a wedding ring, two of them. One is a store demo that has two words written on it. Bonnie is in the house. (129 words)

I am in the M City House and looking out the pool room window at the little house. I notice it is very ornate, Victorian-like, and am surprised I don't remember it like that. I see two officials and two girl singers at the platform. The conference has begun. I go through a door to see the exhibit table. Things are all piled up. I start to spread things out so they can be seen. I try to make an attractive display. PR (marketing) is important. I notice flyers for my book and also discuss the need for a sign on the door since the door is kept shut and the speakers and singers of my organization are in there. Ellie tells me a story about Judy who is nearby listening. She (Ellie) says Judy had lots of affairs. Once she even put the picture of one of the guys on her dresser and she was still married to her husband. Judy wasn't very proud of that. She sits right in front of me as I am trying to watch the TV. I sit up and put my head resting on hers or over to the right side. We are very close. George gives me a necklace. I decide to use the beads to sell for the organization. I take the beads off the string. As I do so, Judy and I discuss how much to sell it for. She suggests $100/a pound. I say there's not very many pounds. "There's five pounds," she says. I say, "You should sell them by the beads. You'd make more." Then I see George nearby and feel embarrassed and hope he doesn't notice that I took his personal gift and broke it up to use for the organization. Judy points him out to me. I wonder if I'd done wrong, again, made an incorrect decision. When I was removing the beads and exclaimed, "There is even capro holders on this string." That was some kind of rare thing, a treasure.

I go past and show Ellie my long chain of linked key chains. She shows me hers of equal length. Arvonne shows hers. I am surprised she enters into the discussion. We all sit at a long table. Arvonne says, "It's a good thing we've taken the afternoon because it will take lots of time for her to share all about her new boyfriend." I think, "Humm. Another one so soon. She's fast." I take a sip of oxygen off a tube out of the wall because we are on another planet and we need oxygen. Merle comes and joins us. I notice he is thinner and better-looking. I ask him how he does something. He growls, "That's personal. I won't tell you." "Well," I say, "You sure are in a grumpy mood. What's so personal about that? I'd ask anyone that question." I am aware that Arvonne had been ready to share and we were using the time focused on someone else. I felt badly. (197 words)

My sister Lydia and I are moving into my brother's old room, the big blue room. It's a mess. Lydia and I had been sleeping on stage, our heads of the beds nearest the audience, so we saw the back of the stage. We slept in twin beds side by side. Now I am sweeping the boys' room which is an extension of the stage area. There are two big windows, lots of dirt and grime on the wall under the windows. I sweep and sweep and notice some burnt logs from a fire. I put the logs in a fireplace "closet." The place hasn't ever looked this clean. I decide it would be nice to remodel the fireplace into a closet to put clothes. I can't decide whether to keep the beds where they are or to put them in the alcove with the windows. I decide to put them in the alcove, even as I decide to feel some regret over not being on stage. Then I decide that area can be our play area. We can divide it in half: half hers, half mine. I go out into the audience area. I ask someone if it will be too expensive making the fireplace into a closet. They say no. I guess it's OK. Someone says, "You really looked scared when the play started, but it was good, it worked with the lines." I said, "I really was scared!" They said, "I'll never forget how you said the first line, something like, "After all --- ain't it like the boys." (262 words)

I am going to go to town. I notice we are approaching wet ground and I am somewhat concerned we don't slide into the ocean. We turn parallel to the shallow water and start to go through an archway. I then see the real ocean and a huge brown wave surging through the door. We back up hurriedly so as not to be drowned. Later, we go through the doorway, looking carefully for more waves. (75 words)

I am in a wheelchair. Someone says, "Let's go downstairs and make fresh bread." I pull my chair around me like a deflated flotation device. I call Michael over. He's driving a two-seater with a small truck bed behind it, quite fancy. I ask him if he were to get a set of tools, which ones would he get? I don't want him to know I'm thinking of getting him some tools as a gift. A man calls us over. He's upset we're all in chairs, or maybe I'm thinking he might be upset. He says, "Well, for instance, what if I was black instead of white?" Lucy says it wouldn't make any difference to her. She's blind. [BL] (118 words)

My male attendant and I are standing next to an old junky car. He tells me to wait, stand there and wait while he arranges the broken front seat. He isn't very effective and it takes a long time, I am annoyed. I go use the women's bathroom and come back. He says "Oh, I thought it was broken." I said, "No, that wasn't the men's room. The plumbing is broken there. I used the women's room and it worked fine." (81 words)

The Drapes Nightmare. Ellie kept bothering me. She came into my house and wasn't thinking, just kept being in the way or annoying me. I tried to get her to leave me alone. I wanted to go to bed. I got into a small, thin brass bed but the covers and pillows wouldn't stay put. It was uncomfortable. I was very angry. I pushed and shoved to throw her out and she'd keep popping back in. I looked out the window and Arvonne was dressing up to go out. She was putting on a blond wig. It was a brassy, bright bee hive blonde hairdo. I was glad she was getting out of my way too. Now I'm in my room and sort of on a boat in a closed up space. A horrible dog/boy creature is attacking me and it bites savagely. A man behind me says, "I'll help. Let me do that." I say nothing but continue to take the attack. It is very painful; constant and scary. Ellie is also attacking. I throw it away and it lunges back at me. I scream in agony and frustration. The man can't take it anymore. He grabs the horrible attacking thing and throws it into a garbage disposal. I scream, "No!" and hear the grinding up of its body and can't bear the thought of its pain or death. I don't want to cause anyone else pain. Then I look again in renewed horror because the thing is now four times larger, an ugly large boy, and he's crawling out of the garbage disposal to get me even worse. I run to escape. I go into a room, like a living room or a captain's bedroom of a boat. I go to the tall windows and try to climb up, pulling myself hand over hand up the drapes. Each drape I try to climb up falls and is replaced by another drape. This happens over and over and over. I know now I'm trapped. I panic, sobbing. I pick up objects off the dresser to heave it at the window to break it open and it just bounces off like it was Mylar plastic windows. Nothing I do helps. I am condemned to this hell for eternity.

The Hitler Dream. My boyfriend and I are going up hill. I am on a train or in a wheelchair. My boyfriend sees Hitler and feels he must introduce me to Hitler. I want to be with my boyfriend, but as soon as Hitler sees me, he decides he wants to have sex with me. I have no choice. I feel trapped, resigned, scared. But before he can hurt me, I must be seen by either a priest or a counselor, I'm not sure which. It saves me. It intervenes and he (Hitler) goes away. The priest or counselor stands behind me and sort of hovers over me. (108 words)

The Arkansas Dream. Jolene and I are somewhere. A man comes by. I tell him Jolene is going to Arkansas and I tell her he's from my Arkansas hometown. He's either an old friend or a cousin. I am also aware I've rarely or never been to Arkansas. Before she goes, we decide to go down some stairs (even though I'm in a wheelchair. It's a bumpy ride.) We get to an open place. Jim, the community college priest, is fat and smiley. He comes over and tells me he's going to buy some illicit drugs. He puts on a see through plastic bag and goes to a sale table. I am quite surprised at this. I also see a woman wearing an old-fashioned, long skirted ruffly dress in Scotts plaid. Her plastic bag has the same plaid. I can't see who she is. I say, "I think I've seen that nightgown before." I then decide to go shopping. I see rows and rows of colorful yarn - pinks, blues, whites and a beautiful Irish knit bedspread. I touch it and notice it is polyester 4 ply, lightweight and slick. But the pattern is pretty. I see several others and think I'd like to have one. (206 words)

The Pushed Aside Dream. I created an idea for a skit and then I see some famous actress doing my part, Jill St. James. I think she and two actors put jock straps on over their pants. It's a statement about women being oppressed. Now I'm with a group of women and we're doing the skit. I comment to some woman that I had the idea first, really. I feel a little embarrassed, like I'm being immodest or pushy. I look at the script because I can't remember exactly how it goes. We go to a men's auto shop class and begin. I play the part of a welfare mom. The man says there's no space available for me and I eloquently say, "If I were a man, there would be. I'm a welfare mom, etc. etc." It was well received. Now the group bows and I prepare to bow, the group keeps getting larger until I'm off in a corner by the wall and no one can see me at the end of the line. The applause is warm. As we prepare to leave, a man who is a manager is interested in my SKILLS. (196 words)

The boss smiles and says with pride, "I have a very long one, of course." I enter and he says, "I might ask you to recon the cost of the dinner." I say, "Oh, I can already.

Some woman is annoyed with me because she gave me some information and I didn't get it back to her. I agree to get it for her. I get the papers and remember I was going to xerox it first -- it's a lot of information on music. I take it to a xerox machine. An office worker wants to know if I've been watching Hank because he has refused to make a copy of what he was supposed to copy. I say, "No, I haven't." Hank walks in and I say, "Hi Hank," to alert the other woman not to talk about him. I try to xerox. It is hard. There is a lot to copy. I ask Jock to help me. He does. Then I have to go to my dorm room to get more knitted clothes that belong to the woman. We pass a busy military-like man who has helicopter-like machine displays. Get to my room and Jock/Abner gets the clothes, sometimes getting my own clothes almost mixed up with the others. I look up at the ceiling and say, "What happened to my ceiling?" It has ribbon bows on it and the asbestos is on it. It's a mess. Someone explains, but I don't remember the reason. [BL] (211 words)

Someone brings in gifts for Libby and me, small corsages of flowers. I reach for one. It has a folded hankie on it (like the one Aunt Esther gave me when she died).

I am at Thea's house and can't get what I want. Someone tells me that Howard has died. I think, "Oh, so young. Only 44 years old." I feel sad and know it will be sadder over the next few days. I go to get my car, which is broken. There are two, a van and a spiffy car. I think, "I can't use the car because my chair won't fit in." The mechanic is busy and tells me he can't fix it yet and gives me a reason. I tell him I need it because Howard died and that is a stronger reason. He doesn't care. I then remember there will be an inheritanc, but I will have to fight for it. I think, "I'll use the inheritance to get a degree in psychology, another two years of school." I sit in a chair like the swim lift chair and want it to go forward, but someone set the brakes and it tries to go forward like a train (chug chug chug chug) and folds over itself and is broken.

An Indian man who looks like Hector loves to fly. I tease him and say derogatory things about flying. I am with a group of white people. He says, "Have you flown? You should try it before you put it down." I shrug and agree to try it. I get on the plane, which is like a motorcycle. He is behind me with his arms around me to reach the controls. I wonder if it is too hard for him to control the plane from that awkward position. He shows me how to move levers and buttons. (To get to the plane, we had to go through a secret panel, down a ladder into a secret huge room.) I was being stared at by the other Indians because I was the enemy and I might tell where this place is. I look out to sea where we can take off. I see meadow and trees and think, "Not enough room here." I am aware of a wall that looks like a mural of a forest. I am aware that it is a false wall hiding the runway, and yet I am not aware of it. Before we can fly, we gather around to sing. He begins to sing. It is pretty, but ordinary. I say to him, "Sing it like you mean it. Sing it to someone." He looks to me with loving eyes, and sings with warmth, depth and beauty. I look at him and enjoy. After the song he gets up and walks to me and we hug. I feel the fat of his plump face and the scraggly whiskers. He says to me, "I love you." I hesitate. I say, "I know." I want to return the words, but feel constrained. I don't say it. I think, "Maybe I'll grow into loving him slowly." Now I am a member of their side. But before we can fly a mission, I must go back up with the group and appear normal with them. Then I will sneak off to the plane. So I go there and chit chat and he gathers up my stuff. He puts them near the secret door. I go and bow and go to the secret door. I know she suspects and is looking for me. I must hurry. The secret door is the wooden slate table my father made when I was 13. There is a curtain behind it and then the ladder down. The stuff is backed up, too much stuff: Coke, paper cups, sweater, books, etc. I may get caught if it doesn't go down the ladder faster. I poke and try to hide it all. At the last second it goes down and so do I. (456 words)

I am at my son's house (he's black). I play a violin. At first I just play random notes. I realize I am remembering how to play songs and my son is impressed with my skill. Then I go to visit a friend. I am an old black man. My friend and I stand in front of his place, an old hotel. He says, "Why did you call me out here?" I said, "Because I wanted to tell you what happened without anyone else around because I can't tell you without clenching my fists." Then I go to a pile of my belongings and choose two small "windshield" paintings I'd done to give to his wife as a gift. I notice that I'm a good artist. I'd drawn a picture of some woodland creatures. We go upstairs. I knock open the door. Lots of some family is in there. I introduce my spouse and two sons and apologize for being so many. The wife welcomes us. I see her sewing; she has three sewing machines. Ginny points out some dresses and blouses she made hanging in an open closet. Her stepson picks up something for her. I say, "I must go catch the bus," but first I see a group of people dancing. I stand limping on the sidelines watching. Ginny looks at me compassionately. Skip and Cheryl are dancing. He looks at me, staring at my limp. I glare at him until he drops his eyes. Then I see the bus; it's full. Then I remember I should dye my newsletter green. I try to do it quickly, it only spots some places. I get frustrated. (It isn't going to look good, as usual.) I go catch the bus, putting two important small packages in my pink bag. (299 words)

I am busy organizing things when a cat falls into a river and gets its baby bunting suit wet. I get it out of the water and am preparing to change its clothes. I call out to this guy to fix lunch and tell him what I meant. I turn to shut the door and two small calico kitties are trying to sneak in. I push them back through with my foot and try to slide the door shut. They keep finding ways to poke their heads in. Finally I shut them out and turn to see that the man made a more complicated lunch than I had requested. I am annoyed that he didn't do it like I said and tell him so. (124 words)

I was swimming in a lake and noticed the water level was going down fast. The lake drained out entirely and I saw creepy white crustacean and fish crawling around on the new exposed surface. I thought, "Ugh. I was swimming around with those ugly things?" Some were that white that denotes never sees the light of day, like maggots. (60 words)

Then I'm on a couch and I have a little sickly duck that I sit next to the black night watch cat. There are 3 of them, black fuzzy Persians that have sharp, prominent teeth. They eat the duckling and I feel sick that I let that happen. Then I hear voices and slide down on the couch so no one can see me. I see three politicians like Haldeman, dishonest types sneaking out of a house and I listen in to their plans, hoping they don't see me. (89 words)

They won't let me sing my song. I'm a new member of a rock group, playing a guitar. The other members bring in new songs they've written and we do them. Then I shyly say, "I've written a song." The woman member sneers at me and says, "No. Not now." I say, "It's a good song. It has dynamics and really rocks." I was thinking she'd think it was badly written and wimpy. She isn't convinced. Another woman, as I had given up, says to me, "Let me try to convince her." The man singer kind of teases me. I say, "Hey, yours wasn't all that hot. I heard off-key notes and sometimes you were off beat. You were so noisy, you didn't hear yourself." He didn't believe me. (129 words)

I go to find Lucy. I knock at her door. One of her children calls, "Come in." I see that most of the furniture is moved out. I ask if Lucy is here. "She's in the kitchen." So I walk to the kitchen and look out the back window and see her grooming her horse. I remember she loved that horse and must be feeling sad to leave it. A phone rings and she tells one of the kids to be sure and answer it. I realize that I will be able to talk to her if she comes in to get the phone. I walk toward the phone in the living room. Lucy comes in,; she is naked. She gets up on the wooden rickety table (the only furniture left) and undoes the lamp fixture in the ceiling. There are lots of cobwebs. She tells the girls to be careful of the strings. I say, "I know you're busy, but could you tell me, in a nutshell, what made you do this? Just a few months ago, you were not going to have him and now you're gone." [BL] (189 words)

I am being introduced as a performer and the guy is teasing me. He says, "I know what I'll do. I'll announce your age. I know you are 55 years old." I laugh and tease back, "Then I'll just not respond, so there. If you say, 'So, you are 55 years old', I'll just say, "Yeah." I walk away from him laughing. I then ask who's going to sing the song. The doctor says the name or names. I say, "Oh, I thought maybe I would. Oh, well." Then I go out to find a bathroom. (96 words)

I am on a journey with a group of people. We are walking sort of single file on a woody, narrow trail. I look at one of the people who is standing transfixed, unmoving, at the intense beauty of the mountains, the waters, all that we can see. I am also intensely caught by the beauty of this place. Then we see antelope and polar bear together and sense some danger. They will kill each other for food (at least the bear will.) Our group starts moving back down the trail toward better possible safety. As we are retreating, I hear four beeps go off, the real danger alarm. What timing! I go to find my place to be of help, wondering what the emergency can be. A nun calls my name. I go to her and she tells me of this disabled boy who needs help. I am to help him. (152 words)

I have a newsletter for beginning writers. I also tell him I live in N City (on the opposite coast from him) and it is incredibly beautiful there. [BL] (70 words)

Someone chases my boyfriend. A young woman gives me the name of a man she thinks would be good for me to have as a boyfriend. I try to guess and say, "Is it Randy?" She laughs and says, "Oh! He's too young for you. I hope you are not insulted when you see who I've chosen." I feel a little curious and hurt. (64 words)

I am telling a classroom full of people that the fire alarm is ringing and they must vacate the room. They sit and look at me, a few leave, but a bunch in the back just sit there. I keep repeating my message, getting stronger voiced and more sarcastic by the moment. We are locked in a power struggle. I realize this and know that I'm creating it, so I back off after I struggle with the feeling that that is bad for me to lose face. I reflect a casual comment to one person. He gets up to leave and the rest follow. Outside I say to Bonnie, "I almost blew it there! I created a power struggle." (119 words)
Barb Sanders:#1070 (10/03/88)

I am escorted to a table at a restaurant by a charming Frenchman. I sit on the table on a cushion. It is a bit uncomfortable. He offers to fluff the pillows. I say, "Can I fix it so I can just lean back?" He said, "No, sorry that won't work." He holds a food tray and eloquently, with dramatic flair, pours me a drink which is a mixture of white and red wine. I taste it and pronounce it delicious. I hear Maurice Chevalier singing and am pleased that such a famous singer I had the privilege to hear. He and the Frenchman are sort of the same. The Frenchman kisses me. It is pleasant. He asks me if I want to take a bath (hot tub?) and I agree, realizing that what he really means is we will make love now. We walk into a crowded part of the restaurant. The waiter has a roasted rabbit and the Frenchman (owner of restaurant) says loudly so everyone can hear him, "I see no one wants our fine rabbit dish. I am not afraid. It is delicious. Serve me some." The waiter carves off a roasted leg (looks like chicken leg). (201 words)

A woman has hurt her foot. I must find a bucket so she can soak her foot. I go looking. I see Shane (hearing-impaired boy). Another woman asks him to help find the bucket. She doesn't realize he can't hear and gets annoyed. I take over and mouth the words carefully and repeat them. "I need to find a bucket. This is an emergency." I see a room where it had been before but it is now a restaurant. We finally find one and I take it to the hurt woman whose two feet are crippled, small and bent. I set up the bucket and she doesn't want to use it because it's painful. I encourage her to stay soaking for at least 15 minutes. It will be beneficial. (129 words)

I am in a house. Each room is small and compact, so I don't have to expend energy moving around. When I sit on my bed, I lean over to the dresser to get my clothes. There are shelves above the dresser. The bathroom is a small room off the bedroom. Then there are a series of small rooms in a row - a laundry room, a garden. Then a woman comes in. I am setting up a VCR to look over our work. A man, two men come in, one is my "husband." They want us to move so they can use the VCR. I get very angry because we were here first. I refuse to leave. The other woman cajoles me to leave. She says it's no big deal to us and would mean so much to them. I disagree and argue all the way out. I point out that the man is being manipulative; he has a room of his own and a working VCR. The man wants his credit cards back and I think about hiding them and keeping them. (184 words)
Barb Sanders:#1073 (10/07/88)

I am very upset with my "husband." He's in a room with "the guys" and ignoring me. I go into the room to give him some 6-packs of beer which he doesn't need as he has plenty on the counter. He doesn't even acknowledge me and I have to lie on the counter and force myself through a mail slot in the door to get out! Very uncomfortable. Then I see a newborn baby and I pick it up, walk down a long flight of stairs into a pool of water (swimming pool) and bathe the baby, total immersion. The baby is good at holding its breath. Then I'm hopping across a blue, yucky slough. I say, "Here's the slough," and I hop over it. I look, thinking it would not be pleasant if I slipped and fell in. After I cross both channels of the slough, someone and I lie on a raft/boat and go upstream in a wide and busy water channel. Someone asks if I hated crossing the slough and I say, "Yes, but when I was younger it was fine." I liked the slough then because it was alive and not polluted and it moved slowly. I looked behind me to see speeding boats approaching. I then say, "I've left my husband." The man says hopefully, "You've left him!" He wants me to connect with him. (230 words)

I am looking for my purse. So is Merle. I find it. I'm going upstairs to have lunch. I am run over and lay on the ground. A doctor comes over and says, "Don't move," and sticks pins in me. I realize I don't feel them. I say, "Oh no! Don't tell me it's my spine." He says, "Maybe not. Sometimes things are numb for a while." The man that ran over me comes to the emergency room as I'm being wheeled in on a stretcher. He says, "I was drunk." I am furious and scream at him that he ought to be hung up by his balls upside down for 100 years. That would teach him a lesson. I am livid. His father says, "We'll talk about this when you calm down." I then have to walk slowly up some difficult stairs to the emergency room. They see me and come running to help me up the last stair. A black woman is there and the nurse jokes about her color being a permanent tan. The black woman says someday people won't be afraid and will treat me normally. [BL] (190 words)

Jack Nicholson and I are attracted to each other. He and I hold hands and another woman sees it and goes, "Ah ha! Look here!" He says, "I hunger after her. We have to be touching all the time. I can't be away from her." Then the woman explains several volunteer jobs at the fair I could do. I choose to do the woman of color one where I give pieces of pie and make up hints to women. As we leave to go to my table, we notice the guy is laying down for a nap and not following me. I wonder if it's OK to leave Ellie, but decide she'll be OK. I say, "We'll leave without him, he'll catch up." I pretend I don't care. I go to the table and replace a dark-skinned Egyptian woman. I hear some man say, "Here's our Indian." They want me to change money, but won't let me put up a sign letting people know this will cost money. I object. They insist. I don't want them to feel cheated, thinking it was for free and then getting charged. (188 words)

I live in a rural town, sort of old west. Townsmen come to destroy my family. I escape out the back door and crawl under the porch, hoping they'll think I ran fast and chase after me off into the woods. I am worried that I made the wrong decision. A man searches around the porch area. I wasn't so smart, but I am covered up and he doesn't find me. After they leave, I decide I will masquerade as a boy to be safe, then no one will rape me or hurt me. I move to another town and get a job at a newspaper as an apprentice. I hero-worship the editor, who at first is like Clark Gable and then is an older man. I cook for him also. I grow up and am walking home to my remote cabin when a teen girl from school comes up to me and says there's something girlish about me. I think about becoming a girl again. The editor offers me a job, but it's in the town where I had left. I am afraid but go there. (187 words)

I am getting info at a sort of book store about a birds meeting which was canceled but I didn't know it. I was surprised I was the last to know. Merle is there and I get on his lap and he drives around. We are dancing to a beautiful waltz. I am graceful. It is warm and touchy. Then I see my father. I get in his lap and he hugs and kisses me and strokes my hair. I feel a little uncomfortable at first, but relax and enjoy the love. (92 words)

Money questions, how silly. I work for the Forest Service and am in a bed on a high platform. As I try to get up, I realize that there is a huge drop off if I take that first step and I could fall down for miles into the trees. I try to place my foot carefully, but then notice if I get out on the other side of the bed, the platform floor is there and it is safe. So I hop over to the safe side and get out. The new recruits are here and are asking a lot of questions about money. I laugh at their myopic concern about money when it isn't even the issue and someone says or I think "You did that too when you first started." Then I go get some clothes that are in a pile. I take off my nylons and a garter belt and start to put on a dress. I exclaim, "Yes! I am a woman," like I'd somehow forgotten that. I put on some ugly, conservative pants (polyester) and rethink if I want to wear that. (188 words)

I'm going up to the S Beach Hotel without a reservation, hoping a room is open for me. The cat (Pablito) is in the car. I'm in the passenger side. I go in and open a door. Someone, a bald man, is already in there. I apologize and try another room. An elderly couple is in there. I realize I'll probably be put in the dorm room as the conference starts Sat. night. So I at least will have a room but I am disappointed. [BL] (85 words)

My mother and I are talking on the phone. Mid-sentence she stops talking. I am concerned because I keep calling to her, "Mom, Mom, Mom." She doesn't respond. I wonder if she's ill or in trouble. I think of hanging up and calling back, but am afraid to let go of the connection. I watch the clock. It's 5 of 10 and I think I'll wait for 5 minutes and then call the police or Lydia to go check on her. Arvonne comes in and talks. (86 words)

Paulina is upset. I want to hold her. She resists and I say, "I want to hold you because I need it." She says impatiently, "OK, but let me turn around," and so turns her back on me to be able to cuddle spoon-like. I put my arms around her, being careful not to touch her breasts. I accidentally brush them. I hug her and rock her to soothe her. I like our position because I'm not face to face with her emotion. I see her/my face reflected in a window. (91 words)

I am taking the wet clothes off a baby. She is lying on a bed and is a mess. I look for a clean shirt and find several. I choose one that's lacy and pretty, but hard to get on her. We struggle getting her hand in the arm and finally succeed. Then I take off her messy diaper and clean her up. She shits when I don't have a diaper on her. I clean that up, shuddering. Now my mother says, "Give the baby to me and you count all this money on my bed." I see piles and piles of coins (change). Most of them are foreign currency. What a tiring task. I say, "I'd rather hold the baby. I haven't had a chance to." She says, "Later, you can do it later." I sigh and start working on the money. Then I'm helping a woman pack. There are lots of snap shots laid out on the bed, some of Willie, some of her lover. I am concerned that her husband will come in and find out! I try to gather them up. Then I must hurry and I choose the shoes to pack, discarding several "Baby Jane" shoes for little girls. [BL] (204 words)
Barb Sanders:#1085 (10/30/88)

I am with a woman and we go up a flight of stairs. It is hard. I wonder why I keep trying to do it. We are in a hotel where there are no walls between rooms. The placement of the furniture tells you where a room is. There is communal dining, and a back stairs for the more privileged, richer guests. I see Chuck. He ignores me, won't look at me or talk to me. He's angry. I say to him, "Isn't it OK that I want to quit work?" He says, "No!" He doesn't approve. He has Carona disease and he didn't stop work. I say, "Isn't arthritis worse than that?" He says no. I feel upset. (119 words)

I'm in a group of people, and I am explaining to them how disabled people don't like it when people rush up to open the door for them. I see lots of the people raise their hands to add comments and I say, "Yeah, I know what you're going to say. You are just being courteous and would do it for anyone, not just the disabled. But I'm talking about beyond normal enthusiasm." I decide I need to go to the bathroom. I ask the way. I go down a long hall, in a sports department or a gymnasium at a college. A man shows me the way. I'm walking and wonder if I'll have enough energy. He opens a door and I see a basketball game in progress. The man points to across the room. We walk right through the middle of the game and get to the other side. We go down a dark dingy hall to the women's room. I go in. It's a huge room with one toilet. I sit. A woman came in and I wondered where she came from. I see a stairway up to the "real" bathroom. (194 words)

I am married to some rich guy. We have a huge house, lots of rooms. All the rooms have lots of dirty dishes. I am gathering up the dishes and taking them to the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with so much. I get a phone call. A woman asks me if I'll have typing work for her soon as she needs the money. She can work because Susan doesn't need her now. I think it is Judy and I say, "Sure, I'll have some work for you next week," but I'm really not sure if I will or what I'm doing with my work. I hang up and then I see Judy and realize I don't know the name of the person I was talking to. I remember then it was probably Dovre R. I then go up very broad carpeted stairs to see the second floor. It's a hotel. I see room after room. Women are in the rooms. One is named Emily. Some of the women are beautifully carved statues in rose or teak wood. They are lying or sitting in their beds. I go to the 3rd floor. There is a conference room. A blind woman sits talking to herself. I do not respond to her and move on. I see a door made of glass and wonder where it goes. I open it and test the floor. It opened into a small square closet-sized room. The floor is a trap door and opens to create a chute down to the auto bay where my husband works on his racing cars. I think, "I might have known." Another woman fell into the chute and lands in the auto bay, so we've been found out. I realize the chute is illegal, another bad thing my husband does. I hope he gets caught so we can sell the house, but a small cottage where there are fewer dishes to do and maybe I can write. (325 words)

I am at the beach. I sit on a rock, which is unstable and "rocky." The tide is coming in. I try to push the rock further into the sand for stability. I get up because it's not working and run/walk for the van because the waves are getting me wet. A man says, "The community college has a piece of the ocean." I say, "Oh yeah? Well, maybe at Florence." I go to the van. Ginny is in the driver's seat, so I start to get in the passenger side. She slides over to the passenger side so I hesitate and then get in the driver's side. I see lots of toys and candy and fun stuff hanging decoratively inside the van. I think it's cute. (127 words)

I'm at a grocery store hoping to meet a nice man I can be in relationship with. This short but good-looking guy comes up and kisses me. I say, "Hey, who are you? Don't do that." I walk away from him. He follows. I see Merle in a shopping cart. I tell him, "This boy came up and kissed me." Merle is a little jealous. I go back into the store looking for a guy. As I'm ready to leave, I find Raul and another guy. We walk out with Merle and Ginny and some others. I say to Raul, "Don't be like you were before; be natural and real." He agrees. Someone says, "To whose couch do we go?" I offer my house. We go to a campground. Raul says he's read about Emily Dickinson. I say, "Yeah, me too. She's into natural drugs." Some people take the campsite we were headed for. We get into a van and drive up a freeway exit the wrong way and cut across wooded area to park next to the original campsite. Ginny has money in her hand. I say, "There isn't any wood for the fire," and then I see some split logs and sticks. [BL] (204 words)

I am holding a newborn baby. Someone asks if she's eating, as her face is lying on my breast. I say, "No, she's sleeping." I hold her gently and lovingly. I lay her down on the couch. I wonder if she's safe there and decide she is, if she doesn't wake up and wiggle around. (55 words)

Bonnie is upset. She has a Japanese "niece" that lives with her and a Japanese man is moving her things out. I suspect that he is lying to us and really is taking the niece away and won't return. Bonnie is crying and saying, "I need my niece to help me. Please don't take her away." I say, "I knew when he first came here he intended to take her away." I go to the living room. I see Uncle Wilbur lazing on the couch. He wears a Hawaiian shirt. (90 words)

Arthur and I are in a room with other people. A woman is giving him a massage. He looks over at me and smiles warmly. He says the massage is good, but he remembers better ones, meaning mine from the past. Later, I am sleeping and he comes over and kisses me gently on the face. I pretend to be asleep. He knows I'm pretending. I murmur gently because it feels nice. Someone comes in and says, "Look at that plane!" I go to the door and see white powdery stuff coming out of the sky. Nuclear radiation. I stay under the porch roof. A man comes in; his face is covered with this stuff. We are concerned. He comes in and we help him wash it off. We hope he doesn't die from it. (135 words)
Barb Sanders:#1095 (11/09/88)

Bonnie and I are homeless. We have learned though. We have long johns and mittens, ear muffs, etc. I think, "Being without a home is better and safer because it's real. When we thought we had a home, we didn't protect from the cold because we believed we should be warm, even though there was no heat in the house. We walk upstairs and a stair, path through the woods. There are patches of snow and particles of dry wooden path. I am glad to see the dry patches, some places to sleep when we get tired. (97 words)
Barb Sanders:#1096 (11/10/88)

I go to visit someone for a while. The woman asks me if I think the style of her house is Western. I walk around looking at the outside of her house. At first I say, "Yes," but then I reconsider. I say, "No, a western style house would be more open. It would have large windows and clean, simple lines." At the back of her house I see flagstone siding and a small square enclosed porch with a high peaked roof. She says, "I never even use this space." I say, "I think your house is more Cape Cod." I then decide I want to take the day off to go home and relax, and to go swimming in the pool. I try to gather up my belongings and the people I came with. I can't seem to carry all my belongings, a basket of dirty laundry, some books and papers. The woman tries to help me. I call to Ellie who is up high on the tower roof of the nextdoor castle. She's starting to climb down the outside wall like repelling down a mountain. I am concerned for her. I think, "That sure is like Ellie, taking risks!" Dwight comes down and gets ahead of her so in case she falls, she'll land on him. She takes the last jump and does land on him. He is hurt. His foot might be broken. I go to them, concerned, and check out his foot. Now, we're on an airplane to go home. It's time to board and I'm still juggling all my stuff. She says, "It's time," and I say, "Well, I'm not on board yet." She says, "We have all the PhDs. Are you the one with three masters?" I say, "I only have one master." She reluctantly lets me on board. (305 words)

An oval metal elevator. We have to slide in like getting into a car through the window. It's crowded, with Tyler and me and lots of others. It tips and starts to malfunction. I feel scared. It is dark. I pray we make it to the floor level. We do, just barely. We get out and go to get lunch (or breakfast). I sit at a table. Chuck complains. I say, "How predictable you are, Chuck." A waitress comes up to take my order. I say, "This is new," and order deviled eggs and other things. (96 words)

Terence comes over to me and laughs because I didn't notice the tattoo on his nose and chest. I then see it. It is quite ornate and moves even, telling some story. He kisses me and wants to make love. I say, "Not now or here. Someone will come by." He frowns. I say, "You've got your 12-year-old face on." Some people do come by. He moves away from me. We go to the basement to find the spirits. I see lots of animal statues sitting in the sand. Some move. A statue of a man on a horse (very primitive) rides by. A blue sheep moves around. I send out psychic vibes to call all that think like me. I get a few philosophers interested. (126 words)

I go to see my brother Dwight's bedroom. It is his special place. There are lots of books about plants. His room is next to mine and a partition wall is between the rooms. Over the partition you can see shelves of bright, pretty books. I think, "So that's how he sees my room. It's an interesting perspective." I think it looks nice and he enjoys seeing them (the books). I am glad I can share this for him. (79 words)

An older man seems interested in me. We are on a cruise boat. I am flattered, but at the end of the ride I go away, not opening up to an opportunity to meet him again. I see some burros. A small, cute one is feisty and kicks his heels up just like real burros. I comment on how cute he is. Someone says, "Uh oh! You'll take it home!" I say, "Oh no. Not me." Then I notice it has some blood on its back. I feel concern. Next, I am walking back home with the burro as a cane. I comment that it is just the right height. I am concerned that when I get home, my parent will be upset and not accept the burro. Then I see Kirk Douglas who is upset at his son because the son had done some spectacular things and then just quit! He (the father) is going to have a talk with him and see if he can convince the son to get back on track. Now I see a small girl who had spent hours straightening up the nursery toys, lining them up and labeling them. She is very proud of her hard work and is waiting in excited anticipation for her parents to come and see and be proud of her. The burro is also waiting, hoping to be accepted. I feel sorry for them because Kirk Douglas is going to blast in there, with his single-minded energy aimed at the older son. The little girl and the burro are going to be ignored. (265 words)

I'm on a cruise boat. Jet planes streak by, the captain waving to look like he's personally waving at us, but it's just an act to look good. I am disgusted with them. They are really just mechanical, distant air heads. (41 words)

I'm going to teach a lecture on forest fires to a 3rd (4th is crossed out) grade class. I am practicing the lecture with their teacher. I am apologizing that I don't have much content information. I go to the library to find an encyclopedia to get more information. I'm going to show maps and talk about how the fires burn off all the old tangled growth that leaves room for new growth. Then, as we are going to the classroom, the thing shifts and we are now going to a cafe, De Frisco's, to reminisce on the Germany Trip with 3 or 4 other women. We sit around a table. I suggest another member of the Germany group show her pictures. But just before she starts, I pull mine out and start with the Palace of Versailles. I find as I start talking, I have lots to say and it is interesting to the others. Then we decide to play baseball. I hit a ball and run for first base and was nearly "put out." The base was real close. Then I show someone a lovely wooden panel I was allowed to bring back from Paris. It fit on top of a piano we had here. Then we had to move a table that had pretty things on it back to make more room for second base. The table leg slipped and some things fell. We decided we'd meet again to finish our talks as we'd already been there 4 hours. I wrote the names of the ones who will speak and in what order. I consulted with Rena who said she would do her talk if she'd had enough to drink. [BL] (283 words)

Bonnie and I are offered a job. We take it, thinking, "This will be a cinch!" As we walk toward the lake with our male guide, I start to feel uneasy and unsafe. I am on a wooden sidewalk and as I get close to the lake I see a huge and horrible monster like a giant squid thing in the lake. I realize this man guide is not going to be able to keep me safe and I can't back out of the job. I am very afraid and try to hide behind a door. The monster comes out of the lake and now is a very tall and huge man. He comes to collect and eat the women who have been hired to dance and entice him out of the lake. Even though another woman is dancing, he sees me behind the door and comes after me. I run and find a town. I become a dancer on stage. I realize it is time to go back to the monster. I start to go back, but decide I can't do it and go hide. I am going home, but I'm peeking through the door cautiously for fear the monster is there. I think I smell him, but it is Grandpa Lloyd. Then a door opens to the dining room and I see my parents. I think, "Oh no, not them. I'm not ready to meet them yet." (239 words)

My cat has swirls of hot pink fur, especially on her chest. She lays on me in despair, talking of suicide. We are on a playing field on the inside of a running track. Some people are playing ball and the ball keeps falling near us. We ignore them but wonder if they are annoyed with us. Then I see a group of fat, some disabled women, doing exercises all in a row. Then I see my cat riding on the back of a strange broad-backed horse around the track, running somewhat difficultly and catching up to a group of track runners. (102 words)

A teacher has two students who are laying down on her left. The teacher is addressing an audience of parents who are in a semi- circle around her. I am in the audience on her right. She tells the parents she wants their permission to interpret the students and the parents would accept what they say. The parents feel uncomfortable and say no. The teacher looks perplexed. I suggest that I could help the teacher understand if I could interpret what the parents were trying to say. Then I see a huge mechanical alien thing looking in the window. It sucked our consciousness out of our bodies and put each of us in a metal oval container to take us all to their world. I escape my container and dart around invisible, keeping all of my molecules together so I didn't vaporize all over the place. I follow the mechanical alien as it goes to talk to its followers. Then a human-like male, the real King, enters and takes over. He's very good-looking and I'm interested in him (attracted to him?). I come up close to his head to observe and feel him. He is very self-centered. He and his father talk about the missing human consciousness and aren't overly concerned. The father is concerned about the unfeeling, self-centered son. The man goes to take a bath and gets an erection. He laughs, calls to his guard to send him in Angela (the next woman). She comes in and they make love. I am excited by it all and try to enter his head to hear what he thinks. (269 words)

I walk past a man and drop eye contact. As I enter my room, I realize he could be a nice guy and I never gave him a chance. So I go back and smile. He comes in and hugs me. Then we look around the room. There are lots of snapshots put together like an art collage on the walls. He says I'm very good at my art. (I say, "Oh, I like to use repetition of pictures to make a point and some things just happened intuitively, not planned.") He points to one where the kids look like they are sliding down a waterfall. There are also lots of clothes piled up in the sink. I start sorting them. The baby things I put in a pile to save for the next grandchild. I hang up the blouses in an already crowded closet. I see an apple pie and think, "Oh good, but I'd better eat it." I see some chocolate chip cake stuff in the sink and feel a little annoyed that Arvonne has these goodies (with sugar) and I can't and she's wasting food. (188 words)

The house is a mess. I am walking down the road and someone comes by me and says I left the house unlocked and keeps on going.

I go off alone to watch a movie or something. (73 words)

I am watching a performance by a bright and spangly-dressed performer. I get bored and decide to leave. I go out in the lobby area. A mentally retarded man asks where's the lady with the magic that turns the lights on for him? I say, "She's still performing. You'll have to wait." I push him away as he's trying to hug me. I go out to look for the car. Someone parked it far away. It looks like Dovre's car. I get in, the passenger side. I can't get the safety belt to work. We can't go until it does work. I am frustrated. Some one from the back seat tries it. I get sarcastic. Finally, it works and we can go home. (123 words)

I am at a party. I think it's a birthday party for a baby but it is for this guy. I go to sit at a table. When I sit, my chair is in the outside wall of their apartment and the other chairs at the table and the table is on the inside of the wall. I sit and pull the wall over me so I'm on the inside too. The wall must be of a stretch material with a hole in it. The irony is that when I pull myself through the wall, the birthday boy gets his head caught in a similar stretch hole. I think it looks strange. We start to eat breakfast. He asks me questions and it becomes evident he doesn't know how to run a self-publishing business. I ask him if he keeps records or receipts. He looks confused. I set out to help him set up his business better. (157 words)

I had bought some gifts for the girls and was dividing them up. They are on the couch in a pile. I can't find the rainbow gift I got for one of the girls. I see Indian beaded belts and things (red beads. The kids are playing and I go out to the sidewalk. A man (Howard) mouths to me, "What do you want to do?" I mouth back, "Let's go someplace alone." He smiles and goes into the house to get ready. One of the children is playing in a red parked car and I get in the car to play with her, but then she drives us away. I am surprised and say, "Where are we going?" She says, "To this other place across town." I get angry and say, "No. I want to go back. We were going to be alone." She just keeps driving. We stop at a store and I go in. She says, "Come on, let's go. I say, "No. I'm staying here. I'll find a phone and call him. He'll come and get me." She shrugs and leaves. I feel very brave because I could get stranded here. I ask if I can use the phone. A little old lady says yes. I can't find the phone number. I look and look. I ask her to help me. She can't find it either. The name is Ted Wright. I see advertisements for the Disabled Students Union in the phone book. (247 words)

I am working for this very good-looking guy. The office is a mess. Piles of things are on the desk. I am trying to straighten it out and can't figure out where to put things. I pick up a poster and hang it on the wall. My boss stands close to me and as he is talking, I am aware of how attracted I am to him. I wonder how I can get his attention so he'll like me and find me attractive. He says, "That's a poster of Tony and someone is coming to the office that doesn't like Tony." I say, "Uh oh! Guess it was a mistake to put the poster up." He and I walk down some stairs. We start to walk through a cafe, but it is closed. Then we walk through the college bookstore to find the rest of the stairs. We continue our walk. We are now more like a couple. He wants some sunglasses and sees some on the side of the path. He chooses one that belonged to the S children. Somehow that was OK because the glasses came from descendants of Darryl. (192 words)

I am in a house and it is crowded with lots of things and furniture. A small bird and a large blow fly come rushing in. I think it's a bee but someone reassures me it's a fly. There is a mask in a basket with a lid. I give it to a small boy and he takes it outside and dumps the old, musty, moldy mask. I feel relief. Suddenly the house is nearly empty. Lots of space. Only a stove moved in from a rental (our original old stove) and a table are left and I like it this way. The boy brings back the empty basket and I almost accept it back, but change my mind and give him the basket. I don't want it because it carries the odor and feel of the mask. I am outside. Two guys are up a telephone pole fixing the lines. They are hanging up there in a way that seems impossible, but they seem comfortable. One is there to "spot" the other guy in case he gets in trouble. They finish and come down the ladder and efficiently pack up their equipment. It was very graceful; each knew how to do each task and they just did whatever was closest at hand. I ride my wheelchair around their truck watching them and then I go to my front door and park the chair and walk in. [BL] (237 words)

I am at a table. I pour sugar-frosted shredded wheat things into a bowl. I pick up a cup with a drop or two of tea in it. Dwight says, "I'll get you some more tea." I say, "Thanks." Paulina is on my right. He gives me back the cup and I see that there is barely enough tea to cover the bottom of the cup. I feel robbed and say, "There isn't very much to eat here." My mother says, "Don't be silly. Let me see." I hand her the cup, which is now a huge glass bowl. As I hand it to her I feel a little embarrassed because I realize it is the size of the bowl that makes it seem I haven't enough tea. I drink the tea and realize I've picked up the wrong container and I had started to sip from a bag of coffee beans. I spit it out and wonder if all this sugar and coffee will hurt me. I then drink my herbal tea. (173 words)

I am packing to go home. My mother and Paulina are helping. I am surprised there is so much stuff. I didn't come with this much. They had packed two empty suitcases in one of my boxes. I say, "We can take those out." My mother disagrees. She says, "I'll need them when I go to the bank." I say, "No, I won't." I feel angry. Then I see a box with all the family violins in it. I can't play my own, much less theirs. I take them anyway. Then they take a video picture of me playing a violin. It is pretty. My small daughter has a baby violin and is trying to learn to play. She breaks a string and it sounds terrible. I am glad they made this video for me. Then I go around, checking if we'd left anything behind. I see lots of papers I don't need and the hot pink sexy dress Lydia gave me. I think, "Well, it'll be here if I need it." We leave. (174 words)

It is raining very hard and I decide to drive to L.C.C. The traffic on the freeway is very heavy and I almost do get let into the line of traffic. The road has dangerous broken places that are not marked and hard to see. I think, "How foolish to be out here at all," but there I am. I am now driving up hill and I see the river. I suddenly realize there are waves coming, flooding. I am now on top of the hill in a hotel. I see several waves and ten I see a tidal wave crashing over the river. The water comes clear up to the lawn of my hotel! I am surprised and think, "I may still be in danger up here." I go to look out the windows. Then I go to the living room. There are two small children wanting to play with the books and toys. I take away a toy I think is dangerous and offer them cars and books. (170 words)

After work we are driving to where we will stay. It turns out we are going home to N City rather than stay over in the city for the night. We are driving backwards down a curvy hill. I am in the back. I say, "Lookout!" I see our back wheel has gone over the edge and we are teetering. I feel scared and in danger. I realize I can get out of the car. I crawl out of the top, which is on its side. The car doesn't fall, but I see the tracks and realize how close to danger I was! (103 words)

My taxi driver takes off his clothes and dives into his own river. He is happy and relieved to be in his own river and not mine. His river has forked off mine. He calls his river "Pegasus." He floats along in oblivion. His nose hinges up so he can lay face down and still breathe. He's not watching where he's going and I see he's headed into a slough with lots of brown foam on it. I pull him out and save his life. He is appreciative. (88 words)

I am driving a sort of golf cart thing. A man and woman in the back are sort of hugging, but the woman needs to leave the man because his hugs are so strong, they are physically damaging and dangerous. She runs for my cart and I start up the engine, hoping we can escape the man. I am afraid. She gets in and we drive away. I say, "Which way?" and she says, "C City." I say, "Good. That's the direction I'm going." We come to a river and I nearly drive the cart right in. I hit the brakes and teeter on the edge of the road. The bridge man says, "You could go over the top freeway." I say, "It's longer that way. I'll just go across. It won't take as long." Then I say, "It sure will be cold" and I imagine the cold, dark green water. I grab the boat, which is more like a Frisbee now, and we go across as fast as we can. We only get a little wet and I think, "There, that wasn't so bad." Some one asks how close Dalles is to C City. I say, "Not far." (199 words)

I am teaching a workshop. A cute man is interested in me. I finish one section and during the break I go up to the 4th floor on the elevator. He comes with me. I am standing on a bed reaching up to a shelf to get my things. He is sleeping on the bed. He wakes up and is delighted to see me there. He smiles and hugs my legs trying to pull me to him. I am attracted and we tease. I push the button for the elevator. It comes. It is small, tall, and narrow. We get in and I say, "This is like being in a coffin." We get to the basement where I'm to teach the next seminar. Lots of people are there. I want to find a bathroom. All there is, is a toilet with no door and a see-through curtain. I call a group of women over to stand around me, holding up articles of clothing. They laugh and joke. After I am through, a woman comes up and hands me a dime. I had just dropped some pennies and was glad to get rid of them because I had no pocket. She's buying 10 pingpong balls to play a game. Then I see a cabinet with a tiny black and white TV set in it like an old 1940's set. I comment on it. (232 words)

I come to a Halloween party dressed as Marilyn Monroe in my hot pink dress, wig and mask. A man is waiting impatiently for me to arrive. I slink into the room, very sexy. He looks, but then glances at the back door and says, "Where's B?" He didn't recognize me. I feel pleased that I'm hearing him pine for me. Then he points out the window. There is a river out there and a tree. A branch has been carved to look like a horse's head with the branch continuing out of its mouth. (You have a drawing here.) It drops a black package into the river. The man wants the thing, and without thinking I dive into the river and get the package. The woman thinks I'm brave. I get out of the river and go to a room to dry off and fix myself up, only I'm not very wet which is surprising. Now I'm doing some dishes with my daughter (Paulina). I get a steel wool coil caught in my fingernail. We work at removing it. Then I'm lying on a couch and my "favorite" baby is laying on my tummy and we are talking. (199 words)

Then Jake and I and some guy are going to take a big heavy machine to T City. We try to load it into the back of our red vehicle. It's too long.

I am at a beach looking out across the sand toward the ocean. I see a family, a woman seated in a beach chair with her children playing near her. The older child (like Dovre) notices the water bottle is empty and takes it to fill it with more drinking water. After she leaves, the woman has a seizure and stands up looking for her water bottle. She can't find it and needs to drink water to ease the seizure. She is very angry at the children. She calls them stupid and worthless. She comes up near me and sits by me, telling her small child he is worthless. The child winces and I feel empathy and sadness for the child. I tell the woman, "This isn't right." I lecture her on how the child will hear her words and try to live up to them. "So you should tell your child positive things." Dovre returns with a full bottle of water and some food. Everyone eats. The woman had been angry at me at first but was now agreeing with me. I decide I'm hungry and the food is gone, so I ask where she got the food. "The little store, but they haven't much of a selection," she answers. So I go into the little store. Bakery goods or packaged snack junk food - cookies, cakes, corn chips, pretzels, etc. I notice then a door, and through the door I see a small town's main street. I edge near the door peering, thinking maybe there's a restaurant or another store with more nutritious food, but decide it's too much work. I decide to find something in here. There is a shelf of little old-fashioned TVs. The owners are looking at me suspiciously like I might grab something and run through the door. I get some stuff and go back to the family. Now "I" am a woman waiting at the table and a drunk young man returns with the food. There is a bowl of good fresh milk on the table. He ("I") drink some with a ladle. It tastes very good and refreshing. He feels thirsty. I now watch him try to talk. He is drunk or acting drunk. He has a card in his mouth to help him talk slurred. He then stands and tells the group that he loves me and he kisses me tenderly on my cheek. I think, of course, he's so affectionate, he's drunk, but I'm touched. I then see an outline of a theory written like on a blackboard. A ........... I say, "If someone is loved at A and their parents had given them a good message, then when it's over, they, after mourning, can move into B and feel love again." Judith is lecturing about the importance of parental positive conditioning. (472 words)

One detail I left out of my dream last night I didn't even write in my dream journal, it seemed so silly and I couldn't see that it meant anything. It was a blue advertisement card with white lettering on it, and it was in a drunk man's mouth as he told me he loved me. So as I was eating breakfast, I was thinking about that card and describing it in my mind, "Blue with white lettering" and I look up to the fruit baskets hanging above the toaster and see a blue card with white lettering. I read the words. They are: "Nobody takes care of you better than you." "Ha!" says I, startled. The cosmos does it again. What an interesting series of internal events to get me to notice what is in front of my face every morning! (142 words)

A man (feminine-looking) sits on the floor. I am attracted to him a little. I sit down next to him. We kiss. Each time I kiss him on the mouth, he pulls away. I say "What am I doing wrong?" He says, "Nothing. It's just that I'll have an orgasm." He looks around for a place we can make love. He points to a closet door and then to a trap door in the ceiling. I shake my head no and point to my bedroom door. We get up and walk into the bedroom. There is a kitchen in there. I open a cupboard and see piles of old cereal boxes. I realize Ellie has left her mess there. I realize I don't eat the cold cereal anymore. I now go upstairs and have hot cereal. I open a package and lemon lifesavers come out and a Hershey bar. A boy stares at the food and I push him away. Then I think, "Oh. I don't eat chocolate. I should have given the bars to him." The woman says she is the Admiral's wife and watches the man to see his reaction. He is startled because he thought she was the Captain's wife. (203 words)

I am swimming across a huge expanse of tar, and if I stop to rest I will sink in, so I keep swimming even though I'm quite tired. Finally, I reach the shore and lay upon wet, soft grass, as soft waves of the clean, clear ocean lap near me. I clutch the grass to affirm I am finally safe and can rest. Just then I realize I'd spent all summer swimming and now it was time to go to school. I had no time to rest! I get up and now I'm dressed in a red plaid pleated wool skirt and a brown corduroy jacket. I am dressed different than all my peers. It is the beginning of the senior year. No one likes me. I dress and act differently. As a joke, they had invited me to be their class president. I go into the auditorium. I go up to the podium and tell them I know they don't like me and I don't like them but I am their President and I will make it work. Some guy in the back throws spit balls and is noisy and rude. A guy in front stands up and is rude. I walk up to him and nose to nose (he's very tall) I look up and say, "Look here, you little punk..." the crowd backs me and he quiets down. (231 words)

I am writing on a cushion I've drawn pictures on. I use a blue pen, that can't xerox. The pictures are like embroidery or needlepoint. I step back to see what it looks like. You can hardly see the writing. There is a small round cushion on the square large outside cover. I consider getting a better-fitting inside piece. A daughter asks me a favor to go with her to exchange a bottle at a store. I tell her I'm tired and have much to do, but we go, with several wives of my ex-husband. It's 1 or 2 in the morning. I look around in the store/tower and see lots of women looking or waiting for someone. We go to the next store. Lovely glassware and in the back of the store, plastic things, like laundry baskets. I comment on the juxtaposition. We go on. I find a name of a man who's looking for a roommate. I knew him. My father suggests I move in with him. I shrug. It's time to xerox something, but some papers fall on the glass and need to be moved quickly as I've already pushed the start button. I tell my father impatiently to help me. He is slow and ineffective. I then do it myself. (214 words)

Ellie and I are at school and are visiting a friend at her house. The friend tells Ellie she's been taking advantage of her and is selfish. Ellie had asked for some food and stuff. So Ellie gathers up some toys and gives them to the friend's kids. The friend says, "Good, you needed to give up the toys anyway." I then see a pack of Lucky Strike cigs and ask for one to borrow. She says no. I then say "Ellie, why don't you go to the store and buy me some Salems?" Then the friend is packing to go to Europe. The TV cameras are here to get our reactions to her. I put on a scarf. And a woman says, "You look good, scarfed." I see that it is shaped like a veiled Arab woman's scarf and all you can see is your eyes. Then the scarf keeps slipping and becomes a piece of wet folded up newspaper I hold over my mouth. It's my turn to talk to the cameras. I had watched a quad man fall to the ground and tell a man he loved him only to discover he was talking to a brown paper sack with a wig in it. I go to the camera and say, "I first met ___ and I had to think hard to remember my friend's name Lisa, in class. I had my Masters in Counseling and she was getting hers." I said how much I loved her and her family (lots of siblings). I describe her huge house and the ramps and all her nice brothers and sisters. (271 words)

I am organizing and fixing my room. I have piles of things on a desk, and I take one thing at a time off the pile and put it where it belongs. I create shelves and put boxes of sorted things up on the shelf. Framed pictures of Grandpa Lloyd and Grandma Mildred are arranged on my desk. Three pictures of enlarged snapshots of some man, his head in different positions and moods are on the wall. (B has drawn three pictures in the journal.) I move a few chairs and a dresser. When I am through, I feel very happy and pleased. I go into the next room, which is a kitchen, and feel so happy as I see shelves of books and everything the way I like it. Howard picks me up and holds me. He wants to have sex and is desperate. He runs down the hall, carrying me so we can get to the bedroom downstairs before I stop being happy. I feel so sad and trapped because even though my body is hungry for sex, I can't enjoy it with Howard and I must have sex with him because he needs and demands it, so I feel trapped! My solution is to lie on top of him and caress us both so that I am giving or forcing my body to feel the physical experiences, but emotionally all I feel is trapped, disgusted and sad. (240 words)

A man said to me, "You shouldn't take pills in public where kids can see you." I make a sarcastic remark that people can take pills in restaurants. It's not against the law.

Another guy and I laugh and say, "Wouldn't it be better to start with an educational relationship and then move to girl/boy friend and then to marriage?" I grimace at the idea of marriage.

I get into the back of my van and suddenly I see a man in a corner. He steps toward me with the intention of raping me. At first I feel resigned and paralyzed, not knowing what to do. And then I start screaming, "Help!" as loud as I can. He realizes I'll fight back, so he leaves. I quickly shut doors and lock them, glancing nervously at the corner he came from and drive away. I come to a river and get out. I have to get on a bus to cross. I climb up the stairs in great pain, asking if there are any seats near the back. I crawl over people and choose not to sit by some guy. I didn't like the way he looked. Then I am in a house and a man intends to have sex with me. I am not in agreement, but somehow I know I have to. There is some antagonistic and prideful remark I make. I'll at least keep my pride and dignity. I go upstairs and see a turd in the toilet. I then see a movie and say, "That's not a good movie for me to see now." It's about someone who must use their talents to their full potential and someone who gives up and doesn't. I say to him, "You don't think I'm going to make it easy for you, do you?" (236 words)

I put a newspaper around my upper leg and come to her saying, "I want you to see something." She looks. I am wearing the newspaper her father put out and it is too small. The seam is splitting. She gets the message that she has outgrown her father's words and beliefs. I go back to my spot to take a nap, thinking I'd like to be by the ocean too. (143 words)

I am at an intersection on the hill and see a fast current in a large body of water. I think, "What a lovely view; someone should build a house here." Just then a train, huge and noisy, rushes close by. "Oh," I say, "I see now why no one builds here." I see lots of trains and nearly get run over by one. I veer off and see a slough. I am walking with a man and I call out to warn him that sloughs can be dangerous like quicksand, but not as bad because it doesn't suck you all the way under. I also remember about Abner and catching frogs and our promise to marry when we grew up. We go around the slough to the house. (157 words)

I am in a set of four rooms. The dining room is never used. I am surprised and ask Bonnie why not. She says it's too much trouble. I see Phyllis G. who is helping me with my paperwork. I want to give her the Barry Stevens book she likes. I write an inscription on the inside and then realize I wrote it on the wrong book. It's a children's coloring book. So I ask her to read it and pretend it's on the right book and then I give her the right book. I then must drive many miles on a bumpy dirt road to get to my word processor. It's a van/bus and a woman is driving. Without even stopping, she gets up and crawls out the passenger side of the van near me and runs up to the stop sign. I know this is normal procedure and wait patiently as we drive leaderless up to the sign where she will hop in and continue to drive. Lydia, in the back seat, is startled and cried out, "Look out! What's she doing?" I explain to her. (188 words)

She says, "Can't you see how they are so concerned about traffic?" I said, "Those are two different issues, Mom (I feel frustrated). The first one is about Identity, the second about confusion (or something). She dismissed my idea. I feel angry. A cute little automated machine comes in and bumps into things in its search for something to dust, because that's what it's been invented to do. It finds a picture frame and starts to wipe at it. At first all it does is move the dust around. I report this to someone. Then after a long time it actually makes it squeaky clean and dust free. I am impressed. (179 words)

One room had birds, some memory in it, and when I poked my head in, I could hear the bird song. The next room was scary. I could feel it, but I opened the door anyway and a cute yellow plastic ghost rushed up to the door on a string. I laughed. I saw a bathroom with two tubs. A door opened. I saw a flight of stairs to a cocktail bar. I see the arm of a man on the banister. He's leaning over to see me. I shut the door quickly. (117 words)

They agree and then Erik starts making funny faces and acting goofy. He hides and plays in my writing office. Lewis and I keep trying to talk him into seriousing up. Then my rehearsal group arrives. Some woman like Mabel really wants my attention. I try to pay attention to both groups. I see a list of author's names and see Dammitt and Akin. I then check the newsletter to see if they are the same as the winners. They are. Lucy comes in and wants to tell me all about the fact that when she falls asleep she acts like a little girl and either masturbates or gets sexually excited and now she's afraid to go to sleep.

I realize it is Czechoslovakia. I see a fancy limo convertible car go by with war officers in it. I'm in the back of a bus with the others from the place. The officer and I catch eye and I say, "Uh oh! We've made eye contact and now we're in trouble. He's noticed us." We go into a hotel to hide. I pick up a New Testament and replace it and pick up my old Bible my parents gave me at birth, and a new prayer book (Episcopalian).

I am setting up a meal. I notice that the glasses are dirty, so I start to wash them in the sink. I clean off dried-on gunk. One cup is pink and collapses like those traveling cups. I turn to Paulina who is already seated at the table and ask if she wants that cup. She says, "No, it is limp and collapses on itself," (like a limp penis). Dwight comes in and says, "Ah, my favorite kind of fudge." "Yeah," I say, "I made it!" I scrape off the dried skin and a pudding, vanilla-like substance is seen. "It's my remoldable kind," I say. I go into my bedroom looking for the table. It's out back. We get it and bring it in. I then shout and try to lock the back bedroom door. It is hard to lock and I feel concerned. I won't feel safe until it's locked. It finally clicks. I go to the dining room. Pancakes and syrup are already on the plates. Dwight says, "I like a picnic." He then comments on the nuns and how they are out in all kinds of weather (rain, sleet hail, snow, and gardening and then they complain because their knees and joints hurt). (206 words)

He says it's the latest, best model and opens a luggage case and pulls out the stamps, money and tickets. I comment that I am 45 minutes late. He says there's a $32.50 charge for the use of these materials. I am surprised and not pleased. He changed it to $3.50. I don't check it out. I need the stuff, so I decide I settle up with him later. I go and see lots of people going into the dance. I say, "I've got the tickets," but no one buys. I go in and announce they can buy their tickets now, but still they ignore me.

I carefully climb down and then notice my brothers got back on the roof. I call "The Birds" together to discuss the two upcoming programs. I tell them I made a mistake. We have a one-hour show at 3:30 and then at 4:30 another show across town. If we only do 40 minutes, we can do it. There are 7 of us so if each does 6 minutes, we'd be OK.

I won't fit." She assures me it is. Then I ask her to look again. "Oh," she says, "It's still partly zipped." I get the dress on, but it's strapless and I have a regular bra on. Ellie says, "Go get your special thing." I take off my bra and go to get my strapless bra, only I pick up a pair of swim goggles and lay it across my breasts and laugh. I see my hair, which is now totally gray. My eyes are a faded, tired blue. I am appalled. I straighten the curls Grandma had fixed into the hairdo. I hope my aunts return soon to take their rightful place in the outfit. (157 words)

A man comes out to help me put on my shoes (black high heels with straps) I have an umbrella hat and I don't do the straps, the audience is just going to have to accept this idiosyncrasy. The applause is weak and dries out. Then I decide to do an encore. It's my best piece, a ballad, soft and sweet; then it tells a musical story of children being good and then mischievous. (122 words)

A group of people are in a circle, two of them in wheelchairs. A man teacher asks students if they are prepared for today's lesson. He asks a boy in a wheelchair. The boy says, "Oh, I couldn't because I didn't get my check yet." "You understand," the teacher responds. "No Gary, I don't. I speak English." Then there is a toy-like game. I'm it. Someone puts a thing in my arm and I drive around in my chair, lamenting, "I can only go 4.8 m.p.h. How can I win?" Everyone else is running and faster. Somehow I do manage to keep out of their way.

I have 2 children, a girl about 4 years old and a boy about 2 years old. I tell the girl, who is clamoring for my attention, to wait; I have to deal with the boy right now because he's being bad. I see his round, sassy face and I slap him. "Listen to me," I say. I slap him again and again. "I know what you are doing up there." He lives in some institutions. "I'm going to keep you here with me until you shape up and behave right." He's not happy about that. [BL] (96 words)

I'm on a rented bus. It's a women's study group. There are 7 men on the bus. I stand up, counting them. That's better than it used to be. Used to be only one or two men would attend that kind of class. One man says it would be better if we made it more comfortable for men to attend. I sit down and Ellie and the baby come to sit next to me. I hold the baby while Ellie crawls over me to get into the window seat. I lick on the baby's ice cream cone. Then it's time to get off. I now watch as a quad man goes to visit the house of a quad woman named Ruby. The bottom half of her house had been burnt. The structure still stands but the boards are charred. I lie on a grassy hill and look up at a beautiful silhouetted scene and say, "I wish I had a camera!" It was the profile of a woman and a child and another figure. I then roll over and eat some pancakes with syrup on it. I get back to the bus, only now I have to leave it and go walk to E City. It was a one-way cruise. I start walking. The bus owner comes up and says someone broke the vacuum cleaner and will I pay for it? (231 words)

There is a raging, swollen river and I am to float down it. I have a guide. She says, "You sure are scared." I said, "Yes, I am." She couldn't understand why I'd be afraid. I was afraid I'd go under and be drowned. I see a boat going down river. It's dragging a long chain, like a bicycle chain. A loop of it catches on my right big toe and almost pulls me with it but I unloop it from my toe. Then I dive in and rush down stream. I get out. An Asian man is there. I have a list of places I saw on my travels. Mile post ----- is one of the entries. He speaks German and so do I, except toward the end I slip into Spanish. (133 words)

A woman in a wheelchair had an accident that injured the soles of her feet, so she has trouble walking. She puts on a brown leotard swimsuit and goes out to the pool to swim. It's 10 p.m. and I think, "I'll bet that water's cold. Glad I'm not out there." I feel tired. I go into the kitchen and wash a bowl or two. My grandma Mildred is there. The soap is very good and even takes off dried-on oatmeal. Some voice explains there are more dishes and I don't want to do them all. I look at my Grandma Mildred and confront her, "You think I'm being lazy! You don't think my arthritis is a good enough reason, do you, do you?" She hems and ha's, is passive-aggressive and indirect. I don't let her get away with it. "Look me right in the eyes and tell me," I command. I keep at it. She's now crouched behind the sink cowering from me. She finally admits that's what she thinks. She leaves the room quickly to go sit on the roof of the chicken house with the kids. I smile and say, "She'll get over it." I feel a little guilty for being so rough and scaring her. (209 words)

There are many rooms in a house. I walk toward the bathroom. I am playing a musical instrument, like a guitar or mandolin. I say, "Look, I just relax and don't think, and the music comes up from my memory." I am pleased. I start to walk into the bathroom and my mother is in there putting on her clothes. I see her "bush" as she pulls up her pants. I turn around quickly and say, "I'm sorry. I'll wait." She says, "It's OK." I go in and look around the room. There is an old-fashioned bath tub, the room is large. I think, "I can put in big beautiful plants." There is a window with an ornate, carved, gold leaf frame over it. A mirror has the same decoration. I think about curtains and remember white gauze like curtains lying on the floor outside in the hall. I go back out and realize I've placed my bedroom clear across the house and it is inconvenient. I see a door next to the bathroom and think, "I'll bet this would be a good bedroom." I open the door. It's not as pretty as I wanted it to be - empty bookshelves, white paint, ordinary. I step in and then notice an alcove with a bed in it off the main room. It was neat. I turn and see clothes hanging on the door, a red striped shirt. I think, "How wonderful dreams are to create all this detail." I see another alcove and go to explore. I turn on the light and at first it is dark. Then I try to will it light, and then it's bright, reality-like light. It was like I'd woken up and was seeing my own room, and then went back to the dream room. (300 words)

Lucy needs a lawyer. Michael J. Fox (Darryl) takes on the job. He and I are crossing a huge river on a bridge. I see a prehistoric rhino go into the river. "Nice neighborhood," I say sarcastically. The bridge becomes a stairway in a high-rise office building. At first we are going down to leave the building, but then we change and are going up to get to the protection of his father's office. I am glad because then our relationship has a chance. The furniture is rich and lovely. We sit in the dining room. Later, a secretary shows us where the spare blankets and rollaway bed is, only now we're stuck with her. She has three pink poodles, one a male. We laugh at how silly they look! Then, there's a whole crowd of people with us. I remember the lights are on and maybe someone outside has noticed and will come rescue us. I am embarrassed that I'd not thought to flash the lights to signal for help (I am aware I really didn't want help). The elevator now starts to work, but breaks down again. Everyone else uses the elevator. I hang back hoping to be last, with him. [BL] (203 words)

I am listing things I am upset about and thinking about them. I am interrupted by a group of children coming into my room and talking and eating my chocolate chip cookies. I get up and tell them to leave my cookies alone. I try to tell my mother my concerns and feelings. I don't feel like she's listening. She interrupts and lectures. I see a baby and I pee on her diaper. She looks at me. Then I go into the bathroom. I see a book written by a woman and start to read it. I then do my affirmations. "I am healthy. I am healing. I am a good writer." I then smiled and felt very good and continued, "I am an excellent writer." I felt very happy and confident. Then I hear Ellie telling her problems to my mother and I hear her doing the same thing she did to me. We are at Grandma Mildred's house. They go out on the front porch. I join them and tell my mother to be a good listener, to not lecture. I then tell Ellie to be more direct and ask for what she needs. (196 words)

I am naming the woman I flirted with and liked as I pass my hand over a pile of veggie stuff in a freezer. I do that twice and when I call her name, the freezer compartment is nearly empty and cold. I feel desolate. I get on my horse to go to another town. My horse must walk down a stair like "carnival ride" apparatus. Then the horse had to sit on its ass and slide the rest of the way. I am impressed with the horse's ability and feel badly that I put it through so much difficult maneuvering. (172 words)

So I go down the hall and round the corner and see my "husband" seated with his buddies in a tavern. I am looking in through a window. So I signal to him.

Something interesting is happening and a crowd of people have gathered in a circle. I drive my wheelchair around trying to find a place where I can get in to see.

Then I find a hole and another woman and I get in to see. Then I leave, now I'm walking and leaving the group. I am going to my car. A young man leans into the window of my car and starts talking. His name is John. He suggests we go for a drive. He gets in and drives. We're out on a country road talking and I'm aware he's looking for a place to park so we can kiss. I wonder why I'm there. He pulls over and scoots over and kisses me. It is gentle and tender. I turn away and say no, and push him away. He persists. I feel his need and love. I say, "You're a student at the community college and a young man. I'm an old woman. NO." He still wants me. Then I tell him to get out. He draws a map so I can find my way back. I get in the driver's seat and the car slides down a narrow, bumpy, dirt trail that has masses of blueprints and office papers all over the road.

A girl has a small calico type short hair cat. I say, "Let me pet her. I'll bet I can tame her. She'll calm down and we'll like each other." I stroke her gently.

I explain to her that her son responds to his two mothers differently. I think he responds to me better. Then President Bush comes through (it's like the old M City house) to the bathroom where he explains he keeps extra sets of clothes so in case he needs to change to accommodate a new person or situation, he can. Then he's in another narrow, long room. He says, "There's a lady here, what shall I wear? Shall I wear a dress?" He holds up an ugly polyester dress. My husband and I shake our heads no! How are we going to keep him from making a fool of himself by wearing inappropriate clothes? The first wife runs in and gets up on the counter and I say, "Oh no! She'll mess up his dinner."

I'm in my van and I see I'm near Rita H's house. I decide to visit. I drive backwards up a little hill and over gravelly stones. Her house is very tiny. I see her in the kitchen. She is all pink, even her hair. She's talking with some older woman. I apologize for interrupting. I am aware she's hiding someone in another room and I don't want to make trouble for her. (73 words)

I am a cripple and I sit down on the sidewalk in front of a store to wait for my friend. I have packages of popcorn the seam of the sack is burst and I'm spilling popcorn. The fat owner of the shop comes out and wants me to leave. We are in France and I can't remember any French. So I say, "Ich have ein Freund." But I couldn't remember enough German to say, "Who will meet me here?" So I switch to Spanish and say, "Punto aqui." A man walking by tries to help translate. Then I say, "Oh, here's my friend." I see her down the street. I gather up my packages and walk to meet her. Her name is Susan. Now I'm going to introduce her to this woman. I say, "This is Susan," and the woman says, "Oh! I know her." They had met before. [BL] (150 words)

Now I'm part of a tour. I am standing outside a store window, watching the actors do several scenes. A man and woman are acting. Suddenly he breaks from the rehearsal scene and sits in a chair and then gets up and puts her in the chair. She is trying to keep her composure and stick with the script. Then she backs up to a wall and says to him, "I hate it when you scare me." I watch this as a counselor and think, "No, that's not right." I can help her. I see a paper that fans are writing on and I see the actress's name is Barb V. I say to the woman tour guide, "What a coincidence. My name is Barb and my last name is Sanders. But my maiden name was V." (I was thinking that wasn't explained right. Actually V. was my mother's maiden name.) So I explain this in the paper and tell her that it wasn't the guy that scared her. It was her choosing to back up to the wall and be scared that was the problem! I figured she'd not see this for a long time and I went back to this house I was staying at. We were going on a trip on the bus, so now I'm very short and plump and have short hair, my name is Barb. I go to my closet to change clothes. I think I wasn't to wear a dress, but change my mind and put on white jeans and a blue blouse. I go out and get on the bus. Everyone else knows that the actress and her husband and a friend of theirs for me are already on the bus, but I don't. It's to be a surprise. I look for a seat, a single seat, for me, and everyone is grinning at me. So I finally find my seat at the very back of the bus. My needle-pointed cushion is on the seat. I sit and then turn and see the actress. We all laugh at the surprise. They introduce me to their friend, a small, plump, round-faced, black young man with short curly hair. I am disappointed and so is he. I think maybe he'll start feeling OK about being fat. I laugh because it's not likely and I realize maybe I could also feel OK about being fat. Then the music gets garbled and we hear the bus driver fiddling with the tape (the actress' sound tape) and says, "We'll have to cut out 'The killer Song.' He mends the tape after the Killer song and plays music again. (441 words)

My wheelchair is broken. I had driven it up to my van and gotten out. Then I saw a midget with no legs and deformed hands go in my chair with her two kids and drive it around. They broke it. I get out and try to find them. I ask a deaf woman for info on where they are. I have to repeat myself, but she understands pretty well. Then I decide I'll drive through the campground until I see them. [BL] (82 words)

Now I'm going to jail, myself and two other women. A man and a woman are our teachers. They say we have to learn history in order to understand and then be released. 1803, Osprey. 1940. There are other dates and symbols. Three different times the teachers would take a break, go to another room and make love. We could see them and hear them. I commented that's not a very good idea for prisoners to see that because we can't have any. I hope to choose a room next time where I can't see them. I am released. Ginny and I also pick me up. We walk home in the heavy snow. We slide on ice on the road (the gutter the tires made). It's fun. I say, "We got to ice skate in jail." We slide our feet like we're skating. Dovre runs fast to see me. She's excited I'm home. I see a huge turquoise crystal rock and admire it. Ginny says, "It's yours," and gives it to me. I go inside where Ernie and Rigo are waiting. It is a sweet family scene. (187 words)

A woman director is looking at the butts of the male and female actors. The woman's buns are big and heavy. The director says, "Ah! They don't make them like they used to." She admires them. Then the director gets up and goes to the door where a male worker is standing. She gives him a sexy come-on look and takes him off to have her way with him. Later, she returns. A fat Andy Divine guy comes and sits by her. He has on a small brown round derby hat. He says he's available should she be interested. She says she is. His hat wiggles up and down comically. Now I'm the actress. Josh comes up and says, "Dora's in the hospital and wants you to call her." I am surprised and concerned. I find a phone and call. A nurse answers. I hear Dora in the back ground say, "I'm expecting this call." The nurse says, "You can't talk to her." I say, "Wait. I was told to call her." The nurse is indignant that I would be so pushy and rude as to try to talk with Dora now. I feel embarrassed like it's not my fault, I'm just obeying a summons. Then I say, "Is it OK to come see her?" The nurse snorts derisively, "No, of course not." I get angry and say, "OK," then I hang up, slamming the receiver. Then I see Dora's daughter Daphne in a nurse's outfit and ask how her mom is. Daphne says she's doing better. I say, "What's wrong with he?" and Daphne says, "She's getting treatment for being a child sex molester." I am surprised and feel sad for Daphne and shocked about Dora. I'd never imagine she'd be like that! (294 words)

A young man and I are running upstairs to our new apartments which are side by side. I am now alone and I see the door to his apartment open. It's #624. I peek around the corner and happily call out to him because I know he's there and I really want to see the apartment. He says, "Come in," and I walk around the corner. I see two rooms separated by a yellow lace curtain hanging on dark beautiful wood round hoops. I see pictures on the wall and furniture in place. The place has a warm lived-in feeling. Very pretty. I think, "How did he do that so fast?" My place is a mess with boxes stacked and nothing unpacked yet. (123 words)

Joe K and I are in a small sports car. He's driving. We are soon to be lovers. We like each other. I see we are going very fast and cutting in and out of traffic like a race. He's watching me out of the corner of his eye to see if I'm scared. I mostly am enjoying the wind and the grace of the movement, but I do have some concern. I'm thinking about whether I'm in danger or not and if I am, I should stop it. I decide I'm safe. We get to this city and pull up to an apartment. We go in to have lunch. I am aware that we might decide to make love. I see the kitchen and take over immediately. I am walking well and take a bag of frozen shrimp and pineapple pieces out of the refridge. I wonder why I'm being so domestic and then think, "Oh well, he drove, so it's fair I do this." He is seated at the dining room table just waiting. I expertly lay the table - the two plates, the cups, the knives and forks, the two salads. He watches. I then sit to eat. He says, "What kind of rocks are these?" He points to a small box of rocks on the table. I sort through them and I say, "This one is igneous. These are quartz crystal. This looks like agatized material." I see a square of rocks that look like they had been started to be onyx chessmen and haven't been carved out yet. (263 words)

I enter a large room. It is my apartment that I share with my husband of four months. It is late at night. He's already in bed. He's black and I'm white. I tiptoe in and lay down on the bed beside him. He is very aware of me. We've never made love, even though we are married. He wants me but he does not approach. I look at his sweet young face and am moved, maybe pity, or caring. I curl up to him and start kissing his cheek and neck. He is happy and excited. Finally, I have cared enough to give him this sexual gift. I sit on top of him and we have orgasm. It feels very good. Then we rest. Someone knocks on the door. I get up to open the door. He says, "Wait! You must not. It's the police." Our being of different races and together is very bad and against the law. I see the heavy deadbolt locks on the door. I go hide in the bathroom. I write phone numbers and names on a piece of paper and try to hide it so he can find it, but the police can't. Then the police are in the bathroom, questioning me. (209 words)

I am at Ginny's. Mateo and I are going to sleep together on a mattress in front of the TV. It's a treat. I then remember I can't get down to the floor, with my knees. I suggest we sleep on the bed in the other room. I remind myself that it's OK because Mateo is a small boy. Then, we are in the parking lot of Safeway or Fred Meyers. I am asking the store desk for some oily stuff to go in my pickup. She doesn't have any, but she says, "I have something that might work." She goes to an open freezer thing and digs around. I say, "Candy?" She says, "No. We also keep medicines here," and gets a container (a tube) and squirts what looks like whipped cream into a paper cone. It's messy and hard to hold. I grimace and say, "Thanks a lot," sarcastically. I say to Dwight, "I guess we'll try to put in on the engine before we leave." He says he knows how and goes out. The clerk asks if I want any cat litter. She shows me a selection of different sizes of pebbles and gravel. I think about it, but feel tired and decide to wait until I get to Ginny's, even though I know it will be more work for them. I go outside and see the pickup gone and two dogs and a small toddler girl running across the street. I am appalled. The young boy had gone off on a joy ride. Ginny wasn't thinking well enough to give permission. I urgently call the girl and the dogs out of the street. I take her hand and we walk on the top of a path that's like a thick fence top. She falls off to the right side and I nearly fall off the left side. We wobble back to the parking lot. The pickup is back. I lecture Ginny (scold, a little). I see Dwight instructing the boy to put the whipping cream stuff on a roll of insulation. I say, "That won't help. It's supposed to go in the engine." What a mess. Nothing is going right. (364 words)

I'm in a car. I look in the rear view mirror and see the headdress of an Indian Chief. He's riding a motorcycle behind me. My car is borrowed from someone. It's falling apart. The fender is peeling of, the wheel is unsteady, the steering wheel ill sharpened. I'm in the passenger side steering. I ask Ginny who is in the back seat to shift to "D" for drive. She does. Then because we're all over the road, I scoot over into the driver's seat to take better control. (89 words)

I now live at Mabel's house with a young man named Jeff, who is learning counseling, and my sister Lydia or Paulina. It is a warm atmosphere where we use and learn counseling techniques. I start singing with someone. He sings, "I have the time." I repeat, "I have the time." It's a hearty blues/gospel song with background singers and clapping. It is joyous and strong. I am in excellent voice. I sit in between two people at a small round table on stage. I wear a hat that's too far down near my eyes. I keep trying to move it up so I can see and be seen better. I stand up while singing, my left arm around "Elmo's" shoulders. We sing, "To see the world," and then the best line, "Angels, hanging in the sky." I am thrilled at how well I can sing. It is beautiful. (149 words)

A young, good-looking man like Darryl is attracted to me and I am to him. He starts to kiss me gently and tenderly. I like it. Then we are in the back seat and he leans back and says, "Before we go any further, we have to talk." He says he has some concerns about being full-time around my children, especially at breakfast time. I agree. I say, "When they were little, I used to count the days when they'd be old enough to get their own breakfast. Was I a terrible mother? But now that they are grown, it's easier. But it's still hard, I know." I continued, "I know that breakfast isn't the only issue. It's the children in general." He agrees. (124 words)

I am talking to him (the same guy) on the phone. I am constantly interrupted by the antics of his 2-year-old boy who I am apparently babysitting. The boy runs and jumps from a high place. I yell, "Be careful," and get up to pick him up. He's flat and I peel him off the floor like a gooey plastic toy and then he's back to his original self. "Are you hurt?" I ask concerned. He smiles, and takes off playing again. I return to the phone, only now it's a girls voice and I ask who this is, hoping it's not his wife. It is his daughter and I think of what I'll say so I'll appear to just be a friend. Then the boy has a platter he's carrying with a wine glass, tall and slim, on it. "Be careful!" I call out. It slips off and hits the floor. I run to see if it's broken. It has a piece chipped out of it. I feel sad. The shape is changed. It's like a blue flower petal design. I go back to the phone. He's on the line. I say, "It was the glass we got at the Expo, in Seattle." (204 words)

Robin (Judith's daughter) asks me if I want a piece of pie. I say, "Yes." She brings me a huge plate filled with lots of baked fruits. I say, "I can't eat this much." My daughters are nearby, looking at photos. One brings me a picture and asks where it was taken. It was Ellie at 2 or 3 years and Dwight half-grown. I say to my mother, "Mom, where was this picture taken?" She says, "Hillsboro." I say, "How old is Dwight?" She says, "16." Then everyone has taken their photos and the only ones left are Ellie's. I give them to her. I then look around for a place to be alone, but we are having a party. There are lots of guests, only they are all ghosts. The main ghost is Blackbeard the pirate. The party is over, so they all disappear. Then a boy and a girl (teenage) see a boat. The pirate makes them fall into the ocean and swim to the boat. Their clothes are not wet. I'm now on the boat. I sit on a beam hanging over the sea for a somewhat long time. I get back on the ship and get in a hammock. It's a blue cloth and the tip covers my feet. A man scoffs at me. "How can you stand being in a hammock?" We insult each other. He's a sexist pig and we're stuck with each other. I go inside and look around at the mess and try to clean it up, only each time I pick up something and think it's a mess, it turns out to be logical or necessary, except for a basket full of lids, each one wrapped in a plastic wrap. "Hmm," I say and put it back on the stove where it had been. (303 words)

I look to an opened window. I see a cardboard. I pick it up. It's some forgotten thing that had been with the closed window for a long time. I pick it up. A black and white photo or drawing of a young woman is in the upper left l/4 of the cardboard. My mother says, "My nose." She is surprised and happy to see it. Apparently it's a drawing she started years ago to practice drawing a nose. (79 words)

My mother wants a cup of water, good distilled water. I remembered seeing some on a shelf at a store so I go to get it. I can't find it. I look and look, then I ask for it. The clerk takes me to the first row of shelves with laundry items. That's not it. Then I see it on the 2nd row of shelves. I get it and have to sit on a round cylinder that unhooks and I am precariously hanging on to it and the cup of water. I get down. Now I'm looking for a cup. I ask Kay. She points out a large pitcher. No I say. Then I see a blue cup-shaped like a flower or a plant. I take it and sit it on a table next to some people I know. Then I go outside to sight-see for a few minutes even though its nearly midnight and the clerk is tired and wants to go home. I think I'm in India. A man with dark, long hair (hippie length) walks by and stops and looks at me. He smiles and says, "Oh, I thought you were someone I knew." I said, "Oh, I thought you were Merle," he goes on. I see very ornate carvings all over the building's walls. (218 words)

I am concerned because I forgot to take my pills and I need to do it now. I go into a lobby of a restroom. Someone is helping a woman take a shower. I am uptight. As I pull out my pill bottle, I notice with concern I don't have very many left. Aunt Bridget comes in as I'm dumping them out on the counter to count them. She says, "I saw your poster. It's good but..." and I said impatiently, "No negative comments. I can't take them right now." She turned and left, embarrassed saying, "Thank you for hearing that in my voice. Of course you don't want negative stuff now." I feel a little guilty but OK. I see pills of different sizes and shapes and I'm trying to figure out which ones to take. I ask Bridget's advice on one very ornate, flat pill as to whether it says 2 or 3 milligrams. Another pill turns out to be the manufacturer's label and another one an applique. I then find big fat ones, some green and some yellow. The 20 milligram size (like Percadans), I try to get one out and it's like taffy. I scoop it up on my finger and eat it off my finger. I think I've taken 25 milligrams. I had chocked on a "5" pill and it had dissolved in my throat like an aspirin with some of the sticky residue left on my finger. Bridget says, "I know about air dynamics" and pulls it off and throws it like a paper airplane across the room. I feel nervous because I don't know if I've had enough medicine. So I follow it into the next room. Hank and other counselors are there. Hank says, "I see we're in the same room, but I don't know if we're doing the same thing." He continued, "It's like taking time out at a Christian and the Lion to let the Christians pick up the wounded." I laugh, falsely and say, "Yeah. Like you are in there, tsk tsk, sign up for classes," and I'm there. "Are you feeling OK?" I was surprised he brought it up. He has his hand on my knee warmly supportive. Then Ellie (3 years old) crawls up on his lap. He is pleasantly surprised. "I didn't think I'd still be considered for such an honor." I see the smaller baby and pick her up. She turns into a magazine without a pretty picture on the cover. It's like I'm competing with Hank and I'm last. (425 words)

I am with Howard. We've been married a long time but we don't have sex. He's very frustrated. I feel sorry for him, but I just don't want to with him. I get up, thinking it's morning, but it's 5:20 a.m. and still dark outside. I am organizing some old papers and books. He gets up and goes sadly into another bedroom. (62 words)

A group of people are out in a field. They are sheep and have collectively decided to band together to attack the wolf. I see one woman in the center whose two strands of hair droop down over her face like two antennae of a bee. She steps forward and leads the group. As a group they approach the wolf. Then I see a bear and then a panther. Then the group goes back toward the house. Now I'm in the house with my new/young husband. I am feeling caring. He has a rash on his arm, maybe poison oak from out in the field. I hesitate to touch him because I don't want the rash, but I've already touched him, so what the heck. I see a bandage with Doctor's name on it like it's the prescription. He goes back to bed. I stay up and start organizing papers and books, old ones left for a time in a sack, letters from my daughters, old appointment book (red). I get hungry and go to see what's in the cupboards: potato chips and oatmeal. I decide on oatmeal and remember a bowl already made in a cupboard in the bedroom my husband (Howard) went to. I pass a stove with boiling water. I ask if it's fresh. A woman carrying a tiny baby says, "Sort of. It's for checking out some kind of animal organism or bacteria." It looked like it had soap in it. I decide at the last second not to eat this old and icky dish of oatmeal. Paulina wants to babysit the baby. I look at it. It is very tiny and newborn. I ask how old it is and receive the impression that she'd just had it a few moments before. I don't think Paulina should handle such a small and fragile baby. (308 words)

I visit Shannon. She is with her boyfriend who is Bob (her ex-husband), only I comment that he was my ex-boyfriend's (Darryl's) best friend Darryl. We are packing up stuff. They are here to help me. I think, "How nice of them to pay for the gas to get here and back," and I feel a little guilty about choosing not to chip in to help pay for their expenses. I think, "It's OK. They are my friends. Let them do it." I start to pack my muffin tins and notice that her very ornate crystal rock is in the plastic bag with it. It's a huge rock with pocket holes in it where beautiful agates and crystals fit in. I think she got it from my father. I think, "Oh, oh. I better give her back her crystal." (139 words)

Now I'm in a race. I line up with the little kids, age 2 on up. Then there are some women and three men. I think, "We won't count the kids as part of the competition. Just let them run for fun." I'll probably win or be close in the women's division and the guys will win the race. I feel determined. The race starts and I am out in the lead. The guys are very close behind me. I put out heroic efforts, panting, running; it's hard to do. I pull myself step by step. The curb or railing is pink and I pull on it to get me up the hill. The guys get ahead of me. I'm sweating and exhausted. I come into a room. They are seated, drinking ice water and taking a breather. I just keep on going. I hope they don't notice I'm gone until I've gotten a good lead! I struggle and struggle. Then they notice and race. I just barely cross the finish line ahead of them. The winner. I collapse from the strain and lie there panting, catching my breath. (189 words)

I am an Indian woman out in the woods. White horse soldiers are coming -- so I go into a square rock "cave" and roll a rock over the entrance. There are little peepholes where I can look out and see what's happening. They are looking for me and ride up close. My horse is with me in there and I have trained it to be quiet when I lay the reins a certain way. I hope he doesn't give me away. I look out and see a soldier very close to the rock and hope they don't find me. I'm there for days -- it's like being buried alive. I wonder how the horse is going to go to the bathroom. Finally, it is safe to get out. I disguise myself. Now I am sort of Cary Grant and traveling down a road, maybe the Alaskan Highway, and I'm looking for that Indian girl. I see two women in "India" Indian-like garb riding in a horse-drawn carriage. I'm in some other coach or something. I hop over into their carriage, and say, "You are very pretty Indian girls." They are shocked and disapproving. "Oh," says Cary, "I guess you hear that a lot." They stop the carriage and insist he leave. He's now wearing one of their outfits and sneaks behind the carriage, hoping no one's on the road to see him. He starts walking down the road when we all notice a huge line of cars and people suddenly coming. We laugh because he's going to be very embarrassed. Now there are three of us: Cary and I and one of the Indian women. She asks me what I've been doing. I say, "Researching that Indian woman incident." I'll stay around for a few more days and do more research, ask questions, and then I'll relax and go fishing or boating. I am now standing at the edge of a shallow, high mountain lake. Water is warm. There are lots of mosquitoes and water bugs skittering around on the surface (like Hebo lake in Tilly) of the dark, dank, gray-green water. Cary Grant is already out to the deep part and calls back to the Indian woman teasingly, "You're OK here, but I wouldn't trust your help in New York (meaning the deeper water). I'm not sure I'd hire you." She smiles and says, "You miss the point." He says, "What is it?" I say, like to a mentally retarded person, "She means she's suggesting friendship and all you see is hiring her." The hair on his head bursts into flames. "Oh," he says, "I'm embarrassed," and slowly submerges to put out the flames. She and I laugh. We wade out. I see a herd of moose with huge antlers far across the lake. They are beautiful. I remember I must feed the cats. So I have a white envelope in which I put cat food and hamburger and powdered milk. I pour water in. I repeat this several times so the cat will have enough, then I lay it on the shore of the lake. Time to relax and swim in the warm water, with my friends. (530 words)

I am seated on a stairway thing like you can roll out to an airplane. Suddenly it starts to move. It rolls into a room and it starts dancing with the projected image of Alister Cooke. After the dance I smile and point to his retreating figure and say, "I know I danced with you." I go into another room. I'm standing now. A fat girl is looking over at a fat boy. They are making eyes at each other shyly. So I open some object to attract the guy over for her so he'll have an excuse to come talk to her. He comes over and they walk off together. Some man calls to me and wants some glue. I see a bottle and throw it over to him. It's old and sticks badly as it lands on a wall near him. He is angry and asks for fresher glue. I throw another one. It's not good either. He's very angry and comes at me. I must kick his balls and hit his face to protect myself. (178 words)

A woman has been running from her mean husband. She is blindly feeling the walls as she goes down the street. She comes to a telephone booth. I join her and offer to help. We look up names of people/agencies that can help her. I decide we'd choose a time in the afternoon and go back to her apartment and get her personal things when her husband isn't around. Then my male friend and I can help her decorate her new apartment with her own possessions. I am in her apartment. The husband (like Cary Grant) harasses me.

I'm looking at a huge hand-written and colored book. I see a movie image of a small cute fox and a cute pig as they are playing and crawling on some metal stand. Then they jump into water and swim, and I observe how in movies what looks like a difficult feat is really two easy things done separately and cut to look like one. Then in the book I am reading is a list of the training it took for the little animal (dog) to be trained. My Uncle Willis trains the animal from birth. So the list goes. Sanitary 3 1/2 weeks A. (phone #) 2" = (only went to bathroom on floor twice). There was lots more and it was calligraphied and the huge capital letters were hand-painted. I ask my father if Uncle Willis made this book! I am impressed. My father says yes. I turn the page and see cartoons and I laugh. The first square is a car going over a cliff and lots of men grabbing at Uncle Willis, and a cow caught up innocently goes over too. The next square is a closeup of Willis in the car. Men are behind (one political party) grabbing for him and in front coming through the windshield, hands pushing him back (the other political party.) I say to my father, "He must have been running for some political office locally." A small boy (3 or 4 years old) comes and stands by me and says, "I wonder where I could buy some books for 15 cents." My mother who had been sleepily sitting in a chair nearby, tiredly opens her eyes and says disapprovingly and cranky, "I wonder what you mean by that!" (She thinks he's hinting for her to get him some books.) I put my arm around him and pull him close so he can share my book and pat him on his tummy reassuringly. My Aunt Rosalie is watching. My father says, "Do you think it's safe to use the computer now?" I say, "I think so." I pull up to a card table near where he's working so I can companionably read and chat with him as he turns on the computer. (371 words)

I am seated near Howard/Arthur who hands me a valentine and asks if I had received one like this, would I respond favorably? It's wordy and long with 2 or 3 pages. The first page has hearts and the word "husband" in a square that moves (so different words can show in the "window") I say, "Yes," but I'm just being polite and I think, "I've already married you once." We are both pretending the valentine isn't for me and I am actually confused if it is or not, so I pretend nonchalantly, then I gather up some belongings I'd been collecting. I look in a paper sack and see sugar-free bubble gum, sugar-free M & M's and chocolate chips. There is a small, golden miniature trunk that has drawers that open up. I spill candies and am scooping them up with my hands. It's been a long time since I'd had sweets and don't want to leave any of them behind. (162 words)

I am shooting at a man who stole millions of dollars. I fire bullet after bullet. Several hit him in the leg or back. He flinches, but keeps running. Howard (sheriff) stands to my left. I reload the gun and throw away some spent shells. The bad guy locks himself in a vault-like place with a small window of thick glass. I load a huge empty "dum dum" shell and fire it at the glass. It's like a bazooka or flame thrower fire starts. I see his eye huge, scared and prominent peering out at the fire. I know I've got him now. I wonder how "they" made his eye so prominent. Probably colored it a special color to draw attention to it. The fire spreads and he runs out. I yell, "Get the money." I start to go in, but the flames are too much. So I order four women to go in (deputies) They do, and throw out boxes with stacks and stacks of bills. (167 words)

I'm traveling with a group. I think we're in Alaska, looking at the wilderness, walking a track. People watch me to see if I can handle it. Stairs are steep. People are sitting on the stairs and I have to walk over them carefully. Now we are at a meeting and a friend gets voted in to a special office of importance. I get voted in to a new office. They've been waiting for someone with the proper skills to show up. A writer. I get to be historian, or scrap book person. I'm not too thrilled. Then Rita and I walk to the beach down a steep path. I look out across the ocean and I see huge waves and a heavy, threatening sky. A bad storm is coming. We are concerned about some of our group who are out on boats. Will they get back safely? I pick up some of Rita's vials and eye drop things (German Rita who is visually impaired). I don't get them all. I go back to the huge dorm-like house. The group meets. Ellie and Paulina are in swimsuits and want to go down to a little swim. I say, "No. It's too dangerous." They are hard to convince, but they return with us. The male leader says, "It's confirmed. It's SAM (the name of the hurricane.) They're even breaking out the canoes in New England. It's a big one. So get inside. Be prepared. We'll survive it. I ask if we have enough food to last. There is. [BL] (257 words)

I am at a conference. I look for an elevator. I see a ridiculously small dumb waiter door. I wonder if I'll fit! I go in and see a toilet, a desk, several chairs. It's an office for the operator and quite roomy. So I go in and we travel down and then out on the street to the next location. Now Rochelle and I are going into a room. There are lesbians in there and Rochelle takes my hand. She is wearing white gloves. My hand lays inept in hers. I don't want to hold her hand because I don't want the lesbians to think I am one. I feel uncomfortable, but I don't pull my hand away because I don't want to hurt Rochelle's feelings. In another room, I hear a man talking and he mentions M City High. He's a coach. I say, "When were you there?" I also graduated from M City High. He smiles and says, "1939 or 1932." I go into another room where people are talking about women's issues and a man is grimacing cause he's tired of hearing about it all the time. (191 words)

I'm sitting on the sidewalk near the gutter and say to myself, "Wow. I'm in the gutter, literally." I feel unbalanced, like the sidewalk leans uphill. Then I look up in the sky and see a huge, square aircraft and three planes hovering near it. It's a fueling craft. I am amazed at how low they are! The noise is very loud. A man wonders if he should protect himself by putting his arms over his head and ducking. I go inside. A man is going to teach me something. He says he'll be the drummer and I'll improve a role. I go to a table and pick up a pair of banjos and start playing a rhythm. He has a single round drum with some feather design on the skin. He puts his drum away as I am now the drummer. I play intricate sounds and dance around. Then I stop and describe the planes I saw to my parents who seem interested but look bored. I tell what the man said and how close they were. "I could even read the writing on it, it was so low," I say. (192 words)

I am on a bus. Three of us women are in charge of this baby. One woman breast feeds the baby. Two little boys get off the bus and into the elevator I'm in. One boy says to the other, as he's coming in the elevator, "Did you see those breasts!" The door shuts so that he and I are the only two in the elevator. He is red-faced with embarrassment. I want to ease his feelings, so I pretend to be deaf and ask him to tell me the floors as we go up so he'll know I'm "deaf." Now I get on the bus again. The other two women go up near the front. I go up there and say, "I knew it. No seats available up here. Just thought I'd try." I go back down the aisle a few rows and sit in a seat next to the baby. She says, "Agua," and I say, "I'm sorry. She (the other woman) forgot to bring the water." I felt sorry for her and picked her up and held her close, rocking her. She is very sweet. I am upset with the woman who forgot the water. She's up front having fun and being carefree while this baby goes without. The baby is very patient. (216 words)

I am a chaperone to a group of high school kids. We get up early. I feel tired. We go to the bus and look for a restaurant to have breakfast. We get one, but there isn't room for all of us, so four of us go on down the street to find another restaurant. I think we are in France. We can't find one that doesn't breakfast. We find one that has English words on the menu: Cheese, Fish. Beef. Ellie wants to eat there. I am disappointed. I wanted a breakfast. I am in my van. Bonnie is driving. I'm in my wheelchair in the back. We stop at a gas station. I open an envelope with lots of cash in it, ready to pay for the gas. A man opens the back door and starts talking to me. He looks at the money. At first I think he's the gas station attendant. Then I realize he's a crazy man and I feel concerned. He gets out and goes in his own sports car. We start to drive out. I'm still holding the $10 bill. I say, "We didn't pay, did we?" Bonnie says, "No," so she drives back and we drive through a number of times looking for someone to take the money. Finally we give up, feeling we'd done all we could and left. Now we are at my parents'. I have a baby with me I'd promised to watch after. I feel concerned because I'd handed her over to two different parties and maybe should be more responsible. I have a pile of clothing that belongs to the baby and my mother starts to put it away. I say, "No, wait. I want it out here. I'll use it several times a day." She is annoyed but leaves it out. (305 words)

My mother tells me that Aunt Muriel died. I am surprised because I had just written to her because I'd dreamed about her last week. I started looking for the dream book to show my mother what I'd written. I can't find it. I pick up a child's schoolbook and read it until I realize it's not the dream book. I had been packing to go visit my mother and I find the dream book. I open it to a dream where a beautifully drawn picture is on the page and the dream was written over it. I am very impressed. I had no idea I was capable of such excellent drawing skills. It is a vague cousin V, her husband and their baby. [BL] (124 words)

I'm on some kind of tour bus, going from one place to another to accomplish tasks. One stop is the hand surgeon to look at my hands. I see a mechanical mama going up stairs. A small mechanical baby rides in her wagon (her back) a "toddler" sized wheel is attached on the back and it's going faster than the mama and has to slow down or get cramped up uncomfortably. They bounce uncomfortably up the stairs. Now I'm on a bus. We stop. I say, "Is this place accessible." I see a ramp. The bus driver thinks there are a few steps. I remember I'd been there before and decide not to go now. Josh is near the back of the bus and decides we'll all skip this stop, but four or five women get off anyway and we drive away. Josh is concerned that we will forget them and leave them. So I memorize the address, 4th and main. We go to the next stop. (167 words)

I am in Grandma Agnes' living room. I see a picture of Clyde on the piano, only it's not him. It's an antique picture of a full-bearded man (maybe guy Arthur). His eyes are startling: shiny, silvery and intense. It's spirit world stuff. I look around the room. A light suffuses the room. It is light from the spirit world. I feel a little scared. I hear scary music and feel tension. Nothing happens. Just the light is there. [After I wake up, I decide to meditate on that light, and saw the following images: l. A cobblestone street (rainy like London, very old that goes down and beyond. It sorts of disappears into the light. The feeling of a tunnel. I see then a cloaked figure (at first I think it is death. Maybe it is. Then it seems to be a woman. She goes into the light. 2. I see a door at a corner of a wall. It is only the open door hole, no actual door to open or close. Blackness is beyond. 3. A jail cell door swings open, I swing on it like a garden gate. 4. A face, headband, narrow, small eyes, high up forehead, bulbous nose, small mouth, bad teeth. I wonder if this is my guide. There is "Indianness" about it. I am disappointed at its ugliness, then I try to think of it as "rough hewn."] (79 words)

I am in a room. Bonnie comes in to introduce her new fiance. He is short, balding, has a moustache and is white. He has several sons. One is a midget and retarded, full-grown man. I call him "son" like he's a child. Bonnie takes care of him like Cher in "Moonstruck." I am surprised she chose him. I feel sad, realizing I'm the only one left unmarried. I ask if he smokes. She says no. I then say, "OK, I won't smoke in your house. I will respect that." (90 words)

I'm at a park, some community hippie function, lots of long tables. On one table are piles of clothes for sale, used clothes. I look each pile over. A man stands near me and also looks. I find an emerald green tee-shirt (turtleneck) that's too small. I think, "I don't like green, but this shirt is beautiful" (like Ginny said years ago). Then I look to the next table. Picnic stuff. I think, "This could get boring," but I see a band, so I know there will be entertainment. Everyone else is already seated with their food. I go to the end of a table and say, "Is this where you start?" A man says, "I guess so." I ask where the plates are. "Over several tables." So I go over and get two paper plates. I find a tiny teaspoon and dish up macaroni and cheese from a big pot. Then I go back to the food table to get a hot dog. As I'm walking toward it, a fat hippie guy says, "I have to go to the bathroom. I hope I can make it." The crowd answers sympathetically. He starts to walk, then his face grimaces up as he has a bowel movement in his pants right there in front of everyone. "Oh," he cries, "I couldn't help it, and it's a hiney." He turns around so we can see his butt. Two pounds of butter is in a plastic sack and stapled to his shorts. Some guy jokes about it, "At least it wasn't chili," to ease his embarrassment. Raul jokes, "Is there any money on it?" (betting he could do better). I walk to the table and see a warmer with one hot dog left. I try to lift the lid. A guy offers to help. It's a huge bun with a dozen tiny hot dogs laid sideways across it. It weighs a lot and my paper plate has trouble not crumpling up. (328 words)

A little mouse with tiny ears is in a box. I feel guilty because I had left it in there for a long time without food or water. Someone takes it out and puts it with other mice in a box with food and water. Its ears become huge like bat wings with a red rose painted on each one. It slips out of the person's hand and falls, but it is flexible and quick and is ok. [BL] (78 words)

I'm a stunt car driver. I'm good. I hang on as the car roars around and seconds before it crashes and burns, I jump. I am surrounded by the dense black smoke of the fire and walk out of the cloud coughing and grasping for air. Someone clamps an oxygen mask on me and we walk up the stairs. I regain my strength. We go into the boss's office and I'm very aggressive and uppity. I know I'm good and he'd better pay me well or I'll walk out. (89 words)

I am crawling up, hand over hand, a long pole. It's the entrance to the penthouse. I am very afraid. Maybe my hands won't hold on and I'll fall. I'm afraid of heights. Some man is with me, right behind me. We make it up to the top. His father is there. He's rich and uncaring. Now I'm on a boat in raging waters. Other women are on the boat, including a huge, 500 pound fat woman. The water is moving so fast, it's almost solid like taffy. I stand in one of the waves and push and work it with my hands to keep from drowning. Then suddenly the water dries up and I look forward and see a dried-up small creek bed with two old crazed men sitting on the bank. I feel terror. (136 words)

I'm walking down a road. I carry a small purse with pens in it. We are going to a party. The road goes through a house with rooms on each side. I am going downhill. It's like a hall. On the left a woman is bedridden. On the right are kitchen drawers. A small bird or two fly in. The woman in bed says, "They like to perch on the drawer knobs sometimes." I find the door to the party and open it up. A very steep stairway goes nearly straight down. I close the door, annoyed. I can't go. Then a woman says, "There's another way around the back." While she's clearing out stuff, I go find a bathroom. There are beds stored in there and the toilet is an adult-sized potty chair which has urine in it. I pee and it overflows. I stand up and now have a barrel stuck to my butt. It is dripping excess urine. I walk out into the hall, now wearing a robe to hide this mess. I hope no one notices. (180 words)

A group of men are seated at a table near the door. It is difficult to squeeze through. They tease us and then make room. We go out and I remember I had a bicycle. We look everywhere and can't find it. I realize it's been stolen. My friend (Shannon or Jennifer) says I should have chained it! Next time I'll remember to lock it! I feel a little guilt. (114 words)

I am a woman lawyer apprentice that does all the work for the male seniors and gets used and ignored. I have decided to confront them and I pound on their rich wooden door. Just then two good old boys come in and say, "You'll have to wait. We have important business." I am determined. They just smile. The lawyer comes out and ignores me. I try to say my piece, but he is arrogant and won't listen. I slam down my files and stalk out. As I go down the stairs, I see a blind man (Bonnie) who really can see, but is faking it. His girlfriend is patient and helping and is trying to guide him to the bus we're going to. He and I get on the bus. I sit on a side seat that faces into the aisle. He goes further in and sits facing the front. He sits next to the lawyer guy. He says, "Ah! I know who you are." The lawyer smirks. Then John (the big bodyguard) sits on the other side of him and says, "You'd better not mess with him." They exchange words and suddenly John snaps the blind man's finger and it breaks. I clearly hear the snap and see the agony of pain on his face. I feel sick for his pain. I want to help, so I suddenly say to the crowd in the bus, "Did you all hear that?" Many raise their hands. I say, "Are you willing to testify?" They say, "Yes!" I am delighted and feel good because I've got them now. I say, "Good. Memorize what they said for court." I look to the lawyer and I say, "And you're caught too! They heard every word you said." He crosses his legs and squirms because he knows I'm right. I get up and the blind man gets up to get off the bus. He gets near me and keeps peeking. I warn him to keep his eyes closed or he'll get found out. His girlfriend leans over and says, "You were pretty good at that," and we realize she'd known he was faking it all along. We get off the bus and separate. I walk back up those beautiful wood stairs and I'm the lawyer's apprentice again, walking toward the lawyer's door with my file. A male apprentice says, "What do I call you?" I answer "__________(Dexter?). Just like everyone else does." He asks me something and I answer something like, "So I can finally get married." I walk to knock on the door and the beginning scene is played out again where the two good ol' boys enter again and I am ignored. (450 words)

I'm in a mobile office waiting for my team to come in. They do. They are great big, tough soccer players. Noisy. One is complaining because he hates the Strong Campbell Interest inventory and wants to sue somebody so he doesn't have to do it. Then another guy falls out of a bunk bed and bangs his head and drags out a box full of stuff. The first guy grabs something from the box and says, "Hey! That's mine," and they start arguing and pushing. I stand up and yell at them to stop. He stands up very tall over me and snarls, "Oh yeah?" I gather up all my strength and yell, "You'd better sit down and right now!" He just melts like a scared pup into the chair. I walk away feeling some pride at winning. I explain that he'll sue whomever he wants and he'll still take the test if everyone else has to. I go outside and see I'm on a boat and some papers are sliding off into the water form the movement of the boat and the wind. I feel some concern. (188 words)

I'm at a Japanese restaurant. I have a wallet full of cash. A man and a woman in the next booth steal my wallet. I see them put it in her purse. I yell, "Hey look, somebody. They stole my money." I could see it and pointed to it, but no one would believe me. Then they stare at me. The hit man held a gun to my head and said, "I could just kill you right now." I smiled and leaned back and said, "Please do." I waited, but he chose not to. I felt disappointed. They took me to a playing court (like tennis courts.) The woman had stolen me because I have great artistic ideas and she wants to paint them. She's standing at an easel trying to paint. I sit down. She says, "I could just make you love me. But I won't." "Good," I said, putting my feet up (I'm Walter Brennen), "because it would never work!" We are in a small courtyard off the main one with sliding glass and wooden doors like in Japanese homes. (182 words)

I go into Susie S's house. It's in a run-down neighborhood, but it once was the best neighborhood, so the architecture and tile work are still beautiful, though dusty. She's going to have a baby. We see the nursery. The living room walls are white tile with brown tile square frames. In the nursery, I see a pile of old clothes of mine I'd forgotten to move into my house. I start to go through them, finding pieces I remembered I liked. Ellie is here. Then I find a pile of little kittens and dogs that had been there for a long time. I feel badly because they've been forgotten and hadn't had food or water for too long. One little kitten's paws are deformed and they are weakened. I gather them up and take them outside. I suggest to Ellie she take the littlest kitten. She'd rather take one not so bad off, one of the white ones. I get annoyed and insist she take the littlest one. Outside, my mother pours water into a bowl and I put the kitties near it so they can drink. One puppy lies on my lap, a golden cocker spaniel type. I pet it and say, "This one likes that. She could stay forever like this. I've got a friend for life." Then the puppy is a child with a British accent. I ask how long she's been abandoned by her parents. "Eleven days," she says. I ask her if she wants to get back with them. She says, "Oh, yes." I say, OK, we'll work on that." (266 words)

I am packing. I have to leave at 3:30 to get on the bus by 4:00. One of my students declares his love for me. His name is Harry Palmer and he has a crazy mother. He's a little plump and flabby, but a nice guy. I feel warmth for him, but tell him no. I appreciate his feelings but I don't return the feelings. He is pathetically sad. I am telling my students, two males and one young woman, about my travels. The other man is seated on the floor very close to the woman. She whines that it's her space. I agree with her and ask the guy to move. He goes to another spot, crawling under a bookshelf. He finds a filmstrip and I hold it up to the light. I say it's very interesting. Old time pictures. He wants us to get a projector and look at them. I say, "If we have time," and then I see it is 2:45! "Oh! No time," I say and rush off to pack. I start to pull books and papers out of a drawer and say, "It's not like I'm going to France." I'm just leaving the community college for a while. I can return to get things later. I see that Harry has forgotten my toothbrush and shrug my shoulders. Oh well. I can get another. (229 words)

Ginny, another woman and myself have on long white dresses. We see a marimba band. "Oh good," says Ginny and starts dancing. I start to dance too. We don't care that it is three women in a circle, no guy. But I am a little self-conscious about it. I look out the window and see a wedding going on. The groom comes over to talk with me. As we talk, he sits on an office chair on wheels and I sit on his lap. He hugs me close and we wheel around as we chat. It feels very companionable. I am telling him how people come up to me and say, "So what's wrong with you?" and "What's your condition?" and "Do you have a family?" I use a whiney singsong voice to answer them. Then I hug him and say, "But like for you, a friend, it's OK, I want to share, but not to strangers." Then he says, "Poor Harry Palmer." I say, "I knew him. Yeah, that's sad." I enjoy being with this guy as we wheel around talking. (182 words)

I am in my wheelchair and go down this hall/porch. I see two girls (college age) seated at several wheelchair-height desks trying to decide whether to buy them or not. I pull up and say, "They won't be helpful for school. Too cumbersome to carry and fold and besides, they have tables there, but for home they're OK." They thank me and I go on in the house. The kitchen is a mess: dishes in sink, paper sacks on floor. I start to clean out the leather tool pouch on my waist. A huge screwdriver handle I think, "Wow that's big! And then it's a bottle of smooth liquid "power supply" oil. I keep that. Then I open a bottle of assorted pills and pour them out - some big white calcium tablets, some tiny white ones (cortisone) and some bird shaped ones, like in jewelry (broken). Someone knocks on the door. I answer. A man asks, "Is this where they want info on funerals?" I say, "Oh. That was last week. We already had the funeral." He looks incredulous, so I explain. I didn't want the funeral parlor stuff, but I wanted the body to be properly fixed (embalmed). He finally shrugs and leaves. I say to Ellie, "Go get the cat with the ribbon and sign on it and take them off her. We don't need to advertise anymore." I continue to cleanup. I pull out a bottle of whiskey and tell Ellie to put it on top of the fridge or wherever booze (spirits) is kept. (259 words)

My father and I are in a rowboat and the motor won't start. I see a big boat going by. My father is of the opinion we'll work it out and don't need the other boat. I feel we'd better get help while it's here or we'd get stranded. I call over. We hook up to them and they drag us to shore. On shore, I discover three tiny, funny creatures that are "new," no others like them in the world. I've "discovered" something special. One is white, one is black and one is crusty colored. I call them B's Buddies. My thought comes to me that if I find something small and cheap to reproduce and sell them, I could make a lot of money! Now I come to my house and I go in and walk from room to room, naming the rooms. On several occasions, I was not satisfied with the size or type of room as it appeared in my dream and I changed it to what I liked better. A living room, a dining room, a sitting room, a bedroom, a kitchen, the children's room, a play room. Now there are two kids, a boy and a girl. They are being noisy and naughty. I push them into their room and slam the door. They are talking about sneaking out. I listen in at the door. As they try to sneak out, I grab them and throw them back in. I slap them several times. The children are very angry at me. I am angry at them. (262 words)

I'm on some journey. Then Maggie has a prescription for an orgasm. I experience an orgasm while I'm seated on a couch. There are other people in the room, so I drop my head down like I'm contemplating and look at the floor, concentrating on not moving or making any noises so no one will know I'm doing this in public. Afterwards I hope they don't see my flushed face. The nurse tells Maggie she came to the wrong place. I intervene and tell the nurse it's really a Birth Control Medication, so she tells Maggie to go to Student Health in the basement. (104 words)

Now I'm a doctor and I come at my shift. The other doctor says, "We've got that cranky patient. He wants an operation. He wants to remove some of his intestines to make room for some extra organs, like maybe a kidney." I say, "Which organ does he want?" The other doctor says, "Oh, he's not sure yet." I say, "What does he think, this is a multiple-choice organs?" Now the surgery is being done to me for him. The nurse says, "Good. You are dilated," meaning my blood vessels in my stomach area. I feel it. Later, after the surgery, I walk slowly into recovery room. I take the soft, cushioned chair of the other doctor who also is recovering. He protests, so I move. Someone wheels him near me, teasing. I say, "Don't you know we can't stand each other? Take him away." Bill Cosby as a doctor is in there somewhere. (154 words)

Now I am to be tested. I am told I must cross this deep canyon on a tightrope. If I fall, I'm dead. I accept the challenge. I tell myself I must concentrate one step at a time. I wonder if I can do it. I stand out and then slip and fall. I grab for the rope and catch it and hang by my hands. I go the rest of the way hand over hand, swinging my body for momentum. The rhythm was important. I get to the other side and crawl up onto the land. It is hard and I strain to get a good grip. Finally I am safely over to the other side. Then I see flames. My next test is to permit the flames to cover me, engulf me and see if I can stand the heat. I let that happen and can handle it. I am standing alone on this barren, rocky cliff and then I see a huge, ugly guy. I ask him who he is. He grabs me and holds me to him. I feel like a prisoner, trapped. I decide to try and trick him. I say, "I'll bet I can go the tight rope walk again, want to see?" I figured he can't follow me there, it's so dangerous. I go to the edge to prepare. There is water filled in the canyon. I think about swimming. He changes into a smaller, more handsome man. I say, "Who are you?" He says he's the same guy, but he changes every once in a while so he won't get lonely. I sense an Indian man standing off in the distance. Now I am told to come to the meeting, a reprieve from the tightrope. I say, "What meeting?" They are going to study my case. It's like a group therapy meeting and I'm the patient. Then it drifts into a teacher/counselor staff meeting. Michael R and Roy S are in another office talking about how soundproof the windows are. Then a teacher brings in some cards for the staff to critique. I glance at some and nod. I've seen them before. One has a picture of a family. I see a girl in a pink dress. "Co-dependency stuff," I realize. (379 words)

Howard and I are at a graduation. We are seated in the audience several rows from the front. I look up the aisle and see the aqua green-gowned graduates walking down the aisle. I shake hands with one and talk with another. He introduces his wife. She sits in front of me. He says, "I'm finally graduating." I say, "I graduated several years ago." Then I notice our seats are changing into a bus and the wife is a bus driver and I say, "Wait. We had good seats. I don't want to go." She ignores me. I feel kidnapped. I feel annoyed. I look out the window and see huge hologram-like pictures or maybe the figures are giant balloons. One figure is a gorilla with a woman dressed like in the circus sliding out of his mouth. Another figure was a woman/bee hanging in the sky (shades of Macy's Parade). A third group are like Amazon women fighting something. I comment, "Tough neighborhood we're in." It's an understatement. I see the freeway stretch out before me. Howard and I are talking and it develops into an argument. He says, "Why do you get upset and hysterical over little things like 'the wood in the morning?'" I say, frustrated, "Because you don't listen to me." He interrupts and I put my fingers on his lips and say, "Shut up and listen to me." I sound hysterical like he'd described. Howard looks like he's laughing at me. (246 words)

Bon Jori, a rock group, is playing on stage. I'm in the wings and want to rehearse with them. They do some contact improv and won't let me enter. So I go out to the audience. I'm angry and think, "OK! You just wait and see. You'll regret that." I talked to the women and then one by one and told them how they wouldn't let me join them. We all agreed to get up and walk out during their performance. We do. I step out the door and open it back up to let other women through. I hear them stop playing, in confusion calling out, "Hey lady, where are you going? What's going on?" Some men in the audience wanted me to tell them what's going on, but I chose to only talk to the women. I feel revenge. I see the audience only half full and smile. (150 words)

The house is a mess. If my mother, Lydia and I work together, we could get it all cleaned up. Then I go outside along the road and pick up papers. I throw away toilet paper and gunk. I keep some small bottles and things I think are pretty. I'm going to school. I have my schedule of classes and I look to see what my next class is. It's Hollywood at ll:30. Then it changes to Spectra or something sciency. Now an old man in a car picks me up. He drives us into a building. He has a key that unlocks the door and the elevator. He tells me to pull the key out of the box for him. I think we're in a big Cadillac. (128 words)

I am running in fear. Something is after me. I run across the hall to Theresa's door. I call out, "Theresa, Help me." I am temporarily covered by the protective wings of a huge bird. I enter the house and call for Theresa. Her family comes downstairs and asks coldly, "What do you want?" They block me from Theresa. I must run. I go across the hall. It is in hot pursuit. I make a phone call. It doesn't help. I see it. It is Burt Lancaster. He has a huge rifle. I shoot at him at the same time he fires at me. He won't die. I feel fear. (110 words)

I am to go for a short journey to visit a woman near or past Dover or Vancouver. I ask if it is near the French border, near Paris. I sort through lots of stuff. Hank asks me what I'm going to do as he is ready to leave. I say, "I'll go to work for a few days and then I'll go visit her." He goes out to the car. I then decide to catch a ride with them. I look in the window. Every space is taken. Some older woman has put her plastic packages of clothes and stuff in the car; they hang from the back of the front seat. Four people sit in the back. Mateo is one of them, the closest by me. I say, "I'll sit here with the baby on my lap." I go in through the window, feet first. It's a tight fit. I ask Hank to unroll the window more. He does so grudgingly. The driver says, "Where to?" I say, "To the woman's house, but could we stop first and get my van and then I'll follow you up there? That way I'll have my own wheels for coming back." We agree. So we stop. I get out and go up on a fire escape balcony to get my stuff, bags of clothes. Some woman asks, "Should we wash all of them?" I say, "No. Just the ones she'll use." Then I sit, with a baby on my lap. I pick up baby clothes and pile them up. I see pillows and pick them up (square and flat). Each one has been embroidered by my Aunt Millie. I choose one with "Rats" on it to use to sit on for my "bums." The rest I toss one at a time behind my shoulders. Aunt Millie is standing there.

Dolores M is trying on some clothes at a store. I see that the hooks to hang the clothes are way up high too high to reach. They follow the slope of the stairs. I say, "That's silly. Why did they do it that way?" Dolores has very heavy makeup on her face. She's here to interpret for the deaf. As I am standing, talking to her, two or three men of color, one black, one or two Native Americans, crowd around me very close. The black man is softly kissing my neck from behind. The Native American man is to my right, talking softly. Another stands some distance from us, but he and I are talking with our eyes and occasionally words. Now I'm seated in the front row. A show of some kind (fashion perhaps) will soon begin. I see a baby and ask to hold it. His blankets are all wrinkled up, so I lay him down on the floor to straighten the blanket up. I end up with the baby in a metal box that cramps the baby's legs up. I hold the baby to my chest and am concerned if it can breathe because the metal lid has closed. I open it some and say, "Boy, this baby sure doesn't like this!" I feel a little sorry I'd gotten it in this predicament. [BL] (228 words)

I go to a man's house. It's a mess: dishes in the sink, beer bottles and full ashtrays on the dining room table. I start to wash the dishes. He comes home from work. He is tired and not very handsome. He is upset with me for interfering. I apologize and agree not to do any cleaning. So I ask him for the computer information I came for. He goes to his computer and I look out the window while I wait. I see lots of trees and I think they are very pretty. I notice one tree in particular. I think, "Why it's a mandala, the way the leaves form a lovely circle," (like an umbrella tree). Then another tree has leaves shaped like shovels (work crane shovels). The mandala tree has leaves shaped like birds of paradise. A woman comes to the window to talk to the man. She'd been picking berries in the field across the road. She invites him to a dance. He shrugs. She says, "Don't you want to meet eligible women?" He agrees. I feel a little left out and think, "Well, what about me? Aren't I eligible?" I have a feeling he and I are going to get together lovingly. (207 words)

I had taken a written test and the woman wanted the papers. I went over to the couch and got them and brought them to her. She says, "Oh, you haven't filled out the information part." I groan and sit to write. "The questions," I say, "are harder than the test." I see they want my mother and father's names. I write their names and then can't find the right line to put it on! There are a series of questions that require the answers "very" or "very much." I usually choose "very much," then some guy demands to come in and my husband and I refuse him. We are busy with this test and he is interrupting. He's very angry and tries to force his way in. We block the door. Then he pulls a gun. He holds it on me and threatens to kill me and also rape me right in front of my husband. I jump him and we wrestle for the gun. I finally get it and run outside and hide it and come back in and hide beside the couch. Some woman tries to cover me with an afghan while the guy's not looking. I hide behind the couch, sandwiched between two huge couch-sized cushions. (210 words)

I am flying into outer space; no space ship, just my body. I land on a planet. There are bad creatures there like zombies that take over your body. Some of the people are already taken over and you don't know which one is which. One is coming after me. He's got a ray gun and starts to pour purple rays into me. I fire back. He laughs. It won't hurt him. "You might as well give up," he smirks. I increase the rays, but he only laughs more. Suddenly I slow the pulses of the rays down. Now he's in trouble. He falls, stunned. I pick him up and slam him time after time against the ground, which finally kills him. Now I'm another person watching and I say, "Take his gun." We go into the jungle, uphill. Many other people are there too. I say to my companion, "Lots of them are the enemy already. For all I know you may be too. If you make any funny moves, you are dead." We walk carefully up the hill through the jungle. (183 words)

My baby goes into my Grandma Mildred's bedroom and wakes her up, only it's Grandma Agnes. I go in after her, shushing her and taking her out. I see in the kitchen that Grandma has started a pancake breakfast. I try to flip the pancakes so they'll cook, but it's messy. Then Sonja comes in and I walk out with her. We are in the back seat of a car. She is very caring. and hugs me. I return the hug and tell her thanks for the books she sent. I particularly liked the Beverly Cleary one. Sonja smiles and says, "But what about the other one? It's more important." I say, "It was interesting trying to weasel out of having to say I haven't read it because it's a Christian book." I get out of a car and start hitchhiking. A street cleaner (huge vehicle) yellow, stops. The woman driver looks at me and I say, "I'm going the other way for a few blocks. Is it OK?" She says, "Sure," and turns the machine around. Then she hops out and pours coffee in pretty china cups for the male crew. I think about her dual role of independent career woman and then being the server of coffee for men. Then the vehicle becomes five wheelchairs all hooked together in a row. We take off. (226 words)

I'm on a stage in a play. I do a bit and the audience applauds. I go off stage and change into my "Beaula" costume. I put white, drippy paint on my hair and beads that clatter down the center of my head and down the back of my head. Co-worker Juliet is there. I want to do a good "Beaula" for her. I think she's lesbian. I go on stage and the audience roars with laughter. I love it. Three other characters are on stage talking about my character. One man is homosexual and makes a joke. Someone asks if he does OK with his girls. He smiles and says, "Oh yes, I do well enough with 'my girls.'" It means he's got a double meaning there. I come back on stage and do this great wheelchair dance, first in duo with someone in a manual and then a wheelie popping solo. The audience loves it and applauds. Then I go for an encore bow with a Rose (a commercial product) and the audience is nonresponsive. I walk out on a stairway that is closed. The audience is blocked to me by a wall and I know they are there but I can't see them. I work hard to get them to respond. They finally do. (217 words)

I'm going to my school. I pass through a hall filled with booths that sell junk foods of all kind. I say, "I'll probably not eat much, but it's nice it's available." I get into an elevator. It goes up and then sideways. I travel a long tunnel which I think of as dragon's breath. It is smoky with misty swirls. It stops at my dorm room #451. I go in. My roommate asks which setting of light I prefer. There is "brilliant" and "dimmer." I choose brilliant. She wants dimmer. I give in to her. Now I'm on a couch and Jon sits next to me. He touches my breast and I lean over and whisper to him that if he does that again, I'll punch him in the face and yell out loud so people will know. He backs off a little, but hangs out close by on the couch. (152 words)

I am laying in a bed in a living room. Jared is laying on the couch across the room. It's night and we're getting ready to sleep. He starts talking about his beliefs in aliens in space. Something interrupts him and he stops talking. I do not encourage him to start up again, and then I wonder if his feelings are hurt, so I start the conversation again, saying how interesting I find the subject. I noted in the dark room that a gumball machine had been put up on the wall under Tom's picture. I think, "Who had the nerve to decide where to put my gumball machine?" I am annoyed. Then I notice we have fleas. I think about Howard and wonder if, since we never make love anymore, if he has affairs on the side. I decide that it's OK if he does. A woman says, "Oh, I think he does. I once talked to a little girl who said he was going to be her daddy soon." (171 words)

I am a kindergartner or first grade teacher. I can't remember which because I haven't been doing my job lately. The room is a mess. Things are all over the floor, furniture stacked. I'm talking to a woman, I think it's my mother. Archie sits on a chair and I put my head in his lap as we talk. He feels uncomfortable and gets up, still talking. He gets something and returns and sits. I sit up so he can sit in the chair and I lay my head on him again. Sensual, pleasant. I was thinking he didn't like my liking our friendly contact. I turn on lights. We are now in a kitchen. Marjie Lawrence comes by. We are shocked by her appearance. She looks a little like Thea. She wears a scarf over her head, big 1950's glasses and heavy eye makeup. She looks sick. My mother says, "Look, here's Mabel," and I say, "I didn't recognize you." She says, "Yeah!" Her eyes are giving her trouble, some disease. I see gunk on her eyes. She's trying to cover up the bad look with the scarf and glasses. She's embarrassed. She says, "Lord! I'll probably have to talk with Jerry!" I say, "Shh! He's around the corner." She looks caught. She stands up to leave and suddenly water pours out of her, a bladder accident. She stands there, disgusted, but can't stop it so just lets it flow. A young woman walks by and stares. Mabel just shrugs her shoulders. I get up out of my wheelchair to get paper towels to help clean up. I feel good I can do this. I want to ease her embarrassment. I tell her this has happened to me before. We are cleaning up the floor and a woman says, "Can I be of help?" I say, "Sure. Come on in." She helps sweep up pieces of cut paper that are littered all over the floor. (326 words)

The acting class is putting on a show. In order to see, I go up on stage, on the lip before the curtain. 2 girls are singing and a man is playing the piano. I don't see the man, only the piano, but I know they all met at a class and got together. The women are singing a blues song. The curtain, which is a white burlap-like cloth, is stuck so only a portion of the stage is visible. I sit on a chair in the corner. Bonnie is with me. At the end of the song, one woman clicks her fingers and a square spotlight pops on. She hopes to get in it. Then the curtain opens up. I thought it was broken, but they had deliberately had it closed to focus on just their act. Now the scene is tables and chairs like in a cafeteria. The women borrow Mateo to be a part of the show. Bonnie is very proud. She has a magnifying glass and looks at the audience. "Look at them," she says. I look. I say, "They look like a film clip of the Nazi audiences." Bonnie says scornfully, "You would see that with just your glasses." I feel angry at her. I look and see it is so. I again use the magnifying glass. Now I see huge people. The women then sing another song where Mateo slides on his butt across the stage. They shove him and whisper, "Come on," because he's not sliding right. He whizzes past us and off the stage to the audience floor. Bonnie is very angry and gets up in a huff. She won't stay here any longer after that! I sit her down and hold her shoulders and say, "Stop it. You are being too sensitive." She huffs off. Some women students are walking past me to go to the audience. One pushes her program into my face, across my eyes. I grab her hand and pull it away sharply. "That hurts my eyes," I say. "Oh, it's just a soft piece of paper," she says. "It gave me a paper cut," I reply. She apologizes. A guy comes out on stage and does a monologue to some women in the audience. They come up on stage. They are "planted" student actors. One woman takes my seat because she's tired. I stand there, wondering if I can manage. I see a picture that is funny. Two pages with a hole cut out of the top one so my top half is superimposed on the bottom half of another picture. It's my back. I am in the wheelchair. The bottom half is a little girl on a tricycle. I think it looks strange. A student (woman) is late and says, "Start the scene without me. I'll get my props and be back in time to hop out of the envelope." (484 words)

I'm at a school. I'm outside. It's time for the children to come in. Some of the boys run and play hide. I yell at them to stop playing around and get in here now! They hide in the grass. I hold an umbrella and go over and poke them. They get up, except one who doesn't move. I realize he's dead and I pick him up quickly and pull out a clod of dirt from his mouth and give him artificial respiration. He regains his breath and I yell to the boys, "Go tell Claude (my good-looking friend) so we can take him to the hospital." They run. I carry the boy and joyfully I see Claude has gotten the word and runs for a car. He meets me and we get in. The kids are all screaming that they want to come. I tell them that to be helpful they need to quiet down and back off. I pull one boy off the car. Then I look down at the boy's face in my arms. A clock sack is over his head and I say tenderly, "I saw you smile!" I feel relieved. He's going to be OK. (200 words)

A young man is interested in photographing me. I lie on a table and try different poses. I'm very selfconscious because he is encouraging me to look sexy and I tell him, "I don't think I can do that." His woman assistant brings me a plate of very spicy, hot sauce foods. I take a taste and then explain, "I can't eat those kinds of foods because if it's scratchy or spicy, it could cause my throat to spasm." I suggest we drape the table with black fur. They then push the table out to the edge of the cliff that overlooks the sea. The young man is very young, like in high school, and yet he owns this huge house by the sea. He houses lots of children that are homeless. He makes his money by collecting things and selling them. I comment that I tried photography and did pretty well, and after I fix my camera, I'll do it again. I remember I'd always wanted to have a relationship with a photographer but this guy, although he really likes me, is far too young. I see a picture of a baby's face and it unfolds to become a woman's face. I am very surprised. I look at the waves and see a Conestoga wagon from years past being washed up on shore. I tell the young man so he can collect it and make lots of money. There are lots of younger children around us. We take care of them and care about them. Now, I'm looking out the window at the sea. He stands next to me and says he really likes me. Maybe if I wanted, he could grow up and we'd marry. I smile sadly. I say, "That's very sweet, but unrealistic. I am 45 years old" (I was embarrassed to tell him how old I was). He pauses...45!...but he accepts it. I move away, feeling sad. A woman friend comes to talk to me. She tells me that "Dwight" has completed my rooms, so we go to look. I had found a wonderful old wooden wardrobe with lots of books in it and got it cheap for only $30 dollars and Dwight was going to build a room to put it in. My woman friend takes me to the door, which opens two ways. We go out to a quiet, austere room with bunk beds and lots of books - I suspect this is Dwight's room - and into my bedroom. He chose aqua marine green as the color, flowered curtains and a bedspread like in (Agatha Christie's Room). I say, "Oh, no books." My woman friend says, "Oh well, the Road Master chose not to build bookcases." "Well, we'll see about that," I say. I am not upset. I just know there's a reasonable explanation. I peek into a small, adjoining room. It's a dressing room. All my clothes are hung on special racks I can easily reach and there are hand rails so I can stand supported. I smile. He thinks of everything. I try on a dress. "Oh! How fat I look," I moan, upset. The friend tells me to not be worried, just be what I am. We rearrange the long sash and then I see five or six pink beautiful dresses that are all alike, hanging up. I say, "Oh! these dresses. Just in case there's a wedding." I wink, hoping she takes it as a joke, but I realize I'm serious. One of the dresses is for a small flower girl. I look back to the bedroom and see a window. I look out and see a flowered courtyard. To the right is a huge picture window. "That's a lucky person," I say. Then, in the room I see a door. "Is this the exit?" I say. I walk through into a kitchen. I realize then that he's built me a complete suite. The cupboards are the right height and depth for me to easily reach things. Only the foods I like are on the shelf: pizzas, cans of hamburger casserole, "corn chip brand panty hose." I go around the corner and see my picture window and, of course, all my books! I go out into the courtyard, only it's a sort of garden room, "where you can have a party if you want," he says. I walk to him and hug him. He is grown now and the right height. My woman friend tells me he's really older than I thought. He'd actually dropped out of high school for some years to build up his business, so he's more like 25 or 26. It's still pretty young, but more acceptable. I am so grateful and touched that he provided so accurately for my every whim and desire. We are just standing there close and feeling love and being loved. (Insert scene after photography session.) The table becomes a circus train. The woman friend is up in the engine car on the passenger side. Dwight is the engineer. Then he becomes the Head Family Man, the boss that orchestrates the details of keeping this family together. A married woman is being promiscuous and I see her coupled sexually with a midget. Dwight tells her to stop. (878 words)

I'm going up a mountain trail in my wheelchair. I see the crest of the mountain looks like a huge eagle-type bird. It's so real, I think I see real feathers. Then as I approach it, I see it is a real bird, only smaller now. I'm a little afraid of it. Now other members of my group come up. Each one tells me they have four or five in their group and have other things to do, so they won't be joining my trek. I am concerned and say, "I understand you'd like to do this other thing but everyone is pulling out and I can't make it with only two women to help in case my wheelchair gets stuck." The man (Tim) says, "Are you listening to what you are saying?" I say, "I know, but it's true." (140 words)

I am Buffy St. Marie, and Frank Sinatra comes by and likes me. We kiss. He's concerned that he's too old for me, but I assure him I like him just fine. We go to my mother's house. She pulls strands of beads (Indian Wampum beads) off a peg and gathers them up for my dowry. I notice she's not bringing them all and we insist she bring the full dowry. She does not approve the marriage and doesn't like me, but she reluctantly complies. (85 words)

I am in the back seat/trunk of Ginny's car. She's backing into a gas station to get a tire fixed. I say, "I've done this before." A good-looking Spanish/Mexican guy is driving. He and Ginny are trying to decide what night we should all go out and have fun. Wed. night is suggested and I say, "Sure. Sounds good to me." Then he turns and looks at me and says, "Are you already taken?" meaning do I have a relationship with Hector? I say no. He smiles. I get out of the car and find us all now in a tall thick tower. We are way at the top. He has a small baby in a pink sling strapped to his chest. He's going to take care of her for a while. I think that's neat. I look down and get scared. I say, "Ginny, how do we get down?" She says impatiently, "You climb down." "How?" I cry out. She points to a spiral tower with lots of coffee cup-like handles all around it. "Just step on them and go around and around until you're down." "I can't." I wait. She looks at me disapprovingly, like I'm acting like a baby. So I try. I grab a handle and put my foot on a toehold. The tower sways and goes around and I cling, going down one scary step at a time. (233 words)

I'm in an exercise class and then go to my dorm where I'm a head resident and feel rushed, needing time for quiet without people, but not slowing down to get it. I go to a cafeteria to get some food. I want a glass of milk. A boy hands me his cup. It had milk in it, so he rubs it clean and gives it to me. I thank him and pick up a pitcher to discover it is water. Another one has gravy in it. No milk. I buy some cheese, please and chips. (96 words)

I am remembering a tragic time I call the Sorrow of Tears (Summer of Tears). I see in my mind's eye my people's things being destroyed by the murdering whites. I am seething in anger and revenge and sorrow as I see them dump over a huge trailer with our house, who are killed. The feathered headdresses and staff are broken and defiled. I am heartsick. But in great sorrow, I realize I cannot kill in return. I pray for my hurt people. (83 words)

I am in a house next to a larger house. A woman is afraid. Some evil man might come out of the larger house and enter my house and kill me. I lock doors and feel terror. I get in bed and suddenly realize I've locked myself in with the woman (she's in bed with me), and in fact she is the evil that is trying to kill me. I run, afraid, and fight her off. (76 words)

I am in bed asleep. It is a small, narrow room. Ellie is asleep in a single bed across the room facing me. Theresa (client) sleeps on the floor by my bedside. [drawing is shown in journal.] She wants to be comforted. (Theresa slowly slinks up into my bed, hoping I won't wake up and throw her out. I am very aware that we are both naked and am concerned because it is not proper to let your client sleep with you. But I also am aware of her childlike need for comfort. I feel the softness of our skin touching and wonder if this will be sexual. But it doesn't feel that way. I pat her curly hair and arrange a barrette, thinking maybe no one will find out. I let her sleep (all the time I was pretending to be asleep myself). (139 words)

Merle and I are talking about the IBM floppies that I loaned him. At the same time as I'm listening to him, I am interested in reading a 25-page letter of introduction on this woman that I find interesting. It is hard to concentrate on two things at once. Merle is explaining how a man lent him some floppies and I said, "I'd like to copy them." He said, "The man wouldn't approve." I say, "Hey, he doesn't mind getting mine, but he minds sharing his?" I don't like it. I see trees in the yard out the window behind Merle. Meanwhile, I am reading backwards from page 25 to 1 of this woman's history. I am surprised to learn she is from a black family, as she looks completely white. But there is a picture of all her relatives and they are all black. One of them, an Aunt Ana, is surrounded by police. Some notoriety is attached to her. Merle says, "Don't feel bad. Even though she's written a lot, only one book has been published and it's only sold 22 books," (20 of them to her Aunt). I see her book collection and I'm pleased. We have the same reading taste (Jr. Classic books from V. shelf). I wonder if she is a lesbian. (217 words)

I park my wheelchair in the hall out of the way of traffic. I go into my apartment. It's a long, narrow hall. I lock the door and leave the light on. I go through the next door to the living room and leave that door open so in case someone tries to break in, I'll hear them. (58 words)

My husband (Harrison Ford), my two sons and I move to a new house. It is spacious and well built. Lovely. We are going through the rooms, looking. My husband is an intense, crazy guy that keeps to himself, but now he is walking in the house with the oldest son. My husband has a hurt foot and he leans on the son and they race together like in a 3-legged race. I watch and feel good at their moment of closeness. Then my husband releases the son, who goes outside and I watch in a growing horror as my husband prepares and then dies. He uses a white wire coat hanger, with the hook cut off, to stab himself in the forehead. I wonder how he can stand the pain. Then he pours gasoline on the wire hanger and lights it. I realize he's going to burn himself to death. The flame slowly goes up the hanger and catches to his hair. I wonder at his taking such a slow, painful death. Surely there are easier ways! Finally he is consumed in flames and falls over stiff and charred. I go to him and feel the stiffness of his arms. Then I succumb to intense sadness and mourning. I weep and refuse to leave the house for weeks. We are in a new house, a new town, and I know no one and don't search anyone out. After several weeks, an older man comes to the door. I open the door and look out at the neighborhood. I see a small store (grocery) nearby. It all looks pleasant. The man invites me to friendship, but I refuse. He leaves. Later, I decide the two boys and I will go for a bike ride. I ride my husband's old bike. We go down a perfectly straight path (sidewalk) to its end where we see a beautiful ocean and marvel at the waves. There is a house next to the sidewalk. It is the old man's. His butler opens the door and invites us in. At first I hesitate and then we come in. The butler immediately takes a bath in the curtained bathtub in the living room. The boys go play. I sit and talk about the ocean with the man. He smokes a cig and I am glad because then I can smoke. I go to check up on the boys. They'd gotten into some things in another room, a series of wooden cut outs, pictures. One series spelled RUNAWAYS. I was supposed to rearrange the letters to form a different meaning. I think the old man has cancer. Later we are in a race and he and I run together, winning. Someone says, "It was set up that way by her husband. He ran the race last year and chose to tie with the old man and then created the rule that next year the same people would end at the same place in the race, so it's only fitting that Rabbit 2 (his wife) take his place."

I go into a bathroom, and when I open the door, I see a dirty old man sexually hitting on two kids. I slam the door shut fearfully and run to a close phone to call for the police. Then I realize I'd left the kids in there with him. Before I have to go back in there to get them, he lets them out and then he comes out to get me. I retreat back into the room. He is a horrible, mean man. Now there's a little mouse he torments. I wait for the police to come and save me. Somehow he goes away. I go back in the bathroom and look around at his lair. I see shelves and a secret trap door into the attic. I pull a chain of beads that somehow represent my Aunt's eyes. She's dead many years. I shudder and go up the shelves to have a look. Perhaps there is treasure up there. Maybe he's up there, or a trap. I am scared and then throw myself up quickly and peek around and zip back down quickly. I do this over and over, each time using my arm and hand to sweep out of the attic anything I touch, hoping like crazy I don't touch anything awful. There are dust, dirt, layers of rotted away stuff, but nothing else. Then I see a lighted glass case that has my "Aunt's" favorite things. They are glass articles: statues of head and shoulder, pictures of her in her favorite pose, hats with feathers, coiffured wigs, pretty things. I guess she liked to see likenesses of herself.

I meet a used car salesman, Mike R. We go on a tour of Russia. I receive letters from disabled people who enjoyed my writing. One woman simulates a 9-day camping/fishing trip with her husband because she was so inspired by my writing. Our group sees a train that has finally been made wheelchair accessible. It's run by FIRE. And that is repeated in an important way. I see the ornate circus like cars with tubes of steam and fire coming out of it. I walk ahead of the group and run, enjoying the movement. I go too far and they turn left and I run back to catch up. I see a slow MR woman at the end. Then I have a conversation with a Russian boy (teen). He says something about eating something. I am shocked because if he eats it, it will be harmful to him. He is doing it as a sacrifice. I say, "Bear and Eagle, there is a difference. I would never do that" (harm or kill self for sacrifice). I have my books and try to sell them. I buy a mineral water and a grape soda (both l/2 full) at a store. At first, I was going to take them, but decide to be honest. (213 words)

A young woman hugs me. She likes me. I say to the group as a joke, "Hey. We've been going steady for 45 minutes, it's time to have an anniversary (reunion) party." I walk away. Spencer Tracey and I leave. He's helping me. There are two vans exactly alike and people are putting my things in the wrong van. I show them it's the wrong van because the passenger side window has cracks in my van. So we transfer my boxes and papers to the right van. I am impatient. It's taking too long. (94 words)

A man is helping me to get away. He's walking through thick mud and dragging me. He gets a stretcher so it's easier. I am annoyed and complain about how he's not doing it well enough. We come to a country border gun. He hands the woman guard my papers, but they aren't the right kind. She calls over this guy. I am using the man's name and I memorize it so I won't blow the crossing. The name is Abduhl Ram Neish. Twice we try to cross. Then they give me the correct paper and then another man comes out and whispers to my man and I ask what he said. My man says, "So, do I look Swedish?" meaning he'd chosen a Holland name but looked dark-complected and Arabian. An error. They take him away. Two small boys are with us and I tell them to stand over there, where they will be safe. Then several men come to me and say, "Come with us." I realize they are going to kidnap me and at first I feel like giving in and just doing what they say. But then I change my mind. I say loudly, "Hey! These men are trying to kidnap me! Why are you kidnapping me?" I loudly keep up this monologue. They are very angry and shush me but I don't stop. I'm attracting people's attention and the men give up and go away. (240 words)

I'm in a living room. There's a big storm outside. My three daughters are with me. I've been packing clothes. Dovre and I go into the kitchen to cook something. I heat up something like a tortilla on the stove burner and then show Dovre the beautiful design that got burned into the thing. It's a silhouette of a stately old-fashioned woman. Now there's something about pancakes. Then Paulina is cooking spaghetti stuff that will be dinner, but is also some kind of xmas ornament being made. The red globs of decoration are also a sauce for the spaghetti. We made a sail boat and a cathedral. Paulina puts the spaghetti on a plate. I say, "That's not enough protein." She plops on beans. I say, "We need meat." (129 words)

Now Ellie is pushing me in a manual wheelchair. We had decided not to use the power chair, too many stairs. We are going to look at an astronaut exhibit. We pass a man who has a disease and I wonder how he can stand the pain. His nurse also has the disease. We struggle to get to where we're going, but keep coming up to stairs. We see glasses all in a row and Ellie decides to buy Paulina a gift of four glasses (small, decorative drink glasses). I point out some, but they are expensive, so Ellie gets some at 50 cents each. She also buys a monkey for Paulina. We take the monkey to her and I suddenly ask a woman, "But how can we fly it to Houston, Texas? This will not work. We'll have to return the monkey." I pat it on the head like a cat. It starts to nuzzle my finger and I'm afraid it will bite me with his hard, sharp teeth. But I am surprised it only sucks on my finger like a baby, no teeth.

I am being hunted down by Lorne (Lucy's ex). He is an evil man. He's trying to kill me. He coaxes me into the back of something like a pickup and I realize he intends to run it over the cliff and to kill me. At the last second as it is going over the cliff, I hurl myself out and claw my way back on land. He didn't see, so I crawl into a garbage area at this little roadside counter. I fall asleep from exhaustion, hoping I'd made the right choice of staying so near. I hoped he'd think I was dead over the cliff, and baring that, that I'd run far away in terror. I wake suddenly realizing he and his men were there. A man stands right next to where I am. I hold my breath in fear they will find me out. This man nearly does but I luck out. They go away. I then run as fast as I can back toward my home (a castle many miles up the mountain). I remind myself to walk on rocks and hard places as often as I can so I don't leave trails. I pass houses and beautiful Alpine meadows. Now a young man is with me, perhaps a brother. We come to his castle. He says, "You wait here, I'll go in and talk with my sister to get us help." I close a big thick book I'm holding and say, "I will go with you. Why didn't you want me to go with you?" I am suspicious. We go in, now finally I am in my home castle. The evil man is coming for me. He's at the gates and hurling insults and threats as well as arrows and spears. My brother succumbs and starts to open the gates to him. I bellow in fear and fury, "NO!" and rush to the castle walls to cut the rope releasing the boiling oil that I had placed there secretly. My servants had put it there at my orders. The oil pours out all over the evil man. They scream in pain. I throw a fire brand down and burn them to cinders. I stand there, exhausted. My brother is wounded. Then several goddesses come down from on high and touch my brother so he may be healed and live. They touch me too and say, "Now you are one of us. You are immortal now. No one can hurt you. You are safe." "But I'm not ready yet," I say. Now I am Phyllis G, singing a Wagnerian opera to a man I loved but never told. I sing, "If I could say what I must say, I would say...." It is a very sad and powerful song. (463 words)

I am seated next to a young man who is a beginning practicing Ninja warrior. He's doing an intricate knife dance where it looks like he has four hands he uses to spread the fans or fabric out smoothly with intricate hand movements. At one point, he starts to move his foot to help out, but stops and looks at me to see if I saw. A real Ninja wouldn't have been that amateurish or clumsy. I smile as I watch. This other guy and I (like kids) suggest we all go practice and play Ninja. He hands me a knife and I swish it around. Now the visiting team shows up. I go out into the hall to get a drink of water and see, at the end of the hall, the room where we will have the competition. I go in. There is water and towels. After some ritual movement, I wipe up with the towel. The Ninja seems quite secretive and happy. He keeps saying, "Good, now we'll soon know. We've got samples now. We'll examine them and then you'll get your own flag (ship?)." He leaves, muttering to himself, "I know how we'll get it in, but I don't know how we'll get it out." The feeling is this is really an alien and he's going to renovate me (my body) in someway. I feel honored and a little scared. I pass a guy (like Coach) in the hall and say, "They said I get my own knife." "Good for you," he says as he walks by into his office. "And my own flag," I finish at the closed door. There is a pause and then he opens the door, grinning to me in wonderment. He sits down, inviting me to come in and tell him all about this extraordinary honor. He's at a loss to understand how or why I've been so honored. I start coughing and feel a spasm in my throat coming on. [I wake up coughing like a near spasm had occurred.] (330 words)

A group of us are watching TV. Five of them cuddle up in a group and I'm seated in a chair perpendicular to them. I say, "Hey, now I can't see the TV," because they moved it. So I move over with them. I'm right next to them but not "in the group." A policeman is on TV. They are talking about his history. He's Indian and was once a chief. (They show him in his headdress.) Now he just passes for white. A man comes in to fix the thermostat. I say, "But will it get too cold now?" He assures me it won't. The child is being stubborn and difficult. She wants things to go her way. I try to comply, but get tired. As the mother, I follow her. She goes through a box and comes out in another room. I follow. I see a man with a gun. I hide in the closet and the child has a gun and shoots the man. She looks for me for reassurance, but I'm hiding. (176 words)

Elliot is at the beach. He's written some stories. I offer to read them and give him feedback. I worry that I'll hurt his feelings if he isn't any good. Then a woman comes over to me and says, "Pardon me. I think you should know that in mid-August the seas will part." I see behind her the seas parting and then a tidal wave rushing in. She says, "Those who go to church will go to one side, the others to the other side." This man is very arrogant and so we won't get married. An older woman steals Fluffy by putting her in her purse. I hear her crying and open the purse and let her out. "Is that you Fluffy?" I murmur. People keep trying to steal her. I say to someone, "That's the third time." Now the man goes up a long, narrow chute. He is not afraid. Men come sliding down the chute yelling, "Look out!" Rock slides are coming down in a rush. Suddenly, the man realizes he's in danger and slides for his life, the roar of danger loud in his ears. He escapes with his life and is now humbled and wants to marry me. He follows me around, kissing me. (209 words)

I'm in a house and must rush to shut the doors because the killer bees that got my brother Jake are coming for me. I don't want to see Jake because it would look horrible. I see the outline of the angry horde of bees in the metal door. They are literally pushing straight through the metal. I run for outside, realizing that's stupid; they'll find me easier. So I decide to fly. I go way up and realize it's very, very bitterly cold. I could freeze to death. I see a door to a room and Jerome is in there. So I decide to dive to warmer air, but the winds are hurricane force and buffer me around terribly. I struggle. Also I'm driving through clouds and can't see anything, so I don't know where the land is and could crash any moment. I pull the cord on my parachute. Bad mistake! The winds drag me all around. I feel with my hand for trees and mountains and crash very painfully into trees. (174 words)

Wayne R has a computer. He's got it on a cart and going down the hall. I follow, asking questions. We go to a room where he sets the computer up. I ask how many bits because it seems small. It only has 630K. Then I type for him. He kisses me passionately. I respond and kiss back passionately. Then I say, "Oh no! You're married," and draw back sadly because I want him. Then another man and his secretary come in. I set up their computer. He codes in lots of numbers. It's for playing games. They crowd our stuff over and I end up sitting in front of a tiny portable typewriter. I get it out of there and try to fit in the cramped quarters. Now I'm driving home. I'm parked in a wide spot next to the freeway. I'd put up a sign advertising puppets. They were the man's and I'd show how they work to people. A carload of people stop. The woman wants to see the puppets. I say, "You bet," and go to the back of the van and dig around. I can't find the puppets. I find a computer part that opened up into a puppet like a transformer toy. I take it to show the people saying, "Sorry. He took the puppets with him. But I can show you these. Plus I've written two books and have hand puppets of the characters. I'll show you those." The people are disappointed. I'm improvising and wish I'd never started this whole thing. The woman offers to go take the sign down. I ask Ellie to go find my hand puppets. She doesn't want to, but does. (283 words)

I'm taking a mechanics class. I'm in a wheelchair. I ask permission to open the hood of the car we're working on and try to diagnose where or if there is engine trouble. The teacher sneers and says, "Sure, go ahead and try" (we haven't covered this in class yet). So I look at the engine. I turn knobs and pull dipsticks out. I have trouble deciding if the engine is l quart low or not and do the dip stick twice. I decide it's l qt. low. I'm doing well, to the teacher's and class's amazement. Then the engine is on and there are sparks and little zigzags of electricity. The teacher goes in and crawls on the engine. I say, "Be careful." Later, he is walking away from me and has my journal book. I race up to him yelling, "If you don't give me my journal, I'll take this hammer and pound in your fucking head." I sufficiently scare him and he gives me the journal. (169 words)

I enter a lovely huge room where lots of people are. I walk past a long dining table toward a second room where I'm told there are Dee Dee's rich Uncle's glass bell scales. I look in and the room is filled with beautiful glass objects. We're not supposed to go in yet. So I see Dee and decide to go sit by her since she has a rich Uncle. I pass up a wooden high chair and sit on a wooden dining chair. I remember she was always refined and smart, so I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that she has a rich Uncle. Later I decide to choose a room and at first go to a plain room out of habit. Then I say, "Wait." I look around. I mentally review all the rooms and, since I don't see any I like, I envision one I'd like to be there. It's all glass, a balcony and it has beautiful glass and crystal objects that shine rainbows like a prism all over the room. I use this room to write in because I become mesmerized by the lovely rainbows printing about the room, and I go into a trance, so my writing comes up straight from the subconscious. (210 words)

I'm in a huge house. I am seated on a couch with Bonnie. Some woman is teaching us something. Then it's time to go. I get up and pick up a heavy pack, a purse and two other carrying things. They are heavy and I put them on. Then I see some of my hand-written stories under the cushion of the couch. I'd been sitting on them. I pull them out, glad to see them, and have some difficulty keeping them in the right order. There are no page numbers. One is a full page of dialogue about a girl crying. I pack them into my pack and start to walk away. I see letter, an empty glass, etc. I say to Bonnie, "I'll clean that up later. I'm tired now." But I then realize that it will be days before I return and other people will use this space. So I decide to clean it up. I take the stuff to the trash can and put the liquid into a sink. So we go out to a long curved ramp rather than the stairs. Bonnie and this woman go ahead of me and call out directions. We get to the bottom and the woman says she'll get the patient named Sam to UR tomorrow. We are impressed with her determined, positive outlook. It normally takes months to get someone in to UR. I feel something falling out of my shirt and I catch it. It is a miniature velvet pouch that I had put in another shirt. I am surprised I haven't lost it and am pleased. So Sam comes over and starts talking. He asks me what would I do if I had the farm. I answer by saying I'd want to have a relationship because it would be too much to do alone or I'd hire someone to help. I specifically don't want to do the ugly chores (shoveling manure, etc.) Then I get into a car, in the back seat, and we drive past airports with planes taking off and I see two mechanical people that are a promotional stunt for the airport. They do interesting tricks. I turn to watch as we pass. Then we stop and an invisible Sam signals he wants me to get out and go over to him. I do so, but feel hesitant. Sam grabs me, hugs me and kisses me. He wants a relationship. I don't. (407 words)

Friday. I decide I'm going to take a bath. I start the bath water and remember I need a certain piece of clothing that is in another room. I hesitate about leaving the water running, but decide to chance it. It's not far and won't take me long. I go out and down a long ramp to a big room that has counters like in a business office. I go to the back of the room to the bathroom, but the woman boss (Ann Bacon) is very agitated. They are very busy and I'm interfering. She says someone else is taking a bath and I must wait. I get anxious, wondering if my bathtub is overflowing. Finally, she reluctantly lets me in. I nod my head to the old skinny guy in the tub and say, "Excuse me." I get a piece of clothing and a purse off the shelf and go back out. I pass rows of counters. I bump one. It's on little wheels and rolls a little. I try to get it back like it was, but it won't, so I give up and hope Ann doesn't get upset more. I'm now walking up the ramp and I'm slow and tired. I try to walk faster, now very worried about how long I've been gone. The water is probably all over the floor and it will be a terrible mess to clean up, and I'm late already for an important something. I try to find an elevator and I do. It's in the library, but it won't go to my floor. So I get out and see stairs only. They go up, hit a platform and an escalator, conveyor belt thing as sloped down the other side, only it's rolling me back up to the platform. I go back where I came and finally get to my bathroom. The water is at the very top and has spilled over just a little. "Just as I imagined it would," I thought. I take off my clothes and see two men in the room. I decide I have to go to the bathroom and pee. I say to one man, "See we're like brothers and sisters. I can take off my clothes and pee in front of you." I am a little uncomfortable, but feel trust that it's OK. [There's a real sense of trying to prepare for a special occasion and being late and many things going wrong.] (390 words)

Saturday. I go downstairs to a room that is in the basement and sort of secret. I'm hiding. I lay on a table on my tummy. It's like a massage table. I'm facing the door with a window. I see people coming in search of me and hope they don't see me, but they do. They ask me why don't I choose one of the "roomettes" nearer the bathroom. I look around and see like partitioned spaces and choose one fairly close to the bathroom. Now I've been captured by a girls' school and am inside. I look around for a way to escape. I look out the window and see lots of bumpy rocks in a steep incline. We're on the 2nd or 3rd floor. I say, "It would be hard, but we could get out this way." My friend says, "No. They'd see us. It won't work." I give up. They come to take me to another room. As I leave my friend, she says, "I'm pregnant." I grin and say, "Good for you. With who?" She says, "With Timothy. I'm one month along." Just previous to this, I flew out of the room like I'm in a helicopter and hovered over a secret place in the rocks where naked men and women are together. So I see a big auditorium and the woman says, "Your group is called_______." I say "Do you mean that the Birds are now captured and will work for you now entertaining and that's our new name?" She says, "Yes." (257 words)

Monday. I go to Lucy's house to have breakfast. Lots of pancakes and good food. Lorne comes later and I am not happy he's there. I frown and grumble. He bumps into me and I pull away. I'm annoyed at Lucy for still having him around. After breakfast, Lucy, Justin and I go for a walk. We are talking. We go into a school. We see the students' art work on the walls. Now we go into a classroom. Bonnie is teaching. It's a chorus class. A well-dressed professional woman comes in to guest lecture, but the class is comfortable, casual and inattentive, so the woman leaves. Bonnie lectures them on their bad manners. I tell them this woman came to offer them her knowledge and they could have been more respectful. A group of men (seven or eight) get up and with noses in the air, walk out. "Good riddance!" I say and we continue the lessons. (158 words)

The elevator won't go, so I jump ten stories, hoping I won't hurt myself. I'm amazed at myself for daring to try it. I am OK and then walk lots of stairs. I see large masculine-looking women dancing together. One looks over at me and I look away. I don't like her. (52 words)

I am going to look over Howard' house to decide if I'll buy it. A man shows me the basement first. There are pipes that have liquid running in them and they are for heating. They are noisy and brightly lit. I think, "I'd change that." I see the man's room and servant's quarter. The bed is tiny and fills the whole tiny room. The walls are slanted like in an attic and I think, "How uncomfortable! Stingy Howard." We go up to the main living quarters. Now Howard's first wife (like his mother) follows us around. She's uppity and doesn't like me. The rooms are spacious and rich. I am in awe, particularly the kitchen! It goes on forever, sinks and preparation areas and more sinks and stoves and refrigerators. I step up to one sink and a conveyor belt moves, under my feet. I nearly fall over. Dovre says, "Be careful, that sink looks too complicated and sophisticated." I see a plainer sink and feel relief. I see a door that opens to a restaurant's kitchen. Howard bought it from them. A man comes in; he's the owner of the restaurant and wants the kitchen back. I feel a strong desire to have this house and feel afraid he'll get it and I won't. Howard says to him, "I haven't decided who will get the house. Maybe I will sell it to you." I turn away, hoping passionately I'll get it, but I don't want Howard to know it matters to me. I'd longed for a ritzy place like this and now can almost afford it. Now I get on an airplane, a small, private one. My father is piloting. We are going to see the house in his home state. All of a sudden we tip up and pull high into the sky. I see we had a fender bender with another plane. I get nervous because my father's driving like it's a car and doesn't have flight experience. I tell him, "We should call in a flight plan and get an assigned altitude." We arrive at the lovely rich house in Howard's home state. It's at 8200 feet and I wonder if I'll have trouble breathing at that altitude. I seem to be fine. (378 words)

I am in a house putting the dishes away, trying to decide where my things should go. I like the back bedroom, which has a bathroom and a small room adjoining it, but I have a baby and a 4-year-old, so I move into the front bedroom, which is smaller and a lavender color like a former house I lived in. There's a bathroom near it also. I put the baby in a closet for its room. I look around and see a sink in the room and then the baby is calling me. I go over and see that she's nearly naked and crawling out of the closet. I say, "Oh! You have a wet towel on you; that's not good." I pick it up and take it away. Then I see her diaper has fallen off so I pick her up and get a fresh Pampers. She hugs me and says in a sad voice, "You left me in there with a wet towel." I said, "I know. I'm sorry." She says "And no diaper!" I apologize again. "And no blanket! What were you thinking?" She scolds. I do feel bad and soothe her and say, "I'm getting it now. I won't do that again!" She continues to ask me questions about a conversation she overheard from the doctor and I try to explain she'll feel comfortable. I say, "It's perfectly normal to visit the doctor once every two weeks until you're six months old, and then once a month. And when you are a year old, you should be in your own room. I look down the hall at the other bedroom and wonder if I should move the baby and me back there. I say to the 4- year-old, "I do like the back bedroom better." The 4-year-old says, "And I like this one better." "Good, that works out," says I, then I realize I'd still be sharing a room with the baby, and then I remember the small room to the side. The baby leaps off the bed and heads for the back bedroom. I look startled. She calls back to me, "This is something I must do. I'm all right. The 4- year-old, very mean and jealous, starts after her. He's going to hurt her. I call out to him in a stronger angry voice and force him to return. I grab him by the shoulders and shake him, saying, "You leave that baby alone!" I am very angry at him. (417 words)

I am in my room. It is small and beautiful. The curtains have stars and moons on them, symbols of the cosmos. There is a typewriter. It seems to be a room for spirituality and writing. It is cozy and just right. John, a co-worker, comes in to give me a message. He seems nervous and klutzy. He'd knock over some papers and then have trouble getting them put back together. The roles were reversed. I was relaxed and calm and tried to soothe and reassure him. I leave the room. I see a huge, beautiful crystal on a table near my door. I admire it. Bonnie is there. Then Nate comes in. I am so glad to see him. We look at each other longingly. Bonnie goes and gets the van. She drives. Nate and I hug and lay down on the bench. It is so sexually exciting. I am throbbing in anticipation, but worried about if he has AIDS, is he still married, and is he still an alcoholic? We talk. Then we're at the movie house. It's the same one we were last together at. We enter through tiny door holes in the wall. Bonnie and Nate go ahead. I enter and see racked seating and can't locate them in the crowd. Then I see Bonnie waving at me. I'd walked too far in, so I back track and go to them. She was seated next to him but moves over so I sit beside him, between them. (251 words)

I'm in a room, seated in a rocking chair in a square pen (like a play pen). I am holding a 2-year-old baby in my arms. She's relaxed and resting. I am rocking and cuddling her. We are going to nap together. My mother shows me a gift she bought for my father. She got it months ago at the Expo. It's for xmas. It's a big fold-out display with things on it. I lay down with the baby. Now we're in a tent. I place my head near the rear flap to get fresh air. Someone points out how badly the fireplace chimney is smoking. I say that's because of the high winds. Lots of smoke is coming through the vents and the fireplace/stove looks swollen like there's lots of pressure from inside. (134 words)

I'm looking for some papers. I put some in a table and it turns out to be a mailbox. I see the phone book and other papers slide down a glass slot. Jennifer H calls and needs one of the papers. I explain what happened to it. Arvonne is getting ready to leave, to go to school. Bonnie is around. A young man in a wheelchair like Russ comes. He's demanding and arrogant. He expects everything to be done for him. He says he's the exchange student for the St. James Infirmary. He goes into a bedroom and I realize with a sinking heart, I'm the only one left to help him. He calls over the intercom when he needs something. He was very smitten with Arvonne's looks. (128 words)

She gets in. I am hesitant and then slide in the passenger side. He drives and I start to feel safer as more distance is covered. They'll never catch up to me now. (88 words)

I'm going to teach some people basketball and I'm calling them to gather around. I see that the hallway is too narrow and small and I tell them to go upstairs to a larger space. They are slow and complain. They are the parents of school children. One asks if we'll learn tennis. I say, "No, that's for spring. This is winter and we'll learn basketball."

I am in a bed semi-sitting up. H, Phyllis G and others of my women's healing group are there. The meeting is over and they are leaving. Hasani puts on a black leather-like coat and I see she's wearing shorts, but strings are hanging down like they are frayed. She and Phyllis are talking and I don't want to interrupt them, but it is important to tell Hasani so she won't go out like that and be embarrassed. I interrupt and they both look at the strings, which now looks like parachute pants legs that had been stuck together with a wad of gum. They clean the gum off and then they leave. Just as soon as they leave, I fall into a sleep and see purple images before my eyes. I feel sensual. It is pleasant. Then I see the faces of a man and woman kissing and I sigh and say, "I want that now. Yes I do." I really feel sad and wanting. Then I fall deeper into the sleep. I am aware of Hasani's image or spirit just behind my right shoulder. The room has changed. There are painted flowers or strawberries on the walls. I am curious about why this room. It is unknown to me. Then I feel waves of feelings sweep over me like a rush of goosebumps and become very still. I realize the spirits are in me to do the healing. I see a man enter the room, wearing black clothes, good-looking in a slick, Mexican way. Someone says, "Here is the devil. He has come too." I think, "I don't want the devil." So I called to the good spirits, the white light, and brought in more of them. My left leg slid off the bed and my foot was on the floor. I was a little afraid because the devil might be there, but I was paralyzed. I wanted to swallow but could not. I felt the spirits in my throat, healing it. I felt them all through my body. I saw giant cells and realized the spirits were in my DNA changing the coding so my arthritis would go away. I was pleased and in awe and observing all this while I was awake, but also aware that I was asleep and dreaming. I stayed with it as long as I could to get the most healing out of it. (402 words)

Now someone has checked the fluids in me and I see a plastic vial with some pink stuff in it. Some bad stuff is still there. We hadn't gotten it all out. There are two doctors then. A good one and a bad one. The good one had left me in the care of the bad one and the bad one deliberately didn't do part of the procedures so that I wouldn't get healthy and might die. They are going to do the procedure again and the bad one is smiling. The good one says to him, "Go on with what you were doing," and prepares to leave. I sit up and call out, "Wait. No. It must be you!" He agrees to stay. Someone says, "She must have 20 immersions in ice water baths quickly." Now things are going to be all right. I grab the breathing tube I must use that sucks out the fluid on the lungs and suck hard to help. Someone says, "She looks scared." I nod. I am; and determined. (176 words)

I am alone on a desert island and have been there for 10 years. I am naked and live in a cave and have all I need, except companionship. I see a boat landing and men coming up and out of the surf. I go there and the captain is threatening them with a gun. He follows me to my cave and ask me lots of questions. How old was I when I got there? Nineteen years. How old am I now? Twenty-nine years. He showed me a map of N. America and W. Germany. Did I recognize my island, Nol? I'm more around south, but I did see the scientist "Roe" that he is looking for. "Did you have sex with him?" I angrily ask, "Who do you think you are? My father?" He follows me and wants to go into my cave where I live, but I am aloof. I had not given him permission. He waits. I start to warm up to him.

I am getting out of my wheelchair to go into the bathroom. I start to do a dance and although I move slowly and with some pain, it feels good to do these dance movements. I go into the bathroom and I see a pretty village scene when I look down into the toilet. I am talking to someone just outside the door. I am looking up my brother Dwight's telephone number in my blue address book, but I can't find it. I see: Corinne 470, Lydia 475, A.S, Halloween 472, Kesi, Keshi, Kassee. There were other words and numbers. I laugh at Lydia and I'm nostalgic about the Halloween event. [BL] (111 words)

I see a pretty plant. I want to grow one and ask someone how I would do that. He says we have to get permission to dig a pond, and I say, "I own this land. We can dig here." He starts to dig in the front lawn but I say, "No, I want it here on this plot in the back yard." I see a very green space of lawn and open windows around it. He shows me different plants. I am particularly interested in the "Umbrella Plant." He shows me one that has no roots and he lifts it up. I worry that will kill it, but he says, "No," and puts it back on the sand. I say, "I want to help." So he sets me to the task of cutting off the tops of gallon plastic milk jugs. As I'm doing this, Bonnie comes by. She's very tired and stressed out from work. It's a Monday.

Those aren't the words, but that style is right. I feel relieved that she is still loyal. I watch the women dancers. They are modern women wearing black modern shoes and black pants and shirts, but over the black outfit is a red sparkly net material, like in India. They are lined up and dance in unison. (131 words)

I am preparing to be in a play contest. I struggle backwards through traffic as the crowd is all coming to see the play and I am trying to get around to the stage door. I'm in my wheelchair. I get back there and start talking to the other two actresses. I am nervous and suddenly remember that the play "Juba" isn't today! Thank goodness, because I don't remember my lines on that one, but I'm OK on "Rueben." Then I realize I'm playing two characters, a woman boss and a secretary. I choose two or three hats and try them on. The other actress says, "That one is too big. It will distract." I agree and then start to really get nervous because if I add the bit of switching hats, I'll forget my lines. I say, "Let's run lines," and the other actress says her line, "Don't you have all twelve done?" I respond, "There are three jobs times three," and then I realize those aren't the exact words. 3x3 doesn't equal 12. I really feel panicky now. It's twenty minutes until curtain and I can't remember the lines. My memory has gone blank. I pace, saying, "What will I do,? I can't remember my lines." The other actress eyes me in disgust. I say, "If only I could carry the script book or tape it." (228 words)

I am in a pickup and camper parked on the sand next to the ocean. I am looking for a small green rowboat that is coming in over the surf. I think, "That could be dangerous." I see one, but it's not the one. I look out and see the ocean tide rising and approaching my truck. I say to my father, "It's nearly up to the wheel. We'll have to move." I start to back up, but some one right behind me has opened up a brown box in the sand, sort of like an engine cover and he's fixing something. I say, "Hey, could you wait a minute on that so I can get by?" He just stares at me and then continues. So I go around him, realizing I could have done that anyway. I didn't have to ask him to move. I go to a house. I walk up a flight of stairs and at the landing, I see a bedroom. I go in and look. It's not for the guests. It is the owner's private room. I see a comfy bed and a fire going in the fireplace. I say, "How nice!" I see hundreds of books on shelves all over the walls. There's a mesh screen nailed over them with wooden strips to keep people from taking the books. I look at how they did that. Then I leave the room to continue up the next flight of stairs, only I'm called back downstairs by a flaming redheaded girl child. I approach her. She's outside looking in. She says, "Come downstairs and look. Quick!" I look at the long set of stairs and say, "No thanks! This is hard enough." Now I am going to my son's second grade class to see how he's doing at his new school. I fervently hope he doesn't have to sit next to the redhead. I am relieved to see he's not. The male, young teacher has me sit with three other parents who are also observing. He says, "I'll bet you'll feel better after seeing the actual situation your son is in." I agree. There is a box of audio tapes another parent (couple) has brought in. I choose some to borrow that deal with self-awareness and growth. I put the rest back in. (387 words)

He's a little embarrassed. I'm a little annoyed at him, keeping me waiting for no good reason. He points out some 45 records of Elvis of the 1950's. I almost decide to buy one, but decide I didn't really like him then, so why bother now? The man spills (pours) Pepsi down his shirt front and I laugh at his clumsiness. (122 words)

Then I look into a big room where counselors are meeting. I see Phyllis G. They leave and I see Hank. I say, "So you've come." He smiles suggestively and makes sexy jokes.

I am seated on a small stage area talking. I put on a furry hat (Robin Hood-like shape) with a bouquet or corsage of flowers on it. Some bad person comes up to us and I put on the hat and discover that I turn into a small fairy like Tinkerbell. No one can see me. So I hide up in the curtains. Then I flit down and move things, which confuses the bad guys. They look around to find me, but I hide again. Then I pick up a stick and pound the helmeted head of a bad guy, thump, thump, thump! I dent the plastic mixing bowl. They are astounded. Then there are two of us and she doesn't have her hat on and so is big and visible. The bad one sees her and realizes what's going on. I sit there and she sees me, even though I'm small with the hat on. She has learned to see us, so I'm not safe anymore. Now I go to a photography class. A door jamb frames a room of people dancing. A woman in red is very graceful and I take pictures, and then I get up and move around to get different perspectives and better pictures. I get close and see my own actions a part of the picture. I hold the camera out as I dance with them. Then I want to see the pictures. I open the photo envelope to see how well I did. They are pretty and interesting. One photo is a composite where a picture of a baby was cut out and pasted on this photo and has something to do with why I became visible as a small fairy. (288 words)

Then they continue and I get off the stage, get my jeep and drive it around so I can be closer to the stage, parking in an (obvious) no parking zone! I go back up on stage to sing. (95 words)

I have to go to the bathroom and I open the stall door. The toilet seat is way up high. I'm looking up at it. On the ground under it is a row of cigarettes and tobacco sacks. One is labeled "Sexless Tobacco." I reach up and pull the seat down. There isn't a toilet, only the seat. (58 words)

A girl is being noisy and interrupting. I get into a power play with her. I insist she be quiet and polite and I shake her. I put her in a high box. She starts goofing off and I insist she sit on the outside lip of the box so I can keep an eye on her. Then later I swim alone in the pool, relieved to have a few moments of quiet time.

I'm in a big, lovely house and am walking through the rooms. I come into a saloon or library. Some people are there waiting for me. I realize I teach a class and can't remember which lesson we are on. I whisper to my secretary to get me a copy of the workbook so I can get ready. I'm not worried. I know the material well. I see Brian K and we talk. He says he is an alcoholic and lowers his eyes, ashamed. I feel attracted to him. He had been swimming in the pool and I find his jockey shorts and have my attendant go wash them. I go back to my room and then return to teach, bringing the clean shorts with me. When I get there, I am embarrassed and don't want to just hand him the shorts. I am afraid he'll consider me pushy and meddling. So I put them in a corner shelf and ignore the problem. Brian has a stepson. The boy keeps a scrapbook and I find it, a diary. I start to read it because I want to know how his father thinks about me. I see photos done by the cosmetic/drug company that sponsors my talks, pictures of the customers in pretty clothes and flower corsages. Then I read about his father, but can't quite follow it all (on different pages, etc.). I have to go to the bathroom and go up to my bedroom. Arvonne goes by and I tell her of how I dreamed about Brian K and how he looked at me [a dream within a dream]. She leaves and I wonder why she's still around. I figure this is her last day. It is 11:00 and I get up out of bed and go upstairs. Now I'm at an outdoor cafe and I sit. I see across the courtyard Paul (Brian K). I want to impress him, so I take a small child and dance around, in my wheelchair. I am attracting everyone's attention. I am so graceful and playful. I look around, hoping I'm not going downhill too fast and won't go out of control and make a fool of myself. I don't. I return to my seat. I hear people saying, "She is everyone's little 'grandmother'" in Spanish and they all smile and applaud. I tease them and say, "Estoy no abuelita." They laugh and applaud. (398 words)

I'm in a house and there is pounding on the door and I'm afraid. I open the door and Mexican men come in. They are soldiers and they intend to rape my mother and me. Two get on top of me and kiss me. It's slimy and disgusting. They are grunting. I bite one on his finger as hard as I can. I want to bite through. He laughs. I feel sick but cannot cry out because if I do my brothers will awaken and come to my rescue and be killed. I grit my teeth and try to go numb so I don't have to experience it. I resign myself to it. Then I hear a noise. It distracts them and I break free. I run only to discover my father has opened the other door and more rapists are swarming in. My father is like a zombie. Then I'm out and scrambling. I see a log and a stream and realize my father is dead. I try to hide, but am forced back to the house. More horrible men. The place is crawling with them. Then I see an opportunity and sneak out to a hedge and crawl in. Soldiers walk past me in the hedge and I crouch and hide, narrowly missing being discovered time and time again. Their movements past me causes my pretty chiffon peach-colored dress to fan out and I pull it back in, hoping no one saw it. Other girls and boys are hiding in there and are found. I am near a cooking soldier and he almost discovers me. Then I see the tide is coming up and I soon can slip out to sea. I dive into the black water. They hear me and come in after me. I swim underwater for a long time with strong strokes. I know I'm swimming to my death, but it is preferable to the death and dishonor on shore. Then I hear a humming motor sound and I feel cautiously good. I go up to surface. It is an American sub. I swim to it. It's on the verge of attack and may be in danger, but it stops and a small lock is revealed. I turn the lock and open a small space. I am sad to see it isn't a porthole or hatch. I keep frantically digging. They take pity on me inside and open a hatch to a storage area full of iron boards, ropes and things. I dig in and the hatch closes and it's dark and nearly airless, but I know I've at least got a chance to survive here. (I wake up scared.) (445 words)

A giant easy chair is alive and tapping on the window at Grandma Mildred's house. (It's outside and I'm inside.) I laugh and go out on the porch and call to it like it's a horse.

I'm a beginning pilot and fly in my one-seater open airplane. I feel afraid to go too high because if I have trouble and crash, I'll hurt worse. Then someone else pilots and I goad them to go faster.

I am ooking for the bathroom and I'm in an elevator that is very crowded with lots of people. I am Lucile Ball, and I play with her comedy face. Is this the ladies room? I see the men and say to myself, "Just the lobby, I guess." I find an escalator going down only to see a sign for a second flight of stairs. I groan and then throw myself toward the stairs going, "Oh, Oh" as someone grabs my shirt from behind to steady me. I make it down without falling and go into the ladies' room where there is a series of platforms that act like conveyer belts for joggers, only bumpy, so it's like a comedy routine. I get tired of that and go back out and see old wheelchair toilets in a storage room and go in to use them, knowing I shouldn't. After I pee, a red light goes on calling the nurse. (159 words)

I am at a high school reunion. Darryl is there. He starts to kiss me and it feels wonderful. I open up to the feeling of love and want sexual pleasure. I then realize he's going to leave me again. I feel sad and hurt that it is a second time I will feel that hurt. I sit sadly looking out the window and I'm surprised to see the old M City High doors. It is painful to feel that nostalgia. I'm now walking down a road alone. It's a country road. I get off to the side and need to cross the fence to get back on the road. It's plastic like videotape or window slats on blinds. I bend one, feeling bad about breaking the fence. I get back on the road and see a school bus coming toward me. I think, "I don't want witnesses of the broken fence and me. They'll figure out I did it." I think of hiding on the other side in the woods, but I don't. The bus comes up to me. I look ahead and see a river crossing the path. There's no bridge. I think, "Hey, I'm going to get wet and cold." I try to ask the woman bus driver if I can hitch a ride. She signals that she can't talk to people when she's on duty and goes splashing through the river. I shrug and walk into the river. I get totally wet and it is cold. I get to the other side and discover I'm lost. I realize I'm in France. I ask some questions in French. I ask for a lottery ticket. The woman clerk (older woman) scrapes off the numbers to tell me I didn't win, and then she winks and says sometimes she changes the numbers for foreigners and she gives me a small tiny baby spoon. I am very grateful. I ask, "Which way to Paris?" She points the way. I walk on. (331 words)

A woman wants me to give her a decorative scar. I can't find my usual cutting device, so I use a paper and give her a paper cut. It hurts her but it works. I'd made a half moon cut and I push it to see if it had cut through. I see it open up and I see the cords of the muscles (like when I fished with my father). Then the blood wells up. I say, "Good. It will bleed and clean the wound." She is pleased. I had tried to put it on her chest, but it was on the top of her left arm. (108 words)

I'm in my bed and sleeping. A big friendly dog comes in and curls up with me, his big face laying on my head. He almost purrs, he's so contented. I am half asleep, half awake. I stare at the floor and see things move or disappear and think I'm in that almost asleep dream state. The dog curls up near my belly. I am delighted it's there, but surprised I have a dog. Howard comes in to get something. I am surprised that I had to get rid of him twice. He had returned and asked to live with me here in E City for awhile and I'd let him. We slept together but no sex. He was hoping to wait me out and I'd come around, but it didn't work. Then I'm in grandma Mildred's house. I see the bedrooms are expansive and filled with people. They are like sitting rooms now. I step out on the porch and walk past the storage barn. I stop and think, "No, that's exactly what I need to look into." I back up and peek in, but decide it's not worth the trouble. Nothing of value is there. I pass the barn; same feeling. I turn and walk up the driveway and see a double door that I knew wasn't in reality there in the real house, but decide to use it as a shortcut. I go in. Someone hands me an egg. It's raw on the inside. I decide to recook it. I turn on a burner and try to pick out egg shells. (264 words)

A man and I made a tape of our songs. We are invited to NY City to see the big producer. I find the building and go in. I'm in my wheelchair. Lots of his subordinates hover around me. I tell them to relax and not get so uptight about my disability. They are over-helping. I go into the big office. He's surprised I'm disabled and wants to forget the project. I tell him I only sing medium. Lots of people sing better, but my disability is a hook. Use it. I show him my Enrnestine book ideas. He's interested and says, "Let's meet after lunch." I go out and ask the secretary to help me find two papers. She's reluctant. I snip, "Oh well, don't bother." I'm angry at her, but realize it's probably a good lesson for me. I ask directions to a hotel. She points to several places on the city streets. I go in search of a place to rest and eat. (166 words)

There are four people in a car. I'm in the passenger side. I am supposed to read the map as we travel. The map is long and narrow, like the road. I have to work fast to keep up with our travels. I get tired. The man driver (we are a couple) gives me permission to fold up the map and relax. We stop because the man of the couple in the back seat has to go to the bathroom. He and she get out to use the woods. We decide to go join them and see them swimming naked in a basement pool. We take off our clothes and crawl through the hole to join them in what seems like an underground cavern, only it's tiled. They are at first concerned because it is dangerous to have us all in there at once, no one up there to go for help if we can't get out. But we relax and have fun, cavorting in the water. The woman decides to get out and swims across the pool and goes in through a door. We start to follow, only to discover we'd walked into an old woman's apartment. She is somewhat surprised to see wet, naked people. We apologize for coming in without knocking. I am a teacher and come in to the classroom. Students are coming in. I erase marks on the blackboard and write, "Barb Sanders, M.S. N.B.C.C. I explain that means I have a Master of Science in Counseling Psychology and am a member of the National Board of Certified Counselors. More students come in and I repeat that naming sequence, and yet again. Three students with rheumatoid arthritis in funny-looking wheelchairs come in and I talk to them. By now the room is very crowded and people are facing both ways as they are seated at long rows of tables. I ask if it would be better if I stood at the other blackboard where I am sideways to them all. We agree that is better. I again do the naming sequence. Then a couple talk and the man says, "Shut up," and smiles. I point out how this is passive-aggressive and begin my lecture on assertiveness, using them as an example. (376 words)

I am living in my parents' house. I am in the kitchen. A cute, round, delicate creature is flying gently around the room. It's a pet of my parents'. It's name is Paper. It's like a small, fat mouse sitting on a pretty, white, ruffly doily. It comes near me and I ask my mother if it will bite. She says, "No, just be gentle and don't move around too suddenly." It comes up under my chin and nuzzles. I pet it and feel very happy with it. I decide I want one of my own. My mother says, "They cost $5.00." I decide to buy two. I need to go to school. I go outside, but now I have to go back inside to change my clothes. I go into my parents' bedroom. My brother Dwight is now there. Now, I'm in my parents bed and Dwight is in there with me. He loves me and wants to make love. I feel sad and nostalgic. I kiss him on his cheek and pat him. I say, "I love you," meaning, "I love you but we can't have sex." I get up, sitting on the edge of the bed. There is a pile of clothes on the floor and I pick them up one at a time to find a proper outfit. I see my sexy K-Mart slip/skirt. No, it's too sexy. I pick up a red under-petticoat and a see-through turquoise skirt (like my Mexican dress). I explain to Dwight how it wouldn't do to wear them together. I see my jeans skirt, but that's too old and out of style. I pick up a pair of cotton white pants with pink 1950's designs on it and find a short sleeve blouse to go with it. At first I don't like the outfit, but after I button up the pants, they fit comfortably around my plump middle and the sleeves are long enough to cover my fat arms. I have trouble buttoning the blouse with my arthritic fingers, but as I slowly and patiently work on it, it gets all buttoned. I bend down and pick up several sacks of rocks. They are my father's rocks. Some are like my belly rock. Some are crystals and so on. I put them aside and go on out, headed for school. It's 10 of 1 and I'll soon be late. It's raining outside. I find a big elevator. (407 words)

I try to get off stage but it's too high, so a male friend comes over and puts his arms out to catch me. I hop and land on his shoulders and we precariously balance until I get safely on the ground again. We dance. Then my guy, who had been jealously watching, comes over and we dance. (118 words)

Nate is trying to kiss me and I push him away because Dovre is around and I don't want her to know of our relationship. I look out the window and see Dovre/Lydia driving an 8-wheeler truck. She has permitted the small children and Charla to sit on the back fender. I an very concerned. Charla will let go and fall. I worry and try to wave to Dovre not to let this happen. The truck starts, and sure enough Charla doesn't pay attention to her danger and lets go and is bounced off. I run to her and pick her up, relieved to see she is alive, but hurting to see the huge bump and cut on the back of her head. I hold her and soothe her as she cries. Then Nate runs up and tries to kiss me. My mother is there and frowning. I say to her, "Ah, he is the video repair man." To Nate I say, "See you tomorrow when you come to fix the video." He leaves. My father tells me I owe him $232.00 he lent me to fix the video. I feel downhearted because I remember I also owe someone $152. Too much debt. I see a package Nate left and open it. There are miniature rifles in it. I choose a pen to write up my list of debts. It's a calligraphy pen that occasionally writes in red. (238 words)

I am organizing things: putting birthday cards I'd received where they can be displayed better so I can see them. Then I go downstairs and We and my mother play 'wait til you see his new girlfriend' (Jake/Nate's cousin). I go to the kitchen door and she's there looking pouty and cute. "Where's Whoopie?" she lisps. I laugh and look in at my mother and Lydia. "She's here," I giggle. "Is Whoopie anywhere?" I accept her way of lisping. My mother whispers to me, "Be careful! She's powerful." I laugh and lead her upstairs to find "Whoopie." She follows arrogantly, telling where she'll put her things. She looks older now, maybe 50, 55. Then Jake runs past saying hurriedly, "It's almost time for the Royal." We all run after him. Now we're like in India and the royal procession is approaching and we must be at our appointed place in time before the King arrives. One man calls our "Elephant" and doesn't even stop running as he hops up on a running elephant. He sways as he rides. We arrive at the stairs and are nearly too late. But protocol says that pushy women must go first. "Hurry! You first," says Jake. She just grins and refuses. "Now we're in trouble! If she won't go, we can't go and then the King will be upset!" I say, "Let me talk to her!" Jake says, "No, I'll take care of it." He pulls out his penis and twists it so that a hand rolled cigarette comes out of the end of his penis! He's going to sit and smoke it until he thinks of a solution. I am a little disgusted at the idea of putting it in his mouth as it will be a little slimy from the sperm! [BL] (299 words)

I'm watching TV and had seen the previews of coming events, when a man is with his family and suddenly the floor caves in and he falls down, straight down a tunnel-like thing for a long way. He can't breathe and I see his face all contorted in agony as he holds his breath almost past his endurance. I decide that's pretty awful stuff and scary, so I decide I don't want to watch this TV show. But as I start to turn it off, it comes on and I decide it's not too gruesome and I watch (sort of feeling like I watched that man being buried alive on TV in junior high). He lands in a big cavern under the city after deciding to go with the slide, because he was bored with his present ordinary family life. There's a crazy psychotic guy down there. He's been there for years and he's delighted to have company. At first he's suspicious, but then he likes the guy and wants to play. The guy thinks it would be interesting to hang out for a while, so he plays and they swing from ropes and climb things. The fallen guy sees a woman's image and mourns. He hopes she's a good woman and she and her husband are in love. It's rare these days. And then he misses his family who must be mourning his loss. Then the crazy guys shoots lots of arrows at a tree-like thing near him, narrowly missing him. The crazy guy laughs and laughs. The fallen guy goes and grabs the arrows and throws some down out of the cavern and breaks some. That makes the crazy guy angry. "What did you do that for?" he asks. Then the falling guy teases the crazy guy into a "can't catch me" game. They both sit on sharp holes like conical ant hills or ends of tree branches and laugh. They are naked and the crazy guy gets a hard-on and laughs and runs back to the knobby branch. He's excited by the dangerous undertones in the game. He wonders briefly if he's homosexual and decides he's not. Then the game stops. The falling guy is lonesome and decides to return to his family. He says goodbye and starts to climb up the subway/sewer-like tunnel ladder. This enrages the crazy guy who entices him back to his camp area and tells him he has to crawl into a cocoon device and the crazy guy will lock it up. The falling guy doesn't want to, but approaches it cautiously, saying "Do I hear a voice of someone you've already trapped there?" I worry he will go in there and can't believe it when he does! How stupid to voluntarily trap yourself. I wonder at his reasons and get the feeling that it's because the crazy guy has a gun, and if he refuses it would be certain death. At least as long as he's alive, there's hope for escape. So he gets in the cocoon like it's a cradleboard; his hands, arms and legs are bound inside. For days the crazy guy is cruel to him, sometimes feeding him, etc. The falling guy says in an embarrassed tone, "I've messed my dress and there's a couple of spots sorted with BM, can you clean me up?" The crazy guy laughs cruelly. The falling guy tries to hang his butt end over the cliff to defecate without messing on himself, but one slip and he'd fall. His balance is precarious. Then he struggles for the key and gets it in his mouth and accidentally swallows it. He grimaces and says, "I can't believe I did that!" Now they are both in trouble. Somehow the crazy guy tires of the game and thinks about moving on to another place under the city and getting other "playmates." It is possible the falling guy will be released and return to his loving family. (660 words)

I am driving to a church where I will be at a Native American ceremony. I drive backwards down a freeway against traffic in an attempt to turn around and go in the opposite direction at the last moment. Sharon and other Indian women see me arrive and come out to greet me. I walk down a path looking for a way back to the freeway, but only see a dirt path and then a driveway up to someone's nice house. I smile at Sharon and shrug my shoulders, deciding to go through with it after all, since I can't find a way out. As I walk into the community room, I ask her what I need to be doing to help. She says, "Tie 15,000 tobacco ties!" I say, surprised, "15,000?" and repeat that, shaking my head in wonder! I enter the room to see the tables and chairs all set up: square tables for four. I drive my wheelchair to the back of the room and move a chair out of my way by bulldozing with my wheelchair. An Indian boy comes up, one of several that had been running and playing on the steps when I arrived and look like Theresa's boys! He says to me I shouldn't move things around to suit myself like that. I say, "Oh well. I like to sit in the back where I can get out quick if I need to." I then look longingly at the front where I would be able to see the expensive things better. Then people come in and a couple of ugly old farts (businessmen) sit at my table. I'm cutting pies up into 8ths and wrapping them. They make negative comments about women's places. They are rusty, traditional men. Two of the worst decide they are attracted to me. I laugh and start singing a song about "just my luck!" This one likes me and then Mr. R comes up and says he likes me. I skip over to my apartment building to change clothes, singing this song, and I follow myself watching. I feel the possible threat of a man (crazy) attacking her/me but keep thinking, "No. that won't happen," and see a crazy man who avoids my eye contact, and I keep moving out of the building back toward the church.

Ginny gets a phone call from her young, nice lover. She has to decide between him and her husband. She looks for the phone. At first it looks like an elephant hitting his ear on a gong, but some man points to a big spoon and a dinner plate labeled "Plate" where she hits it with the spoon. The young man says he's coming to her. I ask her what she's going to do because here comes her husband. She's going to choose the young man, but is afraid to tell her crazy, dangerous husband.

Theresa is in my living room. She's kind of moved in with her kids. Someone drives an old beat up car to the curb and Theresa laughs and calls it "Old Paint." I am in wonder and thankful for her sense of humor. Then I see her kids have painted colorful marks all over my white walls. I am tired and realize I'll have to paint over the walls again. Those kids are like "wild Indians." Then Theresa says, "It's time to do the by-laws." I say, "OK, let's go back to the office." As I start to follow Theresa, a little baby girl gets cranky. She hangs on to me thinking I'm going to desert her again. I sooth her and say, "See, here's a comfy bed and some toys and I am here with you." It's a girl's bedroom. I then see another bedroom and I say, "I'll be right back." I go in there and look around. I am amazed that there is an entire, complete kitchen in this spacious nice bedroom. I say to Grandma Mildred, "You should see Aunt Esther's room with a complete kitchen." I compliment Aunt Esther. Then I remember the baby and I see Dovre at about 12 years old in the bathtub and I ask her to look in on the baby girl. I see she's OK and I ask Dovre to babysit her. (233 words)

James Mason and I are in the back seat of a car. I'm like Lolita. He's very sexually attracted to me and tells me to change my clothes. He kisses me and pinches my left nipple. I'm sexually excited. I say, "But people can see." An older woman is standing outside the car. He insists. I put on a pretty, brief pleated skirt with see-through lace seams and a turquoise velour top. He leans back in the car and says in a whisper in my ear, "Take off your panties." I feel sexually excited. I do so. I get out of the car, noticing I can see flashes of my legs through the lace. He is possessive and demanding and I love it. (123 words)

A young girl is in trouble. She's been isolated and abused. A baby and myself decide it is time (past time) to try to help her. So we're taking reports of her situation to other people. We are going down stairs and some of the stairs are missing. I carry the baby and carefully step over the gaping holes. A man says, "Oh, I forgot. Even adults need help sometimes." We get downstairs and see the axe the partying teens used to chop up the stairs. A military man named Harry is kind and wants to help me help the young girl. She's a handful. (105 words)

I am teaching an assertiveness class. The students are all spread out too far and then there's a glass partition between them and me. I knock on the glass and comment I don't like it being in the way. It makes it hard to teach. I then sigh and tell the students that I don't like assertiveness because I have to work harder, being assertive, and then hasten to add that, of course, it's best to be assertive and it's worth the extra energy. But I feel tired. I start teaching the nine-part statement. Then I'm in my bedroom. I see a photo of them side by side of twin beds. I'm seated on the end of the left bed with several children. Dovre is laying in the other bed with several kids. Then that goes and I am getting into the bed and Tom comes in (of dream group) and I'm naked and fat and grope for covers to cover me up. Tom sees me and is blushing bright red in embarrassment. (173 words)

I am in a new house -- cats and sparrows. A fire is burning, but it's not in the fireplace, it's in front of the fireplace. I watch the smoke coming up into the room (like the sage last night). Hasani and I move the fire back into the fireplace. I notice my jacket on the fire and pull it off, saying to Hasani, "Look! My jacket was on the fire." She frowns at me like I'm an idiot. "Oh, you put it there," I say. "Yes. It was wet," she said. I feel it and it is dry. I see a round dining table and three xmas trees, one tiny one on the mantel and two floor trees filled with xmas decorations. It is way past time to put the ornaments away and I decide to do that as I wait for Aunt Bridget to come visit. I think about asking Hasani to help but she's on her way out. I take off lots of cute fuzzy ornaments and take one out to the garbage can in the front of the garage. Bridget comes and follows me back into the house and picks up a complex ornament from the box and says, "What is it?" It has three figures sort of melted together; red color, possibly a devil figure.

I go into Aunt Elaine's house and get lost because she has remodeled, lots of kitchens one after the other. I come back to the original kitchen laughing and say I can't find the living room. They point and I go in. I see they have put color TV sets inside the two player pianos. There are four TV's on and nobody around to watch. I shake my head at such stupidity. (72 words)

Terence (my cousin) is dying. But before he can die, he must remember his memories. I am helping him. His eyes flutter and I think he's going, and then he wakes up and tells me more memories. He especially focuses on one weekend we shared together, something about the M City house. He says it was this room before it was remodeled and I look and realize it was the original room. He'd made a mistake. It was the old pool table room, only empty of furniture. [BL] (87 words)

I am sexually excited and want to make love, but no one is around. So I decide to wait for Howard to return. It's been a long time since I've made love to him and it will please him. I feel a little uncomfortable about such a gift because I may be opening myself up to more sexual advances from him than I'll want. So I sit and wait. [BL] (69 words)

I am showing a story book to someone and explaining that even before you start reading the book, the story is there in the symbols. I show them the cover and I see a night starry sky -- expansive earth and a hint of a person and I say, "See, here is a night sky, symbolizing intuition and the unknown. Here is Mother Earth, solid, foundation. Here is a person, etc. Then I turn the page and see animals: a horse (steady friendship), a rabbit (sweet and playful but loud out toward the end, tricky), etc. [BL] (96 words)

Now I'm an employee late to work and come in through rows of people (like at school). Someone says I've got a call for lesson #10. I go to the phone with my small daughter observing. I put on an electric guitar and ask them to play their lesson. The woman's voice says she'd rather not, she's already past that lesson and it's boring. I sympathize and say, "Just play me a scale and then we can double up on the lessons to go faster if you like." She'd like. She plays scales on a piano and makes one l/2 note mistake and corrects it. Now I'm called over to another section where I hold up a game card with a clock on it. It's part of a board game our company makes. I say, "Guess how much it costs to make this? 2 cents." And then I think it's better if they come up with the answer and I call on one who expounds at length and never gets to the point, and I regret giving them this chance to speak. Then we notice the clock is a simple brad poked through a cardboard and we try to see if the hands go around while the cardboard is turned in a circle, but we can't keep our eyes on it to decide.

Jake is embarrassed for me and asks if I'm not embarrassed because I was fired. I say no, because I wasn't fired. It wasn't a real mistake. It was a paper and pencil mistake at the bank. Maybe I did send it in just a little late, but that's not a mistake. [BL] (52 words)

An art teacher is preparing a class lecture and is showing art slides or film strips but things don't seem to be working. I am sympathetic because I like him and want things to go well. His projector flies way up high and is up against the wall. He shrugs his shoulders and smiles like, "Oh, well, what can you do?" I see a swimming pool and realize the opportunity to relax and swim has always been there, but I don't take advantage of it. So I swim and go for a nice leisurely walk. (95 words)

Don Johnson is very attracted to me and vice versa, but he's angry at me because I'm teasing him by acting like I don't care about him and walking away. I walk down the stairs laughing. He follows me and taunts me in an angry voice. He then leaves and shuts the door. Then he says, "I love you." I hear him through the door and I say, "I love you" back. He then opens the door and we hug and kiss. Now he's Dovre and he/she says she's going to get married and won't tell me to whom. I smile and say, "You don't have to tell me, I know. It's Bob, because I already saw the future (like already saw the movie)." She sneers and says, "A lot you know! It's not Bob." I am surprised and ask, "Then are these altered realities?" She smiles and says yes. "Then, I don't have to marry Howard again?" I ask, and realize I don't. So I say to Howard, "Sorry. Maybe some other time," and leave. He shrugs and goes off to wait.

I'm doing my newsletter. It's the last issue. I am waiting for two women from Disabilities Coalition to bring back the near final draft. There is room for one more article. A chubby male student comes in late and I say, "You can do the article." The women bring in the paper. I go to look at it, saying, "You're late; I thought you'd never get here." We are in a tiny bathroom and I say, "I wish there was more room here." We could finish the paper here, but we go down the narrow hall to the larger room. Maria has two boxes and I think it's full of letters to the newsletter. I say "Darn! Now that we've finished, we get response," but then I see it's mostly full of foodstuff and boxes of envelopes, so it's OK. The chubby student comes and says a girl in a wheelchair student just left, so we step to the huge plate glass window to wave goodbye. She's on a boat on a huge river just outside the window. The river is higher than usual and muddy. I see objects floating in it. The boats are all buses and pickup trucks. I see a school bus that suddenly sinks. I am concerned and ask, "Are there any people on board?" I then see people opening windows and an older woman holding her breath. They get out OK sputtering. I don't have to rescue them, though I am forced to do so. Another school bus goes by safely. (256 words)

I'm a sexy dancer. I dance through a crowd of me and see another professional dancer (10 cents a dance type) across the room. She's seated, resting, and I decide to do so also. A black athletic man comes over and talks. He tells me about how he'd have to walk home after ball practice. His coach wouldn't let him take the school bus. I sympathize and say nicely, "Well, you get good exercise, eh?" A man is watching me, interested. I write in my journal about what has happened. I comment that when I came through the crowd, I saw all kinds of men -- short, tall, fat, thin. Each one was different. I say, "And yet, each one so similar." I dance "dirty dancing" with men.

I go through a huge store to the back room. I'm tired and lie down on a bed. Suddenly I wake up to discover John (a man I work with) has crawled into bed with me, and he's naked. I pull the covers up around me and say, "What are you doing?" He's shy but insistent. He wants to make love, to get closer to me. He tries to kiss me. I am annoyed. I certainly don't want to make love to this wimp; what nerve! I say, "No. We can't. I'm your supervisor and it isn't ethical." I then think he'll be hurt, so I say, "I admire your courage to get naked and come here asking, but I don't want this." Just then through an open window I see people leaning out of their windows in the hotel across the street yelling, "Happy New Year" and blowing horns. I look at the clock and, sure enough, it's a few minutes past 12. [BL] (164 words)

I am a teenager and some guy is joining us, but I don't trust him. Our teacher, Gary, calls us together and asks us, "What do you think of this new guy? Does he seem a little sleazy or not "true" to you?" "Yeah!" we agreed. I say, "He doesn't feel right, like he lies." "Yeah," says Gary. "Well, what if I just flat out say, 'No booze or drugs'? That would take care of the scotch problem right there. It's tough, but real." We agreed. Paulina says, "But he might have a problem getting back in with his friends. If he's a flirt, then he won't fit in any more." I think it's interesting that a lesbian is concerned that a drunk be able to continue his noisy, flirty, sexist ways. I disagree and start talking about if his attitude is OK, he can fit in and still have fun even if he's off the booze and drugs. As I'm talking, suddenly little lights zip up to me and surround me. I look up at Gary startled. I realize these are aliens that are taking me away, and as I start rising (still in cross-legged, seated position), I yell, "Gary!" And then I yell, Goodbye!" I see them all staring at me in astonishment and sadness. I feel a little scared and sad as I see the tree as I rise up and up. (I suddenly wake up relieved I wasn't disappearing into the cosmos.)

I go to a photography class and am putting my lens into the camera. It appears to be a bit crooked, but then it clicks in right. The teacher gives instructions and there are diagrams and such on the board. I go to the ladies' room and come back. I have to put my bra back on. So I step behind an easel in the back of the class. Everyone turns and tries to see as I struggle. The straps get twisted and it's hard to do without exposing myself. Finally I do it, but I'm angry at the teacher (now a law class). I raise my hand and tell her off very directly and clearly. l. The bathroom was too crowded. 2. The rule that says you must put your bra on even if people watch is inhumane ( and there was a 3rd reason). The class was very impressed that I stood up so bravely to the teacher (a woman) and, in fact, talked like a professional lawyer even though I'm in a class to learn to be a lawyer. I kind of enjoyed the experience. I didn't get angry. I was clear and articulate. Then later she starts talking and I raise my hand to answer a question. She ignores me and finally I stand up and go right up to the front of the class, right in her face. She has to call on me. She doesn't like it. (243 words)

He says, "That you are going to die today before 7:00." I am startled and look at the boy. He nods and says, "Yes. You are going to die." I am afraid and I say, "Will it hurt or be bad?" He says, "No. You will go very quickly. It won't be bad or painful." I say, "Then take me now. Let's get it over with." The winds kick up in the trees and a wavy feeling comes over me and then I'm dead, only heaven seems to be the same room I was in before I died. I see God. She's a woman, somewhat distracted. I then look out the windows at the end of the room and see a driveway with a car in it. I say, "Is daddy ever coming home?" God says, "Yes, soon." Then a man comes in the room. He's a baseball guy that gambles. God gets nervous and fiddles with her blouse button. The boy gets very nervous at the idea of God being nervous. God reassures him. She says, "It's OK. Just a little excess suppressed sexual energy," and then takes care of the baseball guy easily. (233 words)

They dawdle along and we go down lots of steps and come to a crossroads. I don't know which way to go. I see Ellie seated dejectedly on a step. She says, "It's too late anyway.

H and I go into a restaurant. Two comedians are doing their act. The first one did a joke in Latin and Hasani got it and the second joke was in Spanish and I got it. They weren't very good jokes. He looks sadly at Hasani and says, "I think you misunderstood." We had been feeling pretty good about our ability to get the jokes even in other languages. Then, the second comedian comes on and his jokes are terrible. We pay and leave to go find Dwight and Arvonne. We go downstairs, past the two comedians who are having an after-the-show chat with drinks. We get in an elevator, and even as we start to go, we can hear their conversation. I realize we are going sideways and slightly uphill. There is no ceiling and I bend a little, afraid my head might be exposed and I'll get hurt. We return from whence we came, having gone through a huge basement room where two girls chased an older woman. Now we are being haunted by the spirits of the second comedian. It's in the curtain, bumping around. I'm not very afraid and I say, "Come on then. Teach me." He becomes visible. He has a bony face, long prominent teeth, and bulging eyes. He cracks a couple of rim shot jokes. I carefully look at the structure of the jokes. Then someone says, "Richard," and he says, "Nixon," and continues with the jokes. He then says, "teamster," and waits for me to finish the joke. I frantically think (like Sally Field in Punchline movie) and then come out with, "Teamsters are a little lost without their huskies." He laughs and says, "Not bad, but it needs work." I laugh, surprised I could make a joke. He then asks which set of jokes he did that I like best. I say, "The second set." "Oh, song jokes. I didn't think any were all that good." An older woman is sitting there playing cards. A young girl knocks on the door. She's bringing the other comedian. She says, "Is there anyone in there who will be scared? I want to be scary." (361 words)

He starts to walk across the street and then gets on all fours to imitate a baby crawling. He's in diapers. It's a little cute comedy skit to amaze me. I laugh.

He's a red neck type. They circle around my bench, stop and get out. I get up and Doug and I walk to a square outdoor cafe table. Lydia follows.

Dovre and I are at the movies. Tyler hands me a letter he wrote me. It is long and sweet, emotional. He starts by describing our first day together at work. "We were on a tall hill and looked over the scene," he began. I was touched and felt close to him. A woman is giving frothy lemon meringue pie pieces out to starving poor people. I think she is harming them, giving them something for nothing, teaching them to beg, and it's not nutritious. She's upset with me for not giving pies out. We talk back and forth. Then she mumbles, "Some people aren't very giving." "Some women in particular," Dylan smiles because he sees I've got the hint and I'm filling with righteous anger and am about to tell her what for. I sit up and say, "What did you say? Could you repeat that?" She does. I say, "I understand what you're really saying and I want you to know some people give in different ways. Some people answer the telephone at 3:00 a.m. and listen to the other person's fears and pain." I guess I told her! (191 words)

I'm in a foreign country, Jamaica or India, and I hear a man say, "Oh Dear! This is terrible. I saw a sign and now I must go home and tell my wife and she must kill herself and then I won't get any dinner." I laugh at his odd religion. I am meeting an older woman friend and I have a gift for her. She has a man she wants to introduce to me. He follows along behind us. I am all involved in getting the gift from the sack I'm carrying and pay no attention. He's attracted and watches me. It's sort of like we're both destined to meet and have relationship but we haven't noticed each other yet. I go to the library, walking through the streets thinking, "I can write a story about a country I've never been in! I can do it." I go in the library to reserve a room to do my research. The librarian leaves, is busy. I call up and reserve a room for Sunday, very pleased with myself because the librarian said there weren't any available. I start to write it into her reservation book and realize I'll get in trouble, so I wait until she returns and fess up to using her phone, etc. She asks me what I called and I realize I'd called a library in another city (New York maybe), so I'm out of luck. I feel very frustrated and defeated. The man is leaving a group of his friends and is about to enter the room I'm in and we will meet. (267 words)

I have a camera that looks like Valerie's tape player. I pour grape juice in it to make it work better.

Now I am holding a "sister," a young girl/woman, in my arms and I am very intense and upset. I must help her and the only way is to repeat over and over, "I believe in you, Sharon" no matter what she says. I'm trying to help her overcome sexual molestation trauma and I explain to Arvonne we have to help her build trust, so no matter what awful thing she says, we accept it and love her anyway. Arvonne frowns and won't cooperate. I tell her angrily she's a bad woman and a lousy psychologist! I pace, saying, "I believe in you, Sharon" over and over. She mumbled, "Owaha, Hawaii," and, "I don't go to San Salvador." This is considered progress. (167 words)

I'm with some teens and we're in a deserted, scary house. I have a walkie-talkie and find dead and bloody bodies that zoo animals have come in and marauded. A lion runs toward us up the stairs and we run into a room and shut the door. It won't lock, so we all lean against it, fighting the terrible force of the lion clawing through the door. We lock it precariously and I yell, "Is there another door?" We find one and go out into another hall and see a trap door up in the ceiling. We crawl up there and hide. Suddenly I'm aware of spooks and spirits, a huge black-blue tarantula spider and a half eaten away corpse lurking behind us. Trapped between a raging lion and the scary spirits, I call out on my radio, "We're in this deserted house; come get us." Men with rifles come in and kill the lion and we escape.

A "Donald Trump" guy takes a special super fighter jet to fly an Arab princess where she needs to go. I'm surprised the government let him get away with that! We land. There is a lake. I think I escape and run for the lake. I slide down a talus slope and just as I get to the water, Donald's body floats out of a cave. He's on his back. His eyes flutter open. I thought he was dead. I was safe, but no. He lives. The first thing I saw was his huge, strong hand. So I run for the place and get in. He runs after me, yelling, "Wait. There's something you need to know before you fly." I figure it's a trick, and get in and fly away. It's hard because the jet is so complex. (139 words)

A woman and I live together. She might be a daughter. She has a Chicano lover and she's afraid of him. He comes in drunk and has a gun that he threatens to shoot us with. I yell and grab the gun. He gets very angry and hits me and is going to badly beat me up. I dare him to try, but am inwardly afraid. I call him names. The daughter is a total wimp and angry at me for fighting back. I made him leave. I bring the gun in a lake. She says I should have to pay for it since I made it go away. I refuse and leave. He's following me and means me harm. I head for the M City house and go to the front door, hoping my father is around to help protect me. I see he is and I slam the door shut after I get in the living room. I yell, "Call the police!" As I lock the door. "Dad," who looks like Grandpa Mildred, can't find the number. "911," I yell. He tries, but is unsuccessful. The guy gets in and Dad doesn't do anything. Now the scene changes and he and my "daughter" have taken the deed to my place and are using it for their own. He's planted corn in my yard. I say to him, "I know what you've done. It's illegal and I can get a lawyer and get back my land anytime I want." He knows that, so he tries to be nice to me. I hold it over his head. If he doesn't "take care of me right," I yank the farm out from under him. I don't trust him. I'm waiting for him to screw up. (294 words)

[I fell back to sleep early in morning.] I had three minutes to get to school and I was running up a graveled path and across a lawn and missed the school building and went on into bushes where an older child, Charla, was crying. Then I realized I was dreaming and suggested to myself I go up and find the creative healing source. I felt waves of energy and I easily flew up through a ceiling and up into space and then saw lots of tan-colored spots that were my DNA. I thought of maybe coming out of the trance and encouraged myself to stay with it. (100 words)

Coming to an old poverty-struck town to teach. We find the address and no one's there. So I go to the door and call, "I'm here. It's time." Little munchkin type critters come in. My associate (Mike Douglas) looks out at all of these "disabled" critters and looks at me. I smile at his discomfort. He asks if they need high school or grade school instruction. They say grade school. He says, "Well, that's me." I then take over as I'm more at ease and tell them I have arthritis and my vocal cords are deformed and I can't talk over them. They cooperate and I thank them for showing me respect. (112 words)

Tom (Susan's husband) and Mabel tell me they got married today and I cry. I'm hurt because they didn't tell me before so I could come to the wedding. They said if they told me and then some others, then soon too many people would come or feelings would get hurt. I say, "I should have realized when you told me you got your marriage license yesterday." (67 words)

Jake is very depressed; he is lying down and thinking of suicide. I come up to him and he says, "A part of me died last February." I say, "At least you have your health! I don't even have that." I then explain to him how he needs to make changes so his relationships with Valerie can continue. I put my hands together with the fingers interlaced and say their relationship is like that. He is good at lots of things, but terrible at social and relationship stuff and Valerie is the opposite. (93 words)

I'm with a group of people. Each of us lives in a carved-out cave area. A younger brother of Bob Lacote lives opposite me. A wall separates us. A bossy "mother" puts paneling (like in my office) over the lovely natural obsidian wall. I am appalled. The other brother "Bob" and I are attracted. When he visits his younger brother's cave, I can hear every word he says, and when I talk on the phone he hears me. That's how we communicate with each other. (85 words)

Susan S. and Tom are around. The phone rings and I answer it. It is the media interested in Mobility International, and I'm a little disappointed because I hoped they were interested in my stuff. I hand the phone over to Susie. It turns out they ask me to go somewhere and talk, and she refuses for me because she thinks I've done too much and will get tired and ill. I give her a lecture, surprised that she of all people didn't know better. "I make that decision. Not you. Probably I'll come to the same decision but I have the right to decide. Don't decide for me." She is embarrassed and agrees. And now I'm flying. The vehicle I'm on is sort of a flattened wheelchair. It runs on air and is slowly running out, like a balloon. I hope I have enough. I fly through a boy's dorm and down the side of a tall building. I finally run out and am concerned how I'll manage because I can't walk well or far. An "India" man comes up and makes me a special tortilla, white and round with # cross hatch embossed marks on it. I fold it up and eat it. It's like peyote only it makes me feel peaceful and I can now move effortlessly. (220 words)

Bonnie, Mateo, a baby girl and I are in an old living room. Mateo is playing rough and I tell him to get down. I'm trying to coax the baby girl to my lap. Bonnie says, "How come there are always killer dogs around?" I say, "There aren't any around here. Oh maybe up the street," and then I laugh because I was thinking of South H. Street, not A. Street. Three big guys and a snarling dog come to the door and walk right in and stand inside the door. I pick up the baby girl and say to them, "What do you want?" They hem and haw and say, "Do you have any records?" (musical ones). I say, "No, I don't, none to give anyway." They smirk and leave. I get up and go to the door, carrying the baby. It's dark and cloudy out there and ominous. Snarling dogs are up and down the street. Snarling squirrels try to bite at me through the old, nasty screen door. Those men are lounging on my lawn, waiting. I say, "I'm not afraid. I know what to do." I shut the door and lock it and look hurriedly for other doors to lock. I see a long closed-in hall (tunnel like) and refuse to walk through it, too scary. I go upstairs and I see an unlocked door and hear them opening it. I tiptoe up the attic stairs, stepping over clothes and games. I hear them tiptoeing behind me. I am scared. I see a pad and crawl under it and under a second layer and I curl up, waiting and hoping they don't find me. They paw around the pad but don't unearth the second layer. They are standing very close to me. I can hardly breathe. (300 words)

I'm in the back seat of a car telling a woman in the front seat what my father does for a living. I sit in different positions like a teen on the phone, including up-side-down. I say he's a paleontologist now and even has a plant fossil named after him, "S.i." I comment that he used to be a musician, or rather a music teacher. I see a plant that I call an S.i. (named after me). It is a primitive, a green stalk with nodules for roots. It is easily plucked from the ground (like the plant at the forest camp). I see it only grows in clumps at the end of benches (like picnic table benches). Now I'm getting into a convertible car. I have boots on -- black, lace up boots (not sexy, but interesting). It has a lavaliere mike on it and I say, "I'm wired for sound." I get in the back seat, seated up on the top like a prom queen. There's a baby girl (2 years) in the corner of the back seat with me. My father is driving. He gives me a glass of champagne and I comment (or think), "It's a good thing I'm not in the front seat with Dad. People could get the 'wrong' idea about a sexual relationship." There's a black cover top over the back seat that I'm seated on. (233 words)

I'm in a small room that has dirt and debris and bugs in it. I see a tiny (Alice in Wonderland) door and, curious, I open it. I see an ugly man there and say, "Uh oh, guess I shouldn't have opened the door." I shut it quickly. I decide I don't want this room to be so bad, so I marshal my forces and change things. (I am aware I'm dreaming) and command the bugs to straighten things up. They march around in lines and I walk carefully so as not to smash any of them. I am repelled by them and grateful to them. They do miraculous work. In fact it is lovely and has opened up into more rooms, including the room the man had been in. I go down a hallway toward the bedrooms. I see video games. Then I see a 3-D video behind glass of real people enacting ordinary human activities. I'm like a voyager watching them. I feel sad that I'm reduced to such a lowly act. I see sexual activity and feel an orgasm. [BL] (182 words)

There is an invasion and I see the air filled with planes. One comes down and lands on my arm, only it's not a plane now but a metallic butterfly-like machine. It says, "What is your name?" I know I've been captured and must answer. I say, "B. J. M." Then a huge creature in black, tall and very muscular comes over. He's a huge soldier. He says, "Barb Sanders?" I say, "Yes." He says, "Come with me." I follow him. He kind of looks like Terence (cousin). I'm taken to a resort hotel-like place. Darryl is there. We escape and are in the woods. We start to make love and I love it. "Oh good," I say, "I get to feel your sexy kisses again." He performs oral sex and I say, embarrassed, "What are you doing?" I repeat that several times and then as we are nearing a climax, two girls come over (young women). They are the enemy also and I realize we are still too close to the hotel and not really deep in the woods. We run fast and get in my van and drive (I drive) fast, only now we're on open plains and the enemy headquarters are right near by. I say, "We've got to find cover in the trees," and I drive toward the trees, but I end up driving in a shallow river and then it's deep and we are floating. I paddle for land to discover it's a line of floating furniture -- wood, kitchen chairs, then tables, then cribs and bedroom sets, from tiny to large. (Earlier there was a strange bathroom where I had to squat down on a funnel-like shape where I found a note from Darryl suggesting we meet. I had come out of the bathroom, which had two doors, one unlatched saying, "Yes, yes, yes," very happily. (312 words)

I'm in a hospital bed, sleeping. I'd had seizures or something and they had me under observation. I really was OK and this was an expensive way to make sure. A man who really did have seizures comes over to me and takes a bottle of wine from my bedside table. I tell him to put it back. The doctors are talking about me. I get up to examine lots of my old belongings I'd packed up long ago and sent to England. They are out on a counter top and taking up lots of room. I go through the stuff and see magazines and amber beads I'd like to take back with me. I realize I'd taken up too much room with my junk and wonder if other people need this area and think about packing it back up and taking it back to America. (146 words)

I build a tiny room behind another room to hide in. Capt. Kirk and Spock are looking for me. They are in their private office and Capt. K sees a seam on the wall that is part of my hidden room. He says to Spock, "This room seems different, smaller, and I don't remember that seam there." I realize then they'd found me. I feel caught. Kirk says, "Do you think she knows we know?" Spock says, "She knew the moment you knew. Ann is very smart, as smart as you." They leave the room to give me some private time. (101 words)

Four women are all dressed alike, in a yellow/gold satin dress with black lace. They are dance hall hostesses. I am one and walk down the stairs. Then I'm a kid and I'm in trouble with the other kids because I paid out tutors too much money. They say, "Didn't you know they already make over 90 cents an hour?" I'm a little embarrassed. I lay on a bed and see a black and white kitten chasing a mouse. "That's just a toy mouse, right?" I ask and see that it is. I am relieved and reach down and pet them and play with them. I tease, "You really are mousers! You little mouse, you." I say it like it's not really true they are mousers. (126 words)

Cary Grant is a spy. He comes to "my house," which is small. The bedroom is in a loft and the two children's beds are in the same room as mine. The bedspreads are all matching. There are a baby girl and a two year old boy. He's a roomer. I go outside and he and I walk down the beach. He says, "We'd better practice cuddling and kissing so we'll look like husband and wife." We do and it's so nice I start to fall in love with him. I hold him to me close and he hugs back. He says with regret, "This usually happens. It will pass." I feel sad. Then I hear music, a woman singing gospel, and we walk over there. Then I look down a hall and see a bad guy and I say, "Quick, look, so you'll know what he looks like too." He looks, red shirt. So I see two doors and I say, "It's a conference of some kind." I go to pretend I'm a member to find out more information. A fat woman, a nurse, comes over to me and I start asking questions. Come to find out, they sell babies form the hospital to childless women, so I pretend I want a baby. She gives me a slip of paper like a Visa slip. It says, "Pick up the baby at the hospital." I ask her name and phone and she gets suspicious. (244 words)

I wake up and put on my necklace which has lots of charms of animals on it, only someone from the group, for the second time, has waxed some of the animals so they are stuck to a cardboard. This time there are three little note cards and I pick them off so I can get clues to who did this. One card said, "Are you surprised and angry?" I went out and saw Dylan and I ask outraged, "Why did they do this to me?" I saw the group (like Mobility International) and felt that they didn't like me and were being mean. I didn't understand why. I was trying to be a good facilitator. So I go talk to some people, some tourists, and then I realize the whole group had left early. We were to get on the airplane for the Soviet Union at l:30 and Rita, the other leader (only from Columbia), had set up the time to l:00 and didn't tell me, deliberately. I rush back to get my baby and her high chair and I grouse angrily that at least they'd have helped me put that in baggage. I show my tickets and they rush me to the "late passenger" doors (wooden and homemade). I get on the place and angrily look into each seat for Rita. Everyone is subdued and watching me because I'm so angry. At the back of the plane I find her, hiding. I grab her shoulders and shake her, saying, "Why are you doing this?" She said she didn't like my jokes and I talk too much. I said, "That's part of my job to be a good facilitator." She said nobody like it. I felt rejected. Later, it's a dance and no one asks me to dance. Finally someone pulls me out for a round dance where you go in a circle dancing with all the men, only somehow all I got to dance with were older, ugly women and one very tall man with his bride in his arms. He gave me curt directions on how I should dance. It was a romantic song (Endless Love or something) and I was to kiss his hand just so. I felt silly because he'd hand me her hand. So then my next partner was a bossy woman who took the lead and danced us directly in front of the seating for President Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Jim Weaver and Joe Kennedy in a manual wheelchair. Joe invites me to join them, looking at my disabled leg. Jack Kennedy says, "Lee Oswald was OK." I raise an eyebrow and say, "The Lee Oswald. The one that killed you?" He acknowledged that I had clearly seen through his conversation. Then I asked Joe if he played wheelchair basketball. He said he did. I said in E City (state) they've got a good team. I'm not on it. I dance in my wheelchair. Jim Weaver repeats "E City (state)." (496 words)

I'm in a bathtub and draining the water. I stand up, being careful not to slip on the soap bars. I step into a second tub of cool water and rinse. I then dry off and get into a bathrobe. I hear a knock at the door. I wonder if I should ask, "Who is it?" before I open it. It might be a bad person. I don't ask, and it is Bonnie. I say, "Come in, but as you can see, all my furniture is gone. I'm moving." [BL] (89 words)

I'm moving and tell people not to forget this or that. My paintings on the wall, my piano bench (a bar stool with a flanged-flared bowl seat like lilac bowl of 4th grade flower show). I say, "I want to look around before we go to make sure nothing important is left." A muscular man I called Dad says, "OK," and goes outside. I go to the porch and call out, "Wait. We've packed the steps, we can't get down." He gets a motorcycle and says wait, he'll come around inside and get me and we'll jump the porch to get off. I yell at him, "No. It's not necessary. I can go inside and walk down the basement steps." He goes ahead and then crashes and is paralyzed badly. His face is in shock. I start to feel guilty that this was all for me and then realize he did it to himself. (154 words)

There had been a massacre down river and I got into a canoe with another woman and two Indian men. We paddled to the scene where it happened. We did a good job of synchronized paddling. As we looked over the scene, I realized a storm was brewing and we needed to leave soon. I had to pray first. So I saw a cord coming down from the ceiling and I could have been less diligent and started my prayers at mid point but no, I moved my hands to hold the very top section and prayed for my father, then I moved my hands to the next section and prayed for my mother, and so on down until at the last, I prayed for me. After this, the male Indian gave each of us girls a scorpion which we placed on our heads and looked like crocheted head piece. Then we each got our feathers, which we put in our braid (we are Indian). I felt proud. Earning our feather was a brave and good thing. He praised us. Then I saw the waters quite rough from the storm and we paddled out. (194 words)

I keep on deliberately approaching him and insulting him. There is a direct confrontation. He and I fight. Another man joins in. I pinch their balls and punch and kick. They hit me a lot too.

I was surprised he could believe that. (77 words)

I am fighting a man. He's shooting at me with a pistol. If I stand still, he misses me. I am very angry at him, and I stand over him with a huge knife and want to kill him. It's all I can do not to kill him, but I force myself to calm down. After this ordeal I lay down and a man is there. I ask him if we can hug. He cuddles his head in my shoulder and I lay there with my arms around him like he's my child, only it was me that needed the comfort. Then he's Howard and he's sexually aroused and wants to make love. I refuse him and then say, "It's not sex that is the problem, it's that I never even wanted to kiss you the first time. I didn't even like that." I hoped I didn't hurt his feelings. I remembered he owed me $116.00 (156 words)

Dolores M is the clerk in the fabric store. I want to make a nightgown. She says, "OK, but if you buy that material, you must also buy this material to make six pairs of socks." I don't like the sock material; it's a flowered print cotton with ruffles. She says, "You don't actually have to make the socks, you just have to buy the material." So I do. Then I see a crowd on a lawn in front of my bedroom. Two comedians are doing their routine. One's white and the other black (Bill Cosby). I go around the crowd to get a better look and I see two wheelchair guys being interviewed by the TV media about accessibility. Then two orange-haired black kids come over to Bill while he's working and want him to take them to the store. He stage whispers, "Can't you see I'm working? Go ask your mother." He's their father.

Millie has come to visit me. I ask how many days will she stay. She says, "Only one night and two days." I am disappointed. I say, "We could do this or that." She just wants to hang out looking out the window. She says, "Do you see the dinosaur?" A hillside looks like the shape of a dinosaur. I say, "Look at that one. It looks like an iguana or Gila monsters. She says she can only stay a short time because her garden is growing fast now and she never needs to tend it. We go outside to see the garden. She points out row after row of plants and names each one. I say, confused, "Did you bring your garden here?" She says, "No, I know I don't have a garden." We decide it belongs to the big farm owner (like Breeden Brothers). (146 words)

Then the soldier comes out and says, "Now I want a woman." He grabs me and takes me in there. I do not cry out or fight. When he's done he chains me to another "brave one," a man. Each of our arms are chained to a carton of 18 eggs. (83 words)

Lydia and I are talking. My father calls me over to show me something that vibrates under a floor. I see a broken piece in the floor and a hole. I say, "Whatever it was came through here." I hoped it wasn't scary aliens. My mother is calling my father from a distance. Her voice is harsh and bossy. I feel sorry for my father. Lydia and I walk outside. She says, "You need to go where the good writers are." I say, "Where?" She says, "Maybe with Howard." I laugh. She says, "No really. Maybe the Native Americans." I say, "They aren't writers."

I'm in a bedroom sand I'm a little scared. There are "entities" in there. Ernie and Ginny are there too. I leave the room to go take a bath. I leap out of bed very healthily. I say, "Maybe I should stay. They also healed me." I take the bath and go back to that bedroom, still a little nervous but needing the good healing energy. I get in bed. Ernie curls up with me. He is gentle and loving and I realize this is friendship, not sexual. I relax in his embrace. (93 words)

I'm in the living room of the Sheridan house. A TV says, "Tonight the town will go to the play and enjoy themselves, a tradition begun by the Sanders years ago. And I am surprised and say to someone, "You mean that when we had pre-play parties and went with our friends to the play, we created a tradition and everyone remembers us?" "Yep," agrees someone. Then I'm in a 1950's formal. The door bell rings, guests arrive. It's a reunion. I act as hostess and welcome my parents' now old friends and take them into the piano room and offer them refreshments. I am a charming hostess. I welcome Mrs. Cinquint, an old school teacher. I hug her and say, "I remember you! I was a small child." She admires how I've grown up. Another family friend and her family comes to the door. She sits on the huge, empty porch floor with her presents. She says to my mother, "I brought you presents, but I can't stay, so let's open them here. The room's empty except for a tiny Christmas tree and a swing set her kids are playing on. My father calls to me to attend the guests. I go into the piano room and mingle. I approach two guys in tuxedos. I say, "What can I bring you?" I am aware of a young, good-looking man watching me, enjoying me. One guy says, "I want a this ___________," a name of a stomach medicine. I laugh and say, "OK, coming up." The next guy, who I realize is gay, asks for some fingernail polish. He says, "I heard you don't wear any." I smile and say, "It's true. I don't own any." He says, "But what if you get a run in your stockings." I say, "I don't wear stockings." This is pleasantly arousing to the young man watching. I walk past where he's seated in an overstuffed armchair and talk with a woman who is attempting to compose a poem with an old silly song. As I tease her, the young man pulls my leg until I fall into his lap. We laugh and tease about the song, and then he picks me up and we go to a corner in the room and sit. He's cuddling me and it is very nice. I say, "I must get back to my guests," but he won't let me and I don't struggle very hard. I like where I am. (413 words)

I am the only English boy in a Chinese school. They don't like me at all. They are all seated at long tables in rows. I must sit alone at a school desk. I had befriended a Chinese girl who wanted me to sit with her, but the teacher hated me and made me sit alone. So when she wasn't looking, I'd sneak between the tables back to my desk.

Thousands of black Africans in native costumes are attacking. One has a gun and we shoot him and he shoots us. He laughs and says, "We can't be killed and our numbers are endless." I realize he's right and there's only one hope. Now I have a Catholic priest's frock on and I play a peace hymn on an out-of-tune organ/piano. I play it loud, hoping to get others to sing and then the killing will stop. (77 words)

I'm in some kind of a hotel and I'm looking for the elevator. I find it. Some other people crowd into another elevator that doesn't look right. As it goes up, the sides fold down on them like a crushed box. They start screaming. I rush over and push the down button and they tumble out. I point to the sign that says "Danger, Freight elevators" and say to the manager that it needs to be more clear. It really is written in obscure words and I tell her, "And even I, who am quite literate, would have trouble understanding the sign. (102 words)

Now I'm driving home up a freeway. I'm sort of Kate Hepburn. We see a troop of entertainers and pull over. They come over and are belligerent. We try to escape. They laugh and say they aren't legal in this state but they are just over the Delaware border. We drive away and realize we're going the wrong way, so we turn and drive quickly past them again, sticking out our tongues and jeering, feeling safe they can't catch us. We pull into a hotel that has a parking garage so they won't see our car, but as we look out our room windows we see them pull in. We lock the door. Our room is furnished with two bare mattresses. They pound on the door and we hide, hoping they'd go away. They do and then the hinge side of the door pops free and open. We hold it closed, hoping they don't return. (155 words)

I'm in a bus and a facilitator of a group like Mobility International. One of the guys gets outside the bus and clings to the outside as we are driving fast down the road! I insist that he come back inside. He refuses. It's a power struggle. I point out he could be in danger. He points out he's just fine. I call up to the driver, "Stop the bus. We won't go until you come in." He comes in, upset with me. I go up front to explain to the driver and Susie what happened. We continue the journey, but I keep having those kinds of standoffs with other group members. They are not cooperating and I'm getting tired of having to keep them in line. (127 words)

I'm a river animal of some sort and I'm lazily paddling in my nice creek. I see fish swimming, my dinner later on. I smile, floating on my back and feeling good about my nice river. I get out and explore a commercial restaurant kitchen. I waddle up some stairs and see a double swinging glass door to the lobby. I am tempted to go through, but remember that the last time I did that I couldn't find my way back, so I return to my creek. Kitchen people comment on me as I pass, "Did you see that? Wasn't it cute?" "Someone should pick it up." "Not me!" I see three or four more poodle dogs in a side alcove. A man says, "They're mine. I'm waiting for the other sexed dog to arrive." I see someone leading a female poodle toward them and am glad I'm not here with three or four sexual males awaiting her. (158 words)

I'm in a movie on a huge floating dock. It's a small part and I'm almost through, kind of routine stuff. Suddenly a huge whale breezes through and I am catapulted around and thrown into the water with the whale. He wants to play. He likes me, but I am terrified because I don't know if he's going to eat me or accidentally drown me or what. The water is nearly black and dark. I slide under and am afraid, and then I find a place to crawl back up on the dock. Someone else is out in the water and I am relieved to be "safe." The whale seems to want only me. He has a crush on me. (120 words)

I decide to do the dishes. There's just a few left to do. I start in and it feels nice to be cleaning up a job that's been sitting around for a while, and then I notice I'm going to be late! So I hurry away to change. I wear black and red. I see another woman next to me and realize with surprise that she and I are transfusing our blood to each other through tubes hooked into our legs. I hadn't felt them put in the needle. After that's all over, I get ready to go to a very fancy party, at a spiffy uptown address. At the last moment I pick up a red ribbon for my hair. It's very ornate, with black on one side, red on the other and becomes a mask for my face. All the fragile curly cues are attached to a center of plastic like a false fingernail that I glue to my nose. I look very beautiful. As I walk out people stop and stare at my beauty. A huge crowd is outside seated on benches. I see a line of women in maroon shirts and notice it clashes with my red. Then I see a young Clyde (my Granddad) seated. We smile at each other. (215 words)

I'm an Asian man. My woman has run away and I'm running to catch her. I hear a siren behind me and wonder if I'd done something wrong. I'm on a narrow sand spit with water on both sides. As I get out there, I see a violent teen boy coming at me and I turn to run back. I have a bag (black) with a baby, a crochet hook and a gun in it. He stops me and I know I must protect the baby. I reach in for the hook, to give it to him in appeasement and I clumsily let him see the gun. We grapple for the bag and I grab the baby out and throw the bag into the water. I step on it to make it sink faster and huge air bubbles escape. I feel fear, excitement and a sense of being trapped for a moment. I fear the baby is in the bag. The sand spit now is a deflated air mattress and my floating is precarious. (174 words)

She takes me down a long hall, complaining that she can't breathe as she walks and hangs her shirt on a clothes line with herself in it so she can rest. I get angry at her and turn to go back and find the room. I see a sign that says "B's Enterprises Brothel." I sneer, "Who did that! "The woman is proud to say she did. It is in vibrant pink colors.

I and a man dance a bunny hop kind of step through a long double line of people who are clapping their hands. On the way back, I sing a lasagna recipe in a blues style. Then I get to my kitchen and tell people not to mind the mess. I don't like to do dishes. They are piled high, everywhere. There are lots of strange-looking glasses, blue, pretty, odd-shaped, multi-colored. I then stand at one of three sinks and start washing dishes. The sink is long and narrow and it's hard to reach the dish drainer. Later, I move to the side and see that that's the original correct place to stand. (113 words)

I'm on a motorcycle on an asphalt path. A guy on a motorcycle ahead of me is going slower than I am and I want to pass, but he doesn't notice and is in my way. I finally get around him, and go down a side path down a steep hill to a curio store. I see Indian dolls; one is supposed to be Theresa. I pick it up and think about buying it and decide not to. I already have lots. I see agates and stones and jewelry, etc. I don't buy anything. I decide to pack up my car and leave. I remember I have a pistol and decide to find it and put it in the front seat with me in case I need it. Usually I don't think ahead and have things ready so I can't help myself. There is something about protecting against my father. So I think its in my blue backpack, but it's not, but I find mint chocolate candies and put a patty of one on the front seat. I look in my suitcase and find the holster pistol. Now I drive and see signs for a junction of Hwy 9 and Hwy 6. I can't remember which one I should take, so I get out and walk back to reread the sign. I look at two or three before I find it. 7 goes to E City and then down the coast. Both highways get to my destination, but I choose 7 as my route, regretting having to back track home first. I go back to the car and see Ben Mitchell dancing by himself with a radio in his ear (headphones). He's really rocking out! I walk up to him. He hugs me and says he likes me. He wants me to find two handouts from my workshops to give to his brothers who need the information. I look through lots of paper to find the copy. I don't want him to take my original handwritten notes. I'll need them. A woman, Rebecca, is the sister of these men. I tell her, "Your brother is inarticulate and intelligent. He will find his way."

I go up to the fourth floor of the center building, looking for Rita's creativity class. I'm the guest speaker. I see a big crowd in the halls. I ask Rita if class will start soon or if I have time to go get lunch. She says, "Five minutes," so I say "Good, it's too crowded out there anyway." I see lots of orchids and calla lilies in green florist paper and comment on their beauty. Rita, who is glad to see me, says that the students brought them in. An angry young man enters the room and talks. He's complaining and noisy! I don't think Rita is handling it well, so I start my class lecture. He leaves. I use an allegory example from my childhood. I say, "Maybe the only way I can get my family to notice me is to make noise or trouble." So I shove some blocks and toys off a hassock onto the floor. Then I talk about filters. We are communicating to each other through many layers of ideas. So I talk about my mother having her filters and so by the time my noise gets to her, she's responding to that, not to my inner message of need. So I describe her reaction. "Be quiet. What's wrong with you behaving in this bad way." Her voice is angry and sarcastic. Rita and a woman student flinch at the strong negative picture I describe of my mother. I feel a little guilty. Maybe I went too far. The students admire me and my insights. (261 words)

Someone brings me some toy-like things that are promo's for a new play. I am supposed to display them to do PR, but I only want to keep them. They are so cute. I see a line of women who look like Ru, in wheelchairs! Each has a lap full of stuff. She's moving out of her room and her family is here to help her. Her dad and brothers are sort of tough Okies. I see a kitten whose head has been caught temporarily because a hassock stool has rolled too close. I know I need to let the kitty do it herself, but I feel sorry for it and move it. The kitty is mad at me and goes and hides. I go back to Ru's room. I look in. She's seated on her bed and one of her sisters is doing new wallpaper. She (Ru) says, "See the new floor covering?" It's a flower print linoleum. I am amazed her family completely transformed her room in just a short time - yellow and white fluffy curtains, matching bed spread, lots of ruffles. It's pretty. I go to my room (like a dorm or hospital) and notice I have paint and am relieved. It's easier to do than wallpaper. I sit in my bed and am putting white pearl nail polish on my left thumbnail. A nurse comes in and wants me to apply a jelly-like substance to my "infected (affected) area," the vagina (the jelly is like diaphragm jelly!). Instead, I wipe yellow diarrhea off my butt and then put the jelly on the vagina. Before I did this, I asked a nurse to pull the blinds. She was incompetent and couldn't follow my directions.

I walk into a big hall where there's a pancake feed going on. I feel very good, walking so easily and without pain. I pick up a huge tray of pancakes only cooked on one side. I carry them in and walk down a long line of tables. I see Aunt Rosalie and Uncle Gus seated alone near the end. I sit down across from them. I ask my mother to bring me a glass of milk, explaining that I had thought there was one here already, but it seems someone removed it. Uncle Gus stutters and drools a little. Aunt Rosalie looks emotionally exhausted and nervous. Someone asks me if I'm really going to ask him about the incest stuff and I firmly nod my head yes. I look at him and ask, "Tell me about it." He is shaken, like a child and scared. He stutters that he only did it to Darcy as a baby once and then Rosalie explained to him how it was wrong. He didn't quite see how, since Darcy wanted it, but it must be so. I realized he was a broken and ill man, not capable of understanding his own culpability. I laid off more questioning; it just didn't matter any more. (210 words)

The small children will play in the shallows part and the teens in the deeper part. I see my tent and my towel is set up right on the sink. I brush my teeth. A married couple says I can sleep in their tent and the implication is that no one will have sex so I won't be embarrassed. (95 words)

I'm in a church. Four of us are the "elders" who take the wine sacraments to the congregation. We stand facing each other in a square and bow our heads so the minister can pray over us. As he does, a beautiful angel comes and puts its wing over my shoulder and whispers to me. It is telling me I'm going to have a good relationship with the guy opposite me, a nice quiet family man. I am, of course, quite shocked to be having an angel talking to me and can't concentrate on my job. The little wine glasses jiggle and tremble and I spill wine in the tray. He helps me clean it up. As we walk back up the aisle, he helps me carry the tray so we don't spill anymore. We go to the kitchen area and pour off the spilt wine in a cup. I suggest we take it to the vestry as it is blessed wine. Then we go to the handshaking line and its too late, everyone's gone through (we are supposed to stand with the minister and shake hands with the departing people), so he starts typing a letter. I see a small 4-month-old baby. I go over and pick it up and cuddle it. An 8-year-old girl sees me and says I don't mind if she's going to be with my daddy, but she doesn't have to pick up the baby without permission! I didn't hear her and I go to the man and say, "Look at this cute baby." The man grins because it's his baby. I say, "You can hold it. I hope it isn't afraid of you. I'll finish typing the letter and you hold the baby." He agrees. As I'm typing, or trying to, the girl comes up to her daddy and says, "It's OK. I like her." He shushes her, embarrassed, and I did hear this time and now realize what's going on. He suggests we finish at his house, as he's cooking a turkey and doesn't know how, maybe I could help?

I see a parade. A long and large group of women are marching and they all are naked from the waist up. Lots of big boobs. Some have a towel around their neck that drapes down, partially covering themselves. I see them pass by and feel concern that they will get hassled. Sure enough, a group of men whistle and make lurid remarks, then I see the group marching back, in retreat. One man is leaning on the back of one woman like a dog fucking from behind. I am furious at them and him in particular. I feel sorry for the woman. The police are following the couple trying to pry the guy off the woman. They reform and start to march again. I come out onto the sidewalk and see a few men standing nearby. I stare at them angrily. One man says, "Uh! oh! Here's a feminist." I don't respond to him, but belligerently glare. Another man approaches a man in a wheelchair and starts to make inane stereotyped remarks. I turn to him and say, "First sexism and now handicapism. Be careful, you are making a fool of yourself in public." (195 words)

I am trying to counsel a series of people who are deaf. One man won't look at me so I can lecture or counsel him. So I write on a paper, "Damn prig." He is shocked and then reads my lips. I am pretty good at helping them. Now I'm in the back seat of my car. A woman wants to get in. She can't decide if it should be the front or back seat. I hope she doesn't taker the driver's seat, but she does. Then I see an opportunity and take over. Then three women want a ride home and I ask them where they live because if its too far, I won't do it. They give their addresses and I nod, OK, even though one is pretty far away. (132 words)

I'm in my power chair, but the left side is gone and it needs fixing. I go to this industrial building to find a genius engineer to revamp my chair so its like a manual but fast and powerful. I can't get through a barrier so I move two bikes out of the way. They keep sliding down from the wall and I get frustrated putting them back up. I go in and see a group of men, one in a huge chair. The rest are standing. I pass up the chair guy and ask for Jim Short, the engineer. The man is not helpful, but finally agrees to show me where he is. I had to convince him I knew what I was talking about. He gets into a cart with toys in it and we go down a tunnel that is cement and dark. He goes slow and I say in exasperation, "I can go faster than this." (160 words)

I'm in a car feeding french fries to three children, feeling selfish because I ate them first. The driver says, "75 cents for a cup of coffee! Oh, well, my mother wanted me out of the house for a while, you know how it is." I nod and then she is a woman that looks like Patricia and I think, "No wonder you (Lydia) don't like her." We come to a house and see a child bathing in water coming out of a broken pipe. "Oh look," says Patricia, pleased. "Yeah," I say, but that means it's not fixed yet. (100 words)

I am a teen and I've been invited to sit at the head table with the rich and intelligent ones. I am honored. They ask me if I think classical or rock music is better. I say definitely classical. An old man is dying. At first they won't let me into see him because I'm so young, but my sensible attitude and emotional strength are seen and I am permitted. I hug him, weeping. We say goodbye. I go on and become an intellectual genius having taken "ap" classes in high school and learning in a single-minded fashion. [BL] (98 words)

It's a kissing contest. The guys are lined up. I decide to get in the women's line, the only one in a wheelchair. There is some surprise and a little jeering. I come up to the first guy in line, William Shatner. He sticks out his hand and I shake it. I say, "This is a kissing contest!" So I start to kiss him and he turns his cheek. I feel hurt. I go to the next guy. He kisses me honestly and sweetly. I am a good kisser and he sighs and says, "Wow." William Shatner realizes he's missed something good and wants to kiss me now. I am very angry and yell at him and hit him, "What a jerk. You thought I was just an uninteresting cripple and go to the next one." It's a package and I try to unwrap it. I have trouble cutting the strings, but finally open it and see a folded up yellow shirt. I look for a face where the head of a man should be. I lift up the collar and see an identical shirt and laugh. Then I see a name card behind that, "Robin Williams." I say I'd like to kiss him! I go to the next one, Burt Lancaster. He is eloquent and classy. He picks me up and with each long kiss he puts me in a Fred Astaire dip. Everyone oohs and ahhhs and applauds. I love it. I'm such a good kisser, he doesn't want to stop. I go on to others. I vote Burt the best male kisser. They vote me the best female kisser. (272 words)

I have a wealthy, large house and I'm walking through it noticing all the luxurious niceties. I go down a long flight of stairs and look out back. I see a camp structure, an overhang roof on ropes and love it. It is special, North American Indian and from the past. I prefer to spend my time there than in the house. I call Howard' s attention to it. Later, I am the boss woman in the strawberry fields, overseeing my workers. I go back through the house, now noticing it looks ill kept and ordinary on the outside and glad of it because no one will rob it then. I notice the back porch and that special camp place are really nice looking and I can't wait to get there. (131 words)

I am in love with an Indian whose name is Orange. It's a special and warm relationship. I also am very attracted to this white guy that's like an actor in "Crossing Delancy." The two of them walk off together and I worry they will fight and I will lose them both. When they come back, I see they have exchanged hats and I am so happy. It means they have reached an understanding and both still love me. (79 words)

I'm on a rock cliff and there's a dark storm going on. An earthquake happens. Now I'm in the water and swim away from the cliff because of the falling rock. The water is dark, cold and has very high swells. As I get out deeper, I see a shark fin, and become afraid of deep sea monsters. I'm stuck now. There are monsters to the left of me, falling rocks to the right. I go back toward shallow waters. Then the quake stops and I get back on land. My mother calls over from the apartments across the rocky ridge. She wants to go on the beach and wants to know if it's safe. I look out and see the tide's out and people are playing on the sand. I prefer being on the dry sand; it seems safer than the rock or the water. So I say, "Let's go." We go out to find things. I find two ink pens. I notice the tide is coming back in and warn Ellie. I see three books in a hole in the sand. I try to pick them up but the tide comes in and I get knocked down and all wet. I say, "Oh, no. I got wet and cold for nothing!" I go toward shore. There are little cubicles that people live in. Their beds and things are all stacked up in there. (235 words)

I find chocolate flavored toothpaste. I laugh and decide to buy it. Then a man offers me a set of books that will help me write better.

I am sitting, fully clothed, on a toilet in a waiting room area. I don't have to go to the bathroom, but I feel safer or better there. Twice the saleslady peeks in and asks if I'd rather come out where it's more comfortable. I say, "I'd rather stay here," and then I realize maybe someone else might need the bathroom so I get up and go out. There are two couches and I pick up my mail. There are lovely surprises there: boxes of samples and things I'd sent for. I start to sit on a couch (I think I'm waiting for my van to be fixed), but the sales lady's papers are there so I apologize and start for the other couch. She apologizes and says, "No. Please sit there." So I do. I tell her I was sick in the night, but then I got better. (149 words)

I am standing on a small piece of land. There is a huge body of water to my left and in front of me. A single tree stands to my right. Someone says, "Here's the forest." I laugh and say, "Some forest!" There is one tree left. All the rest have been chopped down. I see two people seated under the water. I wonder how they can breathe. One rises up and starts approaching me. I get scared because this is a "siren," a spirit that wants to lure me away. She starts to bite on my ankle. I move so that she ends up biting the base of the ancient tree. If I'd let her bite me, I'd have been a goner. She hovers near and keeps trying. I must focus my energies on keeping away from her. I see a single line of ancient trees stretched out in front of me (in single file), the last remains of a huge and lush forest. The land is totally barren. I must walk across the cut branches (stumps) to get to safety. The water roils and seems threatening. [BL] (188 words)

I am in a long hall and reach a door. A male siren spirit in a white tuxedo or formal dinner jacket approaches me. I'm backed up to the door and can't get it open. He's coming closer and I'm afraid, maybe he'll kill me. Maybe there will be pain, but as his transparent body floats into mine, I become aware of love and passion and don't want to leave. I can't feel him physically but I feel his emotions. They are intense and I am so hungry for those good feelings, I don't attempt to escape. (97 words)

I'm in an acting class. One woman doesn't like me. I am trying to make some very colorful posters with pictures and ribbon. The top border ribbon is red and says "Mexico" on it. It looks plain and unfinished and I keep trying to make it change. Finally it is pretty. I get up on a ladder or some boxes that are off balance and I try to tie the poster to some nails. I have trouble. I use thumb tacks and have several in my mouth. Finally I get four or so of them up. The woman is angry at me because I succeeded and she didn't. (108 words)

I'm in a river raft in the back. A man is in the front. I tell him I can't swim. He says, "Hang on." We hit the rapids. The raft is tipping up and I throw myself onto the man to put more weight in the front. It works and I'm pleased with myself for quick thinking. I also like being there in a semi-embrace with him. We come through a tunnel of white water and are safe. [BL] (78 words)

I am now returning to the acting class. I go too far down the hall to a room where ritzy, well-dressed people are. I back track and find the room. The woman teacher is there and I ask her if she would mind if I could be an assistant director. She says, "How will this help?" I start counting on my fingers how it would help. "First, for me," I say and I pause and repeat it because it felt selfish to say for me first. But I decide it is proper and I say, "For me, I would gain skills and experience. For you, after I learn blocking, I could run some of the rehearsals and you could have time off." "I'll have to ask the class," she says. I agree and point out one woman will say no. She doesn't like me. So I tell the class how I've married this Protestant. They ask if my father is angry. I say, "No because I divorced my Catholic family." Then a woman sadly says, "At first, he won't read your letters and then later, when he dies, he'll speak of you in his last words." She cries. "It was like that with her dad," someone says. "But your sister will be angry and hurt." I agree it was like that with my father. They vote me in, all except the one woman. [BL] (233 words)

It's 1:30 am and I let some talented piano players play a grand piano at my parents' house. I shush him because he's too loud and might wake up my parents. They do wake up but aren't too upset. The piano player asks, "What happened to his computer? Is he poor?" I explain they used to be poor, but are doing much better now. I go and ask him what happened to his computer. He says, "It's being fixed and will be returned." (83 words)

It is Willie's funeral and I am coming in. As I get to the door, I am standing with a guy who looks like Nat Ivy of LLG and like Willie. He's cute to look at, but he keeps embarrassing me with his outrageous comments. He looks in at the gathered people through the glass windows. He says, "Look at those niggers." I am scandalized and shush him. He points to the black people in the back row. He and I walk in. I'm kind of cuddled up to him and following where he goes. He goes to the front of the room and dances in a closet with skeleton/Star War troopers. It's kind of kinky, sexy. I am embarrassed. He gets out and we walk around to the back of the room. We watch an instant review of a video where this blonde guy comes in and realizes Willie is dead and he yells and sobs, "No! No! It isn't possible!" He's embarrassed he was caught off guard. I see my cousin Dora seated facing us, people around her. I want to join her but can't because this is Willie's funeral and yet I am with an alive Willie. We sit down on a side bench and play silly "lover" games with our hands, like we can't touch each other and then accidentally touch and hold hands and then break away, giggling. We repeat that over and over. (239 words)

I am hiding from something (maybe war) and I spend lots of months in a cellar of a woman's house. It's cold and damp and empty, but I'm alive. I come out when its safer. I see the woman of the house who shows me the special rooms she had prepared to hide me, with beds and doilies and lots of pretty things. I see a blue cup with the picture of a cat on the inside and I'm holding my cat under my arm who sticks her nose into the cup to see it better. I say, "How pretty it is," hoping she'll give it to me, but she doesn't. I walk up a flight of stairs and look out the window (see drawing). I come back down and the woman apologizes for my dreadful stay in her cellar. I say, "Hey! At least I'm alive. I thank you for my life." I am grateful to her even though I couldn't reach the nice place in time. (168 words)

I want to clean up things in this storage area. I'm painting a sort of closet/box. Someone comes by to help. They start painting the outside wall green. "No," I say, "Not there. On the front inside panel." (It looks like the enclosure around my heat pump.) Then there's a wall toilet, long and narrow like in some public restrooms, the kind you can't figure out how to sit. The woman says, "I think I'll flush it before I clean it." I say, "Go ahead but no one's used it." I look in to see urine and four used, but not bloody, sanitary napkins. I'm embarrassed she saw that. I blame Ellie. (112 words)

I'm in my apartment which was made out of a school building. People stroll in and out. I see three men at the far end writing on a blackboard. I walk over to them and say, "I know it doesn't look like it, but you are in my home." He holds up the chalk eraser. I say, "I know, pretty unusual in a home, but its true." I walk them out, only to discover a classroom full of people. I realize the landlord has allowed them to share my entryway. So I suggest to the teacher that we share costs for a barrier partition. Then I see a man at the other end and I go to him and say, "What do you think you are doing? This is a home." He's seated on my couch with another woman; they are talking. He says to her, "How about coming over to my place?" meaning sex. She sighs and apologizes for being sympathetic, and thereby misleading him. She says, "Girls are like that." I say to him, "There's the front door." I'm disgusted with him. I look out on the porch and see Jake playing the piano, so I feel a little safer. (202 words)

I see long rows of tree-like sticks that are my body cells in enlarged form (see drawing). As I pass by the front of the lines, I see lots of dusty debris cluttering up the back portion of the cells like giant lint or dust balls. Now I am looking under a house. I see a talis slope of rocks and a small shelf way up under the beams (see drawing). I see like a zoom lens and I'm coming closer to a corner under the eves. A red and white thing is all messed up in a heap there and I feel terror. I think, "I don't want to see." It's like my childhood memories and it will scare me or be too ugly to look at. But as I come closer, it changes into a sweet kitty and it sits there looking at me. I feel better now. The place is dusty and cold and long forgotten, except for that cute kitty. (164 words)

A good-looking man likes me. I decide it's time to do my cleansing ritual. He suggests I do it in the fireplace in the living room with the 25 people seated at the tables watching. I laugh and say, "No way. The space is too small and all those people watching." I imagine they would all politely clap their hands after I accomplished my task, saying in cool, clipped accents, "That's nice B." The guy and I laugh at the silliness of their British audience routine. I say, "I'll do it in the swimming pool." Hasani says, "It's too cold." I say, "I only have to do it for three minutes. Maybe you could run some hot water into the corner I'll be in." She agrees. The man looks at my black swim suit-encased figure admiringly. [BL] (136 words)

I'm applying for a teaching job. I push a button outside the music room and a taped lecture comes on. I am embarrassed because I don't know how to turn it off and it's loud. I see a digital clock counting the minutes and seconds it will continue. I walk out of the building because there isn't anything else to do. I walk to a mental hospital for war-injured men. I go in and I'm dressed in a suit and heels and look pretty. The men whistle and tease. I look for the head nurse. She's nowhere around. The kitchen is unstaffed. I go talk to the men in their beds. One shares with me a box of papers, their secret plans. I am trusted by some. I need to protect them from the bad head nurse who is dressed in white and is cold to them. I have an argument with her about how the men need normal stuff around them. I am angry at her and run after her and hit her with the right cross fist. We roll on the ground and I'm slapping her tiny-sized head back and forth. Someone is worried I'll kill her, but I let her go, to leave forever. She refuses to change, so I make her leave.

I'm on a boat with Ellie and it goes into a cave. The current pulls us deeper and deeper into the darkness. It's scary. We are literally "going to hell." We enter a huge cavern with fluorescent phosphorous lighting. There are bats in there. They flutter near our heads. Around the corner is the center of the earth. We hope we'll go through and go out the other side to daylight and fresh air. The only other choice is to paddle hard against the current. (85 words)

I am leaving Ginny's to go home, but have to stop off at a hospital because I'd made an appointment with a woman administrator to look at my books (children's books), but I can't remember for sure the time (3:30 or 6:30) and then I can't remember her name. We get there and ask and go to an auditorium where a speaker is talking to a full house. Charla is handed person to person because they think she is so cute. I cry out, "Give me back my baby!" I am upset and worried they'll keep her. The crowd is frowning at me. I'm being silly and hysterical. I ask a man what group this is and he finally understands my question and says, "Illustrators." Then the speaker says, "We ran over three minutes, so you'd better get back to work!" I was amazed they had such strict "factory" like rules about how they work. I go to wait in a coffee shop. Ellie, Ginny and Charla are with me. I lecture Charla on being careful about strangers. I dig through my packs to find my flyers and can't find them, but see a skirt I was going to change into to look more professional. I haven't time now. I feel scattered and frustrated. (214 words)

I'm called into the community college "Board Room" to explain some financial decisions I made when I was working at Disability Student Services. I'm nervous and can't imagine what I may have done wrong. I walk in. People are surprised at how improved I am. They have a space without a chair ready for me at the round table. I pull up a chair and sit. A bright spotlight kind of light is shining in my eyes. I see people, women, setting things up. They bring boxes of things. I realize it's going to be an award to honor me. They say, "Bring them in," and I watch as young girls, disabled women and Indian women come in to observe. They nod respectfully at me. I am their sole role model. A male teacher comes in and wants to have his lunch as he usually does in this room. He's annoyed and complains we've taken away his privileges. I suggest he use the teacher's lounge at the other end of the building. He is not happy. He's going to ruin my awards program. (183 words)

Bonnie and I are at a store/restaurant and she orders lots of different food. It comes time to pay the bill. She's had a few glasses of wine and now orders a cute little puppy to take home. We go to the counter to pay and to pick up the puppy. Bonnie is upset that her part of the bill is so much more than mine; she hasn't realized it's because she ate much more than me. I feel angry and guilty so I offer to pay the tip and pull out $3.19 and put it on the table. The sales woman goes to the back room and brings the leftover food orders and a cute puppy. I see a basket of sweet puppies in the back room. I ask to buy a cat. She brings me a black cat and I hold it, pleased. Then she says, "But you wanted a white cat." I feel upset because I like the black cat, but I'm willing to change my mind. I follow her into the back room and she hands me a tiny white toy like those clip-on animals. It's stiff. It had been clipped on a pole with thousands of others crammed together. I am disgusted and say, "I wanted a real cat." It opens its enormous black eyes and I realize the poor thing is alive. I feel sad for it and angry at the woman for the dreadful living condition she forces on these little creatures. I refuse to buy anything from her to teach her a lesson. (261 words)

I am young and kissing my beau. He wants more and I sense it. I say, "Do you want more of this?" He says yes. I say, "I have to go to the bathroom and think about it. Really." So I go into a bathroom and sit on a toilet and pee, and then I walk out to him and hug him, kissing him passionately and say, "Yes." He is so happy and we walk arm in arm, really connected and in love. We pass Jake and Valerie all dressed up and walking together, Jake's arm around Valerie. We are at the Hilton. I smile at them, but they don't respond. I say to my guy, "Maybe she didn't recognize me because I'm standing." She then comes back and says, "Hi." We all walk together. Jake and my guy used to work together and Jake has made it big. He gives my guy 90 (0?) percentage, which pleases him. We walk out past a display in a museum where we see Basaltic rock columns rising and falling. The narrative tells us that that's where the Killer Bees live and thank God, they are disappearing so there's less bees. I see two naked men tortured by being covered with these bees. One man opens his mouth at their command to let them in and out. He is in extreme pain. It is horrible. The bees stored honey in his nipple. I feel sick and walk away. [BL] (245 words)

I am directing my own play. I see two male twins, dark hair, moustaches. I think it would be fun to write them in and then the play is being performed and I'm in it, looking out at the audience. Then I'm in the audience, watching as Ellie and I are in front of the curtain. I'm on her shoulders and she loses her line and we both fuddle around. I fall down. "I" in the audience notices we look very much alike, plump, etc. I crawl and then get up and run off stage, amazed I could do it myself and get ahead of Ellie. Now I'm on stage again and bowing. I see people putting a table and chairs for the awards dinner. I go down and sit next to this old guy. He says he was miserable, but I inspired him. I sigh, "I suppose you mean my disability." He says yes. I am not pleased. It spoils my award dinner and I regret having sat next to him. Ellie is several chairs over to my right. (180 words)

I'm going to a psychology conference and am in the city a day early, so I find another conference to go to so I can stay in a hotel. I go to the desk to get my room assignment and they tell me there's been a change. I owe $170 a night because they only had a "2 and 1/3" room, very elite, left. I say, "Sorry. Can't afford that. You must come up with a regular room." They discover they made a mistake and give me a key to a regular room. Mary Sexton is with me and we go find the elevator. We laugh at the unusualness of the elevator. It is roomy, ornate and has two porcelain bowls that at first look like toilets, and mirrors. We get to our floor and pass several alcoves where patrons of the hotel are lying or sitting in cute, ornate barbershop chairs and so on that vibrate, massage and make them laugh. I find my room and go in. It is filled with books, games, videos, and fun things to do. I go to the hall now because I hear the guide calling people to come to the next planned activity. We go outside to see a parade, which isn't much, and then I look up in the sky and see a beautiful spun glass star falling to the lawn. I rush to be the one to catch it and pounce on it like a football tackle, fighting off the hotel employees who want it too. I clutch it as they explain to me they have to have it back. The stars are for show and they cost a lot. But I won't let go. I want that star. It's attached to a fishing line and they try to reel it back, but I hang on doggedly! They finally give up because I have a "death" grip on it and won't let go. I take my star and go back toward the hotel. I haven't moved this much in years! I'll sure be sore tomorrow, but it was worth it. (350 words)

Charla and I are getting into my van. I put her in the passenger side and together we hook the seat belt. A car is parked too close to the lift door, so I grab my key out of the door and go over to the driver's side. I try to get in, but Charla is standing in the seat playing with the steering wheel. I ask her to move and she won't so I yell at her, and bodily move her and then I get in. She's crying and I explain to her, "Do you know why I did that? Because Grandma can't stand up very long. It hurts her." She seemed to understand and quiet down. I feel guilty. I see papers, folders and wallets on the parking lot area near us. I get out and pick them up. I throw away the folders (of school kids), keep two nice pens (why waste good ink?) and look into the wallets. There is no money, but lots of stamps, letters and stationery. I think about taking them into the store we're near but decide that's too hard physically and decide to go home and call the owners and have them come pick them up. So I turn out into the street and realize I went past our street. Now I'm at a busy intersection where I have to turn right and that will put me on a busy freeway to the bridge. I say, "Darn it!" Charla says, "What?" I say, "I took the wrong turn and now I'm stuck. It will be a ways before we can turn around," but as the light changes, I see a way to cross straight and miss the bridge. I hesitate and then go. Now I'm looking for a left turn that will be a through street so I can get back to where I want. All the streets I try are dead end. I'm turning around at one dead end and Charla says, "I'm going boom," which means she's started her period. "But," she continues, " I don't feel anything sticky." I laugh and say, "You can't start your period for another ten years yet." I think she's cute, wanting to grow up so fast and want to remember this to tell her mama. (383 words)

Scattered frenzied images. I am angry at a man and I walk down stairs and gather up my videos and things and take them back upstairs. He yells, "Not my TV guide." He's furious and chases me, throwing things and pouring salt and pepper at me. (46 words)

A man (like Nate) rubs a thick cream on my right thigh. As it soaks in, I am nearly overcome with sexual desire, but I fight it valiantly. I must not give in. A young girl walks toward us innocently. I yell at her, "Run, run and get Father. If only I can resist until Father comes to save me." The man grins and waits for me. [BL] (67 words)

I am blind and discover my family home has been destroyed and I break into frenzied tears. I sob and my mother is quite surprised at me. I didn't cry when I went blind and now I'm mad with grief over this. I say, "A house where we all lived together will never be again, and I was going to get married in my father's physics lab."

My father and I have a mountain "luety" (can't decipher my own handwriting in book) of mined-out gold in it and I must learn physics to get it out. I go to a bar where the class is held and I'm very annoyed because he's going slow for the others and I have lots to learn quickly and haven't time to waste. I learn much quicker than they do.

I sell my house and buy another one I think I'll like better, but as I walk around in it, I discover holes, rotten floor boards. It's falling apart. It's smaller. I find a small storage room that I see a long drop to a rock base under the rickety floor board. I see a skull with a hatchet in it. I then compare bills with the previous owner. She owes me $40 and I owe her $40 and more. I can't remember. (83 words)

I am on stage. I have a special guitar for my arthritic fingers and I tease the audience about how I can't play and then I wow them with a great song. Ellie comes on stage and sits facing me at my left. Charla dances on stage and she and I do this little imitative dance of each other's movements. The audience loves us and applauds wildly. I say, "And this is my granddaughter." They applaud again. We go off stage. I can still see the audience through a tall door that was opened so the kids can see. (99 words)

I am at the old M City house, sitting on the front yard, near the bad corner so close to the road I nearly get run over. I see Darryl coming up to the door and I follow him, asking, "Why did you leave me?" He can't answer. We go inside and I see all the furniture is different. The piano's in the dining room and the fireplace is on the wrong wall. I see my parents, who smile at me. I walk through the dining room and see the "pool room" now transformed into a sweet, pretty sitting room, frilly curtains, china, another fireplace. The kitchen is different too. I look into the stairwell and then return to the living room. Charla follows me. I see Darryl seated in an overstuffed chair and I sit on his lap and Charla joins us. Darryl starts to explain how he tried to come back for me. I feel pulled in two directions: toward Charla (the present or the future) and toward Darryl (the past). (173 words)

Someone is hitting golf balls into a high wind over a cliff. They don't get far! One person managed to hit one a good distance and we line up golfers to measure how many golfers' length it went. Then someone cheats and moves the ball so we can't be accurate. (50 words)

A baseball game is in progress. I'm in the stands watching. A guy has a box of balls, one has a pumpkin in it that weights it so he can cheat. He's very careful to protect it so no one will know. Then he decides to nonchalantly bounce it around (looks like a small basketball), but he drops it in a pile of other balls and a boy grabs it and runs off. I say, "It was the redhead. I'll watch for him." Now Paul Newman is going up to bat. I stand directly behind him so close our bodies are touching and I copy all his moves. "I'm playing baseball too," I say. He grins at me. Later, he's seated in the stands and I cuddle and I kiss with him. I touch his lips and say, "Only my lipstick." He teases me by pretending he might kiss someone else and I possessively grab him and kiss him long and sweet to keep him to me. He's aroused and we lie down. I am stroking his very hairy arm which is down by his waist so that it's almost like his penis, only furry from the amount of arm hairs. He does have a hard one and I feel good because I "have" him.

I am walking down the corridor of a hospital and see a new born baby in his bassinet in the hall. The mother is upset and the baby is crying. I go to the baby and caress his head and send "loving" vibes to it. It calms down and sleeps. The nurses are very impressed with my ability and ask me to help out with the preemie's who may die if not nurtured. I go to the nursery and am handed a tiny baby that fits into my hands, so unformed, it's face doesn't have skin yet, just muscle and red. I lay it on my left arm and cuddle it. I concentrate all my loving energies toward it. Now the baby looks like a baby. I go to a sink and put water on my arms as that is better for the baby. I feel a need to pee, but can't leave the baby even for a moment. A nurse suggests she get me a bed pan. I try to feed the baby and suddenly it starts sucking at the thin drops of "mother's milk" I offered on a tiny tube/stick. At first I'm concerned she will choke, but she really is eating and swallowing, gaining strength. I am pleased and in awe. She's gaining weight. She is surviving! [BL] (220 words)

I am told to write the story of a 3-year-old girl who spent the "war years" in a hidden room, rather comfortably furnished with left over chairs and drapes. Someone says they had remembered it was all cream-colored. I muttered, "So much for accurate memory." She and her mother had been in that room hiding during the Nazi years. So I started writing the story on leftover paper, writing in the patches between other words. Millie comes over and starts to read it. I ask to see hers. She says, "No. It's not very good. Not like yours. Look at your first sentence. It's so clear, and you spent last night with those Indians, too." She meant I'd been busy babysitting some active boys and didn't have time to work on the story. (133 words)

Second dream: I'm on a bus. We are musicians in a band going to our next gig. I am playing my banjo and the others are listening. The music is quite beautiful. I start to put words to the song and come up with, "Pretty boys, pretty boys" and then the slow soft melody builds to a crescendo and the words "anger, anger, anger." The boys in the bus lose interest. It had looked to be very special and beautiful song and then I had ruined it by "trivializing" the beautiful music. The bus is slowing down and I put the banjo in its case, picking up lots of finger picks that had fallen out on the floor. (118 words)
Barb Sanders:#1635 (12/19/89)

Third dream: I am standing on a sidewalk and a beautiful Indian man stands at my left. He's a dancer and the music is calling him. He starts to dance away and turns, smiling to invite me to dance with him. He'll teach me how to dance. As we are walking, the scene changes and we are walking into a cathedral. I think to myself, "How odd. Why am I dreaming a catholic church?" Then I notice it's a Mexican Mission. We are drawn in as a part of the crowd. We go upstairs and move to seats very close to another Indian man who is preparing his instrument. I am equally attracted to him and go closer. He has a guitar with a printer in it. Other objects are attached to it to make unusual music. I say to my friend, "Look, He has a large mosquito tied to a string." It hums and he amplifies it when it's appropriate. Unique instruments. Later, my dancing friend and I are in a car. He's in the driver's seat and we're about to drive away. (I'm in the passenger seat.) I look out the window and see a two-story house with windows that roll down like car windows and most of them are open. I see two huge bears (grizzlies) starting to get out the windows. I tell my Indian man and he gets out to stop them. I see the two bears followed by a dog running away. In the sky are a helicopter and several planes. I begin to cry, left all alone in the car. I keen and lament, "I've lost everything I've ever loved." My two beautiful Indian men are gone. I weep uncontrollably. [BL] (287 words)

I am a baby in a crib. I am very afraid. A person comes and stands looking at me. It's one of my parents, but I don't know which one because they have a sack over their head (see drawing). I am screaming in terror because I'm afraid I'll be hurt or thrown out the window. It's leaning toward me. Then I somehow realize that if I smile and am charming, I'll be safe. So I coo and smile and the parent relaxes and I am not in danger. But I still feel the fear under the mask of "charm." It's a heavy burden to never be what you really feel. Now I'm grown up and going downstairs. I see lots of my relatives in the kitchen. They want me to help open the window, a big square thing that opens toward you, like in school. It's over the sink. I have to use a tall stick to reach the opening at the top, and then as it opened, it got kind of wobbly and I had to balance it carefully. Big preparations are going on around me. My mother is dressed up in special "going to church" clothes. The foods are rich and plentiful, quite party-like, not the usual fare; like a big family reunion dinner, only better. I am aware of my informal clothes. I ask my mother what's going on. She says, "We're getting ready to divide up Grandma Mildred and Pa Lloyd's things." I ask if everyone will be there, even Aunt Millie. "Oh yes," she says. "Aunt Millie said she'd be here later." We go to the dining room and look for our place tags. I see mine with the package of my "portion" of things. It's a plastic bag like a sandwich bag. I open it to see four baby outfits in it. I'm a little disappointed. I look again to see they're changed, to four bras. Then I see a picture of Aunt Millie when she was in high school. I see only half of her face and I say, "She looks angry" (see drawing). (352 words)

I am rehearsing and planning some presentation with a few people. It's lots of work and I finally give up and say to the others, "I hope you don't mind; let's scrap what we've started. Other groups are just being spontaneous and do something simple and direct." They agree. (49 words)

A naked man walking with a white horse follows us, spying. He is hidden in the grasses and I see his eyes peeking out. When he gets close, I realize he's a friend.

A man is gardening in a special gardening room. I join him. The rows are racked and I'm standing at the top looking down at him. The scruffy down and out kids come and he's eager to play with them again, to help them out of their shells of mistrust. They don't respond when he tries to get them to laugh. I grab one and tickle her on the shoulder. She finds this very funny and we roll around laughing, her laugh so beautiful and child-like its catchy. Soon we're all doing it. Someone asks me what's my favorite word and I say, "laughter." (104 words)

I go into my sister Lydia's house to visit. I see room after room that go far back into the house as I walk from one room to the next saying, "I had no idea you had so many rooms that she could use." An open door led to a restaurant and a waitress heard my remark and agreed. We go into another room and Lydia is upset. She says a man had just had a heart attack and had fallen forward onto a chest of drawers, badly marking the wood and Doug will be upset! I am shocked she had witnessed a death and turn to see this mark, but it's so tiny I can barely see it. I try to soothe her and am annoyed she's so upset about Doug's reaction. We then go outside, we'd gone full circle and have come out a side front door. She says, "See my beautiful view?" I look up and suddenly notice a magnificent range of mountains, lush green and wild. I say, "You really do have a beautiful view." I then see quite large people mountain climbing with ropes, some throwing themselves off the mountain and looking terrified and then the rope catching them so they were safe. I say I'd not like to do that. Then we go for a walk by the raging river, all brown and roiling. As I near it, I have to lay down because I feel afraid I'll lose my balance and fall in. We move away and Lydia says it's about ready to do a loop wave and might flood the house. I say, "Your house gets flooded?" She says "Yeah, sometimes." Later I get in my van, but before we can leave, I must empty the water from a vacuum cleaner-like thing. I open the sliding door and pour the water from the hose to the curb. It flows and flows and flows. I am amazed (astounded). It is so much water. At one point the van floats like a log and nearly crushes a floating face. I push the van away from the curb, just in time, and feel relieved the near accident was prevented. (364 words)

I am at a big social where crowds of people are milling around getting acquainted. I feel shy and look at all the people as they swirl around me. A man, stocky build like a strong teddy bear, asks me to please be kind and dance with him so he won't have to continue this torture, of being alone and looking. I agree and we dance and dance around and around. He is comfortable, fun and kind. I enjoy his company and vice versa. As we whirl, he says, "Look at the face on that woman," and then turns us so I can enjoy what he saw. We are very much attuned to each other. Finally, I say, "I have to stop. I have arthritis and need to take some aspirin soon or I'll be hurting badly." He is concerned and helpful. (142 words)

Howard is visiting and sleeping in Ellie's room. I am moving photographic enlarger equipment around. He gets up and, out of politeness, I ask what he'd like for breakfast, feeling annoyed that I'm the only one around and have to do it. I list pancakes, eggs, toast, and he smiles and says, "Thank you." "All of the above, eh?" I say and sigh. I go to the kitchen and am cooking waffles and so on. Karen and her son are there also and talking to me. Howard is trying to hold my hand and talk to me also. I'm having a hard time trying to listen to all of them. I don't like the fact that he's holding my hand, but I allow it. He's upset because he wants all my attention and he wishes Karen and son would go away. I am touched by his tenderness and also uncomfortable. (150 words)

I go to a woman's house with a pair of pants/shorts for my 36-month-old boy I have in her daycare center. Someone says, "You know you're here when you see the spectacular view," and I turn and see beautiful waterfalls that crash and splash back up the mountain. Then the woman says, "Look out! Here comes the god in the waterfall," and I see a man-shaped waterfall flying around in the air. Everyone is respectful of the power energy and unpredictable nature of this god. I'm now sitting in the back seat of a car with the woman. The god of the waterfall comes to my window and likes me. He's like a man at the moment - full lips, a little plump and sensual. He asks me for a kiss. I agree if he'll exchange one wish for one kiss. He agrees and then floats into the car and we kiss. I kiss very well. He loves it. He's not the best kisser, kind of limp and open-mouthed, but I feel strong tenderness and warmth that I like. Then I try to decide what to wish for. I think about health and happiness and then decide to wish for creativity, the words I need to really write excellent work. He agrees to grant my wish. (216 words)

I tell them how I was at Dover at a Mobility International conference and had ghosts in my bath, ghosts taking MY bath! I couldn't say the word "bath" correctly. It was more like Napt.

Charlton Heston and his son are captured. So am I. We are put in a zoo. We are in a pool swimming back and forth like the polar bears. I understand how the bears feel, bored, angry, hopeless. Then we escape and run through the forests. The bad guy that wants us dead owns a shop and we go in and look at the merchandize - black boxes, shiny enamel, huge puppet dolls, tiny miniatures. I'm interested in the minis. He's telling people he'll sell the big things at a discount, so he'll have room for more things. We realize he's after us and escape as we go up a hill. We see he has cannons bombing the village we left. People are dying because he's trying to kill us. We go to another village and steal a small child's chair and go under a table to hide. A woman is already there and is angry at us. She insists we leave. We do and now are in the tree tops swinging from one branch to another! He'll never find us, but we'll be on the run and alone forever. Charlton hands me a life saver. I say, "Do I have bad breath?" He says yes. A woman says, "He didn't think it would be so easy to tell you." Then she tells me to take a bath. "I really stink?" I ask. She says, "Yes. Terribly. I'd be inundated with waves of the smell, especially the hope, waves of hope. Disgusting." (252 words)

I go peek in and see Charla's still asleep, I'm worried Arvonne will be upset at the mess in Charla's room and then worried Arvonne will be angry if Charla wakes up and is noisy.

After church, there's a Bible study group and we are there. I feel sleepy and lean back to nap. Grandma does too and then she gets up on the back of the curved couch to lay down, like a cat would, her feet hit the face of a man in the group, she scoots over to my side. I smile to see her like that. Then I say, "It's after 2:00, can we leave pretty soon?" She agrees and I start packing up my supplies, disks, pencils, papers, to take with me. I leave six pencils that might have been the church's property, hoping I don't take their stuff with mine. We drive off. [BL] (176 words)

I get into my special car, a sports model, red and sleek, convertible. It only needs a 1/4 of a gallon to go hundreds of miles! It practically drives itself. I suspect aliens gave it to me and am a little suspicious of what I'll have to "pay" for its use. I pick up Ginny, Ernie and their two boys. Bonnie will meet us there. I touch the door handle and it opens, the key turns and starts the car. I have mirrors all over the windshield so I can see everything clearly and the car drives itself when I'm not concentrating on the road. We get to the support/training area. I have several grocery sacks of things which I put under a table. I tell myself to remember to grab them if we have to leave suddenly. I play a tiny banjo-like instrument and tease a cute little cat with it. (152 words)

I'm in a small house waiting for the doctor's appointment time. A baby girl and I are seated on a couch. She's busy and mischievous. I sit on a plastic potty on the couch and pee, my pants are down and the door opens and the baby brings in this guy from the bank who gives me my new checks. I am embarrassed and pull my blouse down to cover the panties and the potty and pretend to be sitting there normally. He raises his eyebrows and stares. I smile and then after he's gone, I am angry at the baby for not knocking first. Then it's time to go and I pour the pee in a sink and search for my keys. I get out of the car to see I've picked up sacks of things I don't need and I don't have what I need, the keys. I'm annoyed at the baby. We'll have to go to the bigger house to get the keys unless I have a spare pair in my purse. I ask the baby girl to look. (182 words)

I am running from some guy that's powerful and sexually interested in me. I hide and run through the trees, up dirt roads, and finally I abandon the car and run on foot. I go through a corn field, eating some corn. I'm tired and figure I've lost him so I lay down to sleep a few hours. A man comes to me and says, "You can rest for awhile but then you've got to leave because people are always hiding in here and my mother will run a combine through here at dawn and she will do it, so you'd better be out of here before then. She even knows which part of the field everyone usually uses! OK?" I agree. I rest and then get up and continue running. There are more houses now and I then see a sandy beach to a river. Across the river is modern buildings, a hospital. I see people putting on muslin sheet robes and going into the river to swim. I think about diving in, but someone says, "You have to brine first." It's a cleansing, healing river and the sheets have brine in them. You have to go to the hospital and get the sheets first. I see a man floating in there, both his hands bandaged. I continue on my journey. (222 words)

A woman keeps getting alien babies. She brings them in one at a time and hands them to me. I look at their faces and try to find something to feed them. Two of them look alike and I call one "Doctor" and the other "Doctor," only I mean Philosophy. There are at least nine of them. The last one is quite large and she gives me some salad and hamburger to feed it with. I say, "Solid food, already?" I don't think that's a good idea. I spoon it in and he spits it out. I try corn, pork and beans, etc. Nothing works. I tell her we need some cereal or milk. I also tell her we need to give back some of these babies. I see an alien store and enter it to get the right food for the baby. She (now Jennifer H) gets hysterical and screams and cries. I yell at her, "Shut up!" She shuts up and is angry at me. A pause develops and I feel embarrassed and try to explain how we need to work with the aliens to help the baby. She calms down and then some people come by that want some of the babies and they take two of them wrapped up in one blanket. I am worried we should talk this over with Jennifer H first. (228 words)

I'm telling this woman how to set up the name file, I think, We're in the Sheridan house and she's going to help me out with my secretarial duties. She prefers colored papers and I say I'll get some for her later, but first I show her this book. First she has to look up the name of the place, Vincent Hospital. I can't find it at first, but I keep looking and I find it. "Then," I say, "I look up my own name because I know I'm on the list. I see 'Sanders-29.' That tells me to turn to page 29. I do so and see 'Sanders-1-1-2'. That tells me where the list is." She agrees to do it. Now, we're in an old rickety house and this woman, a man, and my brother Dwight are going to help me build it up from the falling down, ugly condition. I point to a solid rock wall and the man says, "It will be easy to build a staircase in it." I say, "But for why? Where would it go?" He decides to build a fireplace. He's painting the kitchen in the "bar" room. He sees that we have a lot of kitchens. I say, "Well, we need them. This one, in the bar room will be used for the customers. The center one will be for family and the one outside for the cattle hired hands in the summer when we raise 100 head of cattle." The house is built into a mountain and under a huge cement bridge. The country is too rough to graze cattle. The house keeps improving. It's starting to look good and solid. (see drawing) (282 words)

A long dream with Uncle Joel and Aunt Jillian. I meet my parents in a restaurant in Dover. It looks familiar. We've been there before. I'm in Joel and Jillian's house, lots of glassware. I then watch Joel on a river boat. He's chasing a young woman and then has an epileptic seizure. I watch his face and think, "I love to watch his face." It's a sweet face, but then he wants me to say we are together so people won't know of his affair with this woman and I say haughtily, "I'll read my diary, if he was there, it will be in my diary." I realize my diary and journal could be an embarrassment to me if people read it. I walk past a field of corn, touching the plants as I walk by. Then I'm near an empty field on a mowed down path and the sky is brown. The clouds are roiling around and I'm scared. That is the worst storm sky I've ever seen and I could get struck by lightning, out in the open like that. I keep walking fast, hoping to find safe cover in time or to somehow avoid the storm.

I'm in an old run-down house. The floor boards of my bedroom are rotted through and a hole is developing. I'm in bed near a stairwell. I realize some of the clothes on my floor have slid down into the hole. I wonder where my father is. He could fix the hole. I reach for the clothes and slide into the hole myself and fall under the house in a horrible pile of debris that is rotting away. I feel fear that I will rot with it. I fight my way back up into the house and walk down the hall asking where everyone is. Dwight is in his room, the furthest one away. My mother's in her room. I'm near the front door and a monster from hell comes at me. I am very afraid but stand my ground. I grab its tongue at its roots and pull, even though I know he'll bite me and it will be terribly painful. I poke his eye with a stick and drag him out of the house. He's unconscious and I crawl back to the house with a match. I light the carpet on the porch, wondering if I should go in first and get our possessions, but it is more important to torch it at once. I light it. The monster comes at me, but is consumed in the flames. I look to make sure all my family is safely out of the house. One is missing and then I see her - Dwight, Jake, my mother, my father, Charla and me. We walk down the road and I say, "Are we homeless? And we don't even have a car to live in." [BL] (283 words)

A young man wants to go on a date with me and I am interested but still have the old fears, but I agree to go. I get into the little red car. I'm in the passenger seat. It's a tiny, foreign car. He drives right on the edge of the road which is a dropoff to a river. I peer over the edge and say how pretty it is, the water eddying like that, but get scared because he's driving so close to the edge. So I can see that we are in danger. I glare at him. Then he makes the car jump over a gap over the river, like the car is a horse. We are successful; then he does it again only we don't quite make it and the car hits the water right at the edge. We crawl out and he's embarrassed. I kneel down and sit beside him, amazed I can do that. He moves away from me, embarrassed. I wish to comfort him. Two men come over to get info on what happened. I call him Charlie/Howard (184 words)

I insult my creative writing teacher by calling him Ron. He corrects me, his name is Rod. He leaves and I go outside to see huge boulders falling out of the sky. I run as best I can to the safety of the building, like a school. I go inside. These things are seed pods from outer space (aliens). They crash through windows and so on. (66 words)

They come down the stairs and I wait, hoping the police get here before these guys find me. The police arrive and I'm safe, but desolate because my people are all dead. (71 words)

Some guy brings in a box of groceries we supposedly ordered. I laugh and say, "Oh no. We ordered Rye Crackers, not Rye brand dog food. We don't even have a dog. But, I'll accept this steak and porkchop." A man comes out and says, "No, we didn't order that either." I say, "Yes we did. I heard you do it." "Not this steak," he says and gives it back. "Trust me," he says and I shrug, letting go of the meat. We go back into the house and the guy starts kissing me. I like him where I hadn't before. He's the cook and has a spray of potato juice on his face. [BL] (114 words)

I decide I'd like to try gambling and go to a table where Aunt Naomi is. I feel hesitant; we're not supposed to gamble. It's wrong, somehow, but I'm intrigued and curious, so Naomi gets me my numbers, all written out on a piece of paper. She bought it for me. Then I see Grandpa Lloyd coming to sit next to me. He's got double chins and he's wearing a turquoise and black striped turtle neck shirt under his suit jacket! I'm quite surprised. I call him Lloyd. Then Uncle Wilbur comes over also. They are gambling! Now it's time to start, but I can't find my paper with my numbers! I search everywhere, my purse, etc. and can't find it, then I realize Naomi took it. She paid for it after all, and she's gambling with it. Then there's this guy with a gun. He's a demented killer and I'm afraid of him, but somehow drawn to him as well. I end up protecting him when the motorcycle police come up and point their cannons at me. A sergeant says to another one, "What's the matter with you? Your light on the gun isn't on." I'm amazed that the killer jokes the police. It works, though. They don't get suspicious and leave. He then is waiting for his train and starts digging in his suitcase for something. "You'll miss your train," I say, feeling afraid he will and then I'll still be in danger, and afraid he'll go because I'll miss him. He wants my address. He hands me a paper to write on and he says, "Fourteen women have known I kill and yet they've felt sorry for me, or liked me and have protected me." I write my correct address down, even though in my mind I'm thinking, "You fool, now he can come back and hurt you." I see the train coming; it's lit up and goes like the Ferris wheel (round and round). He leaves. I feel relieved and sad. I see Cher and Sandy, who I thought had left Paris. They are surprised to see me. I tell them I've decided to stay for awhile but don't have a place to stay. Do they have a couch or a sleeping bag? They say, "Sure, no problem." I go to their place, which is like the inside of a train car, long narrow benches, etc., and sit, waiting, for them to come in. A woman is sleeping on the bed. (415 words)

I'm looking for Melissa G (really Clare K). I go to her mother's house and look into the kitchen window. Her mom is doing dishes. She tells me to wait at a campground. I go there and see her mom driving her kitchen over to me. I'm quite impressed! It's a mobile unit that she unstrapped from the house. I get in, it's cute, wooden and we drive back to the house. I go in and see large windows. I look into the toy room and she says, "Go ahead, go on in." I go in and look around. I see ceramics she's made on the wall. Some have price tags and I think about buying some. I see a wood stove and a kiln. I say, "Oh is this a kiln where you nest the wet clay mold into the embers and cook it?" She says yes, then, through the windows I see Clare, red fluffy feathers. She's pretty and she's annoyed with me for being at her mom's. I explain, then I hear a small black-haired baby girl in pink crying. I pick her up and rock her, singing, "Sugar Baby" over and over. The mother of the baby is annoyed. I didn't ask permission and she sings a different song, "Sug--" a short version of Sugar. I match her song! Then I have to remember I have a meeting tomorrow with Melissa G and repeat that over in my head. Clare tells me, "It's just a van," when I comment on her mother's interesting kitchen. (258 words)

I'm at the M City house and I'm in my wheelchair at the road edge, watching cars zip around the bad corner. I see Amber walking by with another friend. I wish to see Darryl and concentrate hard. Sure enough, he comes walking up the street to my house. I get out of the wheelchair and, therefore, I'm invisible to him. My spirit surrounds him like a cloud and I think at him to stay here for a while, "Don't go away." He goes to the house and I look for my wheelchair. Dwight has moved it to the back door and I go get it and come in through several unfinished rooms. In one room, several straight back chairs are turned to the wall. I get to the living room and my parents are there. I say, "Oh, you took out the fireplace. I loved it." Then, I see it's on another wall. Darryl knocks on the door. I open it and wonder how he'll feel seeing me in a wheelchair. He seems accepting. We hug. I'm glad to see him again. (183 words)

I'm in a swimming pool. There are seals and an octopus in there. At first, I'm a little afraid of the octopus, but they all come to me and I learn to love them. They are sweet, loving creatures who look at me mutely with soft, big, moist eyes just radiating love and need for love. I stroke them on the head and pet them. They love it and need it. I get out of the pool and one creature follows me. He is tiny and so needy. His name is Tom. He curls up on me and I pet him and soothe him. He's so small and needy. At one point he's lying on my thumb and gets absorbed into my skin. At first I am concerned, but then I realize he needs that nourishment from my body. He later comes back out, large and more happy. Now I'm a teacher in a rural, small, one room high school. It is graduation day. My class is seated on the bleachers and I stand before them. I am touched by their beauty, intelligence, loving natures and creativeness. I give them a speech. I say, "I know you are feeling sad at leaving your dear friends of four years. I too am feeling sad, for never have I seen such a loving, creative, intelligent, beautiful group of students. If you are the typical graduating class, then this world will be blessed and things will change. You go out each of you, melded with your friends. A piece of them lives in you now. So, bless you, and good luck." I begin crying. Someone shuts the door on them as soon as they are out, but I open the door again and continue my grieving of their departure. Then I stop crying and feel peaceful and loved. (305 words)

I am approaching a barn, it is old, dilapidated and ugly. Inside is darkness and rotting, stinking stuff that I am supposed to clean up. I don't want to, and as I am walking to the door, I veer away, deciding not to do it. I then walk across a grassy pasture to a muddy embankment. I accidentally slip and fall, sliding down the embankment to a muddy area that is like quicksand. I am flat on my back and sinking, trapped and I know there is no way out. I am as good as dead. My sister Lydia is with me and she is already below the mud line. I see she is still alive because her eyes open and shut. It is almost time for me to go under. I feel fear and resistance, but I don't panic. I go under and am amazed I can still breathe. A wash of water goes over us, rising us, floating, out of the mud. We crawl out onto the grass. Then we get up, hugging each other and walking toward our house, which is around the left side of the barn. There are a series of Quonset huts like married student housing at OSU. The first one on the left is ours. It is old, the paint is peeling. I open the door and walk in. I see a blue cotton print dress on a dress form and I say, "Hi, Mama." I realize it is a symbol of my mother. I see movement in the bedroom, my "father" is sick and old and in bed. I don't want to go in, but I do. His face is bumpy and old-looking. He says to me, "I have no sons, so you will be my boy, Buck Bucko." [BL] (297 words)

Helicopters. I am a whiz pilot. A man is impressed and teases me by flying close as I was water-skiing in a river from my 'copter. I get back in my 'copter and call headquarters, identifying myself as Lieutenant. I complain about him endangering us, and then have to do some fancy storytelling to explain how come I am playing around water-skiing! I start flying the 'copter, through the city. I am especially good at precision flying. I go under bridges, through tunnels and over and under wires. Then I go up in empty sky, but it's not as challenging. I see another plane and a 'copter. He's in the 'copter. I realize I'd better keep a sharp eye out to not smash into other aircraft. I then land. He wants to fly with me and I invite him into the 'copter, telling him to fasten his seat belt, and to not touch anything! I get out, checking the water, oil and so on and get in and we fly. He likes me and starts kissing me. It is very pleasant and I sit in his lap and we neck. We suddenly hit a swarm of birds that foul up our props and we start to dive. I see a body of some man falling out of the sky and listen to him scream as he realizes he'll soon smash into the ground, experience terrible pain and then die. I feel sorry for him and empathetic. It's the same feeling as watching myself being suffocated by the mud in last night's dream. We crash, but thanks to my skills we are uninjured. We get out and see a large rock cave that looks like a closet. There are suits and dresses hanging in it. I wish it to be a regular cave, and it is. Then Jay, an acting student, comes by and asks permission to use our bathroom and says he hopes we don't mind, but Josh is with him. I do mind, but shrug my shoulders. (338 words)

A married woman who looks a little like me and whose hair feels like my mother's has suggested we make love. I feel uncomfortable, but also sexually excited, and I get into bed with her. I turn over on my side, with my back to her, thinking it would be better if we sleep first and then make love after we've rested. Actually, what I'm doing is avoiding it. So she approaches me and I shrug my shoulders and turn to face her. I can barely look her in the eye. I feel slightly disgusted and apprehensive. As she starts to take off my several layers of night gowns, I feel very excited, and then a younger woman comes into the bedroom through a skinny door by the bed. She glances at me and then says, "They're here." She goes to another door and opens it up. Several young, good-looking men come in and more women come in. These men are prostitutes. Her husband let them in. The woman goes to them and in a very business like manner. These people couple up, the man behind like he's riding a horse. They're all grunting and pumping. It's a pure sex act. I'm embarrassed. One guy comes to me and acts like he'll do me next. I say, "No." The woman whose bed I'm in is annoyed and disgusted with me. What a weenie! So she goes to the men and they're all going at it. I'm still sexually excited. I lay in the bed waiting for it to be all over and she returns so we can continue. Someone brings me the Visa bill to sign for my part of the festivities. I almost sign and then decide that since I didn't partake, I didn't have to pay. The woman heard this and glared at me. She's really disgusted with my wimpy behavior. I want to leave, but feel some obligation to wait and continue with plans as they originally were. (331 words)

I am now on a rocky hill. I see a white furry object and wonder what it could symbolize. I answer myself by saying it symbolizes mountains and ridges of anger, lots of anger. I agree that anger is important in my background. I see a group of people down on a beach, making love. I decide to go down there. I look for the path. Someone says, "Careful, it branches out and you could get lost." I go anyway and it's pretty much a straight path through the rocks. I get there and see Tyler walking beside me. He doesn't recognize me. I laugh and say, "I'm B." He is startled. I soothe him by saying, "It's easy to not know because I'm walking." I choose him and we make love. I'm glad it's someone I know and like. (140 words)

I am a black, tanned woman, healthy and strong. I am standing naked in a single file line with an equally good-looking, healthy man right behind me. We both have pale butts from the loin cloth we usually wear. Someone says, "Uh oh, a," meaning a terrible thunderstorm or something is coming. He says, "Let's leave. We walk away quickly. I say, "Wait, won't we be deserters? Won't they shoot us?" "Yep," says the guy. I hesitate and then join them. We find a huge river and start to walk across. "Look," says the man and I see how huge and powerful the river is - huge rapids, smashing over cliffs and rocks. Two small dogs walk out on a protruding rock and I think, "They won't last long, poor things." Then the man says, "Let's move the bridge until it's over the falls so we can see it better." I am incredulous. We'd be killed. It's an adventure to him. He challenges me, grinning. I agree, but feel scared. I and another woman are at one end of the bridge, the men at the other end. We are to pull the ropes by hand that will move the bridge downriver and over the falls. I call him over to show me how when one rope screams through the pulley, how to make sure the next rope is ready to be picked up. I point out how some ends are frayed. "No problem," he says happily, "perfectly normal." I point up to a roll of toilet paper I've put in a safe place so that when I get scared "shitless" I'll have it handy. He laughs and says, "You aren't afraid, are you?" I say, "Oh no! I'll just throw up when we're over the falls." And then we let the ropes go, they burn and sing with the power of the river pulling us. The falls are thunderous, the white water smashing at us. We are caught. We fight and somehow pull ourselves back out, exhausted, hands raw from rope burns and victorious, the back waters still boiling and misting, the thunderous white water a softer sound in the distance. We are victorious. (364 words)

I am an incredible swimmer. I dive off a diving board with such strength and grace, a triple somersault, and I dive clean and deep and hold my breath for long minutes and come up out of the water so powerfully, I literally can walk on the water and easily step out onto the pool's edge. I am impressed. So is a man who has some power and fame. (69 words)

(naptime) A man and I are going to paint portraits of people. He's an artist and very good, but I can see people more deeply. And even though my pictures are more primitive, they "say" more. I am picking up my pile of pictures and things I'd done before as a child and young adult. I see a cat cut out of poster paper. My mother comments on how cute it is, and how well I can draw, in a surprised tone. Now the man and I are doing portraits of a woman. I make quick, dramatic strokes and come up with an interesting, arresting picture. I use black paint. I see her between two men in the portrait, so I'm painting her relationships I just "somehow" know about. She likes the artist's rendition better. Now the group wants to go on a scenic river raft ride. We get into two boats. We are on a street, not the river, and then we turn right and peek through a narrow opening at a raging river. I say, scared, "This one is too big for us. This isn't the right river." But we choose to go anyway, even though we can't see around the bend and we can hear the thunder of the falls in the distance. And then it's too late, we ride the river right up to the edge of the falls and manage to park on the flat land edge, safe, but it doesn't look like we can get back home without help. I get out of the boat and I interrupt a man and a woman talking and I feel guilty, but I also say, "I need a hug." He looks at me blankly and then lightly hugs me as he continues to talk to the woman. I ask several others for hugs. They just stare at me blankly. I feel rejected and alone and sad. (319 words)

I see an old friend, a warm, friendly man, one I met when I just started at the community college. His voice is warm and caring (like Nat V). I can't remember his name. He comes up to me and asks how I'm doing. I am interrupted by a boy doing some tricks with a small wagon/car. The wheel is turned and won't work right. He's on stage and is embarrassed and says, "What shall I do?" in a stage whisper. I walk around on stage being like a rodeo clown, a distraction. Then my friendly man comes back over and hugs me. We walk together for a block or so, his arm around my waist and mine around his. It felt so good and comforting. I missed it. We talked. I told him about my book. "Oh, still trying to get that published," he says. "You need a job!" He says, "I'm retired." I say, "But a few odd jobs to make extra money would be nice." I remember his name is Nat Cathran. I like him very much. (180 words)

I'm in a small boat in the huge ocean. I'm lost and drifting. A huge Navy ship comes over and a military officer who looks like Paul Newman comes aboard and finds me. I'm nearly dead from lack of food and water. He asks me how much food I had left and I point to a few scraps. I feel superior because I know I'm not a goner yet. So resourceful! He brings me on board the ship. I go to his "office." Someone has projected his face up on the clouds and is throwing a ball (soccer) up at him. His hands move clumsily and can't catch the ball. This is supposed to prove there is no God, and if there were, he isn't it. This is damaging to him. He must find the culprit. I know how, but he won't believe me, so I and another woman take over. We call the accused in. I tell him he must sit facing all of us for 3/4 of an hour. The crowd groans because they figure it's a waste of time. I shorten it to 1/2 hour and tell him how if he plays games with us and waits us out, it will go bad at the trial. He will have proven his guilt. Then as he sits there, I explain how it is best if he just tells us the truth. What he doesn't know is that I and the other woman are psychic and are taking notes on his internal responses and we know the whole story. (260 words)

Magical grandparents look like ordinary older people, but they are really magical godparents, but cast under a spell. I come to their house and they show me around. We go out into the backyard and walk. I start singing because it is so beautiful and I sing beautifully. I sing, "Oh, Lord, look at these beautiful mountains." We walk across the yard, which is iced over rain water, and I'm worried it will crack and we'll fall through. She says, "No, no problem." We safely get to the other side. There is a sort of children's fantasy playground there and I go in and look around at the cute playhouses and things. The older woman gives me a huge pink crystal on a necklace and I wear it. As I'm going through the playground, it changes to a deep ruby color and I find a big black crystal that pops up out of a "playhouse." That means the spell is broken and they are restored to their magical selves. (169 words)

I am a self-centered, arrogant woman. A man follows me around being angry and sarcastic. I get into the driver's seat of a van and start to drive. I'm going the wrong way and look for a break in the median bushes so I can make a "U" turn. I see one, brake hard and barely make it; now I'm in the fast lane, going the right way. I'm trying to change lanes to the "slower" lane and see ahead of me a tiny baby (one day old) on a tricycle pedaling along, keeping up with the flow of car traffic. I change lanes and so does she and we collide. I pick her up, concerned. She's not hurt, but she's feisty and annoyed with me for getting in the way. She's wearing a pink suit and a red light flashes near her chin. She's sort of an alien high tech baby doll/person. I feel a rush of concern and love for her and pick her up, and now I'm taking care of her. The angry man smiles and croons a sweet happy celebration song because finally this selfish, self-centered woman he's been in love with and waited for all these years is caring for someone else. That means soon she'll wake up to him and return his love. He is very happy. She just looks at him like he's being silly and comments to someone that he's doing some "silly male mating ritual."

I am in a graduation gown. It is necessary to drown and then be saved or come back to life to fulfill this ritual. I am very afraid to do it. But Theresa needs me to do it to help her daughter. I call out to God/spirits for help. A bolt of lightning comes to me, runs over my body and back out my gown, from the thighs and groin area. I see this as a powerful sign. I am capable, I can do it, I am special. I go to the pool. Theresa and I hold hands. I see Charla already lying, not breathing, like she's asleep on the bottom. I feel sadness. I am also afraid I won't be as brave. I jump in and immediately panic, fighting for air. I can't surrender to it like Charla can. I wake up gasping. (144 words)

A glue substance touches me and spreads over me, covering me, it is aflame and I'm being burnt alive. It is frightening and painful. Two women want to help, but it would mean their death and so they back sadly away. I am paralyzed with the moment. (47 words)

I am given an old grocery/vanity store. I enter it to inspect what I have. I see lots of aisles and stuff, a bit old and dusty. I see a glassed-off showcase room on a side wall. I can't find the door, then I find it and have to move a desk aside to get in. There's lots of stuff. And then I see a high shelf or attic area and look up there. I see beautiful silver things - bowls, jewelry, treasures worth something. I think, "I'll not mention it to anyone just yet." I go back out to the main grocery area. Then I go upstairs and see on a table plastic bubble packets of the Native American religion. I pick up and open it, noticing the two round places where the Peyote buttons (two of them) were supposed to be and weren't. It had been opened already. I read the booklet and saw two headings, "The Lazy Man" and "The Ultimate Man." They were descriptions of archetypes like "The Wild Man." Then someone puts the packet on a cart and I am concerned because I felt a strong connection and didn't want it taken from me. I look at my hand and am amazed to see my fingers are straightening out! I push and stretch my hand muscles and can feel them stretching and straightening until my fingers are now beautifully straight. I am in awe and know its because of my connection with that packet. I say to someone, "Did you see? Look at my hand." The person says, "Do you want people to notice?" I agree that maybe I don't. People will read about the freak in the National Enquirer. I start to go downstairs. A Native American medicine man with glowing amber sunglasses like Mitch's says to me, "You must learn from the packet and then come back and teach me." I find that amazing because I perceive him as knowing and powerful. [Earlier in the grocery area I was saying we should get signs up and drum up business. A woman said, "What's the hurry? Why don't you do inventory first and see what you have."] (329 words)

I am captive. A mean, horrible man, his wife and sons torture me. I am tied up and forced to have sex. I'm injured and hurt frequently. I can only go to the bathroom when they want me to. I am tied up to a pulley and pulled up off the floor by my hands. I must pee on command in a bottle. I am terrified of this horrible man who would hurt me just for the heck of it. I am totally helpless and trapped. The wife complains because he's a man so he gets all the best chances to hurt. She's sort of an enabler for him. A young man, a son, weakly protests at the cruelty of the father. (122 words)
Barb Sanders:#1699 (09/01/90)

Now I'm a passenger in a car. The son of the horrible man is driving. A woman (perhaps Darcy) is behind me. We have escaped with the help of the son. We must constantly be moving in a random way so "he" won't find us. We meet him several times and he grabs my leg and I panic. I pull away but it's hard as I'm not very aggressive, mostly afraid. We can never stop. It is merely another form of torture that will go on forever. (87 words)

The wife sees me and begs me to get caught again for her husband's sake and I refuse and run. I see the man and remember that I could call the police. I dial 911, shaking in fear. I say, "Help, this man will hurt me." The police at first refuse to help, pointing out to me that he's my father. I say firmly, "You will help me anyway. He hurts me." They agree and take him away.

Lucy and I are in a house. Justin, her husband and Lorne, her ex-husband are there. I beg her not to pay any attention to Lorne. He's like a milder form of that horrible man. She struggles with her indecision and then agrees. We slam doors shut against him. We then begin to go upstairs. The stairs are ornate, cloth brocade and appliques. I point out several lovely rooms. One entirely gray bedspread, drapes, wall paper all match. Then the stairs are bright red with a soft pink accent. I tell Lucy about it. We reach our rooms, which are on the top floor. There isn't much furniture and the rooms aren't as pretty as the others. We are disappointed and think about returning to the lower floor. Justin is with us. (132 words)

I am shocked and sad. Howard's arm got amputated in an accident last night. I am carrying his dead arm around for him. I sit on a couch next to a man and feel the heavy dead weight of Howard's dead arm across my shoulders. I pull it off and behind me trying to ignore it. It is in the way. Jerome is around and I am attracted to him. I need to pack things up and put them in my van. He offers to help. I agree. He goes and I decide to change clothes so I'll look more attractive to him, but it doesn't work because I look pudgy, overweight. I'm getting tired of dragging around Howard's dead arm and besides it's getting rank by now, rotting. A woman says she put her dead father in a box. I open it and look. The father is still alive, with white hair. His eyes move. I feel sorry for him and help him out of the box. Howard, with a missing arm, comes to the door. (177 words)

I am in bed with Howard again. It's been so long since we've made love and he wants it real bad. I agree. I lie down and try to pretend I'm asleep. I am turned away from him. He slowly and gently comes close to me. He's afraid I'll pull away or refuse him and so he's being very hesitant and careful. He licks my cheek. I feel some revulsion. He touches my nipple. I want to cringe. I try to tolerate it but can't, it is so repugnant to me. I sit up, crying and sobbing. He is heartbroken and runs from the room. I feel such sorrow for him, for me and for my two baby girls (Dovre and Ellie). I'm not intimately, lovingly close to them as I'm not sexually there for Howard. I feel like apologizing for this deficit in me. I get up and find a note Howard had written for me. He had gone to bed to wait for me and left a note to explain that. It said, "Here are your pills (birth control). They are improved and better than the last time you tried them. I'll go to bed and wait until you feel ready." (203 words)

I'm in a house. A noise or light in the room sets off an orgasm and I'm sitting on a couch. Other people are in the room, a man, maybe Chuck. I put a magazine up by my face, pretending to read it so no one will see my face and I try not to respond to the strong orgasm so no one will know this is happening. I'm embarrassed. Then I hear electricity zapping in the next room. A cord is lying in the water. I am aware this is dangerous and am leaving the house so I'll be safe, when I see a small girl child bend down to pick up the zapping cord. She's standing in the water (Charla/Dovre) in a dress. I yell, "NO! NO! Don't touch that." I'm frantic. She pays no attention to me and picks it up. I must stop her, but to return and get her will endanger myself, but I must. I'm yelling at her as I rush in, grab her hands and pull her out. I'm amazed there are no burn marks on her hands. She seems unharmed. I rush out of the house, carrying her, looking for the fuse box. Others try to help me. I push them aside, they are in the way. I find the box and don't know which way to push the switches and ask, "Is this the on or off?" I turn them all off, one by one. Now I feel sad, the house is dark, the food will spoil, it will be cold, because there is no energy, but at least we are safe. (271 words)

A young boy is curious about kissing. He wants to know what it will feel like. I/myself/his mother, decide to kiss him myself to show him.

I am standing on the mud flats looking for the ocean. I'm up to my ankles in mud. A male, soft, sweet and gentle, almost a spirit, stands to my left behind me. I ask him where the ocean is. He smiles and points forward. I see a slit in the land, like the birth opening on a whale. Two "people," one male and one female, are together in a circle, the woman coming up through the slit like a flower growing (see drawing). The man smiles and says, "Ah, you have seen the infinity holes." I ask again where the ocean is. He points and I get ready to dive. I remember I won't be able to breathe. He smiles again, walks up to me and French kisses me. It is so gentle and caring. I realize he's given me the "kiss of breath." Now I'll be able to breathe underwater. I dive and find myself in a narrow channel full of murky, deep water filled with a swarm of naked swimming people. It's a school of fish. I swim among them comfortably. (184 words)

I'm at a beach and trying to take photos. I can't get the right composition. It would look good and then change. I see statues dancing. I try to take a photo with mountains in the background, but they shift. I go back to my friends on the beach. A nice man, the boyfriend of my friend, is very supportive. I like him but he belongs to the other lady. He's smiling at me and I turn and see Howard standing there and my smile just disappears. He wants to be interested in my photography too, but I walk away. I don't want anything to do with him. (108 words)

A male dictator, overweight, kind of looks like Jared, is killing the Jews. Frank Sinatra and I are underground agents. He pretends to be a Catholic priest so the soldiers will think the Jews are Catholics. We work for their safety. The dictator is very angry at us and does everything he can to get us. We keep escaping and he keeps capturing us and tells us it's the last time. He walks out, grinning. We shrug our shoulders, grin and turn to escape quickly through a door. He'll never expect us to try so fast. We turn left and hide in a closet to fool the soldiers who expect us to run. Then we head for a ship. We're going up the gang plank, but it's hard and I'm on my hands and knees, my hands slapping the wooden ramp hard to gain purchase. A woman is getting off the boat and whispers to me as she passes, "Remember, your dreams are here to help you." I realize I'd been so busy living it, I hadn't had dreams or paid attention to them.

It's my birthday and I'm waiting for my family to get home from work. I don't know if they'll be making my birthday dinner or if I'll have to get it on my own. It's 6:15. I go to my father's workshop and see a gift he wrapped in newspaper cartoons for my mother. I see glue bottles and things I'd been looking for. I then go down the hall to my parents' bedroom. I open the door and hesitate, embarrassed, because they are in there and I might have surprised them changing their clothes. I slowly push the door open. My parents are talking to one another. Dwight is on the edge of the bed chatting with two ill cousins. One has a cigar and both lay on the bed fully covered, face and all, by a body cloth. They look like dead bodies. I apologize for interrupting. I'm now in my wheelchair and Dwight gets in my lap. We start going backwards, uphill to our neighbor's house because they are having the party there. I hesitantly put my arms around Dwight. I say, "I hope you are driving, because I'm not." He laughs. I hug him and we both hug. It feels so loving and sweet and I feel like it's been forever since I've felt that. I also feel guilty like we shouldn't be touching, much less feeling loving. Dwight says, "I've always loved you too much." I say, "You've always been my favorite brother." We get to the neighbor's house and we go in. A man and a woman are seated and the man says something about wanting to go out. I say, "Me?" I then see he's looking past me to the woman. She's unhappy because she doesn't want him. Both seem indifferent and ignore me completely. He's explaining how she can say no next time if she wants to. (315 words)

My father, my mother and I are on a tiny motorcycle. My father's driving and then my mother is behind him and I'm perched on the end, rather precariously. We are traveling over the mountains to M City and I'm concerned that I don't have any gloves. My hands will get cold and hurt. Oh, well, I can stick them in my pockets, but I know I'm going to be uncomfortable. The road is gravel and my father hits the gas too hard and the cycle's front wheel lifts up. I yell, "Let off the gas," annoyed and a little scared. He does and we go on. I have to keep telling him, because he's a bad driver and I feel endangered. Dwight is there somewhere. (126 words)

I meet this charming, sweet, young man who is magical. He senses what you want from him and then he creates it. A woman wants sweets and he magically produces them in quantity. I want to make warm, delicious love to him. He says he can only do that when there's TV around. I smile and point to my cable TV. "See? 24 hours a day," I say, quite delighted I'll have him all that time. I hug him to me, already anticipating the warm, soft, sensual good times. (89 words)

I am told I must drink deep of the river. I submerse myself and breathe in the water deeply. Small, white baby seals swim by. I stand up and a man comes by, taunting me, smiling. "You did the wrong thing," he said. "If you drink that water, you'll get dizzy and ill." I don't know who to believe, but I feel deep down to drink is the right choice. I look up river and see a life-size crucifix of Christ floating toward me. (84 words)

I'm walking across a field and see a muddy water puddle and realize I can choose to go around it. I do, but then I see the entire field and streets are covered with water, so I slosh through it down the road. I come to a brick fence and stop; looking over I see the ocean with lots of industrial things all over. I feel tired and sad because the whole world is ugly and takes over with industry. Then a fog comes up and I see a big seagoing ship with people on it going by. Then I'm talking to a man; he's telling me now I'm going to die. He says, "You'll get between a man and his wife and 'bang' you'll be shot or stabbed." I ask if it will hurt to die. He says, "Yes, a little, but it will be worth it because you will feel sooo good going home." I then feel a longing to "go home" (to heaven, or whatever). (168 words)

I'm in a play. I'm playing a male part. I have fake whiskers glued on. I am playing "The King of Israel." I walk to the stage area and stand on an empty stage. I know the throne is there, but I just can't see it. I'm waiting for the audience to be seated. A chorus is singing on bleachers between me and the audience. Open bleachers are near me at the front of the stage. Some people sit there in case I fall. I pace and then decide to start. I announce, "I am the King of Israel" and I place myself on the throne. Someone playing God's angel comes in and says, "God didn't say you could do that," and I said, "But I know He will" The play goes on. I worry if my false whiskers are going to fall off. (144 words)

I am a depressed woman and I decide to call Ginny up and go visit her so I can be alone and depressed in a safe place. I go there and decide to go outside and sit in the parking lot. As I'm there, now I'm pregnant. A large man comes by and threatens to rape me. I stand up, reaching for something to hit him with. He sees I'm prepared to fight and he ponders the odds of a 200 + lb. woman and a 300 + lb. man. He backs off. I go in, feeling scared, angry and frozen feelings. I tell someone about it. Then a teenager asks me if it's ok to teach my 3-year-old girl about sex and actually to make love to her. I feel uneasy, even though the person's logic makes sense. It supposedly would help the girl learn about sex. But finally I say, "I'm sorry, I just can't let you do it. She's too young. It could scare her or hurt her." (171 words)

I am the mother of Dwight, Jake and Ellie. I am very harried and frustrated. I'm trying to cook breakfast and I turn on a burner on the stove. I look again and see a pile of napkins on a burner starting to flame. I poke them and turn off the burner. I call out "Ellie" angrily. She left this mess. I see more flames and I see a bra burning in one deeply recessed burner. I try to get it out with a stick. The whole thing is a total mess. I then notice the stove is really a recliner chair, badly burned and charred. I turn to the sink to get a poached egg. There are egg shells floating in it, and filth is in the sink. I am disgusted and angry at my children. Jake is about to leave and I say to him, "If you don't put away the milk it will stay out and go bad and you won't have any for dinner." He ignores me and leaves. I feel angry and put upon. (179 words)

I'm taking a shower or bath. There are lots of free miniature things in a plastic bag -- tiny shampoos, soaps, irons, hem mending kits etc -- all one could use to keep things clean and tidy and comfortable. I don't use them and then notice I'm sitting in the tub on my towel. I don't even have a dry towel! I see I left soap on my face on the left cheek. (73 words)

I opened a huge package I had wrapped up and saw it was the "Life Monopoly" poster/movie I was sending to Dovre. I was tired and annoyed that I made more work for myself. I am too tired to wrap it back up, but I don't want to keep it any more and wonder if Dovre will mind storing it for me. I am bored and restless. I wander around and see a man I like, but I feel like I won't get him; he's in the distance. I feel like it would be nice to connect with him, but too tired to do anything even if I could figure out what do to. [BL] (114 words)

I'm holding on to a long hanging rope. I'm high up and scared because I may lose my grip and fall and be seriously hurt. I'm shaking with fear. There are three other ropes. A man is on each one. This is a man's thing we're doing. They are distant but encouraging. In a final rush of bravado I swing, even though the twisting makes me dizzy and disoriented. I swing myself up on a high perch and sit, proud of myself and "showing off" to the men. (88 words)

I am in bed and notice my wheelchair is far away in the next room. I'm surprised. Judy P comes over to talk, and I ask her to bring me the chair. She does, but I don't use it since I seem to be able to walk well enough at the moment. I'm embarrassed that I asked her to go to that trouble. She tells me a woman in the computer group sent her a complaint and shows it to me. Judy is wondering what she may have done wrong and lists a few things it might be. I look at the letter. It is a beautifully embroidered piece, nicely framed. Roses are embroidered around and with the complaining words. I admire her stitches and think about needlework and how the thread (yarn) crosses the corners as a diagonal. Each corner must be covered. (144 words)

My flabby breast is exposed. He wants to make love to me. I want to and yet draw back because of his young age. Later I am relieved I didn't act on my impulse and shame myself by making love to a child. (84 words)

It's a Sunday and I'm going to do a show tomorrow, so I'd better get ready. I eat caramels, which at first irritate my throat and I cough, but I keep eating them and get used to them. Each square candy has some information in it for the show. I'm going to lecture on Art In Spain. Each candy as I eat it creates like a slide show. I see one that shows the structure of a miniature house as it's being built. I'm glad because this will be good history to present in the show. I look for the number of that candy so I can find it again. I see two numbers. (see drawing). The first number is tied to a stick figure reindeer, so I choose the second number. I'm not prepared but it's time for the show. I feel nervous stage fright. Why do I keep doing this, I wonder? I go into the auditorium. There is a small crowd, maybe half a house. Oh well. I sit perpendicular to the audience and look at the stage. I see two red posters with words on it: my props. My mother and Ellie sit in the front row, in front of me, as I am actually facing the side of the audience (see drawing). My mother hands me folders of poems of a famous poet in case I want to quote him, to fill in time, or for contrast. Then the first act is on and my mother and Ellie are talking very loudly. I am embarrassed. Two black people, a man, standing and a woman sitting, are laughing loud and long. I think, "Uh, oh, tough audience." Then suddenly I can't see. I can't force my eyes open. I struggle and struggle, nearly panicked. I'd get one open a bit and be convinced things weren't where they were supposed to be. I saw the wheelchair I was sitting in, in front of me. I saw my own arm like it was up against my eye. (When I woke, it was.) I saw dry ice clouds and the four bright yellow and white machines making the fog to the right. I feel afraid and continue to try and force my eyes open. My mother stands up and walks to me. I say, "I can't see." She touches my eyes and examines them. She says there's a skin layer grown over the lids, holding them down (like scar tissue). She pulls it off. I can now see out of one eye occasionally. I still struggle. I say,"I guess I can't go on, maybe someone else can do my part, at least I'll be able to see the play I wrote." I feel frustrated and a little relieved (459 words)

I am doing a lecture on poetry. I have a fat book of different poets and a mimeographed set of pages of the ones I'll read and talk about, only I keep getting confused and have to keep looking the poem up in the text to see if it's the right one. The audience is getting restless. I'm embarrassed I keep apologizing, "I don't know why I am having so much trouble." I realize I should have just had the proper pages separated and marked. Somehow I know I did that, but It's not working anyway. A woman in the audience plays a guitar to keep everyone entertained. I am grateful to her and think, "What good thinking. How nice of her. How fortunate for me she did that." Names of the poets are Fred Mann, Locke, Sharp. A woman poet writes about children. The older man who is paying me to do the lecture suggests we take a short break. I am relieved because that will give me time to get it together. He's annoyed at me. I leave the room to find the bathroom. As I'm walking down a sidewalk, Darryl/Tom walks up to me. I feel a sad/excited feeling wash over me. He asks if he can talk to me as we walk. I agree and keep walking. He seems shy and hesitant. I know he's going to apologize and try to get back together with me and I want him to because I've missed him, and I don't want him to because he hurt me badly and he probably hasn't changed. He stands very close to me and I feel like I can't breathe well from need of his love. I back away. He follows. We are standing by a grand piano. I walk so that he is now facing me with the piano between us. He says,"I love you. I want to get together again. Is there any chance?" I feel like crying. I want to melt into his arms and hug him and feel loved. I keep repeating in my head, "Don't do it. Don't believe him." I say, "You hurt me so bad. I loved you and you went away. I was so lonely, even when I was with you." He is contrite and waits. I now continue walking to find the bathroom. He follows, hoping. I am torn. Now the older man, semi-bald, comes up and walks with me. He says, "Will you take a picture of me?" He hands me his camera, a (see drawing) slim, 35 mm camera. I say, "Sure." "You are so kind to do this." He smiles. He's in focus, but someone walks by and I move the camera, and now it's out of focus. I fiddle with the focus lens and the man says, "My daughter was raped." I gasp, "How awful" "Yes," he says, "Did you get her professional help?" "No," he says. "I'm a counselor," I smile, apologetic to explain my intensity. "I have a bias that people are helped by counseling." The man thinks about it, but I know he's not convinced. Several people are standing around, wanting to walk by, but waiting for me to take the picture. I get it in focus. The man smiles big and I snap it. We walk back to the lecture room so I can resume my poetry lecture. (563 words)

I'm sitting in the V. living room, watching TV and holding a guitar. I start playing with the music on TV and notice I'm doing pretty well. I look out the window. There is some ornate kind of thing out there that I was making. Some older man, semi-bald, was inspecting it. He wasn't too sure what it was. My mother comes in with the mail. She hands me two pieces. "Is this all I got?" I ask. "Yes," she says, putting an advertisement piece on the back of the couch. I look at the first envelope in my lap, a white one I'd sent a play script out in. The return address was "ugh revue." The stamps were placed randomly all over the front of the envelope. "Hum," I thought, "a rejection letter. Wonder how they worded it and if they have anything encouraging to say?" I feel OK about it because it was an inferior company, so it didn't matter anyway. The next envelope is an advertisement piece and I wonder if it's the same as my parents'. I see it's from "Business Manager" and realize it's not like my parents'. It has a rip (tried to spell tear/tare) in the front and I lift up the torn part and find a ball point pen with a writing end on both ends. A pencil is the same way, sharpened on both ends. I open a tube and at first think there's candy in it, but then I pull out one pretty red high heel shoe with a red and navy blue bow on the front. I like it and realize it's totally useless as is because it's only one shoe, not a pair. "How clever," I think. "How much insurance will I have to buy to get the second shoe?" The ad read something like, "Don't be half covered, get full protection." (314 words)

I see turkey and fixings in a microwave. Someone asks me if I had dinner yet. I say, "Yes, Ginny fixed me dinner." The relatives then start arriving for the reunion. I see Aunt Charlotte and invite her in. I ask her to really talk to me. She hesitates and then decides she will. We go upstairs. This is a three-story house, old but roomy house. The stairs are broad, wood, and sturdy. The square banister posts are large, beautiful and strong, as is the rail. In this room I see my father, Uncle Dudley and Dwight. Aunt Charlotte and I sit on a sort of couch. She says, "I'm not sure how much to tell you." I say, "Please tell me as much as you can. I want to know everything. You can talk about my parents. I was sexually abused, you know." She says, "I know." I try to formulate the question, "How and what do you know?" but the moment passes. She says, "Do you remember Uncle _____, a friend of Grandfather's (Lloyd) and our neighbor? He used to do this." (She demonstrates as she moves her left hand slowly and seductively from her hip down to her pubic area.) I am sitting in my white satin jeans, legs apart, and feel aware of my pose and change positions because Aunt Charlotte glances at my crotch area like I've done something seductive and wrong. I become aware of the other people in the room and say to Aunt Charlotte, "Let's go to my bedroom for more privacy to talk." She agrees and we leave the room. I realize that we'd just left my bedroom and say, "But this is my bedroom." I think about going to Dwight's bedroom and then we start walking down the stairs. My mother/Hasani/me is walking up the stairs and she says, "You're not going to let this rest, are you?" I say "No. I have 47 years of hurt. I must know so I can let go and release the pain (arthritis) and dance again." She says, "You can use my bedroom, next to the kitchen to talk." She hesitates and then says, "I can talk about it, you know, but it hurts so much." "I know," I say with empathy. Aunt Charlotte says, "Maybe we just exaggerate things." I say, "NO! That's what all the victims say." (396 words)

Theresa B and her family had to move. I am with them. We are all sleeping in the same bed. The husband and the children get up and leave and Theresa and I sleep in until 11:00! It feels great. I needed the rest. Then I wake up and yawn and get two cigarettes and light them both up. This is a rare treat, two cigarettes at once. I puff and puff. Theresa won't wake up; she's so sleepy. So even though I meant the cigarettes for her, I get most of them myself. Then Theresa gets up and goes out, leaving the door open. People are out there. I haven't any clothes on. I scramble for my bra and am annoyed at them for looking and at Theresa for leaving the door open. I feel exposed. (137 words)

Ellie and I went to a conference. We sleep together. I wake up and see Paulina, who had slept in her father's room, taking a shower. It looks like a good idea. I see a woman swimming past me, near the far wall. I'm surprised and wonder if there is water in the room. I sleep more. Paulina B gets into bed with me. I pretend I'm still asleep but enjoy the sweet hug she gives me. I hug her softly and pat her. She pats me back. I notice the difference between my feelings with Ellie and her. Ellie and I are always on edge with each other. Paulina and I exchange true feelings of loving each other. It's almost like she's my baby girl again. So now Ellie and I go to take a shower. The thing isn't very good. There are different nozzles and not much strength in the stream of water. Someone leaves the door open. A young teen boy comes in, rough and smart-mouthed. He has a scissor and threatens me. He rapes me. I have no feelings, even though I cry and sob and cry out, "help" and "rape." Later, I critique a story or movie about a mild man who has a water process to create steel. The macho men laugh, it won't work, they do fine with their fire and forge. Later, they learn this new method is better and have to back up and respect him. (245 words)

I am seated either in the driver's seat, or in the back seat behind it. Dwight was driving and he gets out to adjust something and doesn't put the brakes on. We start rolling and I call out to Dwight. Either I can't reach the brakes, or I don't think to do so, and we roll down a hill and finally crash into someone's garage wall. There was only minor damage to the wall and the red pickup. The man and his wife come out of the house. I recognize him as a local celebrity, perhaps a lecturer, author, or storyteller. Dwight offers to pay and hands him a fist full of change. He almost chooses an old silver dollar and then chooses two old and valuable pennies. We leave, walking. I tell Dwight he gave up too much. The damage was mild but the pennies were worth millions. I insist he go back and renegotiate. I think I'll help teach Dwight how to be assertive. Instead, I just take over and do it myself. I do it well, asking that he give back the pennies and receive recompense more at the level of the damage. He agrees. Then, a weird creature slithers up. It is a human male, but in the form and posture of an alligator. His human eyes are sort of on top of his head like a 'gator. We are introduced to this pet. He then hops on his tail and is now standing like a man on his feet. (254 words)

I'm at a conference of some kind, a motel. I have trouble locking the door of my cabin. I have trouble turning on the porch lights. I'm walking back to the main area. My cousin Abner, who I falsely call Nate, has a handmade guitar, a square board with three strings, one too loose to play. He hands it to me to play. I do quite well, singing a love song in a strong, clear, pretty voice. People like it. (80 words)

I see Andrea and two men at an exercise area. I'm getting ready to leave with someone, a friend, female. I say, "Oh, I want to tell Andrea. I'll just take five minutes. Go on ahead." I watch as the three line up to run a race. I am amazed how fast Andrea is. She wins easily. I call to her and start telling her how I used to have a box full of papers from my teaching year in another state. "That was a very hard year," I said. "I call it my memory box." I share with Andrea how good I feel now. I think I let go of the memory boxes. Then I told her about how I played my guitar so well with Nate, I mean, Abner, who I was going to marry when I was 6 years old. (143 words)

A child is playing. I watch and then step into the box she was using, and while in the box, standing, I pick it up, with me in it, and carry me into the house. The child is quite amazed I can do that. It felt smooth and easy. Now Grandpa Lloyd and a child are leaving. I get out of the box and go outside to wave goodbye. Grandma Mildred grabs me and starts dancing with me and I feel surprised that she would do that, surprise that she's not leaving with Grandpa Lloyd and frustration that she's interfering with me saying goodbye. I say, "Soon we'll go visit Grandpa." Aunt Esther is grumpy and says, "But it's 2:00 already, when will you have time?" I am annoyed and also realize she's right. I won't have time and I sigh, "Oh, well, some other time." I see my six uncles (one of them my father) playing on the lawn (sort of a leap frog or hide and seek game). My aunts are all on the patio/porch with me. Aunt Bridget looks pale and blonde. She asks if she got any sun. I look and see that her left cheek, as she faces me, is red with sunburn. I tell her. She says, "Good, some color." It used to be the fad to be white and pale and she was always afraid to get in the sun and made quite an anxious deal out of it. She's glad its not so now. I notice some golden brown tan spots and say, "You would look very nice tanned golden brown." (269 words)

Lydia has a restaurant and I'm helping her out. It's crowded and she's overwhelmed. I ask, "What do I need to do?" She says, "Wait on tables." I do. There is a snooty couple that I don't like that I wait on. Somewhere in the dream there is a baby girl I take care of. I change her diapers and talk with her. This is somewhere in the beautiful mountains, maybe in a Rocky Mountain state. I ask if the new train route can be got from S City, no, from the Coast, N City. Now it's near the end of the day, about 5:00 and I have a few "set ups" to do for reserved. special requests. The instructions are written on the placemats. The first is an airline pilot. He needs a glass of water at table 63A. He likes to be called by his name. Another is a couple who pay by Visa. I add up their bill and it comes to $1,000 dollars. We have to give $100 change and Lydia is concerned it's a scam with a bad Visa to get cash. Then I go to a young man's table. I lay down on the grass in front of it and hug the grass lovingly. This is a way of telling him I understand and accept his beliefs. He responds by hugging the meadow grass on his side. We talk. He asks me out, says he'd take me to town if I wanted, after work. I accept, and confess I'd like to see some of the tourist thing like the Paul Bunyan monument. He grimaces, but agrees. I have one more table set up, for a prom. Another woman says, "It's going to be hard." I take a pretty blue cloth that has velcro across the top and try to get it to evenly cover a board. It won't go on evenly. I keep trying. Then a blue pin (see drawing) [square] sort of a square (see drawing) triangle. It makes a hole in the lovely cloth. I feel frustrated. (344 words)

I am in a room with other women like a dorm sleeping room. One is very large with generous sized butt and breasts, an earth mother of the ancient type where cherubs were chubby and beauty had folds of fat. One woman helped me stand up and then went off to do something. I was upset and told her not to do that because I can't stand up very long before it hurts. A woman says to me, "I am not gay." I say, "Neither am I," feeling embarrassed as though I am "protesting too much." I continue to explain that I have enough trouble with isolation and being held apart because I'm different with disability. I sure don't need to add any more with being gay too! (128 words)

I am staying somewhere and everyday I go out and get a paper ticket on my car. I have to turn them in when I leave. Now it's time to leave and I'm packing, but can't find all the tickets. I hope that doesn't hold me up. I look at my left wrist and see long bunches of hairs (maybe 3" long) growing out of my wrist. I remark that's just like my mother and we compare our clumps of hairs. We soap them into "whale spouts" just alike. (89 words)

A tall many-storied building stands near a road. A construction crew is looking for a structural problem. I go into the building to the basement and I see a twisted place in a girder, a long beam. I come out and tell the foreman the building is about to collapse. We start running away and hiding in the bushes. I am next to the road and realize I must stop traffic because the building is going to fall on the road. I run onto the road yelling at the pedestrians to stop! Some ignore me and break past me, walking into the dangerous area. I see the building and actually try to visualize it falling because it isn't and I've got all these people stopped and they are annoyed at me. It finally collapses far away from the road. A person glares at me for hindering them. I shrug. Better safe than sorry. (153 words)

I find a business card that says "BLUE LENS." I wonder if it means the color blue on a camera lens or the Blues Music. I'm told its a special elite video crew that only records the top talents of that company and they are coming to record on video, me. I feel surprised and honored. So I go to the house and a woman/maid shows me my room. My little girl has a room down the hall. I'm supposedly getting the VIP treatment. I go in to "#23." It's a lovely room. It's time to take a bath, but first the maid shows me a tall, fancy French chest of drawers. In one drawer is a couch in case I have company. (high school friend Dora is in the dream somewhere.) Three drawers are full of pillows. One drawer has a green army blanket in it. Now the drawers open up like doors (French) to the bathroom. There is a fancy bathtub. I get into it. It's very narrow and tall, with black handled faucets. The maid fills the tub with water. I hope it doesn't go over my head when I sit, because the sides of the tub do. She offers to soap up my legs for me. I notice I have hairy legs. I choose to do it myself. (222 words)

I am in a house. I am renting it from high school friend Dora's mom and dad for $78.00 a month. Dora comes to visit and is impressed with the house. I say, "You should see how many toilets and kitchens I have." I take her on a tour and there are at least three separate apartments in the house, only it's all one house. The bottom rooms are lovely: two bedrooms, a sitting room, kitchen and bath (three toilets). A man tries to sneak out and I realize he's been living there on the sly. He asks if he can stay. I suggest he pay rent. "How much?" he asks. "$100 apiece," I say (he has a friend). I am very pleased with myself that I would get more money than I'm putting out and therefore make a profit.

A family Christmas gathering. I see Doug leaning over the face of an older, ugly woman, perhaps an Aunt. He's standing behind her and she's tilted back looking up at him. He drools on her face. I feel disgust. I am seated on a couch, but I am crouched or squatting behind my cousin Patricia. My knees are hugging her back. It's a friendly posture. I give Jake a box of 20 different colored felt markers. I watch his face. He's not pleased and I feel bad. He then opens my second present which is more of the same. I say, "I'm sorry, did I give you the same thing? I'll change it." He walks away, unhappy. I follow him and tell him I want to talk. Jake isn't interested, but I persist. "You're nearly 40 now and looking at your life, what have you accomplished? What time do you have left to do, what?" Jake scoffs and ignores me as he usually does. (164 words)

I'm in some cafe area. Danny Devito sits with me. I am interviewing him. He likes me and we joke back and forth. We are talking about dating. I say I just don't know how to "play the game," its been so long because I hate the game of it all. He wants to kiss me and makes a wiggly eyebrow joking about "squeaking" my breasts. I raise my hands in defense. We laugh. A whole lot of people are around standing, watching the interview hopefully. It's obvious we like each other and we are having fun joking back and forth. Finally says, "Let's kiss." I say, "OK, but don't rush it." This is important because if I don't like the kiss, I won't want a relationship with him and I don't want to ruin the chance because I do like him and I've been lonely for a long time. I want to have a relationship. So we kiss; it's not the best, but acceptable. The crowd cheers and one woman says, "I'm so glad she's finally found someone." So Danny and I talk long into the night, enjoying each other. Now we're married and I am sort of in Danny and sort of watching him. The woman/me is now Faye Dunaway. She's a total bitch. We live in the beautiful mansion, wonderfully furnished rooms, many stories high, room after room. Danny hides from me because all I do is yell, complain and speak in a harsh, angry voice. I am vacuuming. Danny and his male friend tiptoe past me going from room to room looking for a place to relax where she won't find them. Danny carries a tiny tabby kitten who is sweet, lively and curious. He/me pets the kitten. We are followed by the sound of the vacuum and her angry voice yammering. We go from room to room. We pause at the exercise room. Danny says, "She'd never come in this room," but we hear the relentless sound of the vacuum cleaner coming toward us. We accidentally knock off the handle and struggle, slightly panicked to get the door open. We do it and go on down the hall. We find an elevator but decide to use the stairs so she won't hear the elevator. We go to the roof area and get in a swimming pool. Danny lays down in the shallow water, his friend lays sort of on him, between his legs, both facing up like they were sunning. The pool is filled to overflowing with Japanese men. The kitten wants to wander on and Danny lets go of it and it goes on to play elsewhere. Faye Dunaway and her maid are standing in a window a story above the pool and looks out and sees Danny. Caught. Danny's stomach feels tight from "fear" or discomfort but he kind of gives up and continues sunning in the pool. Faye's face is full of hatred and anger. (493 words)

I am crying, sobbing. I feel enormous sadness. I'm leaving the man I love. His name is Jack Kennedy. He's very upset. I run from him and slam the door shut, struggling with the lock to get it locked before he pushes open the door. The lock is like an old one at M City House. He's hurt and begging me to open the door. I start packing my things. I pick up bouquets of flowers and toss them across the room in my sadness/anger. I pick up roses in green florist paper and realize I've got thorns in my left thumb and finger. It hurts and I cry as I try to pull out the thorns. Howard forces open the door and gently pulls out the thorns. (128 words)

I'm in a room, large, a sink on one wall, so maybe its a kitchen. I like this man and he likes me. There is a child, a girl. We love her. Mirabelle comes in. She's upset because of her blindness. I talk about my feelings about disability. She's complaining that people always over-help her. I agree. The man gently asks if he ever did that. I tell him yes. When we first met, he did some of the usual things AB's do around disabled people. I don't want to hurt his feelings. I finish the dishes. Then Mary and I sit on a table which is on wheels and we accidentally roll over to where the man is sitting. He introduces us to his wife, a pretty young woman with brown eyes and a pageboy hair cut. She's partially deaf and I hear it in her voice. I am surprised and sad that he's married. I say hello to her and we talk. (164 words)

I am in a play or movie. I'm playing a sexy slut, with a platinum blonde wig, a furry white bra, halter top, big boobs. I come on stage wearing a sexy dress over the sexy outfit. I'm waiting for my boyfriend. Another man, the "bad guy," sits near me and on the arm of the chair I'm seated in, curled up in a sexy way. He moves his hand to cause my dress to fall more revealingly to show more leg. Then he sits next to me, his arm now around me. He asks me to dance. I agree. He pulls me close. I see he has a large butcher knife. I have one too. We fight like swords fighting. I feel sad, but I must defend myself. I try to knife his balls. He dodges. He's a good-looking man. I'm attracted to him but he's clearly trying to get at my boyfriend through me. [BL] (156 words)

I'm at a high school or church, at an assembly. Everyone is sitting on wooden benches like in a church. A woman holds a huge boa constrictor snake which she has brought to show us. She wants me to touch the snake and get to know it, but I'm afraid to. So I start backing away. She follows me, insisting. I start to move among the seated students, ducking down so she can't see me. She just keeps coming. I run and hide, run and hide. I end up among the 7th grade girls, hoping she doesn't notice how much older I am, being a senior in high school. She smiles and says, "How young you girls look." I think maybe I should give up and touch the head of the snake, but can't get over my sense of fear which I now think is perhaps not warranted.

I'm helping out at a church. The pastor is busy and so I take a telephone call from a woman who wants a refill on her prescription. I ask where does she think she's called? She says, "Valley," the name of a pharmacy. I tell her she's got the wrong number. This is a church. Then I go to a room, where a few people and I are seated around a table. I'm taking my pills and get confused with my pink pill. It looks just like my "aspergum" pill only now the aspergum pill is larger, like a round piece of bubble gum with its name imprinted on it. I take my pills and then see more in a small dispenser cup. Confusion. A man says, "Oh, the four of us will be late," and I realize the church services are getting ready to start up. I wonder if maybe I will sit in, a sense of wanting to connect and I look in through the two glass windows. I'm in a rest or cry room and then there's another glassed-in room where some people are seated in pews. Beyond that is the crowded church area. I see the richly robed (red and gold) band and choir filing up to the front. The horn section (trombones) is moving their horns back and forth like a fancy 40's band or like "Chicago" or Herb Alpert band. The choir is already seated, doing hand jive moves to the song. I want to go join them and yet feel hesitant. I decide to sit in the back room, "cry room" and listen in. If it gets boring or dogmatic, I can leave. I have old, distant feelings of fear about sitting in a quiet crowd. I see a woman wearing a white hat with foofy flowers and netting. She's getting ready to sit down. (312 words)

A woman is in the passenger side of a car. She has lied and said she lives in this huge blue house. So the driver takes her to the house and is waiting to see how she'll handle this. The woman stalls for time but the driver waits, knowing she lied. Finally, a woman in the house notices the car and goes out to see what's going on. She thinks someone 's come to visit her. She says hello. The woman in the car brazens it out and gets out of the car and goes into the house with her as though they knew each other. Now we're inside and I'm the woman in the car. The woman of the house puts me to work. I start doing dishes and she tells me to make a casserole for dinner. I ask for a recipe and she says, "Just do the usual, use three groups of food." I decide it is necessary to do this work for pay for her hospitality. I don't like it much. Ellie and possibly Charla are there and I'm annoyed that she's not doing her share of the work. Now Hank comes in. I bring food into the living room to serve the guests and clean up. Hank is being uppity and ridiculing me. I get angry and slap him in the face several times. He's got a beard and a chubby face (like Howard). I tell him I don't like him. I drop some food on a pillow on the floor and sit to pick it up, trying to clean it up. Hank looks on contemptuously.

I'm in a restaurant, eating. I choose a vanilla cream pie. A line of auditioning actors line up. I go to join them and am shown a place to stand where I'll be out of the way. I think about protesting but let it go. Now I'm on a bus. A young, good-looking man named John is standing. He wants to dance. I go to him and offer to dance with him. I take his hand, the opposite way from normal. I am the girl, so my right arm should be out, but I take the lead with my left arm. I say in a way of explanation, "Oh well, it's my dream, after all." Then I change so he has the lead and I say, "I guess it is John's dream, really." We dance. I pull us cheek to cheek. He hesitates and pulls back slightly. He tells me a long, polite story. I say, "Well, I guess what you are saying is that I'm good looking for an older woman." He didn't want to hurt my feelings. I say, "I don't feel it. I don't like it, but it is true." I let go and walk to the front of the bus to watch the scenery. Several women and the male bus driver are singing. I join in, loudly harmonizing, showing off for John in the back of the bus. Suddenly there are bushes across the road. We drive through them, not even slowing down. But with a sense of shock I see that the road has suddenly ended in a huge lake and the bus is free floating through the air and crashes in the water. I say, "Open the door so we can swim out before we drown." The driver opens the door and we get out. Lucy is afraid. I reassure her. We paddle toward shore, which is close by. I notice the water is muddy and I then stand. The water is only waist deep; there is no danger after all. Then, someone says, "Look! A water fall," and they all go wading down the shoreline toward a thunderous, huge water fall. I say, "Oh, oh" because I will follow them and don't feel comfortable about wading in unknown muddy water. I could step in a deep hole and be in trouble, but I go anyway. Now it's a highway again that ends at a cliff edge that is glassed in. We stand and look down to see this waterfall. The people are in my way and now the glass wall is only 3' high and down a slope. I lay down on my belly and scoot in closer. All I see is an empty cafe with a sheet of water coming down the far wall. Pretty tame. I go up one level to see if I can get a better glimpse. This time the far wall is beautifully carved like natural rock formations in the form of two bear faces. I go up to the top level and still can't see the full waterfall. (511 words)

I just moved to a new town on the coast and I'm looking for a job. I go into this toy factory and step up to the receptionist's counter. It's quite ornate like a Rube Goldberg Machine. The woman looks down at me, unsmiling, and asks what I want. I ask for an application. A box full of folded papers slides down a tube. One application folds out like a paper flower and I take it. It has strange things on it, like it's a brochure for the toys. I realize that this is a wonderful series of jokes and I smile and laugh, just watching and enjoying. I am being watched by the older man, the owner of the factory. He approves of my attitude. He's been waiting, because most of the women get confused or angry and leave. He says to someone, "I'll make her my wife." He calls me in and gives me his proposition. We will marry but it will not involve sex, merely a marriage of convenience. I think about it. He seems a nice enough guy and agree. But then he changes his mind. I shrug and smile and say, "Oh well, is this the way I get back?" He is impressed that I take it so good-naturedly and don't demand money for the return trip home. I start walking back. He follows. I stop and look at the beautiful bay and the ocean. I admire a furry animal as it scurries through the marsh grass. I ask if this is an island and if that man has the only return boats. I find a "delivery service" building and go in to get a ticket. The man comes up to me. He's short, too short, I think, so I make him taller, but he's a few inches shorter than me. I shrug. It's good enough. He tells me, "The clock tells good time but it is always one minute fast." He made the clock. It never sold well. It has an ornate sculpture of the mountains and coast. I examine it and then pepper him with questions because I can see ways he can improve the clock and make it a better seller. He has, as usual, cluttered things up unnecessarily. He's very impressed with my enthusiasm, good sense and persistence. He decides he does want to marry me. Now we're in the back seat of his chauffeur-driven, black, older car. The window is down and we are hanging our heads but looking at the scenery as it goes by, almost like a dog does, the wind flapping in our faces. The man tells me that he has two brothers. I see one, Rod Taylor, good looking and young, and realize this will make a good story if I fall in love with him while I'm married to the older, duller brother. The man says the man his mother married wasn't the father of any of the kids. The mother went out and had three different affairs with strangers off the streets and had three different kids. The man she was married to raised all the kids as his own. Then my "husband" said, "I've only told 12 people this story and you're the only one I've told it all to." I nod and say, "I am honored." We have a grudging sense of caring and respect for each other. (566 words)

I am at a school as a guest speaker. A young man is also a speaker, We chat and pass in the halls as we go to our classrooms to speak. After we're done I'm going to leave and he says, "Do you want to eat one of those frank and cheese things they have for lunch? They're pretty good." I say, "Sure," hoping this means he likes me and wants to spend time with me. He goes to get one. As I'm waiting, I realize I'm feeling sad and frustrated. He won't really like me, he's just being polite. So I get up and start leaving quickly. An older man, short, glasses and balding like (Clyde?) starts talking to me. It slows me down. He stops to pee in a restroom stall, still talking. I can see the stream of urine. He didn't even bother to shut the door. I am offended and start running. Nobody cares about me, is my feeling. Another older man starts talking to me. I barely nod, feeling impolite but too angry and hurt to really care. Then an older woman says she wants to tell me a construction story and starts in describing the manger scene of Joseph, Mary and the baby Jesus. I give up and start walking back to where I left the young man, listening to her go on and on. I pass the two older men who look at me and apologize. I just wave them off. I know I'll see the young man again, but it can't be helped. Then I say to the woman, annoyed, "Are you telling me that the best occupation for a woman is to have a baby? You're telling this to a cripple?" I am incredulous at her insensitivity. (296 words)

I'm in an upstairs balcony hall above a gym where basketball is being played. I crawl out of a small rowboat onto the hall floor. We'd just gone through some crisis and everyone is responding to panic in their own unique way. My way was to drop my scrapbook that has past memorabilia in it. I then must pick it up, but I can't seem to get it together. The pages slip out of my grasp, things fall out. My mother says, "Leave it there, come on." I snap back, "No! I can do it. I want it." I continue struggling until I gather it up. I stand and look down at the gym floor. I see Darryl in a black leather jacket with his arm around a girl. I feel sad. I walk on. I go now to the upstairs penthouse apartments where my parents stayed the night. I want to see these posh rooms. I go in and see strangers there, packing up their bags. I see my mother and ask her if they had to share the rooms. She said, "Yes." I'm in a kitchen room and see two rooms that could be bedrooms and ask my mother which one she and my father slept in. She's harried and doesn't respond. I keep asking questions and it bothers her. She's angry at me. She turns and says, "You are not beautiful." I am very hurt and shocked. She continues, "You're not ugly, but you just aren't beautiful." She also tells me other things she doesn't like about me. In fact, she always pretended to like me more than she really does because she always believed you should equally love your kids; but the truth is, she never really liked me. I look at the view from one of the rooms. (303 words)

Tyler is being very tender toward me. I watch as an old priest and Tyler are standing with a renegade priest (Richard Burton) between them. Richard has been very bad and so Tyler and the old priest have to kill him. They are sad. They don't want to do it, but they must. The old priest holds Richard by the ankles over the edge of the cliff. Far down below is a rocky river edge and a river. Richard is terrified, but knows it must be. They let go and he falls, screaming. He lands in the river and splashes around. He calls up to the old priest, "I'll just swim upriver to drown myself." This is a courtesy to the priest, so he won't have to watch him die, but it's also a course of action to connive his way into extending his own life. The priest shakes his head and says, "No! Go downriver." Richard looks. Down the river are rocky rapids. It's sure death. He gulps and agrees, starting to slowly swim down the rapids. As we watch, he realizes the rapids are merely pools of water between big rocks. It's no danger and he smiles warmly back at the old priest. He will live after all. Later, Tyler is looking at Bonnie's back. She was hurt. He is gentle. I watch as he stands behind her and looks. Then he asks to look at my back. It's bent forward from sitting in the wheelchair so much. Then he gently turns me around and gives me "the colors." He presses his hand into my forehead, which forces me to lay back on his arm and a counter top. This causes me to see colors, but I only see a little bit. He says, "I'm sorry." I reassure him that I did see some colors. (307 words)

I am giving birth to my third baby. Someone looks under the blanket and sees that, unbeknownst to me, the baby is already born. He's very cute and lying on my belly. I am amazed and say, "But I didn't feel any pain, not even a tiny twinge!" Someone says, "But now we have to get the afterbirth out, that will hurt." I feel labor-like pains as they push on my belly.

All night long, Jared is drunk and talking in his incoherent, mumbly monotone. Finally, I have enough and I tell him off. I call him a boring bastard. Then I notice a baby girl standing inside a flaming fireplace. I go to her and say sympathetically, "You must be very hot and uncomfortable." She agrees. I pick her up and hold her, taking her away from the fire. (68 words)

It's my birthday. I get up and go to the living room, where there is a bed. On the bed is a guru person seated on a pillow. I say, "I dreamt you were here and now you are! How amazing." I am joined by a group of my women friends and a box of chocolate candies. It's not exactly the same candies as in the dream, but close enough. Then I get up. Howard has come in. He wants us to stay together. I want to get a divorce and go live alone in a cabin in the woods. He is sad, but agrees. We discuss who will keep the children. I want to keep them this time, but am torn, because it would be so hard, so much energy. (131 words)

Three women roommates have three or four men roommates. The women notice the men have disappeared and only come back occasionally and secretly. We look in their room and see only four shirts left in their closet. They usually have many more. We suspect they are out trying to have sex with the wife of one of them. The guy is gone so they're after her. We don't approve. I feel sad they would do this. Now I am one of the women and I'm hiding in the basement/laundry room to spy on them. I'm under a pile of clothes and sheets. They come in to get clean shirts. There is a gorilla/monkey with them. He makes lots of noise. I listen to them talk and realize they were being honorable after all. They've been going up to a monastery (I see a dragon-like creature with a Chinese monkey face) to take care of things there.

I had my passport and Traveler's Checks and now I can't find them. I'm looking through all the bags and feeling frustrated. I hold Fluffy and comment on the beautiful blue and black colors of her fur. The blue is startling. I am trying to tidy up the things and I start to paint the inside of the bag black. I have a tiny bottle with a brush applicator like typing correction fluid. I realize it will take a long time. The stuff is thick and hard to spread. One square wooden doll house room I decide to do in white. It's for my mother and I feel sad. (109 words)

Two men come into the room. They both like me and flirt, at least the younger one does. I am, however, drawn to the other one. He looks like Hector and is Native American, short and overweight. He's been in prison and he looks at me with intense, needy loving eyes. I don't want to like him, but his love and need draws me. He picks me up and carries me across the room and puts me down on the couch. I can feel his sexual desire and I watch him closely, feeling attracted and hesitant. I'm not sure what I want, so I just don't move, but watch him. He leaves me on the couch and goes into the bathroom and takes a bath. I follow him into the bathroom. The younger man is sad and leaves. A police man or detective comes around to check out this man. I sit on a counter top and talk with "Hector" as he bathes. I feel embarrassed. After all, he's naked. "Hector's " loving need for me brings him out of the tub and across the room to hug me. I'm aware of his sexual excitement and the watery feel of his still wet body. I stand up and hug him feeling his great love all around me. I relax into his embrace. Then a small girl comes into the room crying for her "Linda mom." She had awakened afraid and had walked out to find "Linda Mamma," even though she was afraid to leave her bed. I let go of "Hector" and pick up the girl. I hug her and say, "Linda Mom left, I'm the only one here. I'll have to do." She's sad, so I show her the bed that "Linda Mom" used to sleep on. It is piled high with laundry. Now "Hector" is back in the living room playing an Italian accordion squeeze box. Now there are two little girls and I dance with them. The littlest one dances between my legs as I hold her arms.

I go to the hospital to get surgery. I sit in the bed and see my mother and Grandma Mildred. I'm glad and surprised they came to be with me. Then, I see cousins, Marci and some small boys. I see Aunt Rosalie and Uncle Gus. At least I think it's him and wonder to myself, "If he was the one that abused me, wouldn't I know it by feeling bad or strange around him?" He and Rosalie are seated on the next hospital bed, Rosalie sitting up, and he relaxed and semi-reclining. I chat with the small boy cousins and ask their names. Then a nurse comes in to prep me and asks what meds I've taken. She then says, "You can't have your surgery today. You'll have to wait until tomorrow." The next day I'm going back to the hospital. Dwight is there and a small baby girl 1 and 1/2 or 2 years old. We are behind a marching band. I say, "We should hold her hand." Dwight holds her left hand and an older man in the band holds her right hand. I feel a little guilty that I don't hold her hand. We are holding up the last part of the parade and I suggest we drop back to the last place. We do. I suggest the man go on with the band and I hold her hand, but he wants to keep hold of her hand. As we walk down the hall, I ask Dwight how his litter of puppies are. "Which ones?" he says. "The really ugly ones with the wrinkled faces?" He says, "They're in the barn, doing OK." He'll sell them soon. I get into the hospital bed and the nurse comes to set up my IV. (296 words)

I am a woman athlete and go to the shower room. The men resent me. I try to ignore them. I am the only woman there. I go into a shower stall and look back out. I see a row of naked men, taking showers. I only see their back sides. I pull my plastic shower curtain closed, but it won't stay closed and I keep fiddling with it. I start to take off my clothes, some guy pulls open my curtain and I feel exposed and angry. A group of women march in, angry at me for being different. One woman says, "Some one has to get the dinner." I challenge her and say, "Dinner! Again, dinner. Do you have a food fetish?" I am snide. She takes offense and we walk toward each other, hands raised like boxers about to strike. We face each other and she backs down and walks away. Another woman says, "We'll march with you," and I say "Thanks, but let me take my trousers off first." I do so and we march for women's rights. (182 words)

Arvonne/Theresa sells her stuff at an outdoor flea market place. I am going to help her. She gives her stuff to me and I look through it to see if there's anything valuable or that I would want. I see photos and ask if she still wants them (she used to be a famous movie star). She's not interested. I'm moving her stuff. A man comes up and is interested in the saxophone, but he is sarcastic and I decide I don't like him. He says, "I'll bet you can't even play it." I sneer and say, "Even if I could, I wouldn't sell it to you." He gets rude and then leaves. (113 words)

(a naptime dream) I am a captain of a space ship, alone except for a robot "little girl." I occasionally sleep with her and feel guilty and wonder if it's OK. I decide it's OK and go on with my work. I float/walk down halls until I get to the "office" console where I drive the ship. I've received a cryptic message that seems to indicate someone is going to be attacked -- maybe this space ship, maybe earth. I ask my robot about it and she says, "But not tonight. It doesn't happen tonight." I am surprised "You can look ahead in time and know what happens?" Then what's going to happen. She is upset with herself for letting out so much already. She's nervous and says, "The blue paper will tell." I go in search of the blue paper, in the "office." I am aware that the attack is going to come from a race that painted their planet black so they could soak up the energy of the stars for their energy needs. They live inside the planet, which is brilliantly lighted and luminous. I find some files and go through them, no luck, then an old woman comes in with a plastic bag full of posters. Some of them blue. We look through them for the right one. (222 words)

I am outdoors and there is a fireplace with a fire going in it. I realize that my play scripts are in there, and I am frantic to get them out. I try to move the screen but it is locked. Peter B has the key, but he won't give it to me; he just doesn't care. I explain how important it is, but he's not impressed. I'm upset with myself that I put these valuable scripts in a potentially dangerous place. Finally Peter opens the screen and I beat out the flames. There is some damage, but essentially they are OK. Then Peter starts to kiss me. I am surprised. He's so young and good-looking. He undoes my blouse and I wait, aware that I've decided to make love to him. He lays me down and is kissing me when I open my eyes and see a woman on a ski-boat, upside down in the sky, hanging on by only a finger or two. She's having fun "hot dogging" and I am amazed and concerned she'll fall and hurt herself. I say, "Peter, look!" He's not interested. Now there are lots of students up there doing the same thing. Peter said this happens all the time. He takes my hand and pulls me up, we walk across the grass to a building and go in. It's like a radio station. I see a man in a glassed in booth. We go into a room where they store equipment. Peter introduces me to an employee there so he'll know it's OK I'm there. It's clear that Peter is looking for a place for us to make love. The employee is surprised. We locate a room and save it for later. We go out to the lawn area which is now filled with students rocking out to music. A party. I laugh and say to Peter, "There's no people here, even you and me. No people." (325 words)

I am Deana of Star Trek, we are on a mission. A she-devil comes and tells me she's got total control of me, or soon will, so I might as well stop struggling. I feel her mind take over mine and I feel angry and helpless. I struggle. She laughs and lays me down and she lays down with me and starts to kiss me. I feel overwhelmed and fight the desire to let go and succumb to her. I growl deep in my throat and I see I have a wolf muzzle and I bare my teeth and growl as forcefully as I can. This almost makes me as powerful as her and I am able to resist just enough to pull away from her. I run to where the crew is being held captive and I must choose the right packet. I don't know which one to choose. She's laughing at me. Her henchman is holding the two packets at me, smiling. The first officer is like Harry Anderson of Night Court and he's furious and disgusted with me for giving in or not having enough strength to fight. He grabs one of the packets and I bellow, "I choose that one." Then I must read the names of the crew from the packet. I can't recognize the names and he has to help me with the pronunciations. He jeers at me in disgust that I could forget my own crew. I am furious at him and in a way its my only salvation. As long as I concentrate on my anger at him, I can still fight her strong seduction. I successfully call them all and they are free to go. They and I run for the elevator. I am screaming in terror and agony the whole way. The elevator is long and narrow. I go to a back corner and cower, sobbing and screaming. He still relentlessly despises me. A medic examines me and tells him the she-devil had replaced my brain cells with hers. It was a miracle I could hang on as long as I did to a thread of consciousness of my own being. He replaces my own cells so I can be myself again. Harry is sad that he misjudged me so. (380 words)

At a noon meeting, I am one of three people being honored. The two men go first. Dylan H is very sweet and tender toward me. They take a break before it's my turn to be honored. I decide to go find a bathroom. I walk down a long hall. I ask directions of a cleaning woman and she directs me. I find some small broom closet like stalls and go into one after startling a woman in another one by opening the door on her. I sit on a shallow square hole. I have lots of papers and am trying to sort out what I need to take with me. I see I only need a few, but decide to carry them all with me. I go back toward the meeting area to be honored. Now it is decided that I will marry this other woman's husband. She's upset with me. I'm a little uncomfortable. I self-consciously go through some things of hers to get "my" share: an ornate embossed letterhead, a book about the French men. (He's French) I say, "I should read that." She says snidely, "What's to know, you just maul them and ball them." I shrug, a little concerned that I'm getting into something I've had enough of before (Howard and sex). (217 words)

(Tuesday) Rick and I sit on a couch. He is sitting very close and puts his arm around me. I feel a little uncomfortable and try to move away slightly. Now I'm married to someone like Josh We're seated at a restaurant table. Someone shows us a 12 step list of people who are in theatre and points out they are very similar to the OCUCA steps for counselors. I read the first three and see I fit the first two. The third one says people memorize large sections of Shakespeare. I haven't, so I don't fit. I see a word "fillias" and someone says that's "feet" as in meters or units in a poem. I am surprised it's spelled that way. Josh says we can't go to the workshop. Too bad, but we can go out to eat where the keynote speaker is at and hear most of the stuff anyway. I think it odd to get up from eating to go out to eat, but feel spontaneous, and go with them. (173 words)

I am slim and good-looking in a pretty dress. I am riding a bike. Men look at me in appreciation of how I look. I go to a cafe. The inside is crowded. I go to the old man who shows you where to sit. He smiles at me. I go there often. I say, "One." He looks around. There's only one place open, a school desk-like table right behind his. I sit there. Then I go up to get my food. I get a sandwich and a can of corn, but the can is flat. I go up to where the piano player is tuning up the piano and use the can opener. It opens it and I return to my table. I notice the can is still flat and mention it to the man who shows me the menu where for $3.00 more you can make the can round and actually get the food out. I am annoyed. What a ripoff. I decide to leave. Now the man is a spider and upset that I'm leaving. Now I'm creating a place to live, but the woman spider won't live there. She prefers to drown and throws herself in the water. The man/spider is very upset. I dive to try and rescue her (grandmother type woman). I search and search back and forth, feeling the sandy bottom. She's nowhere. I come up and see I'm at the edge of the room where the windows are. I see dustpans and say, "Oh, there they are." Now the man/spider goes into the next room following a single strand of silvery web. It is her. He asks her to please not die and leave him. She says, "I'll make a web and we'll both live in it." He agrees and I see two spiders together in one web. I feel repulsed by the spiders.

I see a man from high school. I pass several times looking for Amber. I feel sad that I didn't look at or respond to the man, and now he's gone. I now go past the dining area to the kitchen. Amber is sitting on the floor in a pantry talking to her mother. I wait until she pauses and I say, "Sorry to interrupt, but Dale has announced we're going now to see Grandma." She smiles and her mom says, "Oh, he did, did he?" I say, "Oh well, he probably means in a few hours. He knows how long it takes us women to get going." We laugh indulgently. I ask Amber if she's going. She says yes, she wants to. I sigh and decide to go because she is going, even though I don't want to. (181 words)

I begin my arguments to them now that I have their attention. I tell them I sympathize. They have been brutally treated by the whites. But this man is innocent.

I am in the M City house living room, in the early morning. Howard and Pete T are there to celebrate my birthday. Howard just sits there and doesn't do much. Pete brings presents, songs and joy. He represents Mary his wife. Now I sit on the couch. Lucy is seated on my left. Four babies crawl all over us, full of energy. One grabs my breast and sucks. I'm quite surprised as I'm not his mother and I don't have milk. I pull back and tuck my breast quickly back into my bra. Apparently it had accidentally been hanging out. I see a few drops of breast milk. There are four cats on the couch with us as well. Lucy is very sad and upset. She cries and cries about how she'll be going home soon to smoke more pot. No matter how much she tries, she can't seem to stop doing it. She feels hopeless. I feel a strong desire to give her advice. I feel she is just not trying hard enough. She's wailing so much about how hard it is, she's not just "doing it." My mother is tired and I say to her, "Next year, we'll do this at my house. All you'll have to do is make your usual two pies. I'll do all the other work." I hope she's happy and she sighs, happy but not convinced. (234 words)

Ginny says, "Now it looks like French provincial, not that dark, brooding Victorian brown you had painted them before." I agree that it looks nice.

I look in a spacious room with a wall mirror and say, "Look, this can be a dance room," and I practice a few ballet arm moves and watch my moves in the mirror. (117 words)

Our family is preparing to move to a new town and a new house. It was my idea and I'm excited. We are all walking to the car. I see a small kitty in the street. I try to pet it, but it's just out of reach. It's gray and cute. I finally touch it. As we go to the car, it runs under and I say to my brother Jake, "Oh, get the kitty out of there before we go; I don't want us to run over it." Jake smirks and makes some sarcastic remark about squished kitty. I repeat my concern to my father. Everyone gets in, including some new boy (2 years old), like my nephew Rodney. I say, "Uh oh, now is there room for me?" Someone (Dwight) says, "I'll put him on my lap." I'm the last one to get in because it's easier for me to get in the passenger seat. I get in and I realize I can't reach out and get the door to shut it. My father starts driving. I say, "I can't get the door shut." My client Theresa crawls over everyone and me to come up front to help. My father's looking for a place to slow down. She reaches around to my right on the outside of the car where the gas tank cap is and I say, "No, not there, on the door." She then reaches a gas tank-like cap she has out to fit it into the recessed hole that exactly matches the configuration of the cap and carefully moves it until it clinks in and then she pulls the door shut. Now we've arrived at the town. It's our new town that I've been so happy about and as we drive I realize I've made a mistake. I'm a teenager and all the stores have toys and amusements for children, which will be great for the kids, but I'll soon be bored and then there will be nothing for me. I see western town store fronts too. I start lamenting, "Oh, no. There's no one here for me. This is awful." Now we're walking across a huge field toward our house and I'm saying over and over, "I've made a terrible mistake. There will not be anyone for me here." My mother (young and helpful) shows me the two agate/stone teardrop shaped necklaces I've given her for good luck and says, "See, I've still got these on." A huge community marching band is preparing to practice for a parade. There are hundreds of people, many teenagers. We accidentally walk through them. As I'm looking around, I am still lamenting, "No one for me, a bad mistake." We are then surrounded by the marching/milling crowd. I see a woman in a wheelchair with huge back wheels, decorated. I'm annoyed with her. She nearly pushed me aside. I see young men pretending to be Indians on horseback. One has a flaming arrow, but the flame goes out too soon. My father points out a circle on a sign, like an Indian hoop, but it's an auto tire with tools glued to it to advertise a local car repair shop. We get through the people and now I see our new house. We go in. It's isolated and in the country. It's miles from town. The first room is a kitchen, and kind of messy. We're (my mother and I) looking out a window. I see nothing but grass (no crops). I then notice out the back window the shadowy shape of a big brown owl-like bird. "Oh," I say, "an owl." He flies around to the window we're at and lands right on the sill and we look at each other. He has ordinary bird eyes. Then he flies away. I go to the back window and look out. I see a creek. I say, "Look! We have our own creek." I'm thinking it might be fun to swim and wade in the summer, but then I notice mosquitoes all over the surface and tadpoles in the water. It didn't look so inviting. The bank on the other side goes up steeply, and there is not much space to run and play. There are hardly any trees. Now my mother and I go to the next room. "What's this?" I ask. "One of those 'dining room things.'" I'm not impressed. We go into the next room. It's huge and spacious. "It's another kitchen," I say amazed, "and look at the beautiful fireplace." It's a brick country style fireplace. We go from room to room, amazed at how many there are and how nice and spacious and pretty they are. We are called to look at the "play" room. We go in. Some of the kids have the couch made out to a hideaway bed. I see a piano but it has some keys missing. Then my father says, "Look at this!" with excitement. I look. It's a player piano. I'm so happy, just like at Grandma Agnes'. He points to the music roll and I see very ornate notation. The classics! Very unusual and complicated for a player piano. Then, I see there are two player pianos. I see another hideaway bed. It's not in very good shape. My father says, "The kids have already decided this one's for guests we don't like." I laugh. I see a back staircase and a tiny bathroom. It only has a toilet. I then notice the stairs are all flat and down, but if you push a button they pop up into usable stairs. I think, "That would be dangerous if someone at the top was coming down and someone didn't know it and pushed the button. They'd have quite a fall." (962 words)

Some children are going to show me the "life thing." They pull me into a room and are going to stand me up on a short platform but I want to be more important or higher, so I insist I stand on a dresser. I hold my arms up in the air and then notice a clingy sensation around the fingers of my left hand. I pull it down to look at it and am appalled. A thick spider's cocoon is wrapped around them and spider eggs are in there and hatching! I squirm to get it off me, and then I see there are snakes wrapped around me and termites or maggot insects on me. It is all nightmarish and scary and disgusting. I wish I'd never been so arrogant as to want to be higher. The children knew this and see I've learned my lesson and help pull off the snake. there is a strong sense of life among the decay - the seamy side of life. (169 words)

Mark G and I are attracted to each other. He's very sensual and sexy. We are crawling along a path of small gem stones, some made into rope necklaces. Mark is afraid because his father is coming near and maybe Mark won't do things right. I am not as afraid of him and talk to him. I pick up a rope necklace of stones and he shows me ones with flaws in them. (73 words)

Mark and I have been enjoying a long night of sensual touching and are about to make love. My mother comes up from behind the couch and has a disapproving look on her face. It's nearly 5 am and I should not do this. I should go to bed and get some sleep. I am annoyed with her and I get up and walk her to her bedroom. I am very firm and say, "Look, you go to sleep and leave us alone! Don't come in there because we are going to make love, so if you don't want to be embarrassed, don't come in." I leave her and return to Mark. (112 words)

I have inherited a huge, expansive house and extensive grounds. I am walking around and looking at what I now have. I see lots of places where some flowering bushes and benches and tables would make a lovely park or picnic area. I see several "out" buildings I think about tearing down. One is a tiny cafe/bar. It has three round tables, and an uphill slanted dance floor. There is an old organ you put tape cassettes into and a short dusty bar. I ask someone if I should tear it down. They'd like me to keep it and fix it up. I think maybe I will and tear down another building in worse shape. I go to the organ and pull out a few stops. It sighs a few notes. I find a drawer with tapes in them. I pull one out. It says, "Barb Sanders," and a form of Darryl is there. There are other names too. I put it in. It plays organ music and in the background our voices are talking from long ago. I can't make out what we're saying and lose interest. I open another drawer and see children's and babies clothing. I hold up a doll's head that has red hair, curly. I show it to Sonja and say she can keep it to use when she's explaining to people how she doesn't like to explain about her red hair all the time. I give it to her and for a moment, I think it looks like a shrunken head. Ugh. I pull out a huge yellow outdoor suit with feet in it and show it to Sonja. She says, "That would fit the disabled boy next door." She's been trying to encourage him to come out and play. I say, "Maybe you scare him because you're so forceful and intense about it." Then, I say, "Maybe somebody would be having babies and would want these clothes." I say, "Maybe high school friends Dora and Duane." Abner smiles and sits on the couch. Sonja says, "Not Dora. Duane's too old." I then remember she had a hysterectomy and think, "Well, maybe not then." I wave goodbye to Abner and Sonja. I'm going home to take care of business and then I'll return to continue exploring the house. I'm glad its near T City so I can see them more often. I get in a car and drive down the road which forks off to the right. (413 words)

A strong, powerful man and woman want me to fly with them. I want to fly with Abner. I feel overwhelmed by them and I pretend that I agree with them. We are ready to fly now and I've been very passive, but suddenly I switch and move over to Abner. This angers the other two. They chase me. Abner and I flee, flying. We know we're not as fast or as strong, so we hide and become invisible. We fly into an upstairs attic window (like a hay loft opening) and hide there. Our strategy is to count on their strength and speed to move them beyond us as we hide. (112 words)

A young man and woman moved to a new island to live. I am amazed to see the mangrove tree which grows straight out of the rocks and water. The shape of the tree is unusual. It has a thick trunk, round, a circle at the top of the short trunk and two branches, one to the right, one to the left (see drawing). A snake is curled around the right branch. This is a nurturing tree for animals. The young woman has two babies in one year. They move back to the mainland. (94 words)

Lucy is very upset and runs away crying. I want to help and the only thing I can think of to help is to get up and run after her, knowing it will be very painful and I'm not as fast and I'll go past my endurance very quickly. So I run after her. I reach the point where it's so painful I can't run any more and I stand, unable to move much. Lucy is now in an old rickety manual wheelchair (like my old one from Grandma Mildred). She sees my pain and comes back and let's me sit in the chair. She pushes me and we turn a corner and I yell, "You're going too far to the left. You're on gravel and missed the sidewalk." She's annoyed that I don't trust her driving. I said, "But Lucy, you're blind!" We're back on the sidewalk. I see a small thrift shop sidewalk sale. We stop and look. I hold up sweaters, lacy and soft and pretty, blue and white, dresses and so on. Lucy is looking at a baby bath thing. It has ice cubes under the top. Then she's bathing a baby. Some women are getting impatient, waiting for us to move. (206 words)

I am told that my sister Lydia died. I am shocked and sad. I'm sort of in shock and it takes awhile for the full feelings of sorrow to sink in. Some part of me seems removed, distant, almost objectively curious. I suddenly remember to ask my mother how she died. My mother said the four of them went to dinner at the Bates Restaurant. They all ate the same food and they all got sick, but Lydia must have eaten the worst, most poisoned part, and she died. They all threw up and had slimy, sticky diarrhea, but Lydia died from it. I shake my head in sorrow. She was so young and good and had so much to live for. Then I amend that part, living with Darryl, how could she look forward to living more? Cousin Patricia comes by to give me some photos she had of Lydia. It's tradition, when someone dies, people give back their photos to the loved one. I remember returning Terence's pictures to her.

I am going to meet Josh for a date. I'm late and can't find the place we agreed to meet. I turn right down a sandy, bumpy trail/driveway and park. I get out. No Josh. I notice I'm a half hour late; it's 7:00 pm. I wonder with some sense of foreboding if this means I'll have to kiss Josh (because we're having a date). I walk up a few wooden steps to a wooden landing and open a door. I see a bed with three cats on it. Then I see Josh, who is upset and out of breath. He pops into the room from another doorway from a hall at the head of a stairway (see drawing). He's wearing a hobo costume, wig, baggy pants like a clown. He says, "I had a hard time getting here. I had to take the express west. I've set up another time. See ya." He starts to leave. I am annoyed and confused. "Wait, I say, can I drive you home?" "Oh," he says, distractedly, or I say, "Is it hard to find?" He points, vaguely to the right; he has his back to me and says, "It's Hillyard West" (that is pretty far). I say, "Ok, OK," he starts to leave. I am upset that he'd leave after all the trouble I went to and won't talk about why he's left it up in the air about when we meet again. I'm kind of relieved, feeling like for some reason we won't see each other again and also mad because I'm feeling dumped and rejected, feeling some shame. Maybe if I'd been on time, he wouldn't be so upset with me. I want to say, "Let's talk this over. I'm feeling upset," but I don't say anything and shrug. He hurries down the stairs and away.

I am sleeping on a couch thing only I'm sort of outdoors in the city. I hear sirens and wake up. Some people say there'd been a terrible fire. A whole building burned. I asked them if they had been the insurance company and would have to pay. They say no. I am glad for them. I get up and look down the hill to the city to see where the damage occurred. I hope to see a big empty place where people can build, or just space, because the city is so crowded, but no, still a mass of buildings. Then I notice it's time for breakfast. Someone brings me mine, a bowl of eggs and milk and a live, little furry animal, cute, fat and cuddly. I call it an anteater because it has a skinny, long nose. I'm supposed to kill it and eat it for breakfast. I look at it and pet it. It's so sweet and cute, I feel sick to my stomach! I can't bear the idea of killing it, but I'm hungry. I make several weak attempts, but I just can't. A man (Tom Selleck/Alfonso) comes in and he kills it for me and plops it whole into my bowl of milk, and as he talks to me, I eat. In one spoonful, I see three pads of its little feet. I am queasy and think, "My God, he wasn't gutted or anything." I stop eating. I can't! The man talks enthusiastically about some neat group of people who are really good about understanding peace. I say/bragging, "Hey I know them. They sell things at booths and I often join them." I show a menu thing, "Holly for Peace" and things like that they sell. The man is impressed and grabs me for a long kiss. It is supposed to be pleasant, but it's kind of lifeless and boring and I try to make it more pleasant. No dice. (326 words)

Bonnie and Mateo come to visit me. My kitchen is a total mess from some big gathering I had. Bonnie's a little upset because I didn't invite her. She, Mateo, and I are washing dishes and putting things away. I open a cupboard and see it is already full of glasses. I look over at Bonnie and then I start to move things to make more room. I see a sugar bowl and a bottle of syrup that are a bright blue. I make more room. Bonnie says, "I suppose it's time to buy you some more greens." I say, "No, I've got plenty of canned green beans, peas and corn." She had meant salad greens. I agree I should eat more of them. Mateo wants to go home. He's tired and annoyed. There's just a small amount left, a big roast pan and lots of catsup bottles on the table. I look out a window and see a bright red fake fur pony and a small devil. I am struck with how total and bright the color red is. The TV camera goes in for a close-up to the devil's teeth. I think, "How amazing, he has my father's teeth!" They are slightly crooked in (the opposite of mine). I am drawn to these teeth. I think they are very handsome ones. The camera pulls out and now he's a very good-looking man on the soap opera General Hospital, and they do extreme close-ups of him because he's so compellingly handsome with those movie star teeth. They don't do such extreme close-ups to the other men; they aren't as attractive or seductive looking. Now the camera crew is calling different operating rooms to get their reaction to the show. So we're looking into an operating room. I see the patient and the nurses who answer the questions about the soap opera as they work. I think, "It's a lucky thing the patient didn't have complications while the show was on! The nurses wouldn't have noticed and the patient could have died!" The nurses only had favorable remarks about the new style of extreme close-ups with this one man. Now I'm a patient and am feeling the drowsy narcotic effects of post-op thinking, "I feel good now, but later this will hurt and be fearful and yucky. So for now, just enjoy the good feeling of stupor and well being." Bonnie comes by to see how I'm doing. (After I wake up, I think the phrase, "I walk on my dreams.") (421 words)

I'm in a room with Ellie, Dovre and Dovre's boyfriend "Dwight" who I call Stanley. It's getting on dinner time and I'm hungry. I want Ellie to fix dinner for us, but she won't. I feel anger at her stubborn selfishness. Now, I feel a little trapped because I want to order Kentucky Fried Chicken, but I don't want to have the expense of buying for all of us. I think maybe I'll only buy a three-piece meal and share it. I am aware vaguely that I'm being mean-spirited and ungenerous, but I resent having to pay so much, especially since it would have been so much cheaper to have Ellie cook up something. I would have done it myself except for my arthritis, so I feel trapped by my disability as well as my ineffective mothering skills with Ellie or my powerlessness to get her to behave. I see Richard Dreyfuss up in a loft area and think, "So, the movie has started. They skipped the first part...good." Dovre tells me she and the neighbor woman spent all last night "cross-dressing." She thought it was kind of kinky and weird, but was bored and so she went along with it. She's not too thrilled. She's still bored. Now we go next door. The neighbors are having a party. Dovre's ex-boyfriend shows up (still Dwight) and wants to see her. Dovre and I are surprised to see him. She's curious what he wants to say, but she doesn't want to talk to him. The neighbor woman says she'll talk to him and they go outside (we're in a kind of guest house, recreation room that hasn't really got walls, just the framing studs are up). I watch the woman and Dwight and wish I could listen in on their conversation, so a woman creeps up with a camera and mike and pretends to read a book lying down on her belly. The book is covering the mike. I'm bored with the current group of guests; they're all vacuous and ditsy. I see a pile of boxes and remember I had stored some of Dovre's and my things there. I start looking through the boxes. I find audio tapes of the Star Spangled Wash Board band's last concert and I remember I was bored with it because they did only their old material. There was no new stuff. I see video tapes of Harry Meets Sally (staring Richard Dreyfuss). I hear Claude talking in a bored way and remember he was married at last year's party and this year he's not terribly interested in me. I find photos I had taken of the wedding, or rather the reception after. I took a portrait shot of each guest. I want to keep those because I notice some of the poses are interesting; they were better than I'd remembered them (in terms of "arty" photography). I see a letter to Dovre from one of her girlfriends. It's a love letter and shows a drawing of a naked woman lying seductively on her side. Only her back shows. The letter says, "Could you consider loving me this way?" I think, "Huh, Dovre had a lesbian pass made at her too." I tell Dovre she'd better get her stuff as I'm taking mine. She shrugs and says, "I don't want it." I say, "Well then, throw it away." She says, "No, I want to keep it. Let it stay here." I say, "That's rude. They need their space, it will make a nice addition to their room. We need to find our own place to store it." She's not too happy, but agrees. I point to the letter and she says she's not interested in it and goes on. (624 words)

Sherry Lady and I are doing gentle aerobic exercises. I decide I want to do an obstacle course run. I start running across a field. Sometimes I slow to a walk. I get across it diagonally and turn left to climb fast up a steep hill, with stone stairs. Jock had seen me running and decides he'd better get ahead of me and pace me, so he does. We scramble up the hill stairs and then turn left to go across a dirt and dead logged area with a very dangerous steep downhill side. He stomps his boots into the dirt for better traction. It looks pretty scary and I almost decide the risk of sliding down hill is too great, but I decide to go for it. I walk carefully but lightly over the dirt ridge area. I do so safely. Next is a straight up "chimney" like structure with ropes hanging down. Jock goes up hand over hand shouting and grunting and swearing. I follow him up, going hand over hand fairly easily.

There is this black man in the jungle and I am sort of him. He's a lucky man. Nobody has much of anything, but he's managed to charm a wild horse into being his so he can ride. He lies sleeping on the ground one night and a huge snake comes up and stares at him. The man/me wakes up and feels fear and then a resignation. This is a big, powerful snake and it already has the drop on him. There is no way can he fight or run, so he smiles at the snake and waits for his death. The snake is pleased with his bravery and befriends him. So wherever the man goes, so goes the snake. People can hear it slithering through the grasses as the man rides his horse. Now the man, horse and snake cross a river to visit a hut there; a beautiful young woman lives there. They chat and then the man rides away to visit a white friend who does research. Now I leave the man, horse and snake outside the wooden house and walk in to visit. This white man is also very lucky. Most people don't even have a house. He's got a bedroom, a refrigerator and he opens it up to show me he even has lots of packages of frozen pineapples, a rare and healthy treat. I now go out to find the man, horse and snake but they've gone off on some excursion. I hope they come back. (252 words)

I have some land and I want a fence to mark a small portion of it off to garden since I'm going to have to rely on myself. I might as well use the land to feed myself. I ask this man how much he'd charge to do a wire and wood post fence. He says 25 dollars. I say OK. Now I'm walking past my neighbor, and see them cutting down a tree and see they are pruning branches that sprout from a large trunk stump. I think it will be nice when I have trees growing on my land. It's so new still. Then I see the fences are up and I am not pleased. He's used tall burnt trees or poles and strung wire on them way too tall and the burnt wood is fragile. And I only wanted the one fence, not two lines of them. I complain to him and he agrees to cut them into shorter fences so they are more usable for me. Now I am in the house. There is no furniture. I see one skinny old kitchen table, formica top thing, and try to position it so the built-in bench is best utilized. After trying different ways, I am satisfied and say, "See, now I can seat four at this dining arrangement!!" I laugh at my own silliness of calling such a simple thing a "dining arrangement." Then I see a bigger, better table in the next room and walk in and feel the places on the wall and say, "The refrigerator will go here, and the stove here and the sink here." Then I realize my husband is coming to the house. I've never met him before (sort of a mail order thing). I sit in an alcove at a big wooden table with other people. He comes in and I am disappointed. He's heavyset, older and stern-looking. He looks at us all and wonders which one is his wife. He chooses the young girl in a high chair and I laugh and say, "No, it's me." (347 words)

Sort of that same house, only back further to the living area and bedrooms. Relatives are arriving. Aunt Naomi is there. A naked man is standing in the hall about to go into his bedroom.

Aunt Naomi gets embarrassed and turns into another bedroom (my father or Dwight) to avoid staring at him. I go into the next room and see several couch beds. Grandma Mildred and a female cousin are seated and they look exhausted, staring, tired eyes. I say, "You look so tired! Lie down and rest." My cousin is eating dip from a steaming hot bowl. It burns her mouth, but she keeps trying. Behind her, cuddled up in blankets, is my father sort of laughing at my cousin. (162 words)

My "daughter" is helping me put finger nail polish remover on my nails and some spots on my fingers too. It's thick and gooey and it sits for a few seconds and then it's all gone, polish and all. We put some on a paper to remove a few messy spots. It doesn't work as well. Then she reaches into my blouse from the back of my neck and says, "Found these," and hands me two ornate bracelets. There are some red hearts on one, same color as nail polish. I say, "How could I have two bracelets hooked to my bra strap and not know it?" She shrugs and skips away. I am angry at her for using me and lying like that. She must have taken the bracelets and pretended to "find them" in my bra strap. Boy, am I going to scold her when I catch up to her. (152 words)

"She loves you, she just doesn't know how to take care of you and show her love." (I think of Ellie and I think of me.) Then I'm coming home from an all-day festival or fair. I'd stayed until the last act was almost through and now hurried home to pack. I knew Lucy and Mary would be upset for me not coming to pack up until the last minute and I walk in saying, "I've got it under control. You won't have to help." I go to each room grabbing up sacks and boxes of my things. In the bedroom, Charla is there too! Lucy comes in from taking care of Clarisa and rolls up my sleeping bag for me. I ask Charla if she could help me carry some things and she says no. I feel angry and powerless but choose to not respond that way. I cheerfully say, "OK," and I pick it all up myself, trying to make a game of it, to entice Charla to help. (234 words)

I am directing an open air play/movie. It's a rocky terrain and yet it's in a building. There is a high wall with very high windows like in a gym. Bright sun is beaming through the windows and I ask someone to go block it. Someone puts an Indian blanket over the window, but it doesn't help. Someone says the kleig lights were left on. I stop the actors and say, "Let's take a look at the rooms and layout so we know where to move." I draw a square on a blackboard and label one the living room. Then I say you know, like the "salon." Then I'm watching the actors and I stop them and say, "You don't have to shout. Here, let me show you." I run over and do Mark's lines as he watches. I walk up a few rocky steps toward the female actor and say softly, "Let me press your hand one more time." Then I change the line to, "Let me take your hand one more time." Then I run back to the camera and look through it to see how it all looks. I notice some Indians sliding down the hill on tires and I am annoyed. It's right in our playing area. (211 words)

I choose to wear a lovely dark blue and white polka dot dress and matching hat. It's a bit transparent. I wear a slip under it and look very pretty and sexy. I go into a room and a man, slightly overweight, husky build, is very attracted to me. (He's Katrina's brother.) I am shy. He gently pursues me. I am interested, but things keep interrupting. Paulina is there and I try to turn up the thermostat in the room. He tenderly follows me, waiting. I say, "I'm not ignoring you really." Then we are going to kiss and Paulina walks through and wants to know if I'm leaving with her at 4:30 am. I say, "No, go on ahead, I'll leave later." Then I get honest and say, "And maybe I won't go." She catches on, smiles and leaves. We go into a bedroom to kiss and make love. Now the scene changes and I have quite an obstacle course to go through. I must hop from one cement post to another with huge alligators leaping and snapping at my heels (spelled it "heals"). Then I move hand to hand across the wall full of drawers by the handles. Some are open and I peek in, nothing too interesting, some smelly gym clothes. Then we get to a room and scary people are in the closets and so on and if only he and I ignore all this and love each other anyway, then it will all go away. (250 words)

I am walking down a coast highway in the dark. A woman dressed in the 1950's bouffant hairdo, petticoats and white heels is walking right in the road. We call to her, "Oh. Miss, excuse me, Miss!" She does not respond. Then she's in her car but there's no lights on. We call again. Then she gets out and lets the car go on without her. We hear it crashing. Is she crazy? I run into the dark and then someone turns on flashlights so I can see. I catch up with her. I realize she's deaf and I try to speak in sign language but I don't know enough. She's very upset and I realize she's doing all this in a panicked attempt to get to the hospital before 5:30 because if her friend isn't removed before 5:30 it will cost $232 or $238 more for an extra day and they can't afford that! I reassure her the checkout time is midnight. She is relieved. (166 words)

Now I'm visiting Ginny and Ernie. But Ginny is very busy. She has lots of things to do, so I just hang out with her, kind of disappointed that we can't kick back and relax. Ginny has diarrhea and Ernie has a hurt back (bad back or shoulder). He talks about therapy he has to do. We decide to go out to eat. We drive. I'm in passenger seat looking for a restaurant. He finds a very fancy one, a "Shakespeare" restaurant, but we all agree we couldn't afford it. I ask, "What's the next town?" I see indentations in the sand and then I remember it's snow. It's a photo I took, round eye holes in footprint-like shapes (see drawing). (121 words)

I had recently moved into this house and now I'm getting divorced and moving out again. I open drawers and pull out posters and papers. A poster I made has a face I drew of an old bearded man, Freud. "Reviving Freud," it said. I see notes from college classes in PE, Health and Anatomy. I almost decide to keep them but decide not to. I'll never look at them again. I see some Library of Congress tapes in a closet. A woman friend says, "I've already read them, or I'd take them back for you." I'm a little annoyed with her. A true friend would do me the favor even if it didn't give her something at the same time. I start to roller skate through the empty rooms. I go toward the back of the house and into the kitchen. I look out a window and see a small, black, old sports car, the new tenant's car. Then I feel uneasy and realize I should go look in the closet. The "answers" may be there, long ago forgotten. I hesitate and fearfully go open a closet door in the bedroom. I look and see a telephone, an old-fashioned wooden wall phone. Then I open my eyes wider and it changes to a sideways view of my night table, like I'd really forced my eyes open as I slept. (230 words)

A man is showing me how to do something on a computer. My head is against his chest and we stay there hugging gently, except we are both pretending we aren't really hugging, we are simply working on the computer. I feel sad. Then we break apart and I say, "Hug me" Now he's older and overweight. He says, "Hug her" and points to Katrina. I say, "No problem, she's a friend." I hug her and say, "But it's not the same." He sighs and says, "I suppose we'll have to go to bed then." I feel sad and disappointed. All I wanted was a hug. (106 words)

I am at home trying to get everything straightened out. I'm moving the furniture so there's more room and its not so crowded. Someone comes to the door. I suddenly realized I'd forgotten rehearsal and the four cast members are at the door. I apologize and ask them in. We'll do a read through here at home. I see a small square card table but it has no legs. I see a round dining table and we go there. (79 words)

I'm at auditions. I chose my cast, four of them. Howie is glad I've chosen him and assures me that he was thrown out of the other production through no fault of his own. I don't believe him and feel uneasy that I've chosen him. He said the other teacher was Dan S and Jim G. I feel relieved it was only music teachers. I talk with Jock about who I've chosen. He openly grins at me at mention of Howie. "That nut! He's no good," he says. I feel embarrassed and then resolutely stand my ground. "I chose him," I say. "Huh," Jock responds. (105 words)

Now I'm trying to clean up the living room. A man says, "It's alright, I can handle it, but no, I wouldn't be honest unless I tell you it really does bother me. I don't like mess." I feel angry and helpless because its not my fault I have arthritis and can't keep it up. I feel guilty because maybe I don't try hard enough. Its not a priority for me. I see a dulcimer hanging on the wall and pick up several other instruments and hang them up in a lovely arrangement. I ask Millie how it looks and she shrugs, unable to come to an opinion. I decide I want to counsel her and start talking and asking questions like I'm a detective. I get her to talk about her childhood. She describes how she was always reprimanded for making mistakes. No matter what she wanted to do or believed she could try, Grandma Mildred and others would say, "Oh, you couldn't do that." Millie describes how her mother had a 7-year-old hooker (a 7-year-old boy that hooked rugs). They'd laugh and have fun and Millie felt left out and like the ugly duckling. Now my mother and Millie are at the sink cleaning up and talking. I'm to the right side listening in. I see a plate of pancakes in the sink and feel hungry for them. I see a piece of chocolate cake and chocolate frosting on the counter. Millie says, "I remember her. She had an infection." My mother thinks and then says, "Oh yes, I do remember now, a cyst." "Yes, an infection on the cyst." I say, "No wonder you don't think you can do anything!" I move over between them but that has broken the flow of memories they had. I regret doing that. So I move back to my other place and think, "Just be quiet and don't interrupt." Finally, Millie who has resisted this idea that she might be more capable than she thinks, gets what I'm getting at. She says, "Once I wanted to be a beauty operator." She chuckles, "Yeah, the stinky perms and even hand beauty scent." We smile. She moves my chair, telling me not to get up, she just has to get her apron on now. She pulls it out from under my chair. She puts it on saying, "I just feel better when I wear it during my 'official duty time'," said like "Howdy Doody time." My mother laughs at her joke. I wonder how to get her to the next step, which is to let go of the old training and reframe the attitude and get on with it. (446 words)

A small baby is handed to me to breast feed. She's tired and listless and barely shows interest. I'm amazed that I have milk. She gets the taste and then sucks in the whole nipple and feeds. I feel glad, then I hand her back to the man who gave her to me. The baby is now a rambunctious little animal that frisks and is hard to hold on to. (70 words)

A young sexy woman (Carole Baker or Marilyn Monroe type) is walking down a city street. She sees lots of buildings, shoe stores, only shoe stores. She looks up one block to the left and sees a bookstore and walks toward it. Then she can't find it but sees very ornate and unusual buildings. This must be the old, historical section of the city. She sees several churches with round designs on them. The church bells ring and she sees a whole line of different sized bells across the street and watches them ring. A small one accidentally pops out of the line and over by her. She picks it up and wants to keep it for a souvenir. She knows she should return it. Then a policeman comes by and she gives her some American money in coins for a tip for being so good. She tries to refuse the tip. He leaves it for her. She also sees some foreign coins and wants to take them too. Some other woman takes them. Now she decides to go into the building across the street. She does. Now an older, sexy woman joins her. They are both the women of this old farmer guy. The younger one is upset and wants to kill herself. She holds a spoon/knife to her throat. The older woman doesn't want her to kill herself so she tries to trick her. She flips the circuit breaker so all the outside lights go out. The farmer and his pals are out there and will come in to investigate. Meanwhile, the older one holds her spoon/knife to her own throat and says, "I know what you mean, let's do it together. I'll kill you and you'll kill me." She looks out the window and sees the guy sauntering in. He makes it there in time. Now a daughter of the farmer is there too. She's a quarter "roon" and lovely. The two other women go out to help her. (332 words)

I am in a building and go to the Performing Arts Dept. I ask a man if I could take a quick tour rather than pay to see the concert. He hesitates and asks, "You mean like 20 minutes?" and I say "Yes." He points to a door at the left. There are four doors in a row. I stand there. He opens it and I am now standing at the top of a long stairway that goes down through the seats to an enormous area now being used as a skating rink. I think tiredly of all those stairs, but then to my surprise, its a moving escalator. We travel easily down and then around on the flat area too. I turn to the man and say, "What a relief. I usually travel in a wheelchair." We go past the stages and I peek under the curtains. "How nice," I say, "People can come here to get autographs. Are there these belts on the stage?" "Oh yes," he says. I am pleased. Disabled performers can work here too. (179 words)

I'm at a convention for disabled people, a big crowd. I watch the entertainment. I look down at my legs and see large pink buttons had been sewn on to them. I am very surprised and asked Ellie when this happened. Surely I'd remember such a painful event. She and I discuss different times it could have happened. I see a rock group and go up to them. The lead singer/guitarist is a mean guy that wants me. I don't like him and walk away. He follows me, very demanding and pushy. Ellie likes him and I say, "But you don't understand, he nearly raped me. He's horrible!" (108 words)

I see two special effects sailing vessels going out to sea and over the edge of the horizon. I think, "How clever, they used silver metallic cowboy hats upside down." I then see a third vehicle, only it's a flying machine. I go over to see it. It's picking up passengers. It passes a group of hookers in red dresses like in an Old West saloon and picks up a group of modern ordinary people. I am one of them. I'm a young man. We board and sit. I have gathered quite a pile of maps, brochures, notes, and so on of my travels. The steward is an alien and not friendly at all. He calls each one of us one at a time up to the center lobby and tells us how much it costs per each piece of paper. It is very overpriced, deliberately so, so that we will be forced to part with all these things we dearly love. I am angry at the uncaring systematic way they do this. He hands me three or four small pieces of paper and says that's all I could really afford to take with me. I rebel and decide to take a heavy "trip-tik" like map. I figured I didn't have the money to pay for it, so they'd be shorted at the end of the trip and they deserved such treatment for being so arbitrary. I return to my seat. Now I am a young woman in love with a young man like Darryl. The crowd is urging us to make love. He doesn't quite know how and a woman says, "You stick this in there," and I feel the penis glide in and gasp at the pleasure. I apologize, by look, to several other passengers who are seated nearby because they can see and hear us. They shrug. It can't be helped because lovemaking is natural, but the circumstances aren't. They patiently sit through it. It goes on for awhile because "Darryl" can't seem to figure it all out. Then the orgasm and everyone is relieved. Now the man I used to be hears a heart beat of his father who has died of heart failure. It's a bittersweet memory for him. Now the alien mean guy comes in to the man I was and says, "You are a dream that deserves a chance to live." He meant the ship was going down because of some malfunction and we were all dreams but "he" was worthy of being ejected out of the dream vehicle and into life. (429 words)

I bring a man into my bedroom. We are talking. My father comes in and disapproves. He wants the young man out of there.

I'm at Grandma Mildred's house. I'm in the living room and look through the doorway through the dining room to the kitchen. I see three huge and beautiful windows, dark wood frames, but the glass is dirty and streaked. Grandma hasn't cleaned for awhile. There are bird droppings, too. (49 words)
Barb Sanders:#1837 (04/18/91)

I'm with a man and a woman comes up and says, "Wow! He's good looking." I hadn't noticed before. So the woman flirts with him and seduces him. There's a huge glass window and a rotating oval curtain. They are behind the curtain (see drawing) and so I follow to spy on them, but they decide to make love on the floor while hidden by the curtains and that upsets me and makes me mad. I stomp away and go to the car. He's written a note on the blackboard saying the keys are in the car, he'll join me later (he works for me). I'm pissed now and get into the low slung Jaguar sports car and throw it into low gear and rev up the motor and peel out. The motor whines and I shift gears, squealing tires as I pass a window. I know he'll hear my anger. I drive the freeway behind trucks and turn off a dirt road that ends up at a cottage that looks ordinary on the outside. I go in and see how lovely and luxurious it is on the inside - fireplaces, solitude and quiet. There is a picture window where I stare out on the crashing waves on the rocky cliff below. It seems the water's rising up, and I remind myself that it has never come to the house, even at the worst high tides. I then go to the kitchen to see if there's any food (the young man was supposed to have it ready for me). I open the freezer - two ice cubes. "Empty!" I say righteously. I open the refrigerator. There are a few jars of applesauce and some cheese. A woman says, "Here, I found a specialty meat. You like those." So we won't starve, but I'm still mad at him. I go in and play the piano with my daughter and Charla. It's a silly child's tune and I make up words about how mad I am at this guy, and then he and Robert Redford come in the door. (347 words)

I am swimming, holding a baby girl. She and I are flying just above the water because we swim so effortlessly. I get cocky and we're flying/swimming over a huge expanse of water. Suddenly "my little girl" is there too and we start floundering. She goes under and I have a terrible dilemma. Do I let go of the one to save the other and endanger myself as well? I dive for her and find her. Now I'm working hard to keep all of us afloat. I see a huge rubber life raft and we get in it, only it must have a leak in it because it's very limp and water is getting in. We fold up the limp parts and I ask the girls to bail. We manage to stay afloat. We float over to an opening in the wall and I see monsters, three ugly things. They capture me and put me in a cage with it hanging over some boiling oil or black sewage gunk. If I don't choose one of these uglies to marry, they'll dump me in the gunk. I don't know which fate is worse. I decide to choose one of the uglies. [BL] (200 words)

I was on the 14th floor of a building. There are dead bodies down the hall. Someone has killed them. I go toward that area to see what happened. The security guard suddenly gets up off the floor. He is the killer. I run away and he chases. I see an elevator and run down the hall for it, like in slow motion, trying as fast as I can. I barely make it and he nearly gets me as the door closes. I call 911 and yell "Help, the ____________ building on se Cascade, the 14th floor." (97 words)

There are long hallways and corridors that all keep going down. I don't want to go, but am drawn. I go down long stairs that curve, feeling scared. I enter a room that is luxurious, a waiting lobby before you enter the Prince's room. A woman is there and the Prince rejects her. I am hiding behind a curtain, watching, and he sees me and I come out. We talk. He seems to like me. (75 words)

I go to the house in T City. A man and woman, married, are there and very upset with each other. She cries and is despondent. She wants to leave him. I counsel her to stay. It will blow over. I get in the car and drive away, only the ocean is across the road and high waves are coming. I throw the car in reverse and back up quickly, back to the house. I go in to discover the two have killed each other, a murder/suicide thing. I am guilty, sad and upset. A small little girl cries. We have to stay the night because the road is blocked by the water. The girl is afraid to stay, but I console her, saying it will give us time to get used to it and forgive and learn to not be afraid of it. The next morning the man's spirit appears and forgives us. We go in peace. (158 words)

I'm at school, in a class, and I'm sort of the star pupil, like in Jeb's class. I talk a lot and then wonder if people are pleased with me or if they get bored hearing me so much and tune me out. The class is over and we get up to go to the next event. Someone comes up and says they enjoyed what I had to say. We then go to the restroom where I go into a stall that doesn't even have a toilet. The next stall has a toilet where someone peed on the floor a little. I pee a lot, reminding myself that it's OK, this isn't a dream. I then have to leave to go to the auditorium. My girlfriends and I go in and I say, "I want to sit in the back even if I can't see or hear things as well, just in case I have to leave to go to the bathroom." I then see Darryl. There is one seat next to him and two seats in front of him and I say, "Let's sit there. Come on." I rush and sit next to him. He and his friends quickly move over three or four seats like I had leprosy or something. I am hurt and so I decide not to show that I know him. Another girl sits in the seat next to me and I say, "These two seats are saved for my friends." The girl moves but she's catty and uppity first. I sit watching the show on stage pretending I don't know Darryl. At the end, I get up to walk away. He comes up to me and says, "Hi," and smiles, hugging me. I melt into his arms, forgetting all my anger. We walk out, still in an embrace, me facing him, standing on his feet, feeling happy to be with him. (317 words)

Now I'm at school and a juvenile delinquent boy is harassing me and my girlfriends. I say, "Just ignore him!" I hope he doesn't get us in trouble. He's talking about us going off together for a trip, him because he's in trouble with the law and has to skip, me as a cover or hostage, only he also likes me. I simply refuse. I get my books and hope to escape from him, but he follows. Now I'm in my home and walking down the hall to the back porch. I'm worried there are police out there and he'll get hurt, but also leading him out there so he'll get captured and leave me alone. I get there and the police are lined up in the bushes. They question me and my girlfriends. Did I know him? Did I talk to him today? Where is he? The girls lie, I hesitate, put on the spot between protecting and honesty. I choose to give true info but in a way that doesn't hurt him. Then he just steps out there on the porch and talks to me about leaving now. (He's somehow making it clear to the police I'm not a willing party to this.) He then says, "I'm just going to leave now," and steps off the porch and goes around the police and off down the road. I wait, worried. I know they'll kill him. Then we all hear a barrage of gun fire and then silence. I know he's dead and I start to wail my grief. My father comes up and tells me to go inside and I cry out, "It's your fault. I hold you to blame." Then someone yells, "Fire, the house is on fire." I see flames and I run into the house to get my things that he gave me to remember him by, even though the smoke chokes me. I get everything, a diary, a purse, some books, and then I run out to safety. (334 words)

I am with the three girls. I can see they are unhappy. I decide to take matters into my own hands and tell them they will be happier if they would seek counseling and get to work on their co-dependency issues. Dovre in particular is not thrilled. "Coda," she says in disgust. She has a young man with her and the three of us are waiting for our rental car. I see a man get in a car and I am upset. He's taking our car. I run over and we get in the backseat. "This is my car," I say. He disagrees, but finally gives up because I'm so adamant. I quickly get into the driver's seat and then I look around more closely. This car is very tacky, old and in ill repair. He was right. It wasn't mine at all. (He reminds me of Jared and the car of our red "scat wagon.") We get out and go to the rental shop. I ask for the manager because the clerk is no help. He says, "Sam's at the pool table." I say, "Which one is he?" The clerk says, "He's a she and she's the one wearing overalls." I go in and see all women around the pool table. I ask one if she is Sam. She says yes. I explain that I'm waiting for my rental car; it's late. She's uppity and of no help. She smirks. I somehow realize its a scam. I can't go to the police because she's paid them off. She gets a kickback from the insurance company. I decide to sneak into the back of the shop and steal it. Since its contracted to me, they can't do anything about it. I do so and now the driver is some alien male and I keep making him make love to me to wear him out, which will prove he's an alien.

I'm at my Aunt Millie's. I look in a mirror and see a Bugs Bunny figure reflected from the other room behind me. I tell Millie, but she's not impressed. I look again and the figure has changed into a cute angel named Millie. She flies into the room I'm in and we smile at each other. She has a short dark pageboy hairdo and a cute round face. She's going to fly through the wall, but gets stuck because of some cellophane ribbon material, part metallic, that I had hung on the wall. She pops back into the room and I point out a bare space on the wall. I pull out a small, thin nail that might impede her travels. She tries again and gets through. Aunt Millie's husband is out back gathering up stuff. I'm supposed to dive into a swim pool and get the orange juice container. I hesitate and then dive. As I'm underwater, an invisible snake-like creature called a Heffalump curls around me and assists. It scares me and I'm told it's there to help me, learn to trust it. I tell it telepathically what objects I need, then I dive in and she gently creates a place for me to rest like a leaf to sit on and then she efficiently gets my objects for me. I am pleased with her and admire her powers and gracefulness. She is gentle. (237 words)

I'm outdoors and I see this guy and we get to talking and flirting. I kind of like him and as we are chatting, I lie down on a picnic table like thing and we're hugging and talking and then I feel the top of his penis inside and I'm surprised. I pull away and he is disappointed; it took him some work to get that far out there in public, all of us fully dressed. I apologize and we decide to go on upstairs to my room. I had thought we were going to go downtown and have fun, but I shrug. After all, it's pretty obvious he wants sex and it could be fun and we can go out together later. So I agree and we go upstairs. I think, "This is kind of neat because this guy is Peter Sellers and now that we're being intimate and having fun, he'll be interested in a playscript I'll write especially for him and then I'll become rich and famous, just like a dream coming true." Now we're in a room and both are naked. He's lying in bed under the sheets and he looks different. He has long curly hair like Arlo Guthrie. I'm standing up, pacing at the foot of the bed, on the bed. Before we got to the room, I remember thinking, "I'm glad he's overweight because then he won't be turned off by my droopy 47-year-old body." (242 words)

I and three or four older men are asked by the conductor to carry the bass fiddles back to where they belong. He tells us the different names of the instruments and shows us how the shape of the hole tells us which family of instruments it belongs to, the bass violin, or what. He demonstrates how to pick them up and says you spread your knees and "waddle walk." Then men chuckle at how absurd this will look. I pick up mine and we walk single file out to the street. The men are quite upset to think that a girl should carry such a huge, heavy thing and keep trying to take it from me. I am a little annoyed with them and resist, saying I'm doing fine. I realize we're past the right building so we all turn around and walk back. I'm looking for a several-storied yellow building. I've passed it by before; its hard to find. I realize I don't have my fiddle and ask where it is. They look and they only carry their own. I see it back about a block leaning on a building. I go get it and come back to the guys. I put the crook of my finger in the breast pocket of the coat of one of them. He looks at me strangely. I say, "Sorry, I just wanted to be connected." I try several other spots and choose a watch chain like thing that seems OK with him. We continue walking. I see the building, "Lyons Building," right next to the Music Co. Building. I say, "Here we are." It's not yellow. It's got smoked glass doors. We go in and now the old man is an old woman and we look for the elevator. A small parade of disabled people with silly party/helmet hats on go by and we smile and sing the weird calliope music they are playing. I see an elevator and we get in and at first I only see two buttons and then the button 13. I push it, the woman says, "No, bad luck." "I don't believe that unlucky 13 business. That just happens to be the number of the floor we have to go to the Columbia Record Co., and book," I add, because we are now returning a book. As we get out of the elevator, we are at a bar. So we stop for a drink. The old man is now seated at a table behind the bar, watching us. He looks tired. I look for the bartender. A young woman pops up and asks what I want. I say, "Do you have any sugared snacks? I am hungry for something sweet." The old woman is close to me and I realize she'd like to make love, and I think, "But, she's a woman now, not a man, that would make this a lesbian thing. Besides, she doesn't have a penis now, so what's the point?" I tell the bartender to look for sugar-free ice cream. She doesn't have any. The only thing she has is teas and soda water that is sugar free. I decide on the teas because they have interesting flavors. Meanwhile people come crowding down the hall and I'm pressed up against the bar. Then several zoo animals are walked by. I see a rhino come around the corner and realize he could poke me in the butt with his horn, so I try to scrunch up to the bar as far as I can. I see the rhino turn his head so that the horn is pressing nearer and I say to heck with this and hop up to sit on the bar. Two good-looking young men who look alike are other bartenders and they laugh and say, "You could have got it in the butt." "No thanks!" I say, realizing they are probably gay and like it up their butt. Then around the corner comes more animals and I am relieved it's no more rhinos, but a herd of dogs, each on a leash being walked by this guy. Even the tails had a leash on them with bells. He walks them, or rather they drag him down the other hall. (709 words)

I am attending rehearsal and they do a read-through and then Sunny wants to go home. I'm surprised because there's an hour left and I want them to do another run through and use the time. Peter B agrees with me, so we do it again. I go to visit the set. I see Sunny has a heavy, wooden square with windows that open and shut built on the stage. "How can the audience see the actors?" I ask. "Well, that is a bit of a problem," she admits. The oak paneling is old (like Shakespeare's time). I feel frustrated, so I go sit outside the structure, but on stage. Somewhere chair people in the audience start chanting, "Slyvie" as a joke and I call out, "No political announcements." They laugh with me. The play begins with the man in a chair dancing rock and roll. I decide to go up one level to see better. I go up an elevator, then it's time to go back down, and I come out of the elevator to darkness. I am afraid. I realize two men are backstage and one has a gun. I scream at the top of my lungs and run one over with my wheelchair. I force the gun out of the other guy's hands. He puts his hands up and says, "I'm leaving the gun, so you'll have to explain it and you'll get into trouble." But I don't fall for it and march him through the set and off into the audience. I notice its 9:00 and they are almost done with the play, over an hour running time, and that they use real food in the dinner scene at each rehearsal, very expensive. I don't approve. I apologize for interrupting and ask them to call the police. I am then talking to Andrea on the phone, explaining what happened. I hear a baby crying in the background. (321 words)

There is a stage with a swimming pool of water in front of it. Pairs of people are being dunked in the pool. One is a real person, one is a mannequin dummy. Each wears identical outfits. Then they go stand up on a stage while the clothes dry on them and we try to decide which outfit dries better-looking. I can't see much difference. Someone else says the dummies outfit looks better. One pair has on yellow dresses with a white lace collar. Another has on a white sweater blouse and a short black skirt, sort of 1960's. I see a side view and the breasts of the yellow dress women are slightly exposed by the now low cut style of the dresses. And now it's time to go home and my relatives start crowding in the car. I see Abner, and Uncle Dale and I are standing up in the front seat between the passenger and driver's seat, facing the back seat. I am behind Dale and almost hugging him, we are so crowded. My father is driving and off we go. A woman like Glenda B is there too. We drive around the house on the yard. Now the car is a basset hound and I'm standing on the loose skin around his sides. He yelps once because it hurts. We rush into the house right behind my father who says she'd (Glenda) get dinner and a book and stay the whole evening reading the whole book. I turn down the hall in time to surprise my father as he's walking out of a bathroom zipping up his pants. He looks surprised. I turn quickly and say, "It's OK. I didn't see anything anyway." His eye looked like the eye of a hawk before it turned into a woman in "Lady Hawke" movie. I see a potty seat extender on the floor by the bathroom door. It is a deep yellow color. (325 words)

Ginger Rogers and her roommate leave their apartment to walk to work some few blocks. As they are walking, a series of earthquakes hit. She walks past a line of cars parked and someone says, "Don't look, a man is trapped in his car." I (the roommate) can't resist looking. I see a 1930's style convertible, bright blue, with four to six people in it. It is tilted forward and on an edge. It rocked back and forth and I wonder why the people aren't getting out! That's a dangerous place to be sitting. Then I realize it would also be dangerous to move, it will throw out the balance and the car would go over the edge. Ginger and I walk on and go to our apartment. Fred Astaire is there and doing his best to charm Ginger, who rudely ignores him. I need to go to the bathroom and sit on a toilet which is back to back with another toilet where a man is going to the bathroom. We both reach out our doors for the one roll of toilet paper. Our hands meet and we play fight for the tissue. Finally I'm all wiped off and I go back into the living room. There is a man with a charming fake French accent also trying to gain Ginger's attentions. I sit on a chair and Fred sits on me. He hands me a paper with fake French accents sentences on it and asks me to say these, to the other man to keep him occupied while Fred works on Ginger. I stroke Fred's naked, soft young back and say with feeling, "I'd do anything for you, Fred," wishing he could be mine and knowing it was impossible. He gets up, now dressed and flirts with Ginger and I say my sentences at the man who pretty much ignores me. (313 words)

I am making love to a man like Billy Crystal. I am very sweet and tender, loving. He sobs, "I can't have sex with you because you make me feel so loved and cared for, I can't concentrate." I feel unhappy, because I'd like to go on, it feels good. Later, he is able to manage sexually and we have a pleasant orgasm. (63 words)

I am in a car with Tom Hanks. I make witty remarks and do impressions of famous voices. I do Jimmy Stewart. We're in front of a movie theatre that features male stars like Stewart, John Wayne and so on. Tom looks at me and says, "Are you auditioning?" I realize I am. (53 words)

I am a shy person and gifted musically. A female teacher lives with us. She teaches piano and composition. We are together a lot and she hugs me and sits close. This is OK until she becomes sexual, kissing me and trying to seduce me. I feel repulsed and try to pull away. She says, "Either you go out and get involved with men or you stay here and be involved with me." I'm afraid of both situations, but choose to leave and find a man rather than stay with her. I get in a small car and drive. I find myself on a road inside a building that goes to a distant cousin's house. Maybe she can help me get over my shyness so I can find a man. I knock on her door and go in. She's busy and isn't sure who I am. She offers me basic hospitality by pointing to a bottle of pink wine and saying I could have a drink if I want. I admire the glass jug and politely comment on the pink color, how pretty it is. She's busy with her children. I leave and decide I must go home to visit my mother. I'm on a motorcycle-like thing. I have to drive through a window, on the 2nd or 3rd story of a building and trust that I would land safely! I don't feel much trust, but I smash through the window. The cycle and I are in thin air and I can see the streets and plaza below me. I just know I'm going to crash and die. But somehow I drift down and land safely. Then as I drive down a street, I see some savings stamps (like S and H green stamps, only they are red) fall off my cycle. I don't want to take the time to stop, but I do because the stamps are important. I get them and also get an envelope full of photo negatives. I'm glad I stopped. Now I return to my home. My mother greets me. I see the music teacher is still there. She's suggestively embracing my mother. I glare at her. She is hurt. I tell my mother, "I'll stay here until I can find a place of my own, where I can live alone." The teacher hears this and realizes I mean I haven't given up and returned to her. She leaves the room angrily. I go to my mother and whisper, "You have to tell her about the beds." My mother says, "This is a very delicate situation, but I'll try." As I walk with difficulty up steep stairs, I hear my mother saying to the music teacher, "We have to take the double bed out now and replace it with two single beds," one for her and one for B. I am at the top of the stairs and am crawling, hanging on so I don't slip and fall. I ask (I'm B now) how I'm supposed to get to the bedroom (see drawing). As I can only see a rail to hang on by my hands and swing hand over hand, she says, "Go through that door." I see a small door and I pry it off its brass nails/screws and enter a hall. It is being remodeled into a nice room. I see beautiful dark green carpet and comment on how pretty. I see a small black piano. "Is this going to be a living room or a dining room?" "No," she says, "A music room for my mother." We pass through it to the bedroom. (602 words)

I'm Cary Grant's wife and we are in a comedy 1930's movie. He wants to buy a lottery ticket and I ask how much and he says, "1,000 dollars and a tuppance." I am indignant. "A tuppance?" I say, "That's too much to ask! A tuppance, indeed." He does his comedic "Hum" double take and then points to the line of people waiting to buy tickets. A young woman announces her mother works at a bank at the other end of the mall. I think, "What clever foreshadowing because he'll want to borrow money later in the plot and it's all set up where and how." He then suggests to me that we offer to pay off the other people and then we'll get the winning ticket and be rich. I smile indulgently like a good movie actress wife. He does this and all the people scurry off to collect. He turns to me and says, "Uh oh, I don't have 8 thousand dollars to pay them with. Maybe they'll forget and go home." We are going toward them. One man tries to get around Cary, and Cary says, "Tsk Tsk. Now I won't tell you where the elephant is." The man goes quickly by as Cary comedically watches from the turn style (the long way). He says, "Will you look at that? He went around the elephant. Hum!" The elephant is a shortcut path to the lines. We get to the lines and I see Cary's other wife in the other line. (253 words)

I am going to direct student actors doing a couple of pages of MacBeth. I recruit a black man and Warf. We find an empty classroom and I tell Warf to leap up to the black man's chest and push off with his feet, a spectacularly dramatic fight scene. As they are rehearsing, a professor comes to the door and is quite belligerent about us leaving. I walk right up to his face and argue eloquently about our right to be there. He is angry but goes away. Now it is opening night. I'm in a manual chair and have to pull myself up eight steps to get to the stage door. I go on stage to announce the piece. The mike is too high. I launch into a very moving speech describing each obstacle I had to deal with to get this piece on stage. The audience is far away and off to the right, but they are moved by my difficulties as I describe them. I tell them there was only one classroom accessible enough for rehearsal, then the professor discriminating against us. "He got in my face, well, actually, I got into his too." Everyone chuckled. I described how I had to pull myself and my chair hand over hand up the stairs and then the mike was set for a standing person. "Naturally you would do that because all your experience is your own able-bodied self, so how could you know what it's like to be in a chair? But dare to expand, take the challenge and enjoy our differences. Celebrate our diversity. Don't be afraid of it." They gave me a standing ovation. I was quite pleased. (282 words)

Howard and I are in bed. He wants to make love. He tries to kiss me. I am repulsed and sad. I feel empathy and sadness for him because he wants it/me so badly. I feel so sad for me too. I want sex, love and relationship and to say no to him means saying no to myself as well. But I can't get over the repulsion I feel. He cries and says, "You used to be so beautiful," meaning when I was younger. I am surprised. Maybe he is finally able to express his emotions! But as he continues to talk, he clearly stays in a logical, digital based conversation. I am disappointed. Then I hear about a Wash. DC Senator (also Howard) who's thinking of suicide. I ask him if he will. He says no. (137 words)

The landscape is flat, barren, and wet like rows and rows of planted things that haven't started growing above ground yet. Creepy crawly things that are poisonous live all over these rows. There's only one small island free of all this yucky stuff. A woman says, "My ugly daughter is at the island. Some man lured her there to make love." I'm amazed this woman is so open about her ugly daughter. I'm a little offended she would consider her daughter ugly and say so. I go out at night walking on the rows where the creepy things are. I am bare foot and concerned they'll get me. I envision rubber boots on my feet to protect me. I feel better now. I see one of the things that looked like a clam shell with antennas that was eating other things. I feel sad and repulsed when it eats a baby thing. I see it crunching something and see the remains, a tiny pearl necklace and some lace (like it had been a baby). Earlier, I had a cat in my arms and I see two huge insects and I put the cat down and he eats them, crunching loudly as they twitch. (Ugh...)

I am a young man with shoulder length hair like Mark (or Jesus). A beautiful woman is attracted to me. I am to her. We are scientists that work with animals. Suddenly she turns into a crazed creature that kills and maims. She must touch your hands and then rips you up, your blood rushing out all over. The man sees her do that to some research animals and runs to tell the others. All the blue uniformed (overalls like mechanics) gather together and she comes in, sweet and interesting, a siren hard to resist. He almost lets her touch him, but the others rush around him and they all hold hands. She blacks out and comes to seeming normal. She asks, "Did I black out?" They all nervously watch her and try to appear nonchalant. She says, "I need to do the weight drop." They all go with her. It is a machine that runs straight up 200 ft. and then smashes toward the ground very fast. She is very adventurous and loves it as fast as it will go. The men love it too and are nearly swooning. One man says, "Wow! That's even better than sex." They admire her. Then they run to another room and hold hands. She comes in, cajoling, needing to connect and hold hands. A woman runs in screaming, "She got to all the animals. You should see them. It's horrible." I see and hear blood spurting out of their bodies. It's sickening. She grabs the last hand of the serpentine and one of her hands is free. The crazy woman comes toward her. The woman at the end of the line wants to give in to her. I (now a woman) scream, "No, NO! Don't let her touch you." I manage to penetrate the spell the monster woman has created, so she goes up to a woman named Doris, in the middle of the serpentine. She nearly lures Doris into letting her join the line. I scream over and over, "Doris, Doris, don't let her. Concentrate." I break the spell again. The monster woman goes from the end woman to Doris over and over again, almost making it each time. I am exhausted, but must fight on. (375 words)

A man is concerned because one of the women pilots has been kidnapped by the 11,000 slave girls and taken away. Another woman says, "Oh, my!" The man says (I think) that he doesn't mind it being women, whatever people want to do, but the drugs (stuff) is very bad. We have to rescue her. The woman thinks that's going to be hard. So the man goes to where she is, sneaks in and tries to seduce her. We, the audience, are watching the love scene like we're watching a steamy movie. He kisses her, very sexy, and we love it. Then he pops his penis in and the feeling is so good. She pops up to sitting. "Wow, made me sit up and take notice," she says. Then more steamy kisses. A woman says, "I don't mind, but boy, was the beginning part good!" Now they must escape. He sees an airplane outside, these huge, open glass doors. They make a break for it, but it turns into an older man who laughs and waves a book at us. He's got immune status and so we can't hurt him and he doesn't have to help us. We veer off into another building. They're closing in on us. (I'm the man now.) I see some rolls of TP and say, "Thank goodness." I grab a lighter out of my blue overall uniform and start to set it on fire. The bad guy is nearly upon me. I turn the flame on him and he keeps coming at me. I keep the flame on him at full blast and he gets redder and hotter, and finally, a metal button hear his crotch gets white hot and he's in extreme discomfort. I know I've won because he's going to burst into flames and I'll get away. (304 words)

I see a bear off in the distance. It's the one my father, an Indian Chief, has happily pursued and hunted for years. It's his great joy to try and capture this bear. It is coming toward me and I must protect myself or it will kill me. I have my father's .22 rifle. I shoot at the bear over and over, but it only enrages him and he's close now. I aim for the eye and shoot and shoot. Now he's on top of me, mauling me. I keep shooting and finally it dies. I crawl out from under it and crawl, bleeding and maimed, to my father's horse. I put my father's rifle in the holster on the saddle and ride back to tell my father I have killed his bear. I am worried he will be upset because I've brought to an end his favorite sport. I see a small, naked Native American man. He's out of shape and his body fat is down around the belly and hips. He tries to suck it all in and his chest rises to look more manly. [BL] (187 words)

I am at a high school, maybe T City High. It's sort of reunion time and I'm looking around. I can't find the room I'm looking for. I meet this guy. We are friends. No sex, just very connected friends. It feels wonderful. We walk arm in arm and hug and talk and really care about each other. His buddies (three of them) see us and are annoyed. So I walk up to one and grab him by his tee-shirt collar with my left hand and say, "Hey, watch this!" I wind up my right arm to pitch an imaginary baseball. I pretend to throw one. He's very impressed I can do that. So they all accept me. It's past time to go home. I'd been having such a great time, I forgot about time. Now I have to go to the bathroom. I find a bathroom with a tiny, broken toilet. I go in and remind myself not to really pee. I think I should just get up and do it right. A woman with her 4-year-old daughter opens the door and then apologizes. I then get up to walk home (like toward the M City house). I see my father in a car a block away, he's worried about me and is looking for me. He waves a black and white poster at me. I wave back, embarrassed to be late and relieved he's here to help me. We now go across "the bridge" like the railroad trestle at M City, only it's indoors and dark. I step on the wooden planks and say, "I'm afraid I hate these trestles, they're so scary." I'm afraid I'll misstep and hit a blank spot and fall or step on a rotten part and fall through. I clutch my father and he hugs me and helps me across. Finally, it's too much, so he hops down the rocky side and reaches up his arms to help me down. I am hesitant, but then jump into his arms. He catches me firmly and hugs me. I look back and see a wall of rock and say, "It's a good thing we went on the bridge after all!" We now get to the door of the house (it's like we're in a tunnel). It's locked. Oh, no! We pound on it and wait. My mother finally opens the door for us. We are home safe. (402 words)

I'm running through a crowd of people, a man is chasing me. I mostly just see his wrist and the suit and shirt cuffs. He's very tall. He's smiling. He's going to rape or hurt me. I look around for help, trying to stay in the crowds. I see a police station, but it's a block away and no one's around. I try to run for it, but can't run very well or fast so I turn back to the relative safety of the crowd. He's closing in on me. I try to hide under a decorative table cloth, small round table, two big, round cloths draping it. It's not going to help. I start shaking from fear. (118 words)

I'm at some vacation resort. I've joined my friends, Mary, Lucy, Rochelle, probably Katrina. I am in a room next to Rochelle's. I'm putting lipstick on and also coloring in the flame designs on the wall. I don't know how to do it free hand but I can copy what's there OK. I see a movie through a window that Rochelle has starred in. I'm impressed, and a little envious. Here I thought I was the one doing great things, and here it is her that's working and famous. So we're all going out to eat in the next room. We've got a station wagon and we have to go down some stairs. I physically push and pull the car down the stairs. Mary stands in front to help if I need it. I am amazed I'm able to do it myself. We push the car right into a rowdy gang of boys/men, Ringo Starr and others. They snicker and decide they need to teach us a lesson. I pass them, hoping they'll go away. They follow. I go look out a window with my camera to take a picture of the lovely water (a river). I see reflected in the window glass these guys coming up on me. They gather and talk about how they are going to rape me and hurt me until I tell them something. I turn to them. Suddenly it rains, coming through the open window, drenching everything. I hide under a blowing curtain to not get so wet. A short guy in a leather jacket is going to rape me first. He walks up to me. I say to them all, "If you're going to rape and hurt me, then I will simply get stubborn and shut down. I'll never talk. But if we talk this out, I may tell you." They cough. My back is to the wall. I'm in trouble. This vacation is ruined. I think, "Oh well, no room later out of the rain for me. They'll fix that." Then I remember my friends. I can bunk in with them. I'll be out of the rain at least. (357 words)

A man, Claude, is dancing ballet on stage with a group. I am watching from backstage. It all looks fun, cultural and nice, I keep moving around to see him better. I realize I'm sort of on stage at one point and move out of the way. After the dance, he comes over. We are shy, but like each other. I'm seated on a chair and he sits on the same chair. We are close and talking. Then he puts me on his lap. I hope I don't weight too much. I wish I'd lost some weight. We have coffee/tea, drink and chat, really enjoying each other's company.

I am a counselor at a prison. My boss is a principle. I go to his office. He's a nice enough guy. He has two knickknack shelves. One holds five pots of coffee, the coffee can being part of the pot. Each one is brewing. The other shelf has red glass vases and pitchers and pretties. It's probably his wife's stuff that there wasn't enough room at home to show. I realize he doesn't even offer me a cup of coffee, which is a good thing because I don't like coffee, but it is a bit insensitive. It's time for me to meet (written "meat") my two very fat counselees. I am dressed pretty, but change into glasses, a big sweater to disguise my womanness so I won't distract them. It doesn't work, of course. My course of therapy is to have them swim, and we talk about their pain. They don't open up to it easily. They are hardened criminals. (161 words)

I'm still working as a counselor. I have a daily appt. with this one group just before 5:00 quitting time. I give them a list of math problems and I observe them as they try to solve these unsolvable puzzles and that's the real test, how they deal with frustration. I give my "father" a test because he's curious about it. I think, "This will be interesting to observe. I'll learn something about him." He bites his lip and paces, very unhappy he can't figure it out. I explain to them they are gibberish for a reason, because it would be awful. In this volatile prison environment if some got the problems and others didn't, then the one who didn't get it would really feel stupid! Their self-esteem is already at a low. Some women teachers interrupt because it's past 5:00 and they come to collect their papers and things. I see a paper with a finger nail polish bottle attached to it. It belongs to one of the women. Another day I come to see a guest speaker working with the group. He's got a whole theory built around the shape of breads (rolls and buns) and the process of eating them. I listen as he talks about being real and connected with your feelings. The woman counselor sits next to me, very distraught and puts her head on my shoulder, weeping. It's too much to bear. He's fake, just like he's telling clients not to be. She cries, "I can't bear it," and tries to nibble at my lower lip for security. I stop her because it's not appropriate. (271 words)

I am dreaming, I am aware I am working through that old question of am I a latent lesbian. In the dream I am very sexually hungry and I present an image of a naked woman and I feel sexually excited. Then as an experiment, I present an image of a cat and I feel equally excited. So the conclusion is that when I'm sexually awake, any image will be colored in the sexual feeling. Maybe I shouldn't let myself get so needy and hungry. (85 words)

I am an older woman, 60's or 70's. I am also in incredible physical shape. I am a trapeze gymnast artist and Burt Lancaster is my partner. We are so right for each other. We only want to spend intensive time together, obsessing on each other. There isn't room for anything or anyone else. We kiss, we speak poetry of love to each other. We make love, hug, fondle and caress. There is no world beyond our world of intense love of each other. It feels wonderful. We do our trapeze act together, flying around and doing flips and turns in perfect synchronicity. The act is beauty in motion. When the act is over, we simply are together, loving, 24 hours a day. There is something about him having an affair with a woman and that hurt, but I just intensified my loving to such a degree, there was no time, thought or need for another, only me. Now we are getting married. I am in a beautiful white dress and as we are walking up the aisle. I whisper to him, "I'm pregnant." He is thrilled and I am too, at peace. Now all is complete. I'm also a little amazed at the fact that I can get pregnant, because we're both so old. We spend months, maybe years together, and then he builds a bicycle, a special one that is fast and efficient. I set out on a bike trek, alone. It is for some reason important that I separate from Burt for a period of time, maybe to prepare for when he dies and I am left alone. So I pedal on down the highway. I stop at a gas station and while there, a man in a souped up flashy car with a yellow fringe top that has a smart mouth roars in, fills up and roars out. At first, I'm annoyed at his seeming insensitivity, his maleness and immaturity. Then I find it amusing and decide to try and catch up with him on my bike to observe him more. I pedal quickly and see a crowd stopped on a bridge observing something in the sky. I stop, because I have to, they block the road. I look up and see two rockets taking off, one chasing the other through the sky. It's a NASA launch and has something to do with relationships. I watch and then speed on my way, through the crowd to catch this man in the car. Next I'm on a freeway with cars and other bikers. I pass them all, feeling strong and fast. Now I've come to the river and see the other side. That's home, where Burt is and I miss him. I see I'll have to backtrack to get on the bridge and that will make me lose time finding that car. I then see an entrance ramp close by and pedal up it gathering speed to merge with car traffic. I speed across the bridge very confident and fast. I don't really care about the car anymore. I miss Burt. I stop at the other side at a book stall on the side of the road. I see a book that was given to me by Burt and I fall on the books, happy, rolling around in them like they were water. I want to buy them all and my daughter sees another book, only purchased here, that I'll want and she tries to buy them for me. I want to hurry back to my beloved Burt and happiness. (593 words)

I'm in a rectangular room. A man "Briggs" is the investigating agent to find out what had killed my mother. As I watch him, I realize he's actually the one that murdered her, and he's going to get me too. I am left alone in this room with him. He goes outside to get a huge black pig and brings it in to kill me. I accept the challenge and reach for a metal stick, like my brake lever on my chair. Then I reach on the wall for a white dust pan. He rushes me and I try to force the dustpan up his throat. As we fight, he becomes a tiny white piglet and I roust him out of the room. (123 words)

I see several tiny pink bottles shaped like pigs. They have perfume in them. They are in a row (two of them). Somehow the message of the dream means I am a pig and creating the problem. I spill a gift bottle of perfume. (44 words)

I'm seated in the driver's seat of a bus (school bus taking lots of kids on some field trip). A man, the leader of the tour says we need someone to drive the bus. He looks at me. I say, "No thanks. I haven't got a license." He scoffs, saying I'm just a chicken. I try again to explain to him it's not legal and they could get sued. He just looks at me, smiling sneering. I give up and say, "OK OK." I feel the foot pedals (small metal squares like in an old tractor or car); I grind the gears. We start to go down a steep, curvy dirt road. We gather up speed as we go and I keep putting on the brakes. The men are talking behind my back, "She's doing pretty good," "Good for you." We come to a train track, blue plastic ones like on a game. He tells me to drive up on one. I turn and do so. He says that's the wrong one. I back up, the bus is now a series of kiddie cars and its hard to back up. The men are surprised how well I manage it. He points to another track, again the wrong one. He shakes his head like, "What am I going to do with you?" and then expresses reluctant respect when I manage to back us up. It's like he knows I can do it but is testing me. I get the right one on the third time. My kiddie car locks onto the track, but the others don't. I wait while they go back to get them locked on. Then my car lurches forward like on a roller coaster ride, alone. I look back, worried. He waves and says, "Oh, well, you'll be all right." I'm not convinced. I go down this steep incline in a tunnel fast. I am stopped by a stack of breakfast cereal boxes. He peeks down and says that will hold you. He leaves and of course they start to give and I go down and down and around and out. He's there. Each child is given a disability to emulate and experience on the next ride or challenge. He looks at me and grins. "You're dumb," he says. I get up on the train engine side and hold the metal handles, "OK," I say, "I'm dumb." He gets in the engine and he tells his female assistant, "Pick the first dumb one," knowing it would be me. She starts to pick one in front of me and I point out to her I'm the dumb one. She takes me to a run that is in front of the train engine and crosses the tracks. I have to run as fast as I can. If I don't do it fast enough, I'll be squished to death. I stand there thinking, "I can't run fast, I can barely move. What will I do?" I think of tricking them by running out of bounds, but I am supposed to be dumb. As I'm thinking, other people do their runs. One tries the out-of-bounds trick. It doesn't work. One slows down deliberately and gets caught. Two metal gates close on her and pretend to squish her. I begin my run. I do the best I can, but I limp and am slow. I push hard and cross the line 1/2 second before time is up. I lay on the ground sobbing at my pain. The man runs from the train over to me, concerned, just like I wanted him to. He scoops me up in his arms, reassures himself I'm unhurt and cuddles me. I relax in his embrace. He loved me all along.

I am at a dance. I am perfectly beautiful, perfect proportions, long blonde hair. All the men want me. They keep cutting in. One man rushes up to me and says, "Tell them you choose me, for now." I hesitate. Is this going to be beneficial to me? Which man should I choose for my best interests? I do choose him temporarily. We dance. I decide I like him the best. He's sweet and sensitive. An older man, distinguished gray hair, like in soap operas is very powerful, but I don't like him. He wants me and tries to convince me to choose him. I am stand-offish. He is angry at me. I then choose to sit on a bench with a young disabled woman and her mother. We chat. I feel like I'm "slumming." I'm aware of a "better than you" attitude. I then get up and go pick up a 17-year-old disabled man and carry him in my arms like a child while we dance. I am waiting for my love to return. He comes in, looking like Abner, with four of his brothers and sisters. They are playful and laughing together. I am glad I'll soon be a part of their nice family. He comes over and I then dance with him. The older man is after us. He'll cause us injury or harassment if he can. We go down to the end of the room. The older man has placed a long mechanical/animal creature under the table. I pick it up at the back of the neck to prevent it from biting me. It curls up and manages to almost get me. I search for and find a button on its right side. I use my left hand and push it; it turns the creature off so I am safe now. (305 words)

I am a member of the war underground. Burt Lancaster is the officer in charge. I must go on a mission, using my best sexual charms to allure an enemy to give info. Burt loves me, so this is hard for him. I love him and feel that duty is stronger than my love. I know I must sacrifice his good feelings toward me. Two old, fatherly men help me get dressed up like a matador's dressing ceremony. They are pleased with how lovely and alluring I look. They beam with fatherly pride. They pull open the curtains so the awaiting platoon of soldiers can see me. There is a pause as they are so overwhelmed with my sexy beauty. Everyone approves except Burt, who'd like this beauty for himself. I go up to the streets. After the mission is over, I am returning to the underground. I step into a tiny toilet room. I see flowers floating in the bowl. I flush them down as a signal that I'm ready. Next I step into the bowl and flush myself down the toilet. I am concerned. I won't fit, I'll get stuck and drown. The water comes to my lips and I say, "Go slowly," even though I feel like it should go fast so I won't drown. Then the "other me" gets up off the toilet and goes out, the door a heavy slab of wall that falls into the street. Two young boys (street urchins) put it back. I walk into a store and see a young woman being chased by the police or secret service man (store detective type). She runs toward the back of the store and is blocked by a grand piano in a window. She's very upset and then decides to go around it to the right. She's now in the back work room where the elves put things together. The head elf (fatherly like the men who dressed me) sees her and says to the other elves, "See her?" Do anything she asks as if she were me." They agree. He lets her pass to the secret entrance to the underground. I say, "And me too?" He smiles and says, "And her too." (370 words)

I am a part of a crowd of college graduates that are taking a traditional walk out to a point on a peninsula. There are so many of us that every inch of land is covered. We are wearing caps and gowns, all black. As we walk, different speakers give eloquent speeches of tradition - history, philosophy, etc. All the knowledge as it has been, being repeated word for word as it always has. No one can speak or interrupt or change the words. We solemnly walk to the very end. Some of the people on the outside edge, I am one of them, are almost pushed off into the water, it's so crowded. We turn and walk back. Now there are long tables set up for the banquet. I walk down (on the table) to find my place. I see Michael J. Fox seated opposite. I pause, we look at each other with speaking, glances, we love each other but I am married to Howard. He's actually the graduate here; I'm a student wife. I continue on to the end of the table. Howard and I sit. Now it is time for everyone to write new knowledge, ideas, and the best one will be chosen and read for all to hear. The male announcer says, "Doyle" (the paper chase lawyer-teacher). He stands. The announcer says, "There was a tie. One more, who isn't actually a student, but a wife." He calls my name and I stand on the table, surprised, pleased and concerned that my husband will feel outdone. (260 words)

My "baby" is sick. So Howard takes her across the street to the doctor's office. I wait and then get worried. I should have gone with them. I look in the window and see them seated, waiting. I go in, but I can't find them now. I ask a woman clerk where the doctor's. office is. She won't tell me and I push past her and go looking. I find a series of curtained off cubicles Howard and the baby are in one. I join them, sitting by where they are lying down to wait for the doctor. (98 words)

I am sharing a room with four other people - Aunt Elaine, Uncle Benjamin, me and one other woman. It is confusing at first who all is supposed to be in this room. Aunt Elaine says there are three beds, so three of us can stay. Uncle Bus leaves. At first I only see one bed, but I decide to believe on faith that there are three. I turn and see two more single pink beds on the far wall. I also see two more sliding doors, and through a crack I see more beds, one with a plaid coverlet, and I see the movement of someone's knees and realize someone else has that room. I see a door that could lead to a bathroom. We are at a sort of retreat and we each have to take a turn at cleaning up after a meal. The food isn't very good and Aunt and I decide (her suggestion) we go to town to have dinner. I think about the added expense and the waste, but agree. I am now looking through a book. It has some pictures of young boys and men. The other woman likes one of the pictures and wonders who it is. I look through to see if I can find more information. I see the name Hans Solo. I chuckle because that's from "Darth Vader" movies and mention that my Aunt had a different memory connection to the name. The number 512 is mentioned and I can't remember why the number seems familiar. (257 words)

Now I'm in a room full of women. They are all talking and laughing. They throw dice. I am annoyed, perhaps tired and sleepy, and suggest that I throw the dice and if I win, they have to clear a quadrant of the room so I can have it to myself to sleep and have quiet. They are insulted but agree. I throw two big fluffy dice and I can't count the round black buttons correctly. At first it looks like 8 or 9. Then a woman says its 4 20's. That means I won. Someone suggests I go out and sleep in the hall, where one of the dice had rolled. I am agreeable; it's further from the noisy chatter; but I stay in the room and sleep on my quadrant that I won. I wish they'd quiet down so I could sleep (curled up on the floor.) [BL] (149 words)

I am at my station/office in a hall-like room. A woman next to me has started work today so she doesn't know too much about how things run. We are setting up some display that is important. She has a great big female doll, sort of a floppy stuffed cloth doll. I have a male doll, a design in black rock on metal. It is much smaller than the female doll. We each go to place the dolls on this table, box, altar place. Her doll takes up most of the space and I disapprove. My doll is the King (Jesus?), after all, and more important. While I am adjusting them, this man comes up and talks about his disability and how hard it is. I am annoyed at him. He's obviously feeling sorry for himself. My disability is obviously much worse than his, but I try, somewhat absentmindedly, to talk with him sympathetically. I go back to my "office" area. It's nearly quitting time. The phone rings and this same man says, with admiration in his voice, "I'm the one you helped, the one with the bunny leg in a cast," meaning his disability was so slight, if it existed at all, that he had a stuffed bunny's leg in his cast. He thinks I'm wonderful and helped him so much. I am embarrassed and thank him for the positive feedback. It's not often people take the time to tell me I did a good job. I look down at the bandage on my thumb (left one). It is now soaked in blood. I am concerned and end the phone conversation. I point it out to the woman next to me (the one new to the job), and she unwraps the gauze. The tip of my thumb has an oval shaped hole in it and is bleeding. I decide I need to go see the Doctor about this. I'm aware it's a minor cut but I'll feel better if a doctor looks at it and bandages it right. So I walk through halls, turning here and there. I come to a place where if I turn right, I go downstairs to the University Dr. (An.) and the plays. (Jock is there and for a moment I think he's Dr. An. Jock looks like a bearded wimpy counselor from OCA.) I choose to turn left, upstairs, to the community college doctor's clinic. As I'm walking upstairs, I pass rooms where operatic concerts are being performed. I see two people standing on the steps listening. I see a cat curled up on a carpeted stair sleeping. I think it's nice, I can hear the concert as I pass by. I then get to the top and have to step over a low counter to get to the right corridor. I realize the blood has stopped by now and it seems silly to go on and see the doctor, but I decide to anyway. They can wrap it better than me. (499 words)

I am renting a room at this woman's house. I come home and the Chinese cook (male) and the other woman boarder and the owner are already there. They are eating dinner and each one sniffs the food before eating, because it's been leftovers so long that we aren't sure its still good. I say, "It's pretty bad when you can't relax and trust your food." The woman boarder, the cook and I all share a room. Now I see that the owner has another room we didn't know about. She stores some of her extra furniture in it. I suggest she let me have that room. She reluctantly agrees. Now the cook is like that actor/cowboy with lots of teeth in the Big Valley. John Candy is the woman boarder's boyfriend. Her name is Susie, she's young pretty and stupid, kind of. The three of us sleep together. I turn to John Candy and say, "Can we talk?" He agrees, but looks scared like I'm going to say something serious or negative. I laugh and reassure him it's not going to hurt. I ask him if he could be my friend. He laughs and says, "We're sleeping together and you want to know if we can be friends?" I laugh. By now we've agreed he and I are sleeping together alone, but just as plutonic friends. We cuddle and giggle like teens. I feel something wet on my nightgown and realize it is semen emission, either leakage or he had an orgasm. We both start giggling uncontrollably like teens in a library. It's so ironic that we've agreed to be friends, and sleep together and then he has an emission. Now the cook/old boyfriend is mean. He searches through my drawers of clothes to read my diary and then holds the material over me to keep me in line. John Candy is watching him from the hall. Now the cook/boyfriend sees John and starts to blackmail him. He says in a syrupy voice, "So are you still employed?" John says yes. He says, "Do they need you, Preacher? You are a preacher, aren't you?" John smiles and grabs his arm and says, "It won't work. You'll have to leave us alone. He (boyfriend) is thwarted and leaves, skunking like a villain. (382 words)

I'd try to force my eyes open. Once they opened and I fell asleep again. Then I found a toilet and a huge stream of urine rushed down my leg, puddling on the floor. (75 words)

It's Halloween and I'm looking for something in the house to give so I won't have to go to the store and buy more. The rooms are long and full of furniture (see drawing). At least the kitchen has at least three sets of tables and chairs. The living room is spacious. I find containers of hard candy and taffy left over from a year ago and decide to use that, but I see some spots on a sheet of candy and wonder if its moldy and spoiled. I decide not to use it, just in case. I go to the door. The children come in, having been trick-or- treating. They have huge bags filled with candy. I think about asking if I can give it away to trick and treaters, but decide that wouldn't be fair. I see Jake babysitting the babies. He's working hard. I invite him to join us in the living room where there's more room and more fun. I see one of the tables in the kitchen area is gone and am glad to have more space. I have bags of old pretzels and cheese puffs to give to the trick and treaters, but they are small. I hope I have enough to go around so I won't have to go to the store and spend money and get more.

I am part of a hidden minority group. We have escaped and we're on a mission. We run out in a group to the library or museum of modern art. We get in and realize we need to hide because the police/citizens are coming in looking for us. Several others and I get in a cabinet (like my video cabinet). The doors keep popping open a bit and sometimes the box isn't even there, although we all act as if it is. I can see the citizens (women) and hope they can't see me. Finally, they leave and we get out. I've split from the group to go where each one of us is supposed to go to get our mission accomplished. I go up a steep flight of stairs. It is difficult. I reach the top and see there is no opening for me to get to the 2nd floor. It's like the stairs curled up over itself. I keep trying to visualize it open. I struggle and finally arbitrarily declare myself on the 2nd floor. After a bit, I am. Now Bonnie and I are at the card catalogue table and I see instructions for how to duplicate/copy the cards you want. I pick up a pile of pink waxed paper covered cardboards (like thermofax paper). You put a roll of film in one card and lay it on the pink film and wait 2-4 minutes and peel off the pink film. I touch the pink film and start to lift it up. I ask Bonnie if she's loaded the film yet. She hasn't. Now I am a young boy and all the other patrons are older retired women. Someone asks what I'm doing there. I am so out of place with these retired people. I hope I'm not noticed before I finish my mission. I now look through cards that look like postcards, upside down, with pictures of animals on them. I'm looking for the ones I came to find. (333 words)

Jock and I are talking. He is gentle. He says its time to go to Dover. I say, "Yeah. The only things holding me here are the playwright class and Ellie and Charla." Then I look in my purse for my pills. I have a hard time finding them. I had changed purses and they had fallen out of their bottles. I finally eat all the right ones. Now I'm crossing a street. A woman walks with me on the left (Kern, the stage manager of "Fame" at the community college). She gently pushes me toward the right in a curved line and points to cars coming down a hill. "We'd be safer on the right." I agree and move. Now I see a row of motel/apartment rooms. They are plain and small. I go in one and try to turn down the stereo so it won't disturb the neighbors. The knob is wobbly and nearly comes off. Ellie says to Samantha (her roommate), "You can have her old stereo," (or she asks me if Samantha can have it). I'm a little upset, I'd been thinking of selling it for extra money and didn't appreciate her cavalier appropriations. (198 words)

I am in bed with a young, good-looking man. He is getting sexually excited. I can feel his penis growing hard next to my thigh. I am sleepy and don't want to make love. He tries to embrace me and I say no. He persists and I feel frustrated. I say, "Don't." Finally I realize he won't give up and leave so I throw myself on the ground next to the bed to sleep there. He gets up and leaves. Some woman is in the next room cooking. I get back in bed, wondering if he'll come back and take up where he left off. I am annoyed a little angry and a little smug because I won. Now I'm the director of this scene with two men and a woman, the same man and another one. I've decided to change or rewrite the scene and I know this will not be good news for the other male actor (looks like Howard at dream workshop) because I'm cutting him out. I say, "Let me see the scene." The man comes in. The other man is there, on the bed. The woman comes in, she's wearing a plastic brace under her chemise and I feel embarrassed and stop the scene. It's a lumpy hook thing on her back and I don't want the scene to go to the point that it is revealed as they take off her clothes. I have a hard time telling this guy he's out and I'm rewriting the scene. Now I'm in the passenger side of the car. I've asked an Aunt to make me something. My mother's standing outside the car glaring in; all I see is her disapproving face. I yell at her, "Leave me alone. I'll do this." I feel some guilt that I'm taking advantage of my Aunt. My mother certainly thinks so. She's telling me I should not ask my Aunt to go to all this trouble. I say to mother, "I'll ask her how much and I'll pay her." I realize guiltily that I'm relying on my Aunt's generosity to say, "No charge" and I won't pay her. My mother nags at me and I yell, "Leave me alone. I'll take care of this." She is upset with me. Now two young women come up to look at a black box (cook stove) with a small red button in the center of the front wall. As they look, I have a paint brush and I try to touch up a few spots with black paint. The young man is around somewhere. (431 words)

I am auditioning for a play. A woman holds a male black and white spotted cat in her arms. The cat is soft and sweet and affectionate. He licks her cheek, giving her a bath. I smile and hold out my arms. I've decided to cast this cat for sure. I hold him and pet him. He is so joyful to be around. I am very happy to have him. As I am petting him and aware of the softness of his fur, a young girl (woman) with short, dark hair auditions. I know she wants the mother part, but I've already cast that to another actress. I say, "Would you be willing to play the daughter part?" Her name is Kitty. She doesn't want to, but I know she'll change her mind later and it will all work out. (140 words)

I'm at a sort of beach in a badlands kind of landscape. I'm looking at it through my camera with the telephoto lens, taking pictures. I see water waves spraying up among the rocky shapes off in the distance. There are people on the beach and it's somewhat crowded. It's also kind of muddy. I need to leave there, perhaps some eruption or danger is possible. A man and myself (who is sort of Justin and Lucy) needs to get away and are being held back somehow (a bad guy). They are finally permitted logs (sawed off segments, maybe four or five of them stacked). They go to the river and throw them in and ride them like a horse, their feet, with shoes on, underwater (dragging their feet). They float down this huge, wide green river, feeling pretty clever at their use of the logs, rather than being burdened by carrying them. The woman also decides to keep near the shoreline. In case she falls off, she'll be able to swim in. But there are rocks and shallows, so they have to go out some distance to get around that. This is all working out fairly well, until the river changes. There are level changes (like giant steps or locks) (like in Panama Canal). They will have to get out of the river and carry their logs until they get past this part. There's something about a bus ride either taken or missed. Then she sees the river up ahead. It is rushing white water and big falls and rapids! They both agree it will no longer be OK to go down the river. So they walk. Now there is some bad guy. I think he is the owner of a shyster carnival set up. He says we have to shoot at a target to see our sharpshooting skills. Maybe we'll win (our freedom?). He points to a (see drawing) circle with a hole in it of green stone that is on a wall and moving in the breeze. He grins. I look again and see it's a (see drawing) pyramid-shaped stone and therefore hasn't a hole in it for the arrow to hit. I say, "No thanks. That's too hard. Not fair. I'll shoot at the dolly in the water-filled case." I see a case like a china cabinet of Grandma Agnes'. It is filled with water and in it is a fat dolly. The guy agrees/laughing. He tells the dolly to get out. She goes out the back door and as she's shutting the door, her "fat suit" padding gets caught in the door. At the breasts, three or four breasts of the padding is all caught in the door. Now the pad floats off the dolly and floats in the water. The real dolly comes in, her porcelain face old-fashioned and sweet. She has ringlets. She stands at the back of the case waiting for me to attempt to shoot her. Now a padded sheet (like over a piano) is all over the case so I can't see where the dolly is. The guy asks, "Want to get up closer?" It's like he's being generous, but he's really not. I smile with confidence and say, "No thanks." I aim my bow and arrow sort of at a cloth toy mouse and shoot. My tiny arrow looks like it's missed because it hit at the front of the case. When the padding is opened, it is revealed that this tricky guy had the dolly move to the front, so my arrow had pierced her ear. I had won, just barely. But I had won. We were free to go.

I need to go to the bathroom. I see a hole in the floor of my house. This whole house is large, but it's only one room with no walls. It's very open. I try to squat down and pee, being careful to try and hit the hole. It's got some water in it like a toilet in a train or plane. The hole moves and I walk, crouched, to keep up with it. It moves to the edge of the floor and changes to a grid covered like square. I'm glad because now I can sit on the edge and let my legs dangle over the edge in a more normal position. I pee. I see the outdoors and kids playing off to the left. I feel embarrassed and see a shower curtain. I reach over and pull it to me, closing it. One slit is left open at my left. I still see the kids playing but, oh well. I get up and examine my "toilet." It's a briefcase with metal grid lines. I think, "It's odd to use a nice leather briefcase like that," and I think about removing it and using it as a briefcase. I see another case with compartments in it, all in a row (see drawing). I see matches and matchbooks in it. Dwight comes over and we hug. I remember it's been along time since we've hugged, touched or made love. I want to hug him, but remember he's my brother and so it would be wrong. Now Lydia and her family come in. I am aware of the toilet thing and worry they can smell urine. There is something about Caroline standing there and her father Doug nearby. Now, a whole parade of people are coming in. It's a party and there's something about my father, maybe it's his parade, or it's for him. There are lots of happy people. Tony Curtis is there. We talk. He's smiling at me. He kisses me. I feel shy. The parade or crowd swarms into the house and Tony and I go out for a walk. As we're walking and talking, I see some tacky looking houses. I stop and laugh. Tony asks why I'm laughing. I say, "This is supposedly the 'south hills' of this town and look how silly, tacky, bad these houses are." We look around. I see poorly made miniature pieces with huge screws in them instead of tiny little nails. I see a house (see drawing). We laugh at this house. We're then in another open kind of house and an older man (maybe two) and a 13(?)-year-old girl are talking. The man sees us and waves goodbye to the girl saying, "I was just kidding about 'Doing It.'" The girl comes into the house and I say, "You'd better not 'do it' with him!" She says, "Don't worry, I won't." She's annoyed with me for even thinking she'd get snookered by this guy. She's pretty capable and knowing. (500 words)

Nate is back. He calls me Bridgette and is trying to make himself useful so he can hang out with us. He sort of ignores me. I feel a longing to hug and kiss him, but he's too busy moving things around. It's kind of a refection of me, especially when he deliberately calls me Bridgette. I say, "It would help if you called me by the right name." I know he's pretending he's mixing me up with another of his women. Another woman called Sonja tells him to straighten up the books. I see a shelf of very large "oversized" books. It's Howard's and my collection. Nice books: Art, Cosmos, etc. Then she tells him to go find out the name of this crip talking rock she hands him. "That's too hard," I say. He leaves the room in search, looking at me like "Oh, yeah? Too hard, huh? You'll see. I can do it." He comes back in with an opened book on rocks. He's holding the rock up to a picture and they are identical. He calls it a long Latin-like name. I am surprised he could find it. He then takes off his shirt, maybe to get down to work. I notice he's gained some weight and it looks good on him. I want to go hug him and cuddle, but he moves on. He's now straightening up the magazines on the coffee table. One is Life Magazine and the front cover picture looks alive. It's an astronaut that had the front part of his skull removed and electrodes put on his brain, raw and red, so he can be monitored as he's out in space. It's gruesome looking. (283 words)

I am reading newspapers. They are very large print and huge pages, the comics and stories. I'm in a room with other people. Now I'm outside a room and sneaking up on the window. The bad guys are in the room, waiting for me. We are going to fight. I am trying to make the odds more even by opening the windows. I'm hiding that fact by placing the cream colored drapes and the cardboard place forward so they can't see they are open. Somehow I win if I fight and then get this pile of money and papers on the window seat out the window after I arrange this. Myself and several others go in and the fighting starts. One big football guy crouches and points to his balls, daring me to kick them. I know I'd be a fool to do so as he'd grab my foot and throw me around. I have a pair of scissors and I slash out, cutting people with it. I then rush to the window and shove out the papers and money. I've won. Now I come around to the door and tell them all to line up in pairs. We're walking over to the superintendent's office to get a lecture and see the museum. It's a way of keeping them busy so no more fights erupt. I see two good-looking young men. One is in a beige suit coat, the other is in back. "You too, eh?" I say. "I might have known." They had started this whole thing. They crowd up real close to me, teasingly aggressive. I march us all to the next building and as we are walking past it, someone comments, "That's his house, that part. He lives here at the school." I see black glass windows (smashed), modern furniture. There is a sense of him using the system. I crowd everyone in; there are lots of them like in a library area. I go to the super's office door and catch him just as he's trying to sneak out. (Jerry Van Dyke's, brother of Dick Van Dyke). I say, "Oh no you don't," and make him come over to talk. I know he's only going to talk a few minutes and I want it to last all afternoon; otherwise what else would I do with them? They are a high school crowd. A shy girl is there. She wants to leave. I don't let her. (409 words)

I am living in my car. I'm in the driver's seat. I notice lots of broken glasses and cups on the floor. I am annoyed at Ellie for making this mess, carelessness. I try to reach down and pick up some, but it's too hard. I start to back the car out of its spot. I am parked too close to an older black car (the Mercury?) I wonder if I scratched the paint on the car or made a dent. I also notice my green van on the right. I then get out of the car and walk downtown to see what I can see. The sidewalk is uneven, like old bricks or cement. I stop to look in a store window at dresses. I see a fat skirt, some ugly dresses. I notice in the reflection of the window a man is standing next to me - some creep, no doubt. He's talking to me. I'm annoyed. I turn and walk away and I see the end of the road. There is a huge ocean with ocean-going vessels out there. The waves are huge and crashing and cold. The oil tanker-like ships are rusty. I feel fear and revulsion. I don't want to see it and I turn and walk away towards that man even though I don't want to see him either. I notice another (street?); I go there only to see a rugged vacant lot with junk and a burnt-out foundation of a house. I think to myself, "I wonder what these symbols mean." I notice the negative aspects and feel a reluctance to examining the meaning. Just my luck, hard and negative symbols. I see the burnt-out house and feel resigned. I see some children nearby. I see a person who looks at me and waves and I am unaware that I'm actually waving to myself. My dream self is waving to my waking self. I am amused and impressed with myself. (327 words)

I'm looking for my pills. Ricardo and Rigo are standing in my daily pill boxes. I move pills from Rigo. He's too young and might take some. I have trouble distinguishing between the pink ones and the peach-colored ones. Howard comes to bed, Ernie like, wearing black bikini briefs like Kevin Kline who reminds me of Barry S. Ginny is around. I'm pregnant. I lay down on a hospital bed. A doctor puts his hand on my belly. No pain yet, but there will be soon. The doctor might have a gay lover. There's a pair of shoes on the floor. I see an open door to another hospital room and hear a little girl crying out, "Daddy, daddy, there were these lights." She'd been dreaming and was afraid, running down the hall to her daddy's room. I thought to myself, "Listen to her, you jerk. She needs to know she's OK." He doesn't. He says, "Yeah, yeah," like she's making up a story. I feel sad for her. I see a creature that opens his mouth and moves his tongue out to greet me. It lives in a bowl. It looks like a shrimp thing (and like Audry II in Little Shop of Horrors) I ask, "Can't it get out?" concerned because it needs water and I don't see very much and if it gets out, it could dry up. He likes me and recognizes me when I am near. I bring him a present: a box of Kleenexes, a purse-size one in a plastic wrap. He loves it and comes out and eats some. Then Ginny opens its mouth and pulls out a string of white stuff and puts it on the table. It wiggles around. The creature says, Where is it?" Ginny says, "Over there." It says, "It has changed form (meaning been born)." I see it looks like a tiny white elephant. It's a baby. Everyone wants to help me and I then realize, "Oh, right, I forgot. When you last saw me, I was in a wheelchair and pregnant." I'm walking fine now. (348 words)

I am at work/school and tired. I want to go home and look around to see if things are done. I notice that I haven't finished my work for the day. There are clothes to be folded and put away. I sigh and go get it done. I separate the skirts, the underslips and the tops into different piles. I find pieces of a dress pattern pinned to a cork board at the bottom of the laundry pile. I start to take the pin out and put the pattern away, but can't remember if the person making the dress has cut the cloth yet. So I leave it, just in case. I now feel ready to go and can't find my purse. A young man walks in and I abruptly ask him what he wants. I realize a class will be coming in soon. Ellie is hanging around not being helpful. I can't find my car keys and I see more clothes to put away. I feel tired and frustrated. I remember the purse is in the closets among more piles of clothes. Dream work: bars of jail and bars (as in taverns) and bars of music long (horror?) jail could be coffin, the living dead. "Let me out" appears in both titles! (213 words)

I and my companion come to the house to try and kill a dragon who had been threatening me. I am worried because I don't know which way he's coming from. I can't protect front and back. We are at a window looking into this house. Now, later, inside the house, a group of people are also afraid of the dragon. They form a circle and each one alternating, facing front or back so all sides are protected. One smaller one isn't holding hands and it's looking up the chimney. I worry that he will wander away and leave us vulnerable. Now the dragon (like my stuffed dragon) flies down and looks in the window and says, "Come out or I'll kill you." I laugh, "No way!" The dragon says it won't do any good for us to resist because he'll just breathe in smoke into the house and we'll have to come out. I, he says, won't. "By the way, we'll get your brother too." I feel fearful that he's right, but I stay in the house. My brother (me) outside the house walks. He had my capacity to see in all directions. (194 words)

My mother is on her knees by my bed and she's very intense. I get up and leave, telling her not to be so intense around me. "A circle complete." A man wins a red convertible "scat wagon" car. I admire it and we agree we'll both own it. I say, "I like to drive." He's happy because he doesn't like to drive. It's a perfect symbiotic relationship. I am driving. I stop to say goodbye to a friend. (79 words)

"Alcoholism is a disease of the brain and I find it hard to leave." Nate's wife is mad. I go to a house and walk in. Nate is there. I am wanting to go hug him and aware that I should leave. We talk as I struggle with my torn feelings. Then his wife walks in and Nate, standing behind me, puts his arms around me, sort of a hug and sort of to restrain me from leaving in a playful, serious way. He says my name loudly several times and I'm embarrassed. Now he's done it. She'll recognize me for sure. She does. She is angry that I am back. Nate hangs on to me as I try to get him to release me. She and I talk. She is angry and I am trying to be plain now. I did not know he was here and accidentally came to the door. She doesn't believe me. So why don't I leave then, if my intention sare honorable. She tells me, "Alcoholism is a disease of the brain." He's a sick man and I must leave. I'll make it worse for him. I know she's right and find it hard to leave. A younger woman is in the room. I finally get him to let go of me. (218 words)

My father and I are looking at things. I walk over to a road, a dirt road, and I say, "Oh! look, it's Springdale," one of my Uncle's house. I see the dirt driveway and a grassy bank. I say, "Look, it's like it was long ago" (perhaps when I was a child). Suddenly there is an earthquake. I see the dirt breaking up and rolling down the grassy bank. "An earthquake," I say. My father comes to look as the road transforms to a staircase; the left side of it is now the dirt bank. My father and I go stand on it to look. Several people stand right on the edge and the edge crumbles and they jump down. One man says to us, "Careful." My father says, "Let's go look." He jumps down on the stairs. I lean over and he holds his arms up for me to jump. "Are you sure?," I ask. He smiles and says, "Come on." I then jump down into his outstretched waiting arms. He catches me and we laugh. He hugs me and we hold hands. It's very affectionate and warm (he is 68 years old like he is now). We go down the stairs into a room. On the left is a beautiful, ornate piano. He asks me to step through a golden, wired design I could walk through to sit on a chair and listen as he plays his piano. He goes up a few stairs to play the piano. I try to bend down and walk through the wire devices. It keeps bumping my head until I am finally on my hands and knees and still won't fit. My father laughs and so do I. "Guess I won't fit here," I say. I walk over to where he's at the piano. He starts to get up to go fix the wire thing but I say, "No, I'd rather sit here anyway" (it's closer to him and the piano). Now we walk over to another room. There are dolls on the wall. He takes one off the wall and says she has to go to the dolly hospital. She's had her head severed. I make a word joke about how severe to sever with a head severing (something like that). He says, "He didn't quite understand that." (Elaine?) The dollies were gifts from an Aunt. He rearranges them. We walk on, back to the piano room. He looks up high on a wall and sees some little knickknacks and plaques. He says, "Hope you don't mind, but I think I'll take those down." I say, "Actually I've been wanting them down for a while. It makes the room look tacky." (The dollies were very high up too.) (458 words)

I am in bed with Rochelle. We haven't seen each other for a long time. She really likes me and respects me. She curls up with me, spoon fashion. It feels very warm and affectionate. I am aware that she is gay, but I feel comfortable and relaxed, not uptight and worried. I have a pack of cigs and fumble them. They fall out of my hand into a narrow dirt ditch by the side of the bed. I try and reach for them and end up sliding out of bed and reaching my arm down. I finally get them and get back in bed. Now Rochelle is laying sideways at the other edge so she can see me better. I feel a bit more comfortable that she's moved over there. We talk and I smoke. I want to put out the cigarette and she says, "There's an ashtray over there." She reaches for the cig. to take it over there for me. I fumble and it drops on the sheet. It rolls around, lit, and Rochelle tries to pick it up and it's hot and she keeps dropping it. I don't help very much. Then I go to look for a bathroom. I find one. Rochelle is talking about her lover, a young woman, and how hard it is to keep her. Now the scene shifts and I get in a chair (an ordinary office chair) to drive/fly away. It rises up above the street. I feel some concern as I feel where the backrest is before I lean back. It feels loose and precarious. I lean back carefully. Then I wonder how this thing can fly because it has no fuel/energy source. But it does. I'm going down the street and want to rise up higher so I can peek into the second story windows and see what people do and how they live. It does and I do. I get to an office. Two other women are waiting. The door opens and a black man says, "Who has an easy request?" I say, "I do," and I go in ahead of the others. I sit and he says, "Lots of times they say it's an easy one, but they turn out to be the most complicated." I grin in recognition and say, "You're right. Mine probably will too. Shall I go out and come back in?" He says, "No, what do you want?" I say, "Not much. I want to work with people on drugs and with AIDS and at a college level, but colleges don't pay very much. I want you to subsidize me." He asks, "How much?" I say, "$2,000." He asks, "Where do you want to work?" I say, "With the inner city kids. In Queens." He says it's unusual for him to be working with college level stuff, but he did have one dean still writing to him. I am aware I'm being selfless and asking for worthwhile stuff and he'll give me my request. I see his Negro mouth, huge lips, open in an "o". (513 words)

I am going to the White House to meet the President of the U.S. He is a bachelor. I have to go down to the basement and get clearance. I am aware in the dream of a feeling that I look very good and I am to be respected and then he will fall in love with me. I look around for the woman who gives clearance. She is not around. I am tempted to just go up the back steps, but decide to do it right so I won't get into trouble. I open a door and find the woman who is very fat, like 500 ton or 1,000 lbs. She is lying down and uncomfortable. There is a mirror near her head like a pillow. A man (her husband) sits behind her head, facing me. He's there to help her, a co-dependent, lazy kind of guy. She is grumpy but gives clearance (permission). I go upstairs. The President opens the door; he's talking to someone and turns and does a double take as he sees me. He's already interested. I come in confident. (185 words)

I am in bed. There is a little vivacious girl with me, bouncing around. My roommate (helper) and (Toni) comes in and is going to help me straighten up things in there. My other new roommate, a male named Tony, comes in and is "talking" to her. He touches her and leans into her like an Italian who is angry. There are sexual and aggressive undertones. He touches her top part of her chest. She tells him to please not touch her when he talks. That makes him more aggressive and belligerent. I sit up and say, "Tony, Tony, Tony," trying to get his attention. He ignores one and continues to push on her. I am firm and insistent. I say, "She's made it very clear that she doesn't want you to touch her. If you intend to stay here, you'll have to respect that and leave her alone." His attitude is one of, "I'm not doing nothing wrong," but he backs off. He looks like he is crying. I realize he's vulnerable. I get up out of bed and walk (well and with ease) over to him and say, "Tony, wait. I see you're feeling hurt. This isn't about you personally. You can still live here if you follow the rules." He says, " I'll think about it," and leaves the room. I'm pretty sure he is going to leave and I think for a moment. I'll have to give him back his $95 for rent and I could use the money. But oh well, if I must, I must. I shake my head, "How ironic. I got a roommate who was molested and one that molests." I hope it works out, but I am clear that he goes if he doesn't change. I can always get another roommate. I then walk to the closet. Tony follows me and asks what I'm doing. I say, "I feel like wearing a different dress today." I look at different ones. She shows me several purple ones I used to wear. I say "This one," and it's an old-fashioned green print dress with puffy yellow sleeves, sort of wagon days style. She says, "That sure is different, sweet and old-fashioned." She unbuttons several of the top buttons. I'm going to put it on. (381 words)

I am in a room. Mabel and several other women are there. I walk past them to talk with a man. One woman asks me why I chose to ignore Mabel and talk to the man, and why I am angry and being sarcastic. I feel angry that she accuses me of this and begin to explain that I wasn't angry. I simply wanted to talk to the man. I realize as I'm talking that the woman is right, and I feel caught and embarrassed. I take a deep breath and, still angry, I try to be honest. I say, "I apologize if I offended or hurt. I have old habits that I learned from my parents." I go on to explain about my mother, her anger and indirect ways of expression. I say, "I'm trying to change." (138 words)

A man is trying to seduce me. He is outside the house and crying to weasel his way in. I call 911. A woman officer comes in and asks questions. She wants to verify if I'm a federal employee. I say, "Yes, I am" but I am wondering if I'm really being accurate. She says formally, "I wish to apologize to you. It was our fault." Meanwhile this seductive guy is still in the house trying to get my attention. I resist him. A small baby girl starts to go happily toward him. He's encouraging her because then he'll have me. I try to prevent it and take the girl away. Another man is there (maybe Howard, husband type) and he takes the little girl for me. (127 words)

I am in a large house. High school friend Dora is visiting. She's in the living room. There are two women in the kitchen and I go between the two rooms back and forth to entertain Dora and to get things she needs from the kitchen area. I go into the bathroom, which is at the front of the house. It is made of brick. I can't get the door to shut completely. I see another door that leads to the living room. I go out and try to lock it. It has a lock with two holes that have parts that move down so that it looks like two eyes of a dolly shutting. The first try doesn't work and I do it again, only slower, and it locks. Then I return to the living room, and Dora and Duane are seated there. I then go to the kitchen and find the two women. They put on bridesmaid dresses and I am putting on the bride's dress. We will each take turns wearing it before we take it in to Dora who will be the bride at 8.00 p.m. I see my white satin top and the net petticoats and feel that the dress should be prettier than that and decide it will have a long satin skirt over the net. The two women, one dark-haired, bring the bouquets they had made - satin with a white gardenia. I am very impressed at their kindness in making these. The rest of the bride's bouquet is in the other room; I go to get it. I then see another room I didn't know was in the house, a bedroom where the dark-haired woman lives. I feel she's a CIA spy. It has no walls. I wonder if it gets too cold and rainy for her. I come out, headed for the living room, when Katrina comes and says we need to go get gas for the car. I agree because it would be nice to have all these details worked out so Dora's wedding goes smoothly. I am in the back seat; Katrina is driving. I notice we are going across a bridge to another state and realize she is going a long distance in order to use her Chevron card to pay for the gas. I say, "Hey, I didn't agree to this." She says it's best for her to do it this way. I say, "I think it will take too long and we'll be late to the wedding. I'd rather pay for the gas myself." So she agrees, but we have to stop at a bank first so she can do some transaction. She drives the car right into the bank and parks over by a wall and gets out. I am seated in the car (now a small child car) in my bride's dress feeling conspicuous and embarrassed. Someone I know (perhaps an ex-student) comes up to chat. I feel like an idiot and think, "Oh well, I'm disabled, like may be that will be explanation enough." I look at my watch it's 7.30. I say, "Let's go back now. I'd like to leave enough time to make sure we're not late." (536 words)

I am going to meet a woman. I have to give her some information from the counseling dept. I drive out to a building and part in the parking lot. I go to the building house where I think she is and knock on the door. No one answers. I see what I think is a mail man pouch and a dog is biting letters and holding them in his mouth. I am concerned that the woman will need those letters. I see it is a back pack/mail box. The dog's head is shaped like the point of a fountain pen. [It is a waking realization.] He's black and white. I try to shoo him away but he "doggedly" stays there. I don't want to be bit, so I don't grab for the letters. Now I see women coming out of the building and I notice I was at the wrong place. They had been meeting in another building behind the one I was knocking on. I see co-worker Juliet and others. I am supposed to deliver this in for from the library (the community college) and I can't remember the name of the woman I'm to give it to. I go "upstream" as the women come out and find the second building. I see another meeting going on and ask a woman (a co-worker) if this is the OCA meeting. She says no, they had been meeting in the other building I feel frustrated and go back to the original building I am in the small room I'd been knocking on and think this must be a telephone room. I go outside and walk to the parking lot. I see a dead, bloated horse lying in front of my van. How awful, but I can probably get around it. Then I see my van, which had been parked with both doors open, was gone. I'm tired and annoyed; I call the police. A male voice says," You can drive a manual shift?" I say, "I can drive very well. But it's an automatic shift." He hems and haws and I know he is not going to be helpful getting my van back. (358 words)

Capt. Jean-Luc (of Star Trek) is interested sexually in Dr. Beverly and vice versa. They are on the bridge. He suggests they go to her quarters. She is hesitant but willing. Her concern is that if it doesn't work out, there would be big problems because of their close relationship as captain and doctor. They would still have to work together. He overrides her concerns and they go to her quarters and don't even completely undress and attempt to make love. His penis is semi-flaccid and medium-sized. She expected it to be bigger. She strokes his penis and stomach, trying to unbutton his pants. Then she pulls him to her and he enters, but it is not as exciting as anticipated, they struggle and try, but it's just not working. She fakes an orgasm and they sit up. Her half grown son tries to lock the door for her so she'll have more privacy. Capt. sits up and says, "So, we won't be seeing each other like this again." Her feelings are hurt. Is he, after all, just like other men? She retaliates by saying, "I faked the orgasm." Now they are both hurt and the captain goes back up on the bridge. Later, she goes to change her clothes and chooses a uniform top that is yellow, a soft knit that will accentuate her form with lace around the attached hood. She feels this is incongruous with her feelings that it's all over. She goes up on the bridge. Everyone is expecting an alien visitor. She must prepare the proper environment for him. He's mostly invisible and the atmosphere he needs is a blue light. She reassures the crew if they encounter the alien's blue misty atmosphere, it will not harm them. The alien enters and wears large "sneakers" on his "feet." Doctor bends down to examine them, thinking they are too tight for the "ganglia." Captain watches her and makes a comment under his breath about how lucky "he" (the alien) is to have her touching him and being concerned. She sort of feels his remark. A slight sexual tension and teasing is going on. She decides the alien doesn't have to wear the sneakers after all (they are our species stuff) and takes out a soft slipper that he can wear instead.

Silly Hat, Bath Time. Ginny and Ernie are there and they are my gentle, caring, loving helpers. Ellie and I are there. My mother is there. I reach into a box of hats and put some on my head. I put a silly one on, green and white variegated yarn like a snug child's hat and the yarn ends close all around my face. I laugh and go show my mother. Ellie says, "I thought those were sleepers for Charla in that box." I said, "Don't worry, they are in the other box." Now it's time for my bath. My mother prepares it. I see Ellie putting Desiden on the diapers for Charla. My mother pays her every time she does it, in effect bribing her to take better care of her daughter. Oh well, at least it works. I see a man, a friend, we are very affectionate. He is getting ready to go back to his hunting hole. He says I have to build up some sweat so I can be a better hunter. I ruffle his hair affectionately like a boy's and smile. I say, "Hopefully you'll take a bath so I can get within 30 yards of you." I pause and then rush to reassure him, "I mean before the wedding, not now." He grins and says teasing, "Maybe I'll just stand 31 yards away." Somehow he is asserting his need to be true to his nature. I am trying to accommodate that. He leaves and I get in the bath. There is lots of soap. I realize it has been feeling good to take a bath every morning like I've been aroused to get me going. She's leaving today and I think, "I wish I'd continue this on my own without her there, gently pushing me," but I realize sadly I probably won't. (308 words)

I'm on a boat trip. I am with my "husband" who is like Darryl. Two couples are traveling together. We women get angry at the husbands. They just goof off and ignore us, so we decide to get divorced. Now we're ready to go back home. We walk upstairs and down and across a lobby. I see a boy/man in a wheelchair that looks like a big stroller. He's tipped over. People are walking past. Even though I am aware I have a disability (not in the dream), I reach over and help him up. Darryl also helps. He thanks us. I think how small his body is. Darryl is talking about us being together even though we're "divorced." I am tempted. I do love him and enjoy him. He keeps talking and repeats what he heard the other guy say about maybe it's true we're really lesbians and just want an excuse to travel together so we can be together. This makes me mad again. I look for my room, #15. Darryl follows me. I try to open the door. I push a big purple button. A water shower sprays out. I keep adjusting the spray to get it to stop, but it won't. I get frustrated and say something like, "Hey, I can't make this work." Darryl frolics in and pushes the button and it stops. I say, "How did you do that?" He says, "I don't know. It just stopped the first time I touched it." I go down a long narrow stairs with bits of wet pampers on the floor. I am amazed at how huge this room is and wonder if I've got the wrong one. The first one coming out was tiny and no bathroom. This one has separate rooms. I go into each room, exclaiming at the spaciousness and luxury. "Wait 'til you see all the pretty things in the bathroom," says Darryl. I run in to look. There are lots of knickknack shelves and groupings of tiny ceramic animals. There are a group of kitties, dogs, etc. I say, "Oh, look, I can take all these home." I am looking forward to looking at all my treasures. I go out and see more rooms. I see an open door. A stranger (female) stands looking in at me. The door then closes and I realize it's a connecting door to another cabin and it was left accidentally open and now is properly shut. (410 words)

I am in a house with Pat Brown. We are making love, on a wooden bench (like a pew). He's kissing me and lying on top. I'm getting excited. I think maybe someone will walk in so I say, "I think we ought to lock the doors," a glass side door and a front door. He's enjoying the sexual feelings and is reluctant to stop. Just then a woman, my "roommate," comes walking in the front door. She's dressed to go to church, wearing a hat and pulling on her gloves. Pat had slid down off me and my skirt is down enough that I am covered, and I hope we look innocent enough. But no, Pat is naked and his bare butt gives us away. She sees the situation out of the side of her eyes and pretends it's not happening and leaves. (Before this, I think, a bobcat was outside the glass doors and comes into the room. I think it's beautiful and am aware it's a wild animal and feel concern that I could be hurt. I want to pet it, and do, but am also trying to get it out of the room.) So Pat and I resume making love. He is only partially erect and has some trouble finding his way in to the vagina. He slides down and looks, poking around for the opening. I want him to quit fooling around and come in and have an orgasm. A small, red, furred kitty is outside the front door in the foyer and it belongs to my roommate. It prances out of her room to her in the hall and she pets it as she's leaving for church. Then the kitty comes to my room and comes up on the bench where Pat and I are. I pat it. I notice it has red eyes. It purrs and licks me, and Pat, with his eyes sensuously half closed, sticks out his tongue and licks the kitty once or twice. I want Pat to make love to me and I start kissing him, and then I realize he's done. He had orgasm and I am left sexually awake and frustrated. He sits up and gets up as my roommate is returning. I notice my diaphragm, wet with jelly, is on the bench and I try to slide it out of sight. It's stretched over a plastic breakfast bowl. I create a diversion, gather it up and give it to Pat. We go out of the room, talking, chatting and duck into the bathroom. I put the diaphragm on the shelf. It turns into or is next to a small black object, cylindrical in shape (see picture).

I am looking at an ornate picture that Paulina has drawn. I say to Kenneth, "Look at this. There is something sweet about her drawing," (ability). Then I see she is tracing pictures. I look again at her pictures and reassure myself there is still some original creativity there because after she traces the form, she adds her own work inside it. I see the outline of a woman and a crude, but compelling face like my drawing in art class. I see another drawing of "Rose," a woman who looks like me, that Rochelle drew. Someone says, "Look, it looks like you in the face." Rochelle must have been thinking of me when she did it, perhaps unconsciously. I want to hold "Rose" and meditate for answers to what I'm doing to myself. I do so and I see a rolling muddy river with sticks in it. I laugh because I realize the symbols mean "she is beating herself up." The sticks then turn to turmoil and I know this means, "She is being shitty to herself, the trend." (180 words)

Warm Love, Shame And Healing. I am in love with Robin Williams and he with me. The only trouble is he is married. I am in a room I share with a female roommate. I am eating chocolate figures, all but the hats. My roommate asks didn't I know the hats were chocolate too? I said I didn't and pick up the little chocolate brim. I will go back and eat the other hats later. Robin comes in the door. I am glad to see him because I love him and desire him, and I am sad to see him because I must resist him because he is married. He tries to embrace me and kiss me. He is sweet and I want him, but I push him away. He is unhappy and realizes he must give up his wife so we can be together. Now I am happy and we hug and kiss deliciously. Now I am a fat business man who brings things to this bad gangster boss. I (the observer) feel sorry for him, but he looks at me (like I'm the TV camera ) and says, "I asked for it. I choose to do it." He feels resigned and guilty. He knows he is not a victim and chooses this degrading life style. The boss snaps his fingers and the man goes to get what the boss wants. Now I am a counselor on a couch talking with a young woman, my client. She is telling me how she can now be assertive and free with her own feelings and needs. She says I changed her whole life. I say, "No, I didn't, you did." She asks was the ability to change always then or did the counseling put it there? I say the natural ability was always there but the counselor gave skills and techniques that helped the natural ability to be used. We are all pleased with ourselves and each other. Robin is there too. (331 words)

Prom Dresses Over The Sink. I am in M City house. There is something about my parents. I go in the kitchen and see clothes hung up like in a closet only it's just across the kitchen area. I see several of my prom type dresses from high school, with scoop neck, bouffant skirts, blue, and one is yellow. I touch one and think it's rather course, cheap material, not like I remembered it.

Every morning someone brings me my little baby girl. She is so thrilled to see me. We hold out our arms for each other and she runs into my arms laughing and happy. We hug. After a few minutes, I hand her over to someone else and get busy with other things. She starts acting up to get my attention. (60 words)

I am standing in a neighborhood street with other women. A huge diesel truck pulls right up to us in an aggressive, belligerent way. It's a stand off. A very tall, strong, almost robotic Swartzenegger type gets out. They want to scare me, intimidate me. I do feel scared and know I must not back down. He looks way down at me and says, "I'll pick you up." I know this will hurt, but I still stay. He puts his hands and fingers right at the sides of the ribs and I'm not sure if his he is going to break my ribs in his grip or just tickle me to death. Either prospect is unpleasant to contemplate. He lifts me high up and I wait. Then I notice I'm in the tree tops and I reach up and grab some small, leafy branches and pull myself out of his grasp by going up in the direction he was putting me (sort of Tai Chi, going with the flow of energy). I scramble among the branches, hoping to find someone that is strong enough to take my weight and small enough (flexible enough to lean with my weight and ease me back down to the ground). I do find one and am back safely. I say to the woman, "Did anyone call the police?" And everyone scrambles around, grabbing telephones. Maybe ten calls went out to the police. This seems to intimidate the two trucks and they carefully back up the way they came and are gone. I now see Howard/my father. I feel strange because of the combination. Is he a peer or of the previous generation. How do I communicate and respond - with open ease or with respectful diffidence? Howard/my father says he is sad. Pete got a divorce and comes to live with him and he hasn't even talked about it with Pete. He should be better able to be emotional and open. I realize I've lived in the same house with Pete for some time now and haven't talked at all. I feel bad. Pete is coming to dinner and I want to talk to him about the divorce and feelings.

I am a Desert Storm soldier and am under dire straits and running for our own lives. In order to save myself, I must dig a hole in the sand and bury myself. I wake up and manage to breathe by carefully tuning my nose right at the surface. I wait. I am close enough to our own lines to see and hear the men talking. One notices me and I explain what's going on. He's an officer and he orders me to stay put until he tells me to move. Time passes, days, and I stay. I somehow manage to adapt and survive. I even figure out how to get food. A soldier comes by and brings me a piece of K-meat. I don't accept contaminated meat; however, I have standards, you know. So I see him take it to another soldier, a "cooks," and he tests it. First, it's old and then it's contaminated. He throws it out and gets me a good one, dropping it in my sand pile, pretending it as an accident. I sort of realize that if he can move around out there, I could too, but I wait. I have my orders. Weeks pass. I shift my position and re-dig a better hole. Now I see an older man, a mayor, a big wig who is returning to his home to see the enemy soldiers have captured his wife, a pudgy woman in a yellow dress. She's about to be executed. The line-up reminds me of a wedding party lined up at the alter. She sees her husband and says, "Run for it, they have got me." He knows he is doomed, but goes to stand by his wife anyway. She begs him to run. She would never forgive herself if he was killed on her account. What would the neighbors say? He doesn't speak, but stoically stands with her to be executed. Time continues to pass. I see some men waiting for a bus. My sand is more like at a beach now. A young woman is camping out near me. She has a black sleeping bag. We chat and I explain why I'm there, buried in the sand. She is very sympathetic. Now I'm in a blue sleeping bag. I ask her not to be so conspicuous when she is talking to me, because it makes it obvious I'm there. She apologizes and she asks how long I have to stay there. I say, "Until they give me my orders." She says, "Shall I tell you a story?" I say, "Sure. Which one?" She says, "How about the one, "Scary to touch"? It's children's campfire spook story. I say, "OK," and then wonder if that's a good idea. It might scare me and I'll be all alone soon when she's gone. (470 words)

I am combing my long hair, which is bleached blonde and dark together, maybe like growing out roots. I'd pull a loose hair and great strands would come out in my hand. I am appalled. I'll be bald soon at this rate. Then I look in the mirror. I see that when I lift up my blonde/dark hair that new growth is coming in and it's pure white. I am shocked and go into the next room to show Aunt Abigail and Dwight. I hold up the blonde/dark hair with my brush and say, "Look at this!" They look. Aunt Abigail exclaims, "It's all white." Dwight refuses to look and sings or chants nonsense words. I call Aunt Abigail "Elaine" and then realize my mistake and apologize to her. I am annoyed with Dwight. I tell him so. I say, "Hey, this is a traumatic moment here and you aren't being very responsive." He just chants louder. I am angry and then feel forgiveness. That's the best he can do. I don't need his approval (help), although it would be nice. I go out into another room and my father (at his age now, maybe even older) comes in and has a box. He says, "It took some doing to get it from the rich old guy, but I got it." He and I unpack it carefully. It's a shamrock vase. It's a special ceramic crock to mix the special "healing" potion in. It's upside down and we carefully put it right side up. I blow dust off it and have decided to wash it thoroughly before we start. If we're going to all this trouble, we might as well do it right. There's something about finding other stuff and Aunt Abigail. My father and I carry the vase to another room. I look toward a window. We are talking. He says, "We don't take the bus. We drive in each time we see the doctor. It's easier that way." I nod and notice a big "fatty tumor" on his ear and he has a fat lip. He looks old and a little ill. I feel a bit of concern.

A woman is the boss. She tells us what to do. We volunteer to help at a store. It's been a hard day and I'm starting to go home. I pass a beat-up car in the grass and think I've seen that image before. Why am I seeing it again? It must mean something. Maybe I dreamed it. Another woman and I walk past (I'm in my wheelchair) the candy section in the store. She pulls off a box and opens it. I remember we get things for free because we work there. I say, "Wait," and turn to look at the selections. I see the ice-cream section and wonder if there's any sugar-free ones. I see the cookie section. There's a machine. The boss woman put dough in it and huge, sticky rolls come out. They aren't quite done right, a bit doughy but still delicious. People are eating them. I try a bite, wondering if all that sugar will affect my irregular heart beat. The boss woman is crazy and goes off. I guess she dies. The other woman says to me, "At least I talked Sweet Liberty from walking." She felt proud of that. (Sweet liberty is a woman who is upset at the crazy boss woman and almost left.) I offer to help at the counter and the other woman says no, there's not much I can do, being disabled. All I could do would be the easy parts that everyone wants to do, like the cash register. I say, "Now don't be too hasty. Let's check it out. I might be more help to you than you think." [BL] (273 words)

I'm preparing for a math test. I'm not good at math and I tell people that. I have pages to study and I am trying to read them and quickly memorize as much as I can. It's time for the test. I go into a room off a living room. A brother is in the living room playing his radio loud. It distracts me. I am vaguely aware of a double screen window (see- through) where a woman is observing me. She hears me complain about the music and turns it off. I open the test packet and conscientiously try to answer without cheating. The woman or I am pleased, I'm doing the best I honestly can.

I am walking up a gravel road. I turn and look. The view is breathtaking, huge and beautiful. I am surrounded by mountains, rugged and covered with trees. A strong-colored sunset colors the entire scene of thick clouds and mountains in shades of purples, pinks and so on. The clouds cover the mountain peak. I think about going back to the hotel and getting my camera, but I know that I won't get a good picture; more the pity, because 1) the clouds obscure the peak, and 2) it would take too long and the beauty would be gone by the time I got back. So I stand there, looking intently all around. A huge, noisy jet plane is flying to the right. I can't see it because it's above the clouds, or rather in the clouds. It disturbs the beauty. I see a Bic lighter on the ground: litter. (150 words)

I am deeply in love with a priest (Gregory Peck). I cannot speak of my love to him because it is wrong. He loves me too. I go up to him (he's big and wearing ornamental robes). I lay my hands on his chest and say goodbye. I (I am Deborah Kerr) turn and walk away, feeling my grief intensely. Then I am standing under a tree. A man dressed in Robin hood-like clothes (ordinary clothes, not a priest's robe) comes under the tree with me. It is the man I love who has given up the priesthood. I stare at him, knowing on the unconscious level it is he. He moves tree branches like he's closing the curtains on a window for privacy. I wait, filled with love, wonderment and happiness and sadness. We are about to kiss. (139 words)

I am in a school room that's sort of out in the wilderness area near a river. I am helping the teacher. In fact, I'm a student teacher. I point up on the blackboard to some colored shapes and ask if any of the kids can show me the yellow squiggly ones. Mike (of 3rd Grade I taught) comes up and tries, but just doesn't understand. I then notice the children are leaving in the middle of the lesson. They are out and walking in the river. The teacher (other woman) comes in to critique my lesson. She asks me about my hair and wants to know if its length had always been the same. She asks questions about the color of it. I am impatient. I really want a critique of my work and she doesn't seem to be anywhere near that subject. Even things closely related to the lesson are not to the point. I feel frustrated. (159 words)

I am at a large church (Unitarian?). I am holding a small girl (8 or 9?). We are standing and hugging. It feels sweet and tender as we rock back and forth. The church service is over. As I am walking out, with the crowd, I see a man named "Bill" smiling at me from a pew across the room. He seems to like me. I smile back, a little uncertain. He tells me, as I'm passing him, that he'd been in the economics lab (or electronics lab) across from my classroom and had been admiring me from afar. He seems like a nice guy, bearded. I go on, because I'm walking and can't do that for long. Now we are outside and Mabel passes me. I say to her, I'm B, thinking she wouldn't recognize me standing up. She turns and smiles. Her son Matt comes up behind me. He picks me up and carries me for awhile. He seems very slim and I am concerned he'll tire or hurt himself. I lean back carefully (leaning over backwards?) to try and be comfortable without causing him discomfort. He puts me down and says his shoulders are starting to hurt. I rub his back with my hand in a patting gesture and say, "We don't want you to get hurt. That wouldn't do." We walk on. I look up and see we are walking up a very steep hill covered with ice. I feel concern that I'll slip and fall. Somehow I manage. I see a mountain and realize we've walked over the Cascades and are in Central (state). I say, "I like the air better over here. It's clearer." Then I ask Matt, as I'm getting tired, "Is this the way to my parents?" He says no. I say, "Then why am I doing this?" (using energy), and he says, "It's the way to God." We continue walking up the icy path. (323 words)

Both my mother and father have died. I am crying and very sad. I have to find a black outfit to wear. I want to wear all black. I can't find any. I frantically dig through my mother's closet and find a few possibilities. Then I look in another room. Behind a chest of drawers that is blocking the doorway, I see my suitcase. I rifle through it, spreading my papers far and wide as I grab for a black and gold striped blouse. I put it on. It's sort of see-through and I can see my bra. I see it's a maternity/nursing bra, partially opened, revealing part of my breast. I can't figure out how to close the snaps. I take off that blouse and continue my frantic search. I say to myself, sobbing, "I don't want to be late; please, God, don't let me be late." I feel I'll miss the ceremony. Gritting my teeth, I am determined to choose the next clothes item I find. It's a flower print blouse. I put it on and run for the car. I see the hearse with it's 14-21 seats is gone (I had seen it earlier each seat was separate from each other so the mourners could have privacy). I get in the back seat of a beige-colored convertible and it starts going as I'm still trying to button my blouse. I get out and try to steer it by leaning it this way or that. It's light and goes back and forth easily. (255 words)

I am on a date with this man. It's our first date. If we each pass the inspection test of the other, we may marry. He takes me to his apartment to show me (introduce me) to his things. It is important how I react to them. He has a huge warehouse-like room and furniture is in there like it was a store. I see ornate refurbished old-fashioned stoves (like I saw on TV) that cost 4 to 6 thousand dollars, lovely and well made (maybe 1920's style or earlier and some 1950's). There is lots of stuff. He looks at me, waiting and watching my reactions. I say, "May I look around?" He says, "Yes." This is all so serious. I look around and see a huge cupboard. I open it and see many loaves of bread, maybe 20 or more lined up on a bread board. I pull it out and look at the bread. I'm amazed there is so much. I make no comment. He is somewhat anxious, wondering how I'm feeling about all this. Do I feel accepting? Do I understand? I know now that he's the one and we will get married. I'm walking toward him to tell him so when a younger brother of his rushes in with the disturbing news that his mother is having an affair with Ethan. How inopportune. I must deal with this before I can marry this man. It is my duty to take the mother and Ethan aside and straighten them out (like a parent with teens). The man starts to go to the other room to wait this out, but I call him over and kiss him long and lovingly to let him know I've accepted him and everything is all right between us. He and I keep kissing because it's a wondrous feeling of connectedness, but we must part temporarily so I can take care of this interruption. He goes into another room. I follow the mother and Ethan into their living room. It is also huge and full of furniture, ritzy, very expensive stuff. I see Ethan seated, waiting to be chastised. The mother reminds me a bit of Thea. As I'm about to get the information, Ethan says, "I hope there won't be racial implications here." "What racial?" I ask, thinking he's stalling. I then remember he's Italian. "The Italian Stud" stereotype is what he's referring to. I hear a loud and annoying buzzing and realize it's my wheelchair battery recharger. I must plug it in. I say, "Wait a minute," and walk around with this long extension cord looking for a plug in. I finally find one tiny one on a wall and plug it in. The noise is so loud we have to shout. It's hard to hear. Ethan suggests we go to the other end of this huge room. I agree. As we are walking through the rich furnishings, I tell "Terence," a cousin or younger brother, to take the recharger out of the room and shut the double doors; maybe it will be quieter that way. He does. Ethan says something about Dwight. I say, "Who is Dwight?" He had meant his son and at first I thought he had meant my man. I now realize Ethan has had at least three wives. I find it amusing. I'll be related by marriage to Ethan. He'll be like a father-in-law. As we walk, the mother points out a coffee table made of giant clocks and says, "My watches, they are my watches." Ethan walks beside me, showing me snapshots that are very long for panoramic shots. He's showing me scenes from a production of his. I see a Venus de Milo type laying in an ocean. As he shows the snaps, a sort of story unfolds. A half human, half creature (sort of mermaid) is in the waters and comes near the shore to be able to kiss a pony who is on land. Meanwhile I see a naked Ethan with a hairy chest and back (like my father) in a huge vase/pot so he looks like a centaur. Now the snaps are of the pony lying on land at the water's edge and his inching along on his side trying to get into the water so they can kiss. (719 words)

I am playing my father's trumpet (no keys), no fingering holes; just use your lips, throat and wind to create notes. I do it very well and impress my parents. They go into a bedroom and make love (my parents). I am in a swimming pool. I go to a far corner in the shallow end and masturbate. It's not much fun or satisfying. I dive into the deep end of the swimming pool and go deep. I am concerned and struggle to the surface. I then go for the shallow end where I'll be safe. The bottom of the shallow end is sandy. A man/creature threatens me. I hit it and it falls unconscious to the bottom. Now I have to rescue it. It will drown like that. I pull it out. Andrea has a male client who is perverted in some way (perhaps sexual). She's being tested with lots of interruptions. She tries hard to be there for him. He even says it's OK to attend to the other things. A group of women come in. One woman (Rebecca?) says of the man, "Oh, I knew you when you were a boy." I see them standing in a circle holding a boy in the Sea of Galilee. They are helping him float. (214 words)

I'm driving a car or VW bus. I am alone. There is some kind of car trouble, and I say something like "Darn it!" A man suddenly sits up from the backseat. He has white powder on his face (like Amazon Warrior on TV or comedy thing where a guy gets hit in face with make up pillow). I am scared. Is he going to hurt me? He pulls out a knife and shows me the blade. He doesn't threaten me, just implies I'll get cut if I don't cooperate. I drive on. Now my car swerves. "Oh, no," I say, He asks what's wrong. "The tires are going bad" I say. "Slow down," he says. I pull over to the side of the road. He gets out. There's a man and a woman in the front seat with us now. The woman goes with the knife guy. He tells me to stay in the car and get some rest. I lay down in the back seat. Apparently I'd been up driving for hours and he needs me to be alert to drive. So I lay down, aware of this other blonde, crew-cut man still in front seat. He gets out and walks around the car to the open back seat at my feet. I'm in trouble and I know it. He crawls in and on top of me. Rape. I started yelling, "Help me. help me." He's trying to put his hand over my mouth. I struggle and bite. Two people who are sitting ahead of the car on the side of the road come towards us to help. The man gets off me and goes out into a cow field and starts shooting people at random. First he has a pistol and then a double-barreled 12 gauge shotgun. I am appalled. He's coming back to me to kill me. He shoots a woman in the belly. He aims the gun for me. People mill around. A man is seated in the back seat where I am. The killer comes to the back window and looks in. He has a flame thrower and is trying to light it. The man in the seat with me picks up a huge lighter and flames it and points it back at the killer's mouth. Somehow the killer swallowed a grenade or bullet in his attempt to load the flame thrower and so this flame, on the inside of the window glass, is supposed to heat him up so he'll explode. The flame catches around his mouth. A Native American woman like Theresa stands next to him and I violently motion to her to get away. I didn't want her killed in the explosion and I hoped the killer doesn't understand my gestures. He's taking a long time to explode and he gets his flame thrower pointed at me. Once I got out of car, but he came around and I got back in. The flames hit the inside of the elbow (crook of arm) and I feel burning pain. We are waiting and hoping he'll explode. (514 words)

I am put by some force in a house isolated by many miles on the beach. At first I don't want to enter, not knowing if I'm supposed to or not. Maybe someone lives there and I'm trespassing. Finally I go in, calling out, "Anybody home?" I live there alone. Now I'm going up a path that seems almost like a tunnel and it opens up to a huge beautiful lawn and a mansion. My neighbor is very rich. He's getting ready to go hunting. The dogs are huge and straining at the leash. I walk up and pet the dogs, looking unafraid of their potential power and danger. I do feel a tiny bit of concern but in general know these dogs like me. They like me so well, they refuse to obey their master's command to go hunt and hang around me to be petted. This actually pleases the master, who smiles approvingly. There are jealous ladies in the house. (162 words)

A man who is stupid (mr?) or behaves stupid, lives in a rich mansion. I am there and feel sure that somewhere in this man is intelligence. I am convinced that he'd been treated badly as a boy and that's why he behaves like he doesn't know anything. I look out a window and see a huge bay or backwater. A man is wading, looking for the spot where treasure is. He thinks he finds it in a corner near the land by the house. His pants are up to his thighs and the water up to his knees. He doesn't find the treasure. The water isn't as deep as I thought it would be. Instead he swoops down and picks up a pair of thick black-framed sunglasses with rhinestones on the side pieces. He goes off with it. I yell out, "Hey, don't you take that; it's mine." He runs off. I go back in the house, concerned and intrigued by the man. The key word to his problems is, "boy." I see his father, an older, balding man, and speak with him. I confront him and say it was his bad treatment that made the man stupid. The father is arrogant and emotionally flippant. I tell him I want to investigate the man/boy's past. He agrees and seems quite willing in a negligent way to supply all the stored things remaining of the past. He brings me, one box at a time, three boxes, big flat ones. I open them and find a leather cowboy chaps/pants the boy wore. I find a yellow heavy plastic playsuit. It's cute and in excellent condition. I find some grade reports, a teacher's note in the 1st grade music book. I can pinpoint the problem to the 1st or 2nd grade, but nothing conclusive. I begin to suspect the father knows that and that's why he's cooperating. I go to visit his teacher. She says the boy always had problems. (328 words)

I am in a village, a beginning of someday larger city. It's tents and open canvas over tables. I have a store where I sell things. It's sort of primitive like an Alaskan camp in the old days. Someone (maybe Aunt Elaine) says, "Let's go down to the house and get what we can." It's a damaged house, maybe winds or fire, and we'll collect what is salvageable. It's an outing. It will be fun. I go get my wallet and pick out little white ceramics of animals. It's a collection, horses standing up rearing and other animals. They were in my change purse in my wallet. There's something about a small bottle of milk. I drink some. (The bottle is like a small apple juice bottle.) Then I try to rinse it out by submerging it in water, either a sink or a toilet. The milk emerges with the water. My mother is there somewhere. Now I'm on a sailboat, and the sail isn't unfurled. Another woman and I (Joni Woodward, in Rachael movie) are on the boat and it's getting dark. We push the boat into a side backwater area because the winds will be high at night; we'll be safe in this little harbor. The woman lies down and I am aware that we are free to spend the night together. There is a feeling of sensuality and forbidden fun. Another woman lies down and I hesitantly join them. Somehow if it were just two, it would be sexual and wrong, but three will be OK, sensual and fun and temporary. There's another sailboat out there, with men on it, two strong virile men. They don't come in for safe harbor, and it's sexual and not OK. (290 words)

A man, sort of like Doug, has bet $2,000 he can find the golden key. He cannot afford to lose this bet. Someone places the key near the left front wheel of my chair. I get up and stand nearby watching. He looks all around and isn't finding the key. I try to give him hints. I clear my throat and look at the key significantly. No dice. I start talking about my chair very loudly, and about my left front wheel, but he just doesn't get it. I feel sorry for him. It will matter to him to lose all that money. He can ill afford to lose, but he can't seem to find what's right out there in the open, even when hinted at with clues. (128 words)

I go into a classroom. I haven't been there in a long time. I sit down in my seat. I have Rover, a white cat and a rat. They take their place beside me on the left, and curl up for a nap. They are well behaved, which I'm grateful for and a little surprised. I thought they'd have forgotten, it's been so long. Now I'm the teacher and giving the lesson. As I'm merrily teaching, enjoying it, I am told by several people to cool out. The students are ready to do their own lessons now and, in fact, need the practice. It is best for me to step aside now and let the natural order of things go on. I don't want to stop, but realize it is best, and I go sit back in my seat. Rover is acting up and running around.

There is a grand piano. A man (graduate student) is about to give a demonstration of his work. He calls out the title, "59 Flamenco Dancers" and is about to start playing, when he pauses to listen. He hears someone else playing, a ghost pianist. I listen. No, that's just the typist (I hear fast typing). Then I hear fast piano music (like Flight of the Bumblebee). I now agree, it's the ghost pianist. Now the piano position is changed and there are two of them. They are positioned closer to a stage area for performance. There are some things on a shelf on the piano - big gulp plastic cups and other things. They start to shake and move. The ghost shows us his presence. Then the ghost picks me in my wheelchair up and we fly around the room fast. I'm not afraid, but excited like on a carnival ride. (152 words)

I am watching a production of one of my plays. I see the audience (a classroom) is restless and I realize they do not like my play. It is long and confusing and boring. There is no action. At the end, I say, "I want feedback. It is important so I can improve. I know you don't like it, but tell me why." I feel pain and embarrassment and some pride, but I have the courage to face this. They tell me the first part is boring because it just goes through a history of self. The second part is more interesting because there is relationship and activity (action). I agree. Now I look for a bathroom and find a public one. I look over the stall doors to find one that's empty. I find one where the toilet is sideways. I go in and use it. As I go out, I remember I left my Bic cigarette lighter (green). I think of Andrea and how she's getting critiqued. I go back in and look for the lighter and find it. (181 words)

I'm looking for the sugar-free candies. I ask the owner (male, older). He isn't sure, so I poke around. I go to the end where two piles of candy are. One pile has a wrapping; looks like a miniature package of baloney. I'm trying to read the ingredients and can't really see the words. I lean on the counter, my butt sticking out. The owner says, "Look, that man is here and he's with your wife." I look up and see a woman with dark hair and am more interested in seeing the ingredients of this candy. I pay no more attention to the couple. He's stealing her and she's a slut, so who cares. (115 words)

I am dressed as a man, 1800's, a cowboy hat and a business suit. I'm driving a wagon and come to a town owned by a greedy man. He charges too much for everything. So I decide to stay outside the city limits in my own wagon and be self-sufficient. I ask where the line is and go beyond it. I sleep in the wagon and have food. Another man follows me and watches. He knows I'm female (or suspects it) and seems protectively interested in me. He's leaning against a door jamb and I am also, looking up at the profile of his face, searchingly.

Later I talk to Ding and tell her I'm working hard on my issues as a full-time counselor, and then I amend that and say I haven't seen her for weeks. Actually I'm thoroughly searching my dreams for the answers, who, what, when, why. I'll find out what happened. She's not terribly interested. (72 words)

I am in a room. Outside the room are empty jail cells and school rooms. No one else is there. I am aware someone is trying to kill me. The door opens and a white pail with a thin creamy white liquid is put in the room. I realize it's an explosive and I run, grab a broom and sweep it out of the room. I slam the door, but the broom with some of the liquid on it gets back in the room, by the door. I go to the center of the room and wait. It all explodes. I am unhurt. Now a man is in the room with me and he says intently, "I'm hungry." He looks at a bowl of mush and I look and it's covered with mold (big mixing bowl). I grab it and run for the sink and turn on the faucet to wash it down the drain before he tries to eat it and get sick. I also have a banana I'd brought in from my lunch and it swells up with water. I'm going to give it to the man because I know it's not poisoned because it came with me, but then I realize I'd best protect myself and eat it or I'd have no food. I squeeze or "milk" the water out (also a white liquid); it gets skinny and flaccid. I take a bite out of it (or break off a piece and eat it). I remain on the alert because there's other ways I could get killed here. The man says, "Oh I didn't realize they wanted us to marry/have sex." He goes on to explain how he isn't very careful and doesn't let the rubbers warm up properly. He's following me around and I say to him, "Please stop talking like this. I'm scared; people are trying to kill me and this isn't helping." (318 words)

I'm in my wheelchair and am getting some tickets in a packet handed to me. "What's this?" I ask, surprised. "They've changed how they do this," says the man. "Now you get three tickets, you can use them for three events, or two events with one more person." I point to a notice of prizes and ask if I get those too. He's annoyed with me for not understanding because he's already explained. I am confused and he goes through the three tickets routine again, and because things are changed, we don't get the free prizes anymore. "OK," I say, and go to a house (a huge house with lots of rooms). I want to change my clothes for this new event. I'm told by my helpers (Cindy L. of MIUSA) and Merle that we're to wear a special costume. That's what these special spiritual (psychological) helpers do at this kind of meeting. I guess we're sort of like student associates and anyone who is disabled is automatically allowed in free. I'm annoyed by that. I look through my closet, which is large and filled. I can't find what I want and go to another room where several closets are also filled. I comment that later I will go through and clean out the closets and get rid of old ones I never wear. I get my outfit together - a red velvet tunic, my Robin Hood hat (red velvet), and tights. I borrow boots from Cindy. I'm ready to go to the meeting (maybe one of the freebie prizes was a small box of colored pencils and crayons). (269 words)

A male dog and I are watching a female dog as she gives birth to a litter of puppies. I wonder if this seems strange and incomprehensible to the male dog. I see a small face of a puppy just inside the swollen vulva of the dog and then five puppies are born. They lay in little heaps in the dirt and I watch the female dog go to each one, sniff, lick and place her tongue under the tongue of each one. I watch the eyes of one that doesn't seem to be responding and as she places her tongue under it, its eyes come to life and I know its all right. Now we're going to a town. The puppies, the mama dog and I are on the roof of a school bus that the male dog is driving. We have to go to a hostile town to save the children. I'm writing notes on yellow lined paper and addressing cards. As we pull into town, we know we are in danger from the adults. They will "hound" us and try to prevent us from getting our messages to the children. As we drive into town, the female dog goes into the bus and I hand down the puppies one at a time to alternating sides, first to the waiting male paw on the left, then to the waiting female paw on the right. I stay up there and throw the messages out to mailboxes, hoping the kids get them before the adults. Now we have to run for it. We drive fast (I get inside) and we are following a tightly curved road around and find a huge body of water. Our road narrows until it disappears, but we keep going anyway, maybe even directly on the water. We get away. (304 words)

I am in front of the Bon Marche store and suddenly women quickly gather and rush in. I go in and ask what's going on. It's a big sale. So I go around looking at things. I see a harmonica, different than a blues harp, and I try it. I can easily play music, and check the price. It's on sale for $42.00, marked down from $55.00. That's a lot of money, but it's so easy to play. I buy it. Now I'm walking upstairs and wondering if there's an elevator and if I'll make it far without my wheelchair. On the 2nd floor it's rough going. A circular cloth covers the whole area and the only place to walk is at the edge where the cloth snaps into the wall. I hang on and nearly slip and fall, but manage to make it. Now I'm outside and see Mary Allgier. I show her my harp and explain it won't bend notes but I still have my blues harp to do that. Then I do some blues riffs saying words like "train, chuga chuga" into the harp. and blowing train whistle notes. I'm impressed and so is Mary [more about talking with a man]. (199 words)

I'm staying overnight in a house. There is a dispute going on between the female neighbor and the male owner. They are hassling each other and I'm caught in the middle. For example, he calls on the phone and let's it ring repeatedly. This interrupts my attempts to sleep. I get up and the woman comes in with ducks and geese and let's them wander all over the house. I know they will poop all over. I say, "I'd like you to leave now," and she pretends she's forgotten the geese and ducks and says she'll be back Tuesday morning. I ask her to take the fowl home now. I don't want to be the accidental victim of their "war" and try not to get drawn into it. It's hard not to. (132 words)

He's leaving on tour in a few moments, so I know I'm safe. He leans me into the back wall of a station wagon (we're standing outside). Then he pauses, closes the back hatch and walks us to the front of the car because we might get tempted by the bed in the back of the car. I like his kisses and regret when he has to leave. I get in my car and wave goodbye as he leaves in his car. I hand him my name and address. (122 words)

A man and a woman want to make love and are looking for a place where they can be private. A man hides in closets and the woman goes from closet to closet looking for him. She sees a boy coming to the closet to hang up his hats. This bothers her because he'll find their closet and interrupt. He goes in and is now in his own room. Three puppets are hung up on the hat rack. He's afraid of one of them because it has huge black circles for eyes and looks scary. He calls to his daddy who says there's nothing to worry about. Then the two male puppets are moving and talking. One turns to the other and wants to make love, so the other one becomes a "female" and they have sex. I feel orgasm. A voice says, "That's OK, they are doing this because they are not really homosexual, they are both" (meaning bi-sexual). [BL] (160 words)

I am trying to park my car and some man has his car in my space and has a baby in a box or carriage. I pull up next to him and it's a tight fit because a third car is to my right. I tell him not to worry, I'll be careful, and that I have a right to park here. I get out and walk across the parking lot to my apartment. It's in a "hall" or row of apartments. The first and second one looks nice, and each one after that looks progressively more old and broken down. I live in the first one. I have to walk up four or five steps and it's hard to do. I wonder why it's not accessible. I go in and drop a tape cassette on the floor and then need to find it. I search and search and find lots of other junk. It's a big mess and it's all my roommates stuff. She's very sloppy. I then walk through the rooms - the kids' bedroom and the kitchen. The kitchen is huge and there are four tables (two are hers) and covered with leftover breakfast stuff. I think, "Why am I putting up with this?" and then wonder how I'd manage with her gone - all that room in the kitchen. But I do decide to ask her to move. She and her boyfriend are angry and come after me. I run outside and see the nice man I parked next to. I go behind him and he readily jumps into the fray and runs the two meanies away. I thank him and apologize for using him as a shield. It was MY fight, after all. He is fine about it and was happy to help. I then go visit Ginny and Ernie who are busy. They'd been selling their things at a very cheap price. They are telling me how awful it feels to sell nice things they paid good money for, for just a few dollars. I ask Ginny why they're doing that. It doesn't make much sense. Are they in financial difficulties? I look at Ginny and see Ernie seated in a high chair (baby's) and am surprised. I didn't see them switch sides and am not used to Ernie in that position! I want them to meet my new roommate. We walk across the street to my place. Again, I am aware of having a hard time walking up the stairs. I open the door and the living room is well picked up and very neat. The nice man and lots of his children are there. It's like a pre-school room - some watching TV, some napping on the couch. He points to a box and I ask, "What's it's name?" ( a baby that on closer inspection is a stuffed animal that's alive). He's green and cuddly and his name is Elmer. I pet him and exclaim, "He's purring." I think he's cute. There's a sense of comfort with my new roommate situation. (510 words)

I am holding Charla, who is overweight like Mateo. I feel upset that Ellie permits this to happen. Ellie comes in and I struggle with my need to help Charla and a wish not to hurt Ellie (or not to be yelled at by Ellie when she gets defensive). I choose to be honest with my feelings and say, "I know you don't want to hear this and that I promised I wouldn't, but I have to tell you this for Charla's sake." I go on quickly. I am eloquent and empathetic (I think) and she hates hearing it, but bears up well, not yelling or interrupting, but shuddering and bowing her head sometimes. I tell her she is presenting a role model for Charla that teaches her all the wrong things. I point to the mess in Charla's room where she's shredded paper and torn up her toys and I say, "I know you think she's destructive, but look what's she's learned from." We walk through the rooms and I point out mess after mess. "And here, I know, is my mess. But, be honest, if it weren't there, yours would be." Then I'm in bed. Someone comes into the room and I struggle to open my eyes. I wonder if it is Aunt Millie who I had seen outside napping on an ambulance stretcher. I pull up my sunglasses and see Ellie laying down across my body. She says, "Hold me, Mama" in a baby-like, heart-breaking tone. (249 words)

Paulina seems remote and not emotionally connected. Then her older sister (maybe Ellie) cries and asks Paulina to forgive her for setting her up to be so remote. They hug and Paulina is now emotionally freer. She and I hug warmly. Now she wants me to come to her home in another state. I say, oh, I'd rather not. I don't like the mountains, the high altitude," but I relent and say, "B ut if you're going to insist and live there, I'll have to breakdown and learn to live with rarified air." Now we're in her car, she's driving and we're going over the mountains. She shows me huge mountains and snow slopes. We marvel that even on the hottest day of summer, there is still snow. Then it starts snowing and Paulina is concerned. The driving is going to be dangerous and slick so she prepares to be alert. She says to me, "Don't make any of your silly noises, ok?" She's asking me not to suddenly do any of my comedic stuff that might startle her and break her concentration. She's being polite. I assure her I'll be good. I tell her to relax. I trust she'll do well. We drive through the falling snow and suddenly it's all gone and the summer day is beautiful. I am so taken by the beauty, I ask Paulina to pull up so I can take pictures. She pulls up, turns the car around and I get out with my camera. The large purple flowers are wonderful and I try to use my close-up lens, but somehow what I see alludes the auto focus camera eye and only "ordinary" stuff gets focused. I'm disappointed and look around for a better subject and am very drawn to the beauty of the moment - the mountains, the flowers and a huge wide river that I realize is actually the highway we are driving on.

I am flying a plane, or I am flying, not sure which. A man loves me and is supportive. Another man is trying to win the race with me and is quite willing to kill me, if need be, to be the victor. It's neck and neck, we are evenly matched. I am barely ahead of him. He tries to crash into me and I go straight up to override him. I come to the ceiling (with fire protection sprinklers on it). He climbs up and tries to shoot me. I duck and dive and twist all around and then am the winner. He crashes. I go into a building where my supportive male friend waits. Now there's some kind of difficulty affecting the land. I must live in this one room place and wait. I then go to a grocery store, hoping I'm not too late and all the food I need or want is already gone. I do find what I need - milk, eggs, butter, meat for meatloaf. I go back to my room. The prince (my supportive male) is there. The grocery store man becomes the queen of the land. There is some question if another will usurp my prince's rightful place. Now we're at a reception and everyone dotes on us, giving expensive gifts. The leering, fat man touches the cleavage of my breasts and I say, "Stop that." My prince gets possessive and says, "Stop that." The fat man just grins and winks. (249 words)

Ginny gives me a present, her old weights which are flat and rectangular. We are amiably chatting as she gives them to me, and I put one on my feet and try to do a leg lift. The feet, because they are crooked, move and I keep dropping the weights. I keep trying, aware that I am overdue for the exercise. Then she goes to fix lunch and I step into the bathroom to pee. As I pull down my pants, I notice the toilet bowl is starting to overflow slowly. I decide to pee anyway. As I am peeing, Ernie opens the door. He has to go pee and is waiting his turn. His pants are down around his knees. He stands out there telling me about this experience he had at work. I'm a little amazed he'd be that open and casual with me and I'm a little embarrassed to be caught peeing into an overflowing toilet, but we chat like nothing unusual is happening. He says he made a mistake in his PR presentation which he presented on the other company's film machine which had a mistake in it. I sympathized, "Just like being caught in a do loop," I say. He agrees. I get done and get up and he goes over to pee. I apologize for the messy overflow and he accepts it fine. I go into the bedroom. Ginny is calling to us to hurry and join her for lunch. I look at myself in the mirror and see my new weights are now a red bra I wear over my regular one and it's seen through my blouse, which is white and a bit crumpled. Ernie and I seem to be wearing a similar outfit. White shirt/blouse, beige slacks. I try to tidy up my appearance, but feel a little inadequate and embarrassed. (310 words)

The sink is filled to overflowing. I rinse my thumb and continue to wipe my butt, which has streaks of it. Suddenly Mary yells, "The Clinic," and gets up and runs so fast out of the bathroom that she doesn't even bother to open the door, she goes through the door, like she's a spirit or melts through it. I comment on that to Nancy, it is so amazing. Mary comes back very upset because she was right. She just missed her clinic appointment and it was so important. She's leaving for Mexico and wanted to know what to do if she got raped and they used knives to cut the inside of her vagina.

A fat statue of a goddess says to me, "Would you please take my place for awhile? I've got some stuff to do." I hesitate, because I don't know if it will be unpleasant or hurt or not. Then I do. She goes off and I stand in her place. Later, I go outside and am still looking for the camera. I go home, driving my van. I go in and a man from a publishing house is waiting for me with good news. He wants to publish my book. I ignore him, looking for the mail. I see two rejection letters there. I decide to go downstairs and take a swim. I go down a long flight of white stairs where the walls are up high. I keep trying to make the walls into windows, but no dice. I get to my basement and see a huge swim pool. I know some men are waiting to go swim, but I take all my clothes off and dive in; they will just have to wait. I swim well and it's very sensual and wonderful. Everyone waits for me. (214 words)

I am visiting a family. I like the father. I have a room of my own. Others share rooms. I go into the bathroom and pee on the floor next to the toilet. It keeps coming out and a huge puddle builds. Then I see a bedpan thing and sit on it to have a bowel movement. Then I rinse it into the toilet and use lots of paper towels to clean up the urine on the floor. A lot of unnecessary work! Now I go out to see the family. Lots of Mexican relatives come by to visit. I am a guest of honor. One man is dressed up in drag. I tease him about his "lovely" makeup and wig. The father gives me copies of all the snapshots we'd taken with the family. I move in some of them. One, I run up to join everyone and my skirts are too high and I pull them down and then I'm out of focus. Another one I'm in a group in the back, seated in my wheelchair. The photos are all on a huge piece of paper with dotted lines all around them, so you can undo them and separate them. There is also a box of papers and things. I peek in and decide to deal with it later. The father stands beside me and we put our arms around each other's waist as we stand side by side. I feel unsure if this is a proper thing to do. We release and go on. I see a baby boy playing in the tank top of the toilet and I am concerned he can't breathe. I go look and see he's all tangled up in the wires. I grab his feet and try to pull him out. I know I'm hurting him. (304 words)

I'm making love to Howard. It is pleasant. Then he turns and presents his butt so I can lick his penis. I'm not thrilled, but everything else is so pleasant, I guess I can accommodate him. Then I say, "Wait, I hear Mom." I look and see that the bedroom door is opened. I get up and close it. I see the M City house stairs. The door is the same as my parents' M City house bedroom door. My mother is going up and down the stairs, carrying laundry. She's cleaning house. I get back in bed with Howard, but the mood is broken. His penis is flaccid. We agree to wait until later. There is a feeling of disappointment coupled with anticipation of later. (126 words)

I am seated at the very back of a huge theatre area, with steeply raked stairs. A woman sits behind me. Two ugly, big men in business suits sit next to me, crowding me. I hear my name being called from the stage and I get up and try to run down all those stairs; apparently I'm getting some kind of award. I get there and I'm given a prosthesis leg for my right leg and then I am challenged to get into a huge diesel truck and drive around the audience. I get in, not sure if I can do this. I struggle and get the hang of it and drive well up those stairs, around and through the audience and back down. I choose to return to the stage via a path that is barely underwater. The audience is impressed with my daring and skill. I am back on stage. They tell me I have to drive the truck again and I say no, I don't want to. Then they say, "Give us back the prosthetic leg." Then there is more, about a woman who has her exhusband still around and a new man is moving in. (199 words)

I am in a bathtub and Ellie is shampooing my hair. She puts on too much shampoo and as I lay back in the water, I can't get it all rinsed out. Ellie is in a hurry and I insist I try and rinse more off by putting my head under the shower! The water is cool and not very much of it. I check my body temp and its only 90 degrees, a sub temperature. I feel cold and not very much energy. (84 words)

I'm in a space ship flying a helicopter inside the halls, which is dangerous but necessary because if we can't open a door to get out, the whole thing will explode. We'll use the helicopter to smash the door open. Several of us open a window and that is necessary so the explosion won't harm us. As I look down, I say, "Why don't we just jump out and run?" Someone says, "We might break a leg, it's so far down." I say, "We could make it." No one responds, so I shrug and assume people think it's too risky. We go back and force the door open and run, waiting for the explosion. I notice I stand close to the ship and hope I don't get hurt with the flying glass. (132 words)

I'm walking down a hall, going to a meeting. The meeting is in a room where students lounge. It's crowded and noisy, so we decide to move to a meeting room at the men's PE building. I get up and start walking there. I'm wearing my Katrina birthday outfit. I see 25 dollar bills clinging to my skirt. I pick them up and see money lying on the floor and pick that up. It might be $80.00. I can't tell and I decide to keep it, even though I feel dishonest and worry that the student who lost it will need it and will be miserable about it. I see Mateo who is still 8 or 9 or 12 years old, but he's taller than I am and I think about kissing him like I would a man, but feel guilty and dishonest so I don't. He wants me to visit his classroom. I'm in a hurry, but agree and follow him. He sits and I sit in a back row and wave to him. I listen for a minute as his student teacher is unorganized and then I signal to him that I have to go. I see how fat he is and feel sorry for him. I walk down the halls and see a young woman, disabled, seated on the floor with her dig in harness. She says, "Hi, you and Sebastian were great." (We played in a band together.) I say, "Sebastian's my cousin." She says, "I know." She knows Bonnie also. Then she tries to pick up her dog and says annoyed, "He always thinks I'm going to pet him when I do this." I go on. I find the men's PE room which is under the stage. Jerome says, "You guys aren't going to throw us out, are you? This is a meeting about student success." I sit on a couch and take a moment to look at the money I found. It's 500 dollars, but it's in traveler's checks made out to Morris _____ from British Columbia. I realize with relief I can't keep it and I'm now concerned about how to get to the lost and found office to return it before it closes at 5:00. Our meeting will last until 5:00 and the student will be very worried. (386 words)

I live on the tip of a peninsula in a tropical climate. A man has been killed or injured (a king?) and he is searching out the man who did it. He chases him around and gets him cornered as he leaps in a river exhausted. The man says, "I'm going to take a river foot," meaning he will slice the tendons of his heal or will chop off his foot. The chased man nods tiredly. Anything is better than being on the constant run. He then lays his head under the water prepared to endure the pain. Someone grabs his foot up and holds it for the knife and I wonder if the man can hold his breath that long. It's going to be bloody and hurt, but the relief of being able to stop running will be worth it. (141 words)

I'm going to attend a school and must climb up the elaborate series of ladders to get to the classroom. I have a small girl with me. She is fearful of climbing and worried she will get lost. I say, "Here, I'll help you." First we go up four rungs, then step over to another ladder and go down a few rungs, then step over to another ladder and go up. We get quite high and I become very afraid that I will fall. I stop and am unable to continue on up. I ask for help. If someone would take the little girl and get her up to safety, maybe I can make it. Another woman is with me. A man comes from above and helps the girl. Then I make it up the rest of the way. Now we are told that that was just a test and we passed the classes, are not really up here and we won't have to do that climb again. So we get into an elevator and it starts going down very fast. I notice there are no control buttons. It's taking a long time. I am amazed. It's like we were going very deep, maybe to the center of the earth. Finally we arrive. It's a large hall with open classrooms off it. I pass several areas where mostly women students are doing things. I see a lecture going on where the students are manipulating things like in a lab. I see an ornate TV set and am amazed because back in this time there are no TV sets and I say, "Look, this is a man in a box," like I'd never seen TV before. Then we go to a sort of bar-like area and I go to the bar to register for my classes. Then I go outside where a swimming pool has been cleverly made out of Satellite parts. A man is searching the plants and a finds a space mold on one and he is very concerned. We are in a class system and this means something is not balanced and working right and will get worse if we don't correct the situation. He can't seem to get anyone else to be concerned and he sort of becomes an underground spy to try to correct the problem himself. I chase to help him. He and I are simpatico. Now I'm in a room and I have two Spanish-speaking roommates and it's time to get up and get dressed and go to school. I have some trouble choosing my clothes. Now I'm in a large spacious hall and a man is obsessed with love for a woman. But she won't return his love and feels pursued. He feels cold, calculating and intense. Very matter of factly, she keeps slipping away from him. Now I'm laying down sleeping and I am aware of a person standing next to me and I feel the crooked right forefinger of my mother gently touching my face. It feels very nice and sweet and I hope it's my mother and not this man. I wake up and I see "Ginny" and the man comes up to her. He's seated on a large thing and he would pick up her hand and place it on his head so she could caress her hair and she would remove it and he would put it back and so on. It is annoying and intense. I decide to help her and I sign up to her to turn and go down the stairs. She runs fast and I watch as the man, angry, runs after her. She turns suddenly and runs up another set of stairs. He comes up where I'm still standing. I signal her to go down the hall and get into a room quick. The man, at first fooled, comes up the stairs and I watch him and point in another direction. I hear a woman's voice down the hall and think it is Ginny and am concerned he will hear, but I look and it's some other woman talking on the show. He is fooled and goes the other way. (697 words)

I am in a crowd of people. We are mixing, hoping to find a love. I see Riker of Star Trek and like him. He seems attracted to me. Now it's time to play a softball game and I'm telling who is on what bases, and all the players are ready except for first base (who is on first). It is supposed to be Riker and I look up at the second story windows and yell "Riker! you are on." He comes sleepily to the window; he'd been napping. He comes down. Now Troi and I are in bed together cuddling. I am aware of her lovely naked body and as we adjust or position, my hand accidentally brushes past the nipple of one breast. I feel a little tense but assure myself this is not sexual, merely sensual and, in fact, that is so. We are talking about it being time for me to change, because if I don't, it won't be possible to leave the planet and go with Riker. In order to help me, Troi calls in Ellie who had prepared a series of rocks (a gate, etc.) tied up by a string. I say, "You really want to get it of me, don't you?" semi-teasing. She says seriously, "No, but l want... (something like you to be happy)." Troi and I then exchange bodies so I can experience what it is like to be free of my own patterns of thought and feeling I've built up since birth, and to experience her way of feeling her own feelings. It's a delightful experience. Then I see her push a table over and hit her ankle and limp with pain. I go and kneel in front of her and try to be sympathetic. "Does it hurt?" I ask. She grimaces and says, "I'm fine." (306 words)

My mother comes up behind me and slaps me on the butt. It really hurts and I say, "Mom! that really hurt." She snaps, "Don't be silly." And I follow her and say, "I mean it, you really hurt me sometimes." And she says, "It's just your arthritis; it makes you sensitive." And I say, "No, even when I was a child, you would hurt me lots of times." She is angry at me. I turn and walk into the kitchen and I look for a drawing of Ellie holding Charla (a profile like my lake Michigan picture of holding Ellie). My mother had drawn the picture. It's very sweet and cute. She accidentally drew another picture on the same paper right under it. I wanted to make a Xerox copy of it. I see two half smashed like butts on the sink of dirty dishwater and I reach to put them out, because they are my mother's and this is a silly, childish revenge. She sees me and says, "Oh, no you don't." I try to snub them out, but she hits me on the butt. I cry, "Oow! Don't." And I try to hit her back. I scratch at her chest and try to hit her arm. Finally I grab the front and side of her dress and start swinging her back and forth to smash her up against the counters that are at a 90 degree angle. I smash her to the left and back to the right. I'm screaming "Oooh," like a siren up and down and she is trying to get at me to stop me. (271 words)

Ginny and I and my three girls and their two boys are walking. We had just left a classroom where I'd looked out the window and saw the two boys sleeping outside in the rain in sleeping bags. They had started the night in the back yard and had moved to the front because some lights were shining through the front window, so they lay right where the light fell. Anyway, we are walking and I'm in front and we step up two steps only. Ginny trips and falls. I stop and help her up. She is very upset and says, "The baby. Take over and help me." I realize she is three months pregnant and is worried about a miscarriage. I then try to get her over to a place to lie down and am also telling the kids where they need to go and to behave. I leave the kids and take Ginny over to a bed and have her lie down. It's a "hospital," but it sure doesn't look like it. A woman nurse comes up, only dressed in regular clothes. I explain. She and several other nurses go to Ginny to "touch the lover," to feel the extended belly of the pregnant woman, but all they see is a concave, empty, flat belly since the fetus is only a small little bump. They are repulsed and a little afraid. I must leave Ginny there to go get the kids. I look for them and find them. I call them over but they won't listen. I am frustrated, especially with the two boys. I keep trying, but they are stubborn and angry. I realize it's a power struggle, so I blurt out, "Your mother is in the hospital and needs you to be there," to try and reach them. They still do not respond. I don't know what else to do, so I walk away hoping that by not forcing power, they will be forced to come. It helps some. (333 words)

I pick up one, a girl in a pink dress and in a manual chair. She is sort of alive. I put her back. I look at a picture of their choir director, a man with a motorcycle and brace on one leg and an amputated stump on the other. I go on looking at other things in the store. [BL] (99 words)

I am in a closet. There are lots of old clothes on the rack. Small rodents live there too (rabbits or rats). I am seated and Ellie is at my right. I'm looking out through the doors to a show Rochelle is doing. She is old and wrinkled and walking. She is doing a comedy act. I say to Ellie, "Look how old Rochelle looks." I am shocked. To my left are two faucets that don't work properly. The water comes out like a shower head, only some of the small streams of water are cut off. A plump, hippie type man sits next to the faucet, facing me at a perpendicular angle. He can fix the faucet. Now Ellie is between me and the faucets and she is telling me she got a terminally affection psychosis. Her face changes to a baby face looking expectant for affection. The face keeps changing back and forth from baby to her. I pat the cheek of the baby face and say, "Sweet baby." I try to give it some of the affection it craves (is hungry for). I feel tired and unable to give it the quantities it needs. I feel more and more tired myself till I am nearly comatose. A small baby girl (1 year) comes to me. I scoop her up in my arms and kiss her. She says, "I don't want to be kissed." I say, "Good for you to say so. I should have asked first." Then she gives me a kiss. I love her very much. I am walking, holding her and an adolescent boy comes in front of us and sits with his leg on a hard cover book (Hamlet's Mill?). I yell at him, "Get your leg off that!" He looks upset at my ferocious rudeness and looks to his father for direction. He then gets up and goes away. I say roughly, "It's OK. You can stay. I really wanted the other side anyway." I go to a similar setup across from where he was and sit to play intently with the baby. I am lying on a shelf on a ledge. I'm tired. Another woman picks up my original lecture papers and a handout. I ask her to give them back. She refuses. There is a power struggle. I choose not to fight. She takes the papers and goes down the ladder. I feel like I gave up and then lost. I am angry. (412 words)

My mother is fixing a huge special breakfast: eggs, pancakes, bacon, sweet rolls. I look forward to it and pick up the sweet rolls and put them in a pan on the burner to cook through. My mother speaks to me and I can't understand her for several tries. Finally I smile and say, "OK, I'll get it, I should not have put the rolls on so soon." I try to pick them up and they come apart. It's a mess. I am aware that I'm handling this situation differently than I usually do. I am more open and willing to admit a mistake and willing to try and fix it, rather than get all stubborn in my anger and shut down or snap back. [BL] (125 words)

I'm a high flying trapeze artist in a circus. My partner is a good-looking dark man, perhaps wearing black and a cape. I am afraid of heights, but I am in this act. The dark man is going to set up an accident for Burt Lancaster so he'll be killed. I could be hurt too. Two older police detectives are up there on the trapezes to fight out what's going to happen and save us. They are overweight, pot-bellied, and fumble. One man nearly falls because he couldn't grasp the trapeze. His timing was off, but somehow he manages. They figure out that the dark man has cut the circular ring holding the rigging. They pull it down before Burt gets up there and say, "You are under arrest," to the dark man, who escapes and grabs a mentally retarded girl as his cover. The crowd gasps in horror. I realize I must save her by going in her place. I don't want to, but must and then somehow that bit of the dream is replayed and he is arrested before he can take the girl hostage and he is taken off. Now I hug Burt and it feels so warm and safe. I realize he can't say, "I love you" back, but it's OK. He now is teaching me an act that doesn't involve high flying. He has some little figures on a table and he calls out which one I pick up in my left hand. I pick it up, a figure of an older woman, and its jelly like outer cover comes off in my hand. I try to put it back on because that spoils the trick, but I've messed it up and it's not quite the same. I feel loved. This new act is so safe and pedestrian, but I am glad I don't have to be up there any more. Now Burt is going to fly again and I see him. The dark man had tricked him. Burt was walking into the arena and a group of people seated at a ringside table had their feet way. So he chose to go up a different pole than he usually does. (This was set up by the dark man.) Burt and I are seated ringside watching this as though I am reading an article in a film magazine about it and the pictures are like a movie we're watching Burt in a sexual turn-on to me. I feel alive with sexual desire and he turns and smiles and says, "Being in tights is not a good time to get an erection. We laugh and sit there together knowing that later we will make love. Meanwhile, we see "Burt" go up the wrong or tampered-with pole. It snaps in half and he is smashed as he flies into the broken bottom half, which looks like a huge penis. He is crucified on it and his pain and humiliation is strong. I feel sad for him. Now his friend, another male flyer with a deformed small left arm (like Merle), is going up. I am amazed at how he can do that easily, one-armed. I look for the "continued story" on another page and after leafing through the magazine, I realize the story will be continued in the next monthly issue, April/May, 1991. The words "Break" in white letters on black background indicates the end of this first installment. So I put down the magazine and hug Burt and he suggests I wait until my twin sister is in bed asleep and then come upstairs and we'll make love. I sneak to our bedroom (sister's and mine) and put on a salve that will protect me from sexually transmitted diseases, I wipe off some white residue off the chin just below my lips (like Alka Seltzer foam). I think, "Too bad, one has to be concerned about such things, but I want to be safe and careful." I think Lydia is in bed asleep, but some part of me realizes she is right now upstairs with Burt. I find that amazing that we are sharing him and pretending we aren't. I go upstairs in eager sexual tension and Burt is there, smiling and loving. He's not mine for always, but mine for now.

I and Ellie and counselor are at a counseling session. Our task is to knit things as we work through our stuff. There is lots of distance between the three of us. I am knitting, I have a cast-on row and am trying to knit the first row, only stitches slip and nearly fall off and I am constantly readjusting the row and picking up stitches. I lie down and am aware that I could wiggle around and create sexual feelings and masturbate. I feel embarrassed, my face away from Ellie and the counselor. What if they saw my movements and figured out what I was doing? I sit up. I feel annoyed at Ellie. I am doing more than her. I go over to pick up two rows of cast-ons from previous sessions. They are on bent knitting needles or ink pens and stuck on a stand like an ink pen would be. I only find two and feel guilty I haven't done more, but then I feel this isn't fair, I've done much more, And I open a satchel bag and see (display) many cuffs and partial baby sweaters and blankets I've done, all in baby pastel colors, green and pink. I look over at Ellie angrily that I'm doing all this work, and she's doing only the minimal. (221 words)

I am at a school dance with my younger sister Lydia, pretending I am her age of 13. A young man (like Nate or Larry of high school) is drawn to me and I play coquettish 13 years old. It's time to leave, and as I go down the stairs, I start to look and act a bit older (16 years or so) and he is very enticed. I wear a sweater combo like in the 1950's. He follows. I run, laughing to my car and tell Lydia to hurry. We get in and he comes to the driver's side and wants to talk. I roll the window (wet from rain) down a quarter of the way. The window is a barrier for closeness and he asks me to open it more. I slowly, flirtatiously do so until it is full open. He wants to kiss me and I want it too, but hold off because of my tender age. I tell him I'm going to Judy's house to meet friends. He could go there too. We drive away, and I go to Judy's house, without Lydia now. I greet some girlfriends and soon he comes in and asks me to dance. I agree and we begin a slow dance. He bends down to kiss me and I turn shyly away. "I'm too young yet." "All right," he says, "but don't let anyone else kiss you. Let me be the first." I promise and we dance more closely, hugging; we know we are made for each other. [BL] (257 words)

I'm in a crowded classroom and the rows are all in one direction, but I am seated facing the opposite way. A young man I am interested in sits in the back (see drawing) and as I pretend to be talking with my friends, I am watching him. I pick up my book, a play and look at page 171 and then back up to about 131. Some of the pages have come loose from the staples in the center (saddle stitch binding with 2 staples). (86 words)

I am driving a car, leaving an airport and going to find a hotel to stay in. My father is coming along for the ride so he can find a place too. Suddenly the road becomes graveled and the VW bus is jerked over from the right side, which is paved over a bump to a gravel road on the edge of a lake. I look in my rear view mirror on the left door quickly to see if any cars are coming. They are far back, no danger. I am amazed the sudden switch was so smooth and none of the passengers were bounced up and bumped their heads on the ceiling (like Paulina in Mexico). I drive on. We're looking for S City. I see two children playing in the lake. I say, "I think this is the wrong road." I see a hill and suggest we go up and see if that leads back to the freeway. If not, we'll turn back. I feel like it will lead us to the freeway. We get out and walk. We come to a house and open the window and step in, on the couch and antique coffee table, and as we walk through the house, a man comes from the left and says, "What are you doing?" I am embarrassed, suddenly realizing I'd entered someone's house uninvited. I explain and he says, "OK," so I go to the hill and try to walk up it. It's sandy, steep and I grab at clumps of weeds and grasses for handholds. The way is hard and I am aware of how out of shape I am! I get close to the top and see I'm not going to get to the freeway, so I return back to the house. The man walks me back the way I came. I see the front door to the right and think he'll let us out through the door, but he doesn't. He opens the window and we step around the coffee table, step on the couch and out. He says, "I am reminded of a redhead from New York," something about antique. We go on. (361 words)

And as I do this, he turns so he's facing me. He's on top of me and I feel his hard dick and at first he can't seem to get it in and I reach down and help him. Between us, we get him in and it feels marvelous. We joyfully make love. [BL] (114 words)

I am a teacher and new. I'm being asked how I'd handle certain situations and I'm pleased to notice that on several occasions the boys would get me into a no-win power struggle and I'd make my statement and walk away and then they would comply. A man asks how I'd handle a fight and I'd say, "Stop!" I'd put my foot pedals between the two fighting boys and I'd yell, "Stop!" to them and to the observing kids who entice them to continue by their attention. Then I decide to lecture on the contents of a Playboy magazine. This is quite controversial, but I continue. I show them page after page of advertisements and then political articles. Finally a naked man and a naked baby are seen. The man's penis is tucked in between his legs as he lies on his side. The baby boy is very sweet and cuddly and chubby and I pass him around for the kids to see. Two girls have him on a table and are admiring his sweet smiles. His penis is just a part of who he is and isn't important. (189 words)

A family reunion of the V. side. I have photos of some of us as children and people (aunts) want to see them. Someone sees my face and says it reminds them of ___, a cousin or relative. I am amused and say others have said I look like ____, another relative, and as I see my profile, it keeps changing so that eventually we all at some point resemble one another. Everyone is going to use the photos and make historical videos and I see that Aunt Rosalie is the first one to get her crew together (her kids). I hope to use her kids to help make mine later. A man (William B Hurt) is seated, looking at me through his round spectacles (frameless glasses). He has big, serious blue eyes. I walk over to him and say, "I work here. I mean, I'm the owner; what can I do for you?" He seriously hands me a bill for $833 for his services (maybe a plumber or a carpenter). I say, "But I've paid this, I think. Let me check." I find my checkbook, but it's dated 10/3, too early. I find the right one and prove to him I've already paid. He hands me a pen. I take the top off and find a "short ____" in there that somehow represents my relationship with Howard. (228 words)

I am going to a bookstore and start walking, hoping to catch the bus. It's two minutes until the bus is expected. I'm on 14th street and am headed for 10th. The walking is hard going and painful. I get there. It's a conveyer belt of canned goods. A woman helps check them out. They are packaged up in plastic crates with an identifying tag so you know what's yours and where one stops and the other starts. Now I'm watching couples at a "butt watching" fair or gathering. Three couples, all dark, straight hair, dark complexion (Italian) are together. One woman is very upset and a man is trying to help her. He holds her quarters for her without taking any. She doesn't trust he has done so sand asks another woman to check for her. The other woman counts the eight quarters and the one silver dollar and hands them to me to hold for her. It's confirmed and she hugs the man. They are very close, cuddling. His arms are around her as she leans her back into his chest, then feet out in front of them, intertwined. The other woman says, "You can't do that if your not going to get married." This makes them think because they were intending to be just very good friends until she was cured and then she would go on and marry someone else. She looks over and sees the man's best friend and decides to marry him. This causes the man to turn and look long and searching into her eyes. He now wants to marry her. I think she wants it too and was using a ploy to get his attention. [BL] (283 words)

The dark-haired woman has a big bottle of perfume they had bought at the butt watching fair together that was supposed to be long lasting. A leak springs up in the bottle and she pours the perfume into another container. There is no smell; they were duped. She decides to return to the fair and demand her money back. She enters the library. A man with a disabled foot (there are two that work there) asks what she wants. I (now her) say, "I want to complain to the fair committee and get a refund." He asks my name and limps off, his foot looking like he'd been trapped in a ski boot remover. I follow and stand by three men reading books who comment on Michigan being a place where people can go to a meditation conference. I say, "Well, that makes good sense in the winter, a good place to do it." I hear my name called, "Barb Sanders," and look up and see the fair committee walking by saying, "And Barb Sanders has a complaint to put before us as well." I realize I'm on now. Short notice but oh, well. We enter a room and I sit. It's a conference room (see drawing). I sit. He asks me to tell my story and tell what I want. I do and as I go on, he interrupts me. They grant me my money back and I feel annoyed he interrupted me until I fairly realize I was being long-winded and had got my point across already. I Leave. Now, the men are talking about holding their own butt watching contest and making lots of money, but my guy is thinking of declining. It's not as fun as just being as contestants, and besides a man newly married should be home watching his own beloved's butt! (308 words)

I'm in a big house. I've been married to Howard for years, but we've not connected in any way, emotionally or sexually. I decide it's time to leave him. But then I realize this time, I'll have to take the girls with me. I have no excuse this time. I'm older, done with school, and walking. I feel real fear and resistance. I don't want to take the girls. That will be so very hard, to be a mother, to be there. [BL] (82 words)

I'm in my wheelchair and my job is to try out a downhill path to see if it is accessible. I have an able-bodied woman with me who looks like a community college student from Women's Center, possibly lesbian, but mostly abused. We get to the top of the path and I look down and she says, "Well, what shall we do?" I say, "It looks pretty bad. I'm not sure." Lots of AB students are walking around me. I decide to try the path and somehow we slowly manage to get down the path, talking with people as we go. They ask how to help and I'm not sure how to tell them. A man in a manual goes by on another downhill place and calls out a friendly challenge. He admires me. We get to the bottom and I think, "Let's go," but then I realize in order to do a good job, I need to go back and do the path again to find the specific places where it is too steep or the stairs too tall. I'm afraid to tip my chair over those stairs for fear I'll fall, but I decide to take strong spotters with (I am unaware in the dream I have actually already managed doing the path). I get to the top and look for the beginning of the path again, but can't see it. I find an elementary school and go in looking for signs telling me how to get to the gym downstairs. I can't find it and walk past the clothes shop areas and so on and then start walking (now with braces on my feet and wearing a brown pleated skirt and a blazer) upstairs. I see student teachers on the bleachers as I walk up. I realize they don't know how hard this is for me because I'm not in my chair and they don't know the difficulty of a difficult mother or a woman (how it cripples them). I get to the top hall and realize I'm going up and not down and can't find the gym. A woman comes over to me and says weakly like she's going to faint, "Did you know if a woman can be in trouble if her period starts like a tidal explosion?" I look around for help for her.

There are a man and a woman and me. The man and I kiss. It is very nice. He says, "You must kiss her now." He pushes me. I resist and give an "air" kiss very close to her mouth. He says, "Am I pushing too much?" She says, "Yes, let it be." When I kiss the man, I want to hug him too, but don't. Something holds me back. He's a writer, the creative part. (76 words)

I have been quietly exercising in my house and now I go for a jog. I come out of the house through a tunnel-like opening like from a basement. I slowly run. It is hard at first, but then I get better. Fluffy is with me. Now I'm returning, running easily in the rain. I feel good. I have camaraderie with my cat who lays down every once in a while to get her tummy rubbed. I call to her often to keep up with me and pet her tummy. Then Fluffy wanders a bit toward the road and I see a vehicle coming and I am concerned she might get run over. It's almost like the fact that the vehicle is there that attracts her like hypnotism. I call to her. The vehicle is a house trailer with segments like washing machines and dryers. She gets caught by the skin of her side/belly. The vehicle is nearly stopped in its concern not to harm her. I get her uncaught and we then go to the house, open the front door and enter, passing Howard and another man who are on their way out. They come back in. I try to ignore them, but know they are attracted to me and I feel sad about Howard. We've lived together all this time, but not in relationship. I rub Fluffy's tummy and see the wedding band on my finger and feel sad that I give more love and attention to the cat than I do Howard. I go into his bedroom to take off my wet layers of jogging jackets. I lay them out to dry on the floor. Then I put on my old jeans and mauve tee-shirt with laces and admire how good it feels to be slim and trim and in good physical condition again. (307 words)

I enter a square room that is sort of a vacation cabin. It has been unused and neglected for years. Today I am cleaning it up. Old food, all moldy and yucky, is in cupboards and the sink and on counters. I don't relish the job but it must be done, so I dig in and start cleaning. Howard is around somewhere. [BL] (62 words)

I am given a home video camera and I begin to film what I see. I have some trouble keeping things in focus and also keep forgetting that I'm in charge. I'll hum and then remember that the camera will pick up that. Or I'll not pay attention to what's in the frame and then remember and shift focus. I hear background noises of a huge crowd cheering and as a satire joke, I film a race of toy motorcycles. Then I see a scene of small plastic people and I film it, chuckling to myself at my creative cleverness. I turn a knob that changes the focus spot from a circle to a square and back again and I adjust it back and forth. I took a picture of the picture on the TV screen. Now I see through the camera viewfinder a good-looking man. I like him and start to show him my editing choices, feeling excited about sharing with him how good I am and anticipating his approval of me. But he's doing something else, like wanting me to take a picture of him and not listening to me. I stop mid-sentence and feel disappointed and frustrated. I then concentrate on focusing on his beautiful eyes. I go in for an extreme close-up and back out for his full, lovely face. (224 words)

A woman like Katrina is teaching me to be a light. I try and then I become this beautiful light, like a tinkerbell, with xmas lights flashing. I am flying around the living room, landing in different places here and there. A man comes in and is trying to get me. My light gives me away. He chases me as I move from place to place. Katrina tells me to flap my wings and fly up high. I try, but it is hard. I go through the layers of wood in the frame of the house and he is on the opposite side, nearly getting me (see drawing in dream book). Finally I flap my wings very hard and get going very fast and shoot up into the heavens. [BL] (129 words)

I am back at work in an office. I am on the phone talking to someone in this huge house I live in. The dancers have arrived and I say, "Oh, good. I can't wait to come be there. I'll finish up here and get home when I can." I turn and a man has come into the office. He's very pompous and upset about the swimming pool. His friend can't swim and nearly drowned. So he wants us to build a better swim pool. Someone tells him we don't have money budgeted for that. He is indignant, that money would be more important than a man's life. I say, annoyed, "Why don't you help him then?" He is upset and says, "I can't swim either." I say, very coolly, "Then learn to swim," and dismiss him. He's one of those demanding crazies and I want to get out of here and go enjoy watching the dancers. Then several other people come in, and I think, "Oh, well, even if I only get to see the night performance, it will be good enough," even though I felt disappointed. A woman wants to join a woman's support group. I notice Jennifer H and another woman there. I say, "Oh, they wanted a group too; three would be big enough to start one, maybe others would join later." We set a time to meet. Then I start a dream group and it is very
