 full. We start working on a dream. Fred tells his dream. Hands are raised with ideas and answers. I act like a teacher, calling on people and lecturing after their response. One woman in front of me really wiggles her hand, wanting to be called on. I feel bad I didn't get to her. Uncle Lionel stands up and writes on a paper the time and puts it up on the wall, like a good student. It's 8:10. I decide we've gone 1/2 hour and so I say, "It's a good enough place to stop." Everyone starts leaving and I say, "Wait, I'm not done yet." A few stand, waiting. I feel a coughing fit coming on and I see a large cup of water. I wave them away, saying, "Never mind." (374 words)

I have acquired a large mansion with extensive lawns and gardens of a formal nature. I am well dressed, slim and trim, in black patent leather heels, black skirt and a purple and black flowered halter top with spaghetti straps. I look out over the vast lawn and see African dancers. I am surprised they aren't Native American like I'm used to, but realize things move on and this must be honored as well. I go out to dance with them, but stay on the outskirts of the huge circle of dancers, being careful not to be disrespectful and intrusive, but wanting to be a part of it all. I dance South American calypso kinds of steps. After that, I decide to go see how the man I've hired to clean up and weed the garden area is doing. He's been there two days now and I think I owe him $75.00 by now. I go to the garden and he's got lots of area cleaned out. The plants look like large lettuce leaves all closely grown together. Then a woman asks where the door is, and I turn and look at the house. I see where the door was and go around the house to the left and find a door. I go in to see what's inside this new shop; nothing much. I figured out it's a lunch counter, but so new the menu isn't up yet. I see Ellie eating a sort of thing like a taco/hotdog. I ask her to come over and help me retie my left strap on my halter. It's two straps that had been tied together but she chooses to tie each one separately. It seems to work. I go outside to find the gardener man to pay up my $75.00. He wants a written receipt and I say, "I have lots of paper, no problem." Only as I pick them up, each sheet has some scribbles or notes or lists on them. I can't find a fully blank sheet. I offer one with only a few scribbles on it (like Charla's drawings), but he refuses; it must be blank. Then I realize if I'm going to keep this vast lawn area kept up, I will have to hire a gardener full time or it will all become overgrown and wild. I look up to the windows in my mansion. I think, "It's too bad don't have very much money or furniture, but if I carefully place things at the window, I can still manage to enjoy the view of my huge lawn and garden." (433 words)

I am told that Howard has made love to young boys and molested some girls. There are some feelings that my father has too. I (or my mother) ask him, "Do you know anything about this?" He is annoyed with me that I would ask and changes the subject by asking me a question. I don't know the answer and he is actively disappointed in me. I feel betrayed when I realize this is an avoidance tactic. I lay down on the ground next to a mushroom growing and I knock it over. I sit up and see what looks like an erect penis laying beside my head, little roots still on it. It looks painful being ripped out of the ground like that. (124 words)

I am in a play and acting well. We are two sisters and a dolly in a crib and we have our backs to the audience. At one point, I turn the dolly so she faces the audience and suddenly I am aware of them. We turn to face the audience and I now see their faces. They are very happy about the fact that we are including them. They now don't have to work so hard to get the words. But as soon as I'm aware of them, I feel a spurt of adrenalin and break my concentration. I become afraid I will forget my dialogue, and with the fear comes the knowing that I will. I don't know what to do; I feel panic. Later, I am preparing a picture of the scenery for a play. I draw in a toilet and a bathtub. I show this to the director and he points out I didn't need to do that because there already was a toilet and a bathtub. Feeling frustrated that I went to extra work for nothing, I agree to cut out the new addition. I ask the director how we are to hang up the pictures on stage. I see wires and clothes pins to hang them on. Now I'm rehearsing, worried I'll forget my lines and knowing I must really concentrate for 1 and 1/2 hours or so on my lines, but not wanting to do all that work. I go to the director who's back stage behind a counter top caged area (like in PE room). He asks how I'm doing and I sigh, "I'll try to work up to your standards, but I'm not good enough." He is surprised and concerned. This is not a good attitude for an actress to have before a performance. I walk away and lie down on a bench and cry out, "I'm sick. I'm sick." I feel tired and very bad. I don't want to perform. (330 words)

High school friend Dora and I are talking about my upcoming connection with Willie. I am going to have some kind of relationship with him and she is warmly encouraging me. She says, "He really loves you." I say, "But I don't love him." I hasten to add, "I like him a lot, but I don't love him." I go to meet him and we talk. Now it is the wedding ceremony. I wear a straight 1920's kind of gown and a long veil. There are rows and rows of people seated (see drawing in dreambook). The two center rows are for family and are canopied. We walk all around the seated people. At one point, both Willie and I walk with my limp and a cane in precision, I matching my cane thumps to his, my left foot turned out. Later, we walk ceremoniously and slowly. As we get to the corner, to proceed down the center aisle, I lose Willie in the crowd as he went ahead and I'm not sure which way to go. I then choose the right one (the main one) and we reconnect, going the full length of the aisle to the front. At the left in the front row are my "parents" and Granddad Lloyd. We turn to face them and ceremoniously kiss them (the parents). Then we turn to the other side, where we kiss his parents (who aren't there) and a picture of a baby who died long ago whose name is B (Berta, Bertha or something like that). She was Dora's and Willie's baby. Now the ceremony is over and the dancing begins. Willie and I dance for hours. Now he is tired and I lead him off to the side. He asks for a glass of water, some specific kind of water he always drinks, "authenticated, hard" (like a mineral water). His sister, "Peggy Sue" (really Sonja), comes by and tiredly takes my coat off my back and puts it over his head like a tent. She's done this millions of times and resents it or believes it's only indulging him. I waft air at him and give him the glass of water. Later, he is in a tiny "room," our honeymoon hotel room, only its all still at this place where we got married. It is clear he and I won't have sexual relations. He'll discreetly continue his sexual relationship with Dora. (404 words)

My grown daughter is pretty. It is the 17th century or so (Little Bo-Peep dresses). Three young princes are captivated by her and join us for lunch at a beautiful table. The table has wooden boards or flaps where each person sits. You reach down there and bend it until it folds up into a square. I do that. The boy's father, the King, comes by, and is intrigued with my wit and innocence. I hardly notice him in the sense that I fawn over him. I'm aware I like him and he's handsome and am glad he chooses to stay with us for lunch. We chat. Later I go walking and I see a series of little deformed boys. Their tongues hang out to the side, their legs are unusable and thin and spread out, like they have CP but they don't. Some tongues go to the right and some to the left, but the basic deformity is the same. I wonder how they can sit up like they do without leg support. Now my daughter and I go for a walk, only it's me, alone. I had decided to think the daughter with me because I remembered a woman in this time period should never walk unattended. I come to the house/palace of the King. He's inside watching me. He has a big museum display in front and I stop and watch and look, very interested in all the displays. I watch little miniature weaving looms working and am entranced. I stay a long while and go clear around to the back of the exhibit, looking at stuff there. He comes out to join me and I look up startled. I say, "Oh! I didn't see you." He says with a sweet smile, "I thought it best to come out and supervise when someone is so intently inspecting my family background." I smile and agree that could be uncomfortable. He is pleased I have such interest in him and his stuff. We walk now toward the house and we enter a room. He says it's the goose house where he'd sneak into the palace through it as a child. In a side room I see a big Mother Goose peering at me suspiciously. I see feathers (white) on the floor where I'm standing. The King says, "When I was a boy, sometimes she'd let me pet her babies." I walk into her room, holding a pink stuffed baby doll. The King says, "She won't let you touch her babies." I hold out my dolly for her to touch, glad it's just a dolly and not a real baby, just in case she hurts it. She sniffs and then touches it, and then lets me touch a baby dolly of hers (blue stuffed). The King is impressed and I feel happy and pleased and honored. The king and I are going to be married. We walk on toward the palace. (491 words)

I am living in a long narrow set of rooms, downstairs. I am hosting an OCA conference and am cleaning up and organizing after the people left. A woman neighbor comes in and shows me a lovely dress she made herself. We chat about all the extra traffic in the neighborhood with my guests. Then she shows me how she made the dress with snaps up the front and she graciously offers it to me if I want it and think it would be easy to use. I accept with pleasure. Now it's time to go for a ride on my horse. It is lovely, strong, healthy and frisky. I get up (no saddle), and we ride, happily running. It is effortless. After a long run, I pull up at a deep river where a man lies in the grass and watches me. I am unaware of him. I lie down and take my top off and sun for awhile, and then I get scared because what if I didn't tie down the horse properly and it goes away. I would be stranded and unable to get back home, too hard to walk back with arthritis. I double check the reins and hang onto it hard. I lean over and peer into the river and feel nervous with how deep it is and worry about falling in. Now I ride back home. We are like one and it is very effortless and nice. I bring the horse into my rooms and turn on the water faucet in the sink and it drinks. Then I spend lots of time grooming it. I feed it hay. It is important to take care of my good horse.

There are two railroad tracks going in different directions. I'm being chased. I hide under a table, a big round one with a long table cloth that goes to the floor. There is a hole in the floor and I go in there and someone covers it and makes it look ordinary. The man chasing me is very suspicious and looks over carefully, but the camouflage works. I then start running very fast around and around under that huge table in order to exercise and build up speed, strength and endurance so I can escape. My helper warns me not to run so close to the table cloth because as I bump it, it will give me away my presence to the man chasing me. Finally I am in good shape and I am ready. The cloth goes up and I sprint out down a huge aisle where an audience of people is painted on the floor. I run and run and have to be careful not to mistake the real audience for the painted one.

I am seated in the front row of the audience with friends (Bonnie, Tyler). I now get up and walk up the steps of the raked auditorium (like a school gym, M City High, the old one). I go higher and higher, noticing that the higher I go, the fewer people there are, and the "lower" the intellect and class they have. I reach the top and it's just empty seats. I walk across to the righthand aisle and walk down. Some of the steps are like steep dirt banks I have to jump. I get almost down to where I was and cross again to the left and then return to my seat. As I pass my friends, they excitedly tell me that a Fire Fair is going to happen, like I'll be thrilled, but I'm a bit annoyed because it's like when people tell me some thing about disability, I've heard it all before and I do have other interests besides disability.

I am helping to teach mentally retarded people. In a classroom, they are all seated in a single row around the edges of the wall (see drawing in dream book). I have lots of things on the board and I'm trying to get them to understand. Then it's time to go and there's a bus and we're high up on a mountain and it's a long, curvy road back down. (70 words)

There's a pool or stream and a little fish is in it. I lean over to see the fish and I suddenly rear back because a huge goldfish comes up out of the water, toward me. He's as big as I am! I go uphill to get out of the way. He might bite me. Now I'm seated at a table and Howard and Bob H are looking at me. Howard says, "Look at her eyes, her face. She's getting an idea." They watch as I sit and stare off into space, my eyes in REM. They come over to me and watch as I start righting (writing) my notes, an outline: 1) Research of project, 2) get examples of what's currently out there. Bob agrees with me that we must gather all the leading communications skills programs used in schools and see what's there and then create a better one. I look at Howard's face and feel sad because I can see he's different (his eyes are different), but I still have the old automatic disgust and anger. I feel badly that I can't seem to respond to him differently now (see poem in Dream poem directory). (198 words)

Curtis Salgoto tells me about a childhood experience. His alcoholic father would go pass out in different places and once he had to go to a neighbor's house, a girl, and retrieve his father from her bathroom. He said her bathroom was bigger than anything in E City! I laugh and enjoy that image. He then tells me how as children they were each tied to the opposite leg of a big person and she wrestled him and she won and she couldn't understand how he could stand the humiliation of still being tied together. He shrugged and said something like, "You do what you have to do," and then he unpeels himself out of a stick of mud and goes away. Now I'm mixing water and choosing a color pattern to mix (knit) for a sock. I see argyle patterns and different colors like in a color palette, but on this notebook paper - muted greens, etc. I choose one and drop it in the ocean to be mixed. I read the instructions on sizes of knitting needles, #5's. Then I work the mud like in pottery. Now my hands are caked with it and I want to go inside for awhile. I walk to the front door and call to my mother who panics and darts (lunges) toward me as though she thinks I'm hurt. I laugh and say, "I'm OK. It's just me. I did not want to get your house dirty and I want to put it back on when I come back out." She can't understand why I do this. (265 words)

I am a white woman, but have lived for years as a sort of servant/family member in a Chinese family. I have a tiny old room filled with all my possessions from the years. There's not anything worth much, just sentimental value. I go to a fair, where white people are, and stroll among the booths. I see pink, crystal-like rocks that are crafted into little souvenir dolls, and I see photos, each wrapped in a plastic wrap, jewelry, etc. I choose not to buy anything. People sort of expected that of me; I never do "the ordinary." I now am walking back to my home and I see a vast ocean, a beautiful blue color. The color is quite special and I am entranced by it. I see a whale fluking his tail (tale) and then feeding right at the line where the gray shallow water and the blue deep water meet. I feel intense joy at the privilege of seeing this beauty. I am so drawn to it that I feel pulled like a lemming to swim out in it and drown - suicide, drown myself under the blue water, being swallowed by the whale. It's scary. Suddenly I turn and realize there is a man standing right behind me, ready to stop me if I choose to jump into the ocean. I notice his eyes are exactly the same shade of blue as the ocean. I am totally drawn to him. We sit and talk. He says, "Let's get married." I hesitate. We're strangers, but I know he's the one I trust. I say yes. I take him home with me to my Chinese family.

My family is going on a vacation and we are packing. I call us together and call out the items we need to make sure is in each suitcase: wallet, money, forks, spoons, knives, etc. We get all the stuff packed. I see a list of things. I read it over and over: sunset, blue sky, birds. It's like panels of torn paper collage pictures. Blue sky is repeated (see drawing in dream book). (74 words)

I'm trying to take my pills and I have a handful and sort them carefully. It's past time to take them. I see tracks driving down the river. There are two forks and they take the long way around. The water is up high on the wheel hub. There is construction and they are stopped when they try to get up on the road. They telephone to a woman to get better info on how long it will take. Now the construction delay is a hotel with a Ronald Coleman type owner and a gypsy woman pulls up in a circus car (a car with a carnival ride in it). She thinks if the two of them work together, they can keep people entertained and make money, turn the delay into profit. He agrees, so her troupe goes on stage and dances and sings. A woman is at the top of the waterfall hiding from the audience's view, ready to do her act. Now I'm her and I slide down the water and do a backward, graceful flip in a circle, and dance on down. The audience isn't all that impressed. The owner flicks the house lights on and off to stop the show. It's not working. There's only a few patrons in the audience, way off to the right. Now I'm the owner's lovely, gowned, jeweled and sophisticated fiance. He's got two TV remote controls and doesn't know which button to push. I try to explain. He tries them. I have an idea: we should make this a dance, not a show. I invite the audience to the ballroom. I'll play the piano and the Cary Grant type gypsy owner will add accompaniment with the musicians. I go to the ballroom and some follow. I sit at the piano and play a beautiful classical piece. A drummer and so on join me. Then we improvise a reggae piece. Then I'm playing a dance number. Lots of people are dancing. It's a success. Another woman comes over to spell me. I want to wait until the end of the song, but she places her fingers on the chord and begins. I stop playing and then she goofs up and that annoys me. But I now go looking for Cary Grant. I see the dancing people having a good time. I go into a bar lounge and see Cary coming out of a bathroom. He'd been helping a little boy. I think that's sweet. Then I go back into the ballroom and he's seated on the sidelines waiting for me. I walk over to him; we are going to dance. (439 words)

I am in my house cleaning up my bedroom. It's a mess. Ellie is following me around. Charla is also there. I look at their hair, wondering if Charla still has lice. I see Ellie's hair is cut very short (like a dyke lesbian's hair cut). Charla's is also cut short, like a pageboy cut. I see red sores on her head. Her hair is thin. I don't want to touch her. I give away a big box on my table stand next to my bed to Ellie's friend. I take three or four empty tape cassette boxes out of it first. There is dust on everything. I go into another room and feel something in my right ear. I pull on it. It's a dental floss string. I pull and pull. I can feel it inside my head. There is lots of ear wax on the string. I wonder how I managed to have left dental floss in my ear, but at last I'm getting my ear cleaned! The floss sticks to the wall and bits of dead leaves stick to it. I'm back in the bedroom and I look out the window and say to Ellie, "Look, here's lots of wood bits I can use." I see shingles and pallets, etc. stacked up outside. I start to leave the room and Ellie says, "But then we won't be together" (or won't be able to talk), and I say, "Well, then, you can come with me." She follows me as I go from room to room. I had remembered I had more rooms and was surprised now to see I really did have more. This is good news. I can get three or more roommates and make lots of money and get lots of help. Then I wonder whose rooms these used to be and if I could rent them out. Some of them had their things still in them. These rooms are spacious, nice and clean. My old bedroom is ugly, cluttered and old (see drawing in dream book). I see a fat woman and her kids cleaning one bedroom. I see lots of makeup jars and things on a dresser all dusted and tidy. I wonder out loud who cleaned this and how she's going to get paid. This concerns the woman who did it and thinks I'm to pay for it. In the next room I exclaim, "Oh, look! A washer." I won't have to use the old one outside and wonder if I should use this one. It really isn't mine. In the next room I see a closet filled with pretty little dresses, shiny satin material, shades of blue, sequined halter tops and I really like these dresses and wish I could wear them, but they would not fit. They are for a small, petite, slim person. I see a door and open it, and see the dining room table all laid out. I shut the door and see a small card on the wall. It's printed and says "Compliments should (or) sound Dwight." He's the one that owns the dresses and stuff. I think, "There should be a comma between sound and Dwight." I assumed Dwight is his first name. The next room has a refrigerator. I open it and smell the odor of a fridge left too long and see a few food items like butter. Each room had a made bed in it. Blue bedspreads (blue and white like the one Bonnie gave me). (583 words)

A small Native American village welcomes me and we have a party. An Indian woman is my friend. She introduces me to an Indian man. We like each other. He takes me to a wall that has pictures of the history of how white men harmed the Indians. I want to defend, but know I must first listen. It's a test to see if I am genuinely interested, or am going to be just another rude white person. I listen. The man and I make love. There is a huge diaphragm with cream all over it. I kiss the hollow at the front base of his neck. I feel love, but no sexual feelings. (114 words)

I am a (man) general in a war and I am alone in a field, the bombs exploding all around me. To protect myself, I lay down on the snow-covered, barren field. I dig a hole in the earth that fits my body and lie in it to wait out the war. It is cold. I am alone. Then I look over to my left and see girl children playing. I tell them to leave. Can't they see there's a war going on? Then I look around and notice the war is over. I get up out of my foxhole and follow the girls into a store. I look at the candy display. They are all out of the kind I like. A sweet little girl ( 8 or 10 years old) is there. Now I'm the girl. She and this little boy are Jack and Jill. They will be lovers when they grow up, but for now it is all innocent and sweet. They kiss and talk and share adventures. The general is now a grandfather and he lusts after the little girl. He sort of watches her, and follows her. She and Jack leave. She's glad to get rid of the sinister grandfather. Now Jack and Jill sit in a small boat, on the bare rock bed of a dry river bed. The water is being released upstream. It's like a carnival ride. I look upstream and see the surging force of the water and feel afraid. We'll be bowled over and drowned, so I say, "Let's wait until the big wave is past us." But we stay and the water picks up our boat and we swirl and sway down the river bed. It's fun. My girl cousins are there, Sonja and Deirdre. (296 words)

I see a mechanical device that pops up and pokes a person's eyes out. I then see a person walking away with bloodied eyeballs. I think to myself, "I can't believe I watched that. Now I'll be stuck with that horrible image in my head." Now I'm standing precariously on a small wooden platform just outside an open hatch or door on a boat. The waters (ocean) are cold, stormy and foreboding. A man stands with me and he points to the water and says that he is willing to jump in that dangerously cold water to save me if he has to. I feel unwilling to do that for him and devoutly hope I don't fall in. I back away toward the boat. (124 words)

I'm in a house. I go upstairs to find a place to sleep. I lay down on the floor and try to sleep. I am aware it is hard and uncomfortable. I have no blanket and know I'll get cold later. I feel sexual and encourage an orgasm. It feels good and I try to make it last. Then Nate walks in. We don't talk. We make love. He leaves. Then I decide to get up and go to the next room where there's a bed and covers where I can be comfortable. As I prepare to get in bed, Lydia's littlest girls all come running in wanting permission and money to go to the store and buy soda pop. I say, "No!" Then I notice they are all eating candy. One girl has a baby and holds her roughly by her hair. I rescue it and hold her in my arms. She's like a dolly, only alive. I realize it's 8 o'clock am and they haven't had breakfast yet. I'm tired because I haven't slept much. The radio had been playing loud and I'd tried to turn down the volume with no luck and so I'm tired, but the girls need a nutritious breakfast so I get up to fix it. Now I'm at Mary's house to visit. I hear her inside so I open the door and call to her. She's in the shower. I walk on in and see lots of women there. First I see Jennifer H. She's wearing a fake mustache like Groucho Marx or Charlie Chaplin. Then I see who all the women are. It's a dress-up party. They are all lesbians. Some women cut bits of their own hair and glued them to their mouths for their mustache. I look around, feeling out of place. (302 words)

I'm in the old M City house. It's 3:30 a.m. and I see Julie B outside. She is drinking water that comes leaking out over the gutter off the front of the porch. I invite her in. We sit on the couch in the living room. I introduce her to my brother Dwight. As Julie talks about some problem she has that makes her sad, I become aware that the heavy wooden mantle of the fireplace is shaking and slowly falling. It lands in the fire and Dwight pokes it so it will burn safely in the fireplace. I get up to go look for my room. I think Dwight and Julie stay in the living room. I go to where the "Recreation Room" used to be and I think this will be a good room for my combination office/bedroom. I imagine my computer in a corner, a single bed along a wall, and an artist/draftsman table at the window to do my art work. The light will be good there and besides that's where my mother used to do her art (see drawing in dream book). (187 words)

Now I'm outside a smaller house at the beach. I see the tide is rising and waves are breaking over the rock barrier. If I don't move, I'll get wet and the waves look quite large. I could get hurt as well. As the first waves are actually sloshing around my feet, I beat a hasty retreat to the house. As I get there, I see its foundation is solid, huge rock boulders. I am impressed and feel safe. I go in. I see small refrigerators in the kitchen, up on the counter, and am glad because that's easier for me to manage, like the house is made with my disability in mind. (113 words)

I am in a very huge and luxurious house. It's my parents (and our) new house. I am going from room to room, looking at each one, admiring how nice they are. First, I see my parents' bedroom. It's very nice, with skylights and modern furniture. Right next to it is a recreation room, with games and refrigerators. I go upstairs and find Dwight's room. It's spacious. I think maybe I'd like this one rather than the one next to my parents'. I'd feel uncomfortable sleeping next to their room like I'd hear them making love or something. Dwight (who looks like Jack Lemmon) and I look out the window. "Look, we even have a swimming pool." "Yeah, but it's got dirty water in it." "We could fill it up." It's long and narrow and only half filled with muddy water. "So, if we're so rich, where are the tennis courts?" I joke. I see a huge cement slab. "That's our neighbor's land," I say, "but look at his car." "What kind is it?" asks Dwight. "It has no nose," I say. Dwight laughs at my clue. "Then it must be a Volkswagen bus," he says. I say, "Look over there. It's got wings." We see a yellow VW bug with fenders converted to look like those 1950's fins on cars. I see lots of books on shelves in another room. Maybe I'd like that room. My mother (young, maybe in her 30's) thinks I should stay with my original bedroom because it's on the ground floor and I wouldn't have to struggle with stairs and get tired. Then she reconsiders. After all, if we are rich enough to get this house and all the nice things in it, then we can afford a stair lift so I could get to any place I wanted. We then go to an "outside" room (like over a garage with an outdoor entrance). It's my bedroom, she says. I look around and see tables and chairs set up for a party with streamers and so on. I look at a man smiling at me and realize he's the professional party giver and he's giving me the party meant for Linda W. I point out it's the wrong party. He apologizes and goes away. I look around the "suite," (see drawing in dream book). I see a small sitting room in Victorian dark woods and red velvet wall paper. I like that. I see an accessible bathroom. I look back in my bedroom and see a slim, narrow single bed (blue colors). I think, "I want more than that." I see a double bed. I then decide I want a room to have fun in and a small separate room just for comfortable sleeping with a small toilet room very close to the bed so I won't have to walk far when it's painful. I see it there and I'm pleased. Now, a man comes up the stairs toward my room and wants to talk to my mother. He is suggesting we expand the garage to accommodate more cars in the future. I say to my mother, "Don't let him nickel and dime us to death," (or my mother says, "I knew they would try to nickel and dime us..."). I walk with him to the garage and he says, "See, you may get more cars," and I say, "If we do, we can crowd them in or park them differently or build a carport roof to extend." He goes away. Now I'm going down the driveway and a car passes us and I see Sherry Lady in the passenger side and I say, "Oh, it's the ____ family coming to visit." My mother tries to turn the car so we can go back and greet them. Now I'm in the back seat of Sherry's car as her husband turns the car and Sherry is very upset at him coming so close to the cliff edge. He knows he's safe because he can see better from his vantage point. Sherry is scared and nagging at him to be careful (like my mother, Grandma Mildred, and me). Then, they (we) are driving toward our house and I see a car/truck drive into a pond. Sherry says something about, "Oh! Guilt!" like guilt is "___" something. I feel sorry for her daughter who has to grow up with this biased and unhealthy view of the world. (740 words)

I'm in my wheelchair, pacing. The engine is always on so I have to keep applying the brakes to stop. I have to be aware of going and stopping all the time. It annoys me. I'd like to have my regular joystick back. I'm on a gravelly, steep driveway. When I get to the top, there is a road. I look across and see huge curtains with huge clothespins on a wire. The construction company has put them up so we can't see what they are doing. I see canopy roofs of cloth that matches the curtains over train cars and buildings. I am concerned what are they doing that requires protection like that, and are they protecting us as well? I doubt it. I decide to go check out my new house. I stop at the door and stand, walking in, thinking (hoping) I had enough energy to manage without the chair. My "roommate" comes to the door and gives me a tour (see drawing in the dream book). I enter the kitchen and look, agreeing with her it is small. Where does the stove and refrigerator go? "Oh, I hate gas," I say. Her head is on one of the burners, which is lit. She likes gas stoves, she says, they work well. I worry about leaking gas. I look through a window down to the living room. She says, "We have to go out this door and around to the door into the living room." I say, "How odd to go outside and around." There is a steep ramp and someone is concerned and wants to hold on to me so I don't slip (I'm in slippers). I make it down, slipping a little. She says to me as we walk, "It must have been wonderful to have time to visit/talk with your mother. I agree and tell her how special and nice it was. "How do I get in?" I ask. My roomie is already in and peers up at me through a square, small hole. "Through that hole?" I ask. "Here, why can't I go through this door?" (a double Dutch door). "Are you going to put furniture against it?" She isn't thrilled, but "OK," she says, "I guess so." I can use the door. I go in and look around. It's very spacious. I say, pleased, "Why there are two, no, three, no, four fireplaces (all in a row) and a piano, no, two pianos?" I exclaim, "This is just like in a dream!" I look at the ornate, green, plush Victorian couches and chairs (overstuffed). She says, "That's my gun over the piano" (I see another gun, a rifle). I see pictures up on the wall and think I'll rearrange them to suit me later. I see a photo collage like my "Germany and Mexico trips" ones. I see a huge group photo of the people I'm currently working with up the hill. It's too big. I'll take it down, later. I suggest, "We could create little centers or rooms in all this space. Over there by the window could be the children's play area; and there, your study area, and we could have communication areas here and there." She agrees. I ask, "What's that room out the windows?" and she says, "The family room." I go out and see it's just an open veranda/porch, not a room at all. A neighbor man waves and starts talking at me. As he walks over, he tells me how he's been hunting for ___ and he names two animals. I don't understand what he called the second animal and he repeats it. (I spell it shire or shrik-mole.) I bend over to hear better and now looking at his head as he talks! (It's on the ground by the porch edge, like he has no body, or he's buried up to his head.) I think to myself, "I'd better not be so pleasant and open or he'll keep coming over and bothering me." I smile my polite, fake smile. I move on to see the end of the porch. I am standing next to a man and a cart of birds that he is plucking. One bird, the one he's working on, is a parrot, not a chicken, and it's very much alive. I feel queasy and don't want to be so close, so I chat with my roomie and try to ignore the process, which is probably painful to the bird. But I can't help but keep one fascinated eye on his hands on the birds legs and the birds eyes as they blink. (770 words)

A married couple lives in a house and Jennifer H lives with them. I sort of am Paulina sometimes, but most of the time I am an observer following her around. Paulina knows there's going to be trouble because the husband is beginning to be attracted to her. She asks me to call Lucy so she can get advice. I have a phone receiver at each ear and am listening to Lucy and Paulina talk. I hear someone pick up an extension and realize the wife is listening in and hope she hasn't heard enough to give it all away. She comes into the room and I hang up the phones. The husband comes into the room and the wife leaves. I have on thigh high black nylons and I show him a dress I've bought that is very short and sexy. He likes it. I put it back in the box and Paulina/me stands to walk out of the room. She is dressed in a simple black wool dress that accents her small waist and slim figure. A kick pleat at the back calls attention to her legs. She's wearing black high heels. The husband is very attracted. Paulina walks out of the room, mincing on the high heels like a Hollywood starlet. I follow her. As she walks down a hall, a good-looking young man sees her and follows her, attracted. She hears boogie woogie music and is going in search of the music to dance. She is sidetracked somehow in a dark hall that has a series of glass tanks like for reptiles or fish. People are in the bottom tank, trapped. She watches as they dig up to the top layer tank, but it has fish and water in it, no oxygen, so they dig further to the next bottom tank and then up. This time there is a black poisonous snake in the top tank and oxygen. A man standing next to me on my left is also watching. He casually picks up the snake to hold it while the people break through into the snake's tank. I say, "Be careful!! He's very poisonous." The man is not at all concerned and holds it like a pet and lets it writhe around his hand and arm, only carelessly paying attention to where the head is. Then the snake tries to bite the boot of the man and hits the floor with drops and a shooting spray of the white poison. "See," I say, "Look out." The man ignores me. The snake is sheathed from neck to tail in segments of cloth that serve as bandages. but are almost like clothes. The people manage to get to the oxygen so I leave and now see Paulina bouncing down the hall to the music. She almost passes the door where they are taking tickets. She hurries in and I follow. She goes across the room past an empty, carpeted dance floor where young collegiate guys are hanging out, and sits. As I reach where she is, I see she's changed her mind and has gone to sit in the middle on rows of chairs. She sits and lays two coats on the empty chairs to her right. The young man who followed her sits in a row in front of those two chairs with the coats. I sit on one of the coats next to Paulina. Now the dance instructor is there and she's talking the us and she nonchalantly takes all her clothes off as she lectures. Everyone is very shocked. I am queasy because I see her breasts and the nipples are sliced off. The red part is very large and where the nipples should be is a cavernous hole like in a thunder egg. It made me hurt just looking at it. Her body is not particularly pretty and the young college men are shocked and not too thrilled. She says that the body is a natural thing and should be treated that way; hence, she does not wear clothes. (676 words)

Paulina is sitting on a young man's lap and he points to my breasts and says to her in a cold voice, "Do you want these?" Paulina looks at me and then at him and he repeats the question, contemptuously. She isn't particularly interested, but the feeling is that she is beginning to realize she's a lesbian. Then the man says, "You disgust me," in harsh tones and points to my breast. I look and realize it is hanging out of my swim suit and is old, shrunken, with a nasty rash on it. I am embarrassed and shamed. I tuck it back in saying, "I need a new swim suit." Now, I am in bed with Howard and another woman. I am in the middle. We are all sleeping. It is late at night after a party and in his dorm room. We are naked. I sleep pointed toward him, laying on my stomach, almost like I was hinting he could approach me, but pretending I was just sleeping. He sleeps. He gets up and leaves. I turn my body so it is pointing to the sleeping woman. I feel funny about that and change my position. She leaves. I am alone and I see two college men with mop buckets and brooms open the door. They have clean-up duty in the dorm, and when they see me they quickly close the door. I continue to lie there. I know that they are plotting to come in and rape me because if I am naked in the bed in a men's dorm, I must be a loose woman and up for grabs. They come back in grinning broadly and evilly, pretending to mop and clean. I pick up the small, old-fashioned black phone and dial 911, just in case. Ethan's voice comes on the line announcing some place of business. I put my finger on the phone to break the connection but talk like I'm calling 911. The men decide to leave. I quickly get up, finding my bra on the side table. I look in the mirror and see I'm still dressed, except I don't have my bra on. so I carry it. I go into the small bathroom to brush my teeth with Howard's brush and use Howard's hair pick. My hair is wet like I'd showered and I pick at it to try and dry it some. I'm in a hurry and anxious. I hear little boys singing outside the window, "Whore, whore, whore." I see the wooden shutter is partly open and I try to hook the eye hook lock on both sides. It is hard. Then I leave. As I open the door to the hall, lots of college men are mopping the floor and I step quickly over the wet spots and hurry out. They all look after me like I'm a whore and they'd attack me if they had a chance. (489 words)

I am taking swim lessons and we are lined up at the edge of the pool and kicking our feet and legs. It is very easy and I am surprised. I look up and see an older man, the coach, come into the room and I feel shame and try to move away so he won't see me. He almost recognizes me, staring after me. He asks someone about the married couple. I guess there was some scandal and I was involved. As I'm swimming, I notice a tiny woman is in my arms like about 5" tall. We are going to swim together. She sees a line and wants to join it but I say that's the line for people trying to get in, but we're all ready in. We walk around to another side of the pool and I lie on my back and do the back stroke as she lies on my belly. I am very careful not to spill her off me or let the water wash her overboard. I swim three or four strokes to the deep end, turn and do the same number of strokes to the middle part. Back and forth we swim. Now she's a child and I am writing letters on her wet suit for her. It spells "Doctor Day..." Her father comes in and she says, "How do the letters look?" He says cheerfully, "Good, but, dear, the T is a little crooked." I say, annoyed with him for being critical and not just supporting the little girl's happy feelings of wanting to impress him, "I wrote those letters." He is embarrassed. The letters are upside down because I'd been standing at the head end of the suit when I wrote them. Now I am sewing a zipper pouch to the suit. The mother says, "How nice." She's learning how to manage the zipper now. (315 words)

A man wants to make love to me. I refuse him. I don't like him. He rolls over and lays on top of the man in bed with me; he wants a homosexual encounter with him. That is refused, so he rolls over again to try to seduce the young girl, a teen daughter of mine, and I am furious. I defend her and push him away. He is scum and I hate him. He disgusts me.

I am in a VW bus and I am following a man who is ahead of me and on foot. He starts wading across a shallow, wide river that has lots of algae growing in it. As I drive in, I feel concern and say, "Is this too deep?" He smiles and walks on. I continue to follow. It's up to my radiator but so far so good. Now I see trees, and two tree trunks are walking like each one is a foot and leg up to the thigh. I am amazed. Then I stop, get out and go up to some trees to talk with them. They are gentle, listening spirits. I get across the river and put down the luggage and the baby. I have to go find the airport. I walk and now I'm lost, and then I see airplanes taking off and know I'm close to the airport. I see a huge wall and a woman and myself climb it. It is hard and we have to grab silly ceramic things for hand-holds. We get to the top and look over with great disappointment - no airport, just farm land. It's like we had climbed a bulletin board of an airport and looked behind it. We go back down, talking about how hard it was and how tired we were and how disappointed. At the base of the wall stands my mother, Aunt Millie and cousin Sonja. I wonder how I'm supposed to get the bags and the baby, and who is taking care of the baby? I must have put her in a day care center in the city. I wouldn't have just left her at the river's edge, would I? There are lots of highways and attempts to get to the city. (299 words)

Sherry Lady is jealous of my skills. I've written a play and am being successful. She follows me around and watches what I do, wanting to be near me. I'm feeling pretty happy, and busy. I'm getting ready to go to a rehearsal or performance. I gather up a notebook I have and put in two of my favorite pens only to discover there are lots of pens in the notebook already. I remove three or four fat markers; most of the pens are black. Now it's time to go. I go find my "husband." He's filing things. I smile indulgently because my work is important, but his is more like a hobby. He buys Tupperware and sells it. He's unpacking boxes. I look in a box and see cute miniature boxes and glass jars that are pretty. I say to him, "I like Tupperware, but I hate the selling part." I also comment that I shouldn't take these cute things because even though I think they are pretty, I'll not be able to find any way to use them. I can't think of any tiny things I could put in them that would be useful to me. So we put my files and his boxes in the pickup truck and we drive away. I am driving. We have a hitchhiker and his belongings in the back of the truck, also. I see we're in trouble, the road abruptly ends, so I drive us over the edge to jump the chasm and successfully land on a grassy spot near the river. The hitchhiker's things end up falling in the river but my "husband's" things and mine are still safe in the truck. The hitchhiker is very mad at us. We dismiss his concerns as being unimportant. We feel sorry he lost his things, but we had done the best we could, so why is he mad at us? It wasn't our fault. We want to go get help, but don't want to leave the things unattended for fear he will take revenge and steal our things or ruin them. The women (two of us) go for help. The men (two) wait, guarding our things. (364 words)

Ethan is on stage and I go up and we make love. Then there is a rock star who drinks cough medicine or Tylenol and is addicted to it. I drink his bottle of Tylenol and get drunk. I'm seated at a table and Merle is watching me, enjoying the fact that I am behaving in a giddy, loose fashion. I follow the rock star and we make love. I am aware it's only a one night stand and go on. Later, I see him on stage and feel good about knowing I'd had sex with him. It feels like a delicious secret. I am surprised at myself for allowing myself to enjoy sex after so long a time. Now he likes me and pursues me. (126 words)

I am going up a mountainside. I am scooping up a fine dust into a container. I think the container is full, but then I notice several big rocks in it and empty the rocks onto the ground. Now there is lots more room in the container and I scoop up more fine dust. I fill the container. Now I am at the top of the mountain, which is shaped like female genitals. The top of the mountain is indented like the vulva. It's like a Phillips screw head with a "crossroads" in the top. On the left side, the gold has all been panned out, long ago. On the right side, there may be some left, but I'd have to work hard to get it. [BL] (126 words)

I am at "school" or "work." I go into a room and Jerome is there. I see small kittens and recognize them as offspring of Merlin the cat. I comment that, "It feels good to have a male cat because when he has kittens, they aren't my responsibility. It's Jerome that is stuck with the kittens." I pick one up and pet it. It's very cute. Jerome is busy and leaves. I lay down in his bed to sleep. I realize that I am on my period and I've gotten blood all over the sheets. I am embarrassed and don't want Jerome to find out, so I pull off the sheets to wash them. I find a small sheep skin and stuff in there too. I take it all to wash. I go down the hall to find the washers. A man I don't like says he's been transferred to another school. I smile and say, "Good for you. Congratulations." He says, "I'm surprised you're so pleasant, I didn't think you liked me." I didn't have the courage to say I don't. "I'm just glad you're leaving." I feel surprise because he's aware that I don't like him. I go into the room with the washer and dryer. I put the things in and now I think I only need to dry them. Bonnie is around and I want her advice. I go to take the stuff out of the machine and pull out my top hat from B's Follies, and 12 baby booties. There are some other things too. I go back and put the clean sheets on his bed and hope he won't notice. I start to leave. Only as I get to the door of the building, Jerome walks up and says, "Hi." He goes into his room and I walk down the sidewalk, hoping to get away. Jerome calls after me and I stop. I am aware that I am dressed very nicely, a yellow suit and nylons. Jerome has figured out I did that and is now wanting to go out with me. He suggests we go for a drive in his sports car. I don't want to. He's married and I didn't do his sheets so he would like me, I did them to hide my wrong doing, but I get in the car anyway. It's very low to the ground and I say, "I hope I can get out again." I'm in the passenger side and as we go, I notice it's hard to see up and over the dashboard. Jerome is very suave and flirty. Now I'm in the back seat and high school friend Dora is in the front next to Jerome. He calls her Betty, twice. We stop at a Mexican restaurant. I groan because I don't like Mexican food; It's too spicy. He says they have rooms in the basement, meaning a motel like place and I can see the handwriting on the wall. I don't want to have an affair with him, but I go in anyway. (509 words)

I am in bed with Merle. We lay on opposite ends of the bed so that our genitals meet in the middle. As we talk, he maneuvers his penis into my vagina. I don't resist and I don't particularly help. He is pleased he has done this and was a bit sneaky doing it. I am amazed at the full size of his penis. His small deformed feet and legs are up by my face. His skin is soft, not unpleasant, but not "normal." I feel some resistance, thinking this will mean I'll have to make love to him when I don't want to, like in a relationship. Then I relax into it some. Michael tells me he has kept a bulk file on me ever since I first met him. The disabled community did it. I am interested in seeing it. It has some articles on my hands. It has a secret file about my mother. She did something in 1942, or thereabouts (there were three or four dates) that wasn't exactly right. The newspaper article tells all. Aunt Rosalie is in it somewhere. I am glad to have this lost information. (193 words)

I'm in a car filled to the brim with relatives, I am amazed we can fit so many in the car. Everyone gets out, except me and the baby. I am annoyed because it is Aunt Rosalie's baby and now I have to take care of it. I hope she comes back soon. It crawls out and I have to retrieve it back into the car. Later, I watch a young blonde woman taking care of her baby. It is rambunctious and tries the mother's patience, but I am impressed with how patient and kind the young mother is. She talks soothingly and is aware the baby is just doing what it's supposed to do and she lays near it so she can keep it out of trouble as it explores its world. Now I see the skyline of Paris. I see the palace, the Eiffel Tower and a third thing (a landmark). I point this out to a taxi driver. I try to say "palace" and realize I mean "museum." I say "meuseo," like in French. He gets it. I'm a tourist and I'm going sightseeing. Now I am inside the old T City house showing the girls where my Grandmother Mildred raised her children, my past. The rooms are all changed and more spacious and modern and I keep pointing out to the girls that it wasn't this good when I lived there. The girls seem unimpressed. "Three bedrooms," they say. But, I say, "There were nine people and one of the bedrooms was added on later." We look in one bedroom. I wonder what kind of bed will be there. It is a pretty, brass frame double bed with yellow and white ruffly bedspread. Oh, this is Doreen's room that had been renovated for her more modern tastes. I had expected to see a single, plain bed. We go to the kitchen. In the hall before the kitchen I look in an open closet space and notice it's empty now. That's where they kept the dead, like the baby. In the kitchen, I look around for the current caretaker of this place. I see four sinks and think, "Just like in a dream, repetition." I see a pantry. I can't get back out because the stove and a cabinet have slid together. I say, "How do I get out?" One of my girls pushes them apart and we get through. I see a letter I had written the caretaker from Paris, telling them we'd be here on this date to see the old place. I wonder where they are and decide they left to give us time and space to review the past alone. Now I go outside and it's a huge dune at the beach. I walk up it very laboriously, sliding down a lot. I make it to the top only to see a huge dune sand worm (like in DUNE movie) rearing up. I turn and slide down the dune in terror. It chases me. I bury myself in the sand so it won't see me, at first fully under the sand but can't breathe, so I unbury my face. (526 words)

I am a beautiful young woman in perfect physical shape in a two-piece white bathing suit, like in those Beach Blanket Bingo movies or Gidget. I have my surf board. The men are all lounging around on the beach. As I approach the water, they laugh and scoff because this is their "turf" and I'm just a woman. A James Darren-type man watches with interest. I go out and surf very well, which amazes the men. I go back out and do it again, showing my stamina. Then, I choose to go out even farther than they dare, to the really big waves that are wild and deep. I have some trouble but make it in, I crash and get back up, sand all over me and in my mouth. I carry my board and go to a standing shower head and rinse myself off and drink the water, spitting it out to clear out the sand. As I am showering, a huge crowd of ordinary "tourists" come by, all carrying huge black spears. They trample my surf board and I interrupt them and pull by board to safety. I then cleverly point them to another beach so they won't infest the surfing beach. They go on. Now I meet the male leader of the surfers who is almost growling at me. He doesn't like me or rather his territory has been invaded. I coolly stand up to him. #2, James, is warmly proud of me. I then try to decide if I am going to surf at low tide and do a surf estuary. I see the water washing back and forth on the exposed rocks. I decide not too. Not much excitement in that. (286 words)

I am looking at glassware at a garage sale, a pretty glass platter and some hand blown glassware. It seems a bit spendy and though I like them, I choose not to buy them. I move on to the next table area, leaving room for other women to get the glassware. The next area is a huge sewing machine with a drawer that swings open to reveal thousands of brightly colored threads and bobbins. I close the drawer to get a better look at the miniatures underneath it, on the floor. I see a cunningly made sewing machine with recipe books that open, buttons that work and levers that work. I am impressed with the workmanship and the many things that really work. I next look at a small square box like thing made of logs that opens up on top and is a stove. I see a pile of small squarish pieces of wood that have lots of resin on it so it will burn well. Someone puts one in the stove and lights it. I am amazed that the wood stove doesn't burn down with the wood fuel! How does it do that? (195 words)

I go down some stairs. I enter a room. An older, slightly pudgy man is there. I am accompanied by a man. The older man is smiling at me in a neutral sort of way. I come into the room. He shows me a garbage disposal unit that shoots out acid and kills or disfigures anyone who accidentally uses it. I am shocked. "What about the children?" I ask. "If they don't know this danger is there, they will be hurt." He shrugs. It doesn't matter to him. He smilingly tells me this whole room is booby trapped like that. I am afraid now to move because I don't know where the traps are. I look over at some sinks and reach over and kick at the side panel of the cabinet. The cabinet faces the man and the man gets concerned because, I guess, I have found a potential trap and it is pointed at him, not me. He moves quickly. A cat is attracted to the sound of a frightened bird flying out of the room and the cat (the helper man who was with me) runs in pursuit of the bird. Now I'm really scared because I'm trapped in this crazy room. I see some pills on the floor and run suddenly to get them. The man tries to get them before I do, but I scoop them up in my hands. He could easily take them out of my hands and I know that. I edge away, hoping my helper man comes back soon. I feel frozen with fear because if my helper man doesn't return from his hunt. I am going to be eaten by this older man and he will crunch my bones in his teeth after stripping off all the meat. Then I feel confident that all I have to do is wait and this man can't hurt me and then the freezing fear would return. (323 words)

I see some new kittens that are very cute and go over and pick up several of the youngest ones. I pet them and they are at first afraid and then calm down. As I sit on the lawn holding the kittens, I look up and see Rover's sweet face as she crawls up to me to be petted looking as though I would send her away or hit her. I am shocked because I thought she was dead. I wonder if she'd been buried alive all this time or if the girls had not told me the truth and had let her go and not put her to sleep. I feel sorry for her having been buried so long with no one to pet her. I can see she desperately needs affection and love. I pet her and talk softly to her, hoping we aren't hurting the new kitties as they sit on my lap, now scrunched by Rover trying to get close to be loved. (167 words)

No images; just a feeling that the older man who eats bones (my old animus or my physical body) is softening up and being more safe to have. (28 words)

High school friend Dora and I are walking to town and come to the bridge that goes across the river. This town has two rivers in it. As I start to walk on the bridge, I am shocked to see that boards are rotten and holes come through the wood. This is an arched sort of oriental shaped wood bridge. I am afraid to set my foot down and then realize that this hasn't yet happened, but is on the verge of happening. I gingerly walk across, afraid I'll fall through at each step. I look out at the quick rapids in the river and am afraid. I see an animal "caught" in a skin of water. I say, "Is that a dolphin?" Dora says, "No, a seal." He's having a hard time making it through the tunnel enclosed around him. I decide maybe I should move from this town so I don't have to always be going across this dangerous bridge. It makes me sad because I like this town. I remember we left our luggage and ask Dora if we shouldn't go back and get our luggage. She says we came here to get the key to our luggage. She asks the guard at the end of the bridge for the keys. He gives them to her and we go back across. I see Dora/Jennifer H hanging by her knees in a swing thing on a tree, laughing. (240 words)

I am seated in a classroom with lots of different-aged people, kids and adults studying together. Someone is at the board writing words down for the "game." I don't know the game and only half attend to the words as I also watch others. Some of them go up to the board and click on their video/computer things and look at colored images on the blackboard. Someone talks about the importance of the lap words. I realize I should write down those words that were already erased off the board. I remember the word "warf," I remember "gasoline" and "Tylenol" But then I realize the last two words aren't the "lap" words. I go up to the board to try and see if any of their words could still be read after they were erased. I complain that it's dark and the colored images overlap where the words had been. "How can anyone see the words like this?" I mumble. I go back and sit. I remember one more word "III," and write it. A boy comes over and wants to know did I remember to get him a pen knife. I smile and say yes. He's happy. I wonder should I give a knife to a boy so young. I feel sorry he has to study this with adults. It must be frustrating for him. (226 words)

I am traveling in my wheelchair down country roads. I want to go to a resort town. I come to a cliff where the earth stops and a huge tree is the only way down. I get out of my wheelchair and shinny down the tree, literally getting out on limbs and feeling shaky and not too safe, but managing to get from one branch to another and on down to the ground. I'm in Mexico now and at a hotel with Paulina, my daughter. There are American tourists around but I don't really like them, sort of the ugly American type. I speak Spanish as best I can and can't remember lots of words. I go on a tour with a woman employee of the hotel. She shows me a path next to a river and we walk. I see a square bit of water and say, "Is this a lake?" She says, "No, it's a massage table." I look again and see it's a water bed kind of mattress and is next to windows where a person could be soothingly massaged while seeing the beautiful landscape. I want to do that. Then I notice a huge stairway and realize that is the front (el frente) of the hotel and we had taken a circular path from the hotel around it to the front. The guide is pleased that I noticed. I go back in and go to a buffet breakfast. I find fruit and look for pancakes and so on. Then Paulina and I go to our room and I have her try on a beige lace dress I want to wear. We are going to refit it so I can wear it. I pull up the waist and realize that if I wear it as is, it will be fine. I am surprised because I thought we'd have to spend days fixing it. I try it on and say, "I hope I remembered to pack my slip," because the dress is see-through with all the lace. I realize I still look pretty good and the fat belly actually looks kind of alluring, like a belly dancer's belly. (360 words)

I am in a big house where my detective dad Nick Nolte and my mother and I live. We are upstairs (reminds me a bit of Canton house). My father is asking me what I am doing. "I am cleaning up my room," I say, trying to please him. I fold up sheets and a bedspread. I put the pile on the bed, which is actually his and my mother's. Before he can say anything, I tell him I am only temporarily laying them there. I'm not just moving things around and making new piles. He waits. I hand him the pile and he starts to put them up on the shelf in a closet. My hand gets stuck in the folds of the bedspread and I'm being stretched up as he reaches. "Hey, hey, my hand," I say several times. He realizes and releases me. Then I pick up a pile of ashtrays near the bed. "Do you still smoke?" I ask. He says, "Of course not." I pick them all up and then decide to leave one small one for my mother because she hasn't stopped smoking. The ashtrays are a beautiful red glass. I ask Dad about his most interesting case he solved. He doesn't want to encourage me, but he does tell about one called Tom who would slap his leg a particular way that gave him away. I listened carefully. Then I look down the hall and see Tom with a gun at the head of Dad's partner. My father says to me, "Get back in there and whatever you do, don't try to be a detective." I should just do whatever he says. I go back in, but peek out. My father is gone, but this Tom is rounding up lots of people. I am surprised to see my Grandma Agnes and her husband. I am upset; she's an old woman and sick. Too bad he's bothering her. I creep down the hall and watch as he takes the group into another room. I hear the clicks of the gun being fired at this man's head, but I guess there are no bullets because nothing happens. I think, "Why don't these people all rush him, a man with out bullets?" But they are all afraid to be the first. Then Tom demands my sister Lydia cut some paper for him with scissors and I hear the same click from the scissors and realize he does have bullets. I remember an attic crawl-way and I sneak back into the bedroom and up into the attic. It's dark and I wonder if I remembered to bring food or anything because I'll be there for days. I quietly creep to where I can look down and see him. I am trying to wait for an opportunity to strike and get the gun. (475 words)

My mother wants me to go outside and enjoy the sunshine. I am lazily seated in a chair, like I haven't exercised in years. My father talks about his books. I ask why he's going to give them away if he loves them. He says he only loves a few of them. "But the music ones?" I ask. "Only a few; most of them were given by others and I have no interest in them." (75 words)

There is a team, a male writer and a female photographer. They travel around doing important news assignments. They are very good and I admire them. As luck would have it, the female isn't there anymore, maybe sick or busy, and so I get to be a substitute for her temporarily. I feel honored and inferior. I hope I am capable and worthy of this. He wears a brown suit and is good-looking. He says on Monday night, we have to dress up. "A long dress?" I ask. He says, "Yes, black dress." I think, "I didn't pack anything pretty and formal." Then I decide that I did, but it's red. "Will a red dress do?" I ask. He pauses. A red dress in a sea of black dresses will be conspicuous, but he smiles and says, "Why not?" Then I wonder if I can do my hair so it will look good. Then I decide I can. So we travel and he sees that I am talented and more and more we become a team. I write and he writes and it all works well together. He gets on a bike and starts to go to an assignment up a hill. As I watch him, I think, "This is amazing. This all feels so real and yet it is just a dream." I experience how real it feels. He then stops and turns and dashes back to me as fast as he can go, swooshing in next to me, all excited because he's realized that I am wonderful and he loves me. He tells me this and we hug. Now he's in jeans and tee-shirt, has black hair, and black framed glasses. I am lying down and when he and I embrace, I feel a pain in the genital area. He says he put cardboard there so he'd look and feel like he had a bigger penis. As we hug, I feel so happy to be connected with him and then I say, "I'll probably wake up hugging a pillow. This is after all, just a dream." He starts shaking and I say, "Shock. It's shock, adrenaline." I pat his leg reassuringly and wait. He moves away and lays on the edge of the couch back on his belly and shakes. I wait. Then Toni comes in with the baby. She has bathed it and it is crying. I say, "Here, let me hold it." I pick it up and hold the naked baby in its blanket. It calms down. Ginny is seated on another couch looking at some of my plants. The color looks yellow on one of them. Toni comes over and picks one plant up, pulling it out by the roots. Ginny is shocked and says, "No, don't do that." Toni says, "It's ok. This is a plant my sister gave me. Its different." She moves it through the air across the top of the planter and magic dust comes out of it and then a bunch of white daisies spring up and they are quite beautiful. I am interested in watching this.

I feel strong violation. Willie and Nate have raped me. I feel sad when I see Abner and then with difficulty remember that he didn't do the raping. I am relieved because I like him. A Robin Williams kind of man is very gentle and nice. I am afraid of him but I also want his affection. I like him. I see the pictures of two small girls (maybe 4 or 5 years old) looking very sweet and innocently sexy. I feel strong sadness and anger that these children were molested by the rapers. (94 words)

I am looking for an office where I'm supposed to give a speech or presentation for VR counselors. I neglected to write the information down but I have the address memorized. Between 2nd and B I find the place I thought it was, but it is a store. I look and look, going around the corner to where the street logically should be, but I can't find it. I try and try. Now I am concerned because I didn't write down the name or phone number of the woman contact that can tell me where I need to go. I feel foolish. I remember an old office and go there, driving. I find it an old University VR office and ask a man there. He figures it out and tells me they have moved their offices from where I was. So now I go and find the group. I am late, but I cleverly use my experience and relate it in a humorous way to teach them the steps they need to take. They are amused with my cleverness and impressed. (181 words)

"Men are immature and have plastic hearts." I finally find the VR place I'm supposed to be at and I am waiting. I see a line of magazines that people can take free copies of. I am amazed you can have Life magazines for free. They are very oversized. I see a magazine with a picture of Diane B on it and another one with Ellie. I realize these are my articles that I wrote. I want to see them. Diane is there looking over my shoulder. I see they printed my name exactly as I sent it, with errors and not in very large print. I realize I should have taken more care in the finishing details. What you see is what you get, I guess. I go look at a Life magazine. The front cover is moving pictures that look real. It's a bunch of tiny newborn male monkeys that are translucent, they are so new. The headline says, "UGH." The article is about how immature males are and we now have clinical proof with these monkeys. They lack a female hormone so they don't mature till much later than females. I think, "Huh, that explains why they act so immature." I go through a series of rooms, looking for someone, maybe my wife because now I'm Howard. He/I are sort of hiding from some authorities, perhaps medical or military. He/I goes up a circular tube cloth thing and squeeze through the small opening at the top. Now we are hidden in the second story area. But now the authorities are gone so he/I squeeze through and go down, in a hurry before someone thinks this tube is empty and uses it. He/I goes from room to room looking for my wife. We find her. There is some picture, maybe in a magazine, of a red plastic heart. It may be an advertisement. There is a son, a small boy. (322 words)

I am tired. I just did two days of speaking at a conference. I am Oprah Winfrey. I go to the hotel room, which is quite expensive. My husband and I are supposed to leave this hotel and go to a cheaper one, but I am so tired that we decide to stay another night here. All I want is to swim in the pool and watch a little TV and sleep. My husband is very supportive. I go to the window and call out encouragement for the women's volleyball team. I am now a helper of Oprah and do an interview for her so she can rest. Now it's time to leave and I'm late and missed the bus, so there's a car load of Boy Scouts who have room for one more. It's a tight squeeze to get my wheelchair folded up in the back, and then I squeeze into the back seat with the boys. I notice that the driver is also in the back seat, with steering wheel and buttons there. I look in the front where there is also a steering wheel and lights and buttons that the boys are pretend driving with. It isn't functional though. We go and arrive at a house, possibly my parents'. I come in. The driver hands me a pie. I start to eat it - whipped cream and so on. My mother notices the meat chunks in the pie (like turkey or chicken hearts or gizzards) are not done yet, nearly raw. I remember the driver had not cooked it for very long, so she goes to cook it a bit more. My father is disappointed and leaves. Now I see a fan going to a room where Elvis is. He wants Elvis to autograph his orange. Elvis is rude, selfish, spoiled and arrogant. He pokes the pen into the orange and growls a few sarcastic words at the fan (male). I go in next and ask him to autograph my orange. Elvis would like to have an affair with me but I spurn him with some contempt. I tell him what I think of him. (358 words)

(nap) "Walking naked on another path and all spiritual people come from M City, it's the law." My parents and I are walking down a road, sort of a dirt road through a woods. They want to show me a bird. They get in a stream of water and walk in it. I am still on the road, with a fence between us. My mother slips and falls and sits underwater. I want to help her up but I'm held back by the fence. I wonder why my father isn't helping her. She's there a long time when my father finally helps her up. Now they are both naked and walking in the water. I see a broken gap in the wire fence and I wiggle through. I'm up on the embankment. They join me. I now am naked and a little curious to see my father naked, but embarrassed to look at his genital area. We come to the end of this path at a cliff and my father crawls up to get the bird to show me. I say that it's a new law now that all spiritual people must come from M City (India) and isn't that silly? Lots of good people don't come from there. We are now all walking back and I go through the fence to the dirt road. A man is coming toward me to talk with me. My father is urgently reminding me to put my dress back on! I do so quickly and the man looks at me and comments on how refreshed and cool I look. I notice he is hot and sweaty. I am still cool from the lovely walk in the water. (284 words)

"Aliens play rough." A man and a woman are in a space ship coming back to earth. But the door pops open and the lock won't hold and the woman says, "Thank goodness you are already malfunctioning (perhaps dead) and can't breathe or this could have been fatal." He agrees and struggles to get the latch to hold. She suggests they have tea and starts to go to the "kitchen," when they notice the furniture is all floating around. This is bad news because soon they are going into earth orbit, and as soon as they hit gravity they could be killed by all the heavy, falling furniture. He grabs for big lamps and things and is trying to secure them down. Just then a green pickup truck smashes into the plate glass window and breaks it. An alien dressed as a deer hunter gets out and says cheerfully, "You caused me enough trouble; now my lions are going to get you." The man/me tries to explain this isn't OK (not a good time). He didn't mean to cause trouble and this is all too much. The man's left arm hangs useless. It's hurt (like the bus driver last night), but the alien doesn't believe him. So the lion attacks and the man fights with a metal hook thing with his one arm. It's a touch and go battle but finally the man whams the lion on the head enough times to nearly kill it. The lion's plastic white eyelids shut so we know he's near death. Once more the hook hits (like Lacrosse or racquet ball) and hooks him in his throat. He dies. The alien is impressed. Now the man explains his predicament: the door is open, the window broken, the heavy furniture floating and soon he'll hit orbit. The alien apologizes and agrees to help. The alien says, "I only meant to entertain you. I thought you were out here for a long trip and needed something to break the boredom. I know what that's like! I didn't realize you were only here for a couple of weeks." He helps fix things, then the man goes to the kitchen and requests the woman eat/smoke/drink particular things so he can enjoy that flavor. She is happy to comply and requests from him her particular flavor. (387 words)

I am a fan and Elvis is bored. He's way up high on a stage singing and I am way on the floor listening. After he's through singing, his manager or someone whisks him away from the crowd. I get caught up in that and it is decided I can keep him company. We go to a room and Elvis says, "Sit here." I thought he meant on his lap. But he was indicating the chair across from him. I sit and talk like an empathetic counselor, "You look tired." (90 words)

I feel quite proud that I choose not to join my well wishers in a fun party, but go right on with my work. I am questioned at the library why I've parked my wheelchair in this one spot.

I am going somewhere in my wheelchair and I am going through other people's houses. I enter the back door, drive through the rooms and go out the front door. In the last house, a boy sees me and is angry. "What are you doing in my house?" he asks. I feel embarrassed. I don't know why I did this. I assure him I'm just passing through. I am not stealing things. He then relaxes. I go out and notice the house so I can return. It is made of cement block and white wrought iron trim. It's kind of ugly and I am surprised because the inside looked sort of ritzy. I see the numbers 5555 on the house and check the street signs. It's back a ways near the corner of 7th street and 11th street. I go on after double checking where it is so I'll remember. (150 words)

I did research on a board game and played it myself to understand it. It involves movie stars. I now am sharing the game with a group of friends: Hillary of Merton Circle, Bob M of Counseling and two other women. I look up to the ceiling and see four large glass or ceramic things we'd somehow secured up there. One is a large cat ceramic (like the one on my fireplace). Another is a dog one, like a cookie jar. One is a huge red glass bowl with ornate embossed patterns on it, very Victorian and beautiful. I notice it's crooked and may fall. I am concerned because we are seated right under it. In the game, there is a MaMa card and a Doctor card. There are four categories to choose from. One is a picture of a young girl (7-8 years old) fleeing from a woman, perhaps in Indian (eastern) dress or early 1900's dress. The theme is the girl was hurt very badly by her mother. I don't remember the other three categories. I see Ginger Rogers seated near the board. She is one of the women in the group, and I say, "You were my mother in a movie. I'm not surprised you don't remember, I had forgotten too." Now I'm having trouble remembering how to play the game and it is getting boring. I fold it up like an accordion credit card holder, wondering why I thought it was such a good game. [BL] (249 words)

I'm on stage with the same group from the last dream. We are doing a play and in the middle of it someone says, "Wait a minute, I have to go get something." She leaves the stage and we are left with a long pause. We begin to improvise to stall for time. The audience is seated behind a house wall instead of a curtain. I talk chit chat for a while and then I go downstage and play on a piano. I start with Beethoven's 5th and play the Flight of the Bumblebee and other things with huge, loud chords crashing around. I was splendid. I am surprised because I can't play the piano like this. I peek over the top of the upright piano and wiggle my eyebrows at the audience and they laugh. I continue to clown and play this wonderful music. Finally the woman returns and we continue with the play. Now it's after and the group each has some things in their corner and we are sharing with each other what we have (talking about the things). Bob M says, "I'll just count my money now," and ignores us like he's bored and will do something useful for awhile. I am annoyed at him because he's choosing to not be a part of our circle. Hillary and I lean on each other and feel the same way. I see a beautiful wooden carved tea chest with teas in it. I like it and suggest that we can choose to trade with one another if we liked what the other had better than what we had. This was agreeable with everyone. I traded for the tea chest, and opened the little drawers happily looking at the pretty colored packages of different teas. (296 words)

Howard and I are going for a drive in the woods in my van. He's tired. It's an eastern (state) forest road with all hills and dirt. I see a huge geode with beautiful crystals in it way up high in a tree on the right. I say, "Oh, look!" Howard missed it. I ask him to stop and turn around. He does. We are at the end of the road and driving among the trees. He turns and we go back. We look as we drive past and I say, "Let's go see if there are some small shards that have fallen where we can get some." He agrees and looks for a place to turn as the road we are back on is so narrow. I place my left hand back on the seat behind his head and I'm aware of his head touching my hand and realize it's quite pleasant to have gentle contact with him. He moves his head away like it annoyed him. I'm sorry the connection got broken. We stop at a very steep part of the road as he thinks about whether or not we'll tip over if we go down it. I offer to drive, but I don't want to. We go down and are OK and I see a space wide enough to turn in. I see two women walking on the road and we follow. Now we're walking and my knee hurts. Howard has a headache. We walk down lots of wooden steps and I think, "No wonder my knee hurts." The two women are ahead of us with other tourists. I see that Wayne K of the community college is ahead directing a musical group to sing. He's at a door and says, "I lead a band of swing." The women introduce themselves and I turn surprised to Howard who is now Dwight. I say, "Did she say Sanders?" She had. I go up to her and say, "I'm Sanders and this is my brother, Dwight Sanders." She says, "Are you related to the Carolina Sanders?" (There brother James is also there.) I say, "Yes," and I recite the family line from my Uncle Willis's book. I tell of Francis and Ohio and Virginia to Carolina and then coming from England as indentured servants and horse thieves. They are excited and one woman whispers a question. I can't hear it and ask her to repeat it three or four times and then she goes away. I feel frustrated and embarrassed that I couldn't hear it. (426 words)

I'm in a house. There are lots of rooms. I keep going from one to the other looking for what, I do not know. Howard's things are in a dresser (see illustration in original dream book). I can't find my writing. There are lots of beds, single beds; no place to really sleep. The little girl is upset. I take her hand. Someone knocks on the living room door. We go into the hall and into the living room. Several people have sick little people/animals. One "dog" is a tiny, naked man. He's also like a baby. Someone (woman) pulls out a worm from his nose. It grows and looks like a crawly white scorpion thing and I say, "Don't do that." They take out another one and I realize these things will grow and crawl around and get past them. "At least kill them if you are going to let them out," I say. A woman cuts them with a scissors. I feel they are being irresponsible and endangering me and the little girl. I look closely at the objects on the three pianos and realize they are just like the ones in my parents' house. I am agitated and take the girl and go back to find Howard. Down the hall I go. We pass a room where I see the little girl's exact duplicate, and am amazed. I go to my writing room, but it's crowded with things. I go back to the room where the duplicate girl is and hesitantly enter. A bed with a man in it is on the right. He looks at me and I apologize for going into his place. He smiles and welcomes me. "Dad," he calls and a man comes in from a door. He's very tall. I explain that I saw the duplicate girl and I don't know what to do because my house is full of things that aren't mine. The men are very sympathetic and smile because they had come here in just such an upset state with their little boy. They can help. (347 words)

I am in bed with a little girl. I get up and try to brush my hair and see huge bald pink spots on my head. I am appalled. I try to brush my hair to cover it up. It's a mess. Then I see my breasts and they have huge dark nipples and a deep purple rash under one breast. Then I notice the same rash under my knees. I am sick, thinking this is some awful disease. Then the purple starts disappearing like a skin color would when the pressure is off (like my ankle). I think to myself that I should spend more time looking at myself in the mirror. (113 words)

A nurse talks to my little girl and is going to show her some things in a glass cabinet like a counter in a store. It is against my wishes because she had wanted to, but I didn't want her to. As the nurse, like the goody two shoes she is, shows her things, the girl also steals things like I knew she would. The idealist nurse brings the girl back to me and I point out a list of items and one thing the girl has isn't on the list (or vice versa). Anyway, I deliberately squealed on the girl. The nurse is surprised. I say, "You took her from me because you felt I wasn't giving her enough experiences and you were right to some extent, but I knew she would steal you blind. She is manipulative. You didn't know that." The nurse leaves us and now a doctor watches me from a distance and then writes a soap opera based on things I do and say. It's quite popular and people laugh. I am unaware of all this until I see it. Now the doctor likes me and wants to marry me. My husband, Spencer Tracy, says to him, "So you just want me to move out, huh? Well, OK, as long as you leave a bridge so I came come back now and again and visit. It's probably better this way anyway," he says. "I would be better off living alone." The doctor asks him where he'll go. He says, "If I go to live alone with someone, the safest place would be Brazil, where there is lots of food." I see the jungles like I'm in a plane and then I see a dinosaur looking up at me. "And," he continues, "lots of food that can eat me." Or he may live in the tropics under a palm tree - no house, no clutter, no things. It sounds good. (324 words)

There is a school, perhaps a college, a man. Now I am the new college president. I am building my own college in the deserts of Central (state), near a small town of hicks, in beautiful landscapes of rust colored mountains covered at the top with clouds and in the shape of a cascade mountain, but no snow; rolling hills. I now inspect the campus starting with my office. It is a very pleasant place with windows and mirrors. I go down long halls where the rooms are on each side that I can't see into. They are still being built and are boarded up. I try to imagine what they will look like. It is too much work for the dream imagination to create the details. I come to a ramped sidewalk thing with side walls that are too skinny and keep squeezing me and I keep trying to force them to be more open and accommodating, and finally succeed. The motto of the school or philosophy is that "the process is more important than the knowledge." This is a new way of thinking. I must choose teachers who are open, flexible, honest and creative. Students can goof off, but they are tracked to a goof off track where teachers and counselors work with that energy to transform and "get it more on a productive track." I see Judith who is coming to be interviewed for the teaching job. I give her a packet of tests to take: Meyers Briggs, and some others that I derived from years of working with knowledge-based teachers, what not to be kinds of tests, or measurements. (273 words)

There's a room full of men who are mindlessly having sex with one another, sort of a sadistic kind of thing. One of them bites me on the ankle and the skin blows up like a transparent balloon and will explode if I'm not careful. I look to where they bite at the back of the ankle and see a dark purple fill up the skin and then the balloon rise of the transparent skin. This is supposedly very sexual, but I don't feel sexual excitement. (86 words)

I am at a beach with two other women and they point out Merle in his wheelchair and ask if he's tried to date me yet because he's been hitting on them. I feel sadness. I say, "Yes, he has, but, you know, I'm just not interested." I walk down a boardwalk to the beach, and somehow skin my knee. A lifeguard with white blonde hair puts a bandage around it and around my wrist. It is too loose and will come off so Michael has some tape and we are taping the gauze bandage down more tightly. Now I'm ready to play. The lifeguard watches me. My observer point of view is right behind his head. He watches and then walks toward me. Now the point of view is with me and I see a big dog approaching me. He/the lifeguard lays down next to me. I pet him and start to lay one leg up over his back and then change my mind because it could be considered sexual. The dog/lifeguard is intense. (175 words)

A woman who lost lots of weight and used to be Jean is in the house with me. We have jobs to do. I think it's like Grandma Mildred's house. A man is in charge. I talk with Jean and tell her I'm amazed at how changed she is. She says she did lots of counseling. I want to ask her if she is still seeing Blake. I wonder if he got divorced, since she said they are seeing each other. I think I'm a bit envious. (87 words)

I am giving a huge celebration party for my parents. They are 70 years old. I see my mother sitting sideways in a small motor boat with a child. She looks old. I am surprised she is there. She seems to be enjoying herself. The house is large. I go back in and show Bonnie how I've set up the rooms. I go downstairs and say, "This is the hardest room." A huge table is set up with a tablecloth but nothing else on it yet. My concern is that there will be too many relatives and I want them to all sit down together to eat. I show Bonnie two other areas where chairs have been set up for people to sit and converse comfortably. I see there are so many chairs that there's hardly room for the people, so I say to Bonnie, "Let's put up the folding chairs and make more room." She and I do that. Now Aunt Naomi is there and Aunt Rosalie and some cousins. We great them. I see some cousins sitting in an adjourning area and see their small newborn baby. I think it's sweet and I go in to get a closer look. I then see another cousin holding a squirrel and I pick it up instead of the baby. It has a large black dog-like nose. Now I give it back and go to the stairs. Everyone is going upstairs. I try to walk up the stairs, but halfway up I am stopped because the step is huge. I have to stick my right foot way up on the banister and try and hoist myself up. I can't do it and I say to Bonnie, "I'll meet you up there, I'll go find another way." I see another door and walk toward it. I see a ramp leading outdoors and see a dog turd on it. I go outside to go around to the front door and back in. Dwight is there somewhere. (333 words)

I and two men are in a large house. We've been up all night writing. Taking turns writing in a computer in a small room that looks out over the ocean. I am distracted from writing when I glance out the window and see how very blue the water is and I think I see a seal. But it is two black dogs sitting in a shrub tree. Then I see penguins and gulls all over. I realize it is the rocky surf and not yet the ocean I am looking at. The ocean is much further out. It is low tide. I then realize I'll never get my writing done if I spend all my time gazing at my ocean. The one man and I are a team helping each other as we write and co-writing the thing. There is a good mutual admiration society going on. [BL] (148 words)

I am shocked to realize that the nice girl who was babysitting the children for only an hour ate the children. She is also an alien, with eyes that look like tennis balls. She changes into that shape all of a sudden terrifying me and she roars an awful sound. If you are touched by her, you turn into one too. I am now taking care of a woman who sits meekly in a rocking chair. Suddenly, as I am leaning over her to help her, I drool and grin and the alien head pops on and I roar. Now I am trapped and must stay in the small cabin. I try to lock the doors to keep people out. I don't know who is alien and who isn't. I realize I must kill myself and so must the other woman to save everyone else. I don't want to die but I must. There is no other way. A woman named Mary stands outside calling to me. She says "See, you don't have to kill yourself. I was an alien and now I'm OK." I don't quite believe her and hesitate. What should I do? (195 words)

I decide to take Abner's baby for a few hours. I don't tell him. It ends up I kept the baby overnight and now I feel guilty because I never called Abner to let him know and he must be worried. I worry he'll really be mad at me when he gets the baby. I am standing in the middle of a huge grocery store looking for some food to give the baby. I see packages of baloney, cheese and so on. I choose to feed her cheese and crackers. Then I remember she eats cereal and milk and decide to find some for her. (105 words)

I am driving down the coast highway in my wheelchair and suddenly have trouble going because the joy stick has snapped off. I try to put it back on but it keeps falling off. I go to a store and see a man in there and ask him if he can fix it. I am in N City. Later I see my father and he says he's going into town. I say, "Well, if it's not too far for you, why not walk the five miles with me? Good exercise for you." He agrees and I feel good we will have this time together. Then someone drives up and says to my father, "Hop in, we'll give you a ride," and he does, completely forgetting me. I feel hurt and abandoned. I then suggest to them (my mother and brothers and my father) that if we all went in my van, I could join them. They agree, feeling a little bad they didn't think of it before. Then my mother shows me a present she got me. I unzip the package and see two cute jackets for a child, size 4. They are vest-like jackets in a pretty green plaid. There are words knitted into the waist band, something about enjoying the outdoors and river rafting. Someone says that they'll exchange the clothes for some my adult size since I've decided to like the emerald green color (like I've matured somehow and accepted the goodness of that color and allowed myself to wear this color).

"Interpreting the dream in the dream." Mary and I are deciding to jump in the river. It looks pretty awesome with huge waves and white water, but we do it anyway. It is potentially dangerous and we dive in and swim frantically, but not afraid. After a while, we see a pasture and farm buildings on the left bank. The fence is open and we swim over and get on land, deciding that this might be the prudent thing to do as we don't know how much worse the river will get around the bend. We walk toward the buildings and on my left I see lots of objects lined up and I think excitedly, "How interesting, dream symbols." I wonder what they mean and I try to look at each one and remember what was there so I can write them down [I don't remember now what they were]. Then we see a big blackboard. We're visiting a classroom which is in this huge pasture area. On the blackboard the words, "The vertical cannot be seen until the horizontal is understood" are written and then I see drawn pictures of furniture where I can see the vertical lines and barely make out the horizontal ones. I am very impressed at the message from my dream and feel a moment of great insight. Now we are observing the class. I see a young boy and say, "I'll bet I can guess your age." I'm about to guess 5th grade when he says, "High school." I tell him I used to be a 3rd grade teacher and was glad I didn't show up my ignorance by guessing his age. I see some boys resting on mats on the floor for nap time. I place an object by one boy. I think I am returning it to him after looking at it. Then I share a couch with a girl. I curl up on it. There's not much room for me. I watch as the 3rd grade teacher, male, takes my daughter Dovre outside to play flute and music. The class is well behaved, everyone doing what they are supposed to be doing. Some of them look out the window at Dovre and the teacher. The teacher comes in with his face in a frown and a toothpick in his mouth. Someone comments that he's mad and you can tell because of the way his mouth is closed around the toothpick. He is annoyed with the students and I am surprised because I thought them well behaved. He didn't, however, and reprimands them to get back to what they are supposed to be doing. (436 words)

I am in a house. Judy and Bill are there. I am packing up my things to leave. I pack books. I decide to take my broken laser printer and broken computer games also, rather than leave them and Grandma Mildred trying to use them. She would only get confused or frustrated. I'm leaving earlier than I expected. I'm not sure why I'm leaving now. Grandma is upset that I am going. Now I'm in the back seat of a car with Judy. Bill is in the front seat, driving. I realize that in my haste to leave, I left behind my pills and some clothes and so on that I will need in the morning. I apologize and say, "I guess we'll have to go back." Bill is annoyed. I explain to Judy that if we don't go back now, then we'll waste much more time because if we wait until we get to our destination, we'd have to turn around anyway and go the whole distance back. They agree, annoyed. We return and walk into the house. Grandma Mildred sees me and is very angry. She walks upstairs and lies on her bed, deliberately not speaking or looking at me. I sigh and go to get my things. I leave and now I am alone in an office building. There are two men, doctors, and I am applying for a job. They are explaining that they do research and autopsies. I would be assisting them in the autopsy. Inwardly I'm thinking that I could never do this; it would make me sick. But outwardly I'm listening and nodding like of course I can do this. Then one says, "Oh, we have to do an emergency one now. You'll have to help." I feel scared. The one doctor says, "I'll perform the actual autopsy and this doctor will be my scrub nurse, since she has already gone home. You will do the receptionist and gofer work. OK?" I agree, wondering if I can actually do it without fainting or getting sick. I see a body under a sheet. (349 words)

Something about being in the M City house and seated on the living room couch and then I am seated in a old-fashioned school desk made for two with a good-looking young man with salt and pepper gray hair. He and I are very lovey. It feels wonderful to be close to him and touch his hair and flirt. He is Alfred Hitchcock's son. We laugh at the funniness that would be if I were fat and he were skinny (beings as how Hitchcock was fat). (86 words)

I receive a large package and I am intrigued about who could have sent it. It is filled with lots of little packages and notes on each one and I have to be careful not to rip any envelopes open because there are notes all over it. I carefully read it and exclaim, "Oh, this is from Robert Price, the man I met in Alaska." We were at a party or festival at the end of school finals and met just at the end of it before I had to catch a train home. We were very drawn to one another, but the timing was wrong and I had to leave. He had talked about a place in Alaska where we could get together, like a resort, and enjoy each other's company in a restful atmosphere. In the package are fishing rods and I laugh because I don't fish and I remember the negative stuff around Howard giving me a left-handed fishing reel. I am not offended, however, but pleased. I see little lures and fly tackle and stuff and I say to Ginny, "Look, he's courting me." She asks what I'm going to do about it. I say, "Well, even if it doesn't work out, I'll always have this wonderful moment. At least someone is courting me." I am going to meet him in Alaska and give it a try. (231 words)

Tom Cruise is driving a car. His girlfriend is in the passenger side and I am in the back, between them, leaning over the front seat to talk with them. I see Tom copy some words off a paper and he wads it up and throws it away. I see it is a FIRO-B test form and I start to tell him all about how I was a counselor at the community college and gave that test which was developed by (I couldn't remember his name), that California Pop Psychology guy, oh, yeah, Will Schultz. I then say, "I gave that test to all my family members and they sure didn't like that." I laugh. Then I see we are going across a huge river. The water level is right up to the edge of the road and a long, black, snaky hose thing is floating in the river. Now we go up on the bridge, which arches up high, and I see that the road is also water and we hit something submerged in the water. I look and see a tip of an iceberg shaped like a volcano. I say, "Oh, look, there are those ice cubes, no, ice bergs." We slow down and hit a few more as we go. (213 words)

I am training a group of people and we are doing a bike race. I notice the roads are covered with ice and snow and it is slick. I am worried I won't be able to keep up with the students and feel inadequate. We are going to go across a bridge to Canada. But I'm told the bike lane is closed and we have to bike on the freeway part with the cars. I feel concerned. That is too dangerous. (81 words)

I'm in a line with my daughter Paulina. Then, I am the playwrighting class teacher, helping Jock teach the class. I've read the contest play entries and come into the classroom. No one is there. Jock is sick and the students haven't come in yet. I see Richard and we talk. I am attracted to him and he is sort of to me. I am aware he's younger. Now there is a bed in the room and I sit on it and Richard flirts and we hold hands and roll around playfully. There is some witty repartee as we "dance" with a push-pull feeling - like him or not like him, that is the question. My brother Dwight comes in and I try to introduce him to Richard and three other students that had come in late. I can't remember his name and call him Jackie and he corrects me and says Johnny. He's a bit annoyed with me. He gives me two cans of soda and his business card. I see on the card he makes wood toys and a woman says, "Oh, do you carve them with his knife or your dick?" He's leaving and retorts, "You tell me, girl." He's out the door and I wisecrack, "What a cutting remark," and laugh. He laughs and is gone. I feel a little badly that my sarcasm could be taken hurtfully (a cutting remark). A student named Nate wasn't going to be in today because his wife or girlfriend was knifed, but he shows up. I want to ask him how his girlfriend is doing, but so much is happening all at once. (274 words)

I see a baby girl wearing a sweater, and Howard is around and I get concerned and want the baby to change and not wear a revealing sweater so someone won't get the idea of playing with her breasts. A woman tells me I'm being silly and jumping to conclusions. I realize she's right. Now I'm somewhere and want some information. I've been invited to go to Africa and at first don't want to, too much energy and trouble, but then I realize this is a great opportunity and want to go, even though it means risk. Howard goes up to a man to ask a question for me. I know I should do it myself but I let him. The man grins and grabs Howard and hugs him in a New Age enlightened syrupy way and Howard sends me a speaking glance because this makes him feel silly. I laugh because it's so silly to see him standing there. It's a shared moment. I am eating a hard boiled egg and think, "Now I'll have to share this with him," and then I want to share it with him, he's been so helpful. (194 words)

I am asleep on a chair recliner thing and some man, perhaps Ernie, but there is a feeling of Dwight also, stands watching me sleep. I can feel his sweet love. It's very universal, like deep friends. I wake and realize I haven't taken my pills this day and it's nearly evening, so Ginny brings me a pill and I say, "I want to take all the ones I normally take." I sort through white ones and pink ones and yellow ones. I set aside the yellow ones. Now we are at a conference of some kind in a house. I had wanted to create or host this conference and Ernie chose to use his house and organize it for me because I wanted it. I feel very happy and grateful. He does an excellent job. An older woman and her nerdy son sit on a couch and a man drones on in a boring way. Finally after they leave, Ernie is cleaning up and chuckles at how this man is so narrow-minded and only spouted off in one subject. I am helping cleanup and I'm holding a baggie full of pot roast or stew. I am squeezing the watery grease from a hole in the bag into a plate. I have to be very careful because the plate fills up fast and will overflow. As I do this, Ernie laughs and says, "He even managed to talk about 'A Horse Sex' from a Christian point of view." That was the name of a book the man was talking about. I see a book about Robinson Caruso or someone like that and comment that the woman gave it to me. I have one just like it in my collection of books from my childhood. It was an old favorite of mine. Now everyone at the conference is gone and I sit on a step with Ernie/Dwight and someone from our family - Ginny and Dwight? - bring a dozen roses and lay it a few feet near Ernie and we all applaud him like a standing ovation for his wonderful work. He smiles modestly. The applause is warm and loving. (360 words)

I am playing a guitar with Rolling Stones, sort of an audience member asked up, and I surprise them by being very good. Now they will let me be a member of the band. We go to the trailer that we travel in to sleep. There are three bedrooms but many band members, so I must share the bedroom with Mick Jagger. There are three beds and he sleeps in one and I the other. As I sleep, he gets up and stands next to my bed, looking at me. He likes me. It is gentle. Then he gets in bed with me. I wake up and am upset. I "knew" he'd try something. But he doesn't try anything. He just watches me. (123 words)

My "sister" and I are told to clean up the outside deck, which is quite large, like a dock area on a lake. It is next to a large body of water. So I have a broom and my area is around the lake edge, but I am haphazardly doing it, missing places and slowing down. My sister is working hard. I realize that I have left great clumps of dirt and lots of little dust, so I go back, realizing "better late than never" and try to clean it all up. We finally get it all done. I see a stairway down to a cabin where "Barb, or Pricilla or Cinderella" lives. She's a nice lady. We go to say hi. She gives me a haircut. We come back up to the dock area, hanging up the broom, and now the dock is covered almost knee deep in water. It's a bit difficult to see where to step, so we are careful and a little nervous. I didn't remember so much water before. Grandfather calls from the cabin and he doesn't approve of my haircut. I hand him a note from the lady saying he probably won't like it, but she hopes he forgives her and can see how nice it is. A small note from Maggie (disabled) is handwritten in blue ink. She says she's doing fine and is still going to school at M&A (Math and Arts). I know that means she's taking one class in math. "Big deal," I think. (254 words)

I am at an abbey for a conference and somehow I leave the lecture feeling picked on and sad. My time there is spoiled, so they owe me an extra day and night's lodging there to make up for it. I walk down several flights of stairs and see books lying under the stairs, books about babies and children. I want to pick them up, but keep going. Now there is a long hall with doors opened to rooms on both sides. I look to one on the right and see a little girl baby in a pink sleeper smiling at me. Her woman caregiver holds her up. I enter the room reserved for visitors of the abbey. Other women are there; so is a priest. I think he's attractive and am aware he's a priest. He gives me a book. He gives each of us the book he considers appropriate for us to walk around the room with. I see the title. It is "To Be A Star" [I typed start twice instead of star]. I feel a bit uppity and think, "Of course he would give me this book. How appropriate." Then I look more closely and see it is a book about Jesus. I suddenly feel humbled and very sad. I feel like crying, like grieving. I walk the room holding this book and wondering if I can handle this huge responsibility. Now I sit at a table. The priest is there and several other women. I take off my suit jacket, and think, "This won't do any good because he's a priest." I notice my frilly, ruffly blouse. I sit. (268 words)

I'm on a train-like thing and going to a writer's contest or something. I sit next to my "teacher" a short, pudgy guy in a brown sweater (sort of like Marshall Peters). He loves me and I feel warm about him, but won't admit it. We talk about my writing. I am flip and confident; I did well. He questions me. I see a man like Dennis of writing class. He's furiously writing. I put my head suddenly on the teacher's shoulder and say, "I guess I'll take a nap." He likes that I nestle there, but he's agitated because he wants to confess his love and doesn't have confidence. He says something and I look up and we kiss, hesitantly. We smile. The deed is done. We understand that we love each other. Another young man says, "Maybe you should be working on your writing." I shrug. The young man reads a sentence from Dennis' work and I realize I had misjudged him. He can write well; I thought he was just a kook. The teacher and I decide to get on this futuristic train-like thing that goes very fast to go get my script and read it closely to see if I need to rewrite. We sit in the leaned back seats and feel the immense pressure of takeoff and the pressure of the speed. Will we survive it? Yes. (232 words)

I am in a sort of house/hotel and sharing a bedroom with a girl child and Darryl. My parents' room is down the hall. Darryl is in bed with me. I want to hug him and I do so. There is hesitancy in both of us. Then he says, "I want to make love to you." It's OK now. I am glad and start to kiss him. I wonder if I should insist upon a rubber in case of AIDS. He gets up to go to the bathroom before we start making love. He returns and I go next. I go to the bathroom, saying to myself, "It's OK, I'm really awake and can pee." I then decide to brush my teeth a bit to get rid of bad breath. I choose not to put fresh toothpaste on the brush and do a complete job because I'd taste too much of toothpaste, so I brush with what was left on the brush. Then, I'm trying to wash a spot off my face, but the soap is making larger and more abundant spots. I think, "That is odd." I then go back into the bedroom. He is seated on the edge of the bed and I kneel in front of him, hugging him and kissing him repeatedly on his face. He says I'm cold and distant. I am a bit angry and say it's him that has always been cold and distant. I worry about the little girl and hope she's asleep. I get up to go out and get my camera and now Darryl and I are in a car. Nobody's really driving. It's like a bus I guess. I look up and see a line of people holding on to each other and stretching across the empty air from one tall building across the street to another tall building and I'm amazed at the skill to do that. It must be the way they hold their arms with each other that makes it work. I see several lines do that. I am excited about the visual interest and grab my camera and try to take pictures. It's very pretty. We go back to the room and I somehow have realized that Darryl has spent the last twenty years being a prostitute and he never told me and never even considered using a rubber to protect me from AIDS. And if we had made love, I'd have put myself in jeopardy. I am angry. He coolly denies it. Now there are lots of people in the room and I take my things and leave the room to them. I walk out down the hall and I'm in a large lobby room or something and a boy has been tied up and hung up by his feet on some blobby thing, and I realized the bad guys were going to harm him. I go to the rescue and fight off several people by poking them. They retreat fairly easily. (498 words)

I go to a man's house for a meeting of people with computers. It is very late at night when we get done. I say, "It will be hard to pack all my equipment into my house when I get home and I don't want to leave it in the car all night. It will freeze." I see snow on my computer keys. The old man says, concerned, "You don't have anyone to help you?" I say, "No." A young man who likes me helps pack it up for me. I get a pile of clothes and look through it and find some outfits for my little girl, who is tired and cranky. We start to walk home and the streets are wide with double lanes and it is daylight, even though it is very late at night. A few cars drive by. We turn a corner to the right and the little black girl whines and cries and lays down. I have to pull her along by her arm and apologize to her, saying, "We have to make it home. Please cooperate." We find the apartment, walk down a stairs and go in. Supposedly this is sort of in the slums and dangerous, but the place looks fine. When I get in, I see the man has already brought my computer and set it up. I put the clothes on a table and take the girl to her bed, asking her if she wants a drink of water. She whines and then goes to sleep immediately. I feel tired too. (261 words)

I am a cowboy and must help save my buddy held captive in a barn. I sneak up on the barn and make noises so they will come out and chase me and two other men. They ride away in another direction, leading the bad men after them and I circle around and sneak up again on the barn. I see a wad of money stuck in the barn wall and more is handed to me by somebody riding on a horse. I yell and maybe throw some money at the ones in the barn and they come after me. I ride fast and they follow, shooting, and I lean frontward over the horse, trying not to get shot. I am worried because they are catching up and I'll die. I see a train and I yell, "Is this the St. Louis car?" Someone says no and finally after several tries, I grab the last car and crawl up into it. Someone says, "That's the St. Louis car," and I say, "Yes, that's what I've been waiting for," or "Good, this is what I want." I met someone and they were from St. Louis and I loved them and now I'm going to go find them. (206 words)

I am living at home with my parents in M City. I have three cars and someone delivers some oil. It squirts out of the hose and leaks all over as it fills a tank outside the house. I feel better having it full now. I get in my red car with a floor stick shift and start to drive. I turn the corner to the left and squeal out, liking the good way the car is running. I feel pleased that I have three running cars now and Howard doesn't have as much. I feel a bit sorry for him, and as I drive I realize he wants to talk to me and wonder what it's about. I am feeling a bit superior about being better off than Howard. Then I remember I still live with my parents and feel embarrassed because I should at this age be out on my own. Even though I need someone to live in and help me, I could do that with a roommate. That would be more adult than relying on my parents. [BL] (181 words)

I look up and the baby girl has gone off to talk to some people. I feel tired, but it is my duty to teach her the more disciplined way of not barging in other people's conversations. I go get her and bring her back. She is not happy about that. Soon I see that she has gone again and I get up and retrieve her again. I feel tired, but know this is the only way to assist her to get along better with others. Later, we are in our apartment. I am in a dining area and a big living room adjoins it. There is also a bedroom space where my bed is and another open space where her bed is. I walk into the bedroom area and see it's really a barn. There is a layer of hay on the floor and the whole end wall is missing and open to the outdoors. I am surprised and repeat to myself, "I live in a barn." I go back to the dining area and then feel danger. I know the elevator is going to crash through the ceiling. At first I think it is the girl that lives above us dancing too much or something. I look up and see a square and then it opens up and an open elevator crashes through with two people on it, one a boy and the other a huge fat woman. It smashes the couch and I am relieved to know I or the little girl wasn't sitting there or we'd have been smashed. [BL] (263 words)

I am napping and try to wake up because I remember I've been sleeping all day and haven't changed the diaper of the baby. She's been laying in a crib all day waiting for me to wake up. Then I become aware that I am sleeping in a crib and Abner comes in and sees me asleep and puts a blanket over me. I try to tell him not to, that I am trying to wake up and get up now, but I can't wake up because I'm in such a heavy sleep. (93 words)

I am running for my life from the bad guys. We make it to a no man's land. One woman and two of the little girls make it across, and myself and a young boy don't make it. Two families have been split up. We are black. I feel sadness that I am split from my little girl, but relieved that I still have my boy. Now the bad guy is a nurse and I am a patient, in a hospital bed. She is mixing a nasty, poisonous, brown concoction that looks like liquid shit. She is going to kill me. My boy, dressed like an orderly with a mask over his mouth, comes in as the nurse goes into the bathroom to wash off the poison from her hands. He makes himself known to me and tells me where the poison is and not to drink it. So I am to refuse the big pills and he will spill the brown liquid. I insist on taking my usual pills, the cortisone and hormones, and they get stuck in my throat because I take them all at once. The boy tells a woman to get the tomato juice ready and warns me not to try this. I am stubborn. Even though he tells me I might have to drink the poison to get the pills down, I swallow and swallow and they get stuck and I drink the juice and get them down. The other woman is Gracie Allen and she says "Well, George, I guess I'll have to buy her a drink after we get out of here." I smile. The boy spills the brown stuff after I pretend to drink some. We have foiled the bad guys. (289 words)

I am in the front row of a huge audience in a big gym for a rock concert. I am in a manual wheelchair. There are some other disabled people in the audience but mostly they are ab's. There is a large empty floor space between the first row of audience and the stage. On the stage is a group of men playing rock music. One is particularly attractive. He says he will kiss one of the disabled people. I go up quickly to the edge of the stage and he comes down on the floor and picks me up in a lavish body dancing dip posture and exaggerates a kiss. I play along dramatically. As we finally kiss, I realize he is wearing a wooden mask with a small hole for the mouth and he "tongues" me through the hole. He whispers his apology and says that later we will really kiss. I feel frustrated, but try my best to kiss real good. Our tongues touch. I go back to my seat. Now the group resets up their stage setting on the floor right in front of me. They have a play they will do and create fold-out sets and costumes in a wardrobe, within a foot of where I sit. I am excited I will get to see things so close. He asks how many disabled there are in the audience. They yell or raise their hands. There are a few. I change to my power wheelchair to dance with him. [BL] (253 words)

My floors are bare of carpets. They are wooden and cold to walk on barefooted. There is a delivery of logs and I move far away so I don't get crushed by them. When I come back to see what I got, I am ashamed to see they are only a pile of stacked shingles for a roof. Someone says there is no shame in this, but I feel embarrassed. (70 words)

I own a hotel and there is a conference being held there today. I get dressed in a pretty dress and walk out to greet the people, timing it carefully to come out just when the good-looking man comes in. I miss it a bit and try again. The women come in and I give them the keys to their complementary resting rooms and try to connect with the man. He is allusive. I suggest I show him his room; he can use mine. I take him to the elevator. He turns and walks away. I turn and push number 4 and the elevator opens. It is tiny and crowded with a wheelbarrow with a small girl in it and a metal container that smells very metallic. I get in, resigned, and go up to my room. [BL] (137 words)

Jock and his wife Melinda and children are at their home and I am visiting them on Christmas. Jock sits very close to me and I can tell he loves me. I feel embarrassed because his family is there and they are being so nice, and I like his wife as a friend and their baby girl is very sweet. The children (two teen boys) bring me gifts. They had taken a few of their own things and wrapped them up for me. I am very touched. I don't open them because I'm not sure they really meant to give them to me. I sit on a couch. The wife (dark hair) is concerned about her baby girl and I talk with her. I want to help with the girl. Then Jock is sitting next to me and he leans over and kisses me. I try to pull back, but he just keeps leaning into me and forcing the kiss. The kiss isn't even very pleasant. I resist and finally pull away enough to speak. He says, "You don't care like I do." I say, "Well, after all, your family is here." The kiss felt heavy and ponderous. I feel caught between a rock and a hard place. His two sons then come up to us and hand me the gifts. I thank them and open one. It is a beautiful, expensive hard cover book on Native Americans, with beautiful color pictures and an object of Native American origin in the book. Jock is annoyed with his son because that cost Jock lots of money to buy for his son and now the son gives it away on a whim. "Why bother to do something nice?" he mutters, meaning his gesture to his son. I feel overwhelmed and caught in the middle. (302 words)

I am visiting in England and walking a boardwalk, looking for a place where English people are. I like to hear their accents. I get off the boardwalk because it feels rickety and walk on the dirt street. I walk up a couple of steps to the entrance to a series of cafes and shops. A woman is there and I speak and she's delighted because I'm an American. We talk and she invites me into a cafe to talk. I say, "I want to find the ocean." I look through a curtained window and think I see some waves, but it turns out to be a sort of waterfall cascading harmlessly on some rocks. I look further and far out past the marsh are some waves, the ocean. I go out and try to get closer and walk over to sit on a rock to see the ocean. Meanwhile a man sees me and falls in love with me, but he realizes I'm in danger and rushes out, yelling, "Get off the rock at once. Run here." I hear his scared tone and don't know why he's scared, but I obey, and as I run, huge waves of the ocean rush toward me and the rock and I narrowly escape being sucked out to sea by the tremendous backwash or riptide. I climb up the rocky bank and join the man. He and I stand very close together, me trying to get him to kiss me and him resisting in a shy, pure way. We walk to my room. I change clothes as he waits outside and he knocks on the door. I step out, all pretty in pink dress and heels (1950) and stand as close to him as I can. The pressure's on. He has a hard time resisting my charms, but his gentlemanliness wins out over desire. We go to tea. (315 words)

I am on an airplane sitting near the back. Mary, ex-roommate, sits near me. We are observing a man up front that says it's OK to throw people off the plane if they annoy you. He opens the door and tosses someone out. Mary and I look at each other, a bit concerned. Now the plane is gone and we are traveling low to the river. I am seated on a four legged high bar stool kind of thing and wearing a pretty dress. Howard and another man are seated behind us and everywhere we look fish are jumping or swimming and Howard really wants to fish. It's driving him crazy to be so close to it and not be able to do it. A fish jumps into my skirt and I laugh and say I'll net them. We travel on. Now the river is a road and we stop (we are not in a car, but travel like we are). I see the railroad signal and say, "Stop, a train is coming." We stop and then I say, "Go on a few more feet," and we do, so we are between two sets of tracks. I then get concerned because what if I miscalculated and the train uses that space and we get squashed? But we are OK. Two sets of railroad cars come out of tunnels in front and behind us. One set of cars does not couple right as the train drives up to it and I watch, worried. It tries three or four times, and then finally the metal tongue of one car clicks into the slot of the other car. I am relieved. Now my girls are with me and we decide to shower. We all have our clothes on and I say, "I hope they dry fast." The stream of water from the shower head is thin and small. Dovre gets in front of me and a man, naked, is behind me, Howard or perhaps Tony (of dream group). He has a soft penis and wants to cuddle, spoon fashion. So the girls shower and he cuddles and then they all leave. And now I'm watching two young teen girls, one crying that she's very frustrated because she had been turned on and now there's nothing. What is she to do? There is a bulge near her pubic area like a scrotum sac. They stand near a river. (404 words)

A woman is dressed in a white dance leotard and is dancing on a black and white set. I am intrigued with the shadows on her face and body as she danced through dark and light. I try to explain to her that I know this is her dance, but I see it from a different perspective because she can't see the shadows she is dancing with. I think it is beautiful. She doesn't understand me and is annoyed that I try to impose my vision on her dance. I move on and see other performers. Reynold and I critique them and write our remarks on scraps of paper. I realize that they are good remarks and should be kept for inclusion in a book. I start to sign his with the name Kevin Tom (sort of a title like a high monk would have) and my name was to be Beneficent B, but that was too long to keep writing so I decided on Benign B. I start gathering up the papers to compile. Reynold comes in and asks me if I know of any good places to stay at in B Town. He's going to a conference. I think and come up with two or three. The first is a place near the University that used to be a fraternity or sorority and now is made into a bed and breakfast. You have to share a room with someone or you can get a single room for a bit more money. Reynold doesn't like the idea of a roommate. I tell him the rooms are lovely, carpeted and nice furniture, even though the beds are bunk beds and it is a dormitory style setup. Then I mention a hotel near town that is like the E City Hilton. I can't remember the names of either one and tell him I'll go look them up and tell him later. (320 words)

I am at Total Mobility to get my wheelchair fixed. They quote me $250. I agree and get out of the chair. I follow Merle into an elevator and he says I should stick with him or I will get lost. There are stairways and places I could take a wrong turn. He's walking, sort of, now too. We get to the top floor and see Bonnie, who is taking classes at the University where we are. She goes on her way. I now follow Merle to a stairwell, looking for the elevator, but can't find it. I end up in a room where a couple of workers are. They show me my wheelchair and I say, "Wait, where are my extenders?" (for the foot pedals, only I am looking for tip rods or extended brake levers). They have misplaced them and now sort of look around in confusion, not trying very hard. I get annoyed, and start walking around, looking for them. I see my old chair and start to take my things out of a fanny pack on the side arm. Then I want to take the fanny pack off too. I have trouble, so this guy comes up to help. I am now standing next to a good-looking man in his forties. He has beautiful blue eyes, wrinkles on his face and wears workman jeans. He stands close to me, smiling, and he tries to stand taller. He's a few inches taller than I am, which pleases me. I like a man that height. As we chit chat, he holds my hand and I smile like a teenager in love. We talk about wheelchair games and other wheelchair people and how good they are at athletics. Even when he needs to do some detail work, he holds my hand. I don't want to break the connection. The other co-workers are looking at us askance. They are surprised and grinning. Merle shows up again to lead me back. I reluctantly let go of Nathan's hand. We part and I follow Merle, aware of Nathan watching as I walk well, seeming not to need a wheelchair. There is no elevator, so Merle says, "Go this way, but be careful of swinging things that could hit your head." "What?" I exclaim, "...then I won't go that way." I try to see my way out but decide I'd try the other way instead. I look in and see he means a series of metal things in triangular shapes on a conveyor belt. There is steam there as well, and it is close to where I enter the door. I hesitate, watching, and then ducking in, holding my hand up to protect my face. After I'm in, I see there is no more danger and I walk to a stack of boxes I slide down like they are giant stairs. I'm pretty adept and agile and hope Nathan is watching. Merle is jealous. I ask Merle about Nathan, saying, "He seems like a nice guy." Merle mumbles something and I ask him to repeat it three or four times. I finally figure out he said, "Nathan has just joined the gay community." "Just my luck," I mutter, feeling ripped off. I find my chair among many others and ask for the bill. They say $450. "What?" I ask frustrated. They shrug and wait. I say, "You quoted me $250." They shuffle and look embarrassed. I am angry. They did it to me again; they snookered me in. I wait, feeling like a turd for insisting they give the tires at the price they quoted me. After all, they did so much work, but I'm feeling it is unfair to me. I hold my ground and they mumble, "OK, then give it to her for the quoted price." (635 words)

I am a boy and I'm running. Someone is after me and will hurt me. I and my smaller brother hop up on the canvas roof of a passing truck and hang on tight. The man sees us there. Now I see us on the roof and the driver is deliberately unloosing the canvas top. It slips loose and I fall off the moving truck, sort of like in slow motion, as I prepare to take the fall. I know it will hurt and maybe kill me. I hit the sidewalk and crumble up. I am a woman now and I lie there calling, "Someone call 911. I need a doctor." Several women rush up concerned and I ask them to call a doctor. They run around, unhelpful. Finally they come and take me to the hospital (the other boy was hanging on to the truck for dear life and may be hurt later). They put me on a table and the doctor comes in and the nurses, and they see me and say, "Her heart is deformed and too small. This will be trouble." I tell them they will also have trouble with my throat. A nurse points to my genitals and says they will be taken care of. Oh, before I get into the hospital I am being rushed down the sidewalk on a stretcher thing and I see Ginny and her "man" and I say to him, "I will never forgive you. I am very angry." He looks at her and she says, "I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole. I'll wait till she's awake." I wonder what she thought I meant. Now I wake up from the surgery. I am furious. and very injured. They've "fixed my genitals" by either cutting them out, or sewing them up; no fucking. I barely have a memory. It's a miracle I can even talk, and that with effort. Now there is a family dinner and I come to be seen by the relatives. My "father," a sort of mobster type, is grinning at me and saying, "Now what was it you were saying about incest? Didn't you say I was your first when you were a baby?" He went on to tell other secrets like they were lies I had made up. I sit there, nearly paralyzed and angry. I see the doctor in the operating room with all that equipment and the nurse comes in and says, "I had trouble with the Number 235. It was a small device that fit into a small hole." He nods.

I am driving at night and pull over on a sidewalk and park. I get in the back seat and rest, eating something, maybe a sandwich. After a while, I get nervous or I throw something into the front seat and then realize I need to go get it. I crawl over into the driver's side and realize the car motor is running and I left it on. I wonder why I did that and if sitting there that long with monoxide fumes was bad. Since I'm now in the front seat, I slip on my shoes and decide to drive back home. There is a line of parked bicycles in front of me and I look in the rear view mirror to see if any are behind me because I don't want to run over any. I start to back up. I now realize I'm on a side road next to a freeway, I can see the car headlights passing by. So I am backing up and have trouble seeing out the back mirrors. It's a narrow gravel road near a river and I hope I don't go over the edge into the river. At one pint I am turning and see I've gotten right to the edge and my motor dies. I grab the wheel and yank it back the way I'd been and narrowly escape going over the embankment. So I continue to back up, trying hard to see the road. The car is hard to stop and I use the brakes and barely keep it from going too fast. Now I'm going down hill. I use the brakes and it isn't enough, so I put it in reverse. It finally stops and I see I'm at a place where I can turn around and drive front ways. I do so. Now I'm on the freeway, but I'm on a bicycle. It's 2 or 3 in the morning and no one is out there. I think, "This is foolish to be out there all alone." Now a black car with no lights is pacing me. This feels ominous. I have trouble seeing where the road is and the edge of the road. The car falls back. No other lights are seen and I wonder if I'm still on the freeway, perhaps a side two-lane highway. Now a man gets out of the car and is walking up to me. I try to ignore him. He wants to talk. I'm worried he's going to rape me or hurt me. I keep going. He wears a dark coat. He says, "I'm a writer." I say, "So am I," hoping to discourage him from asking me to read his work. Then he pulls out two guns and says, "I have two guns." I take them and feel their weight; they seem light like they are fake and I toss them into the bushes. Now he's mad at me. I show him I have a gun too. "Where did you get that?" he asks. He digs in the bushes for his guns, which are easy to find as I didn't throw them hard. I keep walking. I see the lights of a small town ahead and am relieved. I look for a sign that says Police Station. I see one and turn to go there. The man goes into a store/gas station. I stop at another gas station where three men are standing around. I ask one where the police station is and he points and says, "Over there." I say, "Where?" He decides to take me. I wonder if the man is robbing the other station. (606 words)

I am at Ernie and Ginny's house for a visit. They are busy with Boy Scout stuff. Rigo is selling buttons and has a wooden cabinet full of little drawers with cute buttons in them. I reminisce that I used to have buttons, two big cabinets full. I start to look through them so I can choose some to give as gifts and buy them from Rigo. Then we are getting ready for some picnic event. Ginny hands me a baggie with two hamburger buns in it. Ernie keeps popping in and out and it is a joke or contest to figure out where he is before he sneaks up and scares me. He's hard to keep up with. I peek out a window and smile and wave, because I see him. I follow his progress as he hides and then pops out. I am keeping up. I go to a window and open it and lean out. Now Ernie has on a clown suit, chef outfit, a big red shirt, a huge ballooning apron, funny shoes. I laugh. Then I see another man, a neighbor, wearing the same outfit in blue and laugh and laugh at them. Ernie grins and goes to the ocean and sort of hops and dances around. I keep my eye on him and then I've lost him. I turn and "Fox," a beautiful silver-colored dog/wolf rushes toward me and growls a wild challenge. He was supposed to stay in, but I wasn't about to stop him and he leaps out the window and runs. Ginny comes up and leans out the window and I look and see tables with lots of people sitting to eat the hamburgers the clown chefs were making. I get my baggie of buns and we go out to get a hamburger, only by the time we get there, it's all gone. It's clean-up time and they bring the folded Styrofoam tables back to the patio to store. Ginny (now Katrina) sees some spots and says, "We'll need to clean this better." It has a sign on it, a paper cup with the words "Recycle Me" over some spots, meaning that it is too much to clean, leave it, but Katrina won't be stopped. She tells the guys to get the paint. Two men, one shy and homely, come in and I start to walk away. Katrina whispers, "You can't go. You're his date (meaning the homely one)." I sigh and go back, to help out. We get to talking and he says, "Fox sure was a beautiful animal; too bad about him dying at the picnic." I say, "They always attract magnificent animals to them." I guess Fox was a stray and wandered in and adopted them and then wandered out the same way. The other man asks me if I can fix things or check things better, looking at my hands. I say I can write and do reports better. He nods. We are supposed to go to his office and help him do some paperwork. (Earlier in dream, I give Ernie a joke gift filled with things I had bought from them earlier, some scouting things.) Later, I felt bad because I only gave him a cheap joke gift. I wanted to get him something really nice. (550 words)

I'm in a small town and it is late at night. A woman is crying and complaining (dark-haired woman) because she told her secrets to a friend and they got returned to her with a cup of tea, meaning she felt betrayed because her friend told others. After awhile, I said to her, "Oh shut up. Quit complaining, because you've got friends who care about you. If they didn't care, they wouldn't have been concerned and talk about you." The woman got very upset with me and approached me menacingly with yogurt on her hands and took my hand. I said to her, "If you intend to hurt me, I shall hit you." Then I smear yogurt all over her hair. We laugh then and the tension is relieved. There are a bunch of neighbors in a line on the porch watching. We get into a conversation about people trying to be helpful and I argue with them that it is bullshit that it is out of good intentions that people help me. One woman cries and walks away. Some agree. A couple offer to help me into my bed and lift me up bodily and carry me through the window to my basement room I shared with another woman who talks about her boyfriend. Then it is hard to breathe. Oh, I hear a motor and we guess it's a VW bug or bus and it's an old man's wheelchair. Then it's hard to breathe and we see yellow thin strips of confetti-like stuff all in the air and we are breathing it in. It is in the air conditioning so we all get up and go outside where it is a hot summer night. A friend says, "Come stay at my house," and I go, to find a woman and her two teenage children on the porch. She is crying and telling her children she can't stand being married to their father any more and she's leaving. The girl says, "Please stay." The mother says, "I can't." She leaves. I am laying on a mattress pillow and a small boy comes to take it in the house. It's his bed. I ask him if I can sleep on it tonight and he agrees, only if I let him borrow my manual wheelchair. I agree and he starts to cart it off. His brother -- both are dressed in tee-shirts and no pants -- pokes at the young boy's penis and smirks. I look, curious about its size and shape. Then I tell the boy, "Please don't take the chair away now, because I may need it in the night and he can play with it tomorrow." I wonder where I'll sit while he plays with it. The boy agrees and brings it back. The brother again smirks and pokes him in the penis, in a teasing, embarrassed way. They leave and I lay down wondering how far away this house is from Claude's. (The street is sort of like a summer vacation spot street.) (506 words)

"We must protest." I am a postgraduate student on a college campus and just got the news that all students of minority, of color or disabled, will be arrested if it seems they are doing anything wrong. It was called measure 60-11. I and three other students start marching, saying, "We must protest." We start walking around campus. Some white men start approaching us to stop us but we continue. More students join us and soon we are a large group walking around the campus protesting measure 60-11. I see a friend who is Chicano and he has mariachi music and I break into the yell and dance as we walk. I decide to go to the president's office and talk with him. I walk (aware that a wheelchair would look better for the cause, but am walking). I pass lots of athletic, jacketed men lounging around making nasty remarks about us. I get in a line. I see two men in wheelchairs in suits that have come to talk with the president. The one, I thought he was the president, puts his arm around the man in the chair like they are buddies and does a sobbing, sweet speech. I shake my head no. This is unacceptable. Then I realize it's two gimps. Now I'm next in line and I see the president is a woman, like the governor. A woman on crutches I recognize comes in and sits, others crowd ahead of me, but it is my turn next. She is seated and looks up at me and says, "B?" (I had signed in so she knew my name. "You have three minutes." I say, "I have something to say, and then I have a question," and I go to the question first. I ask her, "Why are you discriminating against people of color and disability? Anyone can do wrong. Anyone can make a mistake, why does this measure only single out minorities?" She suddenly stands up and backs to the wall, crying. She sobs, "It's not fair. I don't know where the check is, I didn't do anything wrong." She runs from the room crying. I suddenly realize I'd managed to plug into her own problems with one succinct question. People nearby who saw are cheering because this looks good that she will rescind the measure. I walk out to the corridor and walk to find my friends, feeling very proud of myself for again having the special intuitive powers to make this happen. I know everyone will be proud of me when they learn that has happened. I joyfully hug that secret to myself, that I did it. It did occur to me that it was possibly coincidence, but I still feel proud and happy. (459 words)

I am a counselor or housemother type person in a group of college age people. It's time for a meeting and I go to find a place to sit. I choose one place, but decide it will be too much out of the way, I won't see all that is going on. I see Howard and go to him and give him a check, some money I owe him. He is happy to get it and wants to do some figuring. I now go back through the room to find a better place to sit. I hear a young man playing drum sticks and beating out a beat and doing some rhyming chant that makes fun of me as a sexy lady. He throws the drum sticks and a bunch land in my hair. I stalk over to him and pull out two drum sticks and beat a fancy beat on the chair he sits in. Everyone is impressed with how well I do that. Another male student is behind me and kisses the back of my neck and says, "Oh Mama," in a sexy, teasing way. I whirl, angry, and grab him by the shirt. "How dare you?" I say. I yank him around and am dragging him off to my office to give him a talking to. I say to someone, "You come with me, I don't want to be alone in the room with him," but the person says, "I have to do something" and leaves. I yell for a student, a girl, and I say, "Get me Judith or any woman counselor, quick." The student starts edging away as I keep a hold on his shirt and I notice one leg is an amputated stump. I yank him back and say, "Oh no you don't." Now another man, a counselor, comes toward me and tries to bump us with a cart/table. I say, "What are you doing?" He says, like a mad man, "I am your father figure," and runs the cart up against me. I push back and manage to grab a bunch of his wiry blonde hair out of his head and I say "Well, you are going bald" (the hair reminds me of Blake). He keeps after me and I now am running away from him, dragging this poor student with me. I race through the room where the students are, they are getting ready for the meeting and someone says, "It's 7:30, get ready for the meeting," and two of them are upset because they will miss Star Trek. I have a great idea and, in the middle of this chase, collar a kid and say, "Make a suggestion in the meeting that everyone come up with $.50 and chip in and buy a VCR so they can tape stuff and watch it later." They like that idea. I see Howard; he left my check where he had been sitting. It had numbers written on it like he was figuring out some bills. He takes it and says, "Oh no you don't," and finds a phone to call someone about details. I continue running and I see the mad man still after me and gaining fast. He's holding on to some toy and it is dragging him across the floor fast. It almost catches up and I see it's not the mad man but one of the kids that had been teasing me. (571 words)

I am a school teacher and I teach like a primary grade. The kids are being rude and noisy and I get angry and yell at them that they will come in from recess right now because I've got something to teach them right now. They resist and I drag them and herd them in and make them all sit down. I am quite righteous and firm. Then I say, "We are going to learn about cooperation if it takes all day." I role play a quarrel. "This is a quarrel," I say and play-act two people arguing angrily. I say, "Yes, that is scary; anger is scary, but let's study it and learn. It's a natural emotion," and so on the lecture goes. Now my name is Ms. Woods and I am an old teacher of high school kids. They are marching in two converging columns. There had been some insults from one group to the other and I force my kids to march right into the other group and deal with things rather than ignore it. The principal respects what I did and says, "You made us face it." A smart-mouthed teen runs by and I go after him and say, "Just a minute, boy, I'm Ms. Woods. You will, if you intend to go to this school, walk with respect for other people," and so on. I catch another errant young man and do the same. I patrol the front door to catch others. Now I'm in the passenger side of a car and on a remote fix to a radio station. I am to announce the coming of an important mass like it's a rock concert. "But," I say to my driver, "it sounds like Los Angeles out here." So, he says, "Announce it like an L.A. mass." He starts jiving in the microphone as we drive up a set of stairs to where the mass is being held. He says, "Come on now, it's grooving; ever heard of Matthew Fox?? All the big guys are here, it's happening." We go in and then go up and out to the top of bleachers. The audience is waiting for the show. The first rock star comes down the steps following his prostrate and sad two wives and their children. I shake my head at their stupid act. Someone seated next to me says he's going to smoke pot and his friend says he hasn't any and will have to borrow money at a high rate to get some, but he doesn't have any choice. I laugh at that. "No choice?" I say, "You could choose to not smoke!!" A woman and I throw candy bits we bought for $3.00 to kids hiding under the bleachers. I write my name on the candy so they know who threw it. Someone got a phone call and says, "OK," gets up and puts on an army uniform from British last century with a huge plume in the hat. He has to go ask the Queen of England who wants to talk to the post office lady for ID which will require her getting her picture on video tape. "She's not going to like this," he sighs. (536 words)

A young man, Michael J. Fox, is flirting with me and almost as a dare, he runs over to kiss me on the lips. I saw it coming and decide to kiss him back for real and I do, and he opens his eyes, surprised and pleased. We like each other very much and want to be together always and want to make love and be close, but there's an age difference and I'm a teacher and he's a student, so we look for a place to be alone so we can hug and kiss and make love. The pleasurable tension of being close but pretending to be indifferent is great. We find a room, a "library," and he says, "Is this ok?" I say, "I don't know. What if someone comes in?" Just then, Merle comes in and interrupts. He is jealous. Now we leave, and "Fox" signals to me to go around the house to the side and go in there. I walk around the block and up a hill and see G walking stiff-legged down a ladder. He wants to know where I am going and I don't want him to know. He follows me. I see people on the 2nd floor of the house. It's a woman and a man getting married, or engaged. Then the woman changes her mind and chooses to marry her pregnant lesbian girlfriend. I see the ceremony and after the vows, the mother of the bride, the two women and the man all dance together. I say, "I really like that!" Merle isn't impressed, and disagrees. Now, Fox and I are walking, looking for a place to be alone. Our need for each other is great. It's so wonderful just being with him. But there is another interruption. A mentally retarded young woman wants me to take her picture and hands me the camera. I try and focus through a tiny little square and only get part of her face, and I back up and she keeps putting her fingers in her mouth and stretching out her lips. (I am somehow reminded of Rena.) I try and snap a shot when she wasn't posing and actually was pretty. I take four snaps and then we go on. Now I am an "extra" in a movie scene. Fox is the star and to be near him, I am in the scene. So are hundreds of extras. Our job is to writhe around and pretend panic, fear and agony. I am amused to see two male experienced actors chatting about mundane things as they look the part of fear and panic. I try to remember to contort my face good. The number 7 is the star part. If you are #7, you are in the movie for sure. Now we are going to walk away and find a place to be alone. My mother, angry, comes striding purposefully toward us to disapprove and interfere. Two men come toward her to ward her off and protect us. She says, "You shouldn't go with him. I would choose alcoholics or addictive persons or sugar daddies to go to my house." I say, "If that's what you want, go ahead. I don't want to hang out with people like that." We go off together and she's fuming. (551 words)

I'm going to meet Fox for a bit of lovely flying venture. I go flying, but he's not there. I circle and spiral and fly and float. It's very beautiful and I miss Fox being there. I notice a fish and air bubbles and think I've landed in an ocean and am swimming. Then I'm alone in the air again. Then I hear an airplane and realize I could crash into them. One comes through a brown, thick cloud wall and I narrowly escape a collision. I then dive for earth and land. I see Fox and he's coming to me with a girl and I realize that girl is me, in a younger time. Her hair is brown, mine is blonde. Fox can see me, but she can't. The three of us shower together. I wash her back and Fox says, "Easy. Don't hurt her." I guess I was a bit jealous. I lovingly wash his back. (158 words)

I am at a spiritual meeting of some kind with Lydia and her family, Valerie and her family, and others. A man is talking, he is the leader. I want to see a book on the Jones Town Massacre. I see many pictures in the book that are graphic and hard to look at, but it is important to look at them. I then realize that Lydia and Valerie are too easily susceptible and will believe in this man and that will be dangerous for them. I try to get us to move away from the crowd and away from the leader. There is a hypnotic quality to his delivery and it is hard to pull away. Now we have gone up a mountain and are at a spiritual retreat. Again, I feel the hypnotic pull and try to resist. They have a new recruit that has volunteered to be the gate. Her name is Joy and she just graduated from high school and is 18 years old. She is very naive and innocent. Someone says they would hate to use the joy gate, because "Can you imagine what it would be like to rip open the gate from the mountain and it's a person named Joy?" I see rocks falling as an image of this gate opens. I must leave, and I get in my van with Dwight and I drive, trying to escape the mountain. As I drive, I see that the road curves up ahead and I force the van off the paved road and drive across the field, where a barely noticeable dirt trail is. It was hard to leave the paved road. I turn and look back and see a steam vent gush on the mountain near the small collection of buildings that is the spiritual retreat community. I wonder if it is blowing up. I turn back and keep going noticing that the trail is gone and the grass is wet and muddy and we could get stuck. I push on anyway. Now, I am pedaling a bicycle, with Dwight riding on the back. We turn to the right and go past some construction. The road is muddy. We then go down a steep hill and are on the water's edge, through a lot of muddy puddles. I wonder if I'm even going the right way, or if I shall have to turn back and backtrack. Wasted time and energy. Then, I want Dwight to help pedal. I see a police car directing the detour traffic ahead and I go toward them to ask for directions. I hear a Frank Sinatra tune being sung, "My Girl. Is she blind, is she thin, does she wear stars on her dress? No." (456 words)

I hear a group singing a song and am drawn to it. I stand and listen. It is a love song and very tender and I feel so sad and vulnerable because I don't have anyone to love and want it very much. I wonder if my face is showing my emotion. Later, a woman sings a song about protecting your man, standing in front of him so he won't get hurt. I really agree with this and feel drawn again to the music. I join in and sing and find myself with a sort of barbershop quartet group doing fine harmonies. (102 words)

I am underwater in a pool and looking up. I see snakes swimming on the surface and feel fear. I prod one with a stick to get it away from me but it backfires and the snake now knows I'm there and sinks down toward me. It is huge like a boa constrictor. I hope it will go away and leave me alone. It does. Then I see dinosaurs, lots of them. Then two men are trying to crawl up to the place where I'm sitting and I take a bat and hit at them to make them go away. They persist, and I hit harder and harder. I scream for Jock to come and help me. "Help me," I call as I beat these men up. Jock runs to me and looks at the fallen men. "Oh my God," he says. "You've killed them, or nearly so. These were real people not just 'holograms' or images." I feel very bad. He says, "I'm so sorry. This is my fault for leaving you alone. I should have been here." I am depressed and without reason to live. I go away and want to kill myself. I think I'd take some alka seltzer and die. Jock realizes what I'm trying to do and is trying to stop me. Della comes in to organize my writing business while I'm "indisposed." I get very angry at her. I yell, "If you won't do it my way, then don't do it at all." She was trying to organize my stuff in her style. I realize there are some things I can learn from her, but I say, "If I decide to live, then I will want my writing to be my way. After all, it is the only reason I have to live, except for you, of course," I say to a small girl like Charla, "and that's almost not enough." Jock comes in to support me through all this so I will stay alive. There is a woman with multiple personalities. She is in her "little girl" personality, named Ulysses or something like that. She says she wants to live, being pregnant. She has beautiful, strange eyes. Odd that the love of life was finally found in the little girl part. (378 words)

I see people bringing bouquets of flowers. I sort of know they are for me but don't go look yet. I see my mother and then I wander over to see who my flowers are from. I see a box of papers, the mail and see a newspaper clipping about how beloved a stepsister-in-law I am. The flowers are gone, being hidden from me until later, a party perhaps. A man comes over and talks. He has strange beautiful hair, rainbow colors and a golden shine to it. He's a sort of distant brother-in-law or something. He seems a bit in awe of me and keeps talking about anything to keep my attention and he feels a bit embarrassed about how he is running off at the mouth. I see a baby, who grabs the whipped cream. I am given a bit of chocolate cheese cake that is an old family recipe and ask if there is sugar in it. There is, but I take one bite anyway; it is heavenly. Now the baby is making a mess with the whipped cream and I grab its little chubby arm and try to take the whipped cream away. It turns into a power struggle and I lean over and take a fold of its skin at the wrist and bite it until it is painful enough to make the baby drop the whipped cream. I won, but I don't feel good about the way I did it. (246 words)

The King of England is very proper and shy and he loves Spring Byington. He courts her in an old fashioned way. She is shy and turns her head away. He is very hurt and I see his face, looking sad. She turns back. He says, "I see, then you don't care." She says, "Oh, no, that's not it." She tells him she loved the sweet gesture of handing her a tea tray so elegantly. They smile at each other.

I go upstairs to my bedroom and see the room in a shambles, the bed turned and in the opposite side of the room. I say, "What happened here?" Aunt Naomi says, "Basketball," meaning the teen boys must have been playing basketball in my room. I say, "How am I going to get this back the way it was?" She says, "We'll get Lionel to help us." I start to go downstairs but she says, "No, let's do it the easy way, and put the phone on hold and dial 86, the extension." She does so and we wait. I see Lionel walk past the door across the hall and don't call out to him. We wait some more. Naomi calls again, number 85. She goes out. I start to move the bed myself. It was pretty easy. I almost get it in the right position but now I wait some more. [BL] (152 words)

I am in Paris but it looks like (state) countryside, with pretty aspen trees and fall leaves colors. A famous woman actress is living in the country outside Paris and rumor has it she never leaves and is unhappy, but she says she loves it there. Another actress joins her and they walk, hand in hand, talking. Three more are there. Now I am one of them and in a car. The brakes won't work and I am forced to drive it into a hilly embankment and get out. I am holding a huge crystal rock that has music in it and is controlled by a piece of amethyst crystal rock on the back, like a volume and power switch. I put it down on a rocky area, next to a fireplace on a hill. I hide the crystal side and start to walk for help. People come by and hear the music and I pick the rock back up and hide the part that works. They are curious and want to know where the music is coming from. I say there is a radio on the fireplace. They are suspicious that there is a radio in the rock. I slide the amethyst rock into my hand and walk away, down a steep hill. I'm lost. I turn and try to go back up the hill and see a pair of ropes and try to pull myself up the hill, but between the ropes are a series of little pigs I must step over. One is a meany and tries to bite me and I have to back up, hoping it comes to the end of it's leash, but it doesn't. It keeps following me and gets my finger in it's mouth and bites hard. The skin is not broken, but I am worried. I get away from it and see Mateo playing with some kids. I go to him and say, "I'm lost," and he says, "Well, I have to go to town where they will pick me up soon." I say, "Good, let's go," and he still wants to play and won't go. I try to tell him how important this is. A woman comes to pick him up, so I follow them, down a steep embankment and up a road. The woman says she hates to do this because she used to be a student with Mateo and he never does his work and plays around and she gets in trouble. (414 words)

Ellie is looking into a mirror and talking about herself. I am annoyed at her; what a self centered person! I walk away. My dream voice says in disgust, "Are you really going to wait until 9:30 or 10:00 to write this down? You'll lose too much." (I do wait and lose most of it all.) There is a General, a woman who has some information. I need to exonerate myself from some trouble I got myself into. She brings me the disks, 3.5 size computer disks. I feel cagey, not totally open to her. She asks me to reimburse her for the costs of the disks. I am the wife of me and I say, "Of course, we'll find the money somehow." Me/the husband says, "Good wife," but me/he feels somehow betrayed by the General's self-interest there, even though it was appropriate. (143 words)

There's this man who is teaching a night course in movie critiquing. He's in love with a woman who is an alien and she's in love with another man. She hires out as a butler in the creepy mansion of the bad man to check out and get evidence. I/the man who loves her, comes and disguises myself and comes in the house. I see the alien man, the mobster bad man, and follow as the butler girlfriend follows him and takes pictures. Now it is time to escape, they are on to us, so we find a corner of the lawn where a dirt slide is built into the embankment. We slide down one by one and get into something, maybe a back of a van or a room, I'm not sure. I am getting ready for bed. My parents are there, and my father is helping me get cozy. He puts a warm stocking hat nightcap on my head, mittens on my hands and little "booties" like stocking caps for my breasts. A warm robe is on after that and the blankets are tucked in and I'm saying, "Ok, it was a strange movie, there was this guy who was in love with an alien woman and she was in love with another man and then they were in the bad man's house and she was a butler, only they got suspicious because she looked alien to them." My mother interrupts, "Well, of course they would notice, how silly," and I go on telling the story of the movie and say the man in love with the woman is a movie critic who teaches a night class once a week.

I am in C City, at a University. I see Rhonda and we talk. She walks me to my black car and I get in the back seat. There is lots of junk in there. I get out to walk her back to her house so we can chat. She suggests I lock the door (or asks if I should) and I say no or yes and say, "This is where I parked the van and it was stolen." I say, "You look tired, so I'll just stay 15 or 20 minutes." I ask her how she likes her job at University and she says she likes it. I ask her what she teaches now. She says she is teaching English Comp and several other classes and one weekend sex therapy class. We are now in her house and there are lots of windows, without curtains, very wood and glass modern. The ceiling has lots of windows too. I see two black funnel clouds in the sky and I say to her excitedly, "Tornadoes. I see tornadoes." She isn't interested and I keep pointing. They whirl around and around and then disappear back into the chimneys they came out of and then pop back out and roll around. They have sharp points on the heads; they kind of look like penises. They then speed over us and I look again and see they are a flock of large black birds, with unusual beaks and faces like owls or odd big birds. They land inside the house and hop up on a ledge or piano (black). Now they are small humans or living dolls. I help one up as he is tipping over and comment on how I like the softness of his fur. He is an Eskimo doll. He thanks me. I look over to Rhonda, now seated across the room, and see how tired and sad her face is. I say, "Are you well?" She shows me a chart and on the chart are the words "smells, vagina," and other words. It's time for me to go and one of the dolls, a minister in black, says, "Where's E City?" He is an old time man who will found a church at Fall Creek. I laugh, because I know that historic old church and I say I know the way and point, "It's straight down the road, that way." I get up to go, as I am driving that way myself. (412 words)

Arvonne is my roommate, assistant and we are preparing for a presentation I will be making, a sort of seminar I am putting on. I look into a shallow fish tank and see a fat little black fish trying desperately to jump out of the tank. I laugh, because he looks so silly and intense. Then I see there is no more water in the tank and furthermore a Siamese cat from the neighborhood is in the tank playing with the fish, getting ready to eat him, when the fun is over. I see the fish's cute face and see the sadness it feels and I feel empathy for it. I get a hose and spray water at the cat to make it get out of the tank, and then, of course, fill up the tank with water, saving the fish. Meanwhile, in my preparations, I feel some anxiety about being properly prepared. I am washing my feet and scrubbing the crud off the sides and toes when co-worker Juliet comes early; I wasn't expecting her. I am pleased and surprised when I see her hairdo, a 1950's bouffant style. (190 words)

I am a business woman, a professional, and very busy. I am in a house and look out a window and see down below, outside, an old Greek style ruins with the wildness of an unkept garden through it. I wish to go see it; it looks interesting, but I am preparing for something. There are three strong, muscular men, my exhusband, a sort of Arnold Swartzenegger type, and a young Burt Reynolds type and a third man. They all love me and follow me around, getting in my way. Now I am me and I carry a cat that belongs to the busy woman the men love. I see a man who has been spreading rumors about the woman and I stand in front of him, looking down at him, and give him a strong lecture about how insensitive and cruel he was to speak about something he didn't know, only guessed at, and spread the word. Now it is causing harm to the woman. He is embarrassed and very sorry. (172 words)

I am in the passenger side of the van. Dwight and maybe Ginny are with me. We go from gas station to gas station, looking for something to put air in the tires and a bathroom, but we don't find either. I look ahead and see a tiny board across a ditch and Ginny intends too drive over it to go on. I say, "Can't you see? This won't work. Absolutely, this van will not fit on that. It's too small. This absolutely won't work." Ginny seems intent on doing it anyway, so I get out and measure the width of the tires by my hands and say, "Look at this, and the back tires, it will not fit, absolutely." Ginny doesn't say a word, but simply pushes the car with Dwight's help over the board which barely fits. They get across. I feel a bit embarrassed but say, "Well, if you push it slowly, then it works, but not if you had driven it!" Now I'm in the back seat with lots of other people and I'm seated on a man's lap. I say, "...and you should have seen the Pope in that silly dress sitting on the lap of the secret service." I realize that there might be Catholics in the van and wonder if I've embarrassed myself by being bigoted. I see a man sitting alone in the passenger side up front and feel envy. I want to sit alone where it is not so crowded. Now we are in a church and someone, an older woman, is looking at the seating chart and directing where various groups (plays, or their actors, really) will sit. She seems pleased there are no big problems. Even the Pope is behaving himself and not embarrassing us. (296 words)

We are told to line up around the room and start on the bottom shelf of books. It's a book sale and we are all grabbing the books we want to buy. Someone on my left grabs a book in my section, I say, "I already have it, it's OK," and move on. Now I see a display of glass pretties. Someone exchanges the little glass pitcher or creamer with another one that matches the bowl already there. It's like my mother's cranberry sauce bowl, glass rounded ribs. I say, "Very nice, but probably more expensive and too big to be in scale." I go on. I remember to look for a video camera case to fit my video camera and ask a man. He is condescending and looks for an ordinary case. I am annoyed. Can't he see? I say, "If you would just look at MY camera, you would see it is a more complex and advanced camera." I am annoyed he doesn't realize I'm quite good at this and not just average or a beginner. [BL] (178 words)

I am off in some arctic wasteland and it is dark. There are men out there and I hide from them. I try to see where I am going and I march in the snow and ice and nearly go over the edge of an abyss. My partner on the trek stops me just in time, by accident really, not aware we are on the brink of sliding off the edge and down a huge fall to a meandering river. The staff I use to walk with nearly goes through the snow at the cliff's edge. I back up, still unaware and find a tent. We decide to stay in it, but first I use a flashlight to look out and over the river far down below. I use the arc of the light to show where I think the bad guys are. I see a snow bar across the river, a waterfall and so on. My partner gets worried and insists I turn the light off because it will lead the bad guys right to us. I am oblivious to danger and we go into the tent. Soon the men are around the outside and we must defend ourselves. The big man has a leather glove on his hand and a long whip, and he is outside the tent whipping around trying to find us in the dark in the tent. I finally, like a bantam rooster, grab the whip and pull on it until I've wrestled it out of his hand, glove and all. Now I am whipping at him fast and competently. He's rather amazed. I go outside and continue whipping. A small "robin bird" goes in and someone says, "Stop him, he'll get hurt." (288 words)

Someone, perhaps my brother Dwight, has written a book and wants me to read it and give remarks. I do so. It has lots of colorful illustrations and I wonder if I should tell him that I think there are too many illustrations. It seems odd to be "complaining" about something fun and good. I decide to tell him, and he can do with it what he wants. I find a typo; the word "catch" is spelled "catche." I walk out to tell him. I realize I want my wheelchair and he asks if he should get it for me. I say, "Yes." Just then my three girls and their friends come out of the grove playing on my chair and we call out to them, "Hey, hey, I need the chair." They ignore us and go on and I try to yell, "Ellie." They turn back and I say, "Were you trying to pretend you didn't hear us?" They said no, smiling and got out of the chair. I got in, noticing it was my old one, and wondering why I left my new one in the building. Dwight and I go down the dirt road and turn right into a sort of wayside area in the trees. I start to tell him about my thoughts on the book, but have to stop because a small toothbrush head is stuck in my throat and I must swallow. I try to open a bottle of mineral water and it fizzes all over and then I swallow and swallow, trying to get it down. Finally it dislodges and goes down. I feel queasy, thinking about all that plastic and bristles in my insides. Then, a very short policeman comes right up to me. I thought he was hugging me, so I hug him back and then I realize he thinks I'm deaf and is leaning in to shout in my ear (my deaf one). He says he will keep an eye on the girls and I say, "That's a good idea." (340 words)

I walk down to where the ugly freaks are kept, like in a zoo, and I sit on an edge of a drop off to watch them. One has a very deformed face, his eyes very wide apart with scars between the eyes. I feel scared and back away from the edge because it feels like I could fall in with him and then I'd be in trouble. He's sort of half man, half ape. I say, "How ugly," and a woman asks, "Which one?" I say, "The wide-eyed one." She is hurt because her boyfriend looks like that. I walk away. Now I observe a woman doctor. She is newly assigned to this staff and coming to meet them. The man who runs the place meets her coming up the sidewalk and falls for her before knowing she is newly on staff. He wouldn't have liked her if he'd known. They lie down on a couch/bed and cuddle. They love each other very much. They cuddle spoon fashion and then the man grows into a huge giant monster and the woman is sad and afraid. He goes out into the streets toward a special lake where others of his kind lurk. He is dangerous. She follows. She is in the lake and feels a giant spider coming up underneath her and is afraid. She lets the spider see the other people and the baby in the hopes that that will divert the spider from eating her. It does and the woman feels guilt for sacrificing the other people for her own survival. Now a huge giant snake surfaces, a boa constrictor. It comes at her face with a wide open mouth to bite. It narrowly misses her and starts to wrap around her and she knows that even though she is powerful, she will be strangled and crushed by this huge snake. She hopes the snake will go off and find others to eat. It does. Now an image of a diagram of the many subdirectories it will take to safely lock up the giant monsters deep enough in the maze of paths in a computer directory to keep it hidden and therefore safe for the people. Beyond Garrith (the wide-eyed monster) is the name of one path. Then a path that branches off called the Poetry Path and a subdirectory called Weaving Stories. This means that if I ever need to call them back, I can use this path to get to them by weaving bits of stories together in a certain sequence, I can get them back. (430 words)

I am in a dorm kind of place and a man comes in holding an outfit on a hanger and says Rochelle needs some money and is thinking of selling this outfit. I like it, vest and gold blouse, and think of buying it because, luckily, I still have some money. Then he says, "Melinda is cleaning out the storage and you should see what lots of junk you have there. A whole trash baggie full of pop top tops." Melinda thinks that's amazing. I go out to see and find all my old clothes and shoes pinned up on the wall. Melinda says I put them here and I say, "How embarrassing, where everyone can see." I see an old ratty bathrobe and lots of silly looking slippers and shoes. "They all go," I say. "Even the shoes, because they are all flat heeled. I can't wear them." I start to go through the books and papers. I decide to keep the dance books, I give up the weight lifting books, Susie S is interested in them and a bit surprised, as I, am that I had them. I give up papers I think belong to someone else that critiques a student. I keep some of my childhood books. I look at one that is Sparkey's about women and lesbians and Sparkey's erotica art. I finally pick one, a book, to take with me. Then a man rolls on top of myself and two other people near me. He is feeling us to decide which one he'll like and stay with. He chooses me because the other woman on my left is on her side and bony. The man on my right won't do and I'm laying on my back and kind of comfortable to him, except he took me by surprise and my arm is caught between our two bodies. I get up; it's a beautiful summer day and I am walking to school. I stop, and am confused. Is this the way? Then I recognize the old path through the field and go. I ask where is registration, because I just remembered I hadn't signed up for classes yet. Here I was thinking I was late to class and I didn't even have the class yet. I see a sign saying, "Registration this way." I smile, "Ask and you shall receive." I see a greeter, who is Charleen who grimaces, bored, and waves me into the registration area. (411 words)

A man and his brother are with Ellie and me. He is an Eskimo and we sit together on a bench at a table. He hugs me and kisses and I start to remember how good it feels to have someone be physical with me. He looks like Brent from playwright class. Ellie doesn't want anything to do with his brother and so he goes off to find someone else. Now I'm with him and a man comes to the car I'm in (I'm in the backseat) and tries to force me to make love to him. He kisses me and I go limp and then I bite him hard and he gets more vicious and I decide to just "take it" and get it over with. I hate it. He leaves and the cops come and I point to the house he's in and call them violent kids. (149 words)

I tell Jock about a dream I had about having incest relations with my father. He disapproves and doesn't want to hear. He is insensitive and moves away. I am hurt. I think, "Maybe I don't want to know this information." I now need to lock up. I walk down a flight of stairs to a basement door and lock it. The door accidentally opens a bit and I see a lone man seated on a single bed off in the corner. I shut the door and lock it and go back up the stairs. I see two girls playing in a bank of dirt. They are forming stairs out of the dirt. I think that is interesting. Now the two girls had a bath and I am helping to dry them off with a towel. I am aware I should not touch the girls unnecessarily. I dry off the dark-skinned girl and turn to see Charla in a corner, turned away from me, and I see she is playing with her vagina which is upside down and has two red and two yellow strands of something. I am repulsed. I try to draw her attention to get her to stop. Now Ginny/Karen and I are dancing like the 1940's jitterbug. (211 words)

I see a neat computer program in a computer and suggest we network our computers so I can use it too. We do and I am delighted about what this program does. I write in a story and it creates a moving picture or cartoon response to my words. It's very fast and well done. I hear two male voices, both talking at once, and comment that this was actually two parts of my mind that were working simultaneously, one intuitive and the other analytical. (85 words)

I am in my house. Howard's bedroom is on the second floor and mine is in the attic room on the first floor. I see his face and think sadly, "We never connect. It's been years." I try to feel OK about connecting, but just can't. Someone is cleaning up, vacuuming. I see a pile of marbles on the floor. I start to walk down the stairs, which are a spiral type, and nearly fall because I was not paying attention and stepping on the little tiny edges at the center. I realize and pull back and carefully walk down the outside edges. I go outside and see a little girl and pick her up. I feel so lonely. I lie down and my head is on the legs of a nice man; we are sort of on a beach area. He observes. The baby says, "I bit my mustache." I laugh. She is so cute. I say, "Where?" I kiss her on her cheek lovingly. (166 words)

I am doing my business and somehow things are not coming together well. I don't know what the next piece is and I kind of put things together as best I can, but I finally walk away from a big mess in the center of the room. It feels like a play I'm writing. Now I am a woman, like Cybil Shepard, and I am married to Robin Williams. Robert DeNiro likes me also, because Robin does. He follows, with intent to charm me. We are all now being followed by a mobster man and his henchmen who will kill or rape me. I decide to take a shower. I go into the shower stall and am worried because one of the henchmen is in the shower stall next to me, looking for me. He senses I'm there and tries to rip open the metal wall between us. Meanwhile Robert is washing his face in a sink and is trying to clean up so he will be more acceptable to me, and next to him is Robin who walks into another shower stall and sits naked on a toilet, his penis tucked down in the bowl like I've seen Howard do.

I am trying to put on a glove; it has the fingers removed, which makes it easier, but it is still a struggle. It is pink and goes all the way up my arm to the shoulder. I see my white blouse underneath it. There is only one glove for the left hand. I feel great happiness at being able to finally get it over my bent fingers and the bandage I wear on my wrist. Another woman wears a black lacy glove. (83 words)

I put my head on Howard's shoulder and it is sweet and warm. I hold a teen-aged kitten in my lap and it is all happy and excited when Dwight enters the room. I say to him, "Oh, of course, she's got a thing for you." Now I sit in a easy chair and a pudgy man I don't like sits in it with me, which makes it crowded. I feel sleepy and start to lean over to my left and lay my head on the arm of a man there. I shift position and the pudgy man tries to get me to lay my head on him, but I don't want to. My first thing I try to do is pretend I'm asleep, but then I wake up and say to him, "Don't." (134 words)

I'm on a swing thing. There are others and Drew is on one and he likes me and there is a sort of courtship. It is informal and slow. Then there is a short man who is nervous and follows us. The rains have fallen and now the plants are going crazy in a growing fervor. The wooden benches grow up two feet from the force of the plants growing under them. A wall board, or series of wall planks, has plants on them that before the rains were from top to bottom, but now only cover 1/2 the board surface, because it is the boards that are growing like crazy. There is a sense of excitement and happiness at all this wonderful, wild growing; relief. It's been so long since the last rain. (134 words)

I am a teacher or a teacher's aide. One boy tries to sneak out the door. He thinks it is locked. I ask him where he's going. He says he wants an ice cream. I smile and say "OK, I'll get you one." I open the door. The doorknob wobbles, but it opens and I go down the hall to get the ice cream, even though it isn't the right time or place for that to happen. Now I am at the top of stairs, time to catch a plane. I need to go to the bathroom and leave my purse and papers out on the floor, wondering if anyone will take them. Perhaps I shouldn't leave them unattended (the purse reminds me of the one I lost in Junior high that had a silly picture of Mr. W). I come back out and they are still there. I see the janitor has swept the stairs and left half of each step covered with the dirt/leaves and debris. I try to step on the cleaned sides. Toward the bottom, lots of people and I are racing, accelerating our speed, but not on purpose. It is the function of going down the stairs, and I hope I don't miss a step and fall on my face. I rush for a plane. (220 words)

There is a destroyer or U-boat out on the ocean and I (or Dwight) have a flare gun. I must stop the boat from getting us, but that is too big a thing to do, so I choose to kill the Captain, assuming that if I stop the top of the chain of command, then I will have disabled its power. I fire a green flare into the right side of the Captain's chest. He falls, clutching his wound. It takes a while for him to die, but he finally does. Now I enter my parent's bedroom without knocking. I realize after I enter, it could have been embarrassing and I should have knocked. I see my new special outfit on the floor and I pick it up, saying to my mother, "I knew it was on the floor and I meant to pick it up." She asks if I intend to wear my special outfit now. I say, "Yes." The feeling is that it should be reserved for special occasions, but I just want to wear it because I like it. It is black with roses on it like my new bedroom curtains. I leave. I need to find a bathroom and try to convince myself that it's OK to pee as I'm really in a bathroom, and not dreaming it. Now Dwight and Corinne have a newborn baby boy and I want to see it. He's asleep and I smile at him, but I wonder if he can be comfortable as his head is off the edge of the dresser they have him on and it looks like he'd fall or get a stiff neck. Later, Lydia is pregnant. Doug makes a nasty, Doug-like selfish comment and I fix my eye on him and glare. He glares right back and I feel uneasy but continue to stare, realizing this is the first time I've had the guts to let my true feelings be authentically known. (327 words)

Charlton Heston and I are sitting somewhere and he reaches out and puts his finger up to a plastic tube and licks a few drops of the clear substance in it. Suddenly there is fear because he has drank of the poison and he will die of cattle anthrax. But then he knows that it is he that is saved because a few drops under the tongue of the poison will inoculate you from the disease. He tells me to take this syringe and stick a few drops under my tongue. I am afraid to, but I do it. Now we must get the serum to others. I see a doorway into an old hovel where a woman and her husband Jed and their many children live, isolated and alone in poverty. A woman is afraid and judgmental. "Don't go there. It's dangerous, they have the disease." But I choose to go in and try to tell the woman why I'm here and get permission to inoculate the children. The husband has the disease and is dying. The children are afraid, but they let me. I ask for clean water to keep things sterile. They don't even have that. So I stick them and then the teen daughter puts on an odd bra over her eyes like she's got a silly mask on and wears provocative garters and undies. Charlton smiles in enjoyment of the young woman's beautiful figure. Then I do it too and Charlton is in love with me for being so brave and no so silly and sweet. We play coyly. Then the woman begins crying. She laments that the Lord has only given her trouble. He has taken Jed from her. He has taken this and that. She sings her pain. I suddenly sing counterpoint, "And the Lord gave you life," meaning yes, there is trouble and there is beauty in life. Just being alive is beauty. He gave us that too. Charlton is so touched by my song, which I'd been afraid to sing, because I'd be ridiculed or thought crass. He hugs me to him and I sob, "Oh Jed, Oh, Jed, I love you so." He sobs, "And I love you too." We cling to each other, sobbing, and he leans us against a wall, sort of sexy and movie star like. A woman says, "And the only one in charge is the wind." (401 words)

There is a second story deck around the building and I see the wood is stamped with the name Dougal. I look for my new camera because I want to take some interesting pictures of a dirt pile, an aquarium being made, and a tree with interesting lighting, but I can't find my new camera. I find my old one and take pictures, but I am unsure of the exposure times and focus. I then find where my father has accidentally put my camera away in the living room closet. I use it now. I am now in a spacious bathroom where I lay down on a futon/chaise lounge thing to suntan. There is a choice of music, chips and crackers to eat. It is pleasant. I get naked and enjoy the relaxing moment. (134 words)

I am in a house and I have 6 roommates, males and females. I look around and see four monkeys outside the window up on a patio shelf. I am amazed by them. I remember there are three monkeys and the fourth one is a bit ragged and we just found him. It is fun that they are out for a while. I see one monkey go into the house and then back out through a doggie door and I think I really like that feature of the house. I hadn't noticed it before. I see a blue comforter quilt on the wall and I like that too. I wonder why I had been thinking of moving when this house is so nice and suits me so. One of my women roommates is angry at Page. She won't look at a device that is a plastic child toy thing with a music treble staff sign in it. It twirls and has cute music and she won't look. I encourage her to relax and look at it. Finally she does. I say, "See, not so bad. Page is not so bad." Now I see a man, a roommate, and he wants his kit back that I've had in my purse for a long time. I feel some guilt and shame because it's broken in there and parts of it are lost in the bottom of the purse. The tube of antihistamine is lost. I look and look, finding lots of cortisone pills and complain the bottles always open up and dump pills in my purse. I do find the tube and am elated. "See," I say, "I did find it!" Now Charla is seated near another male roommate and she starts crying, "I hurt, ow, it hurts." "What hurts?" I ask. "My eyes," she says. I say, "Maybe it's time to get ready for bed. Come on, I'll get the bath going." We walk off and I am gentle and caring. I give her a nice bath and tuck her into bed. (341 words)

I'm in a line getting ready to get into the parade. I start to take my place and notice I'd be walking behind a garbage truck and change my mind. Then I let several people ahead of me. I see Archie, and he has a wagon contraption tied to him and he is dragging a man around as part of his costume. I wonder if that won't hurt the man to be drug around so much. He doesn't seem to mind. Archie leaves to go to the bathroom; the line starts to move. Several women shove ahead of me and I shove them back. We have a shoving power struggle and I win, but feel silly having done that, also feel surprised I did that and kind of pleased. I try and drag Archie's wagon to help keep him in line. He catches up and we go through a gate and he puts his arms around me from behind and says, "I missed you at Asa's house." I hesitate and then lean into his tentative embrace. I say, "No one asked me." He says, "I hoped you'd be there," and then he kisses me and I respond and we roll and do contact improv things as we kiss and embrace. It feels wonderful. (213 words)

I find a place where I can travel sort of from one dimension to another through a sort of hole. I find two and then a third and notice they are in a straight line, like stops down a highway. The third one I am going to make into a more comfortable passage through by making a larger hole I can pass through and hiding it with a false door kind of thing, like a trap door. It is sister energy, linking sister minds. Now I am in a group and one of the members says he's channeling someone and speaks strangely. I watch his eyes closely since I think he's faking. I'm not sure, so I listen to him as well. He says he's going to start with Howard and he takes two small pliers and puts them on Howard's earlobes like they were earrings. They have rounded red handles. He uses a larger one, a matched set, on Howard's neck. I wonder if that hurts Howard and feel protective. The leader is seated to my right, Howard to my left and the channeler across from me. Then the channeler says, "And I'll do her next," meaning me. I gulp and say, "OK, but can I go to the bathroom first?" Someone snickers on my left, someone between Howard and me in the circle. I laugh and then hurry out to find a bathroom. I am in Aunt Elaine's house and go where the bathroom used to be and see it's a bedroom. They have remodeled. Some girl in the bedroom says, "It's that way." I turn right and walk into a laundry room. She says, "The other way." I go back toward Elaine and Lionel's bedroom and ask if I can walk through. Someone says yes. I find the bathroom and sit on the toilet, noticing in my peripheral vision that there is only a white gauze curtain separating me from the other bedroom, where I see Uncle Lionel, naked spread-eagle on the bed. I am aware of his bulky chest and big legs and don't see a penis, but know it's there. He has smooth skin and no hair. He is big and clearly masculine, but since I don't see the penis, there is an odd, womanly view of the pubic area. I see through the crib walls between us that line the curtain. I am embarrassed, but pee copiously and have a small bowel movement, hoping I'll be quiet and not stinky. I get out of there and return to the group. I notice the channeler is now usurping the leader's chair and smile, like this is more proof he is faking and only wants to be like the leader. (454 words)

I have finally finished a schedule of pill taking and am relieved I no longer have to take these pills. It feels good. I get in the passenger side of the car to return home. Something about Grandma Mildred. We forgot something, maybe the key to the house, and she goes back to get it. I sit, waiting, and then realize I have the key and we can go in to wait for her return. I get out and try to find the key in my purse. I finally find it. A girl comes by with a note from Grandma. A man reads it and sighs, I might have known to not send her. She's buying things for the house, a refridge and a stove for the kitchen. [BL] (128 words)

I am sent to pick up Kylou in my van. Then we pull up to a Burger King place and get food. When it is time to back out, I have trouble because lots of cars, bicycles and kids are close by and I try to get turned around without bumping or hurting anything. I comment, "I nearly hit a couple of fast moving kids. They darted into my space and I nearly got them." So we drive and Kylou says, "Oh look," and gets out. She has seen clowns, three or four, on a street corner. I get out and follow. They are white faced and in colorful clown costume. I wonder if they are drug dealers and watch, hoping Kylou doesn't get in trouble. She is in the group and having fun, laughing. I stand nearby. The police come and it appears I am in the group and they arrest me. I try to explain the circumstances. He has cold blue eyes, very good looking, with a police mask or helmet on so all I can see are his eyes and cheek bones. He arrests Kylou and I try to defend her, saying she wasn't a part of this. They get very belligerent and I realize that I am in the hands of cold, cruel men and I'd better shut up. He beats me on my face and then handcuffs me and puts me in the back of the car. I know to resist will get me more pain. I sit there, angry and scared. They are in the front seat and a sheet of glass is between us. I see two packages, one for each one, and see their names. The one in the passenger side is called Dukie. The driver is Reynold or something like that. Then I take a Kleenex and press it to my upper lip. I see blood from the beating and tuck the Kleenex into my waistband of my skirt for evidence. Then I press a leather bag thing they used to beat me with and see the blood forms Reynold's name and this is even better evidence. I hide it too, hoping they won't find it later when they search me. Now I am in my cell and a woman prisoner comes in to beat me up. I know I have to resist and I know it will be painful. She's claiming territory. She's pushy and threatening (arrogant). She puts a gauze muzzle on me that covers my whole face like a dog muzzle thing and she is going to beat me. Just then one of her guards or henchmen tries to get her attention to show her this magnificent puppet theatre I have in my cell. She won't be interrupted until almost too late. Just as she is ready to hit me, she turns and sees it and leaves me to admire it. Now somehow I am saved. I have status. This thing had been sent to me by friends on the outside. I also have a beautiful coffee server set, clear glass cups and pot, lots of other pretty things too. Now my cell is The Place To Be. I have power. It's like a minimum security place and sometimes I have to hide the things when the guards come by, but mostly, no problem. The guards come by and my things -- three statues or puppets -- are live men and they turn and hide in a crumbled group in a corner. The woman guard comes in and sees my groovy sports bra and sneers. She wouldn't wear one like that. I have one and I see how shapely it makes me. She is envious. Now I am following her down the hall, going for some meeting or interview. (631 words)

I am furious at everybody. I scream angry words at Howard. I threaten to throw out two little boys. I am angry at Dovre and her new boyfriend, a white-haired man named Sam who is 48 years old. Dovre is talking about marrying him and they've only just met and he's my age, old enough to be her father. (He reminds me of Dino.) I want them all out of my house, except Dovre. She can stay. But she is angry at me, hurt, and decides to stay with a dog-like animal who is very nurturing and nurses her babies for four years, much longer than most animals like her do. I see her nipples and feel some disgust. Dovre leaves and I sort of don't blame her. (128 words)

I am walking with Barry. He and I like each other, but he is involved with another woman. So we walk down some stairs and around, he wants to show me a place to sit where not many people are around. We are talking. We come around a corner and find a laundromat. A woman Barry knows is there and they exchange greetings, I am vaguely aware of embarrassment, caught, but maybe she won't notice. A lovely black and white dog recognizes me and is surprised and pleased to see me. She/he raises his paw to shake my hand. I say, "Weren't you a horse, before?" He says yes. I say, "But now you've decided to stay on the farm." He says yes. I say, "Isn't a bit of a comeuppance for you? (or a step down)." He says, "It depends on your point of view." I smile, realizing I had been prejudicial. "Oh yeah," I say. We chat. I smile again at the dog, sort of absentmindedly, and he automatically jumps up and raises his paw to be shaken again. Then Barry sees a male friend of his in a beret hat. They greet. Barry asks him, "How are you?" He says, "Fine." They talk. Then Barry asks about particulars and he says he lives with ____, a man. Barry says, "Oh, roommates," like he's remembering his girlfriend guiltily. I now am walking with the man and listening to him talk. "Are you still in elementary education?" I ask. He says he is. I wonder if that's a good idea, him being gay and all. I hope nobody finds out or he'll be in trouble. (276 words)

Howard wants to make love and I want to make love, but not to him because I don't want to have to be obligated to do it with him all the time. I choose to walk away, feeling sad for us both. Then Merle comes by and kisses me. I want to pull away from him. Then I am trying to get my name typed on a business card and am at a store trying out a typewriter that does that. The salesman is sweet and good-looking, like Tom, sort of, only nicer and better. Merle is on my right. On my left, I have a box full of credit cards that I collected over the years. They are still in their envelopes. I notice that I have some of Merle's that had been sent to my address and I never forwarded them on. The typewriter crumbles a card and I have some trouble but finally make it work and admire the look of the type. I decide to keep the old, outdated cards so I can refer to their various layout designs. I am ready to leave and stand. The man leans on a wall and we flirt. Then he pulls me to him and we kiss. It is sweet and I love it. He asks me to dinner and I agree, thinking he means I will cook dinner. I go home and fix spaghetti. He comes to the door and says, "Let's go out, my treat." I pull him in, laughing, "Another time, this time I've cooked for you." He says he'll be on TV later; the feeling is he has something he needs to tell me but can't because he's afraid I'll leave. I say, "The food is on the stove, where my mother left it." We sit at the big table. I have some trouble getting between the stove and the table, but manage. We eat, then sit on the couch. I lay down with my head in his lap so happy to be with him. The TV comes on and I wake up, but I finish the dream in my mind. He was in prison, perhaps taking a rap for a friend and has been released on good behavior. He desperately wants to be loved and I want to love him. (386 words)

The baby needs a bath and everybody out, this house hasn't been cleaned for years, the blue stairs. I receive the baby from Ellie and I see she has been neglected. Her ears have crud in them and her hair is dirty and her skin. I feel sorry for her and decide to bathe her. I go to an old, big sink and start the water. I see a bar of ivory soap. I talk soothingly to the baby saying, "I know you don't like this but I need to get you clean." She doesn't resist and I clean her up good. "Where are the Q-tips?" I ask and she tries to struggle. "I guess I shouldn't have said it out loud," I say. She relaxes. I clean her ears. I notice I haven't rinsed the soap off her hair and face well enough and rinse her under the faucet. Now I wrap her gently in a blanket, and we go out to the main part of the house. It's a mess. There are lots and lots of rooms with building blocks (child's toys all over the floor and lots of clutter). I get angry and call out, "Everybody come here in a circle in the living room. We have to talk." I think there sure are more people living here than I thought. Three old homeless types lay on the couch and refuse to help or participate. I say, "Look, either move into the circle or I call the police and you're out of here." They grudgingly start to move. I walk down some weird rickety blue stairs that overlap themselves and end before they reach the floor and then I see more to the floor. I step into the center of the forming circle. (296 words)

I am in a house, presumably my parents house. There is a flood which messes up things on the ground floor but doesn't get so high it reaches much more than the floor. It's a mess. Now there are looters running around and grabbing at anything they want. It's sort of like a store with products on shelves. I don't want to do that. It's wrong, but then I see everybody doing it and I see some pads of paper, so I change my mind and grab a bunch of pads of paper (writing lined paper). It's a mess there and it's sad to waste so much with destruction. I see a black fuzzy kitten flying around the room and I want to catch it. I try and try and finally get it. It has a feather and a note on paper tied to its collar. I try to read the note, handwritten in pencil. Now I hold the kitten, but it is flat like a piece of paper and I am disappointed, not nearly as much fun as a real kitten. I have my coat and I'm looking for a place to hang it. The usual living room closet for coats is not there anymore and I see across the room a series of hangers on the wall and I hang the coat up there. Now I decide to run away with my little girl (like Charla). We get into a red convertible car and I am driving and the little girl is crawling from the front to the back and up by the door and she's making me nervous because that could be dangerous. So I find a place to pull over, kind of muddy and gravel-like, but it will do, and I sit the girl in the driver's seat and say in a lecturing tone, "Look, this is really dangerous and I don't want you to get hurt, so let's do up your seat belt." I convince her, but she's not too happy. I'm in the passenger side and am trying to drive and realize that this won't work, so I explain to her and we trade seats. I try to fasten my seat belt, but there are only too outies clasps and then I see there are only two innie clasps and then I see there are two seat belts and I find an innie and an outie and clasp them together.

A detective man is attracted to me. There is an invisible bad guy, father, lurking around and we are trying to get evidence that he exists. Perhaps my brother Jake has taken some photos that show the shadow of the invisible people. He won't let us near where he has buried the evidence and I figure out where it is. The photo shows my "mother" having an affair with another man. My "father" is revengeful. I figure the information is buried in some boxes in the back end of the kitchen pantry room under the floor. I start to go there. The father pulls his laser gun and threatens to burn me if I persist. I know I must do it. I tell him, "You can no longer choose for me what I can know or not know. I must do that myself." He burns me with the red laser ray and it is excruciatingly painful, but I persist and fire back to him with my laser ray. We fight it out and I win. Now I am negotiating with the family, and the detective man who I love and loves me waits outside playing with the dog or a young boy, a younger brother of mine, waiting. Now I am going on stage to audition, singing with some already proven groups. I sing and hand my tapes to the woman who says that it's nice, but they have lots of voices as good. I sing for another group and then get together with the young man. We will do a duo and do it well. (266 words)

My sister Lydia shows me her wound from surgery on her hip. She says, "You may not want to see it. It's pretty messy." I hesitate and then Mirabelle and I look. It is hard to look at, lots of bloody gauze bandages and so on. Then I look up at the window and see lots of drips of water coming off the top window casement. Then I see it is blood, probably from Lydia's wound. It is dripping past the bleeding heart plant hanging in the window and I comment, "How ironic, eh?" My parents are gone this evening looking for a washer and a dryer for me. Spooky things happen. I feel a bit scared. Finally they return and they say they already took the machines to E City, that's what took them so long. We'd been doing laundry all night, which is part of why the lights went out and scared us.

Howard is crying with true grief. I am surprised and tender. He says "Twelve years and I'm a failure." His wife Karen is divorcing him. He is in emotional pain. He says if he can't fix it, he'll commit suicide. I sit, lay down next to him, concerned. "How serious are you?" I ask. He says he knows how he'll do it. I mention that I have been counseling a young man who feels the same. Then I feel bad because it is the man Karen had an affair with and this will make Howard feel worse if he knew. I feel genuine sorrow for Howard. I want to help. (110 words)

My job as a volunteer for this civic organization is to give the children a bag of candy. Then I tell them to hang it up in this one place, and then as they talk to me, someone from behind a curtain behind them takes the candy back. It's supposed to be funny. One boy is hanging on o the bag when the hand comes out to take it and they tussle over it. This happens over and over. The kids are disappointed and sad. Then the job is over and the curtain opens and the volunteers come out to take a bow, with the kids. I wonder if they got their candy after they went behind the curtain. They form two rows to take a bow and I know I'm supposed to join them, but I don't want to. I feel kind of bad about my part in this. (150 words)

I have a camera and it's not working right so I am trying to figure out what's wrong. Everything seems threaded right and then I see a huge wad of folded negatives like computer paper folded, only they are negatives already developed. Someone says, "You waited too long. There must be 5000 of them and the max to be able to develop or print is 4000." I hope I can get them printed anyway. Someone says is this a cheap Kodak Instamatic and I am insulted. "No, this is a cannon, sir." (92 words)

I tell Richard R I am having hypnogogal images and I watch them as I try to figure out what they are and what they mean. I see words on a page, some very colorful yellow. I am impressed with how much I see and recognize. A woman is being operated on. A special throat surgeon comes in to work on her deformed vocal cord. Since theey're there anyway, maybe there is something that can be done. The nurse is like Marilyn of Northern Exposure. She helps him put on his gloves as he enters the sterile field. One drops to the floor, they hesitate and then put it on anyway. (111 words)

We are captured by aliens and brought into a room where we are prepared for a journey. We are given complementary drinks and an outfit. Then we march down a path. Sometimes we are grouped together and sometimes we are spread out, so I walk between groups alone. Dovre sees a train stopped near us and playfully, with curiosity, crawls in the window of the train. I am very upset and scream at her, "Get out now. How dare you endanger us all!" The train starts moving, taking her away, but she manages to jump out in time. I am very upset with her. We continue walking. A man leaps up behind me and is violently trying to stick his penis up my ass, spoon fashion. I strike at him and then grab a pointed stick and slash at his penis area. He is forced away from me. I put the pointed stick in my belt trying to figure out which should be on top, the sword or the stick. Now I have graduated by this decision to keep the sword and stick with me. So I go back to the room and look for the cubicle with my name on it. It will have my new outfit. I find it among many others, all women, lots of crinolines and stuff. I put on my new outfit and it is sexy black lingerie, sort of playboy bunny style, or French cut. I wonder what my next job is and then I see it is to be the welcoming hostess for the new inductees -- a bar with flowered drinks, a chat and then they go out on their journey. I realize I can now sense the aliens upstairs and the woman next to me is talking about how I can do that and I am angry at her. "Now they know, thanks to you," I say. So I think a barrier around me to block my feelings and thoughts from them. I am now spirited up through the ceiling to the second floor by their power. I keep myself guarded until I know if I'm safe or not. Now Kenneth is the doctor and doing a test and I am looking at the results of his test and I say, "You can write pretty good." We go outside and I see a tall tree blowing in the breeze and for a moment I think I'm in danger because it will fall over on me, but not so. I think it will be nice to go with someone as they do their work. I'll just enjoy the comradeship of being with them. I choose a different path to walk than the one I was on. (454 words)

I am at a group thing and feeling unsure of myself. A young man tells me he thinks I am very self assured and I am very surprised. An old man, seated and with white hair, is leading the seminar and talks to each person as he goes around the inside of the circle. He looks up to me, even though I am seated in the wheelchair. I am looking through a pile of straightened newspapers, looking for the paper. I find one, but the rest are comics and other pages of other newspapers. The young man tells me in excellent detail how he sees me as self assured. I am impressed with his wonderful ability to describe me and it feels great to have someone able to give me this helpful feedback. He wants to be my boyfriend and help me. I am walking toward a set of stairs and he walks in front of me so I can lean on him. I do and then we hold hands. I look at him and am unhappy to see he is shorter and a year younger than me, like he's in junior high and I'm in high school, but he's nice and my friend so we walk together. Now I have to leave, it's the end of the summer and my father is going to pick me up and the boy is sad because his very rich father controls him and won't let us write to each other. I suggest we get private PO boxes and write. He agrees. I walk up a flight of stairs and wave goodbye, being surprised and a little sad, I do not try to kiss him goodbye or hug. It's so non-feeling and nonchalant. I stand at the road's edge waiting. I see a small plane in the air and realize the private airfield is nearby. I watch a small plane being buffeted about by the wind and wonder with surprise if that's what happens to me, although it doesn't feel like it when I'm in the plane. Now years have passed and the boy is now a crazy man locked in a cell for years. My husband and I visit. The crazy man is put into a vat of boiling like water stuff and then my husband talks to him, trying to reassure him to "come out" of his craziness. The crazy man holds some round plastic things we'd got from a circus years ago and I then announce I have the triangle pieces and they fit together and the man is being cured. My husband role models for him how to be a normal human and he is learning. (447 words)

Ginny is gone and Ernie is sad. I want to comfort him and he resists because he's afraid it will be using me. I reassure him it's OK because I'm his friend. I tell him how Ginny came to see me and I gave up all the activities I could to be with her and I'd do the same for him. A bad man comes through and demands to know where the bathroom is. I take him down a hall. I look in to the right and see a broken bathtub and it is dirty. I look across the hall and that bathroom is messy too. I apologize for Ginny. I say, "She usually keeps it clean, but she's gone for a while." (123 words)

Bonnie thinks I would look pretty if I wore some jewelry. She goes in and finds two rings for me to wear, a pearl cluster and the large nay ring (mother of pearl) of Darryl's. I start to put it on the left hand, and change it to the right hand. They look OK. Brian, a young blonde man, follows Bonnie around because he loves her. She doesn't take him seriously. He's far too young. She laughs at him gently. Then he shifts his attentions and loves me. He stands behind me and cuddles me and puts one hand near my crotch. I am shocked a bit and try to get him to move his hand. After awhile, I start to accept that he loves me and start to like it and respond. (133 words)

I see Dr. Fleischman and Magi from Northern Exposure gently arguing like they do. There is a school dance, like end of year dance, in the gym and Dr. F is laying out small round spots that alternate indent, outhunt, and he wants to make sure no one accidentally steps on them, because if they do, the energy or electricity is spent or injured. He nearly steps on a couple himself. There are two rows, one at each end of the gym. (82 words)

Jack Nicholson likes me and my foot hurts (my right one) and I have to get in the wheelchair to make it around. It's time to leave for the weekend and I ask this young woman to hand me this and that until my lap is full. I say, "Put these bags of chips in my back pack." She says there are already some there, no room. I say, "Oh well, I'll take them anyway." She stuffs them in and Jack and I start to go home. Now we are in a restaurant with teal blue walls like my bedroom. My mother with teal blue eyes (which is unsettling) and my father are there. We are going to have dinner with them. (122 words)

It's time to downsize the Goodwill factory I'm in charge of. I see the crew of sewers threading their needles. They each choose a piece of used clothing to repair. They stand in a line before a big rectangular clothing bin, then they take them to the resale clothing store. I am going to the front door to open it. I have the key. As usual, several people are waiting to get in first. I open the door and hang up the key and notice I need the key to open the cash register. I have trouble getting the key string off the corner hook and then decide to wear it on my left wrist, even though it will be heavy and cumbersome. I get the bottom drawer open and I see fake 50 cent pennies stuck together. An older woman brings her purchases to me and I calculate it on the calculator because I can't get the cash register to work. It comes to $3.00 and some cents. She puts a pile of coins on the counter and I start counting. It's not enough because she's also put rectangular saint liberty (sweet liberty?) dollars there and they don't count as real money. One is a faded stained glass. A young woman is waiting, holding her crying baby! I say, "Let me hold her." I put her carefully on my shoulder, on a burp rag and pat her! It feels wonderful to hold a sweet baby. She quiets down. She's a newborn. (252 words)

I am cleaning up some papers, letters and books. I feel bad because I have ignored this nice man named Wendel W____. I decide to write him a letter of apology. I write in different colored inks (like my journals and dream books) I take it to him. He is very happy. We lie down together on a bed and I am on top. We make love, but I don't feel the sexual feelings in the dream. We decide not to do the ejaculation in me, so I won't get pregnant. (91 words)

I am walking and a Native American man with bright colors painted on his face calls me over and tells me I should take his class. I need it, he says. I choose to sit on the other side of a flat platform, away from the other students, I think because of my wheelchair, but I'm not sure why. He is an excellent teacher, coming up to me and challenging me to think differently. He calls himself a soul dancer, and he says I can learn from him, even if he is a brown man (meaning a black man). I feel a bit of shock that I feel some slight prejudice. After experiencing his one class, I agree to return. It is good for me. I go on home now. (130 words)

I am seated in a rocking chair in the middle of a hall. I get up and start walking back, perhaps toward the basement. Then I decide this takes a lot of energy and I would be better off if I turned around and continued my journey in a forward way, the way I was going originally. I see the rocking chair is in the middle of the hall and move it out of people's way to the right side of the hall, but it is next to and blocking the door of a woman's room. I peek in and see Peggy M standing there with a walking cane. She smiles at me. I imagine how noisy and awkward it would be to sit in the rocker and try to travel like it was my wheelchair. I decide to walk on. (141 words)

I see Jeramy T and he is leading a men's singing group. They are doing beautiful harmonies and chants like monks. They are in a round area and I want to sing with them. I have my two daughters, Ellie and perhaps Paulina. I take them by the hand and walk around the outer walls of this area looking for an opening to go in and watch and listen. I find one and sit on a large rock and listen to the beautiful sounds. Now I am somewhere else and holding a baby who is crying and very uncomfortable because she has wet her diapers and her clothes. I lay her down and Aunt Millie and Bonnie are near and we are talking. I shush us and say, "Now they will think we are visiting," like that would be viewed as a bad thing. I try to change the baby's clothes. The diaper is a Pampers kind of thing that is transparent in places and built up in places where it is needed. I get it on, unsure of how to do it. I ask my daughter to get her blanket. I put her in a sleeper and I hold her, realizing she is now asleep. I can tell because her entire body is curled and relaxed like a cat. I know it must feel wonderful for her. I pace, holding her and look for a place to sit down, but every place is filled with people. I am a bit annoyed, but don't want to wake the baby. It feels good to hold her. Now my roommate has two tickets to two evenings of entertainment. I already got my two tickets for Tuesday and Thursday night. Hers is for two other nights. I think of going with her and getting tickets, only then I'd be going out four nights in a row and maybe we'd not get seats together. Some movie star man sits next to another man and I wonder if they are lovers. (336 words)

I see flood waters in the city street and see three houses floating and "dancing" in the water. I become aware that I am dreaming and feel interested. I think to myself that I can change something and wonder what to change. I say, "Let it be beautiful." I feel myself rising in the air and flying. I see a cartoon-like house with square window eyes, the eyes like headlights of a car, with light coming out of them. (79 words)

I am holding a baby boy and he changes into a sort of cute, large lady bug-like creature. I hold him carefully. I like him. I am walking, now, holding Rena up as I am taking her in to take her bath. Another woman is in the tub already and I think of putting the baby into the bath with her, and then feel embarrassed I would think of doing that without even any consideration for her wishes. She gets out and starts to drain the water. I start to clean the tub for Rena. She gets in too quickly, some of the other woman's water is still in there. Her face is right at the surface of the water. I smile and ask if she is OK. She says yes. (131 words)

I am driving in the M City like country, looking for something to do; I'm bored. I stop and get out and walk up a dry, dusty road and look at some old broken down buildings that have historical significance. They are beautiful (or were) Victorian houses that will be refurbished by a wealthy family and I am looking at a history book and then at the houses. I recognize the trees, oddly shaped like my doodles on paper, dry, old and broken. I am impressed with the houses and how wonderful they will look when refurbished. I realize I had forgotten, or chosen not to ride, my wheelchair and I walk back to get it. I stand for a while spacing out and then walk back to see the houses. I realize I had forgotten again to get my chair and walk back and open the passenger door and slide in. Lance rushes up and gets in the driver's side (Lance is black and used to be the city manager assistant to the disability rights city group). I am startled and then laugh as I had tried to slide across to the driver's seat, only he was there. I say, "Oh, I knew you had gotten in, but, out of habit, I was going to slide over to drive." He smiles and says he needs to take the car and go into town to find some information. I am a bit annoyed because he's not asking, just assuming it will be OK to appropriate my car, but I go along with it because it seems interesting. He drives and we talk companionably. He's married and talks about his children. We pull up to a redneck bar and walk in and lean up to the bar. A redneck man on our right says, "Well, well, look here. A lesbian, and a black man." I say, "Uh oh," and we start sidling out of the bar to avoid a fight. We quickly run to the car, and I lock the door on my side, check the lock in the back and unlock the driver's side for Lance. He hops in and almost hits a car parked nearby on the road. We go around it and drive fast. Soon we are in M City like country again and I see Native Americans putting up a tent or teepee. I say with regret, "I missed the powwow this year." Lance leans over and starts to kiss my sleeve affectionately in sympathy, but remembers he's married. I think the gesture is sweet. Lance decides he's going to drive to a man's house and get information on documents he wants. We pull up to a gate, near where the country fair is usually held, supposedly. An Indian man waves us to stop to be inspected. He points demandingly at where we should stop, on the gate like cow threshold. We do. I look up the road and see a group of mobster types eyeing us suspiciously. I say to Lance, "I'd better stay in my wheelchair (manual) so they won't get confused and suspicious." He agrees. We are given permission to enter to get the important information. (532 words)

I discover that huge quantities of water are pouring out of a protuberance like a belly button or vulva. I am concerned. I say, "Look, it's open like a flower, not curled in like a normal belly button." Merle is there and I share this weirdness with him. Then I look out the back kitchen window and see a makeshift chicken house, complete with chickens. I see a garden and a huge dog. I say, "Look, he's even bigger than Rover was!" I see Mary and Nancy and say that I am not happy. They shouldn't have done this to my back yard. At the very least, they should have asked permission first. Nancy's feelings are hurt because I said the chicken house was a shack and badly built. I also wondered what the neighbors would say, what with noisy and smelly animals around. I am not happy. I look out again and see a steep embankment and the whole farm thing is way in the back, more removed than before. It's not so bad that way. (177 words)

I am a school teacher visiting an Alaskan school. They have a conference like "Excellence in Teaching" and show me the books and materials. It is about body language, and I see moving pictures of how men lie down at their desk and it is powerful, but when women do it, it is tacky. The woman teacher I am visiting asks my opinion and I say hesitantly, "I taught over 20 years ago and this same thing came out then and now I find it sexist and outdated." She agrees. It's time for me to leave, but I had lent the books to other teachers so we go down the hall to see if I can get them back. I knew it would be this way. I see students and a few teachers in the hall. One teacher hands me some canceled tickets for H. Center performances. I thank her, thinking it is a good ticket I can use. Then I realize they are torn. Another teacher says, "I can fix that up for you so they will be usable again." We go to her school room. She also shares with me a phone number of some person who will change zeros in bank accounts so you can get more money. I know this is very illegal and decide not to use it, but I take it with me anyway, "just in case." Now I return to the original room I was in. Someone gives me an outfit to change into and pushes me into another room to change. I realize a young man will be coming by and I change to look pretty. I walk out and the teachers shove him into the room like matchmakers and leave. He wears a costume too. We are shy and standing close together. Then he kisses me and we "accidentally" fall onto the bed, kissing. The teachers let us sleep together the night and we make love. We are in love. The next morning I must go catch my plane and we start for the airport, sad but resigned; we hold hands. I see a view point up ahead where a magnificent waterfall is and I grab my camera to take some shots. We walk around the corner and I see the harbor. It is beautiful. I take a picture of the bridge structure like Y. Bay Bridge. It moves arts and is cute. Now we walk up slippery metal steps that are flat to get up to the well to see it spout. It is hard going and I say I can't make it. He encourages me and we do make it. As we wait for the spout, I realize I only have one more picture left on the roll and I want a picture of him to take with me, but I want one of the waterfall too, so we walk back down to put him in front of the waterfall. As I try to frame him in the shot, a beautiful dark- haired woman flirts with him and I try to keep her out of the picture. She laughs and says, "What's the matter, afraid of the competition?" I say, "No, go ahead, go for it," knowing he would stay true to me. I get a shot of him. Now we go on and suddenly he pulls me down a side street and takes off his police uniform. He's going to defect from the service and I'll stay in Alaska with him. (583 words)

I am walking and trying to find L College. I see railroad tracks and am undecided which way to go to get there more efficiently. I choose a street and see a big steep bike cement path that goes down a steep embankment and back up the other side over the tracks (like the street at the M City house). I wonder if I'll slip and fall, it is so steep, but I manage it. I see a domed building in the distance and recognize it as one of the L College buildings. I walk in that direction and find the administration building with a ramp and stairs and I can't decide at first which one to walk up. I go up the ramp and then some stairs. I want to sign up for more classes. Now I go to the M City House and want to take a bath, I am very tired. I had wondered how I managed to walk so far. I go into a room that has a tiny bathtub like a sink and try to fill it with hot water. I have trouble doing it, it gets too full, the water is cool and sticky. I release the plug and it goes out too quickly and I try again. Millie is there, sort of helping. I look out the sliding pocket door and see a crowd of people at the S's house and a policeman. I wonder what the commotion is all about. I see Jake's pickup and all four tires are flat and it is jacked up. Vandals, perhaps. My father is around. I go back in the bathroom and shut the door. I am aware a man is attracted to me and he stands just outside the door playing music for me. I see his eye as he peaks into a corner of the door. I try to shut it more. I wonder how I'm going to fit in the tub. I fill it to nearly overflowing. (334 words)

I am in a living room and Katrina and her grown daughter are having a serious talk in the bedroom. I hear their voices raised in intense emotion. I am trying to play some music on the stereo and can't find the right switch. I am annoyed and somewhat amazed because I've been turning it on for a year and now I don't know how. I am frustrated. I am also sad because an old boyfriend, maybe Nate, only with the name Michael, has a new girlfriend. Katrina comes out to help me turn on the music, but it's not working. I go into my room and now there is a wild dance party going on out in the living room and I don't want to join them. I stay in my room. Katrina finds some paintings and I want them put up on the wall. She finds two that are green and one is of the Simpsons, the TV cartoon family. Someone else like Kayla had done them for me. She puts them on my wall, even as I tell her I don't want them on the same wall as my own paintings. Oh well, I shrug, annoyed. Then they put up strips of ribbon left over from Katrina hosting some fund-raiser. They are yellow ribbons like 1st prize ribbons at a county fair. Sayings are written on them. Someone pastes them up with wall paper paste. I want to dance and decide now that everyone has left, as it is 5:00 in the morning, to put on my shoes. They're simple black pumps. Some old friend, like Arthur, comes by. He says he doesn't want to dance. I say, "fine," and continue putting my shoes on. He thinks I am ignoring him and want to dance with him. I don't want to dance with anybody. I just want to dance. Another man comes up, sort of Chicano, and calls me Cecilia and asks me to dance. He waits, as I try to get my straps buckled. Now I have five or six straps of different colors around my ankle and leg (left). He helps me buckle them, laughing. Now the shoe is a square cardboard box and I stuff towels in to keep it on. I go to the dance floor and skate around gracefully. It is fun and graceful. I enjoy. The music stops and I start singing the music and continue skating/dancing around. (407 words)

I am in a hospital room that doesn't really look like a hospital room. I had had two minor operations on my left foot and this morning I am going to go home. I see a huge bran muffin for my breakfast. Two other patients come in and dance for their exercise. They wear hospital gowns (one male and one female). They dance this a bit awkward like puppets on a string. I say, "At least the man has good-looking legs." A woman patient in another bed in my room complains she doesn't feel like dancing. I say, "Sure, it's good for you," and get out of bed to walk around the ward for a moment. I walk down the halls in a square and am amazed how well I feel, how much energy I have. I come back into the room excited about getting out of the hospital. A loudspeaker behind my head on the wall speaks. It is a man talking to me and I realize he's talking to the wrong customer (patient). I say angrily, "That's not me. My father's name is M and we lived in M City." I am angry that he mixed me up with someone else. Now my doctor is in the room, sort of a Michael J. Fox or Dr. Fleischman. I like him. He tells me I can't go home but must have another operation, this one a big one. I am angry at him now. Why didn't he tell me this before? He describes the operation. It will be on the right side of my head and will involve a fusion device sticking out of my head (like the one I had on left ankle). It will also involve my speech center for awhile. They will provide me with codes to use to communicate with until the speech returns. I say to him, "Well, are you sure you know what you're doing? You were working on my left foot and now you're doing my head!!" (335 words)

I am a man and work for a woman in a bank. She wants revenge on me for something she thinks I did. She pretends to be helpful and wants to publish my children's books. She creates a special book where the character is made into a doll and attached to the front cover of the book. But she comes back and says she needs some money to get it started and then will give it back soon. I empty my savings account and pay it. She smiles meanly because she's got me now. I'm basically a nice guy and she's starting to feel bad about what she's done to me. Now it's time to leave work and now I'm me, a woman. I join a huge crowd of people from Community College. I have my violin and play harmonizing notes with the singing crowd. I was asked to join the music department's violin group by Barbara, but don't think I'm good enough. I see Claude up ahead. He's riding a horse. I want to hang around him but the horse keeps stepping on my foot. I have to back away. Claude says he's going to the barn and rides on ahead. Now I see huge groups of people marching from another direction. We all meet at an intersection. One group announces their name and says they are really called "The Almost Political Marching Group." We laugh at their joke. The violin group is way behind in the crowd. We turn a corner and I run ahead to find a place to be. I see a door up ahead and think it's the barn and go in, looking for Claude. I hear him in there and see lambs cavorting around and then I decide to leave. I go back and see the violin group seated. I join them and they are luckily playing the Hungarian Dance #5 and I play along, amazed I can remember it so well and can still manage to play with my fingers as they are. It is fun. (343 words)

My house is filled with boxes of Terry's and I can't get around. I am concerned. I see she is packing things out of the house and I go around back and see down out a window that she has taken two of my crocheted afghans. I holler down, "Hey, Sue, Susan," I can't remember her name, like it's Ellie's roommate sunny. I go quickly around to the font door to call out, saying to Ellie, "She may take the TV set, but that's not so bad, I have insurance." Ellie says she's more worried she'll take the food, considering the problem she has with weight. "Oh, I never thought of that," I say. It wouldn't be so bad. I'd not be reimbursed, but it's not so much a loss. I go down the hall and some woman agrees with me that I have been gaining a lot these past five years and it really shows. I walk away from her saying, "See, I knew that but people wouldn't tell me the truth. I hate aging!" (176 words)

I am a man comedian and waiting to be on star search or something like that. I get on stage with a Barbie doll and I am screamingly funny. "How would you like to look at this?? Did your parents like them too? An anorexia doll. But the boys had a different point of view; they liked it." The audience roared. Now I'm a woman comedian and very funny. Afterward, the man and I go to a coffee shop to celebrate our success. I want to see a woman actress who is doing a play there. The helper woman comes by and says to me, "He's been chosen, but you're a woman and they are still considering you." I get nervous, wondering if I made it. She suggests I go back to Jack Benny's office and wait at his door all night if necessary. I return, crawling up green venetian blinds and it is very precarious and I could have lost my hand grip and fallen, but I make it and turn it into a funny routine. I find my doll and special animal I used in my act and am very happy to be reunited with then. I hug them and talk to them. The helper woman tells me to wait until the light goes on this stage and then go out and perform again for Mr. Benny. She steps out to test the stage, which is a bit rickety as she is several hundred pounds. I go out and begin adlibbing. Men come out and I work them into the act. I am very funny, powerful, and weigh 300 lbs. I do a dance routine with one guy to show how an overweight woman can be seen as sexy and fully a woman. I grab one man by the hair during our routine and he winces, very impressed with my power. I say, "I used to be a wrestler." I see my body as muscular and huge. Then Mr. Benny Jackson comes on stage and we sit in a circle and we are in awe of him. He has a tiny clown nose and is old and sweet. We applaud him. Then I applaud the woman helper who is also a comedian and tell her I couldn't have made it if she hadn't been out there when it was time for me to go on and do my show the first time. I told her I was having a hard time managing to keep in control the adrenaline of fear and excitement and wanted to keep as much flexible control as I could so I didn't totally lose it out there on stage, and seeing her there, already a successful comedian and a woman helped me.

I put an ad in the paper announcing that I will be teaching math class and I am getting ready to do that. I have a pile of notes and magazine articles cut out. I am in a house, perhaps Ginny and Ernie's. I am in the kitchen and Ginny is around. Now she is crying and upset because Ernie just came over to tell her that the guys at work say she's a cold, rigid bitch and can't do anything. She is very hurt and I say I'm really surprised at Ernie for saying this to her. It was a mean thing to do. Ernie seems to agree with them that she is incompetent. The boys are cooking and cleaning because she would ruin the dinner. Ernie hangs around, inquisitive about what I'm planning to do. I feel scared, I've taken on more than I can manage. I see it is 9:10 in the evening and hear the doorbell. I go to open the door and my father is there shaking hands. I shake the hand of the first man student and say, "Come on into the other room where my notes are set up on the piano." And they can sit on the couch, and Ernie is seated in a comfy chair in a corner, nearby. My father says anybody with FBS's in their names are well received, meaning they all have high math degrees. Now I'm really nervous and politely offer cookies and snacks and they go into the kitchen to get some. I say to Ernie with a look of appeal in my eyes, "If you want to be my assistant and help me out, I'd sure appreciate it." He grins. He'd rather watch me squirm. He says Tessa says it's a bit weird to be getting instruction from a girlfriend. I start looking through my pile of notes and read the articles, hoping to pull myself together and be organized. I remind myself I am here to teach math from a humanistic point of view, not just straight math. I see an article showing three newborn babies and the article is about how the doctors are always looking for number 200 (the special child). They come in and sit down, expectant. I nervously smile and hope for the best. I wish I'd never been so foolish as to assume I could teach this. I suggest we all work on this material together. We'll learn from each other. I hope they don't get mad at me and think I'll give them back their fee if they feel I didn't interest them or teach them anything useful. (440 words)

I am at a cafeteria and am going to get something to eat. I stand and they put my wheelchair over to the side. My official helper is a retarded man who very seriously wants to help me the best he can. He clutches me around the middle from behind and drags me from food station to food station, hanging on to me diligently. It is uncomfortable. A retarded woman is the supervisor and asks if I want a hamburger. I say yes. She slaps down a pathetic white bread bun and calls for my server, Linda, also retarded. She asks what I want on my second burger and I think I say catsup and mayonnaise, but she says they are out of one of the seven commandments. She tells me which one, like it's a cucumber or something. I say, "No, I said mayonnaise." I turn a corner and someone is complaining he has his bunting pan in a box and the people there have been too rough on it in storage and broke it. A woman complains she's in charge of the emotionally weird section, meaning the retarded people. I am offended by her patronizing attitude. I am annoyed at him as I examine the box, because the box is so flimsy and it is really faulty. Now I am watching a demonstration of blind people weaving mesh together with their bare hands. They stand between two screen door-like mesh screens and run their hands over it like they were playing a harp and it weaves them together. I am impressed. It looks like it would hurt. I go outside to talk with their counselor or supervisor, a nice young man. He is looking at a children's book with my name in it. He says things have improved here since last year when I visited. I say, "You should have seen the patronizing attitude of this lady who worked with the retarded people. I notice my own attitude is patronizing. (332 words)

Willie has died and I am attending his funeral. He will be visiting us during the ceremony as a hologram and I am very curious to see how realistic this will be. I sit up front and see three empty chairs to the right where high school friend Dora and Aunt Esther will sit. Behind me are the rows of seats for the others. Then Dora sits next to me on the right. Esther is wandering among the many people in the audience section and she is announcing that Willie would have liked us to dance to his favorite music. She puts on a 50's rock and roll record and we all stand and dance, me crying sadly as I dance. I see the hologram of Willie and watch his eyes for contact. Dora cries too. After two songs, we sit, and now each person opens the gift they brought to Willie and I watch and exclaim, "What's that?" to one man. He says it's a set of golf clubs. I see five boxes on top of each other, each one a set of golf clubs. Willie liked to play golf. I wonder how this is helpful, to give clubs to a dead man. Maybe Dora can sell them and get something she can use. I see I've given him one golf club. Now there is a small boy, a midget, really, who wonders if the tooth fairy is real. I tell him a story about how I waited for the tooth fairy and I saw movement near the window, like I was telling a ghost story or Santa Claus story. He is enthralled with me. I am semi-teasing him. His father says, "You really liked her story, why don't you tell her?" He turns bright red in the face and I wonder if he'll be OK, maybe have a stroke or something. Now he's a midget man. He tries to tell me he really liked my story. (328 words)

I want to talk with a sheep who lays down like she wants her tummy rubbed like Fluffy. A sheep dog/wolf keeps moving in between us to prevent us from talking. I decide to respect the dogs obvious wishes because I don't want to get hurt. Later, the dog says, "Oh, I guess you really aren't done talking yet," and moves aside so we can talk. I thank her.

I am at the lower levels and there are scary things around, ugly things, monsters maybe. I decide to go upstairs to heaven. I walk upstairs and try to see prettier things, like angels, and fairies, I think. I manage to create foggy clouds and leaves. "It's either fog or blue sky up here," I think. I am crying. something about healing. The people up there are going to do surgery on my feet. They begin and I feel queasy because there is no anesthetic and I might feel pain. I am aware that I won't feel pain if my mind is positive and believes it. I am worried I'll forget that in the middle of the surgery. They do my right foot and are working on my left foot. I am cradled by Katrina and Lucy, who rock me and soothe me and I cry. I am happy I am being healed. (153 words)

It is time to do voice studio work and people are late. I am singing a song with Doug and I am pleased to notice I sing well and in harmony. Lucy is there. We nearly finish the song. There are two more lines to go and we decide to stop for the day. Barry asks if he's needed tomorrow and I say yes. Sherina comes in and it is 6 o'clock, not 3 o'clock as I wanted. Dino comes in late. I am annoyed and ask what happened. Dino is standing and very tall and I ask him to sit down so I can talk to him without hurting my neck. He sits and now I look at a reflection of his face in a metal mug. I pick up a calculator-like thing and push a button out of curiosity. A male voice comes on a message machine from a bank. I can't get it to stop. I push buttons, read directions, etc. and can't figure it out. I ask them and they try. I look for Doug. He will know but he's eating an apple and walking down some stairs. I go to the top of the stairs and look down. I see he's dropped his brief case in the green ocean water in the room below and he is swimming, while still biting on his apple, to get it. I hope he's OK because he's partially blind. He feels his way out, pushing aside the fallen leaves. I wonder how come the water is allowed in the room; the nice wood floor will get ruined. He comes back and I turn and walk back in, not wanting him to know I watched. I now pick up a baby and notice it has hair in its mouth. I pull some out, wondering if the baby bites people's hair and then can't spit it out. I find more and more, deeper down the throat, and realize the baby gets hairballs like a cat and we have to get that out of there. (343 words)

Dwight was sad because he lost his girlfriend who is an invisible spirit or an alien. Her name is Clara or Laura. She comes and gets him and I am happy for him. There are aliens pursuing me. I grab a rope with heavy things on each end of it and swing it back and forth, smashing it from one wall to the next or rather from the left side of me to the right side of me, knocking at the aliens. This doesn't stop them. One runs at me and I catch him by the legs and he falls. Now I run and one chases me. I know I can't outrun him, so I suddenly throw myself to the ground and he can't stop fast enough and falls. I get up and run more, and see a secret place to hide and crawl in. I was earlier taking pictures with my camera. I saw a flying turkey vulture and a big one and a baby one roosting together. The images were compelling and strong. I felt happy to be able to take the pictures with my camera. (188 words)

I had made love to my "husband" who is like Richard L of playwriting class. I go into the bathroom to pee and realize this will be an opportunity to take a look at my husband's penis, which I now wear. I peer down into the toilet bowl, as I am seated on it and see a small weeny hung suspended by a hair, like it was a bowel movement. I gingerly pull at the hair until it all falls into the toilet bowl. I look again and see a small penis. I expected as much - small -- a bit disappointed. I see another bowel movement come out. It is soft. I then look again at the penis. It is bigger and I think, "Oh, am I getting an erection?" I think that would be fun or interesting. I am curious. I look again and it is a bit bigger, still semi-flaccid and has a fingernail at the end of it. "No wonder," I think, "that it felt funny when it was in me." The sensation wasn't painful, just interesting. I pee and pee and l look again and see a few blood spots and remember I haven't had periods for years now. Maybe I'm spotting. I feel a compelling need to pee and get annoyed with myself and say to myself, "Go ahead, let it go." I do. (230 words)

I am in a room and a huge monarch butterfly is flying around. I think it is beautiful. It lands on my right wrist. I am excited, but a little nervous as it is a live insect and so big. At first it is interesting, but I get more nervous as it wriggles around and around and wraps itself around my wrist like it is spinning a cocoon. I see several crawly bugs, like its larva, and I get a bit panicky and want it off before this gets out of control. I don't want to touch it myself and run into another room where "Benny" is lying on the floor with an injured, bloody leg, perhaps shot or broken. Next to him is Burt Lancaster, who I ask to remove the butterfly. I caution him to be careful and not hurt the creature. He is rough and rips it from my wrist. It is torn and crumpled. He plops it on a table. I feel relieved it is off me and sad it is hurt. (176 words)

Now I am the injured person from the previous dream and go outside. I see a flying machine and I am in a helicopter thing. We fly around but have to be careful not to hit the telephone wires. There are wires everywhere, this being city blocks. Then we move on down the street and I see a huge expanse of blue sky. It feels freeing and we joyfully head on out. Now I see a person who, when her feet hit the ground and lift up for the next step, daisies and other pretty wild flowers grow up instantly. I realize she is the healing person I've been needing and looking for. I follow her inside and she lays her hands on my head (the left side as I am facing her, so it's really the right side). I am cured and feel great. Now there is a cute baby girl following me and wants to play. We sing songs together. I sing wonderful harmony to "Hush little baby, don't you cry." Some woman behind me and behind a glass wall partition watches and is pleased. I am happy I have pleased her. Now the baby wants her medicine and doesn't want the regular stuff, but the special elixir I got from this place. (215 words)

I am with Ernie and Ginny at some sort of concert and am walking down a gravel aisle in the bleachers. I am looking for pretty rocks and find three. I show them to Ernie, who is impressed. The first one is a single line of quartz crystals in a row. The second one is a geode kind of thing with a hole in it with crystals inside, and a third one has unusual and pretty things in it. Now I am going back up the bleachers and I see Cary Grant, who is offended by a man's political statement and Cary uses his left arm to throw a punch at him. "How Male!" I say sarcastically and witheringly. He walks down the bleachers and I follow, almost slipping on the carpeted steps. (133 words)

I am going through boxes of old things from my business, which is now officially my daughter's business. I am looking for something and I check things off as I find them. I find the name "Barb's" has been changed and think I've found evidence, and then I remember she legitimately bought the business and so it is natural she would change the name. I change my outfit seven times to be exact replicas of seven past women to make her remember. Howard is in his office and she is in hers and they both ignore me but are very aware of me. It's time to leave, the end of the day. I go out to the car with her, very pleased that she was aware of all seven women, right down to the smell. I realize Howard hasn't joined us and I know he's trying to commit suicide and my daughter arranged it. I confront her and demand the key to his office. She says she hasn't got it. I prove she has and further I have one and I go back and open the door to find him nearly dead with pills. We take him to the hospital and save him. (203 words)

I am a doctor/physical therapist and work with children. I am loving and touch their faces in a loving way and this is their therapy. Now I have to go to a staff meeting or conference and I am very annoyed because this takes up my time from my patients. I find the room and go through the double doors and see a table where three or four doctors (male) are already seated. I choose to sit away from them at the nearest end to the speakers. If I have to be there, I want to be most efficient and not waste time. The head doctor at the speakers' table is Capt. Kirk and as a joke he walks over to me to give me a long kiss. I am annoyed. Why waste time playing around? The male doctors make fun of me for being so business minded. (148 words)

I am at a woman's shop looking for an outfit to wear. The place is also sort of a kid's school area and it's a mess. I pick up a container of play dough and throw it away. The woman owner says, "Well, I suppose it's OK now, but it was helpful to have lots of that when we started." I realize I had acted automatically and shouldn't have. I apologize. She says, "Why don't you tell anyone you were in education? Is it a secret?" I say, "No, not really, it's just that if I tell them, they will expect me to teach and be in charge. I don't want that now. I'm tired of it." She understands. I have a blouse and pants and go into a restroom to try them on. I am in a toilet stall where there is lots of water on the floor and I lay them in the water, accidentally. I realize what I did and pick them back up. I want to try them on to see if the size will be OK and then I'll take them off and dry them out. It will be difficult and tiring, but I really need to know if they will fit and look OK. I notice the button down shirt looks like a man's shirt and the young boy says, "Oh, that will have to be done by the valet. You'll have to make an appointment." I don't want to wait, so I ask him if he will be my "valet" for now and help me out. He kindly agrees. I notice the shirt is very long, like a dress. It fits well. Now I try the pants and struggle with the wet trousers. I get them on and notice how thick my middle is, but the pants will fit. I then hear the voice of my soon-to-be husband as he is trying to come in to try out his outfit. I am surprised he doesn't notice this is a women's room and wonder for a moment if I got in the wrong room, but other women (and men) are there. He comes in, not seeing me. He is good-looking with blonde hair. (369 words)

I watch, and sort of am, a wife with a 2-year-old toddler who gets into everything, messes up her toys and refuses to help pick them up. The wife is angry and tired and insists the child help clean up. I/her pick up the child and carry her screaming to a day care center or a time out place. She is throwing a temper tantrum. The husband, sort of Nate, is annoyed and unwilling to help out. I act as a mediator and am very tolerant of his traditional male views that women's job is in the home and man's work is outside the home. I try to reason with them both. Someone cries and cries in grief. (118 words)

I am moving around in some kind of dance that moves purple colored sands around in patterns. After I am done, someone says, "How very beautiful a voice she has." Someone else (male) says, "Yes, we all have beautiful voices. But after they become aware of it, they change and can't do it as well." I feel like saying, "But no, I can continue to be beautiful after I'm aware." The man says, "Well, I invite you to partake of a new game. This one is going to be finished soon." I don't want it to be finished, because I do it well. He wants me to move on and try something new and challenging. (115 words)

I am in a room and the scene keeps changing times and people. Now I am watching a scene of my mother's family when Millie was about 8 years old. I ask where is Millie and someone (my mother) points to the couch where she is lying down because she is sick with the croup. She has on glasses like I wore when 6 years old. I am handed Millie's old diary and I try to read it in anticipation. This will be very interesting. I keep finding printed stories and instructions on how to keep a diary, but none of her own words. Later, my father asks me if I ever do research on a general question for people and I say, "Sometimes." He says he's interested in "extroverts" and I say I have lots of info on that. He says he is particularly interested in it as related to rheumatoid arthritics. (153 words)

I am going up in an airplane, high, high up, and coming straight down and then learning to pull out before you crash on the ground. I like this experience. Then I land and my "husband," like Bud of the movie "The Abyss," comes over. We go to his place of work, like the counseling department, only in an auditorium setting. He introduces me to the secretary, a large, fat woman and she offers me some potato chips, left over from a welcoming party given for my husband and me. She says to my husband, "Welcome," but she can't come to the party. She can wait in the lounge. My husband is insulted. We leave in a huff. He does take me to the lounge after I say it's OK. The other wives are there and welcome me. We poke around the things there left by our husbands. There are lots of little desk objects like pen sets with little statues on them. A woman's leg and a tower on the same stand. We laugh at this theme as it is on several husband's desks. I want to go to work, but it's clear I'm not wanted. So the wives go in and one says, "Come with me." I don't care, so I follow her. We find an area where not many people are. We are going to write songs together. It's part of the work. She does the music and me the lyrics or she the lyrics and me the music. Jerome comes by. He's the boss and wants to know why we don't sit down where the others are. Later I am driving down a street (maybe M City) and look in an open window and see a small girl, the daughter of my old boyfriend, and wonder if he can give me my truck and I can drive it home today, since I'm back in town this Saturday morning.

I am going to go on vacation, and swim and have a good time, but somehow I get taken as a prisoner by the Arabs and taken to a desert fort made of thick adobe walls. I think, "If it keeps raining a lot, it will all melt away and there will be no prison." Fat chance. A woman takes all my vacation money and acts like it's hers. She's an Arab guard, or something. I'm in trouble, and I don't really know it yet. She says because I was captured in the IS. Galopadoes (meaning island galapadoes), they will incarcerate me in that section. I'm being put away for a long time! (113 words)

I decide, somewhat hastily, to marry this Native American man. I don't know him very well, but I've always wanted a Native American man, so I do it. Jake and Valerie are late for the wedding; I wear a beautiful gown. There is an old boyfriend who comes and dances with me to some jazz music after the ceremony and we dance well. Then the husband tries to dance with me and he appears thin and awkward, but we dance anyway. I like him and hope this all works out. Now we lay down to make love; we are excited. The single hospital-like bed is near a huge window with no curtains and the double dutch door is opened. I think to the door to close, and the bottom half closes and two locks snap closed and I have trouble getting the top part closed. Then the kisses on my neck become huge bites of a monster leaving a huge, bloody wound. I don't want this and I refuse to accept the image and force it back to kisses and sexual enjoyment. He kisses my breasts and I feel very sexually pleasured. Now the time is up and I can return to the real world I had left, only if I do I can not return to this one and will lose the husband, who I like. I decide to stay with him. We sit on a couch and listen to jazz musicians. Another woman, another me, returns through a door and feels alone. (254 words)

I am teaching a class and Darryl is one of the students. I like him just like I did in high school. We dance together and hold hands and I wonder if the other students will be upset or think this is unethical. After all, I did know him when I was a teen. As we are walking together toward the door, I say to him, with loving anticipation, "Will I see you at lunch?" He says curtly, "No," and walks away. I feel devastated and hurt. I love him and want him to want me. (96 words)

I am interviewing a new roommate who has two small children. I say to her that I want to make it clear that she should not expect me to be available to babysit. I am a writer and need lots of alone and quiet time, maybe for a half hour now and again, but otherwise, arrange for someone else. She's a bit annoyed. Then the children come in. It's early in the morning. I see a man who has hand puppets and he's grilling hamburgers on a portable grill and doing a puppet show. Foxy Fox puppet. The kids want to buy a hamburger; they are hungry. I say, "No, come into the kitchen, I'll get you some breakfast." I find a loaf of white bread and offer to make them toast and milk. I decide to have some myself and cringe a bit at the white bread, but decide this once it's OK. I find two slices already toasted and decide to warm them up for myself. We return to the living room and I think, "See, this is what I mean; here it is too early in the morning and I have to be up to watch those kids." Now it's time to go to work and the boss is giving everyone their assignments. A man is supposed to deliver packages of parts. He comes up to me and waits. I say, "What?" He says, "You're supposed to pay me." I say, "Wait." I look around for Bill, the boss. "Might know it," I say, "when you need him, he's gone." I call for him and he comes in and I say, "This guy wants to be paid." He writes up an invoice. Now I need a ride back to the main area, so we walk together over to the driver's area. Two or three old men are walking toward us and one says, "Will you look at her form?" "What a sexist remark," I think and come back sassily with, "and I suppose you are amorphous?" I am very pleased with my witty remark and tell it to the man with me and he's laughing. Now I find the drivers. I walk down a steep embankment through a crowd of people gathered to watch some event or construction job. I see ropes on the ground and ask what they are for. I see men working down the hill with the ropes. I move fast and wonder if I might have been better off taking the more gentle slope further on, but I make it and find the rows of bikes at the "bike pool" (like a motor pool). Patsy is a bike driver and I decide to get a ride with her back to the main terminal. I look at the pink bike and say, "But where do I sit?" I hope there's a seat. I see a double seat, side by side, like sidesaddle. I get on and have some concern about where to hold on so it doesn't seem like I have my arm around Patsy. She gets on and off we go down the bike lane of the freeway. I wonder if she's good enough to keep balance. I wonder if I know how to relax and keep balance. We chat. She tells me of her mother having another relationship with this kind of man who beats her or something bad. I say, "Oh yes, people repeat their patterns." I'm not surprised, then Patsy turns off the road toward a snow field and a large bump. She plows on ahead and just as we crest the top of the bump. I look down and see we are about to plunge off the precipice into a grand canyon-like dropoff. We are dead and in terror, we turn desperately and by some miracle, we actually avoid falling. We are stunned and shocked and hurriedly move away back to the road. We would have been killed. I said, "Someone wants us alive," meaning God. "Thank you," we pray fervently. We vow to look and be more careful from now on. We are so grateful and humbled by the experience. Pat says, "I'll bet this one goes in the dream book!" Somewhere in the dream I look at photos and see one of Pat and Amy cooking something in a kitchen and looking at the camera like someone had just called their names and they looked up, seeing the camera and mugs for it, surprised.

I am in a house and Howard is there and I realize I'm late for an appointment in Roseburg and I get up and rush around to go. Howard, in the kitchen, in exasperation, says, "Why don't we just get over this part and settle down and do things together? You like to swim and I like to golf." I smile wryly at Katrina who is listening to this as if to say, "I don't believe I'm hearing this." I feel like saying, "But I don't want to spend time with you, that's why." He's going out the back door and I don't bother to respond to him and hurry out the front, slipping on the stair and it tips over as I walk down it and falls. I haven't time to pick it up and rush on to the garage. I see Howard's taxi leaving and he is still muttering angrily in frustration. (154 words)

I am in a room, like maybe a big lecture hall and I am curiously looking around. I see nearly everyone sleeping, sitting up. People are cuddled together like Charla and me in my chair. One person is holding the other like I hold Charla. One boy had a beard and mustache, but he was just a boy. He slept like a child. I enjoy looking around me and seeing things. I am aware I am dreaming. (77 words)

I am a manager of a baseball team and I want the star player to go out and greet the audience, which is in a brick building. He is shy and unwilling and I am very forceful. I grab him by his arms and lean into him and speak loudly. I strongly encourage him to go out and do it. A man is watching and is impressed with me. I tell the player the audience will love him. I point to the building and say, "They will go crazy with applause." I then push the player out to the field and I hear the crowd screaming and cheering. (108 words)

I am all dressed up in a pretty dress. I walk out through a party with many people and feel shy. I continue through the crowd and walk down some stairs to a quiet, unpeopled place. I see a man, with balding head, but good-looking and in a white navy dress uniform. He likes me very much and I am happy to see him. We dance a slow, romantic dance and it is a passionate moment where I feel filled with intense love and desire for him, not sexual, but LOVE. He feels the same way, but he is being proper and not allowing us to kiss, even though I pucker up and offer a kiss. I want to be united with him forever and it's horrible pain to think he may leave me. We walk arm in arm and hug. (141 words)

I am running to help, wounded as the gunfire and machine gun fire is all around me. I leap over two brick walls to get to them. I try to fix their wounds. Then I see a cardboard box and realize a baby is in there. I pull off layer after layer of cardboard some with writing on it from the baby's mother, I finally find the baby in a plastic molded container like she was a doll. I take her out and feel immense relief for her. I hold her and kiss her and hug her, knowing she had a very traumatic time in the dark and want her to feel loved and whole. She has short cute blonde hair and wears a blue jammie. She is happy and not badly traumatized by her experience. [BL] (136 words)

I am walking down a sidewalk and a homeless woman lies down and wraps herself in a black blanket to my left. I stand there and look at her. It seems she did this deliberately so I will notice her. I see she has the blanket wrapped tightly around her and over her head because it is very cold outside. I look at her exposed feet in moccasin shoes and watch to see if she is shivering. She isn't. I choose to walk away from her, feeling a bit guilty for not trying to help. [BL] (95 words)

I am moving and packing my things. Paulina is a little girl and I am surprised as I remember she really is 21 years old now. I find miniature things left behind. I tell someone to pull off the blue paper off the wall I used as a decoration. They do it, but also take down the backing on a huge cork board. It's a mess. I see a picture I want to keep. Now I am moving into the new house. There are some stairs that need ramping. An L-shaped hall with the rooms all in a row down the halls. I see a pretty living room at the end of one hall and a fireplace. I go look out the window and see a river nearby with beavers swimming pulling a log. I call to my mother and say, "Come see the beavers pulling a log." I am surprised the river is so close by. My father comes in to help me unpack. (165 words)

I am packing my things, little pretty glass things and figurines and trying not to take too many with me to the new place. I have a hard time resisting them and pack them up. A woman client of mine comes and starts telling me her current crisis and I half listen and then say, "Excuse me, but I'm busy right now, could you wait a few moments?" She sits on a couch and I go into another room looking on the top of the refridge for more of my things. I am annoyed that she is bothering me and annoyed I didn't just tell her to go away. I see what looks like a tiny figurine of a blue heron and pick it up (on top of refridge) and it turns out to be a fat dragon plastic figurine with a silly face. Oh, it's my mothers. I go to another refridge, where the door is part way open because the shelves in the door are part way out. I think someone is cleaning it. My father says, "No, it's OK," and shoves them back in place. I step up on a step chair too far up on the rungs and my balance is precarious. I back down a few rungs and feel better. Then I see a man, and my client goes to him and I realize I'd told her he's a good man and will help her, so she's get off my back. The first thing the man (like Pete Allgiere) does is kiss her and I feel bad. I start to go over to stop this and the woman comes to me. I signal her to come closer and she does, holding open a book and she says, "Look, your book." I see she or the man has made an illustration out of part of my book (a thing about different kinds of plants). I feel pleased and unsure whether to pursue warning her the man is not as I thought he was. She seems content to return to him and I let go and don't do anything more. (353 words)

A huge double trailer truck parks in a way that protects the handicapped parking space for me. He likes me and is trying to help. I pull the van up in the graveled spot, glad he is helping me. I get out and am walking and see the ocean on my left. I notice a huge wave gathering up and realize I'd better get moving quickly. I walk quickly uphill, now the trucker is on my left and my mother is on my right. We walk and I feel tired and achy. This is hard work for a person out of shape. The wave comes over us, totally immersing us and I think I'll die and won't be able to hold my breath long enough. Then I notice I can breathe and realize we had made it up high enough for safety.

Marci is noisy and bothersome. She won't stop talking and I am very upset. My friends Mirabelle and Lucy (maybe Rochelle as well) agree to kill her for me. It seems the only way to shut her up. I hesitantly agree. I want her to stop, but I feel squeamish about doing it myself. So they shot her with a gun and she falls. Now we have to get rid of the body, but I notice she's not dead yet. She's still breathing. One of my friends puts her on my bed while she goes looking for something to finish her off with. I feel real dread at being so close to her. She stares out vacantly, breathing. I feel sick, being so near her. I start to feel remorse. First she felt ill anyway, and now we've added the pain of a bullet and blood. Someone suggests we give her an overdose of pain killers so she'll be free of the pain and finally die. I agree and then I feel bad and decide it's best to turn ourselves in with her so she can get help. It was wrong to try to kill her. I agree to take the full blame and I say I will tell the authorities that I killed her and shot the gun myself. That way my friends won't get in trouble for trying to help me. They don't know what to do. [BL] (239 words)

I hear a punk boy pounding on my door and I am angry at him. I open the door and yell at him to stop it and leave me alone. He is mean and refuses to stop. He seems to enjoy my anger. That's why he's doing this. I try to keep the door locked, but he keeps pushing it open and the door isn't very strong. So I open the door, grab the kid by the hair and slap him on the face, bite him on the forehead and in general try to beat him into submission. It doesn't work, of course, and I drag him by the ear to his mother's, across town in the bad section. It becomes clear they don't give a damn, and not only are they not going to help me, they are going to make it worse by being vengeful. (147 words)

I am sitting on Abner's lap and we are lovey-dovey. We are going to get married. We are at a hotel, room #72. It's time to clean up from breakfast and I decide to clean up the dishes and utensils for Abner and me. I realize this is very wife-like and I say to Abner, smiling, "I'm only going to do this three times a year." I don't want him to think this will be normal operating procedures! I take a pile of utensils to the kitchen area and ask where to put them. I realize I could have left all this for the staff, seeing as how we paid for our room. The staff is already coming into the room to prepare it for the next guests. Now I get to choose a free gift and I'm looking at some pages to see what's available. I can't make much sense out of the words and there aren't any pictures. I see a wooden book holder with a light and a magnifying glass to read books more easily. I like that. Someone shows me one without varnish and it has two dishes with a pink liquid in it. I decide to take that one. (204 words)

I own a huge house or apartment building and now have lots of renters, who have broken the hinges on my K-mart special appliances. It is time to eat and I seem to have a husband and a son. I go to the glass doors of a freezer unit, like in a store, only it's for home, and open the door, angry that the door isn't properly shut and the food could spoil. I get a hunk of frozen hamburger meat out of a Costco-like package. I take it to my husband who makes patties out of it in the shape of sleeping people, their heads resting on the hamburger buns. I decide that I'll charge each renter $5 a month on upkeep of the appliances and need to start collecting the money. I shout to them to come on over and start paying. I have a clipboard with lots of forms and papers and I struggle to find the right one so I can record who paid. One older man hasn't paid his rent and I'm trying to get that too. It's a lot of work and I'm not enjoying this experience. (193 words)

I am for some reason taking my Masters in Counseling again. I'm near completion but don't seem to want to finish. I can't figure out why I would do this. What's the purpose? I have a rich father and am estranged from him and need to find my own place to live and he's fighting it. Finally I look up to a cave in the side rock wall and say that's where I need to live. Everyone is glad I've finally seen that. My father's wife is happy for me. I go up there to look it over. There are windows and a swarm of mosquitoes are in there, and then they fly out through the small square openings under the windows that look like tiny windows themselves. I say, "I'll have to remember to stand up and see the view, because it is so breathtaking and inspirational." Then I go downstairs to find the kitchen. William Riker is my friend and he's glad I've finally found my niche, my place. I go into the kitchen and see my female roommate, who is lesbian. I see her standing, doing the dishes with her arm around her girlfriend and I feel relief. It's her girlfriend. I am not lesbian. We are not obligated to be girlfriends. I turn and walk away. I see a crowd and hear Curtis Salgoto playing his blues harp. I am standing behind Curtis Salgoto as he plays his blues harp to the crowd, and I play with him on my harp, trying to impress him. Finally he turns and walks up close to me in a sexy way and leans in and says, "OK, you're not bad, now stop shadowing me and let me play." He smiles. I then lean into him and caress his hair with my left hand. I smile in a sexy way and say, "Someday, when you're not so arrogant, you'll really hear me and know I'm as good as you are." He smiles and turns and plays to his adoring audience. I walk away, around the corner to my part of the room under the "egg hole" I live in now and start rehearsing with my band. I play and play and rehearse. Curtis is walking past the place I'm rehearsing to go out the door and he hears me and stops to listen. He is very impressed. He sneezes and tries to hide, because he doesn't want me to know he heard. I come out to the hall and say "Who's that that sneezed?" I see him. I say, "Did you sneeze?" He turns, a sheepish grin on his face and says yes. "You heard me?" I ask. He says, "Yes. You're as good as I am." He says it with grudging admiration. I am so happy. I say to my band men as they are walking past to go home, "Did you hear that?" He says "Yeah, he said you are as good as he is." I grin. Curtis pulls out a paperback book which is his wallet and says to the guy, "Do I have anything in this wallet that will make you forget you ever heard that?" The guy grins and takes the wallet and leaves. Curtis leans against the wall, pulls me into an embrace and we stand there, pleasantly hugging. (555 words)

I have two or three more dreams this morning where the relationship with Curtis continues. We are lovers and can't get enough of each other. He asks how often we'll have sex and I say, "As often as you like." I want him all the time and he me. We are on tour with the band. The boys of his band are not happy I'm around, but tolerate me because they have no choice. We sleep, make love, and sleep again. It never seems to stop. We are together constantly. I am happy. I take some of my children's books to the librarian in this town we play at. I tell her what the other librarian had said about my books not being professionally done and what the problems are. I wonder why I do this. She won't want to buy, but it seems important to be honest. In the later dream, I go around the rooms asking where he is; I want to watch him creating a story because I can learn from this. I enter a room where the boys of the band are watching TV and ask if he's there. One says yes. I see him laying on the floor watching a movie he's made. He looks over to see our reactions to his acting. I go lay down to watch with him and notice I lay down a few feet away from him. This is the first time in our intense relationship where some small distance was OK. I move a drying toddler's outfit off a wire and lay it on the floor so I can see the TV better. I feel it (it's corduroy material) to see if it's dry. It is. Earlier a woman came to sing for him. She's good and I take her videotape to him. Her older mother or manager says a word that sounds Native American as her name. Maybe there is Marci energy in her as well. I wonder if it is smart of me to introduce her to my man Curtis.

I am going to live in a room with a roommate. Hasani is the director of whatever owns that room, like maybe the university. She comes in to tell me some changes that are going to happen. The good news is that the room will be fixed up structurally. There are gaps under and above the door jam and such. The bad news is that some of the furnishings are going. My white kitchen table is going. "Not that one," I say. I need something there to hold my toast and breakfast things; otherwise I'd have to carry it across the room. "Well, someone can help you do that," says Hasani. I am shocked she'd say that. "I can't believe you would say that," I say. I begin to cry in my frustration. She says, embarrassed, "Don't cry. Black people don't cry." I say angrily, "I'm not black!" and continue to cry. She then says they want my piano, an old upright. She doesn't know what to do, because what if a disabled group like Silvi wants it. It's not fair. A boy comes in and puts flowers in a metal vase on a dining table. I grudgingly say thank you to him, after he leaves. I sleep on a couch that could be made into a bed, but choose not to go to that trouble. All the furnishings are a bit ratty. (233 words)

I am seated on a high contraption seat that is on a cart (tea cart like table on wheels). Jake starts taking it apart so it doesn't sit so high. I decide to go to the bathroom and a man follows me to the door. I shut the gauze curtain door and think about locking the door but don't because I might insult or offend the man. I then sit on the toilet which looks a lot like Rena's wheelchair. I am slumped like she is. Then the man returns and wants in, peeking through the curtain. I am angry at him and tell him to go away. I'm glad I'm clothed so he can't see anything. My mother comes in and I comment on her sunburned face. It is bright red but only in parts. A swirl around her cheeks is still white. Lydia is there and I ask her how old she is now. She says, "13." I think, "Oh oh, I'm glad she's going back home with Mom." The teen years are hard. I remember I didn't know her during her teen years because I married and moved away. Then, Jake and Dwight are setting up a garage sale and I go out to see what we're selling: lots of lawn mowers, and lots of beautiful glass vases. The vases are my mother's and they are beautiful. I think of buying them but they are too expensive: $280, $40, etc. They are too much to ask for at a garage sale. (254 words)

I need to go to the bathroom and go looking for a bathroom. I don't find one and have to go badly. I bend down near a fireplace in a sort of church lobby/activity room. I am standing in a foot of water, and as I pee, the sound of water rushing is very loud. I notice some churchgoers peering in through the window at me and seeing me, but I can't stop. It rushes out in torrents and goes on a long time. The people remind me of Hillary and Charles. (92 words)

Mirabelle and I have special tickets to a big Star Trek conference presentation in an auditorium. We go in close to where the speaker, Jonathan Frakes, will be. At first I don't like sitting there, because of my old fears about being in the middle of a crowd, but then I decide it's OK. We'll get to hear him interviewing all the special guests, like Capt. Kirk. We are excited. This will be fun. The staff pulls up a cart and goes through the crowd giving out promotional gifts. They put it on your left foot like a shoe, but it's a padded bag full of gifts. He kneels and puts it on my foot like it was the glass slipper and I the princess. I then bend down to see what my gift is. It forms into a turtle, a large one, like a tortoise. (146 words)

I try my hand at serving a tennis ball and I'm pretty damn good. A man, older, manager, is very interested in my prowess and he has his helpers line up behind me and hand me tennis balls as I lob them consistently over the net. I miss hitting some and feel frustrated, like the dream theme is to be a perfect hitter and somehow I'm not doing it. So I will it to be done. I'm handed some strange tennis balls that are not padded well, or square almost. Then I wake up in a room and don't know where I am, but suspect I'm in a room the manager got for me. I smoke a cigarette, aware a tennis athlete wouldn't do that. Someone knocks at the door and I go answer it, hesitantly looking for where the door is. It's some big, muscular man selling something. I go back in and peek around a corner of a door to see who is there. It's a woman, possibly the manager's wife. She has dark hair. (177 words)

Jake and I are in his "car," a flat, large platform on small wheels. I say this is a California car. It's nice and fun, but wouldn't be too safe if we crashed. I now am with some women and I'm trying to write down a dream I had, in detail, and someone wants me to tell them the dream. I say I have to write this down first before it's all gone! It's fading fast even as I try to repeat the details in my mind to keep them there. I write fast. [BL] (94 words)

I must check out dream number 286. Now I'm at Grandma Mildred's house, only it's different. Dovre and I are going to go on a trip. Dovre is going to drive. She helps me with food and things. We look at a map and Dovre says, "We can go all the way to the tip of South America." It sounds interesting to me. Dovre drives the car through the house and the front yard. I see lots of cats and I'm worried we will accidentally run over them. I feel a bump and feel queasy, thinking we did run over one. I see a brown cat and remark about how big it is. I look again and see its face. It's a pig, only it has a body of a cat! No wonder it's so big; it's really a pig. Then I look at advertisements in a newspaper or magazine and see the name Curtis Salgoto. He's advertising his music tape. The ad is like a movie on small dark negative like film or a negative. I am impressed and watch. It's his story. He's a small boy, maybe 9 years old. He's part black. He plays his harp. I tell Dovre he's my favorite harp man. He's good. He says he's going to move to K falls (Klamath) and I laugh. It's hard enough making it to the big time, but to move to Klamath will make it much harder. I didn't know he was black. Now he's lying face down in a river and his father pulls him out and says, "What are you doing?" He smiles and says he's OK. Bonnie sits in the river next to him to see if he's OK and not drowning.

I am somewhere, in a house I've never seen before, and visiting Ginny and Ernie. They keep adding more children and animals to their family. Ernie is sweet caring and accepting. Now we have a Siamese cat and I see her tummy as someone pets her and say, "She's pregnant," now there will be more kittens. A talking collie dog comes up to me and we chat. I pet it and the fur is so short it feels like nagahyde. It is red in color. Now we are going to go shopping, but Ginny is helping rearrange my furniture. I guess we are in my "house." She moves the file cabinets to the left and puts the bookcase behind another piece of big furniture. I point out that it will be harder for me to get to things now. She is involved in the project and we patiently wait until she's done to go. Ernie is very accepting and I feel love for him. We go to the store, like a huge Costco place. I climb three or four flights of stairs and wonder why I'm walking and how I'll manage when I get there. We get to the top and inside and I try to get into a shopping cart so Ginny can push me around. I don't fit. (220 words)

I am swimming and I see a woman under the water surface like trapped under ice and fighting for air at an open hole is the shape of a birth slit. I watch this and say that's a dream symbol I don't want to have! It is unpleasant. Now I go to a warmer beach and I am wading, but every time I put my foot down, I get something like a green frog creature stuck to my foot like a suction cup and I peel it off. I don't like them and try to get away from them. My Aunt Naomi and I are walking in the waves and I hear them hissing and swelling and she's concerned for me like the waves are too big and will knock me over. I look and see they are normal height and ignore her warnings to come in closer to shore. I am a bit annoyed at her for being unnecessarily concerned. (161 words)

I am tired and want to go home to my parents' for the weekend, but Jock has heard his play will be presented that night and he wants to see it. He turned to his wife and says, "Let's go see it." She is upset and says, "You go, I can't." He's upset. Why can't she go? She sounds like my mother, annoyed and not willing to be truthful. She says in a passive aggressive way, "No reason, really." I guess if she calls the nurse and sees if an ice pack on her knee will help, she can go. I am tense because it is clear to me as they argue that she's probably on her period and doesn't want to say. Jock keeps pressing her and I restrain my strong urge to interrupt and explain all the unspoken stuff going on. She then asks if I need to go to the bathroom, or I said, "I guess I'll go home now and not go to the play myself. I need a bathroom." "We'll use mine at the church," she says and gets up. What a pain. It's farther but, oh, well, I follow them up a hill along the shoreline. Mud squishes under foot. Now it's a cliff and as I climb up, Jock has a conversation with a young man from the church about a mutual client they work with who is a very evil, dangerous guy. Jock is giving him advice on how to work with him as I now have to go in the tiny, strange door of the church. It's a triangle opening with ropes of twine as a sort of archway opening big enough to stick my foot through. I say, "This is too small. I don't want to go in." Jock encourages me. I sit on the edge of the cliff and gently slide one foot (right) into the opening and squeeze myself slowly through (see drawing). It is easier than I thought it would be. I am surprised. (337 words)

Dwight has written a poem and I am surprised and very pleased. I ask to see it. He agrees and I lay it out. It is at first a very long piece of paper. That changes to a series or units or verses of 3-D objects. The first verse says something about home, hearth, etc. My mother is reading it with me and she is upset. Oh, now he's going to write bad things about me. I say reassuringly, "No, now don't take all this personally. Everyone has a mom, it's universal." I know I'm lying, but can't figure out how she got insulted by the words "home and hearth," which we slightly argue about the pronunciation of hearth. The next verse has little blow up plastic fruits like apples and bananas. The next verse has a real banana and apple and two wooden, old-fashioned cooking utensils. I keep moving the verses around as more keep coming. I am astounded at how much there is! He's finally opened up and let it out and wow, there is a a lot. It is sort of negative and full of pain. Then, the forgiveness verse finally comes, roses. I am very happy. Later, the word "Fritzvalue". (204 words)

Paulina (my daughter) and I are invited to come to a ceremony for the children by a Native American man. We agree and think it will be very interesting. We are looking forward to it. Unbeknownst to me, the man wants to marry me and is setting up this ceremony to camouflage the wedding ceremony. So Paulina and start walking and soon find ourselves out in a desert area like near M City. No one else is around and the road seems unmarked. We wonder if we are in the right place. I look back and see the dirt road and some people coming out way far back. So I know we are just ahead of everyone else. We continue on. Then we see some wooden houses, white man buildings, and realize that in order to make us comfortable, they have built this little village. We look at each building and admire it. They are cute. Now the Native American man comes to me and suggests I sit with the children during the ceremony rather than in the bleachers with the audience. I agree. He then shows me an ordinary smoking pipe and says if this is handed to me, I must hold it in my cupped hands just as he shows me, or I will offend the gods. I agree and watch carefully. I ask how I should return it after I have taken a smoke. He says, "Turn it this way (full circle, clockwise) and hand the pipe stem first." I listen carefully and nod. The ceremony begins.

I am in a small group of people who are coming up with story ideas. It is my turn and so I think back to what I'd been experiencing in the dream before and use part of that as the story. I say, "There's this military man whose father was into nuclear stuff, a professor, and he doesn't want to have anything to do with that stuff. He meets a woman who is excellent at different sports and an outdoors type. The challenge is..." I don't remember the rest. I then say, "I know it's similar to a movie I saw once." Then there is an interruption. Two teen girls come into the store to buy something. I turn to see what they need. The teacher says they are in the wrong store if they want jewelry. I say, "Oh, no, there is jewelry in this store; you just can't see it from where you are sitting." I describe what I see, which is a long wall filled with jewelry, and then the far right end has the ribbons and buttons and sewing notions he had seen. I get up to wait on the two girls, who seem to want to try on all the pretty jewelry and obviously don't have the money to pay for things. I want them to finish so I can go back and work on the story. (232 words)

I am a patient in a hospital, just being admitted. I overhear some nurses saying that they are going to strike and they will hide out at the OCA. I know this is serious and I must tell the authorities, so that patients won't be left in a dangerous situation. I notice some of the nurses coming near where I am hidden, behind some partitions, and I scoot down and hope they don't find me. They do find me and I pretend I am unconscious. They read my name off the bracelet I wear, the admitting plastic bracelet. Now, I know that if I tell, they'll probably be able to trace the leak to me. They leave, and I decide to go find the police. I tell them, hoping I won't get in trouble. (134 words)

I am in a house. A man, presumably my "husband," and I are cleaning out the closets. The second hand man comes to pick the stuff up. I point to a box of stuff and he takes it to his truck. I notice my husband's motorcycle was with the box and I call to my husband that he accidentally took his motorcycle. I then call out to the secondhand man that we don't want to give away the motorcycle. The secondhand man tries to console us and then gets a bit sarcastic. We don't change our minds, but insist. He gives it back reluctantly. I go to a room and see clothes hanging up and laying around. I hesitate on some of the outfits, but with the encouragement of my husband, am able to get rid of most of them. I get rid of slim wool skirts like in high school, a green net and chiffon prom dress, baby clothes, dresses of my girls when they were small. I keep one baby outfit because someone I know will be having a baby girl soon. I see Paulina B sleeping on a single bed; she is maybe 6 years old. We go down the hall, peeking into each room. I see a closet with bags and luggage and leave it there, because they belong to a guest. Finally we have cleaned out the whole house. We feel good about it. The secondhand man, now has a punk rocker haircut and is sarcastic. "Gee, with all this, I guess I'll only have to come back once a month!" Good, Bob," says my husband, sarcastically. (272 words)

Two nice young men are sort of the parents of Mateo. They ask him to do something and he doesn't want to, so they run around doing it for him. One of them stops and says, "No, we aren't going to do this any more. He can do things for himself. We've been too ready to do it for him." Mateo is upstairs and he overhears this and he gets scared and starts crying and saying, "No, no." Somehow this is scary for him. Now, I am comforting a fat seven-year-old girl, who is Bonnie. She is scared too. I go on. I seem to be at a fairgrounds-like place and the crowd is waiting for the Indian drumming to start. I am waiting too. The drummer is a redneck-looking, pot-bellied white man. He sets up a drum and tells the crowd they can get ready. At least half of them can dance. They move to the front. I stay behind, but now there is room for all of us to dance. I look at them doing a kind of twist and shout dance and feel scorn. That's not the right way to dance with respect for the spirit of the drum. I try to dance Indian. The song is over and the crowd goes away. I stay to watch the drummer who is setting up for the next song. He kicks at the fire he has created to keep it going and asks me to move one of the drums "over there." I pick one drum up reverently and carry it over to where he points. He keeps yelling instructions, but I can't seem to understand where he wants it and I keep doing it incorrectly until he finally yells at me and begins crying. I go to him and say, "I'm willing to help, but I can't understand what you're saying and there's no need to yell at me." He is embarrassed and ashamed and hangs his head and says, "I know Ma'am." He takes the drum and walks away and goes up into a carnival type building. I wait. I look up to see a Disneyland-like train turn and whirl above me. I see a railroad bridge to my left with people sitting along the edge waiting for a ride. A carnival worker comes up to me and says, "What happened? I hear Larry and ____ are crying." I say, "I don't know what happened. We were setting up for the next dance, we had the fire here and the crowd was there where it's fenced in now." I see a short storm wire fence. He opens a door and I see Larry of Uni house crying. He shuts the door. I say, "The other one is up there." I point to where the drummer had gone. (470 words)

A sweet man is teasing me, about kissing. He said, "What about this?" I say, "But that's male and male kissing." He says, "Do you like male kissing you?" I smile, shy, of course I do. I don't know if he's going to kiss me or not. (47 words)

I'm in a sort of playground area, only it's in a room. There are three round circle toys and two other women are with me. One says, "Let's play on these." I say, "OK." She stands on one, her arm hanging on to the circle and I stand on the middle one and then I say, "No, I want the one on the end." It felt better to have the middle one between us. Then you lean back so the circle thing starts spinning and you hang on for dear life. It goes really fast and the centrifugal force pulls you hard and I wonder if I can hang on! I say, "I don't know if I can do this!" My arms are so weak. Maggie, who has MS, agrees it's hard. But it is fun. Then we get off and the woman says, "There's one thing you do that I don't like." I turn away and say, "What is it?" not really wanting to hear. She says, "I don't like it when you say that men don't like you because you're overweight. It doesn't have anything to do with how you look." I feel annoyed and say, "Oh, I suppose I have to remember that when I'm out with you, I should never make that type of remark," like this is a great deal to ask of me. She says, "Yeah, I do expect that." I shrug and walk away from her. Now I'm standing in a street and I see Zippy dog. I call him over and he lays down and I lay down and we cuddle as I pet and hug him in a friendly way. I croon, "Oh, silly dog." Then I look up and see some cars coming and wonder if I should sit up so they realize there is a human here as well as a dog, so they'll think twice about running us over. I get up. Now I want to walk to the store and get something to eat. A girl, mildly mentally retarded, says she'll go with me, but only if we take the bus. I smirk and say, "Is the walk too much for you?" She smiles and says cheerfully, "Yes." I feel my body vibrate and say jokingly, "OH! What is this? An earthquake in me?" I laugh and look around to see a man in the distance using a jackhammer which has caused the vibration. We cross the street to go to the bus stop. (417 words)

I am in charge of creating a small little group of marchers for a presentation or parade. They play flutes and I need to figure out how they are going to hold their music. I look around for something that will work and see a small little flat board and think it will do, and then I go to other classrooms to see what's around. I find a larger, more fancy thing that would hang from their neck and the sheet music would be facing the audience and I wonder how they would read the music, even though it looks pretty for the audience. Then I see a photography class and listen in and realize they really want it to be spiffy and entertaining. So now I find a long, ornate board and we'll do some precision moves and wear costumes. I go into another room and as I'm going down the street in my wheelchair, I see another woman in a wheelchair, a larger woman like Rudean. We travel together for a block or so, bumping over curb cuts and ducking cars. She seems negative. I go into a class, two narrow rows of desks and everyone hurriedly gets up to make room for me. I feel conspicuous, but this is normal. They aren't used to the chair. We get settled in and they are talking about doing a dance and can't imagine how I can participate. I point out to them that I already know how to dance and ask Archie to dance with me to show them. He does some warm up moves and I do too with my chair and spin around and skid to a stop and everyone is impressed and amazed. They and I shove the rugs and furniture aside to make room and then Archie and I dance. It is lovely. At one point he pulls me up to standing and we dance. I then lean into the instructor and incorporate him into the dance. They start relaxing around me. Now another woman is going to share her dance and needs to cast the dancers. She says angrily and sadly that suicide is the end. I say, "Maybe, maybe not. If the person doesn't learn from it, they die and that's sad, but if they learn and grow from it, it is beautiful. It's a pivotal decision point, a challenge, and therefore powerful and beautiful." Now she instructs us to stand in our places. We form a sort of short square cross. She is skinny and has a skinny young boyfriend, dance partner. Other skinny young women are in her dance team. I see a sting of bright colored decorator lights, like Xmas tree lights in the wing she and her team are in. (461 words)

I am in a house and apparently living with Ellie and Charla. I hear Ellie yelling at Charla and Charla is crying. I feel very upset at Ellie and want to go rescue Charla from Ellie's anger. I see a picture of Ellie on the mantel/bookshelf, smiling. I go looking for them, but I am worried that that means I shall be leaving all my possessions in the house in the care of my roommates who might steal it. As I approach Ellie who seems to be in another house, I see the three roommates, two men and a woman driving away with my van, stealing it. I yell at them to stop. They keep on going. I get in the passenger side of a brown car with a man driving and we chase, in the woods, up the mountains; we are going fast and side by side. I lean out the window and yell at them, poking the driver with an umbrella. I viciously poke him, trying to get him to stop. He laughs at me. The woman reaches her hand over and says, "Give it to me." She is laughing. I say, "You'd really like that, wouldn't you. Then you'd grab it and I wouldn't have anything to fight with." Just at that moment, the man's head explodes and he just oozes out from under the door jam. No one is driving now and I am shocked. The other two don't even attempt to try to get the van under control. It crashes over a steep hillside and crashes and burns. The flames now start a forest fire. Now the man and I must run for it. We try to go downhill but can't. It's a cliff. We want to find a river. We are forced by the fire uphill and he remembers a place we can hide, a creek. We find instead a small cave and the smoke is now overtaking us. He says, "Get in the cave," and I balk. What if there's a bear in there? What if we suffocate from the smoke? He pushes me in. I see a bear, but it is too busy trying to survive to pay any attention to me. (370 words)

I am hiding in a rectangular basement room, thick cement, white walls and little else. There is a bed and some food stored there. I peek in little holes in the wall to see what the enemy army is up to and see a general talking his plans and see a map on the wall. Now I must try to escape and get the information out and I open the door and skulk up the stairs. I see soldiers and I hold my rifle ready to shoot and nearly shoot one, but I notice that if I just keep walking and don't draw attention to myself, they seem to not notice me. I had nearly blown it by making them pay attention to me. So I get across the lawn and see lots of parked cars, interesting designs. I decide on one and get in. I discover it's a sort of hang glider. I peddle like mad and notice I'm on a dirt road going slightly uphill and hope I can get momentum going before they get me. Then the road starts a gentle down slope and I start to go faster. Then I get a bit of wind and rise up in the air and then I see a cliff and off it I go, gliding and looking down the steep mountain slope. I save lots of time as the road is windy and I can take a shortcut this way. I see off in the distance far below a city and head for it, hoping I don't run out of wind or whatever it takes to keep me up there before I arrive where I need to go. (280 words)

Somehow I am helping get Jared's car fixed by a grumpy neighbor, brake shoes and other stuff, and I get the bill and pay it, even though I think it's too much. Then Jared and Dorothy come and he's belligerent and he's yelling how the job wasn't done right and he won't pay and I get furious and leap between him and Howard and yell at Jared, "Hey, I'm talking to you. We went to a lot of trouble to get this done for you. Now I know you traveled a lot of miles and used lots of time, but so did we and, hey, don't walk away when I'm talking to you. You finish listening to me, and then go yell at your son! We did the best we could!" And then the neighbor comes in apologizing, he had put on the wrong kind of brake shoes and offers to fix it at no charge, which is what Jared was mad about and saying he wouldn't pay for. It all gets worked out. (174 words)

I am going to give my girl child a birthday party. It's 1:00 in the afternoon and I go to see if the neighborhood children are here yet to go to the movies with her. Someone says she's just now taking her nap, and I realize the timing isn't going well. I decide to let her sleep until I've got the party together. I wait. A few kids, maybe a year old, come in and play in the living room, then some neighbors, and now there's a lot of people there. I laugh, watching them play. They are so fun to watch and so creative. I call out, "Did anyone really want to go to the movies after all?" Or did they prefer to continue, with what they are doing? They seem quite content to be playing as they are doing with the fun games and things I have provided. I say, "OK," and go into the kitchen area to get the cake and ice cream going. My mother and people are there, talking and so on. A phone call comes; it is Amber, who wants to know if her mother is going to stay there, because it will ruin their plans if she stays longer. I notice a man who I like is listening and watching. I say, "Hey, no reason why you can't come stay overnight here, we can visit." She hesitates and then agrees. I say, "I know there's plenty of room," and then hesitate, counting where I've already promised to put people, this man included, but I decide there is enough room. She agrees to stop by tomorrow on her way home from wherever she is now. Now there is some sort of challenge with two men and the challenge is that I must catch a ball (or manuscript) being thrown over the bad man neighbor's fence and I must break the taboos and rules and hop over into his yard, over his fence, and retrieve it. This is pretty scary because he owns a huge dog named something fierce like Thunder or something, a huge great dane that would sooner eat you than look at you. I take the challenge cheerfully. I leap up over the tall fence and see a small, skinny space and a second fence I leap up to the top of the second fence and the dog is barking and growling and trying to get to me. I hold him at bay by putting my foot up against a small dog door (for a large dog) and hold it shut. I dip down and grab the object. The neighbor man comes out and threatens to kill me. I hop back over to my side, safe and unharmed but with both man and dog furious at me. (465 words)

I and my "husband" kiss and he says he wants to lay on top of me and cuddle. He says it feels better that way. We cuddle and it is sweet and sensual. I love it. There is the slight tantalizing promise of sexual feelings later. After that, I am putting all the children to bed. It is fun and sweet. I play with them and kiss them and they hug. My roommate S is angry and upset and I encourage her to leave. Now we have to find another place to live. I go downtown and enter a newspaper office to find an ad. A man is telling his ad to the clerk. He says, "Near downtown and near the river." I say, "That sounds like what I'm looking for." We agree he shouldn't put his ad in and we'll go look for it. I apologize to the clerk for taking him away. She's OK with it. We go to see he house. The living room is large. We walk through to the kitchen, which is also large. There are several sets of sinks, stoves etc. I walk through to the back yard, which is enclosed, wooded and beautiful. The children will love it. I look up and notice the entire huge backyard is roofed to protect from rain. I decide I don't like that and it changes to just an overhang near the porch. The man shows me the mosquito netting to roll down around the porch. I wonder if that means there are... [NOTE: THIS DREAM WAS CUT OFF.] (256 words)

I'm at a family gathering and it's getting time to leave. The entertainment is over. A man like Raul had done an act of magic and juggling. He had handed out little gifts and four knives didn't get handed out and he said he'd give us them later. Now only my two brothers and one sister are left around the table and we start talking. Lydia complains about how my mother is always this way or that and I am surprised to hear her being negative. I usually do that. I then read a portion of a letter I wrote (which had a few mistakes where I needed to add the word IF, like the sentence said something like I would like to die, or I would die if, but I wrote, IF I would like to die) several times and on the third time they yawn and stop listening. I feel a little hurt, but acknowledge that maybe I was being boring and attention-getting. They agree. Dwight takes over and tells me how I'm always so bossy. They all take turns telling me off. They aren't going to put up with it any more. I feel bad, but unfortunately agree with them. Now, the entertainer is back and does his thing and other entertainers are there. They all wear black and white masks on their faces. I remember that is the theme of this occasion. He reminds himself to give Jake the four knives he hadn't in the last round. Charla is sitting on Lydia's lap and leaning over on me and now she wants to curl up in my lap. I say, "You're fine this way," (on Lydia's lap but near me), but she insists and curls up on me. It's nice and I hug her and cover us up with a blanket. Then she slides off my lap and goes to play and begins crying. I go over to see. She is a skinny cloth doll with a ring stuck on her skinny one-leg trunk. I say, "Is this what you are crying about?" She says, "Yes." I help her remove the ring. She is happy and I hug her and let her finish her crying. When she was on my lap, I was talking with Jake on my right, and I started to say, "Uncle Fo," but then I said to him, "I'm sorry. I forgot. I just like that name." "Well, I don't," he said, angrily. They are all four really on my case. It was so rare that we all talked like this and really shared our feelings, and we could only do it because all the other relatives were already gone. (448 words)

I am entering a room where a graduation will take place. I pick up a crying boy to comfort him. He's afraid of this graduation. I hug him and sooth him and explain that soon a bunch of people in blue robes will come in and it will be OK. We enter the room and walk to the opposite side against the wall. There are no chairs and I wonder how I'll manage standing through the whole thing. Lydia is now on my left and my mother on my right. I see young people walking in randomly with blue robes on and point them out to the boy. There is water about mid-calf height on the floor and I am aware of a hole in front of me and wonder where it is exactly. I worry about it. It moves toward me and I think I'm going to step in it and disappear. My mother ridicules me for being over-concerned and making a fuss. The boy gets down to go to his father. The boy's name is Dickie. Ugh. I think, "A chip off the old block." I decide I must leave the room to insure my safety. I leave and now am in a kitchen-like area. I decide to sleep in the van and now I'm out there; it is a cold, snowy night. A window is open. I order a special sleeping bag from a catalogue that will keep me warm. I notice the van is now in a heated sort of garage room and a horse is there. It loves me intently and wants me to ride it, but I hesitate. He shortens his legs so it's easy for me to get up, he loves me so much. I try to get on over his ample rump, wondering if he'll kick me. He, of course, won't because he needs me so badly. I get on and he grows back up to his normal height. I ride him into the house and decide to take a warm bath. I then get out of the tub, noticing I'm still in the garage room and it is being kept well heated for me at great expense. I hang up a yellow plastic shovel thing on a hook on the wall and remind myself to go get more of those hooks. They are very helpful. My mother is annoyed with me for getting so much special privilege. I go into the kitchen area to the table. I think I assure her I'll clean up after myself. She is disapproving of what I do and how I do it. (437 words)

I am with Dovre and we are at some kind of campground resort area. I am on a bicycle-like thing and am going back to my camp area. There is a center line of broken tree stumps in the road and I ride over them like they are those bumps in the center line. As I turn a corner and get off the bike, I see Michael (of crystals) Ron. He's leaving and I am entering and we pause and wave to each other. I say, "I'll see you later." He says, "I'm leaving tomorrow," and I say, "I'm leaving tonight. I guess this is goodbye." We look at each other uncertainly, wanting to connect, but the moment passes and I walk on. I think about that moment, feeling badly that I didn't say anything to connect later. I just let it pass like I always do, when I'm in automatic. Then, I find a bathroom and see four or five open stalls of toilets and look for the least messy one. Some have leaks and some have turds in them. I squat over a tiny, low bowl and have a bowel movement. I am a bit constipated and it is hard to get it out. A woman comes over and chats with me as I am squatted in this embarrassing position. Then Michael/Ron comes in and it's no longer the bathroom but my campsite. I am laying down and he starts to make gentle, hesitating love to me. I want him to, but I am "thinking" it, not feeling it. I french kiss him and wonder why I am anticipating that when I don't particularly like it. He follows my lead. I wonder what I'm doing. Why can't I just relax and feel it, and not be so uptight about performance or what he thinks? Then I remember we are out in the open and wonder if people will see us. Michael/Ron then scoots us off the blanket and under a small table and pulls a blanket over us. I say, "Oh, don't do that. Now you are in the gravel." I want him to be more comfortable, but he says it's OK and picks me up and carries me to his camp site which is more private. I am amazed at his strength, because I am still lying down and covered by this table and blanket. He says, "Just a minute," and goes into a small cabin bed area and then invites me in. I realize this is Claude's bed and feel funny making love to Ron in it when I'd rather be with Claude myself. I go in and lay down. Michael/Ron says, "Oh, you sat on my eagle button," and I realize he and I are wearing army jackets. I am surprised he was ever in the army, being as he's so gentle and new-age. I make a joke about sitting on his eagle and he says it's still cold in here. I feel the coolness and agree. Then I decide to unbutton the jacket. I do it matter-of-factly, wondering why I don't use this obvious opportunity to be sexy and provocative. Later, it's time for me to leave. I try to put things back like they were and pack my things. Michael/Ron says he's going over to his vehicle and put things away. He does. I see gold bangle bracelets and chains for necklaces and wonder if they are Sharon's (Claude's new girlfriend's.) I see toys and I guess they are for her daughter. I feel some jealousy and sadness. Now I go looking for Michael/Ron. I pass a camp trailer/tent that is shaking violently as the two people in it are making passionate love. I laugh at it all because it wasn't so long ago I was with Michael/Ron making love and now these people, oblivious to others, are having at it. I see his van set up and go there. Then I can't find him. The van has turned into a fancy RV. I turn to go back but he calls to me on the road and catches up. Then I see my father. He has come over the mountain on a bus so he can help me drive home over the mountains. I am relieved a bit because I then won't have to drive myself. My father talks of aunts and uncles that are old now and in some places they have to live together in retirement centers. Maybe that's not so bad, I wonder. (753 words)

I am on stage, as a sort of stage manager, in C City. A little black girl is going to do ballet and tap dancing. She does the ballet and the audience loves it, although it is a redneck audience and usually doesn't care for this sort of thing. I think some rough man kind of forced them to be there, because he wanted the girl to have an audience. Just before the show, I had looked through the curtains to see only a few people seated up front and to the left side. There is a short intermission for the girl to change into her tap shoes. The time gets longer and the audience gets restless. I think, "I'd better do some Evangeline if this keeps up." She comes back, but she doesn't want to dance now. She says her tummy is upset and she had to go to the bathroom and maybe she'll dance, maybe she won't. I say, "Then I need to know. Take one minute to decide. Either way it's OK. If you dance, fine, if you don't, fine, I will just do my Evangeline character. But I need to know now!" She agrees to dance. I go out front of the curtain and chat with the audience about how the town hasn't changed much since I was there years ago. [BL] (225 words)

I observe as a woman drives a car, and in the center of the front seat there is a bathtub and a naked woman is in it and a man is in the passenger or back seat. He's kind of rough and I worry the naked woman is too vulnerable. (50 words)

I am driving the wrong way, against traffic. I see four lanes of busy traffic coming at me and dodge the cars crossing the lanes to get to the right side of the road. Then I am angry at Ellie because she has decided to move out of my house and I don't think she's ready yet. I tell her that she should wait until she's got her full head up out of the "waves," not just her eyes, meaning she takes too much risk and needs to slow down and take care of herself. (95 words)

I am in a bedroom; I have just moved in. (It's similar to this new apartment I live in.) I am looking at a computer-like monitor that shows pictures and I see "The top of the world," a village in the alps, like. My mother is there, holding her son, my baby brother. He is 2 months old. My mother has red lipstick on and speaks with her jaw clenched. She says the recipe given this year with the calendar was "Yom Kippers" and she just wasn't going to make that. She wasn't up to it. Did I have my big box of recipes still? I said I did but it's probably in storage. I'd have to get everything out of storage and look for it. She hands the baby to me. I hold him. He's cute and I marvel at how he is my brother, and yet I have grandchildren older than he. It will be fun to have him around occasionally. I then get in bed, after giving the baby back to my mother. I am laying in a single bed and feel cold. I try to pull the blankets over me. (194 words)

I am walking through the city blocks of a new city, sight seeing. I am now beyond where the stores are and walking along the side of the highway. There are no houses or anything, but I am curious about what is beyond it. The only way to explore a new city is to walk all the streets and see what's what. I decide this way will be too long and I turn and go the other way and am now going down a hill and the ocean is on the left. I want to take a picture and start to cross the road to the little turn off where I can be safe and take a picture. A huge RV pulls up there and I wait, thinking how ironic, just when I was going to go there. Finally they pull away. I get there and put on my wheelchair brakes. I kind of roll a bit anyway, which makes me nervous because it's a sheer dropoff. I focus the camera which looks like opera glasses. I see a small island with birds on it. At first I thought there was a polar bear on it, but it was birds. I snap shots, bringing them closer with the telephoto lens. I then go on and am in a house with I think, Shannon, the old the community college poetry teacher. I've written something, a letter perhaps, and she isn't reading it. Another woman picks it up and looks at it. Nobody is much impressed. (254 words)

Mirabelle and I are in a church and we start clapping our hands to get the congregation to keep time with us. Then we start singing. It went something like this, "Lord I need your help now," and He said, "Just pray to me." I said, "I can do that Lord, I can do that, because I have God, and God has me." Then we'd sing another verse and repeat the chorus. The audience would clap with us at first and then quiet up to hear the words of the verse. (91 words)

A black man is attracted to me and me to him. I like his gentleness and loving attitude. I think he's sexy as well. But I hesitate because he's loud mouthed and uncouth and it is somewhat embarrassing to have him around my friends. He's testing me to see if I am honest and open. There is a parade and I join it, acting silly and joining in the march/dance. He likes that I'm willing to do that. He asks me questions about a man named Scott who stayed overnight. He stands very close to me and I feel like I want to melt into his arms, but resist. He wants to know if he stayed two nights and I tell him honestly it was only one night. He wants to know if I made l love to him and I tell him no. He won't believe me at first. I tell him openly it isn't that I'm virtuous; I was scared and can't relax to lovemaking when I'm scared. He respects that. He's painted small purple squares on my black floor. It makes a nice design. He has to go to the bathroom so he says, "I'll leave my money and my drugs here with you; guess I'll find out if I can trust you." He does. I then leave the room talking to someone, perhaps my husband. I see my 2-year-old son going into the room and follow and see that he's eaten one of the big, colorful pills. I reach my finger in his mouth to get it out and he won't cooperate. I dig around his narrow, clenched mouth and finally force it out. I wonder what kind of scary drug it is, maybe LSD. The man comes back and I tell him what happened. We are more openly in love with each other and can't resist one another. He is less uncouth and I begin to realize he's a talented artist and rich and had been playing a charade to see if I could l love him without the finery. I found out he was an artist because I bumped a book on a chair and a picture fell out and I picked it up. Tempted to open the book and look more, I resolutely don't as that would be an invasion of privacy. We hug and kiss. It is delightful, warm and loving. (399 words)

I belong to some club and we are hanging out and talking and Ralph comes in with a scathing letter. He doesn't like the way we waste time playing with tools or knitting or letting Clarisa talk and play. We think he's being rude and uncaring. He doesn't like the maps on the wall. Then there is some kind of space travel and Sheila J is old and ill and reads poetry. (72 words)

I am working in something like a children's camp. Then it's sort of a circus-like place and lots of the employees get sick and so only a few of us are left. Someone says we can all double up on the jobs and no one will know we're short. The show will go on and they sure will be surprised at curtain call when only five of us come out. I say, "Even I can help." I walk along an edge of a canyon and look over to find the activity I can help with. I find a clear plastic toy I shot like a cannon. Later, I am tired and want to go home. I feel like a nurse from Vietnam, tired, shocked etc. I bum a ride from George, a Native American who lives in these isolated parts. He takes a shortcut that is a hair raising ride, up a steep road hill and over and down. He laughs and says, "Hang on." I kind of like the sensation, like a roller coaster ride, and laugh. We get to town and I am exhausted and I say, "George will you marry me?" meaning it's so hard sometimes to do it alone. He actually takes me seriously and likes the idea as he respects and likes me. He starts talking about us spending time together. I smile and say, "How sweet, but I was just joking." He is sad and disappointed. I look in my wallet for some money to help pay gas. I find a voucher for 45 cents and then see a dollar bill, then a couple of fives. I give him a two dollar bill, which is more than I thought I could afford, but it's OK. I try to stuff all my papers back in the wallet to close it. I get out of the car, but he really wants to talk, to stay with me. Now I'm with a woman nurse who brought me home and we are watching the continuing romance of George and me as it blossoms. How very sweet and poignant. The woman yawns and asks if I need any help getting my bed made or arranged. I said no it's OK. I sleep in a child's bed. Then I wonder if I have refused help and will need it later as usual. The car is parked backwards in a steep driveway and the brakes are on, but it starts sliding backward to the garage and I wonder if I could be hurt by being cut in half as the car forces it's way into the garage. It stops and I am OK. I watch George and "me" hugging and think it happens that way sometimes, small town, two people get together and the romance and love slowly develops over time. I feel alone and sad as I get out of the car to go to my house, alone. (488 words)

I have a great idea for a book or something and I am rushing home to write it or research it and I deliberately go around a crowd of people having fun and bike on a path alone. I go to the house I used to live in and see my mother and Lydia are still there cleaning up and packing. I ask permission to come in and use the phone. I walk through several rooms, noticing the wallpaper is newspaper comics and have holes in them, and think I should try to help fix that but decide to continue on with the writing phone calls.

I enter a room and George Carlin has a huge stack of glass bowls and I suggest we clean them. He and I are doing this precarious balancing act with the dishes as we playfully argue who's going to do the dishes and when. In order to prevent the whole bunch to tumble and break, we manage to make three smaller columns of dishes. Now I am at the sink and washing off dried bits of catsup and food off the dish. Now I am looking for a place to go to the bathroom. Paulina has moved in with me, so she's around. I want some privacy. Howard is around, too. I find a small hall-like room with a door at each end and I try to close both doors as Paulina and someone is on the left side in a living room watching TV and someone else is on the right side in another room. I squat to have a bowel movement and pause, wishing I had brought toilet paper. I realize if I let go, I will urinate all over the floor, and I pick up a bit of paper debris to hold under me to catch some of the flow. It's going to be a mess. Then I realize, now that I am alone, I can just go into the bathroom and do it normally in a toilet and save myself a lot of muss and fuss. I get up to go to the bathroom, feeling relieved.

A large jungle cat, like a tiger and a huge snake, are all wrapped up around each other fighting. A cut is made on the back of the cat's head at the base of the skull so the snake can get its poison into the cat and kill it. But if it's the snake doing it, where did he get the paws?? So I don't know who is biting and poisoning who! (72 words)

I am teaching a small group of difficult students, math. They're rowdy, refuse to be quiet and I keep trying to talk over them. Finally, in frustration, I yell, "Shut up," and slap them around on the face and ears. It doesn't really do much. I dismiss the ones who are merely marginally difficult and say these four have to stay. I tell them to go up to the board and give one of them (four teen males) the problem 5 + 5 to work, I am sarcastic. He can't get it. Later, I am with Paulina and looking in a glass display case at miniatures. I want to pierce my eyelid and wear a small model of the USS Enterprise. We look at them and I change my mind because they would be so heavy I wouldn't be able to open my eye. I see my small kitten and it is playing with a small colorful mouse with a baby miniature mouse at its side. I hope my cat doesn't hurt the mouse baby. Later I ask my mother where I should put this bowl of food. I tell her I put it under a shelf on a wall so it's out of the way of feet and won't get stepped on. She says that's OK. Aunt Naomi is around somewhere. (222 words)

Dora and I and Ellie as a 10-year-old are in a house and I look out the open door and see some boats in a river and say, "Look at the parade." Behind the five or so boats are people jogging on the water. I am amazed. How can they walk on water? We go out and look. It's those new shoes with special soles, made to resist the water surface so they don't sink. Dora wants a closer look, so she goes into the river and walks in the same spot and we laugh because it is clear that the river there is so shallow it appears she is walking on the surface. As she walks, she gets deeper and deeper and now she is swimming (she is pregnant). Now Ellie decides to join her and jumps in the deep part and swims around. I get very upset because it is a steep embankment and the water is deep and I couldn't go save her if she got in trouble. I insist she come out now. "Ellie, come out right now." "No, mommy, I want to swim." "Ellie, please come out; I am afraid." "I'm OK, mommy" She stays in and I escalate to screaming my orders in fear. She refuses and gets out and dives back in several different times while I explain in a screaming, tearful, fearful voice how dangerous it is, and if she had trouble, I couldn't go save her and she'd drown, or worse. I realize with some guilt I would have to throw myself in and try to save her and drown with her. Finally she gets out and says, "But in the Babar book, it said you have to try new things." I am upset that she got this idea out of a children's book. I explain how you need to take risks, but only after you have thought them out and know if they are safe enough risks. You could get killed just jumping in and trying something without thinking it through. She is not convinced. Later, I look at a file from my classes and see notes from a teacher about a series of my dreams or poems. I feel overwhelmed by the fact that this is just one long list of things I could do out of many. (389 words)

I am in an apartment that is across a street from a gas station. A man comes over and says that this could be mutually beneficial for me and the man who owns the station. I have something he wants and he has something I want. The man comes over, kind of a geek, and says, "Oh, by the way, I owe you some money because I helped myself to some tags for hunting and I need to pay you now." And I say, "Oh, really? Well, then you should also pay me interest because you didn't even ask." He laughs and tries to weasel out of doing that. Now he and another man and I are walking, still dickering about the money, and he wants to be my honey. He asks and I say no. He then puts his hand/arm around my shoulder and I walk out from under his embrace. That makes him mad. He's kind of like a wealthy black man, only he's white. I go into a closet to find a pretty dress to wear and he is watching jealously. (184 words)

I am watching CNN and it is a hidden camera in Noriego's bedroom. He is laying in bed, on his back, and no covers over him. I am a bit embarrassed and curious and look. I see he is naked and I want to see what his penis looks like. He's kind of flabby and has dark, black, curly pubic hair and a dark-skinned, medium-sized, semi-flaccid penis. He starts to play with it to excite himself and I think, "How weird. He knows the camera is there." I watch, disgusted and fascinated. Then a snake tongue comes out of the tip of the penis and Noriego curls up so he can get that tongue flicking in and out of his mouth. He's almost in the shape of a circle and the flicking tongue, forked, is quite long and active. (139 words)

"I am driving and there is road work and a detour. I get out of the car and start walking, only I take the wrong way and the men start teasing me by saying loudly, "Hey what kind of person doesn't read the signs?" I shrug and turn and get on the right road and see two men walking that way. The road isn't paved yet, they are about to pave it. As I am walking, I realize that I am supposed to get married at 2 o'clock and look at my watch. It is 5 after 2:00. I am late. I had forgotten I was getting married today and I feel embarrassed. I need to find a phone to call. Darn it, now if I do the wedding another day, it will cost more money for more flowers and so on. I sure made a big mistake! I tell the men I need to get there because I'm getting married. I tell Lucy, who I don't actually see. I say, "What can this be saying, that I forgot I was getting married? Maybe I don't want to get married!" I find a house and ask to borrow the phone. Is it OK to call information to get the number? They say yes. They ask where it's being held, M City? I say, "No, more like C City." Then I remember, it's E City. I need the diocese, but I can't remember it's name or number. (246 words)

I am in an audience watching the Tuesday rehearsal of the classic Star Trek and Captain Kirk is doing badly. He is high on something and forgetting his lines and not being at his best. I am disappointed because I really like him. Meanwhile a fat, tall older man, a chicken farmer grandpa, likes me and is making advances. I think, "Why is it that the ones I want are flawed and I don't want the ones that want me?" I get up to leave. I am a younger, virginal woman from a foreign country, maybe India. Kirk follows me and he wants to make love, but that is against the mores of my country. Why should I give up something valuable for this man? I am walking and I see a pond or large fountain. It is raining torrentially on the pond and on my van, which is parked by it with the doors open. I wonder if the interior of the van will be ruined, but somehow it's OK because this rain seems so special and intense and beautiful. I am enthralled by it. Another man comes up to me and wants me to walk in the rain with him, and join the line of people wading in the pond near the edge. I choose not to, even though it has a strong pull on me to abandon myself to the feeling. I go on and Kirk still follows. He wants to kiss me and is flirting and he's now in a cardboard box, a long narrow one, and I decide to give in to him. I pull him out of the box and into my arms and we kiss. I have risked all my values and respect. He then laughs and goes on. He is shallow and is no longer interested in me. I feel betrayed. (309 words)

I am visiting in Dover and meet a large woman who is a comedian and runs a restaurant in her home. I'm with Ginny. I want to tell this woman that I am a comedian too, but feel hesitant and shy. Finally I open my back pack, which has two zipper panels, to get my tapes to share with her. I see food in there, eggs, sandwiches, etc., that we had packed for the day. I hope the tapes aren't getting ruined. I tell her that the one tape is my comedy character, Evangeline, and the other one is my poetry, just plain poetry. I see that the picture on that tape is me in my wedding dress. All I see is the veil as my back is turned. She takes the tapes and thanks me. I haven't the courage to tell her I'm selling them and feel badly I let her have them without any money, but it's OK sort of because its networking. Later she gives me two tapes of her material and we're even. We are in her living room where a small group of people are having dinner at the one table of her restaurant. Now a CP man in a chair grabs my hand and wants me to run along side him. Off we go and I'm yelling angrily, "I can only do this with skates." Over and over I yell that, but he doesn't get it and drags me along. Finally I get him to stop and I angrily ask him why didn't he listen to me. I know I didn't exactly yell stop! but anyone with a brain could tell that's what I'm saying. (281 words)

I am seated at a round table with other people and we are being guarded by alien beings (sort of reptilian). They are feeding us to fatten us up to eat us later. I realize this and pass my food on to the others so I won't get fat. I hope they don't notice. I watch them carefully, feeling fear because I know at some point I shall have to make a stand and will probably be killed. At one point I am somehow flying up the outside wall and peeking inside a window where two aliens are going to make love. As they do, I overhear one saying in horror, "You have a white cross mark on your hand." This means that their blood will kill him if he contacts it. I then know how I can save myself. Now I am back at the table and I try to set up a fight between aliens so their bad blood will kill themselves off. I hope I'm not killed in the process. [BL] (173 words)

I have to do the next round in the comedy challenge and I can't decide if I should do the routine I did before or do a new one. I feel very nervous. There are a series of places I must go in sequence to do the routine. The first one is in a living room late at night. I keep getting distracted and now it's time to do the routine and I don't remember all the old routine. I sure wish I'd practiced more. I start to talk, saying anything that comes to mind and some of the jokes are funny. I tell them I had dreamed a joke and naturally wrote it down. It was very funny, but when I woke up I looked at what I had written. It said, "Frackel ummm orange." Everyone thought that was very funny and laughed. Then a man starts talking to me, sort of interviewing me, and I spend the rest of the routine time talking with him in front of the small group of audience members. I hope it counts. After it all, I must rest before going on to the next round and lay down on a sofa bed (hideaway bed). The man who is attracted to me lies down beside me in spoon fashion. He is hesitant, but he wants to and I pretend to be asleep, even though I enjoy him being near. Then he reaches over and kisses me sweetly. I do not respond, pretending to sleep and enjoy the kiss. He says, "Please don't tell my wife I did this." (265 words)

It has bamboo sliding panels over the bookshelves. Then I find a wallet and I open it and it has many interesting and roomy pockets with zippers. The zippers are fairly easy to work and I am surprised at all the room in the little compartments. Then I wonder how I would fold it back up into a wallet when I fill all those compartments. I find a red small purse with another wallet in it and want it. It is $9.95, and even though this is a high price, I decide to get it as well as the other. (134 words)

I am staying in a nice old house and wish I could still live there in the summer. I go into a bedroom and sit on the bed. I notice a fine mist of rain in the room and see drops of water leaking out of the light bulb socket on the ceiling. Well, this needs to get fixed! I watch as the light bulb itself expands and contracts like a drop of water about to drip. Then I look over to my right and see a display hanging from the ceiling. It is some books, one of which is entitled "Rage," a picture of a very unhappy child's face and a camera. I don't want that there. I realize it's the same book I have at home. I think it away, and it disappears. The next morning I get up and look out the window and see a huge "moon," only it's really earth, blue with clouds and I say, "My God, where's my camera?" I look up at the ceiling and the display thing is gone and so is my camera. I look around at the night stand to the left of the bed and try to plug something in with an orange extension cord and plug. No camera. I go back to the right of the bed and see my camera there with five or six children's books piled neatly on top of it, including the one called "Rage." I am amazed and wonder how this all happened. My mother is there and I tell her of my experience, wondering if this is a wise move. Will she ridicule me or not believe me? I look out another window and see "Benjie" dog floating large in the sky like the earth was and want a picture of that. My mother is now on a balcony outside the window and the dog comes up close to sniff and play. I open a door. We are on the second floor, but the door goes to nothing. I hope I don't fall. I try to take a picture of this extraordinary dog floating so huge in the sky. (358 words)

I am driving a motorcycle "car" with two seats. It's sort of a race. I must stop for gas very often, like every ten feet or so, and I keep forgetting to turn the engine back on. Then I spin my wheels, wasting the gas. A dark-haired young woman in an emerald green outfit is racing me. She is behind me and never smiles. She'd ask me when I stop for gas and then I'd pass her on the road. The road is curvy like a curved staircase. A young man (maybe Dwight) is in the passenger seat.

I move aside so they can be together and the next thing I know, there are two couples in front and I am alone in back. I follow them from now on. We are now traveling and the road is now a hallway in a high-rise building. It's a boring, repetitious path around and around this square, uphill path. (95 words)

I see a dog who is very enthusiastic and eager to do his job. He is asked to sniff out where the woman is who is going to give them her baby. I follow the dog as he lunges, sniffing, through a thick crowd of people. It is nearly impossible to get through, it is so dense, but somehow the dog manages to worm his way through. A path opens for him and tightly closes as he passes. He finds a woman seated in a corner holding her baby girl. She sees the dog and says sadly, "You found me." She doesn't want to give up the baby. She had already given up the sister of this baby to these same people, but she resignedly goes with the dog back to the people and gives up the baby. Now I am seated on a couch and watch as a woman comes in and is told, surprise, she's going to get married. She wears a strapless dress, black, like my "kidnapped in Mexico" dress. Out of a closet pops a silly hip minister, a boy and maybe the dog. He will perform the ceremony. (193 words)

I am in a room and I am the "affianced" wife of Dr. Abrams. People think I am ordinary-looking and so do I, but I am supposed to be quite beautiful to be the "affianced" wife of Dr. Abrams. When I am announced, I am kind of surprised and think, "But I don't want it to be Dr. Abrams." Later I enter an elevator-like room and see what looks like a dead dog, small, cute and furry, but dead. "Ugh," I think, "I don't want to be in here with a dead dog." Then the elevator closes and I push the #3 button, but the elevator is very slow and goes to the basement first. The dog is now very much alive and is fiercely trying to eat my foot or bite my ankle. I must try to stave it off and pick up a "stick" or rectangular long, skinny piece of wood to force it back. It is a hard fight and it nearly gets me, over and over. The ride is slow and takes forever. (177 words)

I am walking down the street and I see Marilyn. She has seen a display for candies, popcorn and pinwheels. She calls me over. She says, "What fun! I want one of these." I look them over and say, "Well, I'm going on to the meeting. See you there." I feel a little bad leaving her there alone because she was obviously inviting me to have this fun with her. I go on and start to go in a restaurant door and see I'm going into the bar side and go on to the next door and enter. I see my group several tables deep and ask one man to move a moment so I can get past him. He looks annoyed and doesn't want to move. So I say, "OK," and go around the other way. Now I am going into the house where the meeting is and I am greeted by Carleen with a face mask of a grandmother. I laugh. Another woman enters with a mask and costume on. I say, "Oh, no one told me this was a theme and we needed to bring masks." More enter. They all have stylized faces (like in dance in movie Victor/Victoria. I go into living room. Carleen says, Just put your dessert there." I feel badly because I didn't bring anything. I go on in and see some old easy chairs and grab one and start to scoot it closer to another woman who is scooting hers closer to me. We laugh and scoot back and forth. Then I notice my thumbnail on my right hand has like a fungus on it. I look underneath and it is like the sworls in an animal pad (foot) or like a big fungus that is on old dead trees. I start to peel it off. It's like bread crust on the heel of bread and squishy. I get it off; it is quite large. I put it in a plastic bag. It is kind of gross. A girl comes up, maybe 10 years old. There is some game getting ready to be played. I get up and go into the kitchen. I want to take my clothes off, maybe adjust my bra. I am headed for a back bedroom through the kitchen and get my top off before I get there. Leroy (my cousin) is in the kitchen doing dishes and he sees and smiles. I hold my top over my breasts and try to hurry through the door. I can't get it open and Leroy asks me to help do the dishes. I don't want to, but feel guilty; again, I'm not helping out. (444 words)

I am in some man's bed and I'm reading his sex book, looking at pictures of a step-by-step sexual encounter. I see him hugging the woman from behind and I see the vulva from the perspective of looking at from the outside, like a doctor would see or a lover. I feel sexual excitement with all these pictures.

I have chosen a big fat book from the library about World War I. As it happens, WWI is happening and I must pack my things and move on. Robert Mitchum comes by and I tell him I will go west, and not east, because east is a false road and dangerous. He agrees. He and I have an innocent strong sense of love. We hug and kiss, and feel very connected with a sweet love. He asks me which things I'll take and I say all of them. I ask him to be tolerant and not laugh. I do take out some of the gem rocks and fossils so the load will be lighter for him and me. I have a blue backpack and a box. I decide to return the big fat book and get a smaller one. He says, "You don't have to do that," but I insist. It will make it easier for us. We need the information but it can be in a more compact form. We walk arm in arm to the library to do the exchange before we hit the road to do battle. (191 words)

I am sort of at Grandma Mildred's house. I am changing clothes and putting on the old outfit I wore many years ago, the reddish jeans, tight and sexy, and a reddish turtleneck. I have a long, flowing lacey slip on and have some trouble keeping it out of the jeans. I take the slip off. Jake is in the other room and is wearing a bright blue shirt and is looking much better, happier. I realize that he and Valerie are getting back together. I go on to the dining room and Valerie is there and she is pregnant. Her breasts are large and fulsome and she is dressed very pretty in a brightly colored peach dress. I am glad they are back together and wonder if it will work. Probably it will because she is pregnant again. (139 words)

I am showing a young woman how to take control of her life. I am steering a long, skinny boat through difficult waters, that happen to be sort of in a house, as I steer around furniture and stairs and things. I'm pretty good at it. I stand in the front and pole the boat through. Later I am going to wash myself and decide to use the sink, not the bathtub, and lather up my hands and arms and under my pits and realize this is a very effective way to get clean. I look in the mirror and see a man's face. He's a bit plump, white with reddish curly hair. I am surprised. The mirror is mostly steamed up and I scrunch down to see myself more clearly in a clear piece of mirror. Then I see some clothes have fallen in the sink. I get them out, but they are soaked: a black full skirt, a teal blue blouse, etc. Before all this, I was getting up to go to a meeting and realized the time had changed an hour but we hadn't set the clocks, so I was probably late for the meeting. I look at different clocks and ask a woman if she knows if we change them forward or backward. She didn't know. Then later, I am walking toward a house. I am successful and someone, a young woman, asks if I would ever marry. I laugh. "Why should I?" Jerome is walking by me and is very attracted, as I am independent, powerful and good at what I do. I am walking with another man he knows, and he uses that as an excuse to walk with us. He is attracted to me. (291 words)

I am in a room that is lovely and spacious, an old-fashioned fraternity kind of room, windows, etc., but the entire room is cluttered with glassware, red glasses, dishes, etc. It is very pretty, but there is not much room to just be. I am in a bed with a woman roommate. I am smoking two very long cigarettes. I hold one and smoke the other and then switch. I have trouble keeping them from falling in the bed and starting a fire. The cigarettes are slim, long and silver in color. It's time to get up. I go on out and now I am with two men in a sort of room. They are my roommates, but they are sort of strangers. We're in this "room" until our regular room is ready. Finally it is ready, room 406. The man goes ahead. He asks if I need help walking or carrying my things. I say no. He goes around the corner and now I am alone and wondering why I didn't say yes, I could use help. I ask directions of the room and see a tall four-story building of hotel rooms and they point to the 4th floor. I start walking. Somewhere in there, I call a lawyer, or threaten to call a lawyer.

Rochelle and I (both walking) are investigating a man who publicly displays his full, erect penis. He calls it public cocking. Rochelle goes into the garage room of his house where orgy stuff is going on. I hang out outside, not really wanting to see. He's quite proud of his abilities. I look and see a large, erect penis. I see a wood pile with what looks like a carcass of a deer, but part human laying on it, no skin, and from the waist down only muscle showing. (89 words)

I'm in a car, in the front seat, and talking with a cousin. We like each other and are laughing. I see a short cousin who I don't like coming toward the car. He wants to kiss me. He gets in the driver's side. I am in the middle and he tries to grab me and kiss me. I "playfully" say "ugh" and make jokes and squirm away. He really is annoyed at me and wants to connect. He's jealous of the sweet camaraderie with my other cousin. With the kissing cousin is another man I don't like who is building a square wooden box in the front seat in the driver's side and he's making rude remarks and leering. Later, I get out and go to where the short cousin is now seated on a couch. The cousin is tow headed and holds in his lap two sweet tow headed children, obviously his. I smile at the children because they are so cute and reluctantly smile at the cousin because he's being sweet and fatherly to them. He goes to put them down for their nap. The cousin hopes this has impressed me and I want to move away from him. Dovre is around. We are going somewhere. Dora is there somewhere. Maybe we are going shopping. (218 words)

Jake is driving. We are in the M City back roads area and probably going to his house. He's all locked in and driving fast and I say, "Hey, come on. If you want to commit suicide go ahead, but don't take us with you." He gets mad at me and yells, "Leave me alone. I just don't want to talk about it." He's very angry and teary. I feel very touched by his pain. I try to be honest and share that it's been years since I've been in relationship. No one wants me. Maybe I'm ugly, or too hard to live with or maybe it's the disability, I don't know, but it's lonely. I empathize with his feelings right now. We have a heart-to-heart talk. It is intense and I'm touched by his powerful pain and loneliness. (139 words)

I had managed to send up my own space ship five days ago, and Lucy and maybe Merle were in it. I am excited and anxious for them to return so I can find out how the adventure went. Maybe they will land today or tomorrow. I feel proud of my accomplishment. I'm kind of sorry I didn't go and excited about when and if they return. I hope I didn't send them to a doomed ending.

I am in a group of people and I want them to read my play, the new one I just wrote, something about sex and men and women and how they relate. They start reading it and I walk around listening and noticing that no one really listens or understands my unusual scene breaks. Finally, the man stops reading but the play is only half done and I ask him to continue reading. He says, "Naw, it's boring and besides someone said this must have been written by a fat old woman, because it puts down men and sex." I try to convince him to read the rest because then it will all balance out and they will see, but he won't. I walk over to where Sherry Lady is seated and try to talk with her. No dice. (139 words)

I am upset because sometime today I am supposed to be in a play but I can't remember when and where, so I call Blake to find out, but he's out of the office. I try to tell the secretary, but I can't even remember the name of the play, much less my lines. I feel some anxiety about my unpreparedness. A man then shows up and it's sort of Blake. The play has been postponed and I am very relieved. Now I see Merle is doing his comedy routine in front of a crowd in a bar and I go in to watch. All the people are crowded into one half of the room, on the side we're on. The other half is empty. I come up close to Merle, near the side of his wheelchair, and suddenly his fairly normal arm and hand reach down and grab my foot and tickle it. I hate being tickled and I squirm and yell, "Stop it! Stop it!" I am angry at him and he laughs and says, "At least you can feel it." I say, "No, that's not a good thing! It's worse than pain." Later, Charla and I go to a bar where I will perform. I go to find a place to sit and three women crowd around me. One is demanding to know what my disability is. She's very curious. I say, "Wait a minute. Go sit there and I'll answer these other women's questions and then I'll answer yours." She goes and sits. Meanwhile a Blake-type person is flirting with me and I am pleased he's sitting near me, behind where I'm sitting. He had asked me some pathetic question about my disability and I had impressed him by saying I was the performer here. I answer the old woman's question. I advise her to get a medical dictionary and refer to it. She's not to happy with this general answer, but leaves. I need to go to the bathroom, so I go to find it, saying, "I hope I don't find some sleazy guys here." I see a door and realize it's the men's room. I joke that I'd really find some sleazy ones there. I find the women's room and peek in. It's filthy. There are men in there too as well as women. I decide I'll wait and try to get back to my seat. The place is crummy and scary now and there is a boss that will try to cheat me. I just want to get out without getting Charla or myself hurt. The man, Blake, has moved and I feel sad, but realize he moved to get a better place to watch me. I decide to leave and go back where the man who pays me is, near the filthy restrooms. He counts out 57 dollars, a pathetic amount and an obvious cheat. To his surprise, I grin and say, "Thank you." I'm just pretending to be happy so I can get out alive and then call the police and tell on them. I get out and Blake is there and he decides he needs to go to the bathroom. He gets in line and for reasons I don't recall, I decide to go back and go to the bathroom in the sleazy place. I get there and the man at the counter decides to return Charla and my things (coats and things). I am surprised. He tosses them to me one at a time. The last one is my jacket which has an American flag part sewn on the front right side (left as I look at it). I squeal and say, "Oh, darn." He asks what the problem is. I look again and it is gone. I say, "I thought I saw an American flag sewn on my jacket, but I was wrong." (645 words)

I'm in a room with a good-looking Rock Hudson like man. He's sort of a guest. I leave him sitting on a chair as I go to find the swim pool. I want to swim, but I see it is empty. The men are working on some power lines or water lines and have turned the water off temporarily, all except the ocean, of course. It is lapping up to the edge of the pool. I see the square metal cage-like thing where the men are working in the shallows of the ocean. Later the water is back in the pool and I think of swimming then, but remember the water needs to stand for awhile to let the bacteria or something leave. Bonnie is there somewhere. I return to my guest. I see a book and start explaining to him that this lists all the different auto dealers and their employees. "For example," I say, "suppose you have a Chevrolet and want to call them to fix your car." I open to that page. I see lists of names. I point to a small list, the first one on the page and say, "...If you want to call an exec, you look him up on this page, but you wouldn't want an exec fixing your Chevy, so look up the mechanics." I see the name Chris D. and ask Jock's daughter if it is any relative to her. Then I say, "Of course not, with the name D., your name is S." I have some errands to run and comment that I saw the interest rate at the bank was lower. He is hurt that I went to the bank and didn't even ask if he could go along. I say, "Well, we can go tomorrow if you like." Then I look at my appointment book. I see I am going to have my car tuned, and the mechanic is named Chris D. What a coincidence. I also have a swim down in the book. (336 words)

I am a fast runner and live in a communist country. I am a young boy. I must get on a truck that is crossing the border to freedom. Everyone is getting on the truck. I am one of the last ones and as I try to crawl up the railed sides, the guard says it's too late, no more room. He won't let me on. I plead, hanging on and at the last second force myself on as the truck speeds off. He was going to toss me off the truck, but doesn't, now that it is moving. I clutch my $7.00 in my right hand. It is all I own. (112 words)

I am in a room with C. dept. people like Judith and Dylan. They are like the Merton Circle. It's my sort of living room. There is a cat, and a Charla like small girl. Later there are two men who are aggressive and pushing us around. A Jerome-type man is from the military and he picks one of the men up easily and holds him up so his feet are off the floor. This makes the men realize what strength and expertise he has. I had been feeling strong anger at them, but now feel safer because Jerome will protect me, but then as I stand next to Jerome and he stands watching, the two men go to a phone and call for reinforcements. Now we're really in trouble. We don't do anything about it but watch. The feeling of anger is very strong. (145 words)

I own a hotel, and a prince and his family want to buy it. He comes in and looks kind of silly in a red, ornate uniform with his hair messed up. He is also selling vacuum cleaners and he demonstrates one for me. He tries to vacuum up green cat shit and fur balls. I am disgusted at that stuff being on my floor and vaguely think of Ellie. The gunk clogs up the vacuum. I decide to buy some of his vacuums because it's cheaper to do that than sell the hotel. I go on to another room. The royal family will join us for a lunch. There is a square table with four panels that make the table longer. They fold in and out. I need to go to the bathroom. I go down the hall even though I know there is a bathroom off the room I was in, but I don't want to use that one, perhaps because it's closer to where people are, perhaps my mother. (172 words)

Another woman and myself are standing up beside a seated man. I hold a paper and the two of us are reciting a long list of rhyming things with lots of numbers on them to the man. The woman on my right knows them by heart and I sort of know them but mumble along, looking at the paper often. One line is that some people did not believe us that they thought we had sold them a bill of goods with the Tenemen square, one long yard (the whole nine yards). We looked at the word Tenemen to double check. Yes, it was the right word. (107 words)

I have a little table top desk thing that I use to paint and so on and it is wobbly. I ask this British man if he could fix it. He happily says he can. He fixes it as I ask him questions like where in England did he live. He said he lived in boarding schools. I say, "I'm sorry. That must have been hard for you, lonely." He smiles and agrees. Now that it's fixed, I decide to paint a picture. I wonder what picture to do. He smiles and says, "Why not a picture of me in a wedding, my wedding?" I laugh derisively and say, "HAA! Never. But I'll do one of you in a wedding." He wants it to be a picture of the two of us at our wedding. He likes me. He says his name is Ringo and I think that rhymes with Bingo, my name. (153 words)

I am in bed, lying down because I have a slight cold and I'm tired. I'd been working, paper work or learning French and had suddenly run out of energy. I'm laying on my tummy. Dan comes by. I am glad to see him but the timing isn't all that good. I get up and we go into the next room, a sort of living room (maybe a hotel). He's sympathetic and wants me to get well. Now I'm standing in front of a window and the devil himself comes to me through the window and bites and holds my right arm as I hold it straight out to the side. I am paralyzed with disgust, but I realize I must go through this to be better. It feels like something horrible, partly sexual, is possessing me and I stoically stand there and endure it. Finally, it is enough and I fall back on the floor, on my back. The devil is gone and I am relieved. (167 words)

I am at a conference, looking for my NLP group. I peek into a side room, one step up and ask a man if this is the group (maybe dream group). He says no, they are in the main room. I look for them. I find some computers that belong to some other organization, a commercial something, and I decide to use their computer to write up my dreams. I do that, feeling a little guilty and hope they don't catch me. I get a little greedy and want to print out the stuff I typed in, or all that work would go to waste since I'd have to go home and type them in again. So I try to print it out and I see it is spitting out envelopes with small portions of the dreams on each envelope. What a waste of paper. So I stop the operation and look at all the buttons trying to get the printer to use the paper instead of the envelopes. There are lots of buttons. Nothing seems to work. It's 10 to 5:00 and I have an hour's drive home and I have to be there by 7:00 for the women's Merton's meeting at my house. I feel rushed and yet stubborn, yet I keep trying. Finally I ask two Asian students (one male, one female) if they can help. She tries to help, but doesn't know much! She does point out the tractor buttons on the side and I push the holes of the paper over the buttons. It still doesn't work. I ask a general question to aid the students, "Can anyone help me work this?" A man offers to help. He says I'm trying to print on the wrong layer of paper. It should be the paper on the bottom. I try it and it starts printing. We walk away and he likes a book I have in my hand and wants it in exchange for his help. I am annoyed. I just got that book at a used book store. It's about education and parenting children. I don't want to give up, the book and don't really want to pay him. (364 words)

I come home to my apartment after being gone a week (perhaps Xmas at M City.) Dovre is there. I see the place is a mess. I need to find something and can't, too much stuff to look through. I then see a huge turkey on the kitchen counter. It is bubbling with toxic bacteria because it was left out all week and uncooked. What a waste. I tell Ellie to throw it out. I am annoyed with her for leaving it out. I ask what this huge boxed set of food stuff is from. She says it's from _____. I start looking at what's in it.

I am trying to help a small boy who has a severed artery in the crook of his right arm. I hold it, hoping to stop the bleeding. We are walking and nearing an old abandoned trailer house where nurses work. I'm going to stop in and let them help, but we pass and now it's my arm and I lift the bandage and see the number 1112 in red. The number is the pin pricks of the needle (where the needle went in to draw blood) and the red is the blood starting to well up again. I think the bleeding is nearly done, so I don't stop by at the trailer house. (114 words)

I am a young boy and I see the bad man who wants to steal the statues of a god and a goddess. The statues are very special. They come alive. I hide them up a tree, like figurines, and hope he doesn't see them. We almost make it, but they start moving and open their eyes and so he sees them. He puts them in a truck or the trunk of a car. They slither out, moving across the ground and yet still frozen in their stature forms. I hide them in a house and the bad men are all over searching. (103 words)

I am the wife of a Frank Sinatra man, rich and uncaring. He has a mistress and he's getting ready to go play golf with her. I am standing upstairs in our mansion looking out the large and spacious windows to see where he'll go because then I can go off and have my affair with this man. I decide to foul up his affair and go out and say, "Where are you going?" He has to lie and I feel pleased with myself. I point out that he leaves muddy tracks on the carpet. I then go to his young mistress and invite her to come with me to watch a boxing match. She agrees, not knowing what else to do and follows me. I go into an older house and start to walk upstairs. She is me now. She points out my own feet make smaller muddy tracks on the carpet. I show her two choices, a sharp metal pointy thing or a less dangerous one. I want us to see "real" boxing where men hurt each other for real and there is blood. She doesn't want to see that at this. (194 words)

I am in a cafeteria of a school. You have to purchase the meal all together. I say, "But I don't want all of it. I only want two pieces of bacon." The man at the cash register is annoyed with me. I say, "I think you should only pay for the part you eat." He is adamant. I refuse to comply. My way makes more sense. I decide to leave and go to the movies. I am talking to Merle. He has seen the movie. He liked it. A man who might be gay says I will love the hero. He is very feminine (like he is saying "a hunk" or beautiful). (113 words)

An older man lets me come live in his home. I am a young woman and my child is Charla. We move in and he shows me the rooms. I feel like a visitor. He sits on the couch and I lay down with my head on his lap. He is kind, but I feel on guard. I get up and he says this is the room. I look around. I am thinking that his wife liked it like this and I must not say what I really feel about it, because it will offend him or hurt his feelings. He asks me what I think about the furnishings and this huge painting he has. I look at the gold, old couch and the garish huge painting. I pause, thinking that his wife must have had meaning for each thing, because the interior design wasn't following a school of thought I could see. I look at the painting. I say, "I don't like it. It's ugly." He smiles happily. It was a test and I passed. Now he goes outside. I call for Charla. She comes down the stairs and there is a small baby there too, maybe a year and a half old. I go outside to see where the old man is. He is seated, resting in his back yard as a woman and a man are riding mowers and cutting the rich, full, green grass. When he sees me, he hurriedly gets up and gets on a rider mower too and helps cut the grass. I let the baby and Charla play in the yard as I look around. I see that it's a large, square yard that ends abruptly on the left side at a hedge. The left side is just a thin strip of lawn. Beyond the yard is a dry and brown landscape, obviously without care or water, somewhat like M City. I notice the contrast between the lush yard and the surrounding landscape. Then I look for Charla and see her in a tree eating something. I get concerned. I call her to me and demand to know what's in her mouth. I see a long, thin thing like are on oak or some kind of tree that may grow nuts. I want her to open her mouth and she stubbornly refuses. I pry her mouth open and find, instead of the horse chestnut things, a bunch of small plastic packages that sewing things come in. I pull them out saying, "You could swallow these things and get sick. Don't put these in your mouth." I take them back to the porch where a box is that the sewing things belong in. I replace them, hoping the old man doesn't notice. He comes up and sees, but is not concerned. (467 words)

I am riding a bicycle with a man. We each have our own bikes. We are mountain biking in the wilderness. With fairly good ease, we are biking up steep hills, covered with trees and underbrush. As we near the top, he laughs and says we can take the easy way. A rough gravelly road is there. We get on it and reach the top. Here we see a TV monitor and it indicates a hard hat area. This means there is construction going on and we peer over the edge and look down into a mountainous valley to see men building and clearing. We see terraces being cleared. This is a terrible use of the wilderness environment. A group of people come up near us to sing protest songs, songs of protestations. It's like a church choir. Rochelle decides to join them. She says with confidence that she will have taken over by the end of the song. She joins the bass section. I listen and sing along from my position near the edge where I can see the men working. I then decide to join with the choir. I go over and see the people are standing on a rock platform and I can't see how to get up there to be with them. So I decide to stand near them in front, dead center, I notice wryly. I then scoot over to the side. Rochelle does her power thing and takes over the bass section as she said she would. Then we go back to the same position near the edge. They are having a meeting. Rochelle and I are strategizing. We decide we can't win the whole battle and get them to stop construction, so we try to suggest they make their places wheelchair accessible. We even are conciliatory there and say, "OK, not the whole place, but at least ramps instead of stairs." Lucy joins us; she is angry and yelling and we try to shush her so she won't spoil the work we've already accomplished. Now we try to get her to get in the cart. I'm in the back seat behind the driver's side and I call her to me. She is being an ingenue and not paying attention to the whole picture. (380 words)

I am trying to get a hotel room and being demanding. I'm not getting my way. Now I see a scrooge with alien-like eyes and he's really self-centered. Derwood Kirby lost his job at the factory and Scrooge says, "Well then, you can choose any thing you want from my things." Derwood is touched and chooses his favorite. Scrooge says, "Good, I'll be happy to give it to you at 1 percent off the normal price." Derwood leaves in disgust at the insensitivity of Scrooge. Later, I see me on an English cable TV show. I am wearing my half glasses and doing Evangeline faces. I have fat wrinkles under my chin. I look old. I keep swiveling my head back and forth like I'm on a couch between two people and trying to give eye contact with them both as I brightly talk on in my interview. Then I do a Evangeline shtick and am funny. (157 words)

I dream something that I interpret means I must kill the mother inside me (the negative mother). Then I dream something about that not being right. I must let the negative mother die. That is better. Then I am an older woman who calls my family together to announce that I am running for the Senate. The president of the United States called me and asked me to serve. The women in the family are happy. My husband and son or son-in-law are unhappy, especially when I answer the question of how much will I earn. The answer is $60,000. This is more than my husband makes. I hope he will be able to handle this. (116 words)

I am in danger. There are aliens and we must run. A woman says, Synchronize your watches." I see mine is set now for 10 of 1:00. We take a deep breath and start walking briskly down the sidewalk. Now we must do what is called chaining. There are fringes of styrofoam-like curls like packing material on our ankles and when we come to a doorway or checking area, we must give up one chain. The door was coming frequently (like taxing booths), the paths are branching out and soon we will lose all our chains and then God knows what will happen to us. I think I carry a child or two in my arms. We are like fleeing Jews. [BL] (121 words)

I am having a bowel movement, after being constipated for a while. I squat over a hibachi thing next to the toilet and push. A hard piece comes out. It falls and gets on the carpet. Some more follow and now I have to pick them up and put them in the toilet. Charla comes by, eating a roll, and she thinks this will be fun and picks up some of the round balls of shit to help me. I say, "Oh no! put that down. Don't touch the roll now. Go wash your hands and don't put them in your mouth." I get up to walk her to a place she can wash her hands when the toilet starts acting strange like it's going to overflow. We back away. It disgorges lots of shit and water noisily like an agitated washing machine gone mad. I go grab a telephone, but the line is dead, so I go out into the hall down to the next classroom and say to some people working in there, "The toilet is overflowing, and the telephone doesn't work. This is an emergency." Several of the men come following me back to where the toilet is. Joe K from the community college is right behind me. I say, "There it is," only it's perfectly quiet now, but it has moved to another spot. How can it do that? I say, "Look out, there's lots of shit around." He laughs and says, "There sure is!" "It stinks," I say. He agrees cheerfully. He then decides to flush it to see if it still does it. It rumbles and we back away and soon muddy brown water is being thrown out. More stinky shit! Now I'm backed to the entrance door and Tyler and others join us. I say, "What a metaphor! I can throw a lot of shit and it won't hurt, just stink! and the phone doesn't work either." Tyler and I smile at the wonderful metaphors. (332 words)

I am kneeling on the floor where there is a terrible mess of cheese pieces and slices all over and paper and stuff. The kid that made the mess refuses to clean it up so I, in exasperation, decide to do it. The door opens and Andrea comes in and says, "I've had a very bad day, but I am managing and everything will be all right." She looks down at me and sees I've had an equally bad day. I gather up the stuff and carry it into the kitchen. We and other women are talking about a trip of some kind, packing for it and suddenly it's time to go. I encourage a woman to go spontaneously without taking anything, leaving the book behind. She hesitates and then does. It is freeing, and scary. I am now walking down a flight of stairs, perhaps carpeted, and telling someone, perhaps Ellie, that my mother and Aunt Naomi were the bossy, controlling ones and Millie and Bonnie were the fun-loving, playful ones. Too bad. Ellie lays out a row of objects on the stairs to demonstrate this concept. Now I have no place to step, I am blocked, so she has to move some of them so I have a place to step. (213 words)

I am a counselor and at a school. I am working on a case. I go to the administrator's office and he tells me of a woman student that went crazy, screaming and saying things. I take notes and then interview the boyfriend of the husband. He tells me something and I say, "Uh huh. I see. That explains it" (over the phone). I hang up and tell the man that the woman had had a series of tough stresses and when she entered the classroom, the racial slur of the white male student was the straw that broke the camel's back. She snapped. She'll be all right now. He is very impressed with my skills and we start to walk across campus. The boyfriend says, "I want to tell you what she said." I say, "You cannot. It would be unethical to break confidence with a client. If it were me alone, you could tell, because I'm a professional." He really wants to tell, but doesn't. We walk down some curvy stairs. I tell the administrator man of my troubles with the men I work with. They don't accept me. They have some way of deciding who gets space and time and won't let me in on it. I lay tiredly on a round canvas frame where a partial design is rug hooked in. I sigh and say, "Sometimes I think I'll just jump in and take it." Later, the man is sort of Capt. Picard and we have gone off together for a vacation. A woman (me) is cooking or stirring up a special dough. A stick like a wooden hair comb made of twigs is placed in the middle of the dough and the new ingredients can only be poured on the one side. It is an old tradition and is passed on from one to the other (generation, perhaps). He and I are going to have a wonderful time seeing the sunrise and set and swimming and loving. (332 words)

In the first dream there is a Russian and I am an American and he likes me and I like him. We flirt and enjoy each other. Later, there is another man and I want to feel the same way with him, only it isn't working out. It's boring. We are in a car and I want to find some food to eat, like a sack lunch or picnic. I find some stuff between the door and the front seat, but it isn't all that appetizing. I notice a high wind coming and we run for an old dilapidated barn for cover. We get in and there is no way to close an old broken wooden window, no glass. We go to a corner and sit on a hay-strewn bench. I look out and see entire groves of trees being smashed by the force of the wind. Fortunately this is barren country and not much around to be destroyed. I try to feel good about cuddling up with this guy, but it is boring. There is nothing in the barn but us, the wooden bench and some bits of hay. (190 words)

I want to publish my book and some sleazy agent man is going to help me. It's going to cost. Some woman says I spent ____ money on my book and I said, "By the time we print it, it will cost us about 5 or 6 thousand dollars." It's a sort of one-upmanship. Then there is a series of shootings. One man shoots another and two men stand off and fire at each other point blank. I am appalled. One man is my friend. He's laying face down in a pool of blood. A woman cries and wants to help, but is afraid to touch him. I kneel down and inspect the back for a wound. I find none, so I turn him over and see a small bullet hole (22 caliber) near the base of the throat (where a tracheotomy might be). It is bleeding just a little. I am relieved. Then I see a hole near the chest and try to stop the bleeding. He will live. (170 words)

I am at Grandma Mildred's house. They are remodeling. They are going to make a huge bathroom where the second living room was. A white pipe is run up high on the wall and a huge tub is already installed. I say, "This will be great, now that it's just the two of you, but what if one of you dies and then it will be too big for just one?" I go into the kitchen. A woman and a man, both young, are passing a small feminine black hat back and forth to one another in a sort of ritualistic way. It is on a long white piece of crochet lace. I encourage them to do this ritual while they talk. The boy/man doesn't want to; he thinks it's silly. The young woman steps outside, perhaps she hears a noise. I follow. We are out in the wild fields now and I see some men, bad men, and they are trying to kill another man. Three of them have him down on his back and are choking him. I realize I am witnessing a murder. I say somewhat mildly, "You had better let him go because there are witnesses now." They hesitate and then let go, but I am worried. They could kill me. I look at them closely so I can remember details to tell the police. I say, "They are late 20's, early 30s. One man is in a white t-shirt and has a slight pot belly. They are very dangerous." They move away to regroup and the woman and I decide we'd better flee. Now we run and they chase and somehow I'm in an underground room with crates and boxes and we run and run. We climb a metal ladder thing attached to a wall and there are things from our car there and I'm trying to take these things with us but I must abandon them One rolls and drops, making a loud sound which gives us away and the men come running. We crawl up into a warehouse room and crawl into a cardboard box and hide. They are searching and are very close. It's almost like we are out in the open, pretending to be covered in the box and hoping they don't see us. As they talk, they seem to be moving closer and closer until it seems inevitable they would stumble on us, but they don't. One man crawls up high and swings across the room on a white rope thing. Now there is a tiny, bald-headed child, a child of one of the men, standing nearby staring at us. He/she sees us and we hold our breath, waiting to be told on. But she doesn't. The father of the child says to her, "We have to go now, to find those women, but you have to stay here and you better be good." It seems cruel and abusive. They leave, going down the ladder we had come up on, shutting and locking the child in this room with us. Then the child comes directly to us and then shows us a huge grain or freight elevator. We get in and ride it down. We see my red car and run for it. The men are chasing us. We get in the car, I have the key and we drive (I drive like hell). They are in a car in hot pursuit. It's dark, the road/trail is dirt and skinny and curvy. I drive fast and furious. They're right on our tail. Then they are in front of us and headed right for us to crash or block us and I swerve and go up a steep embankment, up onto railroad tracks. Very clever, they think. They turn and pursue. Now we are driving down the tracks, hoping a train doesn't come at us and bushes on either side of the road so we couldn't exit if we wanted to. Now we are crossing a train trestle and yep, there's a train coming. We get off the trestle at the other end and down a steep embankment just at the last second and the men don't. They crash in flames. We stop running. Now we are out of the car in the bushes and I see flames, a wild fire. I say to the man, "Let's get going." He says we should stay. I ask, "Why? The fire is coming it will come here and we'll burn." He says, "We must stay here." I want to leave, but I don't want to abandon him. I say, "What if it does come here?" He says, "It won't if this is kept mowed down and the fire will not come here to us." It's coming, I can see it. Now I feel real fear because the men are dead and spirits now and that makes them more dangerous. They have stronger powers and are invisible. I want out of there. I say, "What if it comes anyway?" He says, "It's OK, I have poison. I can give you some and we'll die." Just then a woman with dark hair, with mime white face and in a white linen business tailored suit, walks elegantly with a dead pan face toward us. Her face is long and angular. I am afraid!!

I am in the passenger side of a car and we stop to see a piece of furniture in a garage sale on the side of the road. It is a wooden display case that has rows of small drawers or boxes that rotate like a display watch case. I am intrigued and think it will be perfect for my small things and jewelry. I see a large price tag on it that says $89. I think I can afford that so we get out to look. The family that is selling it is very excited and bring me lots of accessory things that go with it free of charge, a large, plastic yellow top which I think looks cheap, and so on. I decide to buy it. Now I see a small chocolate Eskimo pie man who is going out to explore the world. He hops along and I sort of follow. He decides to go into a cafe where this man has gone in. A small tiny woman his size comes out and says, "Oh, you are my size." She likes that. He goes on. Inside, he hops into a refrigerated display case, glass, and stands with other stick figure candies. I now go to find the man. I see him settling in at a table and I go sit at the table next to him, pretending I don't see him. He sits down next to me, surprised. He is tall, lanky and dark-haired.

Two men, like beat poets of the 50's, are traveling and I am a reporter who comes to interview them. He tells me about their life. How they are free as birds and only have relationships with women who know the rules. It's only short-term, sex and drugs, going from one woman to the next, no commitments. A young, dark-haired woman comes up to him. He's in the pickup getting ready to drive on to the next place. She has a paper to be autographed and asks to come along. He pulls out a dictionary to look up the words to say to explain the rules to her, like she speaks a different language. He explains, pointing to the words in a dictionary. She smiles and speaks plain English, agreeing with the rules. She'll do anything to be able to be with them for a while. Now the other man, more flambuoyant, isn't there and the one man is driving and I'm in the passenger side, talking to him, still interviewing. But now the man asks me quietly and with feeling what I'm really doing here. Why do I go around interviewing people? I say, "Searching, trying to find someone who is truly unique." I say, "I can't find anyone because they might have unique qualities on the psychological level, like different life experiences and different parental values etc., but deep down, we are all the same. No one is unique." I smile at him and say, "You can imagine how intrigued I was by you," and I curl around him, in a hug. He thinks, as I lay my hand down near his lap, that I am about to perform manual sex and starts to automatically get ready to receive it, but then he realizes I am just hugging and cuddling and nervously asks if I want ___ a drug like cocaine. I smile and say no. I say, "I thought you were the one, but, no. I see you are not. You are the same as everyone." He smiles in recognition, sadly. "You can imagine how thrilled I am to hear this," he says. I smile. He gently places his hands over my breasts, on top of my shirt. It's a sexy gesture because you would expect him to try to fondle the breasts to get me excited, but he doesn't, he just gently pats me there. I put my hands over his in a touching gesture, and pat his hands. It's sweet, poignant and sexy. I feel a sensual pleasure. This is impossible and we both know it. I see the dirt mountainous road we are on, off in the wilderness alone. It narrows and I see ahead of us a brick wall, like a fireplace in a living room and bushes in the road. We slow down and stop. We neither of us move, because it would break the magic spell. I want us to continue getting closer. The moment freeze-frames and I wake up, feeling sweet and sad, and wanting something. (506 words)

I am on skates and I am skating down a street when I suddenly take a left turn to a curvy downhill road with a dropoff on the left side and buildings on the right. I feel apprehensive about this decision because I'm not so good at skating and I could make a mistake and go over the side, not being able to control my speed and end up going over the edge. Off I go anyway, almost against my will or better judgement. Then I see a long steep set of stairs that is like a ladder. It is so steep that I go over the edge; I hang on to the rail on my right and speedily skate from stair to stair. I am amazed I can do so well, barely managing not to fall and hurt myself. Jock is around somewhere. Maybe he's skating too. (148 words)

I go into a room, possibly a bedroom, where I find Ellie to ask her to help me out. I want to go swimming, but didn't remember to bring my swimsuit. She says, "How can you swim then?" I say, "I can borrow a t-shirt and shorts from you and swim in them." She sighs, not wanting to go to the trouble. Now I see Charla, naked, and I pat her butt and feel like I did when the children were tiny babies. The butt is so cute and soft and I feel tenderness. She grabs onto me and hugs me and we laugh. The butt is not completely like a baby's, though there are wrinkled patches like my butt. I ask Ellie to find something for me, maybe photos and I point to where they are. (137 words)

There are a bunch of tiny burros and we try to ride them. If we stay on long enough, we win a prize. The prize is permission to make love to a person of our choice, if they agree. Several men try to ride and don't make it. I manage to hang on and win. I am given a small container with birth control stuff in it. I like this one man and am shy and want to ask him, but am afraid to. I am on a bed area that belongs to my parents. Then I put a small kitten in a car where his puppy already is. I roll up the windows, being careful to position the special breathing section correctly so they can't hop out, but have holes in the glass for air to come in. I check all the windows and am closing the back trunk one when a man in a black car comes by. He wants me to go with him, but I don't. I get into the driver's seat of the car with the animals. I try to lock the door and have trouble. I try three times and get it firmly shut. I turn the key on. The gearshift is funny-looking, thick and angular. I've never driven before and am nervous. I go out into the street very carefully and slow. In the center of this dream was a part where I choose another man to make love to and get into a cubicle and we start to thump and bump when the man of my real choice is upset and tries to figure out a way to intervene. He does interrupt, maybe making a noise or sending someone in or slamming a door. I come out before the thing has gone to orgasm. (302 words)

I am at Ellie's counselor. He wants to get information from me to help Ellie. We have to make another appointment because something isn't working out for this time. I feel frustrated. I think about going across the street to do some shopping, but decide not to. Now, I am driving. I decide after I start driving that I want to go to Payless and buy some things. I discover that I have gotten on the exit of the freeway and I'm going the wrong way. I stop, turn around, and try to find the way to cross the freeway and get back to the Payless store. It seems impossible. I get on the freeway going toward home, finally going the right direction, but now I'm a passenger, with Doug driving and Lydia in the middle. I see an exit and say, "Let's go here, maybe it will take us back to Payless." We turn. I deliberately give Doug the silent treatment as he is being obnoxious as usual. I really don't like him a lot. As we drive back on a highway, we are right on the edge of the ocean. Doug says, "Look how beautiful, the sun, anyway, the light." I can't help but agree. It is a wide, blue expanse of water and it's beautiful. I see a huge sign that says "Payless" off in the distance and we round a corner to discover the tiny road we are on stops abruptly at an embankment and doesn't connect with the curved road that does go to Payless. Now we are out of the car and I think about walking there, but it's a long way on arthritic feet. Doug has a tiny "6 shooter," which is even less dangerous than a 22, a pistol. A part falls out of it on the road. It's lightweight and cheap. I think he was threatening me with it. I see Uncle Dale and Aunt Bridget jogging down the road. We chat. I get angry at Doug and stand up to his silly gun threat of shooting me. I decide to leave them and the car and walk back to Payless. (360 words)

I am living in a 3-room apartment that has a downhill slope in one of the rooms. I have a sweet, chubby baby boy and I've been ill, but now I'm recovering and I get up and carry him around with me and feed him food and hug him and love him. He laughs and chuckles and is very content. I also do exercises by walking from one end of the apartment to the other, back and forth, back and forth. I look out the bedroom window and see on the hill right behind the apartment men who are camping there because they are homeless. They are on horseback and have makeshift tents. It is icy and slick outside and I step out, slide down the ramp and slide back up and back in. The letter A in fancy cursive is written in the fogged-up bedroom window. (147 words)

I am going up some stairs and then down and there is a sort of playful game going on with a man. We are mutually attracted. I ask a group of half grown boys to surround me so he can't see me and they do. I'm in the center, laughing and peeking out at him. He peeks in and sees me as I lay down on the floor, laughing. He recognized me because of my legs and feet. They were female. (81 words)

I am at a party in a rich woman's mansion. I go for a walk to find the bathroom, I go down a curved, ramped floor. I see an orchestra set up ready to play. I find the bathroom. A woman goes in and she says, "What a mess." I peek in and agree. I decide to wait. I walk on, looking for another one. I pass the orchestra and see a large carnival ride-like thing that swoops up and down and under it is a large water pond. There is a green alligator and wild cats that eat things. I think of going on the game and decide not to, those cats look vicious. I return the way I came and see a beautiful cello on the ground. I look more closely and ask the oriental man if that is a cello. He says, "Yes." I say, "It looked for a moment like a dulcimer, the color or type of wood, but I did think it was a cello." He smiles and then admires my skirt. It is a cotton wrap-around with designs and pictures that represent the history of Mexico. He is intrigued and bends down to look closely at the hem area. Suddenly, he rips off a section of the skirt and takes it. I am angry and say, "Wait, you made a hole." He ignores me. I walk on, trying to decide what to do. I decide I'll go find a policeman and return to get that piece of my skirt from him. I look at the ramp on the right, thinking of going back that way, but it looks too long and I'd get tired. So I go back the way I came up to the original level. I see Nate and feel sad and wistful. His wife is nearby and I think she may be the owner of this mansion. He stands close to me and we chit chat, but we look at each other with longing. She stops by and chats and walks out the door. Nate is going with her and he pauses to say goodbye like to an acquaintance, but we stand close and I brush my hand over his just to touch. It is a tender, secretive moment. He goes out. I turn to rejoin the party. Now I want to go home, to the old M City house, but first the woman of the house (sort of Nate's wife) says, "Why don't you take this carpet, for Charla." I agree and together we roll it up and she hands me pieces of tape and I wrap it around and around to secure the roll of carpet. Then Nate comes up and smiles gently and says, "Why don't I help carry that for you." I know this means he'll come in and we'll be lovers again. I want to resist, sort of, but I don't. The woman steps away and Nate says, "First, put this rose in my hair." He kneels like some ritual thing and I pluck a white rose or two from the table decoration and stand behind him to place the roses in the ponytail of long brown hair. It is touching and tender, and a ritual. I pat his head, maybe kissing it lightly. He says, "Move the family thing." I look to the table and see a big plate of food on a holder warmer dish and realize he means to move the plate so he can put the carpet roll on it for a moment before he heaves it on his shoulder, and we walk down the road to the M City house and some alone time for ourselves to make love. The carpet is short and small. (624 words)

I am on a bus as a sort of head resident type. Lots of things happen and we are headed home. It is late and I am very tired. I fall into bed, exhausted. I live in a Uni house kind of residence. This one morning I feel better and I walk down to breakfast. It feels wonderful. I don't know how long I'll be able to keep it up, but for now it feels grand. A man I like comes in and sees me walking. He's so happy, he and I hug, standing up and kiss and now it's like we have declared our love to each other. We are interrupted with the news that I am going to be the dance queen tonight, like homecoming queen for the prom or something. This is going to be a long night and I wonder if I will be able to manage being so active on my feet so much. I have to dance with every man. The older man who runs the place insists I walk across the gym and stand at the edge of the bathtub and then walk all the way across the gym to where a long table is. I protest this will hurt me too much, but he insists. I do it and the young men line up one at a time to dance with me. They each bring a card with some phrases written on them, like cards you get with flowers. A young man announces each one. One man and I dance. Then I have to walk back to the bath tub area. This goes on for awhile and I want my loved one to come dance with me before it's too late and I can't move. Again I'm at the table and I just refuse to do the long walk. I go straight out to the dance floor. The older man is angry and insists I do it the "right" way. I mouth the words "fuck off" and go back to the table. The announcing man says, "Did I hear swear words?" I say, "You didn't HEAR them!" Then the music is wild and Latin and I start dancing toward the center of the floor all by myself. A woman comes up to me and says, "This will be terrible." I ask, "What will?" She says, "You're older than us and you'll end up living here and then you'll be 85 years old and our children will see you and be afraid." I say, "You mean like I'll be the old witch of the village?" She says, "Yes." This upsets her. I'm a little annoyed myself at her. I see a man dancing across the floor and he's wonderful at it. He's dark and Latin. I dance to him and it's so graceful, like we're skating only we're in stocking feet (nylons for me). We glide and swirl around and now his girlfriend is jealous and tries to cut in. The three of us do a kind of duck and pull dance. Then I glide out of it and they go off. The older man has shoved the big bathtub over to the center so I can still do the ritual, but not walk so far. I smile at his tenacity. He glares at me because he had to compromise. I go stand in front of the tub. There is lots of steaming warm water in it and I feel my aching, limping joints start to feel better by standing in the warm steam. Behind the tub is a young man, seated. He has a bright tow head blonde crew cut. He makes a smart remark and I grab him by the hair and pull him to standing like he's a naughty little boy. He grimaces. Now I hear my love. He's drunk and he's coming to the dance to start a food fight with catsup and mustard to break up the dance so I can get away and off my feet. It's a rescue. I catch his eye and he looks at me lovingly but drunk. He's wearing black pants. Some of the young women come up to me to help me get out before the fight gets going good. I say, "Wait, my cards and gifts. I want them." Someone goes to collect them for me and we go out. I am relieved I can soon sit down and not hurt so much, and sad I never got a dance with my love.

A beautiful Barbie doll kind of woman is laying in a coffin-like box with her lover, a beautiful man. They are going to kiss but the woman is dead, and her body begins to dissolve molecule by molecule and is absorbed into the mountain, a stone mountain in a pyramid shape. I see the blood cells in there and wonder how she can still be alive, but she is. It is necessary to get her out, the man still loves her. And through some Herculean effort, she is pulled out of the rock, molecule by molecule and put back together. I am amazed she is still alive. (107 words)

There is a bad guy that can emanate some horrible, painful sound or radiation that keeps everyone his prisoner. Just at the moment he turns it on, I as a superman kind of being disintegrate and disperse my molecules as I fly up and away. He's upset I got away. But now I must go back and fight him in order to save my family, now frozen in his power. I go, via instructions from some feminine voice, to a platform up in the clouds and there are some remote control-like game boards in a basket. I pick up one. The voice says, "This one can be adapted well." I look at it closer. It is a chess game, electronic. I say "Ah, the good old chess game," satisfied it can be modified to fight this powerful man and save my family. I turn it over and look at the back side of it and see the tiny shapes of the black "men" or pieces. I want to review the rules of how they are allowed to move. [BL] (178 words)

There are three tanks of fish in this living room. I go look. I am holding a tiny rectangle that is maybe a 1/4 inch thick plastic enclosed piece with tiny fish in it. I wonder how they can be still alive, there's no way to get food to them. I realize I haven't feed the fish in the three big tanks for years. I see large goldfish that appear dead, floating on their sides. I get the fish food and pour some on the top of the water and the fish swarm, boiling all around desperate for food. I feel really bad for them. I wonder how they survived. I see Howard's face around. Later, some child says, "The baby is hungry." I walk up some stairs and down a long hall to the back bedrooms. There are a lot of rooms. I haven't been here for a long time. Dovre as a pre-teen is with me. I find the bedroom where the baby is. She's laying on an old uncomfortable double bed. She is 3-years-old now. I am going to dress her and I'm looking for matching shoes that will fit, but can't find a matching pair. They are all colorful plastic see-through bootie slippers. I say, "It's about time we moved you into a better room. You're a big girl now. You aren't a baby." It's like a graduation statement and I make it seriously. I take her by the hand, and we walk back down the long hall with up and down stairs in it toward the front rooms where I live. She says, "How come I haven't been here very much? It's important to be here." I say, "I don't know, but now you will live here." I feel badly I've neglected her. (298 words)

I decide to invite friends and family over for Thanksgiving and am preparing a big dinner. My mother is in the kitchen fixing food, I am scurrying around getting extra chairs. The house is big, with lots of long tables end to end down some long hall. I am walking and enjoying it. Rochelle and another woman in a wheelchair comes. I look at Rochelle's new wig, brown and kind of ugly looking. I compliment her and say it's pretty. She smiles and they go sit and wait as I am busy with greetings. I see uncles and cousins and then my Grandmother Agnes. I am very happy to see her and hug her a long hard time. "I'm so glad to see you again," I say. She says, "Do you remember Sandy?" I think her son. I laugh and say, "Oh yes, when we were children, I was called Sandy and I named him that." I go on and finally find a place at the far end of this endless feast. We get turkey and potatoes and there is plenty, but I realize we didn't get the special treats, the cranberry sauce, the salads and biscuits and so on, so I say to a woman down the table, "Could you ask the captain (of an airplane) to pass down the sauce?" She's embarrassed to do it. I ask the co-pilot to do it. He hesitates and I get annoyed and say, "Oh, for goodness sakes, I guess I'll just do it myself!!" I get up, which shames the woman, who tries to ask the Capt., who ignores the request. I walk passed him and find salads and jellos and biscuits and cake and lots of cream cheese special dishes and start gathering them up; apple butter, applesauce. I see co-worker Gordon and clap him happily on the shoulder and say, "I must have sat at the wrong end of the table. We didn't get all this." He smiles and we joke about how I'm just a complainer. A woman who is gathering up the leftovers says, "What are you going to do with all this?" I say, "Don't worry, it won't go to waste. I'll take it to the babies in the hospital, maybe to the homeless." (378 words)

I am given the job of working a "board" sort of like at Ellie's radio station, or like a switch board. I don't get much training and I'm trying to remember the sequences. A small red light comes on and it is labeled star. I know this is a "star" message and it is important to hear it. I push some buttons hoping that would work, but it doesn't. I keep trying different sequences and objects. I remember I first have to pick up a bottle labeled "star" and put some of that substance in something. I look for the bottle. I find lots of different ones but not the right one. Red Buttons walks in and I want to talk with him. I enjoy his company but I must first finish what I'm doing. I say to him, "I'm sorry, but I'm new at this job and I have to find the star." He says "OK, but it looks like they didn't give you much training." I say, "No, only a few hours before I took over." He says, "You shouldn't have accepted that." I feel annoyed and say, "Just a minute." I climb up a bookcase-like thing to look on the top shelf. I find different bottles all just out of reach and knock a few over in my search. Some are like onion powder bottles. They are almost it, but not quite. I feel frustrated. (238 words)

Kenneth is leaning out of a window and turned around looking up to the next floor and trying to kiss a man who is leaning down toward him. I watch, surprised, because Kenneth is married to a woman. Later, I am going on a vacation. I am catching a plane. I get on and realize I have not packed a thing. I had time to do so, but somehow I didn't manage to do it. I wear a black sheath dress. I have no meds, no other clothes, no books. I wonder how I'll manage. Now I'm on a boat-like thing and it's plowing through waters that look shallow, but must have a channel deep enough in it or we wouldn't be able to move. It's time to dress for dinner and a man wants to meet me, so I open a closet and see lots of formals and fancy dresses, nothing appropriate. I look through them, but don't find anything usable.

I am at a reunion and I see Darryl. He stands near me and I can feel the same sweet sexual excitement I felt around him. He and I talk, sort of aware of the feelings but not acting on them. He then begins to kiss me and I like it very much and start to want more. I am walking and holding his arm like he is a gallant escort. He sees a friend of his and hesitates to introduce us. Perhaps he is remembering my disability and is embarrassed, but he does introduce us. The man isn't very warm. Then Darryl and I sit in a manual wheelchair. I am semi laying down in the chair and he is on top of me, kissing. I say, "We can write for awhile, but then maybe I can come to you in Texas or you can return here to me." We really want to make love now. (157 words)

I am traveling to a city in California to live. I'm driving a car that needs fixing. I am going up a hill that is so steep that I am now climbing hand over hand like a mountain climber and it is scary because I might lose my grip. A young man from the California town meets me and says, "Why did you take that way?" I say, "I don't know." So now I'm driving down a road, with curves and woods. Then we see the town, a small country town with one main street. Now I am a woman in a power wheelchair and the person coming to this town for a job is a man in a wheelchair. He says, "Are there any ramps in this town?" The man guiding us says there wasn't a one, but by tomorrow every place will have one. The young man says, "There, that's the place I'll be working," and points to a counter and a cash register, in a sort of drugstore, gift shop place, but now a sort of city picnic thing is going on and I walk down the street. I say to the young man who is wearing a leather jacket, "Come see the show." He says, "I'll be playing my guitar over there." Katrina and her son are there. She says, "They'll do magic tricks over here." We follow her and watch as she pulls out a few cheap firework tricks for her son. I sit and the young man lays down in front of me, relaxed, on the grass. I look at him and then quietly reach over and kiss him, which surprises him. I am basically inquiring if he would be receptive to this sort of thing. He squirms and says something about already having a girlfriend. I guess I'm too old for him. My feelings are not hurt; I simply asked. He's free to respond anyway he wishes. I look over to a young woman in front of him and ask with my eyes about the kiss, but we both pass on it. Now Katrina is explaining the trick, which involves 25 round, tiny disks in a pile. The son has a Bic lighter and has trouble lighting it. It clicks and clicks. I think, "I'm glad I don't do tricks that require fire, too unpredictable." (392 words)

I am called to go to Dustin Hoffman's house. He sends a limo. I sit in the back, and all the windows are smoked glass and I feel like I'm in a box. I can't see out. We get there, after I type in all the sensations I experience, like outside noises or when we round a curve in my mini computer. It'll make a great scene in a movie someday. The door opens and an older woman, an employee of Dustin's, reaches in to assist me out of the car. I am standing and a woman is on each side gripping my arms. I say, "Let go of me." They don't. I insist, getting very angry. I repeat, "Let go of me," escalating in anger, over and over. Finally I shake them off. We get in an elevator and I push #2, the usual floor I go when I visit Dustin's house. But we go up to the top floor and I see through a glass window that we are now at an attic toy room, a secret place where he is himself. I get out and Dustin dressed as a child on a small tricycle toy comes putting up. I keep trying to see him as an adult in child's clothing, but he looks like a child with an adult face. His employees are playing games with him and I feel sad for an older woman who is talking baby talk. How demeaning, but I also admire her acting abilities. Then Dustin groans in pain and lays down on the floor. I get on my knees by him and bend down and kiss him gently on the lips. He has a migraine headache and is in terrible pain. I whisper, "This had better be real, or you are dead meat." He smiles weakly, acknowledging he knows that. (309 words)

I am a leader and the chores have all been assigned. A man is supposed to do the dishes. I pass a clouded mountainside and see a yellow wooden horse, adult-sized, but like a child's toy, half out of the clouds. I call it to someone's attention. "Look at that," I say. Then it comes alive and is now a very artistic looking man in a leotard full body suit of swirling yellows and greens. He runs fast past us to my quarters. He is sneaking down the mountain to eat my food. I guess he doesn't have any up there. But the man and I have been so busy fighting or defending that the dishes haven't been done for days and he sees a bowl of cream of wheat, but no small bowls to eat out of. I look around and say, "Well, I guess we don't have any bowls left." I am annoyed with the man, because I've done all my chores and haven't nagged him, but enough is enough. I tell him he needs to get on it. I am willing to help some. I decide to give two of my paper bowls to the other man until the dishes are finally done. Now I am trying to tie a scarf around my waist like a seat belt and it is too loose. There is a dolly and a tiny baby dolly. I'm holding them and trying to tie the scarf and it is cumbersome and difficult. Finally I get the idea to knot the scarf up shorter and put the two dollies together so they can hold each other. It works, sort of, only this big bulk is still all on my lap and gets in my way. (292 words)

I am sort of a office worker or a head resident again, only Rochelle and I work together for the, whatever organization it is. I decide to start cleaning up a corner on my desk and discover lots of old things that had been around when I was head resident at Uni house. I find several dead plants. I exclaim at one, "Oh, it's dead, I think," and wonder if it got water, if it would still grow new shoots. I find some necklaces and ask if anyone knew who's they were. A woman claims them. I was kind of hoping no one would so I could have them, they were pretty. Now I'm putting piles of papers and things in boxes and going to take them home and sort them. Rochelle is seated on a couch and a woman in a wheelchair comes to the door. I am standing between them. They are role-playing talking to each other on a phone and I am coaching them. I teasingly say to the one behind the half-open door, "Now remember, you're calling your girlfriend." I feel good about being so open and friendly about her lesbianism. After they exchange a few sentences, the role play is over and Rochelle is blushing and has bright red lipstick on. She says that is hard. I agree and say, "Communication is an art form; it is hard," and encourage her to continue trying. I go on packing. I step outside and see buses arriving. Big bands are arriving for a musical evening which I'm not staying for because it will be too crowded and uncomfortable. I see a marimba band bus and think, "Maybe I will stay, after all some really good music will be here," but still I know I won't stay. A couple of the musicians call out to me for directions to the play they will play, and I ignore them, shy and not wanting to connect with them, although there is a part of me that is like a fan and wants to connect. I am sort of regretting doing this even as I continue doing it. I go back inside and think, "Maybe I'll stay." I go out to the backyard where it will be held and try to imagine it full of 2,000 people. I would have to go into the woods and pee because I'd never get through all those people to get back inside, especially in my wheelchair. I then drive my chair down a wooded path where no one is, using a small flashlight attached to my wheelchair and squat and pee. I am wearing my swirly multi-colored skirt of Uni house days. I return and go inside. No, I won't stay. I gather up some boxes, I see a t-shirt, black with a picture of me as a cheerleader in my French beret hat. I see an old wrinkled red head resident hat of Uni house, etc. I go ask a couple of young men to help me carry these boxes out. (508 words)

I am laying on the ground sort of on a picnic blanket with my sister Lydia. A good-looking man wanders by and is attracted and I am attracted to him. We start to walk along, me in a manual chair. He helps push me around. He wants to go off together with me to a motel and vacation with me. I am tempted because he's a sweet kisser and I enjoy his company and I enjoy being with someone. But if I do, it would mean that I'd have to be in my manual chair, which means he'd have to always help me. I'd lose my power, my freedom and independence. I am torn. I agree to do it. Meanwhile we have some money that really belongs to the Mafia and he suggests we just go spend it, at a $100-a-night hotel. I am unsure, this would lead to big trouble, but I follow him and do it, putting off thinking of the consequences. (164 words)

Merc and I are going in the direction of a huge wall of water. I look up and realize this is a tidal wave and it makes no sense to be moving toward it. We turn and run as fast as we can for high ground. I climb and climb until I am up on a roof area and see that I am just barely high enough. To my left now is a huge raging river of water. It's close, but I am safe. (84 words)

I am being forced to drive to California by my evil brother and his wife, my sister-in-law. I earn money either with Social Security or with my writing and they are living off what I earn. Somehow, I manage to get back in the house. I think an older sister, Margaret (elderly), makes this happen. I make a break for it and go into the bathroom off my bedroom and hide. This is kind of like the V house in A City, but not. I quickly go pee and then try to hide under a pile of bed clothes under a small table. The door of the bathroom is a curtain that draws over the door space. I can kind of see through it, although it is not transparent. Margaret comes and sees me but doesn't tell. Later two girl children come by and I hope they don't see me. I'm hidden, but sort of in plain view also. The sister-in-law comes by and peeks around. Margaret lays my play scripts on the pile of bed clothes I am under and asks the sister if it's alright if I rewrite them, if I am found. The sister-in-law agrees, because, of course, it would mean more money for them. (208 words)

I write a play or story and then I experiment with a machine. I am in a small room. Some people come by and take the machine and are looking it over and exclaiming about how I've managed to improve it. I choose to hide beside a young woman in a wheelchair. I look up at her, asking her not to expose me. I say, "I won't let them hurt you." She hides me. I like being there to eavesdrop on their compliments. Then I rush away and they chase me. I go into the room just beside the one I was in originally and slam the door and try to hold it locked. They pound on the door. They start to come over the transom and I shoot them with my laser beam gun. It slows them down. (139 words)

I am a young boy and am homeless. I look for a place to hide where I can be warm. I go down to the basement of a large house. I look into barrels for a place to sleep. I see a big furnace, so we'll be warm (another boy is with me). Someone is after us. Then we have to go back upstairs. I get in a pickup truck to drive and my partner is now a tiny girl on a tricycle (like a disability). I reach way down to give her a piece of paper she will need, like a deposit slip from a checkbook. She gives it back and I search the list of numbers to see if it's the right ones. She says, "Can we arrange to be away from here for two hours, because I don't want to be here when the big cloud comes?" I look over and see a devil's tower, like a volcano, and realize a poisonous or nuclear cloud will envelop this for two hours very soon. I agree and we struggle to get away from there. (186 words)

I am in a library and some new books have been made. Someone videotaped some new material and now some women and myself are going through the material and critiquing it and cataloguing it. I ask a few questions about the abbreviations we will use in our descriptions. Later, I look up on a ceiling and see the underside of a table saw has cut through from above. A man is concerned and wonders why or how this happened. I crawl up and through a trap door to the next floor and see that a woman had started it up and then left it unattended and it cut through. I decide, after debating, to turn it off. Next to it is a sewing machine. I leave it on. Later, Aunt Elaine is asking if I have any more of that apple jam without sugar. I say, "My mother may have some more," and we look in cupboards. We find a jar half full. Later, I am picking at my left big toe nail, trying to get it down to the right size. I go too far and make it too short. It's soft and easy to manage. (197 words)

I am seated in a big fancy wheelchair right in the first row in the center so that I am right up next to the stage. I wonder if I am blocking the view of others sitting behind me. I am aware that I've never seen a show from this perspective before because in high school I always sat in the back, because of my fears. I watch some show on stage and afterward am mingling with the crowd. Two tall men stand by me and I am aware that I am seeing from a new perspective. Men get to see things that short women can't. He laughs and says, "You mean you've never seen black straps and wrinkles before?" (meaning from their tall vantage point they can look down women's dresses. I think with some concern, "Why would I want to do that? I'm not a lesbian, after all." My father sits in the back row and I go to him. I help him carry two huge axes. We go to the parking lot and see his vehicle which isn't working. I place the two axes in what I thought was the vehicle, and now have to retrieve them because they are laying on the dirt ground. I reach in where the truck should be and get them up. It is hard to do. He watches. Then we walk over to the trailer he had pulled. It is an odd hand-made wooden house trailer with an open wall on one side. I get in. It has a long wooden bench on the long wall. My mother is seated there. (270 words)

I am working as a writer in a movie studio in Hollywood. I watch with great interest at everything around me. A good-looking man watches me. He follows me out as I am talking to another man. I am telling him all my many projects and this is overheard by the good-looking man. He is impressed. After we are in the parking lot, I discover there's fences and I can't get out the way I'm going, so I turn to go back. I see a huge wind whipping up the dirt all around. I try to cover my mouth and nose to protect myself. The man gets into a car, takes my pink wheelchair and puts it into the trunk, which is in the front and drives off. We go up a very steep off-ramp with red lights on it indicating we are going the wrong way. I am afraid we'll tip over. He smiles when I ask, "Why are we going this way?" I don't like it. Now we are on the freeway. He suddenly stops on the side of the road and grabs me. He is going to rape and kill me, like a serial killer. I smash his head three or four times against the back window and he slumps unconscious. I push him out of the car, but then decide to get my chair out and leave the car; otherwise I'd be stealing it. I have trouble putting the chair together, but manage and go up the side of the freeway, hoping he doesn't regain consciousness and come after me. I find a phone booth and call for help. (273 words)

I and a man are sexually interested in each other. It's teasing and exciting. He and I kiss and walk and talk. We or I have a hamburger diner that I sort of live in. We walk past two others that are so tiny I wonder how anyone can do any work there and actually make hamburgers. I see rows of catsup bottles on a shelf and a hamburger ready to be cooked. It has a tiny order window. We walk on. We lay on the grass and I draw something on the grass. It's words. It starts with the word "sex" and to the left is another word and on a curve is another word, and a line he wrote crosses my line and makes it hard to read. He tries to read it and says, "I know it starts here," and points to the word "sex." Two other men are nearby and my man gets possessive and jealous and says to them, "She's mine, you understand?" I say indignantly, "Hey, let's get this straight. Yes, I'm with him, make that clear, but I decide when I walk and when I work!" He's embarrassed that I am such an untamable woman, but what can he do? He loves me. We go into the house/diner to find a room to be alone together to consummate our passion. Now I am walking down a hall at an institution where mentally retarded people live. A woman aid says, "It's so amazing. We have to coerce them to get to their writing, but when they finally get interested, there is no stopping them." It's something to watch. They get intensely involved observing things to write about. She describes how one mentally retarded woman went to a window and said, "This is a man, and here is his head and his hands and here is his dick" (the metal handle used to open the window), and then the aid demonstrates how the woman takes the handle into her like it's a dick and has orgasm. I am a bit shocked but, hey, this is life. The life force can not be denied. There is something about aids helping disabled people to have orgasm. (369 words)

I am trapped in a world where I can't find my way out and back to my own universe. Charla and I are walking down a long series of halls, endless. We go faster and faster. I worry I will step in the open holes in the metal floor and fall or hurt myself. I finally see a light coming out of a crack in a door in the wall and try to peek in. I am excited because finally I see other people. It's a class of some kind. I pound on the door and then see they are coming out. I step back so they can open the door. They come out and I go in and see a woman seated on a chair. I assume she is the teacher. I speak to her. I tell her I need help because I'm not of this world, and I was all alone, and it is such a relief to find people, and how do I get back? She is very noncommittal and says, quite unsurprised, that she understands because she isn't of this world either. I say, "Really! Then can I get back?" She says, "Come on to my apartment. We'll talk. We walk a few lengths of a hall and enter her apartment. I see one small living room and a tiny kitchen cubicle. There's not much stuff in there. I ask if I can go back and she doesn't answer. She says, "Will you have dinner?" I say, "Sure. I'll help you clean up after." She shrugs. "You can if you want to, but it's not necessary." She takes a pot of pink stuff and throws it on the floor. I watch as it just disappears into the floor and nothing is messed up. I realize this universe does everything for you. If you want to cook or teach or do dishes or anything, you can, but if you don't, the universe does it. I realize it's sort of a small universe which convolutes on itself because everything doesn't really exist. I show Charla. I stand next to the wall and mark it up terribly. Then I wait for a few seconds (3?) and it repairs itself. I say to the wall, "Change your color - red, black, yellow. It changes to each color. I tell it to go back to the original color. I realize this is very bad, in the long run. What will these people do with their time? There is no challenge. I see the teacher is bored and unanimated. (427 words)

I watch as a woman captain of a riverboat sternwheeler is navigating in shallow water with dead tree stumps and fallen logs all about. I wonder she isn't ripping out the underbelly of her craft with this plowing-through attitude she's got. Finally she sees the center channel, which is the Mississippi River, and deep and large. She goes there and it's clear sailing for a while. Then there is a decision point. On the left is a huge inland lake and to the right, over a sand bar, is more river. She is very impressed with this lake. It is exciting, so huge, the largest lake bounded by a continent. It seems too much for her and she decides to go on down the river, but then now the boat is being driven down a sand dune to the ocean, where an edge of the lake connects. I realize with delight she could not resist the lake and is going for it in a round about way. Now we're on the ocean and I can feel her (the ocean's) powerful waves. (181 words)

A man is stealing things and I hesitate and then join him. It's kind of fun. I grab a pack of Salem cigarettes and some chocolate candy and some money. After a while of being concerned he will get caught, I get "caught up" in the excitement and blatantly steal things, even when shoppers are nearby. The man cautions me and says, "You could get caught." I disregard him like I'm addicted to this and then the police come and I run and hide. I go down a steel ladder into an underground manhole-like place and then I am trapped. They have me. I give up. (106 words)

A play is starting. It's for kids, like the Wizard of Oz or something. It opens with a witch crossing the sky. I look up, we are outside in a city, and I see a man on a helicopter thing. I say, "This time the witch is a man." He has a blue stocking hat on that is pointy like a witch's hat. He's having some trouble landing the thing and I wonder just what kind of a budget this play has where they can afford expensive jet helicopters as props. Two guard jet helicopters come by to assist him. He accidentally gets one of the rotors on a roof and flips over. The play is stopped temporarily, as they go to fix that. I walk down the street. I wonder if the play has started up yet, and see a woman go into a store window display to take her place. I think, "Well, only the best actors get that job, so I guess the play hasn't started yet, but it would be fun to stroll down the street and see all the different live displays." I think Ellie is around somewhere. (193 words)

I live in an apartment and a woman comes in and says, "I have to help you put proper coverings on the tie downs of your curtains." I am surprised and say, "Why?" She says because the management insists that everyone do it. I am upset. "We'll see about this," I say indignantly. She is the secretary of Dan T and his wife. She comes and works for me a couple of hours a week. She takes down the snowman Xmas ornament I have on the right curtain. There is a Santa Claus ornament on the left tie. I walk down to Dan's office and say, "We have to talk." He sighs, "Here she comes, to make trouble again." I say, "Why do I have to put on specific tie down covers? This feels like an invasion of privacy. I should be able to say what I want to have in my own home." He agrees, but he also explains that the ties need to be protected so they won't get dusty. We talk. I go inspect his curtains to see if he is complying with the rule. He has lace curtains that don't have ties. I say, "I'll have the secretary look it over, my curtains, I mean." He seems very grateful that I hire her for a few hours, like this is a very civic thing to do. He then brings me plastic packets with books and yarn craft things in them and I look them over. It has something to do with the curtain stuff. I choose one, wondering if I should pay for it or just walk out with it and assume he gave it to me. I watch him to get a clue if I am being given it or not. I can't really tell. (300 words)

Someone burned my house down (like the M City House) and the insurance is going to pay for building a new one on the same location and I am happy. We are temporarily living down the street in a nice house, but it will be good to get back to the original location. Then I am concerned that the man who burned the house down will do something stupid and get caught, and they won't pay for a new house. Now I am getting into a submarine. As we go under the water, a sailor says, "Ah, I love being under the water. It's so safe and clean." I shudder, because I can't help but worry about what would happen if the sub sprung a leak or broke. We'd be killed by the tons of water, with no oxygen. We go to the bottom of the ocean. Now I am married to a man and he is having sex with another woman right in front of me, and I am hurt and angry, but I still love him. (178 words)

I am in a small, square house and I look out the window to the right and see a small indent in the dirt and realize an eruption is beginning. I watch as I see water squirt up, and then hot steam and lots of water like a geyser. I watch as the hillside, which is completely barren, just dirt, is awash with water. Then I realize this could be dangerous. I still don't move, until it is absolutely obvious; I slide on the water out of the house and down a big hill. I step over books, and land in another small house that is completely surrounded by water, the great flood. The entire world is flooded except my little spot. The water finally recedes and I see some men coming toward me and I must protect myself. I have a whip and I am very good with it. I lash out at them and drive them away, except there are a lot of them and they keep threatening me. One sends a long-horned cow at me. I am about to be impaled on a fence and I reach out and grab the cows horns with one hand and force it to stop. I hold it there and insist it let me ride it. It sort of rolls its eyes at me as if to say, "My God, not that! How embarrassing." But I get on its back and ride away on it. (244 words)

I am pregnant and going into the hospital to have the baby. The dream sort of keeps repeating itself and I repeat going into the room and having a big belly. It seems to take forever and I get bored and tired of the repetition. It doesn't seem to end. (50 words)

I play the violin. I have two of them. One of my violins was the old one that I used when I was in the 4th grade. It used to be my mother's. The other violin is a serviceable one that I use. I play fairly well. I hope my fingers can manage the notes so I won't embarrass myself. Jock is around. He has unpacked a huge bass fiddle. I wonder how we'll fit it in the car. I put the violins on the back seat, without their cases. I hope they don't slide around and get broken. A man comes up to me. He is interested in me. He is married and has children and doesn't seem to want to divorce them, and at the same time he wants to have an affair with me. He is a bit plump and bearded. He reminds me of Pat Brown. He hugs me and kisses me. I let him without really feeling reciprocal feelings. I tell him that I don't want to have a sexual affair with him as he is married. I am also not that interested in him.

I am in a large room, sort of like a gym with furniture. Merle and I are exercising. I am standing and doing stretches. One leg up and then the other and stretching every part of me. It felt wonderful. I tease Merle and tickle him on his round tummy. Now we are moving furniture, a yellow couch. Ginny helps. I pin some yellow sheets of paper up on a side wall of a stage area that is not accessible to wheelchairs. I walk, so it's no problem for me. Someone takes them down and I say, "Hey, put them back! I put them there so people can write on them. I am expecting lots of school kids to come." He says, "But it seems there are better places for this." I say, "I looked. This is the best place." Then I look around again and realize that the main gym wall is accessible and all I would have to do is move the kid's pictures displayed there up here on the side stage wall and use that space. I go to the man and say, "You were right. There is a better place." I go down to do that. I see a huge map of the world on the wall, and later I see it's gone. Now the kids are arriving. I see someone has taken something of mine and I complain, but what shall I do about the pain? I look and I see two Alka Seltzer pills and a small pill. I tell Ginny that these are mine, for the pain. Ginny is busting two kid girls for having drugs. She is lecturing them. [BL] (277 words)

I move into a house and I'm looking it over. I am in the kitchen. I see I have two tables there and wonder if I should move the yellow one out, even though it matches the stove in color. I go around to the back of it and see lots of drawers. I open them and see the previous owner has left stuff. I look through it, hoping I'll find something I like and can use. I see potato peelers and I open one drawer and see it is a mini stove, a sort of built in hot plate thing. I think that's neat. I see tiny coke bottles and gather them up to throw them out. I think they are cute. I decide to keep this table. I pick up cards off the other table that were laid out all in a row. I open a door and see it goes to more rooms, an old room with bits of leftover furniture stored, chairs, etc. I open another door and see a flight of stairs that go down to a basement and a flight of stairs that goes right back up the other side. I try to look around the corner at the bottom to where the basement room goes to the right, but don't want to go down there. I shut the door hurriedly, kind of scared. I then decide to throw the trash down a flight of stairs to the garbage can. Then I decide to go down there and look around. I see I own a motorcycle. I go down and practice riding it, around and around slowly in a circle on the blacktop of my driveway. A neighbor man watches, interested. I see I have a shop front glass window at the ground level and peek in. Perhaps it was an art store. There are lots of windows that let in light in this house. Now I am ready to go for a morning ride on the motorcycle to take picture. I notice I am near a river. I go down the path. Then I see some tree stumps hanging out near the path, dead logs really, laying down. I stop to take pictures of them. I am very artistically intent. The man follows, watching, pleased with me. I see a bright blotch of golden sunlight diffused with ducks flying up and I swing around and snap pictures. There will be beautiful pictures. I go on, more confident with my driving ability. I get to the small coastal town I now live in. I wander around looking at the shops. (436 words)

I am remembering to be a para in a wheelchair so I'll be able to use the dream experience to help me write the Disney movie. I sit in the chair and feel what it's like to push it with my hands, a sports chair. I am going across a bridge, a long one over a huge river and it is now a boat. And as I move down the sidewalk, it is going up and down in the waves. I hang onto the grid metal grating very hard. Each wave brings me down closer to the water. I back up a bit, and the next wave gets me closer to the water. Finally, I am over my head and under water. I hold my breath. Finally, we reach land. I get off and go find a place to stay. I share a tiny apartment with some other people. There are no bathtub or shower facilities there. I'll have to shower at school. I am annoyed at my roommates. One is a stupid young innocent college age girl who follows around the big, handsome, self-centered young man, who is quite willing to take advantage of her and make love to her and then dump her. I am angry at them both. I go into a tiny bathroom and pee. It is 1 o'clock in the morning and I need sleep because tomorrow is the first day of school. Then I wake up and we immediately head on out, looking for a bus. I see a street, N. 4th. It's a city like Dover. We go to the street. Someone says, "Go to the right, there's a mall." But I look to the left and see a bus station stop. I go in that direction as I hear one of my roommates whine he was hungry and would have wanted to get something to eat while he waited for the bus. I pass a popcorn stand and think, he can eat that. Now I am balancing, walking, on a curb of a skinny sidewalk. I feel kind of proud I can do this balancing act. Nobody particularly notices. I get to the bus stop and see two oddly dressed people miming and holding out brochures. I joke with my roommate out loud, teasing the people. I say, "Oh, look, here are some strange people that want our attention. I'm going to ignore them." They shrug and we pass. Then I realize they are the people with the bus route information and say, "Oh look, they had what I wanted and I walked right by." I go back and get a bus route book off a counter. I see a woman in a wheelchair and she works for the bus. I ask the way to the college. She says, "There's a map over here. I see it but it is really high up for a person in a wheelchair to see well. I notice I have a bunch of file folders I don't need, old booklets of the disability unit at the community college, Xmas craft project instructions, a satin angel ornament. etc. I try to sort them out, and only take the stuff I need for college today. I now have a huge bag of yarn and a half knitted thing on double point needles. The woman says, "Is this yours?" I say, "It wasn't, but I guess I'll take it." Then the woman points out a fat woman in an old manual chair in line for the bus. She says, "Too bad, that one really smells" (hasn't taken a bath for a while). She'll probably take the seat on the bus and I'll have to wait for another one. I look at my watch. It's noon. I still have time, but I am feeling frustrated and concerned and burdened down with all this stuff I'm carrying. I wonder if there is a locker there nearby where I can store some of this until I get back from class. (668 words)

I enter a store, on the second level. I pass through a gauntlet of disability activists picketing the store. I pass through them and notice a balcony rail and go to look over and down at the main floor. It is teeming with people. I've never seen such a crowd. I ask someone what's happening. They say it's a sale. I say, "It must be one heck of a sale to get people to push and shove and force their way in." They say, "It is." I think, "I'd never get myself in there, so why even try?" Then I realize the sale is happening on this floor too. Maybe I'll find something here, where it's not so crowded. I find a yarn department and see the prices are really good. A knitting needle that costs $1.25 is a $1 off. I think of stocking up. I look for rug yarn kits, for hooked rugs, or needlepoint kits. There's not much left. I wonder if I could get a freezer, if they are on this floor. (176 words)

A woman is slowly taking over my life and I am not really aware of this. She is outside making friends with my neighbors, and I am in the house, just hanging out. I start noticing she is moving in on my life and am annoyed but lethargic. Then I see her with my memory scrapbook and she is looking at it like it's hers. She decides to burn it. She puts it on a fire outside and I struggle to get up and go there to put out the fire. Now I'm angry at her and have finally made a move to defend my stuff (my life). I try to put out the fire and pull the scrapbook out of the flames. It is smoldering, but most of it is still intact. Now the woman is diabolical, crazed and taking over huge chunks of my life. I don't know if I can stop her, because I waited so long. I let her do it until there was hardly anything left I could own or control. I am back in the house, still fighting a lethargic mood. She's got nearly everything now and I see she's about to leave me in the house, alone with a crazed, evil man. I finally fight. "No," I say, "not that." I rush to the door to try and get out.

A nice man, large, like my cousin Lenny, is the president of a political club. He invites me to come to the meeting. He's explaining the facts to me. There are two women and two men who are going to vote on this issue. They are against the nice man's ideas. As we are discussing the ideas, and the man is writing on a blackboard, he makes some reference to Arkansas. The woman says, "I wish people wouldn't do that. I'm an Arkan, and I'm not stupid." She has long, braided hair and a long dress, sort of pioneer woman/hippie style. The two men are trying to convince everyone about their side of the issue. I suddenly say, "Let's vote now." The man agrees and we surprisingly win. Only the two men vote against us. Well, that was easy! So the man invites me into the next room for the dinner he had prepared as refreshments for the group. I say, "Maybe I'll take a look," but most stuff has sugar in it. I see eggs, fried, corn meal breads, biscuits, and so on. I compliment the man on his cooking skills. He is pleased. A woman on my right says something about marriage. I say I was already married once. I go sit down and my mother is there. She says, "This reminds me of when I was young and I inherited $1400. My father says, "You mean in stained glass." She says, "No, in money." (247 words)

I decide to take a nap in a pickup truck cab, with the door open. I am on the passenger side and laying on my tummy, facing the back of the cab, my left leg hanging out the open door. Some woman is with me. I look up and see that we are moving and I recognize we are in M City. Somehow while I was napping, we drove to M City. I sit up, now in the driver's seat and try to hit the brakes; they do not respond well. I steer us into a left turn, as if toward the M City house. I get out. I see Aunt Elaine and Suzanne as a child. I don't want to greet Aunt Elaine at first, but she sees me and invites me into her apartment. I go in and look around. It looks nice. I notice the padded upholstery walls and say, "My mother told me about that." I quip, "Just right for the mad house. You can bounce off the walls." She shows me the kitchen. I ask how Uncle Lionel is. I see him coming in. She says, "He's not doing well." I look. His cancer is getting very bad. She is fixing his medicine in the kitchen, saying she wished she could give him a really big dose so he would die. This was a loving and humane thought. She goes out to the living room and I pick up the plastic dose cup which is quite large and taste the medicine, which is the color and consistency of honey. I realize I'm tasting lethal stuff and spit it out, spitting many times to get it out of my mouth. I hope I didn't take in enough to kill me or make me ill. I go into the living room. (304 words)

I am in a wheelchair and going down a sidewalk. There is a man in a wheelchair that is like the deli man, mentally retarded and nonverbal. He wants to talk to me. I stop and listen while he sort of mumbles or something and I somehow figure out what he's saying. He's asking me where I'm going and what I do. I say I'm a teacher, which intimidates him. I go on, leaving him behind, knowing he would like to connect with me, but I sure don't want to connect with him. I am going to catch a bus. I get to the bus. It is tall and forbidding. The doors are closed. I rap on the door and say, "Lift" or "wheelchair." He finally opens the door. A strange stretcher-like thing comes out and we zip up; I am positioned and he starts driving. I think, "Hey, I'm not tied down," and then realize this is a very modern and wonderful bus. I am tied down automatically. I look out the window and am amazed at the very modern high tech things I see, monorail trails, and realize I'm on one too. We curve this way and that and once I notice I can see ahead where there are no rails, but we are going that way and I wonder how we can do that. I must be in the future. Big red sleek trains pass us. This is the way of the future. I have my yellow writing desk pad on my lap and a telephone. Some man sits to my left. I ignore him as I continue with my business. Then I want to put my things away, I put them in a cubby hole locker thing on the wall to my right. I stuff them in. I now have two small blue fanny packs and they both have lots of money in them and I put them in, noticing the man is watching. I hope he isn't going to steal the money when I nap. I zip up the compartment. It has two zippers, one on each side. Then the man wants to talk to me and I grab him by the throat and say, "Leave me alone." This really scares him and he gets up and goes to sit in the lap of the train driver like a scared little boy as I or a sort of narrator says, "Naw, he's not scared." It's funny. Then a little girl sits next to me, on my left. She wants my attention. Then I see a sort of scene where the daddy comes home and the child is delighted to have him there because it's someone else to play with and relate to. It was getting old just having the mommy around. She got grumpy. He's in the bathroom, taking off his pants, presumably to take a bath or get ready for bed. Now I have the little girl who wants to curl up on my lap and I try to ignore her. Then I realize she feels sad and neglected. I take her in my lap, remembering how it felt to hold my girls when they were little, like 2 or 3 years old. I pat her on the butt and leg gently as a way to comfort her. I look out the window and see a blue woodpecker or blue jay in a pond of water and other pretty sights of wilderness (a tamed city kind of wilderness). (584 words)

I see my little boy baby, he's maybe a 1 and a half years old. He's been playing with some people. He comes over to me and crawls into my arms. I hold him and hug him. My daughter Paulina is there also, and she is a young girl. It feels good to have them there with me. He needs lots of attention and loving. Then I am in a passenger side of a car and Paulina and her husband Lance are in the back. We're going to the coast for a vacation. Suddenly Lance is washing my hair. I am startled and say, "You'll get my clothes wet." Then I remember I had forgotten to pack my clothes and pills. I was so busy attending to the children I forgot to pack for myself. I am a bit embarrassed. I don't want Lance and Paulina to be embarrassed and concerned that they will be traveling with a person in a suit of sweats that are wet from the hair washing. I get the feeling that Lance washed my hair to sort of force me gently into changing my sloppy attire so they won't be embarrassed by my appearance. I assure them I can stop off at a store and buy a couple of outfits. "We can go to Goodwill," I say, thinking of saving money. I remember I can go to a pharmacist and get a few pills to tide me over.

I am in a small boat in the huge ocean and we are in trouble. I think Howard is with me. We are on a boat lane and larger things go by, nearly swamping us. They are so big they don't see us waving or hear us yelling for help. A boat goes by towing like a water skier, a car. I think that is strange. Now I am dumped out of our boat and am struggling to stay afloat. I am in front of a boat and I wave. Finally they see us and rescue us. Now the boat is a truck and my office supplies are in it, including my manila envelopes I send scripts in. Someone, a female, perhaps Millie, is moving the things into the house. I reluctantly agree they should be there, but I don't want them to clutter up the place. Now we have to move where I keep my things. I have an ironing board with cubby holes under it where I am putting some of the envelopes. Another library table is against the wall. I pace. Howard is in the house. I open the window and look out. I lean out. I want out. I take in the fresh air. Now I go to the other end of the room and lean out another window. It is a full floor up from another room in the house. Nothing is in the room. I realize as I'm leaning that I am laying on a sliding drawer that is going full out and suddenly it slides right out and the drawer and I are falling the full floor down. I hope I won't get hurt. I land and it is painful but I am OK. I am shocked I did that. I realize it was partially suicide. Howard comes into the room and I tell him what just happened. He does not even acknowledge he heard. He turns and walks back into the room he was in. I follow him, screaming, "I hate that. I hate it when you don't respond!" He ignores me. I go back upstairs to my room and notice the drawer is gone on that window so I can't do it again. I pace, upset. Howard is moving me out. (380 words)

I have two students and I tell them to get ready for the party. I go to my bedroom and go to my closet to choose a very sexy dress, because I intend to seduce the male student. I open the right side door and see many fancy dresses, prom dresses, nice looking suits etc. I choose a two-piece suit with a very low cut blouse. I put it on and it is very tight and forces my boobs up. I feel fully packed and firm. White suit, red blouse. I go out to the living room. I have a sort of wimpy, but nice, husband. I go to the front door to greet the guests. They are all high-powered lawyer type men. They come in. I flirt strongly with one of them. An older man doesn't think I'm a good wife. He comments. I walk purposefully across the room, grab him by his suit lapels and stick my face in his. I say very firmly, if not menacingly, "I have a Ph.D., I have an IQ of ___ (very high), I'm a damn good lawyer and so why shouldn't I be what I am. My husband understands this and gets out of my way" (meaning it is a good balanced relationship). Even so, I still deliberately go after this other man with the intent of having sex with him. We dive into a swim pool, fully dressed in our party clothes. He and I are in a far corner talking and he starts to get pushy and rough. I realize I'm in "over my head" and have made a wrong decision. My husband is truly a nice man and why am I messing with this other guy? I swim away from him to return to my husband. (298 words)

I am seated in a row boat which is on its boat trailer on land. Howard is there. Dovre is too. Dovre takes my crutches and goes around deliberately falling down in front of people so they will rush to her thinking she is a crippled girl and pick her up. I am embarrassed that she would do this. I watch her do it; she's in a dress and she falls. The people rush over, all in sympathy. Dovre is grinning and playing it up. I shrug and think, "Well, if that's what she wants to do, but I'd never do that. I can't believe she would do it." Then suddenly the boat starts rolling down the steep hill. I hang on and say to Howard, "What's happening?" He says, "I don't know." He peeks over the edge of the boat and looks at the wheels. I say, "This thing is running away. This could be dangerous." He starts to get out to pull it to a stop. I lean this way and that to give it direction, to steer it. I do it well and he pulls it and I turn it so that it must go uphill, which finally brings it to a stop. I say to Howard, "I did that. Didn't I do that well? I think I did that well." He says, "Oh yeah, that was OK." I really want him to compliment me. He's his usual noncommittal self. Now we start pushing it back up the hill. I am still in it and I ask him if he wants me to get out so it won't be so heavy to push. As he is deciding if he wants me to get out, another woman gets in, expecting a ride up the hill. I say, "Hey, we have to get out. I'm getting out too." She says, "Well, if you're getting out, then I suppose so." She is reluctant to move. I get out and now I am climbing up a narrow shaft of stairs. I know this is hard to do and I am thankful the shaft is so narrow that I can lean my back against the wall of one side as I walk up the stairs, or I would fall, it is so steep. I place one hand on the next step up and pull myself up one step at a time. Finally I find the top. I can't pull myself up the last step and I call out for help. "Help, help," I call. People laugh and refuse to help me. "I have trouble walking," I say. They sneer. I finally manage to pull myself up and I stand, brushing away the dust on my knees. I see an open room, a sort of classroom where people are seated and I say to them, "That's one more karma for you." They sneer and laugh at me. I walk on, trying to get back to where we'd started. I see a poster on the ground. It says Andrea and Mel Torme. I think I'm in a Mexican village. (515 words)

Ellie and I are using someone's apartment to receive important mail, but without their permission. Ellie hired a taxi driver to park and wait for us, then she put on a fake gray beard, a long one, and went up to get the mail (like Social Security checks or something). She comes out and she pays the taxi driver who held the parking spot for her. The next time, we go up together. We are in the apartment when unexpectedly the family returns. We are embarrassed and worried and try to leave as quickly as we can. They don't seem to care or notice anything is unusual about strangers being in their apartment. We leave quickly before they figure it out. I go to an elevator, and Ellie says they are only displays. They don't really work. They are like snack vending machines. Now we have to go down the stairs and there are 66 flights of stairs. We start going down. It's a long and difficult walk. (168 words)

I am standing on the stage and playing a trumpet. I have an unusual style of playing the low notes that makes my playing unique. It just happens to be the way I can play, but people love it. I play a song called Love is a ____, some sort of sad thing, as an encore. I love the sounds of the warm applause and bask in it, knowing it's a form of love and there is no one for me after the show, but somehow that's OK. There is a talk with audience members after the show in the downstairs Studio One room. (104 words)

Some cousins and I go down a hall to see a small cubicle at the end of the hall where my parents have moved some of their things to store. They have put up pictures on the wall and knick knacks and it's like a tiny, crowded living room. Their regular living quarters are a long way back down this hall. I guess they needed extra storage space. I look at the pictures. I see one and pick it up off the sort of "plate holder" contraption holding it up. I then see the holder is a series of figurines my mother had made years ago. One is the wicked witch of the west, out of clay like her little pilgrims she made. I see it is her face on the little figure. I laugh. I show it to my cousins. My father is there. I ask when was it we went to Disneyland. She says the first time was years ago, I'd just had one of the babies and I wanted to go, but I was in a lot of pain and they didn't want to release me from the hospital. I said, "Really? I thought we only went once when I was in high school." She says, "No, after the babies, we went." I say, "After the girls, huh?" Then I remember there was me and then two boys and then Lydia. I say, "What did you do?" She says I told her (the nurse) I always fight for who I am. My father said, in response to my repeated question, what did you do? that "She nursed her," meaning the nurse nursed her to ease the pain (meaning somehow removing milk from breasts). Now I go into a tiny room next to this tiny room, which is Dovre's bedroom. I am looking at the shelves of boxing gloves and things like that she has. She's in the armed services. Three men from her unit come in. One is a black man. He says to her -- my back is to him as I'm looking at all this sports equipment -- he says, "I'd like to talk to you, Fever, alone, in private." I say, "Well, then I'd best give you some space to be private, FEVER." They step out of the room, expecting Dovre to follow. I say, "No, I'll step out, it's your room after all." I go out. I tell my parents of the incident, only this time my mother is white and my father is black. Or maybe they are Dovre's parents. They look worried like maybe she'll choose a black husband, because that's what she had as a father (Dovre looked completely white.) Now we've moved on somewhere, and are walking. A woman is standing by the path, gesturing to us to look. Dovre says in awe, "She's dripping in gold." She has a number of gold chain necklaces on she is trying to sell. This completely fascinated Dovre. I feel her being drawn away to this. I am worried. Now it's sort of cowboy days. The black men come back and harass us. He says, "Go ahead, hit me." I say, "No, I won't because that's what you expect." Now he's grabbed me and holding me close to him belligerently. My knee is right up against his balls. He says, "Go ahead, kick me in the balls." I'm tempted but say, "No, that's what you expect." I then push him down on the ground somehow and say, "But I will eat your face off," and begin to bite him ferociously. This surprises him and it hurts him and (I think I got him down by stepping on his foot hard with stiletto heels). Now he's not protecting his balls so I knee him there. Just as I thought, he had a plastic protector on. He laughs and says, "See, no balls." I say, "I knew that." (654 words)

I am rehearsing a play and asking the dancer, actors to do a bit where they line up against the wall and dance. They do it, but I see they are invisible through the entire dance until the last musical riff, and then I see sparkly lights where their feet are, and then I see them materialize. I do this several times, really mystified as to why I can't see them. Then I realize, "Oh, black light." I then run and look up on the ceiling and see a small light fixture and know that's where the black light is coming from. I say pointedly to the people in the production booth up by the ceiling, which I cannot see, "Hey, wiggle the light up and down." They don't. Now I go stomping across the floor, I gather up papers and head for the boss's office. I snag a woman actress, I yell up at the producers, "Get down here now, we're having a meeting. I'm going to blow the whistle." We get to the boss's office. I hear him in there talking to someone. A young man comes in and I say, "The other one too." He goes back out the door to get him. I glower at the young woman. The man returns with another young man and I say, "OK, him too, but I really meant Merle." "Really?" says the guy, surprised, "I thought sure you'd want Bob, what with our outrageous ways of producing." I say, "Get Merle. Merle. (Rob Reiner) comes in. He says, "What's up?" I lean into him as he sits on a table top and say ominously, "Someone's going to be out of a job." He assumes it's him and gets up saying, "Might as well take a walk." He leaves. I realize then he misunderstood and thought I was accusing him. I hope he comes back. The boss comes out and I say to him, "I want a few minutes of your time, it is important, very important, underline important!" He agrees and says, "Just a minute." He leaves, I assume to the bathroom. I realize I need to pee and lay my papers down and say, "I'll be right back." I go out to the hall and see a door to the right. It has a long metal stick for easy wheelchair access on the door. The word Jail is printed on the door. I wonder what that means. I go in to pee and then I wake up, thinking, "Might as well not bother, I need a real toilet." (430 words)

Lucy Ball and Desi Arnez are very, very old and she is wrinkled. I see a closeup of her face. She has heavy oldness makeup on. Her nose is like the gnarled, twisted juniper tree trunk in shape. Her eyes are very human and sad as they peer through the makeup. Then I see a second pair of eyes, small and close set under that sad pair. I wonder which pair is really her. The gist of the feelings is that they really still love each other and are trying to get back together. (94 words)

Valerie is very pregnant and we are talking. I am stirring something I am cooking for the little girl. It is boiling and frothy. I decide to pour in some cold water and when I do, the level of the froth sinks and it is now just a small amount of stuff (like oatmeal) on the bottom of the pan. Valerie is now very upset with me. She says this will cause her to lose the baby. She thinks I did this to make her lose the baby, the metaphor being her belly all big and round then becoming flat and empty like the concoction in the pan. I am sad and cry; I beg her to believe me. I didn't do it to harm her baby. I was trying to make this good thing to eat and it just worked out that way. I put my hands on her arms to reassure her. She pulls away from me angrily. I cry and cry. I follow her, begging her to believe me. (172 words)

I am in an elevator and can't seem to make the thing go where I want it to go. I push a button and we go up or down but I never seem to get to the bottom floor which is where I'm headed. The floor of the elevator is a metal plate that on one floor is securely bolted down and on another floor slides over to another part of the elevator. I get out and ask directions. I go back in and finally get it down to where I need to go. A man comes in. I ask him where the hydrodrone, no the hydro, the water therapy is. He says, "Right down the hall." I say, "Do I turn to the left?" He says yes. He walks with me. I see a young girl throwing a temper tantrum. I know she won't get what she's after because she's being so dramatic about it. Then I lay down on the floor and sob and sob. I feel very sad. He lays down to comfort me. I am in a sexy black outfit with garters and lace and am in a fetal position, butt in air. The man is obviously attracted to me and that is why he consoles me. I wonder if I won't get what I need because I'm making such an emotionally big deal of it. He assures me this is different. I really am feeling the feelings and therefore it's OK to express them. (249 words)

I am in a large meeting room. The dream group is there and we are sort of reading a handout about dream work. I find it very interesting. I am on a bench. We are all seated on this bench against the wall. I am on the left end. Tony comes over and squats next to me on the left side. We talk. He is saying something about a woman he likes or is considering for relationship, but there are some things she's going to have to learn if it's going to work out. He hopes she learns it because he is lonely and would like to have a relationship. I commiserate with him. I let him put his hand on my arm and am aware that I feel fairly relaxed about this close contact. I feel empathy for him as I would like a relationship also. I make a comment that I've had some dreams that are pertinent to the material we are reading and would like some help working them. The group calls on the writer of the material to come and work with us and my dreams specifically. He comes. It is Jeremy. He sits on the bench several people to my right and I realize that he has made a special trip over just to work on my material just because I requested it. I feel some guilt around that, taking up all the attention and the time. He and the group seem just fine with it. It is my problem that I am feeling guilt. So I stand to start telling some of the dream material. I turn to face the people on the bench and see at the far right end (now the left as I am facing it) a double door, open to the church area. I see a huge black spider on the door and feel queasy. I look in and see an identical spider on the yellow sign on the curtain behind the altar. This seems scary, perhaps that means there are more and closer to me. I look around and see a third one in the room with me. I see a large set of holes in the stone or cement wall at the base of the wall where they can come in. (383 words)

A silly-looking man and the ditsy Corkie from Murphy Brown are in a car. He's driving. Suddenly the car is going backward and he is startled. Then it goes forward again. They come to a stop and get out. She says to him, "Why don't you go wash the bottom of that window for the owner of this gas station/store?" It's a huge plate glass window. He grumbles and says, "No way," but he does it. He has a huge window mop and sprays water on the window and washes it. I see the black dirt rinsing off and it is squeaky clean. Then she is talking about how amazing the dream was. She says, "Why don't you do it?" (meaning work it). He doesn't want to, it's too awesome. He does and then she says it's her turn to work it. She is going to put her foot in his hand and he will lift her up. This is working it. She says, "OK, but where will I hold on? Oh," she says, "by the roots of your hair," and delicately grabs the hair at the base of his neck. He says, "Not the roots!" because that would be painful. "OK," she says. She holds her foot up, it's tiny and in a spiked heel shoe. He's standing awkwardly and this is embarrassing for them to do because it's such an intimate stance. As she is leaning forward to get balance, she accidentally kisses him on the lips. She says, "OH! I never meant to do that. This is so embarrassing. I should have known better than to work a dream. What will my husband think?" She then turns and walks away from him. Now I am watching as a stream of men and women come into the house and walk back to the back bedroom. They are all dream workers and can't wait to get started working the dreams. Their family members are hanging out in the living room, several laying on the couch. One man groans and says it's his brother going in there, it's so boring and weird. They are always so thrilled and excited when they are talking about what this means and that means in the dreams, like who cares! I am so amazed because I am a dreamer and want to go to the back room, but it so fascinating hearing the perspective of the significant others to the dream work -- I'd never seen this perspective before -- that I want to hang out and listen in. Ellie comes out of the room carrying bags of her stuff with her. She'd been driven out of her own bedroom because of their enthusiasm. (450 words)

I am in a room with something, a monster or something, and the door opens and some people leave and I decide to leave too. I dash for the door and it is shutting. I struggle to force it open as I squeeze through, nearly getting it shut on my leg. I am aware I am leaving the room too soon. I should stay and work it out with the monster and then the door would be easy to open, but I leave anyway. Now I walk down a long hall which is sloped down. There are very tall people at the end of the hall. I go down there. It is supposedly my bedroom. I go in, looking with interest at the paper clippings pasted on the door. I go in. There are ugly-looking girl/monsters in there. I don't like that much -- blue hair, ugly faces. I leave this room and walk down the hall. A strange old man follows me. I don't want him around. I pass a hall that branches off to the left. I say, "You go there," meaning it's more appropriate for ugly monsters to go there. I look down the hall and shudder. I'm glad I'm not going down there. I walk straight ahead to the good room. Hasani greets me. She's going to work with me, like a counselor or masseuse. I'm glad I finally got here. We go in. I lay down on a couch/bed on top of a man. He's a stranger, there for the same reason I am. (259 words)

I am in a bedroom, kind of like Grandma Agnes'. I look at my breasts and notice I am wearing two bras, my normal one and a very strange one that makes me look like I'm wearing those armor breastplates Viking opera singers wear. It makes my sweater really stick out. I decide this looks silly and want to take it off. I have some trouble getting it off. Now I'm trying to do the clasp on my regular bra and notice it's been changed and I don't like that. I was used to how easy it clasped before. I am annoyed. Now my father is saying we should go see the old homestead (meaning the new house). The feeling is like we're wasting time playing around here, we need to get on to business. Now I am in a house high in the mountains. I look out the window and see a range of mountains, and see in the distance smog, brown, hanging over the mountains. I say, "But it's not so bad," feeling relieved. Then I look again and see clouds of red radioactive-like stuff floating past. I see one coming near me and over the house I'm in and then it passes, but that was close, and I don't like it. I notice the bottom of the cloud looks white, clean and fluffy, and the top is red and dropping bits of the grudge off into the air. (241 words)

I am on stage, talking with a talk show hostess. I am seated in an armchair. I am parallel with the audience, rather than facing them. As I talk with the hostess, the audience warmly applauds my remarks. I am talking about disability awareness, people not seeing me for who I really am, but responding to the image of disability. As I realize the audience loves me, I turn a bit more toward them. The show is over and I stand and walk to the edge of the stage to take my bow. They are wildly cheering. I have to work hard to get around the posts and curtains to get to the edge of the stage. Even then the audience seems seated far back. There is lots of distance between them and me. I go off stage to the wings. Richard L and his younger brother are there, sort of my managers. One on each side, we walk out, talking about our next gig, and am surprised at the warm response of the audience. (175 words)

I am walking and looking for my hotel. I look ahead and see an underpass bridge of a freeway. It is huge and cement. I suddenly remember there was an earthquake yesterday and maybe it would be dangerous to pass under this huge structure. I hesitate, afraid and not wanting to be stupid and just go, regardless of danger. I watch and see that other people are walking under it and decide it must be OK, then. I walk under it and no problem. I now can't seem to find the hotel I'm going to. I walk around, looking. It should be on this block, on the right. It is yellow. (111 words)

I am camping out with a couple of men and their boys. The other wife didn't come, so I sit alone while the men go out hiking or something. I sit rather bored on a log or something. I lay back and notice the sky. On the left side, it is twilight and an occasional star. On the right side, is a black sky filled with stars. I wonder why that is and look back and forth at the differences. I then see on the right side that part of the difference is there are lots of cloud-like things which is the Milky Way. Now the men come back with the boys and are cutting up a big meat loaf into strips and squares to eat. I say to one of the men that I wish his wife Irene were here so I'd have someone to talk to. Then I look up in the sky again and see ducks, lots of them flying by, big adult ducks and lots of baby ducks. One duck attacks another and bites it. I realize they are very hungry. I want to feed the baby ones and get some bread and crumble it up. Some adult ducks land and eat and then a baby duck comes down and sticks to a wall. I go over to see it and notice it is a piece of cardboard folded in half and I open it to see a purple colored jewel and realize these ducks aren't born yet. This is their embryo in this jewel-like thing and they are still growing and forming. I regret having called them down and try to send them back on their way, hoping I haven't caused them any harm.

I am still in a school and someone says they are holding the masters exam in drumming. Someone mistakes me for a Master's student and says, "Come on, you're next." On a whim, I decide to try it. I wear green and yellow sweats (UO colors) and brush my hair up into a weird male pompadour hairdo. I go in, and up on stage. I bang away on chairs, drums, walls, anything around and the rhythm is quite good. I hope they don't ask me any theory questions; I wouldn't know them. I think about what a 16th note would be like. The audience loves me. They think I'm a guy and they cheer wildly for me. They are far back in the auditorium. I walk down a side ramp or stairs toward the front of the stage. I see the head of a professor, but not his body. I guess the body is behind a wooden door, partition, at the front of the stage. I am a bit arrogant. Later, I wake up and then fall back into this dream. Only this time, we are in the next morning and we have to have our pictures taken. I am wearing a sexy black strapless dress that curls provocatively over my full breasts. I look down and notice my nipples are showing and try to readjust the dress. I head for the bathroom and some woman says, "Don't forget, don't eat or drink anything before the pictures" (like a nurse would say before a test of some kind). I say, "But I can go pee, right?" She agrees. I go in and try to pee, but can't. A woman opens the door and closes it. I get up and go out, headed for the stage area. I want to hurry and get the picture over with so I can change into my drummer suit (male) and play. I again notice my nipples are showing and readjust. I think, "Maybe I should change now. It wouldn't do for my mother to see me dressed like this." I joke, "Maybe I should hold my hands like this," over the breasts to cover them; it looks silly. The woman comedian from the community college is there and saying she just can't do this. She's going to give up and not do a picture. I shrug, a quitter. Oh well, it's her choice. (399 words)

I am in bed, taking a daytime nap, curled on the bottom right corner. The bed is next to a wall with a window. I sense someone coming into the room and laying down on the bed with me. I wonder who it is and then as that person readjusts their position, I roll back into them so that we are now in spoon fashion. I know this person is a woman and wonder if it is Dora or Ellie. I feel a bit uncomfortable about it and then decide to just relax and not worry about it. What will happen will happen. She leans into me and sweetly caresses my hair and kisses me once on top my head like someone would do for a baby or a dear friend. I do not respond, but feel loved. She gets up and leaves. I sit up and look out the window and see a cafe outside and wonder what it serves to eat. It could be fun eating in a place so conveniently near home. I see bears, like Russian circus bears, and call to my daughter to come look. Now I go outside to see the bears. One comes near and rolls over as though it wanted its tummy rubbed. A woman goes over to do that. I warn her to be careful, these are bears and could still be dangerous. She rubs her scruffy, fuzzy, slippered foot on the bear, who rolls back over and growls and starts to bite her foot. She backs off, afraid. I go to distract the bear by making noises. I am aware I do not want to put myself in danger just to save her. A man passes by and pushes the bear and it goes off and away. I notice we are on a beach and the ocean looks inviting. My girls want me to be in the boat with them, and as I am trying to climb up the side of the boat to get in, they speed it up and head for deeper waters. At first it is playful and then more serious. I say over and over, "Please wait until I get in." This could get dangerous. Finally I am in. They are sort of surfing with the boat. We'd go up a wave and surf down the curl. It is scary and I don't want to do it, but as it repeats, I start to get used to it and enjoy it. Then I see we're still in the bay or protected water. I look over and see the real ocean, dirty with oil drilling crews and huge, hard waves. The girls want to boat in it and I decline, saying, "They are working here. We'd only get in the way." So we go on down the shoreline and then the water gets deeper and a wave comes up to my waist. I am clothed and all wet. I look behind me and see it's big waves coming. I look ahead, on down the shoreline, and see we're being funneled into a slooshing thing which could get dangerous very fast. I try to find handholds on the now high bank we are near. I wonder when the open beach became this wall of dirt and tree roots. I find a way up and call out to them. They announce they also found ways up. I crawl up, ripping out rotten boards to reveal a roadway up there I could get to. I pull and struggle to get up there because the waterway is getting very scary and dangerous. (601 words)

I am part of a three-person gang that is going to rob something. We all have guns and are walking down a huge field, like a park or football field. Lots of plain clothes cops are around. They have us surrounded (like in Dog Day afternoon movie). One follows behind me, harassing me. I turn and threaten to shoot him, yelling at him like Al Pacino did in the movie, "Don't come any closer, get away." I see men with guns drawn in front of me, backing up as I walk forward. I don't see much hope of getting through this alive. The man behind me has a rope and he tries to coil it around me and I yell at him and get away from him. I then say, "I need to use the bathroom." He suggests I use the one in the room just ahead of me. I peek in and don't see a toilet. I tell him this won't work. I leave the room. My two accomplices are off somewhere doing their part of the robbery. I then go off somewhere and put on a disguise. I am aware of how close the trigger is to being pulled. I worry I'll accidentally pull it and hurt somebody. The trigger is warped or melted in an odd shape. I see one of my accomplices and ask what I'm supposed to be doing. He says, "Get the wire cutters and cut the fence." I say, "Near the van?" He says, "Yes." I go there, realizing the disguise is working. I could just walk out of there, but they catch my two friends, so I give myself up to be with them. I feel a little sad. (287 words)

I am in a house and the little boy is playing with lots of war toys. I decide this is not good and I go into his room and start to destroy the toys (millions of little black plastic soldiers) by stepping on them. That's too much work, so I think them all away. The little boy is upset with me. I know he'll get over it and find more wholesome toys to enjoy later. Now a neighbor lady comes by to visit. Then I go down the hall and into another room. I hear someone calling to me and I look into yet another room. A tiny fuzzy black and yellow caterpillar is talking to me. He says, "I know what I want from you." I say, "What?" He says, "Allocates and a movie." I think that's a great idea. We can give each other allocates and feel good. He says, "Look at this." I look and he causes his furry head top to bush out. I laugh, it's so cute. He does it again. This time I say, "Wait, let me feel it." I reach down and put my hand on his head and wait. He bushes out again and I laugh. It tickles and is soft. Then I go into another room, thinking it's been awhile since we've done anything special together to feel good. Then I hear him saying to another woman, "What I want from you is a good cooked meal." I feel jealous. He didn't ask that from me. Then I know this is fine because he can get what he wants from different people and each can give their best thing, and no one gets overly strained.

I am somewhere in a house and someone, maybe a dad, comes in and asks why aren't I already out there, maybe going swimming. And I say, "Maybe I'm afraid to go out there."

I am in a house and a weird, surreal thing goes on. A man and his wife and their son live there. I am visiting. There are two bedrooms and I open one and see the son in there and I open the next one and the son says, "Look." I look on the bed and I see a shark fin cutting a circle like out of an iceberg. "Shark," I yell. The son peeks in and we see a baby alligator. I say, "I hope he doesn't get out." I look under the bed to see if he's crawling out that way. I leave the room. The wife, sort of Goldie Hawn-like, has her back to me and the husband comes up and playfully tries to kiss me. I am concerned. Did the wife see? This isn't right. I pull away (the dream ego is observing all this). I walk away. Now the man is sort of crazed and he goes into the first bedroom. The wife says, "We have to kill him." She hands me a rifle. She has one. We go into the room. He's in a chair (sort of like Merle's wheelchair and sort of a tank). He has a rifle and raises it to shoot me. I take aim and fire. I blow a hole in the chair and in him about belly or thigh height. He screams in pain. He then aims at me to shoot. I fire again and again. He keeps coming. I wonder if I ever had bullets. I start to run toward the door. He and the son come around to get me and as I make it to the door, I see them coming right at me. The only thing to do is to die. I hope it doesn't hurt too much when he rolls over me. He comes and I go under and I am completely pulverized. The purple gunk that is left over of me flops in the track of the chair/tank. It's kind of gruesome. My consciousness observes all this. The family won. Husband, wife, and son were all in this together. (356 words)

I am talking with someone like Frank from Murphy Brown. I say with regret, "I had the shortest relationship of my life. We met thursday night and by Friday night, it was over, but at least I had some (meaning sex)." They commiserate with me. I look outside to see the other people all grouped together in two large groups. The group on the left is Palestinians, Jews and European whites. The one on the right has disabled people, people of color, etc. I say to the leader of this conference, "I want us to do a circle dance and I want to lead it," because I notice that we are still grouping with people we have some knowledge of and not opening up to people who are different. So I go out to organize it. The leader thinks it's a good idea, but doesn't particularly want me to lead it. Maybe I should just be in it, not lead it. I walk around telling people to connect with others that are very different from them. A Ted Turner kind of man comes up to me and says he prefers fat people. I think, "Yeah, that's considered different too." He goes on. Then he comes back and says, "Are you fat?" I hesitate and say, "Well, overweight, some, yeah." He decides to stay by me in the circle, which makes me a bit nervous. He might like me. I am wearing jeans and walking and look pretty fit and in good shape. (252 words)

It is Halloween and I have lots of costumes and clothes on a rack. A man is looking at them and I go over and flirtatiously go through the clothes as I make my way toward him. He then doesn't seem too interested. A small girl and her mother see a lovely white brocade or satin two-piece suit of mine and hold it up to the girl to see if she wants to wear it for her costume. I feel a bit upset as it's my actual clothes and pretty, and then I see that when it is on the little girl, it is a costume. I then go to a coffee table and pick up some cards to show a small boy. They are Valentine cards and cute. Then as I arrange them, I sing "Oh Holy night" My voice is beautiful and I get confused with the melody of "Oh, Silent Night." I say, "Look at the beautiful stars." I look out the window like it's the M City front window and see a mass of stars with patterns. I realize I'm looking at an ornate design my mother made and put up as decoration.

A woman kneels in front of me. She has a power drill and she is going to drill a hole in my belly button. I get scared it will hurt and she looks up at me like, "What a scaredy cat!" I had seen a demo and knew it didn't hurt anyone, but I still could not relax and believe it wouldn't hurt. (63 words)

I am driving a van or VW bus and decide to park it on the side of the road. It is snowy there and I try different spots. Finally I park it in a deep snow bank and then change my mind. That was a mistake because I'd get stuck. I drive it to a less snowy area near the edge of the road. I get out and start walking. Somewhere in the dream I choose to wear black, sexy clothes with a low cut bodice to show off my pretty breasts. (92 words)

I am mediating between a father and his teen daughter. I'm on her side. She chooses a strange outfit to wear that the father does not approve of. I ask him what his expectations are because he is expecting her to meet his expectations. I say, "What's so wrong with what she's wearing?" He is disgusted with me for not obviously seeing the consequences she will face wearing these clothes. I say, "Well, those are her consequences. She will have to face them." She also plays dumb to get us to do her homework for her. I realize the father and I have slipped into this trap. I say to her, "You will have to do your own work now. If you choose not to, then you live with it." (130 words)

I am in an attic room and this man is coming to harm me. I must hide. There isn't any place to hide, but I see a pile of clothes and newspapers and burrow under them. I think this is pretty obvious and worry he'll find me quickly. He comes in, tall and big and scary. He looks for me. He stands right next to the clothes. I lay there motionless, hoping. Then as he turns his back, I slide even further down until I'm under the floorboards in a tiny layer between two levels of flooring, again in a tiny, confining space, a box, a coffin. He looks out the window, wondering if I had gone out on the roof and decides I wouldn't do that; too scary. He leaves to go look for me downstairs. I go out the window and up on the roof. It is scary and high. I see a neighbor and mouth to them, "Get the fire department," thinking they could rescue me. I worry they'll come too close, not understanding me, and he'll get that I'm on the roof before help arrives. (189 words)

I have sex with a man. It is driving and many orgasms, but there is no sense of sexual pleasure. Even the orgasms are simply painfully sharp waves that force their way through my abdomen. (35 words)

I am in bed next to Merle and we sweetly hold hands and talk like friends. I get up to get ready to go to the beach with Ellie. I'm choosing what to wear. Later I am standing in a bookstore in France, and a man stands near me. I really like him and it is mutual. We are like lovers before we really become lovers, that warm beginning of a love relationship. We look into each others' eyes and smile. He shows me where the small section of books in English are. We are in the political (said in French) section of the store. I say, "I'll be curious to know what they consider political." I laugh at the book I look at. "This is political??" We stroll on down the aisle. He and his business partner are going to buy this place. I look around and say, "We could rent out these spaces and people could build gardens and we could gain from their labor." It all seems fair and equitable. We provide the space and they pay a rent. We go into another room. I ask where the freezer room is. He points it out to me. I look in. It is empty and cold as a freezer room should be. I am pleased. I say, "They can buy a half a beef from us and pay us to cut it and wrap it and freeze it here." I see stairs and we walk up to the second floor. It is only partly done, partitions marked on the floor where the previous owner wanted to build. He's run out of money and declared bankruptcy. That's why we can move in and buy a good bargain so well. Our money and energy will finish the project. I feel a bit sad for him, but maybe he can join with us in some way to be a part of this project. The other man asks, as I am saying I'll do this and that with the space, "Well, what about us? What will we get?" I say, "Anything you want. Name it -- what spaces -- and they are yours." It is a pleasant relationship. (366 words)

I am underground in a rock hallway, tunnel, and suddenly think, "Oh, what if there were an earthquake and I was here. I'd be killed." I start to feel afraid and then I resolutely think, "But there isn't, and let's just hope there won't be." I walk on. I see the stairs and the elevator and choose to walk up the stairs. It is some work, but it is OK. I get to the next floor and look in a door; I am going shopping. The door opens into a huge classroom. I peek in and think, "Well, this isn't the store," and go on down the hall to the next door and look in. The store is there, aisles and aisles of products. I go in to shop. (129 words)

I had sent a book I wrote to the library to be copied and they sent it back. It is a big scrapbook where they cut out each page like newspaper clippings and matted each section with mats that were artistically cut in the shape of human forms lying down and fish. They added little pictures and things that enhanced the story. I am enchanted with it and show it to Ellie. I see she might be bored and I say, "Really it will just take a moment I want you to see this. They did such a great job." I admire and exclaim over each page. A man comes to the door and I am happy to see him. He was responsible for getting me connected to the library and I hug him delightedly. We sort of stumble around a few steps because I am so enthusiastic. I say, "I have to thank you and the library. I'll send them a letter of course, but I want you to see the wonderful job they did." I shuffle through a few pages and can't find at first the examples I'd been looking at. I see one where the prince is standing in confrontation with the spy, or the bad guy. He uses a staff that changes into a snake. It is an obvious confrontation of good and evil. The next picture shows the spy on a cloud, a mushroom cloud up in the sky, and I laugh and say, "Obviously, they all saw Aladdin!" Their spy looks like from the Disney Aladdin movie. I say, "Look at the base of the waterfall," then I look again and say, "No I didn't have a waterfall in my story. It's a mushroom cloud." The pages are in those plastic sheet protector things and in a notebook like my Evangeline stuff. The rings have fallen open and some of the pages are out of sequence and not securely in place. I'll have to fix that later. (333 words)

I am in a wheelchair and decide to go out the front door of this hotel. I open the door and a car is parked right by the door. I ask someone to help me and I get out of my chair and get into the passenger side of the car. The other person then takes the wheels off the chair and folds it and puts it in the car with me. I thank them, shut the door and now transfer over to the driver's side of the car and open that door. I pull out a tool and reach for the parts of the chair to reassemble it. I was using the car as a transition to get to the driveway so I can continue on. I realize I am making a lot of work for myself. There must be an easier way. I start to sew the button on a sweater, which is putting the wheels back on the chair, sort of. One side of the sweater is pink and the other side is blue (like reversible). The button is big, white and thick. This is going to take lots of time and energy. [BL] (196 words)

A man kisses and caresses me and I pull away, experiencing the painful sense of repulsion and knowing there is a deep need underneath all that. I walk away saying, "Don't. No," hoping he doesn't tap into the deep well of sexual feeling and I will lose myself in it and will not be able to resist. (57 words)

I've moved to a new town. I do something with videos. A good-looking man named Claude who is a para wheels up. I am walking. I like him very much. He's younger than I. We keep moving positions in chairs and so on to get closer and closer. I feel so happy with him. We are talking about a video project or something, but we are really just loving being together. He goes down a ramp and I lay down on a bench next to the railing. I say, "We start in the sea and we end in the sea. Or is it...," I wonder which way it goes. Then I decide we start in the sea, come up on land, traverse the hard, high mountains and during the golden years hang out on the high plateau. Then I couldn't figure out why we just didn't stay there until death, but decide we then go back downhill until we are in the sea again. That is life. We hop onto the bench and we are laying together. It is sweet, then he kisses me and I respond and it is a bit tentative like did he really mean to kiss me or are our lips just so close together, but then he hugs me and says he loves me. I say, "I love you too." I am thrilled. I have a beau, someone to be with. I say, "I have an appointment at 4 pm to pick up my van, it's being fixed. Then we can go to the party." He says fine, whatever, just wants to be with me. It is 3:30. I go looking for my address book to get the name, I think it's Frank, and the phone number. I'll call and maybe it's not ready and I won't have to go. I look all over. I go upstairs. It's not there. I can't remember the guy's name. I go to the kitchen after pausing to kiss my man on the way through. I look at several books in a drawer; I see a few pieces of jewelry. A woman friend comes in and I want to tell her of my wonderful happiness and good fortune. I want to think about what sexy wonderful thing to wear for the party to please him. I am starting to get frustrated about not finding the name. I see a list CoLO, the first friend I met in this town, who was also involved with video. It is because of video I met Claude, who reminds me of a young man actor I met. He is soft and sweet and maybe a bit pudgy, but not unattractively so. I love how soft he feels. I can't wait to get to the party and be with him so all my friends can see I have a love. I think to myself, "How painful it would be if he just stopped loving me. How would I bear it?" I fervently hope he doesn't just disappear or fall out of love with me. I am older, after all. Maybe, but then I go into the room where he is, all aglow, and he is still there. I am thrilled.

I enter a classroom. It's a big room and there are only a few students, all young men and a male teacher. I sit near the door and next to the teacher. He drones on. I am annoyed and bored. The men students get real ornery and mutiny. I get up to go to the bathroom. I go in and sit. Someone comes in and tries to push open the stall door. I hold it shut and yell, "Hey, hey." It's one of the men. I wonder if I went in the wrong bathroom, but I guess the men are just rambunctious and without respect. Finally I return to the classroom. A man is in my seat. I go to him and say, "I was here before." He sneers. I get angry and righteous and say, "To hell with you then." The teacher glares at me and says, "ou can't come back in here because you were a part of the men's mischievous disruptions of class." I say to him, "To hell with you. I simply left the room to go to the bathroom at the same time they all left." He said, "You were gone one hour. I say, "I had a little problem, OK??" I am belligerent, and sassy, "and furthermore, you are boring and don't know much. If you want me to stay in the dream interpretation class, you better get good." I go to the table where the men students are seated and it's away across the huge room. A paper comes down for me to sign, the roll call. The men all signed in funny markings to confuse the teacher. I sign my name "Sanders" dead center in blue ink, trying to be legitimate. (289 words)

I and another person, maybe a woman, perhaps Dora, are moving into a new apartment. It is small and empty of all our stuff. The wall is covered with a blue foam pad-like substance to prevent nicks and so on. The woman bumps it and causes a big hole and wrinkles it up. Now the landlords are going to be upset. The woman trowels some putty stuff into the hole and tries to straighten up the wall. I go through the door, which is glass and wood frame, to the kitchen area. We have some glasses and that's about it. I come back to the living room and shut the door, pulling a chain to shut it. Then I look out the window, which is small and a bit high up. I see we are on the shore of a huge body of water. The waves are big and choppy. I see lots of high-rise apartment buildings along the shore. It's not all that pretty. As I watch the waves, a huge one comes up and splashes on the window. I am surprised. Another one does so. "Hey, we need to move," I say. The woman doesn't agree, "We just got here, and our furniture isn't here and it will be fine." I am adamant. I cry out, startled. She says, "What?" I say, "Never mind." I thought I saw a huge wave, but it was just a big building across the way. Another wave hits. Water splashes inside a bit. "This will ruin everything inside," I say. We have to move. So we do. She is reluctant. I am now traveling down a skinny, curvy road toward the town in a van or VW bus. On one curve we are going too fast and we nearly run off the embankment and crash, but we don't. I scream for a second and then calm down. I hope the next car in our caravan doesn't crash on that corner. (328 words)

I am in a living room with a women's group, like Merton Circle. I get up and go to the kitchen for a snack. I put a tea bag in a glass of boiling water and let it steep a long time. The other women come in and offer to help me. I refuse their help because I am doing fine. I go into another room and there is a baby. I touch her hair and it's coarse and nappy. Someone says, "That's an Asian baby," and I say, "No, black." I then look and see she has Asian slant eyes. I amend my opinion and think she is Asian with an American soldier black father. I like the baby and play with her and pat her hair. Now Dwight comes to me and says he's drunk, so he won't help drive home tonight. I realize that means it's my father and me and I feel tired. I feel a bit resentful, but I'm also glad he was up front about his condition. Dwight then says, "I was supposed to go over to Sonja's house and look at the stairs, to see if I can fix them, but they aren't home. Should I go in anyway?" He is hesitant. I go out and look over to her house. Aunt Esther comes over and says, "Go ahead, go on in." I open a door and go from room to room, very pleased with what I see. Each room is unusual in shape and design. There is hardly any furniture, like the 1950's abstract shapes. There are long, curved rooms with panels of breezy curtains. I see a door with a number on it like this was once an office building. I hesitate and Esther says, "Go on in." I open the double doors (like hotel suite connecting doors) and step into an empty veranda room where the opposite wall is missing, and a huge, warm ocean is there, lapping up to the level of the floor. I gasp and say, "I would kill to have a room like this." I go look at the ocean, trying to see if it is deep or shallow. I see some rocks on the bottom and Lydia goes out wading. It is like bath water. I envy her spontaneity. I don't step in, feeling a bit leery of deep places. I see there are no insects here and think that probably if it were my room, there sure would be and imagine a swarm of black flying insects. I open another door and see a huge bathtub with water in it, and a baby's tub sitting in it. It is like the adult and the baby bath are together in their own luxurious tub. I walk on down the hall and see a kitchen area where there are restaurant type sinks all over the place with water in them, and look for the dining tables. At first I think, "How convenient because the sink would be near the table and you wouldn't even have to get up to wash the dishes." Then, I see the dining table is in another room. Bummer, how inconvenient. (529 words)

I am at a lecture thing, and after the lecture we are asked to step out into a group to discuss. I grumble but go out and try to sit on a bench and a woman suggests we go on to another room. I do, but think maybe we'll get left behind in the backwash in this room. I lay down on a bench and the man comes in to lead the discussion. He asks some questions. I answer a question and a man says, "But that's discriminatory," as an answer to the question. "Say more so I understand," I say because I didn't answer that it was discriminatory to the disabled. He repeats the question. "If a package of benefits were announced as available to the disabled, would that be discriminatory?" I say, "No, it wouldn't because if you had said you are disabled, go get the packet, it would be, but because it is offered in general and a person chooses if they consider themselves disabled, it isn't." The man agrees, I was right. I sigh relief. It would be embarrassing if I hadn't got it right, after all. The second question is about counseling. I raise my hand and say, "That will be easy, I'm a counselor." Another woman on another bench says she is too. Then I need to go across town on the lunch break and get something. I get in a small sports car convertible and am driving. I change into the left lane and notice the cars on the left side traffic take the middle construction lane. "Remember that," I warn myself. I am in S City and feel lost. I say, "This is a small town, I'll learn where things are soon enough." Now a man in a motorcycle is on my right and says, "Got any tunes??" I say no, even though I have a car radio. "Why not try this station?" I say, "I'm new here and don't know the stations. I don't know which one is jazz and so on." I look ahead and see a railroad warning light going and decide to not stop. We are crossing the tracks when I see the train coming suddenly from a blind area on the right, and I slam on my brakes and turn around, practically dragging my car by picking it up around me and walking back. I realize I'd made a wrong decision that could have cost me my life. I am chagrined. "I won't do that again," I say. I park and the man is still on my right, trying to convince me I'd feel better if I turned on the tunes. He says, "I'll show you," and plays a Pat Benatar (or Boone song). I am annoyed with him for pressing it. I know music makes you feel good, I just don't want to do it right now, because he's so insistent. (485 words)

I am hosting a Tonight Show kind of thing and the guests flake out and I carry the whole show. After it is over, I go to my bed to rest. I am exhausted. Capt. James T Kirk (William Shatner) comes to my house because he wants to make love to me. We are already lovers and he is hot for me. He comes in and tells the other people in the house to make themselves scarce. We'll want privacy. One woman says OK, but she's had a hard time today. He says, "I know, the show. They flaked out on her and she had to carry it all." The woman says, "And she came home and had the chills. She may have the flu." William says, "Oh, well, if she doesn't feel like making love, then we won't. We'll just enjoy being together." He comes to my bedroom and says "Hi," and grins, implying his wishes. I sort of groggily smile. He goes back to the living room and is talking to a man when I get up, in panties and a blouse and take off my bra as I walk into the room where he is, now all hot to trot myself. I wave the bra seductively and he grins and excuses himself and we go to my room and make passionate love, to create a baby. It must be done right at that moment. The position is strange, but feels quite normal in the dream. He's laying on his tummy and I sit on his butt. I see the bald spot on the back of his head and kiss it tenderly. Later, we have children and live in this house with many rooms. I see a bedroom where the walls and floor are scuffed and wood chips flaking up and needs to be cleaned up, a dressing room with a curved wall mirror is between two guest bedrooms. In the living room down the hall is a huge gold couch with many sections. I walk in and grin at him, because it is time to make love to have another baby. He gets up and shoos the kids away. He puts an audio tape cassette up my vagina we are in a hurry because we are driven to do it at this very moment in order to get pregnant. We make love; it is great. (398 words)

Ginny, the girls and I go to a school gym where there will be a basketball game I'm to play in. I see stairs here and there and wonder how I'm going to get in. I look in to find someone to ask. I see a woman in a manual chair in there and I notice the gym floor is slanted on a hill. I wonder how one can play on such a surface. I put on ski-like things and sort of skate with them. Ginny rolls down the incline and I skate after her, hitting her accidentally. I apologize. I then learn how to move on these ski things and practice. I do fairly well. Then I decide I must go to the bathroom. I go down the hall. I enter a room. I see Blake and say hi. I had gone into the gym and not tried to find the pre-appointed meeting area for the dream group. In my search for the restroom, I see where the meeting room is. Blake is in uniform, like the army, only I know it's more like a sweat suit for the games. He kind of ignores me. I go back out to the hall. He comes out and says hello. I like seeing him again. We feel shy. His wife comes into the hall, talking a mile a minute. She has two white plastic dessert dishes in her hand. I look at the desserts. They are all pink with a rosette on one. I say, "That's the prettiest dessert I've ever seen." Blake wants to see what I'd call the prettiest. He looks, but she's already eaten the rosette, so it doesn't look like much. She's talking on like a wife of many years and I feel a bit uncomfortable with the edge I hear in their relationship. I tell them about a dream I had about Jeramy. I say I was in the gym and I looked up and there was Jeramy flying around in the air, and behind him on the wall is a huge, golden, metal, round cherub face with sun rays coming out of it, of Jeramy. I tell them I interpreted this to be about spirituality. Then I see a crow circling near Jeramy, and I laughed with delight to see the dream adding the flesh and the blood of this world. Wasn't that a wonderful dream? Blake agrees. I ask if he took notes at the Jeramy workshop because I wasn't there. He said yes. I am sitting on the table in the hall, and out of the gym comes one of the charismatic leaders of the workshop. I greet him joyfully and get up to hug him. As we are hugging, I realize he is a real man and is attracted to me. I let go of him and sit down again. He says something about his 46-year-old son and I realize he's as old as my father. Then Jeramy comes out and I get up and go hug him, happy to see him. He is also happy to see me. I repeat to him the telling of the "Jeramy dream," and as I do, I pause and say, "I was interpreting the dream while I was dreaming. I do that more and more these days." He enjoys hearing the dream. He says, "Did you read," and he says an authors name and I say, "I don't remember." He says it's about the masculine as psychopath, the coyote. "Oh yes, I remember reading that. As a matter of fact, I read that near the time of the workshop where you weren't teaching it, I was having panic attacks." Jeramy and I move back to the table where Blake is. Jeramy says, "I hope you don't mind, but Blake has told me about you and him, and you two are made for each other. What happened?" I stare down at the table I'm leaning, sitting on and fiddle with straightening two pieces of paper. I think, "I don't really know." I say and think some more. (681 words)

I am a playwright and have written a one-woman show. The actress is onstage doing it and I walk down the hall to go peek in to watch the audience response as she does my work. Some women laugh and then they sit quietly, moved by the emotions of the play. I feel a moment of concern that my intimate thoughts are being made public, but then feel OK about it. I try to get closer to see the audience. I step in the curtains and watch the actress doing a scene. She is swinging out on a trapeze bar-like swing out over the audience and back. I remember the actress said she's done this before. I am concerned she'll hurt herself or fall. A small girl is on a swing in the background depicting the childhood memory. There are voices of children teasing, male voices. The actress gets off the swing and almost gets caught up in the chains, but manages to free herself. Now it is near the end of the play I want to be closer to hear the response. I then somehow manage to go to the wrong audience, a group of uniformed men (army brown) watching a show that ends with a commercial selling things. They applaud thunderously. I realize I'm in the wrong place. I go to the next auditorium down the hall and see a huge concert hall and they are applauding thunderously. No, this isn't my play. I return, but it's too late. It's over. I "count the house." Maybe 40 or 50 people saw it, including some uniformed Boy Scouts. I wonder if they understood the play or if it was too painful for them to see. Now I go out in to the hall and the actress (dark haired) comes out. I say, "I wish this had been taped so I could see it. She says, "Well, I did tape it, but who is going to pay for the tape, reimburse me?" I say, "Well, I will." I feel a bit put upon, but am trying to be reasonable. Then she says or does something and I say indignantly, "Do not (either attack or hit or wallop) me." We glare at each other and she goes on to finish whatever she was doing. (383 words)

I am captured by the bad guys like the 1920's gangsters and held in a huge basement like place in a warehouse. I have a gun. They open the large doorway up on the wall and start shooting down at me and I aim and shoot them. I crawl up and out and run. I get in my car and drive for help. I find some of the fellow factory workers and tell them of the incident and have them call the police and then we decide to go back and set up a raid on them. I get in the back seat. A woman drives. We get there and go in. Three or four trucks follow us to cart back the evidence and stuff in their warehouse. We go in, pretending to be customers, and there is a pile of wood sticks and I hold one in my hand as a weapon. I watch carefully as they go send word for a man to come help the costumers. I signal with my eyes to be careful to the other members of my team. The men come up like in an elevator and open their doors and start shooting machine guns at us. I order us to fire and I spray them with my machine gun. With a sinking feeling I realize we are in danger and could die from their bullets, but I keep seated and shooting back. Finally I drop three of the guys, including one holding a large fiddle or small bass. Then the head bad guy grabs one of ours as a hostage and holds a knife to his throat. I drop the machine gun and hold up a rifle to shoot. I say, "Do you believe he could do it if I dropped him?" Dustin Hoffman says out of the side of his mouth (he sits on my left), "Don't be silly. Of course I believe him." I then hold my fire and we are in another standoff. It wasn't supposed to work this way. I try to think how to get the drop on this guy. It's going to be another scary and long battle. (361 words)

I am talking on the phone with Marshall P of D Services and I refer to another guy. I can't remember his name. "Mitchell, is that it? No, Marshall, you know that guy at D. Service, I want to complement him." There is an ominous silence on the other end. I say, "Hello? Hello?" I wonder if I've misspoken and mentioned Marshall's name to Marshall, meaning I didn't know who I was talking to, but I was trying to compliment him. I keep saying, "Hello??" Then we are reconnected. He's not mad at me after all, but the receptionist is pissed. She cut us off deliberately because she is overworked and under-appreciated. Now I'm standing at her desk and she is grumpy and complaining. She shows me all the messages she has to deal with and no one appreciates. Then she goes back to work. She says to me something and I realize she wants to vent her feelings to me. I don't have time or patience to stay and listen. She says, "I'll call you." I say, "OK," feeling a bit put upon, but realizing it's OK since she deserves some help and concern, but why me?? Now I am driving a red pickup. I am parking it in a crowded spot. There are two or three men in the pickup with me, my friends. We are here to watch a great foot race. I have piles of things on the set with us and they slip and slide around, two jars of apple butter and so on. I save one jar from sliding out the door. I look out the windshield and see we are parked next to several TV crews vans. This will be a good vantage point. Now I wiggle around and am in the passenger side. The older man is saying, "What is all this stuff?? There's no room for us." He looks into a sack. I say, "You can put it back in the bed of the truck." He peeks in and it is a huge bag of pillow stuffing the receptionist gave to me. We can't put that back there, it'd get wet and ruined. Now the pickup is sliding forward. I say "Hey, hey, we're rolling." The other man complains and leans on the brakes. We stop just short of hitting the car parked in front of us. The older man backs us up and over a bump to keep us there. We are parked on mud. "We're rolling again," I say. The younger man complains and sluggishly steps on the brakes. Then someone notices it's very crowded around us and we'll only get to see the beginning and the end of the race. So the young man turns on the ignition and drives us out of there. "Hey," I say, "What are you doing? We'll lose our good spot (vantage point)." He says, "It's not worth it, I'll find another." I get angry and raise my voice and swear as I state quite clearly how unhappy I am. He made the decision without consulting us and it's not fair. The older man takes off his glasses, but one of the little nose foot things stays stuck on his face and he smiles and says, "Let's not say mean things that we'll regret." I say, "Don't patronize me." I am angry and am saying exactly what I'm feeling. I know these are my friends and afterward we'll still be friends. I'm not so stupid I'd throw it away on an argument. Now we are on the streets. There is no parking place to be had. I look ahead and see the parade coming right at us. We are forced to turn and park on the side. My friend tries to say this is the best spot, we're in the parade. Then a woman comes up and hands me a sticker and an ink pen. She waits. I realize this is a sticker for a booth owner and will cost us $40.00 dollars if I sign it. We confer. $40 is too much for a parking space. I explain this is the area where food booths and such are set up. I think about selling my books but it's not worth it. We sigh and prepare to go on. Here we thought we'd get to park for free but the establishment was waiting for us, and our money. You gotta pay for what you do. (742 words)

I am trying to get on a commercial airplane to go to Maui, Hawaii. I have a paraplegic stewardess. I am loaded on a stretcher. I have a roll of quarters and want to buy some snacks. She insists I use my gold Visa card. It's more convenient for her. I ask how much each bag of snacks is. 75 cents. That's too much for a tiny bag of snacks. She says the bags are bigger. I wish I'd brought my own snacks on board. Now in the sky I see a weird, small plane next to us and it shouldn't be there, and then somehow I am on that plane and so are some other women and babies and some men. An older man is the pilot and the men, including my husband, are cruel and horrible. They take the women into another room and rape and abuse them. The children are abused. I refuse to go in and I am forced into a tiny cupboard. The women don't fight back. They give in and do what they must to survive. The man is taking us to Washington because that's where he wants to go, not Hawaii as we wanted him to do. Finally, he lands somewhere and the men all get off the pane to do a ritual something. Maybe the old man is dying. I see some of the women go outside and then come back with bars of chocolate. I say, "My God, where did you get that?" She says he had cases of it all along. I go get a huge bar of chocolate. We are getting food and water and talking. Then we see the men are coming back. It is unbearable to think this abuse will continue. I hold a baby whose ears are terribly stretched and malformed because of the abuse. She looks like Dumbo the elephant with her ears. I say, "Who will stop them?" A woman stands with a stick. I join her with a stick. The man comes to the door and he wants in. We poke him with the stick and make him stay outside. This angers him and he sneers and slams the door shut and locks us in. I say, "We have no water. Someone get water." The men are swarming toward us. I get in the pilot set and turn on the ignition. The propellers cough and get caught in the hair of the old man and then it breaks free and I yank on the steering wheel. I hear the men laugh, "She doesn't know how to fly or land." They are grabbing at my legs from the open door on my left. I say to the women, "Protect me, get them," as I frantically try to get above them. Earlier we said we'd stick together this time and fight the men. They do help, but one man clings to the plane as we rise up I get higher and higher. He'd be killed if he dropped. The women let him in. I say, "Keep an eye on him at all times." They agree. We're flying. I hope I can find a place and hope I can land safely. I think for a second about the men, feeling mean for leaving them helpless on the island. (552 words)

I am in a house and changing clothes. I find a reversible pair of jeans and put them on with the pretty lining side up, floral pink and white. My father comes in and says, "You should take your pretty glass case bookshelves." I hesitate, I don't want to take a lot of my old stuff back home, that's why I left it here, but I reconsider. The glass case is very pretty. I agree to do that. Lucy comes in and I say, "I'll be taking back lots of my books and things, I'm packing them." She nods and we go get on the boat, which is like a big hotel. Someone brings books to me and says, "Shall we toss them?" I see a set of big red books that are language books. I regret giving them up, but it's true I haven't used them in years, and if I need them, I can go to the library. I agree he can throw them overboard. I go into my room, and put things away. The captain of the boat is male and somewhat scary. He's trying to get my money and things. I go out on the deck and watch as we start going through the water, a big lake. Then I see Lucy didn't make it on board; she is swimming to catch up, she and her girl child. I yell encouragement to her. She can't reach the ring on a chain at the end of the boat. We are speeding up and she'll be hurt or left behind. I throw out another donut ring like thing (a lifesaver thing). She catches it but leaves her child behind in the form of a small frame with the child photo in it. I see this, hesitate and then dive in, thinking to myself this is stupid, now you're in danger. But I retrieve the photo frame and get back to the boat. Now to get on I must crawl through a tiny plastic covered port hole with a garbage disposal thing in it. I push the shredded salad fixings into the garbage disposal to get room to get through this I try several times. Finally someone on deck, a naked woman, helps me up through this. Now I'm on deck and Lucy sneers at me for being so stupid to dive in when it was unnecessary. She had the photo; it was just an empty frame floating in the water that I retrieved. Then I see some women I knew in Germany and go to talk with them. I look over and see the river is now skinny and shallow, and iced over. We are too big for it and the captain is having a hard time getting the channel. We run aground and I hear the sound of the boat hitting rocks. Now I go back to my cabin. I pass a front door with a message slot in it and search through a pile of slips of paper. There is no message; something ominous is happening. The captain is after me. A boy got killed out on the deck. I go in and see some men, possibly the Captain's men. I get to my cabin to pack quickly. He's tried to steal all my riches, money and jewels but I've tricked him and already hidden them in a secret compartment in my purse. Now I'm wearing a dress suit and heels I get ff the boat and start walking up a steep, gravelly path. It's hard going and I keep glancing around, expecting the Captain to come to me and take my purse. I pick up a rock to use as a weapon, put it down and choose another one with a sharp point on it. I keep walking, noticing other people are around on the hillside and so on. I feel a bit safer. (649 words)

I see a horde of black insects surround a person and feel terrible for them. As I walk on, they then come for me. I see them surround me and I look for help. I see the ocean and run for it; I lay down on my back in the wet sand and crawl backward trying to get into the surf. Finally I get in the water and swim. The insects are off me now and I realize I'm in big waves and deep water. I see a man, who comes to take my hand. I feel some fear because we're going under. He pulls me under and I wonder if I'll drown, and then take a breath and realize I am OK. He takes me deeper and deeper. I wonder to myself, "What I shall ask him for?" knowing this is a journey where I must ask for what I want. I decide to ask him for a relationship, someone to love and someone to love me (like wishing on a star). Now we are on the bottom and we are going past booths that sell all the junk that is tossed away into the ocean, litter. I see lots of plastic toys - interesting, but not anything I want to buy. I need to go back up to the surface and I swim up and up, finally breaking into the air, and discover I am in a deep pond and have traveled back to medieval times. A village is in a meadow and a castle up near the mountains. A prince lives there. I come out of the pond and two young men come by and think I'm a lost princess. They are giving me a tour of the place. I look over to the castle, knowing the prince will come out and maybe find me. I see a deep pit where some poor people are. I say, "What is this?" They say this is where the poor people live who don't have any home. I say, "Then I will stay here for now." They are appalled. I am too good for this place, but I feel it is the right thing for me to do at this point, while waiting for the prince to come. (378 words)

I watch as Uncle Lionel tries to say goodbye to us as we are getting ready to leave. He wants to share his feelings, but is speechless, as it's not natural for him to do this. I feel empathy and go up to him and hug him. He seems very, very tall, like I was a child. I hug him and say, "I know you are afraid and you want to be well and you want me to be well," (and a third person, perhaps Dwight). I take a cough syrup-like medication. I feel very emotionally connected to Lionel. (99 words)

Merle calls and says that he's scared and asks if I will be home on Sunday. He asks me not to go anywhere because if he gets overwhelmed and scared about his new job, then he can call me. I say, "OK, but I might be at a meeting where you are." He says, "Are you sure?" I say, "I'll call Gather and find out for sure." I call and a man answers and I ask, "Am I going to be at the meeting?" He says, "I'll check." I say, "Check now because I'm long distance." He asks, "Where?" I say, "Wilsonville." He asks, "Where's that?" I say, "Way down the river from there." "There" is New N City, on the river. Now I'm traveling there and riding a horse and the baby burros are frisking behind. It's a good thing I can't look behind and see them or I'd feel afraid. I'm not afraid if I don't look. (159 words)

I am in a 1955 kind of car and it gets stuck in a deep mud hole. One of my friends named William gets out of the trunk and helps us get out of the hole. We were headed for escape from some bad guys and the bad guys had directed us to this road. So we decide to back up and take another route. We go cross country, like hilly scrub brush country, and come to the top of a ridge and have to drive down switchback trails to get to the valley floor. I disguise myself as a Mexican young man so the bad guys can't trail us as easily. I hang out with the men, but they start to wonder why I don't go after the ladies. Am I gay? So I make a date with a pretty young lady and put my arm around her and we go away together, but then I tell her the truth that I am a woman and ask her to keep the secret. She does. Later, the car is now a hearse, or at least it used to be. William hangs out in the back section. (196 words)

I keep wondering what I can make to sell at the Saturday Market, that would make money. Then I wonder why I want to do that. Do I enjoy hanging out all day selling stuff? I don't. A man is snide and says he sells anything the public will buy, a child or sexual abuse stuff? He doesn't care, as long as it sells. I turn my back on him in contempt. He or somebody is sweeping up snow or hail from the floor. [BL] (84 words)

I hear or read a story about a group of adventurous women writers who lived in Alaska in the 1800's. One man and four women writers had dog sledded to a conference and were returning on the big ice pack, but the narration says that sometimes the ice pack breaks up in the big thaw and creates dangerous situations and people can slip right in and drown or disappear. I see them sledding and see cracks in the ice, and then I see that they are right on the big crack and some of the sleds are slipping into the water and they are struggling to get back on the ice. They are colorfully dressed, spritely and sweet, lively. One is named Love something, maybe melody or maybe day. I write down what I can of the incident. (138 words)

A Murphy Brown sequence where Miles is surprised for his birthday and rain in the form of silver sprinkles is poured on him. He is confused and upset until we yell happy B'day. A large and ugly man comes in. Another woman and myself go, "Oh no!! Let's dance," and grab each other and dance a silly swooping dance to avoid having to dance with him. Later I sit on a couch with my father and bend the floppy disks. The ugly man is seated nearby and I try to avoid him. Later the woman says she has to leave and the guy follows and I insist another man goes to look out for her. Later I am in a car which now looks like a crib with a man and a woman and me in it. I get out and it is a balancing act for them to readjust their positions so they don't tip over. Later, I see a carnival like thing on the side of the road and see "Queen Elizabeth" being hawked as a novelty sight. I start to go over and see her but a woman says, "She's not real, you know. That's not really Queen Elizabeth." I say, "I know," and go on over. I get up close and see an ugly, dark-haired woman, the maid, and she sees that I know her, and flinches. I say, "It's all right. I'll pretend you are Queen Elizabeth so you won't get in trouble." (248 words)

Dovre and I are looking at a beautiful scene, a wedding scene in Malaysia. I lie down on a cushion and slide on it to the edge, because I don't feel comfortable standing up and walking down the stairs. There are no railings and I could lose my balance. I am intrigued with the man being married to this woman. I watch him. He then goes into outer space and I stow away to be near him, me and my small daughter. We are drawn closer and closer, in love with each other, but he is married. Finally, we sent the baby out in a little container to practice space travel and knowing when you are right side up, and we couple, like two ink pens together. He says, "This is as undressed as you can get in outer space." It feels good and I have a hard time reaching his face to kiss him. Now we are going back and I feel sad because I will be found out and he'll go back to his wife. (177 words)

Now we are coming to earth and I realize I've made a wrong decision. He has gone back to his drugs and he's a teen boy now and hangs out in another space capsule, being irresponsible and taking his drugs. I go out to confront him. Dovre is wiped out on drugs also. They blame each other and I see Dovre is holding her baby and the baby is distressed. I forcibly take the baby from her and leave them to their misery; they will have to choose to come out of it themselves and I dedicate myself to caring for the baby. She now sleeps cozily on my shoulder. Another woman (my mother?) has another baby she is carrying for. I realize this is what I need to do. I need to go back and care for the baby and do it right this time, giving freely of my time and energy to protect the baby. (157 words)

I'm in a room and am going to get ready. I'll take my bath tonight so the room will be available for others at the peak time. I'm choosing my outfit and try to decide which one to wear. I look out the window and see a car drive by with Jack Palance in it. Perhaps he'd been working on a movie up the road. Then another one goes by with another movie star. I relate this to a man, and I can't remember Jack Palance's name and describe the movie he was in and so on, then I remember his name. The head knight comes into the room, which is an adjoining connecting room to the one I'm in and says, "The dragon is here. Quick shut the doors." I see a slithery, huge green boa constrictor-like thing that slithers into the connecting room. I slam the door shut. I struggle to lock it. The knights are called in to fight it. A small rectangular opening panel in the top portion of the door is open and the tentacles of the dragon start to reach through it. I slam it shut and try to hold it shut. It almost gets me. Then I get it shut. He's huge and breathing and in there. We wait. The knights now go down the hall to sleep. I am a princess now, and there is my queen mother. I pace. Now the door is open and the face of a huge green dragon is in the doorway. I pick up a golden bow and arrow and try to shoot it myself. The arrow is weak. It hits its mark, but has no power. He laughs at me. I try again. He says, "Only you can kill me and only with the golden arrow." I call out to the knights. I run down the hall, pounding on the doors of the bed chambers and yell, "Get up. The dragon is here." They stumble out sleepily. I run back into the room and look to see a huge golden and white dragon, the King Dragon, it is now transformed to. He somehow hands me some small golden and other colored round circles like sparkly confetti. I hold a small cross-shaped metal thing in one hand. I put the round circle on it and throw it at the advancing king dragon. His head is getting closer and closer. I throw and throw and finally I pick up the golden one, the One he gave me, and throw it. It hits, and falls off, but it is enough. The King dragon kind of smiles, and is very close to me, and then blows a breath right in my face. He laughs because I had slain him as I ought to have and he was making a joke about being a fire-breathing dragon, all dead now with not even a hot breath left to get me. He says, "Throw it in again." I pick up the thing and throw it at him again. He is stopped. Somewhere in there my mother the queen says something and I tell her to shut up. (525 words)

I am in my "apartment" and trying to do my breakfast. Millie has been cleaning and has moved things. I see my toaster is clear across the room and the bananas and bread are in a drawer, organized nicely, but I'd have to walk to get it. I see an old Xmas tree and decorations. I know it's four months past Xmas and past time to take down the tree. I say, "I think you should," then I notice she already has cleaned that up. I say, "I really appreciate you helping but you've got to leave things the way I had them so I can independently use the place." She says, "But I'm here to help you. You have so much space here that isn't being used, just going to waste, with all your things crowded up together like that." I am annoyed she doesn't understand that she won't always be there when I need her, and I like to have it ready so I can do things myself so I won't get left abandoned and helpless. (178 words)

I am in a room and have over $200 in cash and a woman says, "Oh, that's dangerous, to have cash around, someone could rob you." I am annoyed at her, because I'd have cash and no one cares and I wasn't robbed. A train comes very fast to the station. I stand near the tracks waiting. I kiss the track quickly like I'm sending a kiss to the man I like who works on the railroad. I am then embarrassed if he should see me. I see an arm waving from a place on down the train. A car suddenly rushes very fast past me, getting out of the way of the train. (114 words)

I am in a wheelchair and at some tourist attraction. I want to go down the path to see it, but everyone says, "No way, you can't. You're in a wheelchair and it is inaccessible." I look. It does look bad, but I don't give up, I go on down the road and discover another path, one I think I can do. I head down it. It is hard, gravely and dirt and curvy and steep. I slip and slide, but make it. I feel quite victorious when I arrive at the bottom. Everyone kind of stares at me, and avoids me. I go to the boat dock. Many boats come up, one at a time, and get tourists to take them to the island. I want to get on, but they can't imagine how I could, with the wheelchair. I get in the way of a man looking for more tourists for his boat and force him to take me. I get in his tiny blue boat, but get back out because it would mean I'd travel alone. I go to a canoe shaped boat and see a seat where the invalids can lay down. I get in that, but remain seated. I think about how I'll have to leave my chair here and then decide I'll need it on the island and think it into the boat. A young Malaysian woman sits in front of me. We come by the side where the attraction is. It's hot springs, geysers and such where the people have built what look like window frames and the shapes of houses around the naturally occurring rocks and geysers. It's kind of Victorian garish. We come close to it and I reach out my hand to touch the water from the geyser. The Malaysian woman is terribly offended and grabs my hand back. I say"What?" She says, "It is for drinking, not touching!" I am surprised, but hey, I didn't know. She says, "I wasn't going to say anything, seeing as how it is cultural ignorance, but--." I say "It's OK." I feel caught and embarrassed, and yet, how was I to know? We go on. The canoe is skinny and shallow. I wonder if the ocean waves will slop into the boat. I hang on tightly. It's a smooth ride and I wonder why I don't feel the waves. We arrive at the island and I get out and into the chair. It's a museum and I wander around kind of disappointed because it looks very American -- nothing special and exotic, just American. (431 words)

I am running a rehearsal of a dance piece I wrote. I waited too long to get it organized and I'm given a bad date, after school is out and people won't be around as much. I realize it's my own fault. I call the dancers together and they are unmotivated, confused, late and wandering around. I am yelling like a director or master sergeant, coercing and cajoling and demanding and complimenting. We have too many props and too many dancers. It is crowded and confusing. The curtains are closed and out in the audience area are several men, important, listening into what I do with this mess. I am doing well, getting things cleaned out and motivated. (118 words)

I am standing in a group of people all entangled together in a sort of circle. We are singing a song and entwining our arms and holding hands. It is awkward. I have something in my hand and yet managed to keep connected. After we are done, Marilyn steps over and says we could do some choir work. I nod, but my attention is on this bunch of food I need to take, care of slabs of meat in packages. I need to get them frozen and put away and decide to put a refridge in the area we're at, rather than drag it all home. I want to make a lunch. I go home and it's a mess there -- food all over, dirty dishes. Marilyn starts cleaning and I say with relief, "Ah, you've started back to work." I pay her to clean up, but it's been a while. There's lots to do. She is energetic and efficient. I am glad. There's something about traveling, maybe on a bus. (171 words)

Uncle Joel and his young wife. Somehow I have had sexual relations with them both, and I am shocked, because that would be incest. He's an Uncle after all, a brother of my father. She is Marci energy. Now I'm holding a hamburger and offer to cook dinner. I plop it on a stove and decide to cook some rice. I search for the right sauce pan size and finally find some, but I have to wash it first and I start to do some dishes. A Mom-like woman says, "You don't have to do the dishes." I say, "It's OK, just the ones I need for now." I feel good standing. Now I go to a fair. I have a handful of quarters. I am going to pay for my admission and Caroline's dad (younger like late 20's) says, "No, I'll pay. You don't have to." I say, "No, I insist. It isn't much and I have it." Caroline demands her share and then decides to go to her room. I say, "You come back here now." She refuses. I insist. A classic power struggle. I get angry. She reluctantly returns. We go in to find our seats. Each event happens in a different room and the first event is in a small room. Then Ginny is around. We (Uncle Joel? and I) go to find the fantasy corner, because we were told to. I see it and lay down to peek down the corner. I see a young woman like a Vanna White to show what is in the corner. I look and see a pile of books. "Oh, the sci-fi ones I like...," and three copies of a hardbound red book with the title in black, "Minot." "I have that one but haven't read it," I say. A couple of books are in a different language and must be for the other person, possibly an alien, with me. Later, someone is gathering things and putting them in a display. A woman behind me, like Ginny, holds the rabbit balls I gave her. She offers them up to the man setting up the display. He looks at them and I feel embarrassed. This isn't much. They'll laugh or reject them. He opens one and a small fetal creature is in it and he asks, "What is it?" I say, "It's a rabbit. See the teeth?" They disagree until they look and see the teeth. I see them. They are even and nicely shaped human teeth, the only feature in this white mass of stuff. No one is pleased, and I look up to see a cloud where the lion god lives with his many young wives. He rolls over, unimpressed, and makes love to several of his nubile wives who are very pretty. I am stunned I am seeing this and also embarrassed. Then the wives are gathered together and very happy to hear about the rabbits because they can check and see if they are pregnant. One rubs her tummy and says she has had symptoms already. (510 words)

I am doing an absurd skit with Justin. We run about the garden looking at trees and making jokes. He says we must only look for the A tree and the B tree. I run around in an English way with an English accent and say, "Oh where could the 'A' tree be? Oh, here it is." He follows me around closely, trying to be the tree. I ignore him. "Oh, where is the 'B' tree? Here? No, here? No, ooh here it is, no, that's a bee, an insect, not a tree. Then here? Now here's an interesting tree! Look over there, it has a very interesting root structure, if we only could see it. We lay down on the ground and he picks up the bottom of the raised root structure (like mangrove trees) and I snicker and say, "Oh I must be wrong," but if it were the right tree, then it would be all raised and interesting. We are laying there next to each other, teasing. A man opens the door and stares down at us. Finally we get up and he glares and says, "Are you going to do this again?" We humbly say no, trying not to laugh. "Good," he says dourly and slams the door. We giggle and Justin says, "Where is a kissing tree?" I laugh and go to him and put my arms around him and kiss him saying, Here. I found one, a kissing tree." [BL] (245 words)

I live in this house with lots of rooms. I don't use most of them. I want a puppy and get one, but I want it to be smaller and cuter. Now there are many tiny kittens and a puppy. I pick some up and hug them and carry them around with me. I remember a back living room and my old TV is in there and I wonder why I never go use that room. I see connecting doors between rooms and remember this house is on the state line. Cars line up. One is going to drive through the connecting rooms and gets stuck or stopped and the next car screeches to a halt, nearly crashing, and the next and so on. There is a chain reaction pile up. Luckily no one really crashes. I am impressed. I go in to see what's the problem. These people are coming to buy the booze I can legally make on one side of the house and sell to the folks on the other side where it's illegal to make it. I go back into the living room, wanting to use the rooms more. I see an old file cabinet and look. The previous owners, old ladies, had their files in there. One of these days I need to clean it out. I look in. There are some empty files, in Braille, and lots of old papers. I pick up an Xmas card from a pile of letters and cards. It's from Pete and B and some other people. They look like the ones I have in my cards and letter box. (271 words)

I am in the teacher's lounge getting ready to do my Evangeline thing. I am choosing my scripts to do and getting them laid out. A male teacher likes me and he's kind of a drunk. I try to avoid him and he leans into me and I back away and so on. Then I notice it is nearly 1 o'clock, and someone is on stage talking. I was supposed to be first because I had a 1:30 appointment across town. I am flustered. Now I can't find the scripts that I had set aside and they are calling me to the stage. I'll be late, but I go on toward the stage, asking Bonnie to look for my scripts for me and bring them to me when she finds them. I then see my cute little girl with ringlets in her hair. She has a huge bag of barbeque potato chips. It is ripped open and she's snacking. I say to her, "Come here!" She walks away toward the auditorium, trying to avoid me. I say, "Don't you do that! Come here now." She does, resentfully. I say, "You went home and got these, didn't you?" (Apparently we lived next door to the school.) She nods yes. I say, "Don't do that again." She frowns. I take away the bag of chips. I go up on stage and I'm introduced. Only a few teachers are in the lunchroom audience. I am walking. I apologize and explain that the scripts are missing and are being looked for. I chat about how I started the Can Do show on cable TV and had to create a show every two weeks. We called it heart attack theatre, because we'd have two weeks to prepare for the show. Somehow at the beginning of the two weeks it seemed we had plenty of time, but then it would be Thursday night and I'd have to produce the show. I had no time to rehearse and memorize my lines, so I created a character who had her words on a piece of paper. Clever huh? I went on it in this realistic way. Bonnie comes in with the red notebook of original scripts. I search through it to find a script. I see computer docs. It is past 1:30 and I'm late, but oh well. Maybe Bonnie can call and tell them that I am going to be late. Things just aren't working out. Everyone seems OK with it all. (415 words)

I hold a tiny boy baby and ask how old he is. He says 11 months. I am amazed because he is so small, like a toy doll, skinny. There are three of them. I like them. I think they are "cousins" or babies of cousins. My mother and Aunt Millie are in a bed and talking and I try to overhear. My mother says, "So that's how you tell? You smell them?" Millie talks. I think, "Aha, someone is having an affair, maybe my father." I want to listen in and get all the info. I am interrupted by people talking, and new arrivals to the reunion party we are at. I suck on a cannelloni noodle until the meat filling is all gone. Somehow, that was one of the babies. (132 words)

I visit the C. dept at a meeting and don't see many people I know. I sit on a couch next to a black man who has a stop watch. He puts it on my lap and says, "Is that OK?" I say ok. Then it stops. He picks it up and restarts it. It stops again. He lays it aside. I get up and walk around. There are large appliances I crawl around on like I was kid size and they were adult size. The black man and I are teasing each other, playing like kids. He turns on a switch and a sound like a blender whirs. It gets annoying and I climb down from the top of the refridge and get footing on the toilet cover and go over and turn off the switch. The black man lays on the floor laughing. Then I hear a buzzing sound and finally figure out it is a telephone thing and pick it up, the black receiver, and I hear a male voice, like my father's. He says something and says, "Tell Willis to come to the V's, you know, like our way. And tell LoKey Junior." I write his name down, not knowing who that is. (207 words)

I am a woman and two men harass me. I run away. I steal one of their bicycles and then they chase me and we are in traffic and I peddle. Then I abandon the bicycle in the bushes behind a gas station and go into the station to call someone and the two men come after me and I try to hide in a room. They come to the door and I hold it closed against them. He has the keys and gets them out and I hold the door hard. He pushes, and then as he pushes to get in, I slide out and into the next adjoining room. They come to that room and I quickly hide up in the attic area through a crawl hole and replace the panel and hope they don't find me. Then somehow I am Marilyn of Northern Exposure like and on a horse wearing a beautiful whit fur cape. The chief of the tribe says, "You can have it; take it away for all we care. We prefer to not have it around." I am angry because I had been harassed and hounded and feared for my life because of this cape. We (the two men and I) ride out into the snow. Finally, in tremendous anger, I force the one man off his horse. He is shocked. I scream at him. I am angry. We'll finish it now. He is going to strike out at me and I don't care. I am livid with anger long held in from his bad frightening attacks on me. He is Indian and hides in his yellow fur parka and I made some sign at him and say, "You stay in there; you can use the shield." Somehow his spirit was going to come out and kill me and I am fighting it. It's like I've gone berserk from the pent-up up rage. They aren't going to treat me badly any longer. (328 words)

I am holding a sweet little girl in my arms. A man I love walks beside me. We are in some kind of time warp. Someone sees a large picture of Abraham Lincoln on a wall and I am drawn to his dark sad eyes. Something is behind that picture. We rip it off the wall and see writing. It says "B was here in November." It was written by the man to prove I was here before this. But now I am realizing that we must die. I am filled with grief. I hug the girl to me. I ask someone, a doctor perhaps, what will it feel like when the moment of death comes. I decide it will be a drink of poison, a big dose. I hold the girl and say, "I'm so sorry." She says, "It's all right. You have to do it" (meaning kill her). I sob and sob and she comforts me. I am walking into a house. Her family of this time, a man and woman, are harsh and I scream at them to leave us alone. Now I am walking in the waves of an ocean. We are walking along the beach in the surf, facing perpendicular to the waves. They hit from the right side. Sometimes the waves are like paper roses that spray over us. I say to the man I love, I'll die with you. I'll kill you two and then I'll drink the poison too." He begs me not to. He says I must live because if I don't then no one will write about them and then they will be truly dead. I sob and sob, clutching him in a side embrace. "How can I live when all I love is dead?" I sob. We go into a room and I hug him, sobbing and sobbing. My mother is there, and I confronted her. (317 words)

I am with Jock and we are going to visit a writer at his house. Jock goes on ahead in a car and I lose him immediately. I stand on a grassy area where the road goes both left and right and I wonder which way Jock went. Someone says, "There he is." I look to the left and see his car parked at a house by the sea. I follow along and go there. Now I'm being given a tour of the house. Robin, the scriptwriter teacher, lives there with his wife. There are beautiful curtains that can be pulled down in six lovely different designs. A big window is present to see the lovely view. The ocean is off in the distance to the right, so when you want, you can go sit at the window and look at it. There is a kind of wooden tree fence which has spaces between each tree so you can still see the ocean, but it is not a totally open view. This seems a good thing. I admire this house saying, "If I had a house, this would be it." Jock tries to show me the different designs the curtains make. There is gray and pink wallpaper, but I wouldn't have chosen the swans on it. I love the colors, though. (221 words)

I am in the living room and Dovre is out on the porch talking with some people who are demonstrating a car seat and how it folds up and so on. I come out and watch. I ask her what she's doing and she says she wants to buy some seat belts and they have some, but she did it wrong. They came to her and said, "This is how much I want." I say to her, "You could then say to them, 'This is how much I'm willing to pay,' and see if they will dicker." She likes this idea and goes to them to dicker. I walk back into the house very aware that I would be embarrassed to dicker and leave it cravenly to her. I see the little baby girl and go pick her up and discover she has on some of my jewelry. I tell her it is not OK to take things that belong to other people, and begin to remove the many rings and necklaces off her chubby fingers and neck. She resists. I explain how we must ask permission first. She doesn't care; she just wants the jewelry. I tell her if she comes back in and takes my jewelry, then I will take it back, take her to her room and lock it and then take some of her things away. I feel mean. She is incorrigible. I keep removing more jewelry, black beaded necklaces. I find an ugly plastic lime bracelet. She says, "At least let me keep that one, it has my name on it (Fred)." I say, "This is Dovre's; we will ask her permission and if she says yes, you can keep it." (286 words)

I am seated on a couch with Rochelle. We are on a pile of freshly done laundry, clothes, towels, etc. Rochelle is figuring up something on her calculator. It gets overheated and she tosses it across the room on the floor. She throws herself behind the couch and I sit there and wait. The battery pops out of the calculator and then overheats and burns and smokes. The air is thick with bad smells. I get up and walk outside. It's time to leave now and I get in my red pickup truck and drive over to say goodbye to Dwight (Rock Hudson?). I walk into the house and find him. We then walk out the back side door. I see many cars and hub caps lined up neatly. He says, "The used car man next door puts them there during the day." As we walk to the pickup, I remember I didn't take my card he gave me as a farewell. I ask him to go back and get it for me. He does so. I get into the driver's seat of the pickup and see that he has put a store of sugar free snacks in there for me to enjoy on my trip. I am touched. Dwight gets in with the card. I thank him for his thoughtful gift. He smiles. Jake is now in the back seat. He has put a special hand hold on the steering wheel for me to use. I thank him and try to use it. It is uncomfortable. I say, "I'm sorry but I need it back the way it was." He apologizes. I say, "Oh no, I thank you for the thought, but it just isn't working out." He fixes it. Pink liquid and oil and so on pours into the column of the steering wheel and then he fixes it back the way it was. I suddenly remember I had forgotten my wheelchair, crutches, pills and raised toilet seat back at Rochelle's. I was feeling so good, I just forgot them. I send someone back to get them for me. She returns with it. Several aunts are there with babies to wave me goodbye. (365 words)

I am captured by a bad guy who is going to have sex with me and then kill me. He and his henchmen get us (four of us). I try to run. He has guns. He is chasing. We are wondering where the nearest safe place is. Then I see Josh. I tell him we need a place to hide and he says, "You can hide in here." We start to hide when we see him drive up. He'll see us. We hide in a closet. The man comes in with a rifle and is looking around. Now I feel bad for Josh who is in danger because of us. He is diverting them to the outside when the woman driver who we escaped from enters with a gun. Josh says, "That's my wife." Uh oh! Dilemma. Where are his loyalties? He acquiesces and stops helping us. I see Josh and look at him, wondering if he'd still help us. The feeling is he would if he could.

Paul and I were lovers many years ago. I see him surrounded by his adoring fans. He looks up and says, "Who is that?" I say, "B." He doesn't recognize the name, so I say Lydia (I think) which was my name when I was younger. He realizes it's me and comes out of the group to meet me. We meet and embrace. It is very tender. We obviously still love each other. He is pregnant and old and soft. I lovingly put my hands on his belly to feel the full belly with child. Then I gently touch his face. We walk together in an embrace, kissing very tenderly now and then. I ask how he is. He says, "Married, did you think I'd just wait after you left me?" I wonder how I ever managed to leave Paul Newman. He has children in his marriage. He says, "It's my door; I want it shut." He knocks over some kitchen metal things that were propping the door open and it shuts. She comes out. She is pretending to be mad at him, but she is only affectionately scolding him. I pick it up and say, "I'll do your toenails." Paul says, "Mine?" He's quite content for me to do that. I say, "No, Tia's, your daughter's, if she'll let me, so there, Mr. who-loves-pink-and-gray" (or who looks good in pink and gray). Now I have a picture of the weeping willow Paul and I kissed under. I look at it sadly with loving regret. Paul sees this and sighs, looking at me with love. We both love each other so much, but it won't work because he is married and has a family.

I am a man who works too much, very responsible. A younger man is trying to convince me to hang out with him and have a bit of fun. I am sort of a policeman detective type person and am on a case. Just as the tiger lunges for me, I fire the shotgun in his mouth and he dies right next to me. The policeman comes and gives details of the case to his superior officer. Now I am he and wheeling down the sidewalk. The young man invites me to come to his commencement party. I say, "I can't, I have work to do." Then I say, "Oh, what the hell, why not?" and start to cross the street, against the light. I look to see if cars are coming; they aren't and I go. I see a dark sky to my left and ahead, a huge rainstorm. As I get to the other side of the street, the rains start. I hope I have my poncho to put on.

He walks up to me and hugs me gently and says in a lecturing tone, "Now dear, you left your chair out in the rain. It could have been ruined." I grit my teeth and say thinly, "Thank you." We hug but I am distant and angry. He feels that. He says, "What's wrong?" I say, "What's wrong? I don't have to do what you tell me. I don't like that tone you take like you are my owner now that we are married. This isn't working out." I site another incident where he gently, tyrannically insists I do what he wants me to do. I resent that tone and don't want to knuckle under. Meanwhile the torrential rains pour down outside.

One sleeps on the right side of the couch bed thing I am using to bath the baby. The other is trying to help me by getting the water and so on. I finally get him shampooed on his head and then I see I didn't rinse off the shampoo. I hold his head under a faucet spray thing and get it cleaned off, get a blue crocheted thing on him for a diaper and only get one side pinned and then I see he's had a bowel movement. I decide not to clean him up again because it is such hard work and someone on the next shift can do it better. Now I hand him over to another woman and we are packing his things. She puts him on the arm of Uncle Lionel who sits on another couch and says he likes to be touched. So Uncle Lionel lets him lean on him. I sit on the couch at the other end, and as the baby leans back, I put my legs up on the couch to create a fence to hold him. Uncle puts his leg up also and we keep him safe. I say, "This baby sure has grown since this morning," aware that is pretty fast growth. [NOTE: ALL FEMALE CHARACTERS (AND ASSOCIATED NARRATIVE) WERE DELETED FROM THIS DREAM REPORT.] (242 words)

Now he and I are seated side by side in an invisible vehicle and he's driving backwards along the coastline. I look back over my shoulder, apprehensive he'll drive us into the ocean. He parks in the grasses where we can see cars drive like they are going to hit us and then they go past. A cop goes by. He says, "Hope he doesn't catch us. I kind of do this a lot." I say, "How often?" He says "Oh, 10, 11 times a day." I say, "OH! Obsessive! The cop doesn't approve." Ethan puts his arm around me.

I see a large goldfish in a cute, hooded suit standing on its fins on dry land next to the pond. A cat is nearby and the fish chases it away. I wonder if it can last much longer before getting back in water. Later, I am in a huge house, a mansion. I live there and am exploring the many rooms. I see a series of unexplored rooms off the back and side. One has a huge barber chair in it; another has pinball machines. Another has a bunch of wall clocks that are all exactly alike, no frames, just the numbers in a circle and the hands going around. I consider that a real waste of money. Why would anyone do that? A group of men, musicians, come in from the side door and they each have instruments. The one I talk with has a mandolin in a cloth case. I say, "What, go out there without even the protection of a banjo in front of me?" Later, I go outside and see a huge shallow place where it used to be a swim pool. Someone fills it with water. It's shallow but swimable. Now I am on a boat, fishing. I am catching salmon and doing it expertly and well. The driver of the boat is a good-looking man who is very pleased with my matter of fact style of fishing. Then I catch a big one. I'm quite excited. "Oh dear," I say, "what if it's a dolphin? Or a shark?" I let it go. Now we get back to the mansion and I'm getting dolled up for the prom party that night. I have a younger sister. We look great. We walk down the stairs. I think the party is in honor of an older grandmother, matriarch. That same man who was the driver of the boat now comes over and invites me to dance. I curl up in his arms and we are a perfect fit. He feels just right. I like being near him. I don't want the dance to stop. We are interrupted by another man. I dance with him, aware that he doesn't feel as good. I am glad to get back to my love.

My father and my mother and an Aunt are in the tiny bathroom with me and my father is trying to fix the molding around the edge of the room and this yellow urine puddle is building. I am so embarrassed. I say, "I'm sorry. No matter how hard I try to keep it in the toilet, it leaks out." They help clean it up and try to make light of it.

I have a baby girl who stares at her and ask why she has such short legs. I try to shush the girl as I don't want the woman to be offended and hurt us even worse.

Now I am at another table and am exposing the man who isn't what he says he is. Everyone is shocked to learn this. I feel bad doing this, but it is necessary. Now I go to the window and see a store and people are going in and out and then I realize it is on fire. I see some smoke in the second story. I see people still trying to go in and think that is strange they would chance going shopping in a burning building, although the fire isn't seen yet as it is still small. Then the building suddenly is gone and I am shocked. It is supposed to be there but all I see is a new street intersection. I realize I am looking at a future picture. Later I am at a table with a woman and a woman bartender talking about dreams. We are impressed with their completeness and beauty. Later out the window I see the building again. [BL] (166 words)

I am in charge of setting the family feast table. I run from one end to the other overseeing. People bring in dish after dish of good foods. I try to organize them in some way, the main dishes here, the salads together there, a bowl of lemon slices at each end of the table. Across the table and facing me is a man watching. He is pleased with me. (70 words)

I am feeling strong emotion and want to go to a cafe where I can sit alone and write about it, or feel it. I walk and walk. I see a cafe, but it's closed. I go to the outskirts of town and see some pancake houses. I go into one and as I am standing at the counter. I talk to a woman friend, maybe Ginny. I have decided to buy an eye thing for this mentally retarded girl so she can see out of her bad eye. It's like buying her an eyeball for part of one so she can see. I'm going to put it on my Visa. As I am doing this, Nate suddenly comes up to me from behind. I see him and I see his 12-year-old son. So we talk like strangers or acquaintances. The back of his son's head is bumpy and big and ill formed. So are his ears. My father is the man at the counter doing my Visa. He hands it back and I ask if he put it in the right (correct) pocket. He hasn't and I'm a bit annoyed. Nate's wife comes in and I try to behave normally and nonchalant. I tell him I'm buying this eye thing for this MR girl. I feel a bit self-righteous. I am then putting my things back in my purse and decide to give my paper toy train cutouts to the son. I hand him one his father has already put together for me and then I see a line of paper doll cutouts all holding hands and give them to him and then see a line of little black animals and give him that. Now I am on my way. (291 words)

Jared invites me to sit next to him on the couch. I don't want to, but hesitate. Finally, I say, as an excuse, "The couch is too low for me to be comfortable, but I prefer to sit on the chair next to the couch. See, we'll still be sitting close together." A compromise. I go to sit on the chair and then a woman, the mother of a man in the room, says, "Did you throw up in here?" I feel sticky stuff on my pants leg on the right side and see purple gunk. I stand up. The mother follows me into the next room to assist me in cleaning up. Dora is there helping. We agree it is best to take the pants off so she can thoroughly clean them. I go into the adjoining room to sit on the bed so I can take them off. (150 words)

I am helping a man study some bats. He's a nice man. I like him. We go down to a room where the bats are. We have to be careful. Now we are in a tiny, square room between the down room and the up room, to protect ourselves from the bats, which could attack. Now the man goes upstairs and the other people too, to have lunch. I stay and study the bats. I'd like some lunch, but they don't offer any and I don't ask. I continue working on the bats. (93 words)

I am at a table-like thing; cousin Sebastian and others are there. I am eating my toast and then I want the toast left over on the other end of the table. I can't seem to fill myself up. I lick the jelly off a yellow plastic thing and then get a bit queasy when I realize the paint is in with the jelly. I need to pee, so I go to the women's room. There are two tiny potty chairs, already being used. I go stand up over a toilet no one is supposed to use and pull the shower curtain closed around it. I pee. Delores M comes in. We chat.

I am flying my own little plane, a two engine something and I notice I am low down like the scene might be seen from a car. It is too low, so I decide to pull it up to 5000 feet, above anything I could hit, like wires or low mountains. I have a hard time getting it up there and feel a bit afraid of heights, but I see the view is breathtaking. I am headed toward M City. Now my parents are calling me on the radio. I have a hard time hearing them and they have to repeat things. They say they have some things they need too talk over with me and can I come over. I say, "OK, I'll do that now; over and out." I call to the airport for landing instructions. The name of my plane is the BabyJo, and some numbers. They tell me what altitude and what direction. I fly over a low hill that is sort of an open air museum of ancient Aztec-like round calendars stones with hieroglyphics on them. I think I'd like to go down there and look sometime. I see one of the smaller stones and think, "Now that one REALLY is ours. The others are probably loaned out to us by the big museum system, and belong to everybody." I find the airport, a circle on the plains, with a runway. I come down OK. The men who work at the airport really want to meet me. I have some reputation they admire. (258 words)

I am working a script and Ernie is there. I think I'm at his house. Ricardo and Rigo are there too. Now I want to go out, perhaps to a rehearsal. I borrow Ernie's car. Ricardo has the keys. I run out to get them from him before he leaves. The key is shaped like a tiny miniature loaf of bread. I have trouble getting the key turned in the ignition. Then I am backing up and nearly hit a car behind me. The car doesn't stop very well and I must really press hard and long on the brakes, but still I slide and keep moving slowly. Ernie is outside looking around the rear bumper saying, "Be careful, you nearly hit that car." I am annoyed because I knew what I was doing and didn't hit it. I am also feeling some relief that I had managed to not hit the car, as it's almost out of my control. I drive forward, slipping and sliding, and look carefully to see if cars are coming. Ernie is concerned that I'll screw up. (182 words)

I am given a task of teaching. I must prepare a series of questions and so on as I will moderate or facilitate a panel discussion on topics given me by my woman boss. It's a big job. I set to work reading the questions and trying to come up with answers so I know the subjects. She comes in and says, "We need to do it now." I'm not ready, but I gamely say I can do it. I kinda think maybe I can manage it. I need to go to the bathroom. We're sort of in the old M City house. I go upstairs and step into a tiny bathroom at the top of the stairs (which never existed in the real M City house). The toilet is broken. There is no seat; it is blue and chipped and not too clean. I remember there is the regular bathroom downstairs at the foot of the stairs and decide to go where it is more comfortable. I kind of peek into the door of the bedroom that used to be my parents'. I don't see much. I go back downstairs. I see a very high step where one of the steps had been removed, probably the one that squeaked and was cracked when I lived there. It's hard to make the step, but I do. I knock on the bathroom door. A woman opens the door and is showing me creams and things for the face, like I was a teen and she was showing me the right way to do makeup. She takes a huge glob of Vaseline in one hand and a huge glob of lotion in the other and mixes them together, all the while lecturing me how oil and water don't mix and this will be very bad to do on the face. I think this is a waste of lots of material, because she uses so much. I leave, not buying anything, feeling a bit guilty as she wasted so much to show me. I go into the kitchen, and pick up my papers. I need to buy stamps now for the teaching job I'm about to do. I buy them from the woman of the lotions. I go into the other room and ask my woman boss did she pay the woman for the stamps? The boss says, "No, you need to do that, but I can partially reimburse you later." What a nuisance, but I return to pay her I ask her how much I owe. She figures for a while and then says 140 dollars. I am shocked that is much more than I thought it was worth. I am frustrated, but feel I must pay it, but resent it. I start to take out the money and first give her some coins -- quarters, pennies, a half dollar coin. I ask how much I've given her so far. She says, "You're one point short." I am annoyed. What does that mean? I ask shortly, "Does that mean 99 cents?" She sighs at me, exasperated. "98 cents," she says, like I should know that. I've got a long way to go to make 140 dollars. I pull out the cash, and lay out the full amount, not liking doing this. (549 words)

I live in an apartment at the top of the stairs. Apparently they are giving a tour of the building because people are coming in. I don't want them in and I run to the side door and slam it shut and lock it and go to the living room and shut the drapes, and make a sign that says "Not On Tour" and tape it to the front door and slam it shut, but not before a man, a woman, and a teen girl come in. They are stealing things from me and I go to the bedroom and get my shotgun. I come out and point it at the man. He laughs, and continues to take things. I aim at a shoulder or a leg, a nonvital part, and I shoot. I mean business. He backs off. I shoot the woman in the stomach and she falls out of the room and down some stairs. I go to see her and she is curled in a fetal ball with lots of blood coming out of her belly area. Now I pick her up and run to the emergency room with her. They are busy and not too caring there. I carry her to a bed a nurse takes me to. (212 words)
Barb Sanders:#2522 (06/20/93)

Now I am back at the apartment and the teen daughter returns. It is Lydia's "daughter" and Lydia was the woman I had shot, sort of. The daughter is being evasive and I suspect she has taken drugs. We, the woman and I, pick her up as she fights us, and take her to the emergency room. She insists she's fine and hasn't taken drugs. Again we go to the emergency room. We follow the nurse down the hall to a five-bed ward. We choose a bed for her to rest in. I look the room over and decide we chose the right bed after all. The other one by the door is also right by where they put the empty garbage cans and a noisy garbage truck works near there. The doctor comes over and does a test and says she has traces of board and other elements that indicate she has taken drugs. Board is a material that is in some drug as a filler. So now we can take her home. I sit her up in a chair ready to carry her home and I say to her, "You better listen girl, the third times the charm. You do this another time and you will not be rescued. We won't do it again. You will have to suffer the consequences. We mean it, too." (227 words)

A man and I are trying not to get caught in the spell of the aliens. I have hidden something important, maybe the essence of me, in a tiny, miniature doll I keep in a small case with other miniature dolls. They are searching everywhere for this little doll. I must not let them be aware I know where the essence is or that I am aware they want it from me, pretend I don't know nothing. I had put the doll in a safe place. One of them had come into my room and was spraying the walls with a shower nozzle spray thing. I demanded they stop that, I know they are searching for the doll. They leave the room. Now one of them, sort of like a gay man, gets suspicious I'm not under their spell. He bites me on the neck, or something like that. Now I pretend to follow him around. I sit down He leans over me from behind me, so his hands are on my thighs and his skinny, naked chest is right by my mouth. This is supposed to heat me up sexually and I'm a slave for his touches. I do get sexually excited and suck on his nipples and arch my back to get orgasm. Inside, I shrug to myself. This will throw them off track. They are very suspicious of me. (232 words)

I am a young woman who lives in a huge family. It is so big there are no places in the house where you can be alone. The couch is overrun with squabbling siblings of all ages. I want to go to the bathroom and must rush in and try to lock the doors before I'm interrupted by other siblings. This is driving me crazy. Finally I can't take it any more and I decide to run away from home. I hit out at some of the fighting kids on the couch as I pass them as I head for the front door. I get on my bike and go. Now I'm on a road, gravely, and following a huge truck. Now we are in a tunnel and it is dark and fearsome. I hope I don't get killed. I make it through to the other side. It's a town. I have the feeling the time period of this dream is older and maybe in Ireland. I want to find a place to live, an apartment, but of course I have no money. The shops are like in an indoor mall. I go to the bad part of town and see a carnival-like thing and wonder if I'll resort to taking a degrading job just to earn money for survival. But I pass the temptation of being a come-on girl for a booth and go to a counter where they do movies and ask the girl/woman there if they have any jobs. She laughs and says, "This is a very specialized job." I don't have the skills or training. I say, "I know," and ask her again if I can have a job. (283 words)

Murphy Brown and the crew are staying at a motel they have rented to do a show. In the garage are four white cars, very spendy and pretty. The show is over and Murphy wants to drive one of the cars. Miles pretends great fear that something will go wrong and says no. Murphy says, "Yes, let's do it." She gets in one car. He gets in the passenger side. She somehow manages to get it out of the garage by driving between the other cars; it's a tight fit. Now she's driving. She puts her arm across the seat and looks out the back window and jokes about how there is no long back end (like my van). Now she's driving fast down the road and Miles is nervous, "Don't go so fast, be careful. She says, "Let's see how fast this thing goes. She speeds up. She says, "I'm only doing 40, and Miles says, "But it's a 300 mile zone." She sees a car ahead and hits the brakes, a fender bender. They stop. A tiny bit of red paint from their car is on our car. He gets out and tries to make it seem it is a dent and much worse than it is. (209 words)

Murphy Brown and the gang are staying at a motel. They're up early for breakfast, eat a lot and then go back to bed, but our room is the passage the employees use to get to their jobs in the restaurant. And now they are up and coming through, so we get up again and have another breakfast. I gorge myself. Jim Dial sings a cute song to Frank, then a sweet love song to me. He shyly reaches out to hold my hand, but doesn't finish the gesture because he doesn't know how to react to my deformed hand. I hold it out for him to hold and he does so. The audience watches, enjoying the scene. Then he sings a magnificent opera to a large woman on my left. The audience agrees it's his best song. He leaves, with a little self-satisfied grin on his face. Now Corky and I and another woman are going to lie down and nap, but hey, we're on vacation, what is there to do round this seaside resort? We are restless, wanting to do it all. (184 words)

My parents are moving five miles east of A City, near M City in L City. I think maybe I might move there, but then I remember it's a smaller town and only one main street. I'd not be as entertained there as I am in E City downtown, with places to be. But it might be nice to go back, revisit the emotions that town brings to me. So I'm going to help them move, I think. I get in the car, which is a VW bus. My father says, "You sure drive that well." I say, "I learned how to drive on one of these." Now Rochelle is driving and we are going up the coast. The ocean is on the left. We are going to M City to visit. A TV crew is preparing to tape something. A man crew member does two jobs. He is right now creeping up to something with a cardboard he sometimes wears like a disguise or a sign, with a hole cut out for his face. Now we are still driving. A young girl is concerned, a man is like a lawyer or judge and they are trying to determine if the girl has been sexually abused. The man says, "Maybe she hasn't, and just thinks she has." Now I have a "memory flash" A hand is beckoning me from an attic room. I am maybe 5 or 6 years old and my family is temporarily living with another family, a black family, and everyone is gone for now. I go up the stairs to this attic room and the man is smiling and says, "Come on in, let me show you around." I go in and there is a couch, bed thing and he lays me on that and talks dirty and plays with himself. His wife comes in and talks, like nothing much is going on. Maybe it wasn't so awful, then. Then I feel sexual excitement and masturbate to orgasm, feeling a little guilty that I should enjoy such stuff. (342 words)

I am a woman who lives on a piece of land that has a mountain of trees from the back door on and a central (state) rocky terrain from the front door. I am garrulous and talking to a woman friend. Some men come to the door and I let them in and I'm telling my woman friend how we get our food here, that we won't go hungry because I grow pumpkins in the back. In fact, I'll be serving my men guests pumpkin pie for dinner tonight. I walk to the front door and look out and up. I see a square hole being sawed out of the blue sky and four men in blue shirts fall out of the hole like they'd been kicked out of heaven. They fall across the sky, rather than down, toward earth. There are four holes or so. I marvel that they start healing themselves up and soon there are no holes in the sky. I go back in explaining about what I saw to my friend. I carry a one-dollar bill in my hand and a shirt. I wear a black crocheted shawl over my T-shirt and jeans. I have ample bosoms. I'm going to give this one-dollar to the young man who has come to visit. I try to find a place to put the dollar so no one will see it and get tempted to steal it. First I lay it under a backpack on a shelf, then I tuck it into my jeans pocket. I say to the woman, "They had blue shirts on too. I guess when you are drummed out of heaven, they don't take your blue shirt from you too." I laugh. (287 words)

I give back the car keys to my boyfriend, who isn't treating me well. He's like Ted Danson on Cheers, a womanizer. I feel some regret because now I don't have a car and will have to figure out how to get around on my own. Now his other girlfriend needs to tell him goodbye and I am encouraging her to have the courage. She struggles and hesitates. I whisper, "Come on girl, come on. You can do it." Finally she does. She tells him it's over. Now I have to lead some group in a discussion of feelings. Two men have trouble. One is trying to share his feelings and another man is belligerent and noisy and interrupts him and they get into a verbal fight. Finally I say, "That's enough, you, leave." The man defies me and then finally leaves. Then they all leave. Now I am left with cleaning up and shutting the place up myself and I hadn't done that before. I don't know how to turn down the damper on the stove to get the fire to go out and be safe. I feel overwhelmed and frustrated and a bit of a failure for not managing to keep the group together.

I'm at a class and the man teacher is drawing things on the board. I am amazed that in just a swipe of the chalk, he can draw quite complex pictures with perspective. I say, "Does everyone but me draw good?" Then I go closer and see that the complex pictures are already on the board and when he swipes the chalk over it, it raises the picture up so we can see it. I say, "Oh, so that's how you do it." He shushes me; he doesn't want the others to know. Then I put a pink baby bonnet I made on his head, as a joke, and giggle at how silly he looks. Then it's graduation time and I receive some plants and some cats as gifts, a black cat and an orange one. The plant looks like a bird of paradise plant. It needs to be transplanted to do well. Now a fat woman named Velma (from high school) says she's getting married right now. She wears a pretty pink night gown and I go get the baby bonnet made and give it too her to wear as her veil. I give her the orange cat back. I carry it to the car. Her husband gets in, she gets in and I hand her the cat. They drive away. I go in to transplant my plants and take care of my black cat.

I am preparing to write a play or something and the deadline is approaching. I am procrastinating. I sit at a table and Arthur sits on my left. I am at the head or end of the table. I am talking with him and pat his hand and he reaches and keeps hold of my hand in an affectionate gesture. I am surprised. This isn't usual for him to be demonstrative. It's a convenient part of the procrastination, but now it's nearly time to be on stage and I quickly come up with an outline. We get on stage and I look around at the few props and so on and we begin improving dialogue. Then I realize we are on the wrong stage. This is the backstage, behind the one where the audience is waiting. I can hear them. A crewman comes and I say, "How do we get up on that stage?" I see a crawl hole I might have to climb up, a tight fit and a tough climb. Then he helps me and I tell him go get the props and be sure to bring my power wheelchair. I'll use it in part of the play. Now I am seated in the wheelchair. I hold a microphone in my right hand, and light a cigarette (for the part), kind of surprised I allow myself to smoke. I kind of enjoy doing it again. My chair gets a bit caught up in the fringe of the curtain and I struggle with the mike cord, but get on stage and begin the play. I circle around the stage examining where the props are so I know what I have to work with. I see two pianos, and one has ink pens on it for the survey bit and another has matchbooks on it. I notice that the grand piano can't be played from the position it is in and decide it doesn't matter. A woman comes in and she sits and gets a massage. I create dialogue with her as we go. I say, "Are you here for a nice massage?" She says, "Yes." I suggest after the massage, she start filling out the survey (seeing as that's the structure of the play, that survey about relationships). We doing OK when I realize the audience is far away; there are not very many of them. I see a row in the front of seven or eight women and then lots of empty seats and some more people scattered in the back. The curtain isn't fully open and blocks us from the audience view. I wheel over to where the curtain is partly open, more at the center of the stage, and send my dialogue at them, but must return to the side of the stage where we are doing the play. It is uncomfortable, not working well. (479 words)

I am a teen boy and I go into my house and steal things from my mother. She comes in the back door and I go out the front door. She yells at me and starts chasing after me. I run and get on a truck, hitchhiking. Now I charm all the young ladies and use them and then throw them away. Each girl is represented by a short box of Kleenex. When the box is empty, I sweep it out in a sweeper that is the same shape as the box, one after another. They cry and beg, but I love them and leave them. I am in a car, in the trunk now, and see I'm in central (state). I get out and wander around. I walk down a road and see berry pickers and listen in to their inane conversations as they talk to each other to pass the time as they work. Then I see I am in town and see a beautiful teen girl, a perfect cheerleader type. I want her and begin to lean on walls and smile and flirt. She looks directly at me, so that for a moment, I am her. She ignores him and is also very aware of him. She walks on down the street and he follows her everywhere. She goes into a cafe. He does too. She is eating. He says he wants her napkin. He gets up, in a flirty move, and takes her napkin, dips it in another boy's glass of water, flirting with him simultaneously and then hands the napkin to the bad boy. Now the bad boy is challenging her to a hot dog eating contest. He says three, she says no, just two. He insists. They argue the numbers back and forth. Then suddenly she falls to the ground and lies there in a trance. He gets up and looks. She has a cross-eyed mad woman look on her face and a message is written across this "picture." It says "Mad Dog Alison, brutally beaten." It was like she had another dark personality under her beautiful one because she's been abused. (358 words)

He then decides to keep the CD disk thing. Why destroy all that power even if it could be dangerous in the wrong hands? The flames are starting too get big so he starts to leave, then noticing that the oven is on and the roast is now cooked well done.

I decide to go out and get a newspaper. I decide to go in a different direction than I usually do. I discover the usual way up the sidewalk has been "improved" and is now more difficult for me to traverse. It is like a ladder made of cubicles, and inside the cubicles (boxes) are bricks put in a pattern that makes a toe hold difficult for me. I struggle up each one, hanging on hard, hoping I can make it. I get to the top and crawl over the top. A man stands there wondering if he should offer help. I say, "Help me," holding out an arm. He does. I go down a street and see a store and go in to get my newspaper. I see the president is there at a conference, perhaps in the basement, and then I am now in a skimpy outfit where all the women are being fitted for these form-fitting halter top-like things. A woman stands right behind me saying she can see I'm being fitted, so she'll follow me so she can get fitted. I am annoyed and say I am not being fitted. Each halter top is alike, a white square top with straps that force the boobs up prettily. Some women's boobs sort of drop under the wire cup outfit a bit. I decide since the president is here, I'd might as well take advantage of this and go complain about these changes in the sidewalk that now make it harder for me to get around. I go down and find both Bush and Clinton there. I walk up to Clinton and say, "Although I have to blame Bush, as it was his administration that made the plans, it is you that has to change it back. We have to be more aware of the environment and how it affects the disabled." He looks annoyed and I say, "I know it costs money and is unpopular, but it has to be done if any change will happen." As I continue talking, I am now talking to a president who is a woman. She hands me something, a lacy cloth "paper." Another woman sits on the couch and says to her, "Well, you sure have pretty feminine paper here." The president says, "I get a lot of teasing. The men don't like it; it will take some time for them to get used to this change. I notice my lacy panties are down around my ankles and I start to struggle, pulling them up. A man is seated across from us and he is trying not to stare. I am trying to be subtle, but in fact I am standing there hiking up my panties. I get it almost up and give up in frustration, sitting down with them uncomfortably wrinkled up almost at my hips. The woman says to the president, "Well, you sure can tell you used to teach the third grade and not..." (and she named some male traditional occupation.) (504 words)

I am in a house and two young married couples are there kissing and hugging and I feel like a fifth wheel. I smile indulgently remembering there are lots of bedrooms here and stroll on out to have breakfast. I go outside and see Charla. I am dancing in an exercise kind of way. There is lots of good energy; it's time to move again. I pick up my mail and open an ad for the new Mobil station, which has just been remodeled and open for business. Charla says, "What did I get?" and I say, "This is just an ad. Let's go get breakfast." She picks up a glass of milk from a table in a cafe where people are seated and drinks. We smile and go on to fix breakfast. (133 words)

I am at a sort of hotel, but it's where my family lives. The relatives are coming over. I offer them juices to drink. I say, "Orange? cranberry? grape?" They don't like the cranberry suggestion. I go into my mother's room to find the juices to make (frozen juices). I am also looking for the script of American Woman because I want to share that with my relatives. They weren't at the reading last night. I can only find the first few pages and the end page. I remember I have the video and can show them that. I say to Patricia, "Don't worry. We'll set it up in two different rooms so only those that want to see it will; the rest we can entertain in other ways." I am going to go down the stairs and see an elevator and then see a glass French door to another area of the hotel. I realize I want to go there and see what that part is like. I go in and see I am standing on a sort of balcony looking down over a huge, beautiful room that has a waterfall where the huge fireplace area would be. The sound is beautiful. I feel the balcony area wobble and shake. I lay down on the floor to balance it. I feel it is important to be there and balance, listening to the beauty of the waterfall. I return to the main room and see a cousin, male. I say to him, "I want to share with you this special place I found." He is spiritual and agrees. I see another male and invite him to join us. I say, "I forgot your name; no, I remember, it is Erik Erickson." They have both written books about their particular New Age spiritual feelings, and are open to the wonders I want to show them; or at least they wouldn't laugh at me. They agree to come with me to the balcony in the other room to look at the waterfall. Other relatives wander around, Aunt Naomi, cousin Patricia, cousin Lenny. They do not understand. I know that and it is all right. I'm not asking them to join or to understand. (371 words)

A group of people are waiting to use a public restroom. I am inside and point out to someone that there are two stalls that flush, one in a stall for privacy, the other just out there in the room. I say we could save time if we used both. Someone sits on the private one and farts and makes noises loudly as a statement about how they feel about doing this publicly. I grimace and smile; it is expected they would do this childish thing, and it is kind of funny. I go out to the group and tell them that we do have two stalls and it is their choice if they feel they can handle the embarrassment to use the open one. We'll get done faster that way. (131 words)

I work for a radio station and am very well endowed in the breasts. I wear a shapeless sweatshirt to cover me up so men won't stare. They are going to a company party thing at the ""farm." I go inside and then overhear a conversation the men are having about me. One says, "I don't know if she's with us or not." I can't tell if there is a commitment. She seems to not care one way or the other. I realize this is so, and go to a closet and choose a pretty jacket to wear to the party. Now I look very good and I go out there to join them but all the men stare at my breasts and it makes me very uncomfortable. I get on the piece of shingled roof we are going to fly on with the man, who is like the WKPR radio salesman, a sleaze ball. I tell Charla to sit nearer me and not so close to the edge. We start to fly. It is precarious and I nearly fall off several times. We arrive at the farm and I see the cows, one a scrawny tough old male. I say, "I hope I don't meet up with him." We go on to the house. (215 words)

I am lying on a couch, dead like. I look around the room and see it is still exactly like the moment the accident happened that killed me. A plant like my angel wing begonia lies in pieces on the floor where it was knocked over. A woman picks it up and brings the stem and leaves to me and says, "Look. Part of this is still alive. But it is without care and water for so long, but if you take care of it, it will live again." I am saddened and amazed that this could be revived. I sit up, now realizing I too am alive. My parents (sort of like Grandma Mildred and Grandpa Lloyd) are in the room and I get up and walk to them. They are shocked and happy to see I am alive. I go to Grandpa "dad" and he is seated in an easy chair, and I say to him, "Don't ever do this again. You left me for dead." He apologizes and his eyes are sad as he realizes what he did. I go back and sit on the couch and look out the window. High up on the hill is a new building, the new schoolhouse. My friends are there. I wave at them and my best friend sees me and they all run down to see me, so glad I am alive again. They swarm into the house. I am excited to see them. A man is there, a boyfriend of my friend, or my boyfriend. We all hug in reunion. I go out with them to get on the bus. [BL] (272 words)

I am told by Bonnie that there is a possible scholarship coming up that I can apply for. I go to the meeting and stand up to present my case. I can't seem to get around several black women of the committee who will make the judgment. I need to get up to the front of the stage so I can give a clear plea for my case. I finally just squeeze around them and feel like I'm being rude by standing in front of them, but I do it. Maya Angelou is in the audience and is on the committee that will make the decision. I tell them I write. "I am a freelance writer. I write poetry, plays, screenplays, and novels as well as other things, and I could use the 200 dollar grant or scholarship." I ask someone if it should be called a grant or a scholarship. They say, "Scholarship." My friend Bonnie, who is also on the committee, comes up, looking unhappy and sad. She says, "I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that I can't vote for you, and the others shouldn't as well because I had forgotten the rules. You would have to publish five things in five years and I don't think that is possible." She walks away, upset she had to do that to her friend. The women go away, believing her. I am hurt and angry. I go looking for Bonnie. I am in the old M City kitchen and I hear Mateo calling me from the bathroom. He comes out and says, "Hi," and talks in a friendly way. I say I like his longer hair style. I go out, calling Bonnie. She comes to me and I say, "I can't believe you did that." She says, "I'm sorry, I had forgotten the stipulations and I had to do that." She is torn between two loyalties, me, her friend and they, her community. I start to gather up my audio tapes I'd used as evidence of my work and accidentally pick up some others and put them back. They have sticker labels on them with their names on it and I wonder if I bothered to label mine with my name. I ask where Maya Angelou is. I really wanted to talk to her and meet her. Bonnie says, "She's tired and busy and has gone on." I am disappointed. Bonnie then goes to do other things and I call after her. "I can't believe you didn't have enough faith in me and my work that you believe I can't be published five times in five years. If I can't do that, I shouldn't even be writing." I repeat that. "I shouldn't even be writing if that were true. The only reason I haven't done it so far is that I haven't been marketing and sending my work out. I'd do that." She looks at me and turns to go talk to the black woman on the committee to rescind her statement. I wait. (506 words)

I am somewhere, a house, perhaps. Dovre is there. A small third grade girl is there, maybe Paulina, and Ginny and cousin Abner. I am busy doing something, maybe trying to clean up. Xmas presents are in a pile and cousin Abner says one is on the floor and Paulina says, "Is it the ceramic cat?" I smile at her naive way she gave away the info of her gift to me. I say, "I don't know, I'll have to wait until Xmas and see. Paulina is making something and I say, "Hey, you're pretty good at arts and crafts." She smiles and suggests she use my Lessons 9 and 10. I smile at her clever way to get my arts and crafts stuff to use. I say, "We'll do something together later. Then I see Dovre is in a small room and blowing up a square plastic thing and I say, "What's that, a square globe of the world?" she shakes her head no. I say, "Then what?" She pulls out a handle on the side and puts it at her feet. "Oh, a hassock, I say, "are you opening your Xmas gifts early?" I ask. She shrugs and agrees. I say, "It's your gifts, but I sure wish you'd wait." She seems depressed and I say, "There are other ways you can beat this depression than opening your gifts early and being disappointed in them." I smile at her, implying that I as a counselor can give her good ways to lick the depression. Then I see a white cat, scrawny and ill, crawl up and lay down near me. Its left paw is unusual, almost like a cross between a hand and a turkey claw (or chicken claw). I say, "Hey, I think it's sick." I say to Paulina, "Let's get it some food." Abner comes by and I say, "We'll give it some food and send it on its way," knowing it'll probably stick near us if we feed it. (334 words)

A young boy around 8 years old is in an orphanage. The head mistress doesn't like him and picks on him. Now he is 14 and has given birth to a baby. No one knows who the woman was, or maybe she gave birth but he has the baby, I'm not sure. Anyway, here comes the dark-haired, fierce, stone-faced head mistress looking for him. He hides with the baby in a box in the closet, covering them up with clothes. She is suspicious and sniffs around very close. A sheriff is called in and he and his men are around looking too. The boy calls out for help from his peers. They decide to create a diversionary tactic so he can escape. The boy comes out of hiding and runs. He calls the head mistress a lesbian. Her face goes red. She is livid with anger at this accusation. It is unclear if she's angry at a false accusation, or if she is feeling caught and embarrassed. She clearly is angry. He runs and then stops long enough to pick up a small box which has a tiny woman in it. The woman is a teacher at the orphanage and is the mother of the baby. She seduced the boy and he kept it secret to protect her. He says goodbye to her and goes off. Now time has passed and he's a grown man in his own home. He works hard and has a nice home, but he loves to iron clothes because it feels satisfying to get out the wrinkles. He does this when he wants to feel relaxed and happy. The sheriff returns to question him about the origins of the baby. He calls to a man, a gay man, to come and tell the sheriff they were together that evening to help with an alibi. The man hesitates and then agrees. Someone tells the young man he acts like a woman and prefers to be like a woman, by that I mean not physically, just in the things he likes to do, like cook and clean and raise the baby and so on.

I see the form has four parts with a question and a long blank space to answer in. I lay out the four pages so I can see them all in a row so I can make sense of them better. I partially copy her sentences and rewrite it with my own ideas. and words. (79 words)

I am at a bar and am attracted to this man. He asks me to dance, and it seems promising. I have some concern that he is just a jerk and I don't see it. I go into the restroom to ask my girlfriend who has dated him what she thinks. She says he's not perfect and has his faults, but he's OK. I decide to take him home with me and see what happens. I am attracted and he to me. Then for some reason, I am supposed to have the hair on my legs permanently removed. I am in a hospital-like room and the nurse has me lie down on my tummy on some surface like an ironing board. I ask, "Will it hurt?" The nurse laughs and says, "Of course it will." I tense up and flinch every time I think they are going to start. The nurse says, "We have to take you to the other place." I get on a bus. We drive and the bus stops, parked. The bus driver gets out, then the bus starts back up. I say, "Are we moving?" and look out the window. We are slowly moving and the speed is increasing. People start to get upset. Another woman gets up to go to the seat to try and stop the bus. I push her aside and do it myself. I say, "I can do it." I steer and push on the brakes, and get us back to our parking space safely, carefully trying to avoid running over the tea cups sitting all over the area. Now we go inside, a woman "witch doctor" type takes me into a room, a round room with lots of windows. My man friend is there. She hypnotizes me and I float up and smile pleasantly at the man. She says, "I'll try it now and see if she feels it." She does my legs and I feel no pain. Now it's the next day and I see strange men in a line outside the window. It's flashbacks from the trance. Two men come in, a short one and a tall one. I ask for their names. The short one says his name. I say, "Did you say your name was Violent?" He says, "No, I said my name was Violet." "Oh, that's better," I say. Now I am home and doing dishes and thinking about that nice man I danced with. He comes in the door and we smile. We dance and kiss; it's very pleasant. (424 words)

I am in a town and walking down a sidewalk. Charla is in a box, a cardboard box, and playing. I pick up the box and am carrying her home (feels a bit like M City). We pass a group of her first grade class doing some summer time activity, like a class picture. She decides now she wants to join them. I say, "Too late. You could have joined them before, but you chose to play around." Charla cries and I resolve to continue, to be consistent. I say to the group as we pass, "Sorry." The teacher understands. As we continue on, I realize Charla will be missing lots of fun and I circle around and ask the teacher if it's too late for Charla to join them. She says it's fine. I lecture Charla (an empty swim suit) about next time, I won't give in, if she dawdles and plays around, then I will follow through and take her home. She gleefully runs off to play with them.

A woman asks another woman to take professional photos of her as she writhes around on the floor. She is sheepish and semi-apologizes for taking advantage of the moment to get her work done (the work of selling her product, namely herself). The woman with the 35 millimeter camera shrugs; she's not too happy about this, but acquiesces. I happen to have my camera and also take pictures. We are snapping fast as the woman poses and smiles sexy and twists and looks cute, and changes and looks pouty, etc. She has whips or seaweed things she twists around with and I think that a bit strange, but she must have meant that to happen, as she doesn't seem the type to leave things to chance and probably planned it this way. One shot is her on her tummy with her hands behind her back with the whip-like things around her, like a bondage thing. Then her show business partner, another woman, enters and they want pictures of them both. I agree and they choose to sit on a flower print couch. "How's this?" they ask. I say, "No, it would be better on the other couch, the yellow one, the print is too busy." Now my mother is sitting on the flowered couch and asks, testily, if she should get up and out of the way. I say, "It's not you, it's the couch." So we move the flowered couch and replace it with the yellow love seat. There is a lace curtain (like in my apartment) behind it. I snap some shots and see, to my delight, that behind the lace curtain is an ocean with girl children playing in it and the photos are now superimposed shots of the two women's heads surrounded with these laughing, playful girls. I take a number of shots because it is so pretty and nice. Then I stop and say to the women, "I need to tell you what I see here, because I guess that's not what you really want for your professional photos." I describe what I had seen. (350 words)

A group of women meet every Friday. It's a neat group, interesting, creative. Mabel is one of them. I bring a young woman in a manual wheelchair to be included in the group. I am impressed with her. She is intelligent, humane and creative. I had not asked them ahead of time, so she is with me at the meeting where I ask them to include her. The group seems unsure and resistant. Mabel suggests she go and join her own kind of group (disabled). I fire up in defense and point put how she is intelligent and so on and would be an asset to this group. Mabel asks me "Is she a lesbian?" I am surprised at the question and then ponder. I answer, "I don't know. I don't think so. She doesn't look or act like one." (140 words)

I am late for class and am rushing. Another woman is with me. We have a very fat, little obnoxious boy with us who we have to take care of. We decide to take him to the school daycare center. We know we'll meet resistance. The two women see us coming. "I suppose you will tell us this is our fault, that we forgot the phone call you made to reserve his space." I say honestly, "No, we didn't call. We need your help." They refuse us, no room. I turn to the other woman, whose responsibility this really is and say, "I'm sorry, but I must leave this to you and go on to my class." I feel bad, but I must do it. I resolutely do so, handing her this fat boy (maybe 2 years old) even though I feel guilty. I leave her and get to the class. The time has been changed and 1:50 time shows on the clock. The room is already full. I put my classwork, which I am excited about and feel is good work, down in a small spot and stand. There is no place to sit. The instructor (male) comes over to see my work. (204 words)

I am male and swimming in the ocean in front of a huge boat. In order to not be run over, I grab the chain and pull myself on board, only to discover it is a sort of prison ship.

I am having a quarrel with someone. I decide to leave and walk. A fat, kind man like John Goodman says he'll drive me. I am angry and say, "No way, I'll walk." He says, "I can't let you do that." He's very big brother or protective. I walk, so he walks behind me. I turn and yell at him to leave me alone. I turn back and continue walking, but I can't help a tight smile because he's being so sweet. We walk in single file and now a large mosquito, only it's really a slim woman, tries to attack me. As long as I create a breeze with this card in my hand by waving it around, she stays just out of reach. She's persistent and I must constantly defend myself. I do so. She waits for me to tire out. Then John warns me a black fly is near. I get under the covers and cover everything around my face. Some other woman wasn't very protective and leaves me vulnerable to the fly attack (maybe my mother). John goes to get some rest. I continue to fend off the mosquito woman. I am tiring and she knows it. I am fencing with her with my blue card and once I move too slow and the card touches her for a moment and she smiles and says, "I have you now. Next time, you'll stick and then I can move in on you." I valiantly fight, but it's harder and harder. Now I have an electric fan that works and then a bigger one that doesn't work. The air stream goes too slow and in the wrong directions. I call to John to come help me. He does, then we continue on our journey. We come to a woman's house and she says we can work for her if we'd watch the Raiders (sports team). I say, "OK, sure," secretly so happy because we always love to watch the Raiders. John and another thin man step back and do a huge happy gesture, kissing the carpeted stairs. I smile at their cute antics and their happiness. We go in. The mosquito seems to be gone now.

I am getting ready to go on a business trip to another community college. I remember I should go sign out so the woman in charge will know where I am. I go to the sign up sheet. I sign my name B and write the name of my town. Then I remember it is a different town. I have some difficulty writing things down correctly. Charlene (the personal attendant) says I should have written my name up in this special place, not in the list with everyone else. I shrug and leave it as it is. Then I see Bill Cosby playing good music on a saxophone. Then I and several others are going to get some food for dinner and breakfast. The young man with us, early 20's, gets a forklift-like thing and goes to a great deal of ornate movement to get the loaf of bread off the high shelf. The black janitor that I had asked to get the food watches, shaking his head. I hear music, loud and flamboyant orchestra music, very dramatic, then applause, like a recording of a concert and the audience applauding a great finale. I laugh at the pretentiousness of it all. He could have simply reached up and got the bread. I return to where Bill Cosby is and he is playing a very good sax. I admire him and am wishful I could play for him and maybe he'd see I have talent. I go on, but instead of just walking down the sidewalk, I tap dance. A woman, perhaps Charlene, watches me, admiring my steps. I get to the corner, where my boyfriend waits for me. He and the young man are playing a dice game and I tap dance around the dice. My boyfriend disapproves and asks me to not do that (dance). I am angry, but don't say anything. The young man tells me if I keep it in, I could get ill. I say. I could have just stomped on his dice, but I didn't. I think I tell the boyfriend off and to not tell me what to do. If I want to dance, I will. (362 words)

There are three of us, males. We are planning to take some people, perhaps ourselves, and cook them down to a sauce and drink it. I have reservations. I ask, "Isn't this like cannibalism? Eating people isn't right." They assure me it's OK, because it's us, not anyone else. I am not totally convinced. I go along. We put a small person in a pot and cook it down. The sauce is blood red. He gets it out and offers it to me. I cringe and say, "I can't." I see two cockroaches in it, and exclaim, "How did they get in there and they are still alive?" Then the man eats the living cockroach and swallows a few bites of the stuff, which is now thin white thread-like things. I feel queasy and walk away back to our rooms. Slowly, the man starts turning into an insect man. He is coming for me and I run away, trying to get away. I go outside and mingle with bikers and sleazy people. The insect man now has extra feet and legs and is on a bicycle and the extra legs are now a circle of legs and feet and an extra wheel and pedals on the bike. I see some other half and half creatures around, a man's head on a short zebra-like body. Others have sipped the sauce. I run; they chase. (233 words)

I have failed and I shrug and say, "Oh well, you'll just have to figure it out yourself then." (94 words)

A married couple. The woman is a doctor and I tell her I'm glad she's going to do the blood work on me. I can get sed rates from my regular doctor, but he doesn't do the RA (RH?) factor and he doesn't do a chemistry scan for what nutrients my body handles well and which ones it doesn't use well, so I'll know what to eat to be healthier. I am visiting their home. There are three men: one the husband, one his good friend and another friend who is visiting at the same time I am a Vietnam vet who is crazy. The woman wants to know if I've seen the meadow yet. I say, "I don't think so. I've been out to the pasture when we rode horses, and you showed me the side yard." I look out and see a garden, isn't it? I see cabbages and lettuce. Then I see something beyond it which is ugly and not kept up. "I don't know what that is," I say. She'd really like me to see the meadow, it's so pretty and quiet and restful. Now I am getting into a small car-like vehicle, like a bumper car or sports car, convertible. I am going to drive it on the sandy course built for this. People are concerned. I might crash. I take the challenge in stride. I speed up for the corner and the audience gasps. I feel very confident and free. I can do this well and enjoy doing it. I swirl around and around, spraying up sand and racing over bumps and hills that everyone thinks will tip me over. I do it all well and come to a spectacular finish and the audience applause is stupendous. They are thrilled and give me an ovation. The husband comes to me and hugs me and we embrace lovingly. He says, "I love you. You've been living in my basement and growing and growing and I'll always love you, but I love my wife and she's pregnant and growing in that way, but it's not the same. I love you." I say I love him. He says, "But you're not a romantic, right?" meaning I'll love him and accept the fact that he will remain with his wife. I agree. He's not happy with her, but he is committed to her and will stay. His good friend wants to hug me too, but is blocked by the husband and my mutual love. He stands behind the husband trying to enfold us both in the hug, because that's the only way he can get to me. Later, as he and I are talking, he says, "We did pretty well when the Vietnam vet came to visit for three days. We all managed. it was hard, but we did it well. We can do it again, now." (479 words)

Jake is being very sweet and communicative. He tells me he sent my father a Valentine's card and letter because we don't appreciate him enough. He is curling my hair for me. He is painstakingly putting it up on tiny screws. Dwight is there somewhere, watching. I am trying to figure out how to talk to him about his upcoming divorce and reassure him that it's OK to talk about his feelings. He and I walk to a wall area, where we can talk alone, as he continues to put up my hair. I lean against the wall and think to myself, "Maybe this isn't such a good time to talk about this; he'll get angry and maybe pull my hair." Then he says, "You saw me at the beginning of the thing. So I was upset, but I'm fine now. Everything is just fine." I realize with a sinking heart, he's totally in denial. "Fine?" I ask incredulously. He reassures me emphatically, "Everything is fine." Then my father is in the room, walking with a small girl, maybe a cousin or grandchild. He is going toward the door to the next room and I look up and yell, "Look out," just as the door pops off its hinges and crashes down on him. It's made of glass. The top half is a pretty etched and frosted glass and the bottom half is a regular window glass. It breaks, and he stands up, trying to hop out of the door frame. He steps into the bottom half and breaks it. He says he's OK and I yell, "Check for cuts. Check for cuts." He looks himself over and there seems to be no damage. The little girl had scurried for another room and I went in there to see if she's all right. (303 words)

My brother Dwight and I are working in Dr. A's office doing odd jobs. I am attempting to do a graphics thing on a portable computer I borrowed from some woman. I can't get it to sit up right and she shows me. Dwight is in charge of taking care of Dr. A's cat. Dwight says, "Let's go to a movie." I say, "OK." Dr. A then comes in and suggests we go to a movie with him. He asks if Jake is responsible enough. I say, "Well, he is 20 years old." I then pause and remember, no, he's 40 years old. Dr. A is laying on the ground, sort of in a gutter- like thing in the room. He goes over to talk to Dwight. Dwight tells me that the cat he'd been taking care of died. I look out the window and see a tiger striped cat and say, "No, he's right out there in the garden." Dwight says, "That's a different cat." The cat turns and looks at me and I see the face is different. I give up working on the graphics thing, because I can't get the screen part to stand up at the right angle. I place a ruler under it to hold the angle, but it doesn't work. We go out with Dr. A. I whisper to Dwight, "Is it OK?" (meaning not to go to the movie he requested, but go to Dr. A's movie) He says, "It's OK." We go down the hall. I see a sign that says, "Negative Hypnotists" or something like that. I think this means this is where patients are taken when the prognosis is negative, to see how they will cope. We go in and I immediately realize this is a psychological testing area (not paper and pencil test, but experimental). The room is huge, long and narrow. A long, long table runs the length of the center of the room. I look around and see Dr. A has chosen a chair in the corner, facing the wall, with his back to us. I say, "Do you have to sit in the corner?" (a joke). He doesn't respond and I know that is because he must be a neutral observer and not influence me. I look around and see three or four tiny kindergarten chairs and the examiner seated in one of them. I choose my chair, across the table from him and Dwight sits on my right. Lots of people then enter the room, crazy or depressed or strange people. They wander around the room. I watch. Then a large, muscular, fat woman with short hair comes over really close to me and leans into me. I turn and say to her, "Get back from me." She is belligerent and leans even further into me and says, "Does this bother you?" I say, "Yes, it bothers me." I shove her away. She comes back. I say, "Barb, move back." I shove her again. She's hard to move, but I am strong and surer of myself. She repeats this a number of times and finally I manage to push her to the floor and she gets up and leaves. Now everyone leaves. I am alone in this huge room and the doors and windows are shut and bars slam down so it's very obvious I'm being locked in all alone. I feel confident. I know this is a test. I'm not concerned. I even smile a bit at the dramatic flair they do this with. I go to one window where the bars are coming down. They are wooden slats with pointed ends. These ones malfunction and kind of fall softly down and don't completely lock me in. I smirk. Then I walk the length of the room just looking around. As I approach two doors, I see they are partially open and then across the room a white wooden door is slammed shut like someone has just run through and left. I know it is unlocked and they expect me to be desperate and try the door to connect with someone, but I don't feel desperate or curious. I 'd rather explore the two open doors. I go to the first one and push it all the way open. The title of this room is "Fighting Woman" room. I go in and see feminist books and hear a recording of feminist books. It's a nice enough room. I go out. I've heard all this before and I go to the next room, the support room. It's a support group therapy room. A body is laying on the couch, covered by a blanket. He starts moving like he's waking up. I see another body on the floor, perpendicular to the couch, her head between the couch and the wall. She was sleeping and is waking up. I step over her to the door. I don't want to stay here and deal with them. It's boring. I am back out in the big room and see the door marked "employment" and feel some regret that it is locked, but I'm still in that secure, confident place, knowing this is just a test. (866 words)

Merle has a crush on me and draws porno pictures of me. Lucy and I are looking at them. I am impressed with how big my eyes are, and how pretty. Later, there is a girl named Lori and she is acting out or crying and I say to her, "This has got to stop or I'll call in the children services division." I know she's been abused, perhaps sexually, and maybe Merle and another man are doing it. I am going to report them. I want this abuse to stop. (91 words)

I am in Charla's kindergarten class. the teacher is looking around, and so am I, at the mess created by the children; things flung all over. Two bunny rabbits are hopping around underfoot. She asks the children to help clean up the mess and they aren't very interested. She starts to pick up things and gets the kids into their seats. I see some things still on the floor under the desks and get down and gather up plastic forks and straws. I arrange them on the side counter and then I am now putting silver forks in one dish, and spoons in another, and knives. Some are still wet from being washed. I put the odd-shaped serving utensils in a nice pattern and arrange a couple of pretty glass dishes in the center. Then, as the teacher is doing the lesson for the kids, I go to the back of the room and start arranging my stuff. I decide to take my things back to my room -- Evangeline hats, pretty sparkly jewelry. The teacher joins me as I am straightening things up and talks to me. I figure she gets lonely with only kids to talk to and lessons to do. She starts helping me put things on the dresser. This isn't what I wanted to do, but I let her. I have an owl and a pussy cat (two stuffed animals) and I point out that these three particular hats are Evangeline hats. Charla comes up just as I am pulling out a crumpled old Mexican straw hat out from behind the dresser. She starts pulling at it and wanting to take it and play. I say, "No, this isn't the time for that." She needs to be doing her lessons. She finally agrees and leaves me. The teacher is talking non-stop and I notice her nice teeth. She says, "We should do some of the lessons outside, it's so nice. Maybe you could a lesson on disability." I realize I have become like a mother's helper, teacher's aide for the class and wonder if that's what I want to do. (354 words)

I am the substitute driver for the LTD Bus System. I have a full bus, very crowded. I don't know the route, and follow from one bus stop sign to the next, hoping I'm doing it right. My brakes aren't working well and I have a very difficult time stopping the bus. I stand on the brakes. I decide to call for directions to know my route. I pick up the phone and meanwhile some women are crowded onto the first seat. There is standing room only on this bus and they are boisterous and pushing up against me. I demand they back off. They don't really listen. I notice I am trying to stop the bus and end up crunching a small tree, bending it over as I plow into it because my brakes are so slow to work. The woman on the phone doesn't give me good information about my route and doesn't help me with the noisy passengers. I am frustrated. (164 words)

I have a crazy mother and a rich, distant father who owns a business. I have a boyfriend who is a good-looking man physically, but not so smart; not stupid, just ordinary. I am laying on top of him, kissing him and enjoying the close physical connection. I say something like, "Too bad you're not as smart as me," and then feel embarrassed at the disclosure. I smile, caught, and confess. I say, "I guess I think my being so smart is something special" (not those words, but that feeling). He laughs at my silliness. He tells me my father gave him a job. I am glad. He's to be a waiter in the club. My crazy mother comes by and starts to be crazy and then remembers his name and behaves herself. I am impressed. She must really like him to have done that. (145 words)

I am a housewife and cleaning up the apartment. It is constant work and I do it willingly. I fold clothes, do the dishes, cook meals, and care for the small kittens. I pick it up and cuddle it saying in a soft sweet voice, "Oh, there's the little kitty." Later, I have children, two half-grown boys and a six-year-old girl. I then am lighting the candles and am dressed in a 1950's housewife, pretty for my hubby, and he walks in the door with an unexpected dinner guest. I am distressed, but handle it gently and with dignity. Later, I am cleaning up, he's now drunk and off to bed calling for me to come to bed and I am still cleaning up the sink from after the dinner. Woman's work is never done. [BL] (135 words)

I am writing a play for television and the woman actor says, "How come the beginning characters were not so good?" I point out that writing takes time to improve and evolve. The beginning of a series is not as finely tuned as later. She does a beginning scene which has since been changed and improved. I wince at its badness. Now a young man has a crush on me and follows me around. I am embarrassed. I am teaching a writing course and it is unethical for me to return any personal feelings to him. I am putting my long hair up on rollers. He watches and pleads with me to notice him. I try to ignore him, but it is hard. Then I notice another student, a new one, and feel embarrassed I had not paid attention to him before. I am worried he will have lost interest and pull away from the class. Then I would have done a bad job as a teacher. I talk with him, trying to assure him this isn't the way I usually teach class, but I got sidetracked. I have four or five curlers in and realize I have to take them out now and wonder if it was even worth the trouble putting them in because they need time to set the curl. (223 words)

I am trying to take a bath up on the mantle of the fireplace, in a tiny ceramic bowl, white. My feet barely fit in. It is slippery and small and I have nothing to hold on to. It is very difficult, dangerous and frustrating. A large mirror is on the wall facing me. I try hard but can't seem to stay balanced. In addition, people keep opening the door and walking in. I am naked and don't wish to be exposed like that to passersby in the hall. I ask them to shut and lock the door. Then I realize others have keys to the door, so they won't be stopped. I call out, "Help me, help me," as I hang by a rope, having slipped off the mantle. A man comes over and I get back on the mantle. He holds out his hand to steady me and I grasp it desperately. Then I let him help me off the mantle. I say sadly, with strong feeling, "I've never given up before." I am devastated and slip into a non-feeling, non-caring sort of trance or coma. He helps me to the next room, trying to encourage me to wake up. I do not respond. He brings in the straw or hay Xmas tree with gifts and messages from my aunts on it. I do not respond. "Mom" is looking through the hay for the broken set of keys to make sure none are lost, because I loved my car and when I wake, I'll want my keys. I see one small key has slipped deeper into the hay, and automatically start to reach out to point to it so she'll retrieve it, but remember I am in a coma and don't do it. I see what's around me but don't respond. I notice my aunts gave me pretty ornaments that are shaped like different kinds of shoes. They are pretty shoes, but why do they think I want shoes?

I am lying in bed and see a man I kind of am attracted to. I let him come to my bed to make love to me and suddenly realize it is Howard. I let him make love to me, but he ejaculates prematurely, I feel no sexual excitement. I am disgusted with him and he is ashamed. He apologizes and I shrug, barely politely accepting the apology. Now I am aware of his wife, who is jealous, and I spend some time in a crowd of people, trying to stay away from this man, now not Howard. He'd sit next to me and I'd look around to see where the wife was and then think up excuses to move away. Now it's time to go see my play. I am waiting for Corinne, who is going to go to the play with me; I have bought both our tickets. She's late. I look for Bonnie and Mateo, who end up not showing up. I decide to go in and leave Corinne's ticket at the box office in case she makes it. I am led in and I announce to the usher, "I am the playwright," so she'd give me the special seating. We go around to the side wings area so I'd see the play from the wings. The entire area is graveled and I notice there are no chairs for the audience. The usher, a woman, sets a chair for me and I tell her I need one for my friend, should she come. She gets it. Now the audience comes in and there are folding chairs set up. A large crowd is in the next room area and then just as the play is to start, they walk across the audience area, to leave. They are some other group. The video cameras and lights go with them. Now the play starts and it is a series of scenes involving kings, magicians and puppets. I am impressed with how well the actors are doing with only a few rehearsals. They are off book and have done some nice things with puppets to augment their small numbers. Some audience members chuckle at my humorous lines. It isn't an overwhelming success, but it is an OK play. The king announces, "I am the King," several times. I notice the actor who is about to enter and exit from my side of the wings is pulling the curtain closed so I won't be able to see. I say to him, "Psst. I am the playwright." He is annoyed, but complies and pushes the curtain open so I can see. He'd rather have closed it for the convenience of the actors and the production. (452 words)

I am in a room and Dora is exhausted. She's a housewife and mother and works from morning until night and never gets caught up on her rest. She is folding laundry and Aunt Esther or Aunt Charlotte is visiting. Aunt Charlotte is wearing a black print dress and Dora pulls out a white, pretty dress from the laundry basket and says she can wear this one if she stays overnight. Bonnie holds it up to herself. Her hair is dark black and she has a pale complexion, so the white of the dress isn't all that complementary to her. She'd rather wear the black print one again. Dora is folding up bras and is searching for one that is comfortable for Auntie. She looks at one that is counterbalanced and says, "Maybe this one will help." They are all quite large, like "D" cup size. Aunt Charlotte then starts twirling and dancing and singing like she's pretending to be on stage and I think, "She really does have talent. It's too bad she isn't doing anything with it." Dora then turns to me and says, "We'll have to figure out something about the throat" (I'd had a coughing thing when I was being visited by this man, maybe Dovre's young man, Dwight. I'd impressed him with my humor but I'd had a coughing thing where I had to excuse myself from the room to choke and cough. He thinks I'm pretty talented. It was too bad about the throat.)

I am about to be a part of a production, but I haven't been to any of the rehearsals; perhaps I'd been ill. I ask the large, overweight woman teacher where I should stand. The teacher, who looks a bit like Grandma Agnes, is busy and abrupt with me. I see the girls standing and practicing where they will be during one song. If I join them, I will have to know the precision turns and moves. If I don't join them, I'll be standing alone and conspicuous on the stage with nothing to do. I am aware that if I had taken the initiative and rehearsed, I'd not be in this predicament. I go in search of the teacher who is rehearsing a woman singing. I stand there, edging nearer to get her attention, which interrupts their rehearsal. I am envious of the woman's singing ability to do opera. My throat can't do that any more. The teacher is annoyed with me. She goes to the piano. I am crying copious tears that drip onto the piano. The teacher says, shortly, "Oh, for goodness sake, at least don't get tears on the piano!" She says I'll just have to figure it out, where I'll stand. She hasn't time to work with me. When I'd asked to be a part of this production, I'd promised I wouldn't be a trouble, but I sure am one now. I decide I have to go to the bathroom and find a stall, lock the door and am still crying. Girls look at me sympathetically, but I don't want them to fuss over me. (270 words)

I am cooking a great special dinner for a man I like. It's sort of a first date. He is very handsome and charming. I am putting things in the oven. He comes to the door and I invite him in. There is exciting tension and anticipation in the air. I set up a table in the other room, which also has a made up double bed with a blue bedspread on it. It's my roommate's room. I take out three pies from the oven and take them in to the table, with my oven mitts on. He is impressed; I am happy. I set the table, with his plate at one end and mine at the other and a third plate on the side between us. I realize I didn't give him the biggest baked potato as I had planned and exchange it. He demurs, but is pleased. He sits and I sit. He says, "This is too far away from you." He moves his plate to the side close to me. Now Ellie and "I" come in to visit and "she" pulls us aside to explain she wants a night alone with this man (she's now sort of like Judy P). We giggle and leave to go to our house. We walk across the unkempt, wild yard to our house. Our third roommate is watching TV and I tell her of the date. She recognizes the man and says, "He's not a doctor, he's an actor." I realize he's a fraud trying to con her. So we rush over and pound on the bedroom door and look in the window. It's too late, he's in bed, maybe they already had sex. We sneak around to where he's left his coat and bags. I search for his car keys. I find them and hurry to take his precious car for a ride to pay him back. He's coming toward me so I rush, I drive out and he chases me calling stop! Stop! I want the car to be a sporty car and have trouble getting it to appear so. I drive down a bumpy gravel road and see a road block up ahead. I slow down and the men working the construction let me through. I take a sharp hairpin curve up a side road up a hill, slowly. I go up to a promontory and peek over, watching for him. He arrives huffing and looking all around for me. He's very handsome. The men point to the road I took and he's running up the hill and I slowly drive down the road, luring him on. I know this switchback will take me almost back to the house, but he doesn't. He's lost and upset. This is a great joke. I feel very satisfied I've taught him a good lesson he'll never forget. I stop, get out with his flashlight and wait in a tree as he retrieves his car. He hesitates and calls out he'll give me a ride back, he doesn't feel right about leaving me alone in the woods, but I don't respond and he finally drives away. (524 words)

I am at a resort, looking out a window at the ocean far down below. I enjoyed watching the waves and marveled how high they could come up the cliffs and how they worked back toward the sea with such foamy power. I get up to pack, because it's time to go home. I have trouble gathering up all my stuff. Lucy is also packing and her things are mixed with mine. I hold up a blouse on a hanger which also has a small girl's dress on the hanger. It belongs to her. I am a bit frustrated because I don't really want to leave, and some men have sat at my good spot by the window so I can't watch the waves and Lucy's stuff keeps slowing me down. I get to the truck and discover lots of Lucy's stuff under it. I am annoyed. She asks me where her laundry basket is. I see a yellow plastic laundry basket by the wheel of the truck, and lots of clothes, papers, boxes of things. Now I see that the things on the truck are just laying around loose. I start to pack them into drawers in the dresser to keep them from flying away when we get going. A plastic package of honey is there and I wonder if I should put it in the drawer, because it could break and make a mess. (236 words)

It's time to go somewhere, but the bathtub had just been filled with warm, pleasant water. Oh well, we can use it later, only it won't be so warm then. The tea set is set up under the water already. Then Ginny throws herself into the tub and splashes around, showing me to spontaneously have fun. I smile and go out to tell people we'll be delayed for awhile because Ginny is bathing. I see a woman with long hair down to the floor and another woman cuts the length and it still touches the floor. The hair is luxurious, thick and silky. I admire it. I see my own hair and it sort of has some length to it, but it is thin and falls out easily. In fact, the hairdo is short now, not because I had a haircut, but because it falls out. (146 words)

Howard has a camera and a woman is trying to convince me to let bygones be bygones and take advantage of this and work with Howard because I need a camera. Howard stands on my left and I say what kind of camera? 16 MM? He grins and says bragging, "No, 32 mm." Whoa! A professional film camera. I am tempted, but really am disgusted with the idea that I'd have to work with him. Then I see a wee baby crawling on the grass and see her bottle next to her and say to her playfully, "Hey, you're too young to be smoking," calling the bottle a cigarette. The baby has no sense of humor and bursts into tears, crying. I pick her up to soothe her and as I am walking with her in my arms, over my shoulder, I feel how skinny and loose she is, not compacted like a healthy normal baby is, wobbly like a doll. I say, "Hey, we're going to have to make you plump." She bursts into wailing tears again. I pat her and say soothingly, "It's a good thing. You need some fat. It won't be too much." What a fussy, sensitive baby! Now I am arriving at the studio in Hollywood where I'll be learning how to make a movie, with Howard's camera and Howard in tow. I enter a big room with a bank of video machine like things I'll be learning to use. I walk the length, looking at the dazzling machine array. This is exciting and will be fun. I sit at a table with other interns or students. A man calls out "B." I say, "That's me." He says, "Can't be. He holds up a purse he found that belongs to a B, with a funny, artistic face etched or carved inside it. It doesn't belong to me. He's the teacher. I'm going to learn a lot here and have the advantage of my own camera. Lots of other students will not have the use of a camera and won't get their projects done for a long time. (352 words)

Dwight and I decide to go out after Grandpa Clyde and his friend to find out where they are fishing so we can watch. It's a secret fishing hole. I go back into the house to get my wheelchair and just then my mother is taking it apart to fix it. I say excitedly, "I need it now to go somewhere." She says, "Well, I just got started. You'll have to wait." I am frustrated but give up. Then my father is there and he says, "Well, sometimes Dwight would ride the riding lawn mower." I say, "Great, we'll use that." Now, my father is driving and I am sandwiched between him and Dwight, who sits behind me as I sit behind my father. We bounce and careen over the countryside. I am worried I'll get my feet caught in the wheels and maybe I'll fall off, but I hang on and we make it to where the river is, only we've lost their trail. Now, there are a series of dressing rooms. I peek in one and see a little bathroom next to the changing room. It is a high step up to two toilets. They are not accessible. I go back out and we wonder what to do next. My father sees a phone booth and we push the button to talk with the ranger. My father speaks, calling him Ricardo. The man says, "My name is Robin." My father explains, "We are looking for two men fishing and need to know an accessible way to the river and where they might fish." He calls him Ricardo again, which annoys the man so I take over and call him Robin, and ask again. He asks what kind of fish they were going for and my father says the name (it starts with a C). I don't tell the ranger the name, fearing it might be illegal to fish for those kind. Robin says he'll be there in a minute to help us out. (335 words)

I am back in the M City house and looking at the inside of the house, remembering fondly. I say this will be the second wedding from this house. I see the beautiful lace curtains and admire them. That's different than when I lived here. I think it is me getting married. I decide to step out on the side porch to look around. I haven't been here in a long time. I see it is a ramp now, not the steps, and it is all fixed up nicely with decorative porch lamps, all white and gold and pretty. Then I look out across Hembree Street and see a house that never was there before. I don't like that. Then it moves away, along with the other three houses, like it's a train of houses. After it is gone, I see a big vista like a golf course in its tidiness. I think, "Hey, where's the train trestle?" and then see it. I am relieved and then I see a creek going under it and across my lawn diagonally past the house. "My creek," I say nostalgically. Then I wonder what the back yard is like, and I look. Horrified, I see a road has cut through the canyon and a train track. I am very sad and sob uncontrollably at this loss. (223 words)

I write a bit for Mark H to do, about Christmas candies. I think it is a funny bit until I realize he won't have time to get it memorized. I think, "Well, then what would be so wrong if we did it as a staged reading, not an off book production?" I know this is a cop out. I should have prepared, Mark should have prepared. Now the candy skit doesn't look as funny and I pick up the packages of glittery sugary candy from the box and look at it again. (151 words)

H and I are talking. Merle has moved and is back visiting. He comes by. I am teaching something or examining something for work. It's time to quit work and go home. Merle joins us. He is talking. He is standing up and is very, very skinny, almost as thin as a pencil. He says to someone, "My wife and I..." and I turn and look at Hasani, wondering why she hadn't told me Merle was married now. Hasani looks like, "I was sworn to secrecy." I go over to talk to Merle. He says, "It was a marriage of convenience. It isn't really working out." He still likes me very much. He then hands me five blouses on a hangers and an old pair of printed pants of his. He tells me that this man wants me to put them on. I am to choose which blouse to wear. I pick one. Merle says, "The man says not that one. You can't wear it ever. It's just to be in the closet." I am a bit annoyed and choose to comply now, knowing that I will rebel later at his orders. He thinks he possesses me, but I don't agree. He's sort of like the crazy man in a previous dream. I put on the pants. It's like clown pants. They are so overly large for me. I cinch in the yellow belt farther and farther, until I feel quite slim in comparison to the pants. This pleases the man, who is watching. (254 words)

I am traveling on a mountain road and look out over the vista. I see cars going into two huge twin tunnels far off in the distance. I see a lake and beautiful mountains. I travel on with my group. Then we meet my cousin Abner on the road. I introduce him to a man in the group. Abner is uptight and unsure of himself and begins to shake and tremble. I remark that he has the "family" trait of fear around other people. He and I go off down the road without the group. We find ourselves in a deep hole with furniture in it. We climb up the huge dresser to the top of it and look out. We see lots of bunk beds in the woods, a camp of some kind. Abner jumps down to the ground and I am to follow, only it's a long jump and I am worried. He holds his arms out wide as if to catch me and grins. I then turn to go down; I hang on to the edge of the dresser top like I'm hanging off a cliff edge and then see handles and go down, using them as hand and foot holds. I didn't have to jump after all. I see the handles are on drawers and open one to see fleece pajama jeans for the campers. Now we go exploring and go around a corner to see a group of people singing religious songs. We turn and try to sneak away, realizing we've stumbled on a radical cult group. Now some are coming for us, one woman singing a fundamental hymn. We run back to the hole and get in. They are coming for us. I suggest we hide in a corner under a table, but they see us. This isn't good. (305 words)

I am swimming in a pool. Dovre's swim coach, an older plump athletic woman, watches me. I am a very good swimmer. She is impressed, but stoically watches, not encouraging me. I swim fast and do laps. Now she wants to train me for the team. Now I'm on an airplane, with a small girl with me. The coach is the pilot of this small craft. The little girl doesn't want to sit on the seat I chose for her right next to me because it's a "holding" seat. I assure her it is not a holding seat. The pilot coach also assures her. He sits reluctantly. Now in the back of the plane is a famous male movie star and the other women of the swim team are all agog around him. I watch him and he watches me. We are interested. Now we are at a party, perhaps at my mansion, and I change into a lovely evening gown. I am now drunk on bubbly champagne and fall, and stagger and giggle. (174 words)

I am at a conference, only it's in my living room. A woman comes from California and teaches. We'd had one last night and now I wake up on the couch and it's time for another one. The women come in and I sit up. The instructor is in the kitchen taking the dishes out of the dishwasher from last night as I hadn't gotten up and done them. I apologize to her, saying she doesn't have to do that. The dishes are white glass with gold trim on the edges. Bonnie had put them in because they'd been in my cupboard for so long and needed washing, from all the accumulated dust. A woman like Kathleen from poetry group sits on my right. I am telling them how the first time I used the word "abuse" to describe my upbringing felt so shocking, because it wasn't physical abuse, but emotional abuse. They were good people, but didn't know how to express themselves. Kathleen encourages me to keep calling it abuse and not cave in to society's ways of denial. I agree that I will persevere. I get up and say I need to pee and brush my teeth. There is a tiny alcove next to the living room, with a curtain as a door. I sit on a tall white bucket which sits on a toilet. I balance precariously. I pee a torrent of urine. It all rushes out of me at once. I know it can be heard by the women. Then the one man participant arrives. I immediately spill urine on the floor, it splatters from the rushing torrent. I am embarrassed. The topic f the conference is Men's Issues. I don't really want to be there, but I need the credits.

I am in a house. A silver-papered bag of cat food is in the sink, but we don't have cats any more. A tiny baby girl is laying on the floor. I dance around her, teasing her, my toes nearly stepping on her head and shoulders. She doesn't much like the teasing. I sing a chant about "No more flu germs, No more cold germs," like a chant to ward off germs. I prance around saying that over and over, and then as an afterthought, I say, "And no more germs from outside this room too," meaning if I go outside, I don't want to catch any germs there either. It's a way of protecting us. (116 words)
Barb Sanders:#2598 (10/11/93)

I have to pee really bad. I am in a house. Some man is injured and I am helping him. A cat is there somewhere, maybe also needing help. I go into a bathroom and try to sit on the toilet. It breaks off from the wall and is wobbly. I am standing and peeing so I won't tip it over. I pee voraciously all down my leg and around the room in front of me. I am concerned the water will back up and flow out of the toilet onto the floor. I leave. Now I am going from room to room in a hotel-like exhibit. I look out the window and see the beautiful emerald green ocean waves far below. There is a crowd of people walking through the exhibit as I am. I really need to pee and consider finding an exhibit toilet and using it. One room has a whirlpool and a single bed with an air mattress-like thing, sort of a health spa room. I wonder where people sleep and see another room with beds in it. I go out the door and go to the next exhibit room. On the way I see parrot beaded earrings and go over to see the price: 1 or 2 dollars, very cheap. I don't really want the parrots, but like crystal things or beaded things. [BL] (228 words)

I am swimming in a huge ocean and the waves are a solid wall of water. I feel fear that Ishall drown and decide that discretion is the better part of valor. I turn to swim back to shore but the waves that way are smaller, but more turbulent. I'm in trouble no matter which way I swim. Why am I there in the first place? (66 words)

I am holding a playwright class in my living room. "Merle," like Paul of old days, is there, the only one to show up. He is nervous and wants to leave, but I think he's cute and want him to stay. So he reads his scene and wants to go and I keep talking to keep him there, saying that at 1:00 Linda and perhaps others will be there and will need him to read their scenes. I tell him in detail, slowly, all about my new play opening up soon to keep him there. At 1:00 Linda rings the doorbell. I stand up and walk past Merle, caressing his thighs from behind seductively. He is surprised and not too pleased. (121 words)

I am a queen or princess. I can have anything I want. I feel sexually excited and grab a man and slide him under me and make love to him. I don't care who he is. He's like Dr. Fleischman of Northern Exposure. I have orgasm. Now I get up. I have a group of male guards around me all the time. I am walking through a field. I have a path worn around the edges of the field because I don't want to be wasteful and trample the beautiful flowers, and they are very pretty and colorful. Now the guard on my left will die for me, he loves me and is devoted so much to me. We approach the double doors of an auditorium of another country. A bishop or monk comes out in a hurry, sees me and bows, surprised. His hankie falls to the ground. He picks it up. We sweep past him and on to the crowd. My guard warns me to be careful, the crowd isn't on my side. As I prepare to walk to my center seat by the king of the country I am visiting, all the religious types file out, so they won't offend me with their presence. I go and sit by the king, but not in the chair provided. I sit up on a table, on top of income tax forms. The crowd is luke warm in their reception with the exception of one woman who is standing and facing back toward me applauding. She sees she's the only one and stops, confused. Now the star, a woman in a manual wheelchair, comes out on stage and makes a sarcastic remark at me, something like, "We'll wait until you are ready." I zing back a sarcastic remark like, "Oh, you sing? When did you start?" The crowd gasps at the sharp barbs. I sit haughtily. (316 words)

I am at a conference backstage with Mirabelle. She is going out to the front of the stage to give a message or speech. I agree to hold up a printed message for her so the audience can see the points she makes. I walk out following her. Someone whispers, B's standing up. Mary wanders down the aisle and I follow, feeling the strain of standing. I call a girl over and ask her to bring me one of the step ladder stools that had been set up for the presenters. She says Ginny or Karen McDonald had put those out for the speakers. I say, "Well, I'm one of them, so go get one." She does. Meanwhile Mary has picked up a sweet, little dark-haired baby and is holding it up for everyone to see. She's going to massage it. I reach out and touch the baby as Mary walks past me holding it up for everyone to see. I point where I want the stool to be placed, and then someone moves it down a center aisle. I sit on top of the upside down plastic Melmac plate on the stool. It's a bit wobbly. A woman brings me a blanket and whispers she also has a pillow if I need one. It's too warm and I say, "Here, thanks, but I don't need it now. I'll let you know when I do." Someone calls my name. I turn and see a woman in a manual wheelchair, dark short hair. She says, "Hi, seems the same people as last year are here again." I say, "Yeah, but we're trying to make it more consumer-oriented this year." She agrees this is good. (283 words)

I am at N City. I am given a plant, or rather several plants transplanted into one pot. There is room for one more plant in the pot and we look at different plants to find one that uses the same environmental conditions so it will be compatible. We find one sort of a tiny, ivy-like plant with small white flowers. It is very pretty. We put it into the pot. When these baby plants get growing they are going to be very beautiful. Now it's evening and time to go home to M City. Shall I wheelchair it to M City or take the Greyhound? I go for a while in the wheelchair and realize I'm lost. I ask this man for directions. He's very tall, towering over me. He tells me he is partially deaf on one side and I need to get used to his speech. I say, "I am too." So he starts trying to give me directions. I can't decide if I should wheel it or bus it. I try to call the bus depot for information but can't seem to get through. The phone book is buried behind papers and the man on the phone is unclear. He does finally say I can't get there directly from N City. I'd have t bus to Dover and then transfer. It will take lots of time and is difficult. I feel tired. (236 words)

I am a small child, girl. This Hitler kind of man puts a small chip like round lithium battery in my mouth and I swallow it. It has important info on it. I shit it out and he is looking for me to get his chip. War is starting and I have to leave; everyone is running around, trying to escape. I know that chip is important so I hang onto it, shit and all, and am swept by the crowd out of the house and onto a boat. As we are leaving, I want to call out to my Grandfather where I am and that I am safe and alive, but if I do, the Hitler man and a woman will hear. Then I worry if Grandfather is a part of them. I stay quiet. Now I am in some strange battle for my life. The chip transforms into some kinds of animals I can use as weapons. Three other girls use their weapons (animals) to fight me. I fight these biting animals off. It is hard. I steal their babies (stuffed little animals that are alive) and climb up a ladder to a high hidy hole. A huge male giant stands looking into my hidy hole, but I have pulled down a metal sheet that I can see through that apparently he can't see through. He stands there stupidly, not knowing what to do. The little captured animals want to get out and I must keep them with me so I can survive this fight to the death. (260 words)

I am working at a hotel counter. It's the end of a shift. Murphy Brown asks me to rotate and stay another shift because her child needs help. I go to the counter. Merle comes by and is sympathetic and agrees to stay and help. We are tired but trying to keep up. I pick up a glass of milk to drink but realize it is curdled, thick and creamy. It tastes terrible. I look up and see Murphy coming back very jauntily. We are exhausted and we poke a woman co-worker in the ribs and say, "Don't tell her." It's a silly kind of revenge. Murphy tries a glass of the stuff, poured over a cake as frosting, and loves it like it's buttermilk or something. Shucks! She would! Now a teen boy and girl comes up to the counter and I introduce them to Murphy, like she's their Aunt. The girl's name is Spirit. She grimaces when Murphy is introduced like, "Ugh, that eccentric Aunt!" We are exhausted and make mistakes because of it. We just want to be off duty and go home and sleep. (188 words)

I am a woman teacher in a prison. The orphan boys were brought in to get a taste of what it feels like to be prisoners so they'll think twice about being criminals. They are called pre-prisoners. I write, "Good morning" on the blackboard with a maroon colored chalk and step back to see if it is readable. It's not too good as other stuff is on the board and it blends in. I write my name, Barb Sanders. I then go to a boy and question him to see what kind of innate intelligence he as. I ask him if Nanu the whale was born with three different colors and it was dark when you saw him, would you see the black color part? It was a trick question. The boy had some ability. Now its break time and I walk around and see a group of women prisoners seated together talking. I try to join them, but they don't want me there, so I go to find a place to lie down and soak up the warm sun. The row of cars parked in the lot leave and there is a line of logs or boards left. I want to lie on one of the sections, but other people are sitting or lying on them. I find the end section empty. I lie down. I have a hard time balancing the plastic different colored glasses and dishes in the drawer, which is sort of me. A good-looking prisoner comes over and kisses me and moves the white bowl to another spot. Now I am more unbalanced and he moved the rows of colored glasses to the end of the section where my feet are. He is attractive and I don't know if I can trust him. He says he's going to meet me tomorrow morning. I go to my room and sleep. The next morning, I have a phone message from him. He can't make it. I am disappointed and concerned he's playing me for a sucker. He says to go ask the prison priest about him. I put on a fur parka and notice a cobweb with a spider hanging off my sleeve. I try to shake it off but I can't. Finally I ask a woman to help me get it off. It's a bit creepy not knowing where it is. Now I go to the priest to check out the man and the priest tells me the story of the man's life. He is the son of an evil multi-millionaire who the son turned in because the son is honest and good, and the father set him up. I am glad he is innocent because I am attracted to him. (455 words)

I am at a shop/library. A good-looking man is attracted to me. I am trying on different hats. One is an old leather brown flying pilot helmet. It looks silly on me. I hear Rochelle going by. She is talking about her hormones. She always talks like that. I don't want to make any noise so she'll know I'm there and come over and talk. Boring. I am going to connect with this delicious man.

I am talking to a man and explaining to him (he is like Vern H) how I could tell from his body language that he felt OK about disability. He is gentle and sweet. I start to show him what I mean, and it turns into a swim lesson. The woman teacher says, "Now gently sink down and submerge yourself into the water, keeping your nose open (not holding it pinched shut) and keeping their eyes open as well." I manage to do it, but am aware of some tension and wanting to come back up. When I am underwater, I see the circle of other students with me. We look into each other's eyes so we can see we did this with eyes open. Now I am given a small clump of white sticks with gold ends on them. They are defensive weapons. I use them to hit out at an attacking man. I hit him at the eyes and at the groin. The multi dimensions of the sticks are supposed to make it easier to hit and cause pain with. (182 words)

I am sitting on a pasture-like land. I see a tiny kitten sitting ahead of me. A large dog and a cow are playing near her and I get concerned because she could get accidentally stepped on. The cow gets very close and I get concerned. The kitten finally gets up in the nick of time and comes over and crawls into my arms. I pet it and hold it, relieved it moved out of harm's way. Now I notice the cow is very close to me and I realize it's the same situation. Someone bigger than me is behind me watching like I was with the kitten. I get up, holding the kitten, and move up on a big rock where I am safer. The scenery around me is expansive and beautiful and peaceful. I turn around so my back is to the ocean side and see the pasture. It is also a pretty view, even though not as spectacular as the usual view. (165 words)

I am leaning against a wall and talking to an Uncle, maybe Uncle Joel, whose wife is dead now. I am sympathetic. He leans on the wall with me and puts his arm around my shoulders comfortably. We chat. It feels nice to be comforted like that. He's very tall. Later, I am the "star" of a TV piece, where I am like a Murphy Brown character. I am standing at the edge of a lake or ocean facing back toward land where a crowd of people is gathered to watch. I am reminding them that years ago I did a role and this is very much like it. Did they remember the name of the character I did then? They didn't. They didn't much care. I dither on for a while, but can't get their interest. Suddenly, a mistake is made and the crew all disappears. I am left alone and a huge black Doberman is coming toward me, growling. I back away, saying, "Nice doggie." I throw him a pencil to bite on, but he keeps coming for me. I toss him a book, maybe my script book, and he spits it out and is loping right behind me as I run for the cover of the pickup truck. Where is the crew when you need them? (219 words)

I sit at a table in a cafe and see some earrings and jewelry that someone left. They are pretty. I ask the woman at the table if they are hers. She says no, she doesn't know who they belong to. I start picking them up to keep. I feel some guilt, because they do belong to someone and I didn't try very hard to find the owners. I feel like I'm stealing. I pick up a blue one and some woman says, "That's an owl feather one. That's bad luck if you wear it." I hold it up, close my eyes and try to feel the vibes. I ask my inner self if this is safe to wear. I decide it feels fine and I put it on. There is only one. Now a young woman actress is having auditions. I go in and read. It's a weird part, about a woman and spies and a super man or something, a long, involved story line. She gives me the lead part. I accept after asking if this is just a staged reading. So I go to her house, which she shares with many roommates. It's a large and busy house. She begins the rehearsal and it becomes clear to me that she intends for it to be a full production where I sing songs and am off book, memorizing all the lines, all with one week of rehearsal. I say to her, "Then I can't do this. Sorry, but you said it was just a staged reading." She glares at me and says, "I did not. I told you it would be the whole thing, but now you are waffling and letting me down." I say, "No, I remember you saying"--and we argued like that for a while. I was adamant and needed to protect myself and not do it. My throat couldn't take the pressure of singing and my mind couldn't take the pressure of memorization. I am relieved I am not doing it. She's pissed and ridicules me. Her roomies also look down on me. I leave. Now a man and myself are visiting a house, a sort of cult runs it. We decide to leave. Jerry Lewis is on the front porch talking to a woman and I recognize him but don't acknowledge him because I want to respect his right to privacy. Now we are walking down a road. Maybe the man is Ellie, and not a man. I look up and see a huge lake and say somewhat jokingly, "Are we going t walk across the lake??" She says, "No, but I guess I miscalculated and the water here in the road is too deep." I see puddles almost covering the road. I say, "Wait and see." I try to pick my way across and manage to do it, with a cute hop from one place to another. Ellie thinks I'm very clever and votes to do it that way. We keep walking, then we realize we left the little girl behind at the house. How embarrassing and what a bad thing to do! We look back and see a long line of people parading and she is in the line, in a cute bunny suit with a curly wig on. We are relieved she is coming to find us and a bit concerned how she's getting sucked into the cult's activities. We circle around to go back to meet her and lose her in the crowd. The cult leaders see us and are moving in to entrap us too. We keep moving. Now we enter a town and try to find a building to go into to hide. We don't and then I see another huge body of water where crocodiles are swimming and snapping. We decide it is safer to stay on land; there are still crocodiles but we can see them coming. They come and one bites my leg. I peel him off and use a piece of wood to stick in the jaws of oncoming crocodiles. The place is infested. (680 words)

I am at some campground where a conference is being held. Mary and Lucy are there. I go ahead to get us a seat at the luncheon tables, big round tables with pink tablecloths on them. I find one very close to where the speaker will be and secure a spot, saving a couple of spots for my friends. Other people are trying to sit at the table. Suddenly I realize that Deepak Chopra is sitting at the table. I see he looks ill. He has a snot booger hanging off his nose and looks bad. I say sympathetically, "You look ill." He smiles weakly. I try to help him. I offer to sort his speeches in chronological order for him. Later I go to his house with him as we'd struck up a relationship, but there aren't ramps and it is hard to get in and out. I gently chide him that he is not very sensitive to the disabled, even though he is one himself. Later I am W. talking with a couple of male friends about stuff and mention my co-worker John.

I am on a train track and running from the Nazis and I rest for a second. Someone says, "Take a bath now because when the war is nearly over you won't have time." So I take a wonderful hot bath and then hear the Nazi train coming and get out quickly to dry off and change into clean clothes. My family runs for cover and I run down the sidewalk, trying to get to the border where the Dutch can help me. He (the huge German guard) yells, "Halt," and I run. I pour a cream-based jelly out of a tube into his eyes as my defense. He tries to shoot me. I run. I make it to the intersection and try to cross. A Dutch person comes across and helps me across. The German follows and I nearly empty the tube in his eyes and kick at his groin and trip him. He falls and I yell, "Get me a gun." I meant to kill him. The Dutch laughs nervously, surely she doesn't mean to use it. Some wise person says gently, "Get her the gun. She won't kill, but needs to make the effort of holding him at gunpoint for her dignity." (205 words)

I light some candles and they melt quickly and spread a melting pool of candle wax on the table and on the floor. The kids must have been playing with the candles before. I try to clean up the growing mass of candle wax. Finally, I figure out to blow out the candles to not keep making up more of a mess. (62 words)

I am being chased by a bad guy. I'm a sort of spy. My helper, a man, is telling me to keep walking and to find a room to hide in for a while until the danger blows over. He's speaking into an earpiece I have in my right ear. I walk and walk and lose the guy and go into a sleazy hotel and get a room. The sympathetic landlord agrees to send up food until it is safe to come out. I go in the room, but there are many doors that keep opening and I am busy going around and locking doors and putting furniture up against them. There is another room and I need all this sealed off, and so I keep trying to remodel the room with my thoughts and see it small and only one door, which I can lean the bed up against. It's hard to get it to change to that. Doors keep popping up all over the room. (167 words)

I am an exchange student in France. A very fat woman is the lady of the house and she is asking me to do some chores around the place. I'm a bit annoyed, but do so. She wants me to do the dishes and then read stories in English to the children. It helps them with their language skills. I have a hard time speaking French. [BL] (66 words)

I am the director of a film. I am filled with the enormity of how important each decision is, and I have to make each decision frame by frame. Millions of dollars ride on it. I look into the camera viewfinder and give direction. We are filming a getaway down a very big and steep mountain. I am getting different angles. Now I take time out to look at photos of the shoot. People keep coming up and asking me questions. I tell them to give a few minutes of my own to enjoy these photos, pictures of a crevasse in the mountain and so on. One woman says "Oh, the plastics" meaning the photos. I have trouble getting a few moments to myself. (124 words)

I am a member of a two- person team and the other team is getting ready to descend the cliff. We sneak under them at the base of the cliff to spy. They are wimps and are going to drive down and around in a car rather than repel down the cliff face, like we did. I keep very close to the rock face so they won't see us. I keep shifting my position around to remain undetected. Now I am creeping down a long dirt rut behind a shield of grasses. A goat comes up to me and is grazing. I get around the goat and see the hut of a native African friend of mine and ask his wife if I may come in to observe the other team through their window. She agrees. It is a skinny little room and only one chair in it and I use it to sit in front of a round, pretty window. The window has a slit in it and there is a wooden shield closed over it. I ask the woman to open the shield so I may see. She goes outside and does so. I see two men seated near the window talking, an English captain and someone else. I listen in on their conversation, hoping they don't see me. (221 words)

I need to go to the store my woman owns. I am sort of Dwight. We'd taken the night off to be together, and I need to get some stationery. I take a dime out of her wallet and ask if she wants to come along. She says she's tired and she'll stay home. I say, "Ok, I'll be right back." I am walking barefoot and with each step, I say, "This is stupid. Why am I doing this? Because I forgot to bring more money which means I'll have to come back tomorrow anyway so this is a wasted trip. And each step I take is doubled with the step to return and then I just have to repeat it again tomorrow." I stubbornly keep going, however, arguing with myself all the way. I get there and am looking for the part of the store my woman owns (she is like O'Conner of Northern Exposure). The place is a mess and needs to be organized. I'm too tired to do it now and I'm upset because I haven't the time to do it right, and I feel frustrated. Suddenly, my woman shows up at the door, apologizing for letting me take the walk alone. She said she realized that the time we spent together was very precious and more important than anything, so we'll spend it together cleaning and organizing the store. I am pleased and happy that she sees it this way. (244 words)

I work for some TV company or something. I am working on my dreams. Carlene of Merton Circle comes over to see how I'm doing. I explain to her that lots of people say I'm obsessing on working on my dreams, and maybe they are right, but I just have to do it. She sympathizes and says she's working for hours at a time on a computer program. She understands. I am now opening envelopes and finding 10 dollars in cash in them. People are finally sending me some grudging support for my birthday, or for my dreams project. Some arrogant man isn't working out for the company. Someone measures the love a man has for me and Dwight's love for me. Dwight's love is stronger. (126 words)

Jock says to me he just now heard that he wasn't being paid for his work on a play. I say, "What a gyp." Another man says, "It's not really a problem, because all we have to do is fill out this form and take it to the office and they'll come up with the money." I decide to do this and try to fill it out. Now I'm walking to take the form to the office and I'm walking on a "carpet" of sticks and twigs and hollow cork bark and pussy willows which have been sorted carefully so each kind of thing is all in a row. I pick up a cork bark still in the shape of a branch and admire its beauty. I admire the work that went into laying all the pussy willows out together in a row. (143 words)

I am at some huge gym where there are lots of bleachers, and Marianne Fabray sees me and she says, "Come sit where I am," and we walk to the corner and go up. She helps me walk up the bleachers and we sit. I'm not going to be able to see well from there when others sit, and then I sit on something that raises me up so it will be OK. Now it is announced that there is a team driving course and a man named Andy, kind of round faced and wimpy, has a car and we decide to do it. The first run through he's the driver and I'm the passenger. I watch as he drives and try to remember the curves. We come around one and he says they didn't let us know it was so steep a curve before. He's slow and cautious. He passes two slow cars on the right. I am urging him to go faster and thinking I'll really go fast when I drive, and wish I had time to practice with the clutch so I can feel it right. We get to the finish and have to return to our place in the bleachers and then return for my driving part. I somehow get lost or decide to skip that part and I show up without the car or Andy and realize he won't know I'm there and we only have 5 minutes till start time. I tell this official woman who suggests we page the bleachers. She turns on a microphone and says for Andy to meet me there. He does come and I apologize several times for not being at the right place, and thank goodness this is working out. Now we are in a line, only where I am standing is in a small, cold freezer chest for food. I realize this is where they keep the food and back up out of it. Andy goes to the head of the line at the counter to get our fees paid and so on. Two military navy men are behind me and talking. One says loudly, "Look at the son of a bitch," meaning me. I turn and say scathingly and angrily, "Oh yeah? who's the son of a bitch?" We stare at each other confrontationally. I feel powerful. No one is going to mess with me. Then I notice the man at the counter is giving Andy trouble and asking for 10 dollars instead of the 7 dollars. I push my way up there and lean on the counter and chew the man out. I yell like a drill sergeant and say, "Either you straighten this out or let me speak to your supervisor, ass hole" He is arrogant but the woman supervisor hears me and comes forward and fixes things. She gives us our tokens we have to place at particular curves and the necklaces we have to wear. I ask her two or three times for clarification on whether a specific token must go at a specific curve and if I have to wear the specified necklace, because I saw one metal round one with two blue herons carved in black wrought iron on it and want to wear that one. She agrees it doesn't matter. Now we are finally ready to do the drive. I am ready to put my foot to the metal and speed; I test the clutch and we are off. (580 words)

I am playing a guitar on a stage and I play well. There is a man there who is in competition with me. I get off the stage and run hurriedly into the audience crowd to try to get away from the man. He teases me hard, or something. I run into the women's room. I come out and someone is interviewing the man, who is drunk, and he kisses me and the interviewer on stage says something and the man says, "Hey, I'm married and I am loyal to my wife." I am asked if he's a good kisser. I say, "Yes he is. He smells like shit, but he's a good kisser," and I see his mouth is full of duck shit, green stuff, and the cement corner he had been leaning or sitting in had shit on it too. It's nauseating. Now I see on the stage some animal act where the ducks are trained to raise their wings and gesture them like arms and they are told to find someone and cure him, like a doctor. I watch as they all line up at their spots against the side walls and put their heads to the wall like in hide and seek. I think, "How interesting." They probably had to train a long time to be able to do that. They have sacks over their heads. I feel gritty stuff in my throat from the duck shit kiss. (242 words)

I am with Ginny and Ernie. Ernie gives me sweet glances of love. I am unsettled. It feels wonderful and I feel terrible because it isn't right. I try to avoid him. He follows me around and then finally says, "I want to kiss you." I walk away. Then he comes up behind me and hugs me gently and with love. I want to relax into it, but walk away. Ginny comes in and I don't know how to act. Ernie says truthfully and directly, "I kissed B." Ginny bursts into tears and walks away angrily. I follow her saying it won't happen again. She says angrily, "You can have him." I say, "No, he's yours." We do this back and forth. (122 words)

I am awakened by Corinne. I am grumpy and exhausted and sleepy but she says it's important because Darcy and her husband are upset and might leave the reunion, and it's uncomfortable and everyone is having a hard time talking, not knowing what to say. I get up and find Darcy and her husband. I say, "I hear you two had a hard time." Darcy looks very serious. She explains that her husband drew up blueprint plans and made an error and now they may lose this job because he made an error. I soothe them and ask questions about the man who hired them. I assure them he probably would feel confident when they correct the error and show him how they can stick to it and fix things. I suddenly realize the man seated with us is the client they are worried about. I begin talking to him and realize he is a very nice man. He plays baseball for a living. I say, "Let's go jogging, but I have to go to the bathroom first." He agrees. He follows me, talking, and we are having a great time getting to know each other. I come out of the bathroom and he is seated and I ask him something and then I see he's crying. All the tears are streaming down from the right eye as I face him. I say, "Let's talk." He sits at a table. He hesitates, but I am such a good listener that he talks of his troubles and pain. He says, "You are very good at this." I say, "I am a professional." He says, "Then I must pay you." I say, "Oh no, because I offered it as a friend." I feel very tender and like this man a lot. Now we go out to do a jog only we find Dovre and we are going to visit her home. Se step on a conveyor belt thing and are whisked around and then Dovre says, "You aren't going to like this part." I look and see we are going straight up and then straight down in a tight tube. I feel claustrophobic and scared but we get through. Dovre reminds me to step off and walk normally when the green fake grass like belt ends. I do so and now we go into the house. Dovre says something to the man, who doesn't respond. I say, "He's hard of hearing, repeat it." Then we go in and I am going to introduce him to my parents and my "brother" and my "Uncle Bob." I debate if I should announce he is hard of hearing and decide to trust that he can take care of it himself. I say, "This is my parents," and so on. When we get to Uncle Bob, seated with "my brother" on the couch, the man says, "He sure looks like you" (or your father) and I say, "Yes." Then my "brother" says, "I sure like him. Maybe I'll become a hairdresser and really like him." It was a joke. My mother says, "Don't joke like that, people will think things." I say as a joke to her, "Mom, please, try to be more PC," politically correct. I sure do like this man. (546 words)

I am walking with Ellie and Charla. A huge, rough man comes rushing past and beyond us on the sidewalk to an empty field. Ellie starts taking off her clothes. I am appalled. I want us to get out of here and back toward safety and she seems to be courting the danger. He sits in the muddy grass. She goes over and sits with him. I turn and walk away back to the sidewalk with Charla. I see two steps up to the cement sidewalk and a huge horse turd on the step and a gun or rifle the man had put there. Now the man is roughing up Ellie, and she cries out "No, don't hit me, then I'll look bad for my boyfriend. He'll be upset." The man is going to hurt her, possibly rape her. Ellie calls out for them to stop; another man is going to help him. I rush up the sidewalk calling out, "Help me. I need a phone. Help me someone." I go to apartment buildings and pound on doors and look for lights that indicate anyone is home. No one is home or responds. "Help me," I call, now leaving Charla behind in the men's pickup truck in order to go faster for help. I am scared and concerned for them both. (221 words)

The Merton Circle is meeting. It's a large group, and Hillary says during the break, "Why don't you tell us what's going on for you now?" I am shy and hesitate, but go up in front of this group and speak. This is fun, like when I was teaching, making them laugh and think. They are warmly responsive. I say, "As you know, when we first met, I was teaching at the community college, well, at east, part time and now things are changed." Tyler says, "Boy, have they!" I smile. I say, "And so now I am going back to high school." They laugh with me. I say, "To learn math." Tyler says, "Calculus." I say, "Yes, I am interested in some aspects of physics and math has always been hard and this ties into how much the Merton circle has changed." They all murmur agreement. I say, "We need to talk about this. I'm not sure I like the changes." (162 words)

I am in a huge house being made over into apartments. There are lots of interesting rooms off rooms. Ellie and Charla and I take a room and I am looking to see where to put my furniture. I see I have a sort of hallway. and someone else, a man, has put a chest of drawers in the bathroom. I go exploring and find another room in yellow paint with a nice window looking out to the busy city streets and I hear music from some dancing place across the street. I go back out to the big room and go around a corner and see Ellie's side. She has a beautiful closet with all her clothes hung up and pretty things and lots of room. I say, "Maybe we can move things around so I can share this space. I can bring my bed in here, and use that yellow room for writing." Then I look out the window. There are lots of interestingly dressed people walking by in crowds, people with roses, headdresses and so on. I say, "Ellie, bring me my camera." She does and I look through the viewfinder, trying out different shots, looking for a good one, trying to be more discriminating than I usually am. I get frustrated as none of the shots look really good. I sit on the edge of a window, knowing it is several floors down, and feel balanced precariously. Ellie asks me if that isn't dangerous. I say, "It could be, but I'm being careful." Then the camera isn't working well and Ellie opens it and sees I've wound up toilet paper into the case by accident. It had been on the bottom holding something broken. Now it's all enmeshed with the film. I say, "The film will be ruined," and I burst into tears and sob and sob. I am so stupid. Ellie says, "You did the best you could," and tries to console me. I walk to the bathroom to pee and Charla follows and I sob, "I didn't now it was going to be like this, when I was a child, I mean. Thank God." I see Charla has on a pretty dress and compliment her. I don't want her distressed with my sadness. (379 words)

I am in a building and trying to get a job. I am going to go take classes at the University and want to work part time also. Ellie comes in and is going to apply also. I am very upset. She will mess up my chances. I go to an elevator, which is a tiny space at the top of a flight of stairs, and go down a flight. I am going to go to classes. Now I return, using the same elevator. I go to my new room, which I will live in and counsel in. I try to set it up. Then I think I have two rooms, one with a bed and a tiny kitchen and the original room for counseling sessions. I can be very economical with my living needs because that isn't as important to have the conventional space a house would have. I do want to separate the living space from the counseling space.

I am in a play about disability that Jock wrote. At first I am sort of a volunteer from the audience. I get up backstage, in the side wings, and sit in a chair. I realize I'll be the first one called on stage. I change my chair so I'll come later. Unfortunately, I end up being the last one and they don't have time for me. I am disappointed and wish I'd had the courage to be first. I go back into the audience and later I am in my wheelchair and I'm going back on stage to be an actress. I back up and the chair tips over and I gracefully roll out of it, unhurt. The audience is upset and concerned and I show them how this is normal to reassure them. It is also part of the play. Now it is later and Jock has returned with a rewrite of the play. I am reading it and seeing the images like a movie. He has completely changed the script and it is science fiction now. I ask him if I'm still in it because it's so changed. He laughs and says, "Oh, yes." I see from the perspective of the enemy aliens who have laser beam guns and they try to shoot my ships out of the sky. We have protective shields and the enemy is in awe because to them it looks like a ship within an invisible ship. The beams bounce off. Now they narrate how they will follow the ship, but unfortunately there are huge seas and oceans on this planet and it is infested with mean and dangerous sea lions. Every dock where they can launch from has hundreds of these huge beasts near it. I see them. We are skimming over the surface of the ocean like in a low flying glider and looking for a place to launch from that isn't covered with sea lions. We have to go far out to do that. Now we are in a room talking, and Jock's wife Melinda is there. I say to Jock how much his writing has improved. I am impressed and a bit jealous. (364 words)

Bonnie and Mateo and I are traveling, planning to go to Paris. Some crazy woman from India interferes and we lose Bonnie. Mateo and I are going to get on a train but if we do, Bonnie will never find us and I'll end up having to care for Mateo. This was not my plan, to be baby-sitting when in Paris. I try to back track, and remember clues. I must search a computer data bank for info that will help. I feel thwarted. Now I am trying on clothes, I saw a pretty suit. I think will look nice. I put it on: a leather suede jacket, a wool textured skirt, a lavender blue silk like blouse. Corinne is there and feels the material and says, "This is wrong for you, textured like that. It will be hard to work." I am annoyed at her. I want the outfit to work. I like it. Corinne has laid out a bunch of pretty earrings and I like three of them, blue glass and clear glass. I would like to have them. She has them out over my outfit, making it hard to get to my things. I look in the mirror. I open the top button on the blouse and say, "I like it a bit open like this, what do you think?" She agrees, but is still reserved and negative. The outfit feels heavy and cumbersome, but I like it. I feel the hem line at my ankles. Something about a person from India (like Chopra? I better beware of them). (262 words)

I tell my mother I am going to church. She doesn't really approve. I am Murphy Brown. I sit in the front row and the minister is two twin women who sometimes look like a two-headed woman. She is preaching. I see Uncle Lionel and I cry, because he is dead. I leave the church to go out and try to be near him. He is sort of invisible. He hands me a poster or flyer or letter he wrote before he died, which is a narrative of his last days. I cry and cry because he was a good man and I will miss him. A young man is there, maybe like Abner or Arthur The story is that young men were musicians and they carried some disease and Lionel got it. Gasp: does that mean Lionel had AIDS? I thought he had cancer. I am assured he didn't have AIDS. He then describes how he and Aunt Elaine escaped from a nursing home and went off to the coast to fish until he died. I loved his rebellious spirit and his sweet humor. He felt sad for the young men who didn't even know they had the disease. (200 words)

I want to attend a seminar, like the Chopra one. I line up very early to get a good seat up front. Then I am told it is being held in another spot and I go there to discover I'm a bit late and only get a spot in some other more distant section. It even requires another entrance at another field, called "Hunsaker "or something like that. I start to try and find the place to go and am told I have to take a shuttle bus thing there. As I am going to the bus stop, I tell some woman the story of how people resent people with disabilities and tell the Chopra story of the woman who said, "You have kind of an advantage, don't you?" I find a bus stop, but I'm not sure this is the right spot and I do not want to miss the bus. One comes from the wrong direction and stops and I run over to ask the driver if this is the right one or not. I nearly get hit by the bus as it pulls up to the stop. It is "articulated." He looks down at me and I can't seem to understand him, whether this is the one or not. I finally decide this is the one going to the station and go back to my spot to wait. The seminar seems so distant now. [BL] (237 words)

I'm in a big gym and finished for the day. It's time to go home. I take my clothes I want to change into, a more informal, sexy outfit. I go to the gas station to change in the restroom and see that Jerome has taken over the place and is busily and energetically setting up things for sale. It's a fundraiser thing, I think. I walk around the premises looking for the restroom. I change, to a red tank top and a blouse. I look pretty good and feel comfortable. Now I'm walking to the car to leave. Jerome calls me into a room to say goodbye. He and I had been antagonistic and attracted to each other. He leans me into a wall and presses his full body against me and kisses me. I respond, which surprises him pleasantly. I want to show him I am sexually warm and responsive. Now he has me pinned to the wall and is working at getting me excited. I feel manipulated and pull his hand away from my vagina. I say, "No." He hints I am a prick tease. I say, "No, I just want it to be real, not for games." I walk away with mixed feelings. After all, it felt delicious up to a point. I write his name on a line in a book, last name first, and rewrite it in red ink because it wasn't very clear. (240 words)

I am laying in a bed and my mother and Corinne and Dwight are there. We are talking. I say to my mother, "You and my father, but mostly you, are very injured people. I don't know how you stood it all this time." She smiles and agrees it has been hard. I say, "You could work on it; it would be hard but it could be done." She agrees. Then she asks what I want to do, and I say, "I want to live on an island near a big city and do my writing and my art work." My mother looks at a painting of a wooded area I did and says, "It is good work." I feel warm and appreciated and acknowledged. (125 words)

I realize I'm going on stage in 45 minutes and I thought I'd have my script with me, but I won't. I say to Jock sheepishly, "I haven't memorized my lines." He is very upset and disgusted with my lazy unprofessionalism. I pick up the pages, hanging on a wire, each page in a plastic sheet protector, and go away with the intent of committing it all to memory in 45 minutes. I do it, but it is very intense and concentrated work. (83 words)

Now I am going to the bathroom. A black family is in the area with me. The father doesn't approve of me. I say, "I am going to a show at the United Brethren Methodist Church," which is black. The mother approves. The children, a boy and a girl, about 12 years old, or 10, like me. We roller skate together, the boy on my right, the girl on my left. The scenery is breathtaking: horses, wide open spaces on the right. We get to the church and they take me to a small office room where a going away party is going on for a white woman who is playing a character of mine in the show. They are all very happy to see me. She hugs me; they are very impressed with my work. Now a young man, the actor John Ritter, is in love with a young woman and he courts her. She is going to declare her love of him and she hands him a gift. It's a joke gift that teases him and then she hands him a real gift, a box of baby things and so on. He takes this to mean she is pregnant and they will be married. He is thrilled. They embrace, and I lay next to them on the floor feeling much sadness and poignancy at being this close to that kind of love, but not being involved myself. Now I'm the young man, who is chosen as the "Ron," like a homecoming king at high school. I stand in the back of a pickup and wave to the crowds who cheer me and want me to stay. I want to leave to be alone with my love. I am torn between the two needs. (295 words)

I am standing in a public bathroom in a health clinic place and combing my hair. I am very upset, because I scratched a sore scab and it is coming off with my hair attached (like my psoriasis of long ago) and I have bald spots. I am looking in the mirror at all the ugly black and blue bald spots and bloody lines where I've scratched them. Maybe my daughter Ellie, or someone like her, agrees to shampoo my hair and color it with dye. My hair is a dark black now. I don't know how I like that (color of June's hair). My blouse and bra are off and now two old men, gay men, get in the bathtub to do therapy together. I feel a bit uncomfortable, being so naked, but think, "Oh well, it's OK. This is a clinic." I turn and am now putting on my bra. One of the old men, now out of the tub says, "I hope she keeps the cleavage. It's great cleavage." I look into his eyes and he has on weird glasses like opera glasses inset into his eyes. I hurriedly try to get dressed. There is another room where patients are being treated, mental therapy. I am pacing. I am now a man. My friend comes in and asks where I am, even though I am pacing right past him. Other people (women) in the room laugh. I say, "Vagina," and a man laughs archly, "Aha." I am upset he misunderstood me and say, "No, not that meaning. I was trying to explain about a woman being pregnant." [BL] (270 words)

I am in my wheelchair and going down the sidewalk. I go to a building and take a sealed envelope in. It is crowded and not easy to get around, so I go to a man who works there who is typing things. I interrupt him and say, "I want to turn this in. It's that scratch sheet or questionnaire thing." He takes it and I say, "It's not too accessible here." He looks around; he's a very busy man. I say, "I've been here for concerts before and it is hard to get around." He is trying to figure out how I can get in, as the tables are all set up in a huge square in this gym-like room. I say, "It's OK, it really is accessible, but I don't want to be there" (for whatever boring event it is), I just brought the paper by. I leave and go home. As I enter, a small boy is standing behind a large dog, a Great Dane kind. He is pulling on his back legs as the dog is eating his dinner. It looks like he is humping the dog, but he isn't. I laugh. I hear the teen kids talking about football practice, they love it, twice a week, and how they can get their mother out of the house or otherwise engaged when the football kids come so she won't embarrass them. She doesn't like or understand football. (241 words)

I am on an arduous journey, a difficult time where I am with enemies, captured, enslaved. Our people come home, finally, we escape. The man, native American, that I worked with, is nearby. I slowly realize that this is our group's last moments together, the last night before we all break away and go on our own ways. I start feeling sad and nostalgic. He watches me. I step to the side and want to walk around outside. I see a place I might go to the bathroom, a hilly knoll. I get there and see an old gnome woman and a line of cute animals in a row. I say, "Oh, I didn't realize there were people here." She says, "Stay, if you want." I am embarrassed. I say, "Oh I just saw the cute animals and was curious." Actually, I needed to pee and walked off. It isn't appropriate to just sit on anything around and pee, copiously, anymore: couches, the ground. It creates a terrible stink for others. I go back and sit, holding the red leather wallet of the man gently in my hands. I stand up and walk to the open wall and look out at a huge movie screen in the rich house across the way. A love scene is on the screen and I feel sad. He wonders what I am looking at and walks near to see. I am embarrassed because it would be better if I was looking at mother nature, but I am looking at a TV or movie screen. I turn and walk back in. I hold this document journal book from the trip and then sigh and put it back where he had it. I replace the wallet. I hold a packet of photos and Ellie suggests she take them and get them developed tomorrow. I don't want to trust her with them. I don't want them misplaced or stolen. I hold on to them. I then see flashes of his face when we had been on trips or camp outs before and I realize he is the injured one I had taken for granted and not noticed much. I see his scarred and injured face. I realize he's been through some surgeries and now he is sweet and good-looking. I want to touch the scars on his face lovingly. He now realizes I am waking up to my feelings about him. He comes softly to me and suggests we debrief our travels. I look around the room to see what other group members he meant and see I am practically the only one there. He meant me. I agree shyly. Now I touch his face softly. I feel wonderment and sadness and love. I had been so blind, so numb, I had not given a moment's thought or feeling to what I had with me all this time. I am very touched. He is happy I finally have connected with him in a loving way. (498 words)

I and Valerie are sitting in a chair together and my mother is seated in another chair. she tells a story about Jake when he was a baby. She relates that someone noticed his tail wrapped around her breast when he was nursing. I suddenly say, "Oh, what an incredible metaphor." She looks at me suspiciously, with huge eyes with enormous pupils, and says, "Is this going to be profound?" I sigh with frustration. She never understands. I try to explain, "When other people say 'space,' you hear that you are at fault." She does not understand and I am frustrated at her again. (104 words)

I am in a room and there are alien beings in human form. They capture me and put me in a room to lock me in. My young boy and younger girl are with me. I see many bright yellow ripe bananas on the floor. This will be our food. I go to a window because I hear the sound of a monkey, apparently being enticed there by the bananas. The enterprising monkey opens and unlocks the window. I have a way of escape. The male alien comes in and I stand in a way that hides the monkey. I don't want him to know I can escape. He leaves. I now gather up papers on the floor and find one with money paper clipped to it, odd denomination bills, like $7.50 or a $13.50 bill. I am choosing what ones to give the children so they will have the resources with them as I send them out to get help. They leave and Rochelle is now in the room. Another woman is there and she asks Rochelle how she's doing. Rochelle says, "Oh, I was very presumptuous. This man was teaching the first grade and he made a mistake and I assumed that meant they'd fire him and I'd have the job, but people are behind him and supporting him." I admire her honesty. She has on a blue denim like poochy cloth hat with a bill on it and has several sets of lips, or several shades of lipsticks on. (252 words)

I am in the very roomy back seat of a chauffeur-driven limo that Nate and Cate Evers own. We are just driving around and Cate is talking about feeling depressed, even tough she has everything. I talk to her like a counselor, saying, "I know you know all this, being counselors yourself, but the problem is..." and I go on. Nate shows me a poster he made with a series of pictures of children crying. One is crying so hard she looks like she is beaming a laughing smile. Nate says, "She's finally taking a breath." I agree that is hard to observe, the child crying so hard they don't breathe. I notice the area behind the back seat is a huge room like a trailer house. I go back to explore a bit. I notice the chauffeur is in a black uniform. He's male and a bit overweight and large. The steering wheel is in the center of this long roomy front seat. Now we get out and go right into a building where some religious women are training the children. They turn them upside down and spank them harshly. The children are crying and crying. I am appalled and say to her angrily, "This is abuse. What are you doing?" The woman says they are training the children. I say, "You sure are...training them to be docile and to accept whatever you give them spiritually as the truth. This is shocking." I turn and go out to the front porch and as I leave, I turn and say to her, "When we die, I will go to heaven and you will go to hell." She sneers and says, "You have no hell" (meaning no religious beliefs that are real, like theirs). (293 words)

I am writing a story. It must be only 1 and 1/2 pages long. I am very conscious of the fact that I must be aware of the form and then make the content work with it. This seemed a very important lesson about good writing. (46 words)

Another person and I take a shortcut across the lawn. The grass is filled with fallen apples, very pretty. I worry a bit about getting caught, leaving wheel tracks across this beautiful lawn. We go downstairs to make Xerox copies of words and letters, the alphabet and so on from some long document. Then I look on the wall to see where the copies are being kept. I find the right hole and take out the copies to examine them, wanting to make sure that when I put in the letter "c," I also go the capital version as well. I did. There is something about time travel and magic. (110 words)

My rooms are very cluttered and messy. Some women friends come by to visit and peek in and start to go away because it is such a mess. I call to them and say, "I've been cleaning it up; come on in." They do. Now I am at a doctor's office. A man like Billy Crystal sits on a toilet and gets some procedure up the ass. He now understands what it is like for women giving birth and so on. He is surprised at the pain. Now I am going on a drive and read an account that thousands of starlings are in the area. I want to see them, it would be beautiful and interesting, but I add, "Not where I'm driving, because I could get into a wreck." I'm driving along the coast. I stop and see a small boy crying and adults trying to explain things to him. A woman says, "He wanted a cone to eat." I say, "I have one." She says it's OK to give it to him. I go down a ramp to him and show him the ice cream cone, which is filled with sticky cactus-like things. He's eats it all. I am amazed. As I go back up the ramp, walking, I notice some of the sticky cactus things are stuck in my flesh. I pull a long thin thread of one out of the palm of my hand. Then another one and several others on my hand. Then the woman, like Hillary of Merton Circle, says, "You are bleeding," and I see a hole in the palm of my hand with blood drops coming out. One drop falls to the floor. She assures me I'll be all right. I keep pulling these things out of me. (297 words)

I am in a room and some people are getting ready for a party. I walk around the pillar in the room, like prancing. Then I see a man burn his hand in steam at the sink and I go to him and say, "It might help if you put butter on it." I open the refrigerator door and pull out a stick of butter and rub it on his injured hand, which is a dark brown. It melts yellow on him and I get too much on. I apologize. Then I want to write down the dream I had before I forget it. I have two half finished dreams to write. I am using a quill-like pen and dip it in a chocolate-like ink. I have trouble getting the ink to form the words right. They bunch up like it has sand in it. Mateo interrupts and asks what I'm doing. I say, "Look, the dream was about a birthday party in Mexico. See, the boys are invited so the parents can look them over. See what they do for a living, how much money they have, the family background. If they approve of them, they let the girl date them. They form two groups, the girls in one group, the boys in another." I then tell Mateo about the quincinero, how the girl is 15 and it's as ornate as a wedding, her dress is. Mateo gets bored; he's heard this story before. I tell him about how Hector wasn't very rich, but his Uncle, the police chief, was. I remember the opulent dinner party we witnessed and shiver, Really rich. "But I've told you all this before," I say to Mateo. I still want to tell the story, but he doesn't want to listen. There is a cat around somewhere. (303 words)

I am teaching a kindergarten class. My daughter Dovre has been working with Madonna, the sex queen rock star. They come to visit. Dovre's face is all covered with makeup and I am a bit shook up at how different she is. I try to get her and Madonna to behave well in front of the children. Now Ellie and Charla and a baby boy are there and Ellie makes a mess and I demand she clean it up. She refuses and I get furious and slap her face and fight her and scream "bitch" at her. Others have to drag me off her and take me away from the children because my behavior is not OK for them to see. They ask me to cool down when the children are there and I am so furious I can't. Later, Ellie comes to visit me again. I tell her off and call her names. This hurts her feelings. I don't care. I am so upset that I now have my house moved around the corner and bushes are grown around the door so in case I go off the deep end about Ellie again, the children will not be exposed to my behavior. This upsets me because it is Ellie who creates the problem. I am merely reacting to her, and it's my life that is getting changed. (228 words)

I am trying to clean up the mess in my rooms, reorganize my things. I find a box of muffin-like cookies and bite into one. It is sinfully delicious, with puffs of chocolate on top. I get sexually excited and want to make love. I yell to someone to send Melville down to me. I go into another room and a woman insists she wants to make love to me and this angers me. She's like Howard in her crass insistence. I push her away. I call again for Melville. I go upstairs to find him and he is an ugly thing with a huge jaw that protrudes out and a part of it falls off his face. This is repulsive and I change my mind. I go back downstairs and move dishes and jewelry around, trying o get things to be where they belong so things are more functional and useful and pleasant to look at. (157 words)

I walk into a room with two bathtubs and a shower. A man is taking a bath in one tub and I decide to take a bath. I then decide to shower. I get in and am wiggling around to get all the spray because it feels so good and warm, and I know the man can see my movements through the glass shower door. Then suddenly the shower door slides open and two naked men come in to rape me. I bite and kick and scream, "Stop it, stop it." I then see myself from behind and see the purple welts I have (from the arthritis and bunches of single strands of course black stubby hairs growing out of my butt. Not very pretty. I wake with my voice screaming, "Stop it," in my head, very loud and realistic. Nightmare quality. (142 words)

A boy and a girl are going to do a bit of a speech from a play I wrote to show this man. The boy says, "I'd like to put in an explanation here," and I say, "It's not necessary. If you'd do the bit that I wrote just before it, it will be clear." The man questions me and I explain if he'd do it as I wrote it, it would be fine. So the boy starts. They ride off on a tricycle and I say to the man, "It went too slow. I didn't write all those words." He smiles and doesn't quite believe me. Then a woman interrupts, asking if I was the one that sold the beads. I say yes. She opens a backpack to look at the beads. I am seated on a couch and start to scoot to the other side to give her room to lay out the packages of beads. I am now smooched clear to the other end and she says to me, "Your girls said you were the one that kisses." I said, "I'm the best kisser." The girls do it too soon. The woman, who now is like a figurine on a trapeze with glorious beads all over her, is demonstrating different patterns and positions. I am impressed. The man is kneeling at the side of the couch near me as we were in mid conversation and interrupted. She says, "I'd like to kiss you." We'll then see. I say, "You would like to kiss me?" I continue to watch as se shifts into another dazzling display. I'm still trying to form the rest of my explanation to the man while being intrigued by this woman's transformations in crystal beaded color. (292 words)

I am on a boat. I will be traveling for several weeks. I left a place of danger and change. I ask the Captain where my room is. He gives me a number and I walk down narrow halls looking for the room. I open one door and see the back of someone's head. Nope, not my room. I keep walking. The boat is old and wooden. The paint is chipped and peeling. I find my room. It is filled with a couple of old junky metal beds, twin size, and an ugly purple overstuffed chair. Boxes of stuff are laying around, crowded and junky. I start to clean it up. I am sorting piles of papers and so on. I decide to go to the storeroom or the ship's library to get other nicer furniture. I go in and see shelves of video movies. I decide I could watch a movie a day with all this selection. I go back toward the room. Now a man like Chevy Chase likes me. I am attracted to him. I am laying on a berth in a room and I motion to him to come up and join me. He is standing next to a black man and the black man looks confused about whether I signaled for him or for Chevy. I do these elaborate signals to confirm it is Chevy I want. I want to make love to him. Even though we are in a room with other people around and would be exposed. (254 words)

I am traveling on a special highway or freeway where it is electronically fixed so that all vehicles go on it. There are planes and trains and cars. There is no gas and exhaust and so the vehicles are bumper to bumper. I have my face near the muffler of the vehicle ahead of me and not fumes. It's great. I think we are headed for Mexico. Ginny is around, helping me out. I have trouble walking because of the arthritis. She's helping me choose my clothes and helping me change them. Now I'm on a beach and people are feeling very sad for me because of my pain and arthritis. They want to help me. I sit on a blanket. Now a man shows me a rifle. I aim it out toward the surf. People are playing out there. The man says, "Be careful." As a joke, I point and say, "I got one." He says, "What did you shoot?" I say, "A surfer." Now I am with a man who plays music and I have a small snare drum with a crocheted yarn thing on it and I play it with my fingers, making a soft snare drum with a brush sound. He likes it with his banjo music. He asks me if he should sit farther away so people can hear me too. I say, "It's OK if they don't hear me." Now we are in separate cars driving down the freeway and Abner is my helper. I say it'd be nice if we could play the music together, not in separate cars. The music man then finds a tractor and he says, "Look, we can both sit on it." There is another man, an agent for the music man. Now we're on tour in our tractor and I see posters on a wall. One tells how many millions of dollars we've made, because we're so successful. The agent says to Abner, whose name is Roy Ward now, that he should change his name. Someone else famous already has that name. Roy won't change it. It is his name. I look at the posters and say, "Look, other people have acts involving food and music too." One is about cheese.

Abner comes to visit me. I am sitting on my single bed. He comes and sits on it as we talk. Then he tries to come closer and I open the covers and say, "Come on in, it's OK." We lay together, still talking. We cuddle and as we talk, he lays down the opposite way and pulls me on top of him. I am sitting up looking down at him. We are talking about the V family. I say to him, "I'll probably spend the rest of my life thinking about how the V family has influenced me." The dysfunction and the ways they taught us we were not good enough through negativity. Then I say, "You don't agree with me, do you? You don't think they were bad?" He says no, he doesn't agree. I say, "I know they meant no harm. I love them and always will, but the style of communication was negative and nonsupportive." He shrugs and says he doesn't agree. Now he gets up. Somehow the nearly sexual postures we'd been in feel uncomfortable for him. He walks around. (185 words)

I'm in the old west and there is an gang, all men and one woman, two old men leaders. They'd worked together for a long time. Now there is some discussion about change. Should we keep everything the same or change things, a remark about whether this man would play with the dog on the right side, where it always had been, or whether he'll be in the fire, if it is moved to the other side, or if we'll be in the 60's (which is new times). Now they have some respect for each other. They sit around and one man says to the woman, "You've changed. You're better at your job now." They take turns complementing each other. There had been friction when they all started. The old guy, like Harry Morgan of Mash, starts to feel sad and he goes off to visit the graves of the two leaders who were killed in the recent fight they were in. He's going to commit suicide and join them. He's on his horse and on the edge of a raging, swollen creek. The horse jumps in and then he jumps in. Now the gang is searching for him. I see the woman with a blind white cane feeling the bank. She's hip deep in the water, carefully searching. The narration feels that she is blind but methodical and will not miss finding the body if it's there. Behind her I see a wooden log in the shape of a crocodile coming up behind her. (255 words)

I'm with this man. We like each other. There's something about Jamaican music. Then we go to a seaside viewpoint and he and a woman are showing me a beautiful view. I am entranced. It makes a semicircle, the waves and the shapes of the rocks under the water. I say, "Oh, it's beautiful. I must get a picture or two." The man smiles. I get out my camera and start to look in the view finder. I open the lens for the widest possible shot to get the full sweep of the circle, but a rock outcropping on the bottom left corner is in the way and messes up the beauty of the shot. I squirm for a better position but can't get around the rock thing. The man asks what's the problem and I explain about how the rock blocks the picture, or unbalances it or mars it. He says, "Well, then, I wanted you to take a picture of the cheerleader girl." I say, "The what?" I look out and see some rock formations that look like mermaids, sort of. I am not enthused about this angle, because it isn't as artistic, but I start to snap one for him. One of the rocks is now alive and is a little girl who wants her picture taken. She bounces around right in front of me and I try to focus, getting a head and shoulders shot and then a closeup of her face. Then I notice some wiggly boxes in different colors coming up on the view finder screen and realize something isn't right with the camera. I hadn't got the little color squares in it and all the pictures will turn out bad. I open my camera case and see that all my squares of colors have fallen out of their black metal frames. What a job this will be to get it all put back right! I start. The little girl is eager to help me. I open the book of instructions. The words are written like they were in a base of stone and spaces are used for punctuation. It describes what color goes at what point in the story. Now I look up and the man is laying about in a spa or hot water hole with an Evangeline hat and silly Evangeline glasses, narrow and to a point on the sides and on a beaded chain thing. He looks cute and silly. I laugh. I know he wants my attention and is impatient. I get done with all this fiddling around. I smile and say something that means, "This is just like when you were working (maybe a musician or actor) and I waited for you." He acknowledges the hit. I say, "I'll try to hurry." I get to the next part of the story. It doesn't seem to apply to the colors thing. (482 words)

Arnold Swartzenegger is in the water, like an ocean, and a woman is swimming. He grabs her legs by the ankles from underneath and drags her down to drown her.

I go to the ocean and stand on the beach and look out. The water is gone. I am shocked. I see only the foamy stuff left on the sand. This is terrible. Then I turn and walk away. I see a huge bunch of dried bushes pulled together and know this is where the bad guys are hiding. I torch the dry bushes and burn the bad guys out of it. Now they are coming at me and I have a pistol, maybe a .22. I fire bullet after bullet into this one man in a white shirt. He keeps coming at me. I keep firing. I feel bad about having to do this, but I am determined to protect myself. (122 words)

I am at a house at the beach. There is a cute litter of black and white puppies, curly soft fur, like poodles. I pick up a white one and hold him on my lap. I say, "Oh, oh, he's peed on me." Then I look at my hand and see soft, green puppy shit. Ugh. I show it to a man seated on my left. I try to wipe it off. The man puts up his hand to mine and we clasp hands with the puppy shit smooshed up all over both our hands. He smiles. My mother is around somewhere. I say, "Too bad I can't have a puppy at my apartment. But I know I'll take one, only I hesitate, because I'm afraid I'll lose my temper and scream and hit when he makes a mess or is whiny. I don't want to do that ever again and realize this is a way to learn how to do it differently. I decide to go upstairs and look for the stairs. Someone says, "There's this ladder that goes up." I sigh and say, "I can't go up that. Why aren't there stairs where I want to go?" Maybe I'll not go up until I have to, but only, I really want to go up now. So I will do the extra trouble to get there. I go up. Someone has a beautiful bird/butterfly, multi-colored, that flies around my head and sings. She's very pretty. Now I go to the edge of the room and look down, like a counter. The top half of the wall isn't there. I am going to jump down into a box of water. People are laughing; this is just for fun. I have a long skirt and a white long slip on and wonder how I'll make the jump without the skirt flying up and revealing that I don't wear underpants. The girls get in the box and splash around and now the water is all out of it. I scold them and say, "Fill it up again and this time stay out of my water." It is filled up again and I am ready to jump, only I hesitate, because it seems so high up and the water so shallow. Will I get hurt? (382 words)

My father and I are outside on a city street. I point up half a block and say, "There, that's the house I was thinking of buying. I like it." He says, "Let's go look at it." I feel reluctant, like I was just talking about it and not really that interested. I look again, and I say, "Oh, it wasn't that house; that's a church. I meant one further on a block or two." He says, "Let's go." I hesitate. He says, "Is it too far to walk?" I agree it is. Then we are at the front door of the house and ask the woman who lives there, and if we can take a look around. She agrees. We come in and walk through the hall, and turn right, the living room. I look closely at the size of the room and how much furniture fits into it, being aware that I ordinarily do not look that critically at a room and then have a faulty memory of it. I see a large ornate china cabinet, couches and two Christmas trees. An old woman sits in a chair; she is ill. I encourage her. Now I go to the first of three or four bedrooms. It is the old woman's room. There's a single, thin bed, a TV set, a closet. It's crowded, a small room. Next we go to the next bedroom, which is a bit larger. Then we go to the master bedroom, which is huge, beautiful, with lovely furniture, lots of windows, all the curtains matching. I say to the woman owner, "This is a lovely room. My mother is on the tour and asks her when she is moving. She says she has no intention of moving. We go to the next room and more rooms seem to present themselves -- a dining room, a central kitchen. We have gone full circle around the house. I turn back and can see the master bedroom through the window of the kitchen and I see a beautiful fountain, a water fountain. I point it out to my mother, who looks in the wrong direction. I keep pointing and trying to give her verbal direction, but she just can't see it. I say, "By the brick fireplace." She just can't see it. I give up. We leave, thanking the woman owner for the tour.

I am in a living room, apparently mine and my new boyfriend and his 4-year-old son are with me. I am seated in an easy chair trying to clean up the area around me. It seems that lots of Charla's toys and junk from Ellie living there are piled up in the corner. The boy wants to play with his toys, but there is no room until I get the other stuff picked up. Now Ellie comes in and wordlessly starts picking up things. She pulls down the Christmas lights from the wall and other old decorations. It is way past Christmas. This is encouraging. I say I want to talk with her. The boyfriend realizes we need privacy and says he'll go to the other room for a while. Now Ellie and I sit side by side on another couch and I am very angry at her and I am slapping her face, only now Ellie is a tiny baby and I slap her face over and over. Now we decide to go upstairs to my bedroom for more privacy and Ellie leads the way upstairs. It is hard to walk up the stairs and the entry way is a cubby hole, not a door, which makes it physically hard to even get in. Then after we hunch down to crawl through, we have to step on a rickety ladder of sorts built up with like video or CD cassettes in a wooden rack which my boyfriend had built for me. That angers me too. Why did I choose such a difficult entryway to my own comfortable and nice room? [BL] (271 words)

I am someplace where there are many rooms, sort of a house hotel. I carry a bag with a donut in it in my left hand. I really look forward to eating it as a treat. I open it and discover it is a sugar-glazed donut and feel real upset. I want to eat it but am afraid, because of the sugar. I almost decide to eat it but then give it away to the tall, large-chested man who seems to be enamored of me. I look for some other treat. I see a display of baby food jars and think about that, but decide that's too bland. I decide to return to another room where there are fruit-sweetened treats. He follows me. I can feel he really loves me and wants me. I seem to be drawn to him as well. We go into the room and he is showing me a special house he built that is earthquake proof. There is no roof and hardly any walls. I say, "I guess about the only place you can live in a house like this is the Southwest." He agrees. I sigh. I guess I'll have to learn to want to live in the Southwest. We go outside the room and suddenly he kisses me. His big rounded chest is very prominent, and he has to bend forward to be able to get around the chest to kiss me. He starts taking off his jeans. I say, "Please," I feel rushed. He is gently pushing me into the room. He lays down on the bed and asks me to take off my dress. He wants very badly to see my breasts. It is a passion for him that the breasts be the way he likes them. I feel embarrassed, rushed, and also feel his desperate, warm need. So I let him take the dress off as I sit on the bed with him. He pauses to say in a strangled voice of how terrible it is to be afflicted with such a strong need and not know why. I remember then, that he had told me his father had died in his arms, and right after that a large, buxom woman came into the room and comforted him. I realize this is why my breasts are so important to him. I say, "What happens if my breasts aren't right?" He says, "Then I'll love you anyway." He then gently sucks on my breast like a baby. I kiss his arm gently. It is sexually exciting. (425 words)

Ellie comes over with Charla. She says she wants me to baby-sit her so she can go out to breakfast. She seems shy and hesitant. I think, "Well she might, after all we've been through." Ellie comes over to me, her face soft and child-like, and starts to hug me. Then she curls around me and wants to nurse, pulling my breast out of the bra. I am shocked. I say, "What are you doing?" She says something like a 4-year-old child might. She nurses. I know something is very wrong and don't know what to do. I remain calm. The sexual feeling of the nursing is beginning and I know she has regressed to some childhood place and I want to support her, but this is so odd. I can't do much other than tolerate the moment. I try to pat her and lay my arm around her, but I am not genuinely being her mother as a 4-year-old might want. I gently distract her from the nursing. It is clear now Ellie has a severe mental regression problem. Charla is clear and direct and her own energetic self. My mother calls me asking if I'd found the first aid papers yet. I say, "No, I have a real big crisis here and haven't had time to look." Ellie wraps her body around me. I say to her, "You are a 25-year-old woman, with a child. You need to act like one." Ellie doesn't seem to notice, she's so off in her own world. I know I have to have her committed. I'm not sure how to do that. [BL] (270 words)

A "secret pal" came into my rooms the night before and painted lovely mural-like pictures on my walls. They aren't done yet. I am very surprised and pleased. Then Rosemary comes in and I realize it is her art work and she's pretending to have just dropped by. I show her the paintings, yellow in one room and blue in another, designs on the wall, sort of sketched in some places and fully done in other places. I am mildly curious why she chose to do this. It is ironic since she and I haven't spoken since the Mexico trip. Maybe it's a peace offering. Now I have a white dresser with a mirror on it and some pictures I want to take to the sidewalk "Saturday market" kind of thing to sell, only Rosemary has painted part of it blue; thick blue paint. I realize this will make it come down in value. Ironic, eh? Rosemary was trying to help. I decide it was never painted in the first place. The blue disappears and it is pristine white and valuable again. I get it down a full flight of stairs and onto the sidewalk. I place the paintings around it. Rosemary is there with me. Some young college age women come by and are interested. (216 words)

I am at a party with old high school classmates, a reunion. I walk past them and they nod acknowledgment, but we never interact. I feel sad about this. They don't really care about me. Ernie and Ginny are around somewhere. I look in my little purse to find a lipstick. I take out some old glasses and other things and lay them aside. I find somebody else's lipstick and keep it. It has a double tube, only one side of it has lipstick in it. I put it on and look in the mirror. It is bright red, with a black outline partially around the lips. My lips look full and luscious. I decide I like this color better than the washed out pink I usually wear. (128 words)

A man is attracted to me and is trying to get my attention by hanging from a light fixture over a stairwell by his hands and doing tricks. I try to ignore him as I go to my apartment, but he is irresistible and I join him up there. We drop down in an embrace and I look up and say just in time as the square metal box was pulled apart and holding by one screw. We now go up to my apartment. He has moved his things in and a huge black and white bed takes up the entire room with maybe a dozen pillows across it. he turns down the comforter and we get in. He also has maybe four teenage boys. One wants to sleep with us. We laugh and send him on to his room. He goes in and there is bedlam going on in there as they noisily fight. One teen daughter is in there. She's the only nice one. I guess his kids didn't turn out well. Even though he's a wonderful man, his children are ruined. We cuddle up lovingly in the bed. Later, I am coming back to the apartment and a woman stops me and says, "I'm so glad I met up with you. I have the address of a place where you can write. It's one big room, the owner keeps fifty books there in a stack and the rest of the space is all open. If he moves in more books, he'll prorate the rent." She writes down the address, maybe like 219 Ausilaudes. "You don't have to live there," she says. "Just go there each day and write." I agree I need to do that and thank her for the address. Now I'm walking across a porch where small open boxes are displaying segments of a mystery story. I'd been curious to know how this story went, so I walk and look in each box which depicts a scene. "The battery," I say. It was a foreshadowing at the beginning. Now I understand why. My man is being attacked by horrible round organisms that are just a circle of color. They voraciously eat everything. and if he stops emitting this high-pitched noise like a scream, they will close in on him and eat him alive; me too. I am swimming in a lake and they are under the surface, coming at me. I scream and scream. This is an endless struggle. Finally his noise-emitting thing's battery runs out and he is trying to get a new one in. In the seconds while it's changing, they eat him up. I keep screaming and screaming. Finally I am exhausted and simply give up. They decide I shall die slowly and painfully, and I see myself bruised and battered and exhausted, waiting only for the agony to end with death. (480 words)

Charlton Heston is a director on a movie and I am hanging around. He calls me over and asks me to evaluate a scene he is going to shoot. I am very pretty and young. I look over the scene: a pond where groups of men are set up in twos and threes ready to ambush the hero. I notice that they are all attached with a rope. I decide this is a "one," a highly difficult scene, because of all the elements. I tell Charlton and he is pleased with my answer. He is now flirting with me and gently maneuvers me into a quiet room and finds an excuse to shut the door. We chat and I am aware of sexual attraction. I know he is going to make love to me and that he is married, but this is OK with me. I like him and am attracted. He lays down on me and I am pleasantly excited and expectant. We manage to get out of our clothes and so on. It is all sort of innocent and one-step-at-a-time as I watch him maneuver the whole thing. Now I am his assistant director and mistress. It all seems OK and nice. (204 words)

My brother Dwight is dressed up in a nice suit and has received a guitar and a banjo for his birthday. He sits for a moment in a manual wheelchair that is in the room. I comment to him that my father was pleased that he's enjoying his birthday gifts. Dwight asks how I know, since my father didn't say anything. I said, "It was in his face, his expression. I could tell he knew you loved sitting in the wheelchair." Dwight says, "All I did was sit." I say, "I know, but I could tell Dad could tell you loved the gift." Then, as Dwight is making a chair out of the cardboard boxes, the gifts came in by folding them on the perforated lines, I say, "You know, I had a guitar, a mandolin, a fiddle and a banjo." Dwight says, "Really?" I say, "Yes, but I sold some of them." He asks, "Why did you?" I say, "I was poor. I needed the money. I was a student then and on SSI" (Dwight says the SSI word with me like he's heard this story many times). I only got $1450 a month and I had to save $100 a month for the kids, for child support. Dwight says, "It doesn't matter anymore." I say, "Doesn't it?" I clearly think it still matters. (225 words)

Howard keeps a photo of an old wedding. He says the bride is his sister-in-law and his sister a bridesmaid. I look and see that it is Dora's wedding photo. She is the bride and Sonja is the bridesmaid. I look to see where I am. I am off to the far right half, hidden behind other people. Or maybe I'm the tiny one off to the far left. I'm not sure. Now my daughters come to me. Paulina says she belongs to a group called the "Trauma Survivor's Group." Dovre says, "Yes, all three of us have been hurt." I now have to go to Howard and ask him if he ever did anything harmful to the girls. I don't want to talk to him, but I must, to get to the bottom of the situation (story?). (138 words)

I am sitting in a room, watching TV and wearing my bathrobe. Women from the community college, like Charlene B, come in with leftover sandwich fixings from a lunch. They have a leftover sandwich that's "juicy" and full of all the fixings they are giving me. I feel a bit embarrassed about being caught lounging around in a bathrobe and watching boring TV. Now I go into another room and I am talking to a daughter, maybe Jock's daughter Megan. She's sort of my daughter, Dovre, as well. I say to her, "I am a bit worried about Jock." I quickly reassure her that he's fine; it's just that maybe he doesn't really know what he wants to do. She sits up high on a bench up in a corner and moves some of my things off a table so she can eat. It's almost like the place she's sitting is suspended up in the air, half way to the ceiling in a corner. I am a bit annoyed with her for moving my things. (175 words)

I am in a house and the landscape is black and toxic as though black clouds came down and covered the ground. I want to walk over to Dora's house (two or three down the way) and am warned not to walk on the black clouds because they won't hold my weight and they are poison. So I find some cement beams like a curb side and I walk on it to the house. I go in and find Dora vacuuming and cleaning house. I feel a bit uncomfortable and apologetically say, "I've done that kind of thing too, sort of." I look out the window and see a black, toxic cloud sky coming towards us. It fills the entire sky and then suddenly it passes and a brilliant green, fresh spring landscape is there. It is beautiful and I want to go out, but I don't quite trust it, having come from the black cloud formation passing over it. (160 words)

I am having my hair done for an interview on TV. It's a strange hairdo I am given. My hair is black with gray streaks in it, like H's. It is teased up into two big crescent-shaped rolls (not food), sort of 1940's. I am uncertain about whether I like it. I go to the TV station and the man interviews me, taking a lot of the time to comment on my strange hairdo. I am embarrassed, but can't do much about it. After the interview, Hasani and I are going somewhere and I pause at the counter and ask if I'd gotten any mail. Hasani is annoyed and says, Do it later, we have to hurry." (We have a second interview to go to, this is the next morning.) But the woman finds my mail and gives it to me and I am happy to see lots of Christmas cards and letters, lots of them from Amber. She must have given me lots of little things and separately wrapped them, like photos of her kids and so on. I gather the pile up and go to a room where I try to adjust the hairdo to a mere moderate and normal-looking one. I succeed. It's a normal French twist now and a brown color. My three girls are around. Dovre and Ellie sit on my left. Paulina walks outside and I see her face framed in the window by the pretty curtain. There are carolers out there and she joins in. The song is Silent night. It is sweet. Dovre's face is pensive as she listens to Paulina. Now Paulina is inside with us as I am separating the mail into piles on the bed: books here, new books there, letters, coins (lots of them) to the right. I ask Paulina to help me. I say, "Open the letters and put the envelopes here and the letter right next to it in another pile." Then I change my mind and say, "No, it will be easier to find things if you lay the letter on top of the envelope in one pile." She does so, and as she does it, she is trying to sing along with the carolers but sings the wrong words and I correct her. When they sang "mother and child," she sang "mother and mother." When they sang "eternal voice" she sang "voice." It should have been "eternal." (403 words)

I am in a house and there are lots of people there, a party. They are having a great time. I am on the phone talking to Archie I am trying to think of things to say to keep him talking to me. He is annoyed, in fact, angry at me. He says, angrily, "You are better than this, trying to manipulate it so we are alone. I don't like it when you do that. You know better than that." He hangs up on me. I feel terribly hurt and rejected, numbed by the pain of it. I turn and people are cheerfully calling out to me to join the party. I try to respond to them but it is very difficult. I go out to the back yard and something about Charla only having her diapers on. I see her and see she has an outfit of clothes on and looks fine. I comment that she is fine, perfectly and properly clothed. Her "mom" and "dad" want to stay at the party and I want to leave, to be alone. I tell them they can stay as long as they want. The "dad" says, "But she only has one diaper. We'll only be able to stay as long as it lasts." I shrug; not my problem. I try to leave. I feel weighted down with the sadness of Archie's rejection.

I am in a cabin way up in the mountains. I love it there, alone and with all the free time in the universe to think and write. Charla comes to visit and very much wants to stay with me. I love her company but it is time for her to go back to town, with a woman who I know (but only in the dream). I love her and I want my alone time. She clings to me, hugging me ferociously, pleading. I try to soothe her, reminding her we will be together again. She cries as I walk her to the car. I am holding her in my arms and she is clasping me with both arms and legs. I put her in the back of the station wagon car with lots of other things. Now a man (like Claude) loves me. We've had time together and now he must go back to town for the week. He kisses and hugs passionately. I love it, but I also want my alone time. He says, "It's always me that wants it more. You want it, but can let go of it." I sympathize with him intensely, but still know for a certainty it is time for him to go. It is wildly snowing outside, the wind is blowing violently. I caution him to be careful and not get stuck in the snow drift. He does not want to leave. I return to the cabin. There are women in there, talking. I sit apart from them on a couch. (chaise lounge kind of thing). There is some discussion of lesbianism, but I am not attached. Later, I look out at the wilderness. I love it here and there is some concern that a bad man might be out there and I could be in danger. I am not overly concerned, I just notice the possibility. The good man (Claude) is back and we are saying goodbye again, hugging and kissing and murmuring endearments. It feels so good and I feel sorry for him and think of sneaking up on him in the laundry room and making wild passionate love before he has to go. He'd really like it that I initiated it. (372 words)

Lucy, Merle and I are going to do a Birds show. A woman like Julie G comes to show us the way. We look for Lucy. She has taken a moment to check on how the mechanic is fixing her car. We see her in the back seat of a station wagon car, seated sideways, with the passenger side door open. Julie says, "What is she doing?" I say, "She's listening to the engine to see if it's fixed. She'll be along in a minute." We go on to find the room. I go up in an elevator, now alone. I notice the glass wall has a bulge in it like it could break open and leave me exposed to the outside. I get closer to the door, just in case. I get out and ask directions. I am a bit lost and not receiving much help. I find the room. We do the show and everybody likes us. Now I am gathering up my papers and so on to go to another show or lecture situation. We will be late and I realize that even though I had planned ahead and thought I had it all together, my papers are in disarray and I will be late. I am upset with myself. I am in a gas station garage, or what used to be one. I start to leave and have to come back to get the papers. I realize I have trouble being in this space, because of early trauma in a place like it, maybe sexual abuse. I am in a hurry to leave there, something about a baby. A woman is around guiding me. Now I get into the car. We are driving on the freeway. It is Dover and I wonder if it wouldn't be better for the woman to drive as she is familiar with Dover, and I am a bit intimidated by busy traffic; nevertheless, I am driving and I go forward somewhat hesitantly. I notice the traffic isn't as bad as I had thought. I find the right freeway, almost getting on a parallel road and missing the right one. Now I am at the building looking for the poetry workshop room. I go back to where I did the show before and go down a long hall of rooms looking for the place. I notice I'm in the wrong hall. This hall is full of prostitutes hanging out waiting for customers. I (a man now) go to the head madam and say, "Don't you service gays too?" Now I am a woman again and find a group of people in the cafeteria. I ask them where the poetry thing is and a man points to a sign painted on the wall, "Poetry" and an up arrow. We go upstairs and find the room. As we enter, beautiful music comes to our ears and a woman says, "I remember this music. I love it." We enter and I see an easy chair and sit in it. A man wants to sit in it with me and I am hesitant. He slowly comes over and sits with me. We are uncomfortably squeezed together, but it is intimate and the man would like it to be loving. I am unsure. Now a Dr. McCoy kind of man prances around and says that housewives are lucky. They have the house. He goes over to a tableau of plaster statues to point out the house and as he gets in there, one breaks. The crowd is stunned. A priceless work of art is now shattered into pieces. I realize he is a trickster kind of character. I watch as he brings a piece of the face to a woman who had lost a loved one tragically. He says she can...something, maybe relearn or integrate. She holds the fragment of the face and traces its shapes with her fingers and says, "I'll have to have new clothes," and she stands and starts to talk about the face and herself. Meanwhile Dr. McCoy sits in the easy chair with me, like the other man had, and I am crowded and a bit tense. He smiles gently and says, "Let me in." I turn my head and smile timidly up at him and we maintain eye contact. It is beautiful and moving and loving. I am suffused with warmth and love. I touch his arm, indicating I let him in. I lean back into the circle of his love. It is overwhelmingly beautiful and warm. (756 words)

A beautiful woman is married to a powerful man. But she is in love with a Cary Grant kind of guy who is her husband's business right hand man. She throws caution to the winds and is a bit indiscreet in showing her intense attraction to him. He takes her on a flying lesson and the husband (a king of business?) is very jealous. He suspects. Her trusty older woman advisor (secretary?) warns her to be careful. She is devoured by her attraction to Cary. Cary is equally devoted to her. They go off to a house. The king has spies and they are lurking around. Now there is a baby as well. The spies, soldiers, are searching for the baby. The wife realizes she's in danger and so is the baby. She must flee. The older woman takes the baby and hides it. The older woman now deflects the soldiers from the wife so the wife can escape. She takes them to the wife's room and chats as she moves clothes around. There are baby bottles and things around that she tries to hide before they see them. The wife has escaped. She is riding a horse and the crowd is surrounding her. Her hair is long, thick and blonde. She is about to be taken away. But the helper woman has another horse ready for her and she slips off the one and onto the other, the side saddle is covered with a horse blanket. She chooses to ride the "manly" way, astride. Now she rides away and hides in a village. She has changed her name to Maggie, her hair is short and red now. She now becomes intensely infatuated or attracted to a young man, a soldier of the village. It would be safer for her to remain alone, but she can't seem to keep away from this "fatal attraction," the same mistake she made before. They sit together at a campfire. (326 words)

I am in England. I apply for a job as a counselor or facilitator at a house for the severely disabled. I note there is not elevator and a full flight of stairs to get to the bedrooms. I talk with the owner of the house, an older woman. She says there is a bedroom downstairs I could use. They are glad to have me there. A man, a professional man like a lawyer, lives next door, across the street. He comes over and is impressed with me and likes me. I want to show off my skills for him. My parents are in the background somewhere. So I have the disabled kids form a circle. I am working with a boy named DJ or something like that. He can't speak but manages to respond to me with his eyes or a subtle movement where he seems to get closest to me somehow. This is progress. I ruffle his odd, two-toned blonde hair which is partly pretty and partly coarse. I compliment his pretty hair. This makes him feel good. I am being successful. (184 words)

I am a busy traveling professional, on the circuit. I am tired and go to bed. A nice man who is there, one of many, to help me, is in bed with me. I am a bit uncomfortable, but curl up on the pillow and try to sleep. As I lay there, he becomes interested in sex. His hand starts exploring my breasts. I keep my eyes closed and think I hope he can find where they are (meaning I am embarrassed that my old age has made the breasts sort of slide off to the side.) He is hesitant and then moves on. Now he kisses me. I am thinking, "Oh oh, now what do I do?" when I notice it is pleasant. Each step is pleasant and we end up making love. His penis is short and stubby. I stroke it with my hand and he says in a gasp, "Are you sure you should do that? I'll only last about two minutes that way." I smile because I realize I want it to last longer. He says to me, "I am surprised you allow me to make love to you, you're a professional and important and I'm just an old boy from Texas." I say, "But you are a nice old boy from Texas. You are kind to me." I smile and say, "Lots of them have asked, but you're the one who is really nice to me." (241 words)

I am on another planet. An alien and I are comparing notes about relationships and love making. He hands me cards like 3.5 floppy disks with symbols on it and he is interpreting them to me. He says for them, they just spontaneously fall in love. If the one they love is gone or doesn't reciprocate, they have the joy of suffering the unrequited love. It is an honor and a joy to live with this all your life. As we are talking, he is struggling to withhold from me his sudden spontaneous love for me. Then he lets it shine out and I am startled and overwhelmed. He shines in his intense love of me. He thanks me for the opportunity to suffer this great joy. Now I'm teaching him how to kiss. Other officers from his race and mine are upset and then realize this is the best way for our races to become friends and know each other. (161 words)

I am furious at Ellie and we are in a big warehouse-like house with cement walls and large empty rooms. I see a leak near the wall and yellow urine-like liquid is coming in and filling up all over the floor. I go from room to room and realize the decay and mess this place is in. A train goes by and the back rooms tremble as if they are about to collapse. I come back out and slap Ellie repeatedly on her face. I am filled with anger and know I shouldn't be doing this, but don't want to stop. I hit her and hit her, calling her stupid and lazy. I feel no remorse. (116 words)

I return home after being gone for a few days. Dovre and Ellie are there, Ellie is a young adult, Dovre is maybe 7 or 10 years old. I ask several times, "Where is Paulina?" They don't answer and finally I get worried. I demand to know where Paulina is. Ellie flirts with a young adult native American man, pulls his waist belt and they walk off. I realize Paulina is in trouble and Ellie is refusing to answer to me. I yell at her and demand to know. She just leaves with her man. I realize she is going to marry him and I don't even care to rescue her. My concern is Paulina. I ask Dovre who finally says Paulina is in the hospital and so is Charla because Ellie abandoned them without food or water or help. I am appalled. I walk and walk down the city streets looking for the hospital. Dovre comes with me. I ache and hurt terribly and am driven to get to my girls. I get there and walk down hall after hall until I'd gone full circle and found the admitting office, which is right near the nursery. I look in to see Charla as a tiny baby, maybe two years old, screaming in fear as a nurse tries to work with her. I also see a baby girl with a huge extended vulva and scratch marks on her little thin legs near the pelvic region. I realize she's been sexually abused. I want to rescue Charla but must find out about Paulina first. I ask about her and they tell me the room she is in. They want to know where I've been and why wasn't I around when the girls needed me.

I am in a car and tiny blood sucking vampire bats are filling the car. I tell the woman driving, "Keep driving and turn on the light." I try to shoosh them out the broken windshield on the passenger side. I am sort of in the back seat. One little fuzzy bat grabs onto my hand and sucks blood. I feel nearly overcome by sleepiness. This is very dangerous, because if I fall asleep, it will suck me dry. I try desperately to stay awake and turn on the light. (90 words)

Patricia comes up and says, "Quick, get dressed, the Merton Circle is meeting again." I'm trying to get into a dress which is tight and I realize it's a plastic sack. I'm not able to complete dressing. A man who loves me comes by. I hold a wee baby and exclaim how very sweet it is and want to keep it. I hold it tenderly. I now walk with the man. His love for me is intense and undeclared. I lean into him showing him the baby and he is overwhelmed by his love for me and can barely refrain from embracing me. I innocently tell him about a conversation with a woman I had where I wanted to keep the baby, but she told me I shouldn't because a man loved me, I just don't know it yet and I should be open and ready for his love. This nearly overwhelms the man in his love for me. He wants to declare it and is afraid to. (168 words)

I am moving to Alaska to collect my inheritance. Some old woman relative died and left her estate to me. A lieutenant, tall, good-looking and muscular, comes to take me there. He is helpful, safe and strong. We are in a taxi and I am tired, having been traveling for some time. We go to a place, a counter where I can pick up my belongings, like a post office or airline place. I see my things are out of their package, and I ask the clerk if she has a large garbage bag I can use to put the loose things in. She doesn't understand at first, then gives me a padded one. I tiredly ask what the return address is on the baggage, so if any of my stuff got lost, it would be sent there. She says some long strange name with lots of "W's" in it. I am upset. That is my ex-husband's address. How tricky of him; now he'll get my things. How unfair. I drag my stuff to the taxi and sit in the back seat with the lieutenant. I cry on his shoulder; he likes me and is sympathetic, but a bit distant. Perhaps he's afraid to be clear about his feelings, it might make me more upset. We get to the town and I say, "You won't like this, but I've forgotten to get my suitcases. They're at the bus depot. I only have the clothes on my back." We get out. The estate looks kind of small and tacky. There are a line of small, tacky cabins on the front part of the property, facing back to the one on the hill, a steep, dirty hill. I want it to be better and will it to be better. Now we go in and I see room after room, all of them in the wrong places. A bathroom first, a kitchen and the living room off in the back of the house. I want it to all look spacious and rich, and manage some ornate furniture. I go out to the back where a curtain is across the back full wall window. The corner of the curtain falls a bit and I see a beautiful view. I go out on the patio, a wooden deck and admire the mountains in the background. Unfortunately, right next to my property is a wire fence and a bunch of large construction trucks and tacky, bare dirt. Behind a wall is a small, covered swimming pool. I say to the lieutenant, "Oh, this must be the one warm day of the year. I suppose (it's September) that that cold season (I couldn't remember the name for Fall) is starting tomorrow. His back is to me as he's looking out over the vista. He says, "This is Juneau, it's warmer here." I say "Oh, I forgot, this IS Juneau." We go back inside. A cold, well-dressed woman comes in; she likes the lieutenant and doesn't like me. She hands me a book that will tell me about the woman who left me the estate. I see a 1920's cupie doll kind of face, on the book cover. There is some mystery here, some sadness, she got used somehow. Now an old butler speaks, but I don't see him. He introduces himself as the old retainer and will be happy to stay on and with his wife the cook and so on. I hesitate, it sure would help, but I ask, "How much do you charge." The woman implies I shouldn't worry about it, I've got a pretty good deal here, with the estate. Maybe it's all paid for. (611 words)

I am alone in a space ship millions of miles out in space. I see another space ship. It is probably an enemy. I am laying on a sort of gymnastic leather "horse," staring up at the ceiling which has lots of toy wooden whirligig things. They are colorful. I am in suspended animation and struggle to awaken when two large, ominous-looking men beam into my spaceship from the alien one. One is bearded, black-haired, tall and muscular. I don't know if they are dangerous or not but decide to get them out of there just in case and mentally will them beamed back. I manage to do it. Now I must maneuver the spaceship cleverly to evade them. I fly under them so that can't get their bearings on me. (131 words)

Maren and Ellie and the younger set are there. They believe in fundamental religion and the Bible and I am going to debate them about reincarnation. I am walking around a large house with lots of interesting floors and no walls that I am aware of. There is a dirty water channel around the house like a moat. Dangerous fish monsters are in there and if you swim in it to get to the other side, you are eaten alive. As I am walking from room to room, I pass two young, leather-jacketed men, teens really, and I am exclaiming how wondrously beautiful the world is, shimmering, sparkly beauty. They approve of me. Not many people notice. I walk up a path and see a large green lake on the left. A man is laying down on the edge of it looking at it and saying, "How pretty." I say, "But cold. It is fed by glaciers." He doesn't believe me. I say, "Stick your hand in, you'll see." He does and it is very cold, like ice. Someone remarks, "This lake has been many places," and I ask, "How can you move a lake around?" I go back into the house area. Maren has returned and is interested in debating me about reincarnation. Then I realize she means to quote to me from the Bible to argue against me. A man comes to me and says, "I want you to see the new water." I am impatient but follow him. He takes me to the dangerous channel. He wants us to cross it and see the new water over there on the other side as well. I look at the channel and see it is blue and solid, with a thin water layer over the blue solid "floor" laid over the channel. He says to the keeper of the gate, "We want to cross." The gate keeper is nervous. The man says, "I'll hold back the bear." I watch as the gatekeeper is trying to open the valve to let the crossing be safe as a huge bear is trying to eat him. The man is wrestling with the bear, holding him at his huge, gaping mouth. The bear has stretched his neck out long like a dinosaur's neck. It is overwhelming, but the man barely manages. Now a couple walks across the channel and I, in a prom dress, nervously step across. I am worried it will give in and I'll fall in with the monsters. We get across. The couple goes to the meadow and walks away; the meadow has that same thin film of water over it. The man says, "We'll go up higher. Push that button." "What button?" I ask. "That one," he says. I see two. "Which one?" I ask. He laughs and says, "This one, right in front of me." I look over and see a button he is looking at. I step over and push the button and a small square platform I am standing on begins to go up and the man steps off. "Aren't you coming?" I ask. "No," he says, "the platform isn't stable enough for two. Sit down, he says. "What?" I say. He says "Sit down, it's safer." Now it's going very high up and I sit, facing the mountain cliff we are rising up, very aware there are no walls and I am afraid of heights. I concentrate on looking at the solid cliff and not to look down. I get to the top, but the fun has gone out of this as I am alone and the man isn't there. I look around and then return back down. Now I see the water has returned to its original brown, murky dangerous way and realize I can't get back home. The man is over there. I ask, "What happened?" He says, "We couldn't hold it. It disintegrated." I am very distraught. Now a woman, sort of me, but I am watching, dives in and desperately swims to the other side hoping she makes it before the monster fish get her. She almost makes it, but a huge brown fish comes out from under the bank and pulls her back under by the feet. She is dead and gone and eaten. I stand on the bank, knowing I can't go home and wanting to. Somehow I do manage to cross and return. Now as I am walking on the floors, I step hesitantly, half expecting the floors to have soft watery spots I can sink into and be eaten alive by the fish monsters. (767 words)

I am at a V. family reunion. It seems odd, because I thought we just had one and now it's next year already. My Aunt Esther is there, as young and pretty as in her prime, maybe early 20's. Her hair style is very 1940's and luxuriant. I remark how pretty she is. I want to tape things good this year and go get my video camera. I find the camera and the cord, but no batteries and no tapes. I desperately search and find other kinds of tapes, but not for the camera. The aunties are seated around an old oak dining table and are starting. The room is empty except for them and the table. The kids are playing in another room. I try to remember what they say and how they talk. Now I am very sleepy and lay down on the foot of a bed, apparently in another room. Katrina is laying on the bed and I move my head so I don't lay on her feet, but she gently replaces my head on her feet so I'll be more comfortable. I am so sleepy that I continue to not respond and she takes a pillow and places behind my knees and gently moves my legs so they will be straight, as it is bad for me to sleep all curled up. My joints will stiffen that way. I start to slip and I slide right off the bed and onto the floor. Then I get up. I'm hungry and go to find the cookies in the kitchen. I see lots of different kinds of cookies but not the kind I like (chocolate chip). I also see a chest of drawers and I rummage around and see jewelry and books and things. I try to organize them. Now I go outside. I've apparently been exercising and gaining strength and now I go down a ladder, wearing sneakers and a jogging suit and attempt to walk on the beach. I am elated. It's a dream come true. I see the waves at the surf's edge, the foamy white little waves and happily walk in them, feeling strong and vigorous. I look out to the sea and notice a breakwall with the ocean beyond it and then a wave about hip deep sweeps over me and I enjoy that, but am now a little concerned. I look again and realize a tidal wave is coming and I turn and run for higher ground. It roars over me and I am dragged and then deposited on a wooden fence-like thing. I hang on and look again to see even a bigger wave crashing over me. I hold my breath and go under. It recedes and then I see bird like dinosaurs, huge and non-thinking, eating the running and screaming people. I hide down behind a wooden fence, in the grasses, between rocks. My little girl is with me and I hug her to me. The dinosaurs pass over me and sniff, they kind of know I'm there and can't find me, but are getting very close. Another wave comes over. I hang on, hoping desperately we'll be safe. They eat more people. Now I peek out at the ocean and see it is running sideways. The current is like a river and huge plumes of exploding water funnels come up and dissipate. Something is very wrong. A dinosaur reaches his head over where I hide and is sniffing very close.

I am traveling somewhere and see a beautiful vista and want to stay and take pictures. My lens isn't clean, so I try to clean it but it only smudges more. I struggle and struggle. I decide I need to find a photo shop to get it repaired and I decide to spend the night in this little resort town, in the mountains. Now the scene shifts and I am being initiated into the army kind of a thing. I am going to be whipped by the men as I pass. I carry my own whip and I fling that whip around so quickly and strongly that they can't hardly get near me. After this, I am given a sign that says, "I have balls" and another sign that says, "I am a bird that birds love." Now I go on up the mountain. A narrator sort of describes how some people meet with bad times and some with good times. I see a tidal wave coming and a woman is killed by it. I see a man, a family member of mine standing at a spot where the tidal wave uncovers a wall of gold bricks (like pyrite crystals sort of). I am rich. (205 words)

I am wheeling down the sidewalk, going to the You Can Gym to workout. I see a young woman with dark hair in a wheelchair. She greets me and says, "You come by here often now." I say, "Yes. I workout a lot at the You Can Gym." Eric comes up smiling happily to see me. His hair is full and curly. He wears a spiffy suit. He says, "Have you seen my wares?" He refers to a box of ceramic things he is selling. A man is there and Nate is trying to do the salesman thing, very positive and creatively trying to get the man's interest. It isn't working, the things aren't all that terrific and the man doesn't want them. Nate seems to be trying to impress me. There is a black kitten, like my furry pouch in there somewhere. Now I see Dora. I have two paper plates with a squishy, messy paper napkin in between the inverted plates. I use it like a shutter bulb on a camera. The thing is my camera. I want to take a picture of Dora. She hides down behind a plate glass window barrier and is squatting. She is going to take a good healthy dump and says, "Hey, don't take a picture of this." She says it's going to hurt and she will have to push hard, but it will be worth it and she'll feel good after it is done. The pain is like the bearing down pains of childbirth labor. (254 words)

I am with Mirabelle. She is in the garage looking around and complaining that Ellie has left the clothes in the washer and a mess all over. She says, "Can't she see what needs to be done?" I am annoyed at her and say, "No, that's the point, she can't see what needs to be done, so she is unaware of what she must do." I walk back into the house and now am experiencing some terrible gut pain. A personal assistant dark-haired woman is smiling at me and solicitous. She insists I get up and sit on the piano. I don't want to, but I do. I am crouched over my belly, kneading the painful spot and the woman is smiling and suggesting I relax and so on. I am angry at her and deep in the pain and I let the pain be there on my face; I don't hide the pain. I groan and say, "Yes, I'm in pain, terrible pain." I start to crawl off the piano and ask Mirabelle to give me an arm for balance. I step off onto the foot pedals of my old wheelchair and ease down off the piano. Mirabelle is being very helpful and lecturing me that I should tell that woman what I think and feel about her treatment of me. I'll feel better when I do. I am now angry at Mirabelle because it is her, not the other woman, that I want to say "back off." So I say angrily, "I am telling my feelings. I want you to leave me alone." She gets sarcastic and smiley like I'm mistaken. I say, "Let me get around you" (a narrow hall). I push my way around her. (289 words)

I am on a Dream Bus. A group of us are doing a dream workshop on the bus. It's a bit hectic and crowded. On my right sits a man I like and he likes me. He is sweet-faced and kissy. He's new to all this and asking some questions about the workshop. He asks, "Where's the Merton Circle?" I point over across the way to a group of people with their backs to the front of the bus and pointed away from us. I say, "There they are." I am a bit surprised they do not include me. I notice they are watching a TV, monitor of the presentation we are seeing from the front main screen. Now this man and I move up front to a two-seater bench and are cuddling. The boss of the trip, a loud belligerent man, comes up and starts giving orders and so on. I feel defiant and I ask him deliberate questions and make direct statements that he doesn't want to hear. Other people are nervous and waiting for me to get nailed for being so uppity. I feel this freeing sensation of power. I'm telling the truth as I see it and to hell with the consequences. Now the crowd in the bus is chaotic and noisy and he's trying to control it and I make suggestions and try to control it. It doesn't work, of course. I'm trying to prioritize the three tasks that are needed to be accomplished. One task is to check and see who really belongs on the bus and throw the imposters out. The second is to get them to cooperate and not be such a milling, noisy crowd and then the third is some woman's wish to sweep the bus up with her broom and tidy things up. (303 words)

I am walking up some steep stairs to an attic storage room to see what the guys have stored up there. There are rows and rows of soda jerk equipment, and way in the back a bedroom for a man. It is rickety and the railing is loose, and Pete P wants to protect me. He has a bed sheet and is trying to lay it against the railing side, so I have something to hang on to so I won't fall. By the time I make it back down, he has it arranged. I'd gotten down by myself with him trying to help, but not really being helpful. He comes to me and hugs me gently and lovingly. He loves me. Then I start to realize he is transforming. He is black with red eyes, an entity and I am afraid. (142 words)

I am in a ward with physically and developmentally disabled people. They are wandering around crazy like. It is scary. I don't fit, so I go to the next room where the intelligent crazies are. They are men. I hang out with them. I am crazy too, I guess, or I wouldn't be there. I get a phone call from Derek. The line is static and hard to hear, and then the crazies are being noisy and I keep trying to understand what Derek is saying. He's trying to explain about his Chevy. Then he is angry at me and gets sarcastic, "Being in the head B. Just can't get in the heart, huh?" I say, "Stop it. Stop it." "Just tell me, B, I need you to be in the heart and I'll happily go there. I feel attacked and put down when you ride me about it." He is so distant with the static. I feel frantic trying to connect with him. [BL] (164 words)

Derek is gone. He's taken off. I'm in a room with a lot of cops. They are a group of bad cops and my group is putting the sting on them, to bust them. I'm yelling, "Get in that auditorium room, NOW!" We've cut off their communications with their organization. They're laughing at us because they're the ones with the power, but somehow we surround them and they go in and I slam the door shut. I walk to each one. One dark-haired man is lying on the floor. I pick up his head by the hair and yank him around, saying as I do it, "This is what you did to the patients." Another man I kick in the groin and belly saying, "And this is what you did to them." We have them arrested and taken away. Now I want to find Derek. I go to the screen door and open it to go outside and two men are standing there. I walk past them, and look and look. I come back in, not having found him. Lisa and another young woman are there. We're talking about my silly boots. I say, "Well, that's the way I wear them, Oh look, it's inside out." Then Derek is back, looking for me, only we miss each other and now he's in his car and driving and I'm in my car and driving. We're on the same road, maybe a car between us, and are unaware we are so close to each other. After driving for awhile, Derek sees that it is me in the car ahead and he speeds up to come up on my right side. He waves at me and I smile and see him and we drive side by side for awhile and find a place to park and we get out, Derek in his chair and me with a walker and we embrace. (318 words)

I am sleeping in a hall on the floor, in a suit of some kind. I wake up to find Ernie standing over me, watching me. I am surprised. I fall asleep again and three times wake up to find him watching me. He's in a blue business suit. He has made a decision. He is going to have me for his second wife. He goes to his wife, and she says, "You've decided to move." He smiles and says, "Yes to Posner" (meaning a town where I live). This sort of is her way of saying she'll go along with his scene of having two wives. Now I am his wife and am about to meet the other woman who will be his other wife. She is a sophisticated woman. I feel shy and unsure about how all this will go. She smiles at me and looks over to where Ernie is standing off in the distance and says confidentially, "He sure dresses badly, doesn't he!" I giggle and say, "Oh yes," and she smiles and says "Well, we'll see about that." I say, "Oh, that's just the way he is. Won't do any good to try and change that." She feels confident that she has some tricks of the trade that will fix it. I feel unsure about all this and a bit like a failure because I didn't have any tricks of the trade like that. (239 words)

The actor John Ritter is now sort of the Alan Alda/Ernie guy. He's in love with his woman and there is a short, pudgy, sensitive woman friend. The woman he is in love with and he are very attracted to each other but there some things in the way, maybe other relationships or something, so they are drawn to each other but aren't quite connecting. He touches her face lovingly. They talk. Somehow they are teaching each other by example how to be like the other. The woman teaches John to be more loving and John teaches her how to be more direct and sure and centered. I am with John at a football game. I watch as a play is made on the field. John is calling the shots. He says, "OK, OK, throw a 32." I watch as they throw the ball and John yells, "Low, really low!" Then the ball is thrown up and into a square marked 32. The crowd roars. I say, "Is that a good thing?" He says, "Yeah, it was strategy." Then one of the football players grabs another one and physically picks him up by his feet and his hair and carries him to the referee who sits on a high seat by the goal posts. The guy had cheated or done something unsportsmanlike and he's being taken to the ref for a fine or a reprimand or something. I laugh and say, "Football! Can't they just play the game? What's all this macho stuff?" The crowd shifts uncomfortably, a bit ready to heckle me for having a negative attitude about football. I feel that keenly and snort a bit more sarcastically. They respond one notch more, grumbling and hostile. I say to John, "They do that one more time, I'll do it. I'll just say it." We are on the edge of them booing me and calling me names for being a stupid lady and I'm on the edge of calling them stupid and so on. John grabs my arm and says, "Let's go." We start to leave. Now I am the pudgy woman friend. John's woman tells him his wife/girlfriend is in the hospital. The babies are seriously in trouble. John says, "That's terrible, but what can I do?" She soothes him and assures him it would make no sense to go to the hospital and be there. The pudgy woman is in the elevator and John and the woman are waiting for the elevator. She says to him, "You know, you are too rough on her. You criticize everything she does. Her ass is too big, she doesn't talk right, she should do this and that. It's a wonder she isn't having suicidal thoughts. She just loves you, you know." "I know, "says John, "I wish I could be more like her. She's so caring and sensitive." Now the pudgy woman gets out of the elevator. John somehow shows her the newspaper headlines about the babies being seriously in trouble and she sees this and starts crying and sobbing and running. She must get to the hospital and do whatever is possible to do. She's running down the hall to another elevator, sobbing her heart out. John is filled with guilt and remorse. Why can't he be like that? She is so giving of her love and he is so selfish and self-centered. (564 words)

Mirabelle is walking and we are going to the park and talking about her having a baby. I see I am on a motorcycle racetrack thing, a dirt bike kind of track. I get back on the road. I go to my doctor's office to get my file. I have some questions. I take my file with me. It is full and I realize I never even asked permission to take the file. Now I am looking through the file and decide to call the nurse and tell them I have it. I see the Dream Group is forming in the other room and they are starting the dream work. I want to be in there and realize I don't have to make this call. I hang up. I look outside and see rain clouds, dark, thick, heavy ones all around. It is an ominous, powerful sky. I enter the dream room and suddenly I am consumed by a fierce, powerful force. It wells up from within me. I am expanding, ferocious and somewhat alien. Claude sees this and stands back in awe. I am all powerful and I grab his shirt front and pull him up to me (he was sitting on the floor) and say, "I'll make love to you later." I plop him back down and survey the room. (222 words)

I'm in a room talking with three volunteers for MIUSA. One woman is from England, another woman from India and a man from perhaps Australia. The woman from England introduces herself and says, "We should get acquainted. Let's take a coffee break." I am distracted because far off in another room a man is sleeping. He had proposed something to me, perhaps relationship. He had offered me a ring and I had refused it but I am fascinated and want to go get the ring. So I keep putting the woman from England off with excuses about being busy, or it's too early to take a coffee break and so on. She persists. Finally, I say, "No. You go on ahead without me." They do. Now the man is saying he has a pager, do I have a pager? I say no. He says, "I'm trying to collect as many things as I can for when I go back home." He leaves. Now I drive my chair quietly to the far off room where the man is sleeping. I sneak up on him hoping I don't wake him. I open a small box and find the ring in a black pouch. I also find another ring of mine and an amethyst crystal. I gather up these things and sneak back out. I go back to the room I had been in before and open the pouch to examine the ring. I am drawn to the ring and to the man but I am hesitant. There's maybe some Howard energy around the man. (262 words)

I am at a man's house. It's Derek and yet not quite Derek. It is a potluck. Carlene and Pat are there, Brian and Megan, and perhaps some others. Brian says it's time to go and offers to give Carlene and Pat a ride, as I had brought them. They all leave and Derek and I are alone. It feels very exciting and promising. Derek is showing me around his house. He has a photo album open on the floor and I easily lay down on the floor to see what's in it. Derek is standing and walking into the kitchen and back to where I am. I am aware that both my being on the floor and his walking are not really possible. I look at the photos and say with some respect and awe, "Hey, these are like Steven Spielberg's special effects." "Yes," he says. "Did you use special equipment or machines?" "No," he said, "I did it with perspective." And he points out how something in the foreground and something in the background are sized to make a unique perspective. I am very impressed and then realize these are far better than any of my photos. I say, "Maybe I shouldn't show you any of my photos." He agrees. I feel a bit hurt. I need to go to the bathroom and he says, upstairs. I walk up a long flight of stairs, realizing this should be difficult to impossible, but I'm doing fine. I find the bathroom. As I come back out the bathroom into a hall, I see an older woman and several younger women talking, perhaps about me, in whispers. I now am passing the open bedroom door of Derek's bedroom, on the left at the top of the stairs. I can't resist looking in and am specifically looking to see what kind of bed he has. It is an ordinary double bed and I am glad. It looks inviting. I go fast down the stairs, which are lined with books along the wall. I go so fast I almost skip stairs and trip myself up. Derek walks toward me, his sexy eyes clearly indicating he is sexually interested. I feel warm and responsive. But somehow, we are taking things to the kitchen and we go down another flight of stairs to a big open space. I look again for a bathroom and find a huge public bathroom and can't find the toilets. I ask a clerk at a window and he points to a room. I go in and it's a communal bathroom. I pee, somewhat self-consciously as the door is open and people are wandering through. I come back out and now am back in the living room and lying on the floor again. Derek walks over and lies down beside me and pulls out a condom and just shows it to me. I look at it and then at him and he smiles like a clown and makes shapes out of the condom, a mushroom shape and other things like a balloon clown would. I feel shy and sexually excited and he looks over at the stairs invitingly. I go to the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, I sit down and he comes over and kisses me, lying down on top of me saying, "If you don't want to do this, now is the time to tell me." I want to do this and kiss him passionately, sexually aroused. (580 words)

An alien female is transforming me. I am lying down in the front seat of a car. I am very afraid. She starts at the top of my head and as she slowly moves down to my feet, my bones and body change somewhat painfully, being pulled into another shape. I am now Eva Saint Marie, blonde, beautiful and elegant. My task now is to go to an audition. It is a small coast town and the local community theatre is putting on a play. The director has some important contacts in Hollywood and somehow I, the dream ego, knows Eva will be the right one. Eva goes in and he sees her and instantly knows she is the one. She is elegant, a certain aura or presence that indicates how very special and talented she is. He comes to her right. He is huge, twice as big as her, and puts his hand on her knee. He says, "Act sexy." She takes his hand off her knee, looks him in the eye, and then tosses her hair around and looks sexy. He says, "You've got the part." She's on her way to stardom. Now she/I goes to her home. She doesn't recognize it as the alien arranged this all, but she knows it's her new home. It is a small cabin behind a big house, very simple and economically furnished, a small refridge, a bed. A man and a small girl live there. They are her family, I guess. They simply are there, living, waiting as she goes out into the world. (263 words)

Only our faces are turned toward each other. The bodies are not turned to lie up against each other. I miss that connection and so does he. He says, "Let's lie down," and we lie down together on a table. We kiss and feel sexual desire, and start to make love. Some angry girl is watching. I'm going to get in trouble. I leave and the next day I am telling a group of people that I spent the day doing something else, in an attempt to protect Dr. Fleischman.

There are twin babies and they both shit their diapers. I lay them both down on the floor and start to clean up the one on the right. The one on the left is annoyed and says something about not liking to be last. I try to tell it that I'll get to it as fast as I can. I get the diaper off and the butt is really disgusting with runny shit. I wipe and wipe but there's more and more, and in frustration I pick the baby up and take it to the sink and wash it under the faucet. It is nicely clean now. (107 words)

I have a huge house and my parents are there somewhere. I have invited several women to stay a while and they and their sisters from a sorority are moving their stuff in. I had seen them on the sidewalk looking for a place to stay. I say to my mother, "Not all these women are staying." Meanwhile two men are moving in. They want to know where to put their cereal. I show them the shelves, "The bread here, the desserts there." My father is concerned there will be so many people there will be no room for us comfortably. I point out this is a big house. The women will live on the top floor. There is, I realize, another huge recreation room complete with kitchen down the hall, so our nuclear family setup won't be over run. I see an alcove and am looking for a place to set up mailbox, pigeon holes in a desk and a hutch. I open a drawer and see kids' toys. At first I try and hide them from Charla so she won't come mess them up and lose them. Then I tell everyone, "This is the playroom and everyone needs to be responsible and put away each game after they are done and be sure not to lose pieces." Then I feel OK about leaving them there, as several adults are there to supervise and I don't have to be responsible. (241 words)

I am in bed with Aunt Rosalie and her face looks like mine. Uncle Gus comes over and sits on the bed and I watch Aunt Rosalie's face as she is obviously in love with him and she looks at him so lovingly and wistfully. I confront Uncle Gus, who looks young, and good-looking. I say, "Did you molest me?" He looks surprised I would ask that and avoids answering. I say, "Then did you do it to other cousins?" He hems and haws. I then say, "Well, you did it with Darcy." He accidentally agrees. I've caught him. Then does that mean he did it with me too? He worms around and puts his arms around Aunt Rosalie who seems to only be focused on wanting him. (128 words)

Derek and I are like counselors for two groups. He's with one group and I'm with another. I want to spend time alone with him, but that's impossible. I try to get our groups together so they can help each other out. I see an old man/tiger wandering around a bit lost. I call Derek over to see him and enjoy the pleasure of watching a human struggling with their process. He comes over and we both look down a flight of stairs. The tiger lies on his back and I see he's becoming sexually excited by a young woman. Several strings come out of his penile sheath. I encourage him to go look for a woman to have sex with. He then decides to look around and find one. Now I see Derek and move him to a room where we can be alone. He and I are both standing and I lean on him and hug him, wanting to make love. He stands tall and distant and it is clear he is not interested in me sexually. I am very hurt and run from the room crying. I want to run far away where he'll never see me again and I will cry and cry. But I choose to go to the house next door where his group originated. Both these houses are rotten and old and in bad disrepair. I go in, careful to step so I don't fall through the floor. I know he'll find me soon. I cry. (253 words)

I go to a street corner to meet Derek and friends. We're going to a potluck or the park or something. He wheels up, and I hear a narrative voice saying he paid $160 to help his friends get food ready and maybe they won't show up. I feel bad for him, going to all that trouble for possibly nothing. It doesn't seem to bother him. He wheels up and we greet each other happily. I am holding a sweet baby and cuddling her. Now we're going to go on and go to the park and continue, friends or no friends. I am walking and become aware that this is a dream, because I don't ordinarily walk. Realizing this, I decide then that he can walk too and he is now walking. I see his tennis shoes all stiff like, but then he is walking. We are entwined, my arm around him and his arm around me. It is close and intimate and warm. Then, he's back in his wheelchair and invites me into his lap. I and the baby curl into his lap and we laugh and hug. Now we're at the table and I feed him "his food" and he feeds me "my food," one forkful. He only eats half of it and I pause, thinking about possible germs, and then shrug and finish off the bite.

My mother decides to ride in my wheelchair to see what it's like, with me. She sits on my right side and I must carefully turn off the joystick so she doesn't accidentally push it and we careen off out of control. I want her to sit on my left side and we're on the wheelchair lift and it is going up and down out of control and I'm calling out to two children playing and to my father and another man, perhaps my grandfather, "Help. This is an emergency." I am getting more angry. They do not pay any attention. Then I realize I'm sitting on the lift control panel and am making the lift go up and down myself. I stop it and we go down and I drive off the lift. (134 words)

I am in a room with a large wall window. A woman is on the other side. She has pages and pages of lists of songs, by the decade, and is going through the list with me. We're looking for songs we like. Bill Cosby comes in from a door at the left and is deftly "playing" the wall, like it is a piano keyboard. Then he plays the keyboard to the right of the wall, under the window. It is a complex piano piece like the flight of the bumblebee. I am impressed and ask him how he does that, on the wall. He shows me some intricate hand moves that simulate a piano sound. I call to the girls upstairs to come see Bill Cosby. They come down, but he is gone and they are disappointed. Now a group is going to the concert and a guide or two is there to show us how to walk across the ledge of stones, a thin row of stones across a vast precipice. It's a scary walk, but we are doing it. Suddenly a young person falls off, but surprise, the guides are quickly down at the bottom to catch them, so no one is hurt. No one can get hurt even though it seems a dangerous walk. Now I go up a hall, up a few stairs to a small room, in the Hult, Studio One, it is called. Small baby children are playing an elaborate pipe organ-like instrument with their adult helpers. It's pretty, maybe Mozart, but not the concert I came to see. I move on in search of another room. I find one where adults are doing the same kind of music. Now I need to go to the bathroom and find a stall. It is a mess in there. There's a toilet, a pediatrics commode, all shitty, and a pool of urine on the floor. I don't want to touch anything. A woman pops her head in and apologizes for the smelly commode. I try to pee in the pool on the floor without dragging my clothes in it. It is difficult. I decide to leave. (361 words)

A little girl is getting ready to go to school. Her mom and others are fussing about making everything just right. She has an elaborate hat and dress on. A little boy, her brother, is feeling neglected. He plays a card game and runs away to get attention. No one at school likes the little girl and a woman, like Aunt Naomi, says, "Maybe you are just trying (working) too hard." She takes the hat off and turns the dress inside out so it isn't so fancy. I, the dream ego, think, "Boy, what an amazing coincidence. The dress is reversible like that and no ugly seams show" Now the boy has run away and someone on a huge motorcycle is taking him for a ride. The motorcycle has a canopy on it. Later, I (adult) get on a motorcycle to go find him. My mother is riding on the back and I keep trying politely to get her off. I'd say, "Here's a nice place you could stay," and she'd say, "Why would I want to stay at a place that looks like an aircraft carrier?" (a huge apartment complex). I take the wrong turn. I go the left fork. My mother says, "The gravel looks different here." I say, "You're right." I made the wrong turn and I go back to the fork to go down the right fork. I had intuitively felt it was the right way, even before my mother spoke. (245 words)

Derek kisses me. I am disappointed because his mouth is hugely wide and it doesn't feel good. He French kisses and it is intense, our tongues intricately intertwining. I feel him have an orgasm and I am untouched with sexual passion. It feels very cold and self-serving. Now I am being chased by him and other people. I run for my life. They are gaining on me and then I am backed up to a huge barbed wire fence. I turn and fight hard, without guilt. It is simply necessary to defend myself. I box kick and do karate moves. I force the fence into a man's throat, so the barbed wire is poking his throat. I demand they open the gate. It slides open enough and I dart across "no man's land," a railroad yard, tracks and mud. A "living" box car is trying to run me over as I try to race across the land and over the tracks. It moves like a cartoon creature out to get me. I cross the other fence on the other side and run like hell. The landscape is dismal and frightening. I turn left and am in a hall-like place like the storage unit place. I duck into a storage unit where green plastic upholstered dining chairs from a 1950's style are stored. I sit in one and slide the door partially shut and tremble in terror. [BL] (236 words)

Derek is the king and now I am the queen, only now Derek disappears and I am prisoner in the palace, all these men wanting to control me because of my power. My little girl and I have a secret bathroom we can go to in a house trailer. We have potty bowls. She has to poop, I have to pee. My dress is ornate and formal with the official queen logo on the front. As she and I wander around, I cover the logo and my face so no one will know I am the queen. (97 words)

Bonnie and I are in a pickup truck traveling back home and she stops and grabs a small calf and kills it, throwing it in the back of the truck. She does this a second time, explaining that the baby calf was pregnant anyway and would have died. I am very upset and say to her, 'This is cattle rustling. At least drive away from the door of where you stole it." She drives a ways and parks right in front of an old broken down, rotting house. I hear a mean couple arguing. I want to escape there, but sit in the passenger seat, not doing anything. I see Bonnie use a knife to cut open the pregnant calf. She says, "See, I told you it was pregnant." (129 words)

I am somewhere, supposedly at my place of work, only it isn't. I want to pee and try to in a bowl; it stinks and is exposed. A woman, perhaps Maren, follows me around. I am annoyed. I try to clean things up a bit, wash a dish, move a bottle to the sink. Then I go out into a large warehouse-like area and toward an open door. The woman moves ahead of me. I see the tip of a huge, black, shiny, pretty and dangerous tank. The woman steps out and is killed. I turn and walk back through the long huge warehouse building going toward the back exit. I am aware that maybe I should check and see if the woman really is dead, but that would be dangerous to me. Maybe I should warn other people, but I don't. I decide with a bit of guilt that I will call people and warn them after I get to my office, my place of work. I see cupboards and cabinets and think about hiding in one of them. I realize that is what I usually do in a dream, and decide not to do that this time. I find the back room, where two men are working, stacking wood furniture this company makes. I pass them without a word and go out the back door and around the corner. I look to the right and see the back end of the black tank which now looks like a large fuzzy black elephant, the same kind of fuzzy as my purse. I then run to the left and go up some steps to another building where my office is, only it's not my office and nobody is there and hasn't been there for a long time. [BL] (297 words)

I am at the coast at a seminar thing. A lecturer, a famous man, is preparing to lecture. I've been to several of his workshops and am returning for this last one. I see I'm early, maybe a half hour early, and not many people have arrived yet. It is outdoors and I decide to secure myself a place near the front on the grass. I lay something down on the ground because the patch I choose is a bit muddy. The lecturer tells me to move back a bit, as he'll need more room to conduct the lecture (like a symphony conductor). I move back; I am annoyed. He didn't have to tell me in that cold way; I'm quite willing to be helpful. Now it's over and I and the other women are returning to our home, only when we left home to come to the workshops we were girls and had left our toys out. When we returned, we were women. I start to put away the toys, only I still want to play with them and decide it is OK to keep them around for when I feel playful. Then Ginny calls and says she's booked us for a weekend at the coast to attend this really neat workshop entitled "The forest and the river." "Maybe," she says, "you're all tired out from the last workshop and don't want to go." I say, "No, it's OK." Then we can stay Saturday night and just have fun at the coast the next day. Ginny kind of hesitates, then agrees and I realize maybe she hadn't planned to pay for both nights. (274 words)

I am in a house. Derek is there; it is late at night and I am tired. I go lay down in bed and close my eyes. Suddenly, Derek has transferred into the bed and puts his arm around me and I put my head on his shoulder. It feels very cuddly and restful. He rolls over so he's over me, but not on top of me, and we talk for a while. I fall asleep and then wake up. He is out of bed and in my parents' bedroom looking for something in the closet, something he may have left there, or maybe he's taking money of my parents'. I don't know. Then he is gone.

Charla and Deirdre are both the same age, rambunctious children. They are being noisy and not minding and so I say to them they have to lay down in bed and be quiet for 10 minutes; then they can go play. They simply will not stop. They'd get out of bed or talk and giggle. I am furious. It's a power struggle. I go over and spank them each four times on the butt. This doesn't stop it. I start slapping them on the face, hitting them over and over and insisting they mind. They simply do not understand why I am being this way. I am stone cold angry. I have a point to prove. This is discipline. Mirabelle comes over and talks; she wants me to be lenient. I am angry at her for interfering. An old lady comes by and wants to talk. I am firm and almost rude to her demanding she leave as I have no time for her now. I relentlessly keep slapping the children and they irrepressibly keep disobeying. It's a horrible feeling of being caught in this ugly angry space for principle's sake. (191 words)

I'm going camping and packing things up for the trip. The girls have tossed in a bunch of their underwear without trying to neatly pack it. I stuff things in a duffle bag. Bonnie suggests we take something pretty to wear for Saturday night. I say I have some thing, but I don't really want to party then, I'll be too tired. Dovre, younger, maybe pre-teen, decides to go explore a ship on the river. I watch her go in and then get concerned. Is she safe? I go to the ship and pound on the door. There's a surly captain and rough-looking crew men. I ask if anyone saw Dovre come in. They shake their heads no. I demand to see the Captain. He comes to me, looking mean and noncommittal. I ask him if he has seen my daughter. He says no. I say, "She came in here." He says, "I'll ask the men if they've seen her." I suspect they are hiding her and intend to rape her later. I say to him firmly, "If you are a man, you'll ask your men that question with authority behind it. If you care about her safety, then they will." He smiles coldly. I don't trust him. I say, "If you don't genuinely try to find her, then I'll get the police." He says, "Id rather you got the police. The men wouldn't like it if I acted that way" (concerned for the girl). I say, "Fine, I'll get the police." He says, "I'll go with you." We walk toward the police station. We sit for a moment and I say something like, "You're just half a man." (279 words)

I am in a store and want to buy some soft angora pink yarn. I am knitting the knit-purl ribbing of a sweater. I watch me knit, careful to not drop a stitch. I almost do, several times. I am knitting quickly. I take a tray with costume jewelry and the boxes of yarn over to the counter. I move the loose pearls and gems over to the left and count the boxes of yarn. Some are pink, some are white. It is going to be expensive to make this sweater. Now I am sort of married to Derek. A couple of young women come in and possibly his mother. They don't know Derek and I just got married and they are talking about him. It is clear to me that the woman Paige has a relationship with him. He's had many and I listen in carefully to try and overhear the truth. I feel hurt and unloved and betrayed. Now I go into another room where Derek/Darryl is and his two brothers. He is cold to me and his brother is caring. I go over to talk to the brother. Derek is jealous and demands to know why I pay attention to his brother, not to him. I tell him I know about Paige. He comes over to me and kneels, hugging me, his blond head at my breast level. He is sad and sorry, pleading for me to stay and forgive him. I caress his hair. Now the young wives of the two brothers are getting dressed for the return home of their new husbands. One of them is Paige. The dark-haired one is changing her top and is quite excited to look special and pretty for her husband. I'm changing my clothes too. I step outside where Paige is and say, I know about you two. She says, "Oh?" I say, "Tell me what it was like." She says, "He's a hard one, complex." He used to like to watch me do it (make love with someone). (340 words)

I and some other Americans are on the cliff face trying to find a treasure or something valuable. The Russian crew is following us, watching, perhaps video taping us. We pretend the treasure isn't there and go on looking at another spot. Then we rush back to the original spot. Now a Russian team on the opposite canyon wall throws a basketball. This is a challenge. I manage to catch it and say to the Russians near us, on our side of the cliff, "See! ONE! One point." I am being victorious because the score is being kept in American language, not Russian. I now try to throw the ball. It is heavy and I don't get it airborne very much. It falls, I see a poof of smoke and then someone else on my side almost catches it. (139 words)

I am in a house, which I think belongs to Cousin Leroy, who is married, only he loves me. He has a younger sister or niece who is not being responsible. I follow her out to the sidewalk where she has a sort of wooden box like a cupboard or desk combination. I go through the mail and papers. Some other woman with me says, "Here, see? She owes volunteer hours at the Y." "What does that mean?" I ask. She says it means she hasn't paid her bills. This is the proof we need for cousin Leroy to confront her. Now I am writing down what he should say on yellow post-it notes. It says, "Because you have not been responsible, you will have to move out." I follow my cousin into the house. He is sitting on the couch. He grabs me affectionately and pulls me into his lap and we kiss and cuddle. I hear someone walking down some stairs and struggle to quickly get out of his embrace so we won't get caught. He is married, after all. He won't let me go. He listens and says it's his father and he's going outside, not through the living room where we are. The thought is there that maybe I'll be his second wife (meaning simultaneous with his first wife.) (223 words)

I am attending a math class, college math or something. I am attracted to the math teacher and I'm also angry at him. He is flippant and puts me way far away from the regular classroom students who are younger than me. Or else I choose to sit far down the hall, maybe a combination. I decide to leave and I gather up papers and decide to take with me photos of him even as I am telling him I don't like him. I pile them all up and know that as soon as I try to leave, the papers will all fall and make a mess. So in playful defiance of him, I go to his cupboard and take out three rubber bands. He mocks shock that I knew where they were and that I'd have the audacity to take them. We are flirting even though we are pretending to dislike each other. (154 words)

I've invited Derek over for a party and we're both excited because we're going to get to be kissy and huggy. Only, we don't seem to get alone. An old man, someone of Derek's friend's father, needs comforting. I do that. Derek's friends keep dropping by. Finally, I sit on the couch with him and cuddle. I kiss him twice on the cheek and he gasps like, "Oh, my God, it's starting already and I'm scared." I smile at him reassuringly and he takes the plunge and kisses me and we neck. I feel his gut twitch from his gut pain. Now there's another interruption and I get up to help the old man, and I look in a mirror and see foam stuff foaming up on my head under my hair. I am embarrassed. Maybe I shampooed with the wrong stuff. I lean over the sink and turn on the faucets and I take handful after handful after handful of the foam off my head. More seems to be foaming up, never ending. Now Derek and a woman like Neila are arguing. I go to the back bathroom and continue the washing process. It's taking forever. Derek comes back and leans on the door. It partially opens. I try to keep it closed because I don't want him seeing me all foamed up and with wet hair. He's upset, so I let him in. It's kind of comforting and intimate. He sits on the step to the door and watches me, concerned. He say, "I've got a book we should read. They pretty much recommend you talk it over with the woman pretty much before you fall in love," meaning the sex manual for sex with a para. He smiles up at me and tears come to his eyes. In frustration, he pounds himself on the stomach and legs. He says, "A friend called. He wants to come by and visit. I know you like Sundays and want some loving connected time." He's afraid I'll be mad at him. I smile at him and say, "Don't you understand? I already feel loved, just being near you." I see I'm pulling strands of hairs out with the foam. "Oh, my God," I say, Now I'm going bald too." Now the woman counselor friend of Derek's, called Jane, comes in and is very upset. She has hair things, barrettes and hair clips and rollers in her hand and accuses Derek of stealing them. He's denying it. I turn, wet hair in a towel, and put my hands on her shoulders to stop her from leaving the room. I say, "We can work this out. Let's talk. He didn't do this. I know he didn't." She's pissed at me for blocking her and doesn't want to talk. I have a vague sense of distrust; maybe Derek did take them. (477 words)

Jean-Luc Picard is captain of the space ship and a woman is an officer. Jean-Luc gives me a present, pictures of theaters, like The Shakespearean Theatre. I say, Thank you," but am a bit puzzled why he'd give them to me and a bit disappointed it wasn't something I liked more. I appreciated that it was in the Theatre area of interest, but it's a bit removed from writing and creativity. Now the ship lands on a planet where we rescue the inhabitants from an underground building they'd been locked up in. They are all women and they are clones of each other. There might be different main types or groups. They are docile and unemotional. Now a big bad guy in black, like a Roman Centurion costume, comes into the picture. Somehow we are in a confrontation and he has set it up to where every time we demand something from him, we will have to hurt one of the women, who are now referred to as goddess. We'd demand information and he'd refuse to give it and a docile semi-comatose goddess would walk up to be punished. But we decide rather that each time this happens, we do not hurt the goddess. We cut him. It only takes once. He sees some blood near his nose and whimpers and lays down like he's dying. (226 words)

I look at a building that is being built out of a rock face of a mountain. I say, "Hey, it's almost done, you can hardly see the rock face at all." It's a brick and glass building now. I walk toward it and a man comes out from the left to greet me. This building is like the University Admissions building and this man is an administrator type. I say, "That sure looks great." He asks if I'd like to go see the inside, even though it's not completely finished. I say sure. We go to the door, which is heavy and hard for me to open. The man is not helpful, and seems hesitant to even want me to go in now. I get the door open and go in. I walk up some stairs. Portions of the floor seem warped even though this is a brand new building. I go around a corner and see booths like Saturday market indoors. This is City Hall and all the departments have booths instead of offices. The first booth I see is the New World Theatre Booth. A man there, an actor, asks if I know where Derek is, because he'd really like to work with him again. I say, "I'll tell him. I'm sure he'd like to do that." I go to the next booth, a woman and her husband. I think they do costumes. (236 words)

Derek and I are going to have sex. It is a very complicated ritual. I have to lay a certain way. His wife is coordinating and assisting all this. She brings me a wheelchair with cushions in it and places it over Derek who is laying on his belly on top of me. I'm now supposed to get up and sit in the wheelchair. I don't want to. I think all this is unnecessary. If all these people would just go away (Ellie and Kyle are both there, each in their own pickup truck), things would happen naturally. I try to tell Ellie to leave and I'd find a ride home myself later. She gets out of the truck and refuses to leave. She is being protective of me. Derek gets confrontational with her, saying she's done this sort of thing before (been hostile or refused to do what he said, or something like that). Some woman is perched on the bed to our right in the upper corner; she is just sitting there. (174 words)

I am in a living room. Derek is there, as well as Charla and other relatives. Derek and I had done half of a script I'd written. We'd taped it, maybe radio or audio tape, I don't know. Charla was in it. Now at 2:00, we'll go in and tape the second half. I'm checking the script to see if Charla is still in it. Some woman relative says, "...But Dovre is so angry at Derek. If he has to go pick Charla up, she'll be mad at him." I say, "Then I'll go get her." I see Charla isn't in the script in the second half and notice there are only long monologues for Derek and me. I see Derek sitting in an easy chair and I hop happily into his lap. I realize that's a bit intimate, so I scoot up on the arm of the chair. I alternate being in his lap and getting up on the arm of the chair. I tell Charla she can stay here with the relatives for a while, as she's not in the script. I am relieved she takes it well and is happy to stay. I see two young men come in and I think one is just like Tony Curtis. Is he a cousin or an Uncle? I am trying to remember. It seems he used to be a relative many years ago. He says hello to me and I realize he is perhaps a son of the old one I remember. He doesn't remember me. I go to Aunt Naomi and ask her if that was Tony, not the Dressel one, but the one that I might have know many years ago. She is surprised and tells me a story of a young man she loved long ago. I say, "But have I met him?" She says, "No." I realize she thought I was being psychic and clicking in on her past love. She is very tall. Now I go into another room. Derek is there holding an oblong box with lots of buttons in it, a musical instrument of some kind. Uncle Joel is there. Derek also has some golf clubs. I teasingly take one and we tease back and forth about how I don't know how to play golf. I say, "Sure I do. You take this club and you..." I look at the ends. No hitting part. So I tickle Uncle Joel's nose with it and we laugh. Then I take the box and try to play a song. At first it is random notes and then I start to get the hang of it and play a nice rhythmic rumba kind of music and end on three bass notes. Everyone is laughing happily and applauding. It is very joyful and I feel good about having figured out how to do it and do it well. I then look at the buttons in the box and realize I've mushed them all up until they are a messy mass of what looks like rubber eraser bits. I say, "Oops, hope you can put it back together" (to Uncle Joel). I then realize it's almost 2:00. I get up to go change my clothes to go to the taping. Uncle Joel is seated on a stool and is sad. He tells me how he used to be good at things and now he can't do them any more. He just tried to read for five hours and on the short reading tests he did OK, but on the longer ones he couldn't remember what he'd read. I am very sympathetic and tell him how I've had to go on and learn new things and give myself grace and time to get good at the new thing. I sort of am aware I'm lecturing, even though I am genuinely sympathetic and loving. I look over at Derek to see if he noticed. Now I'm holding Uncle Joel's hand and I'm walking away to go change. I still have his hand in mine and turn to see that Derek had exchanged Joel's hand for his own and is walking behind me. We go into the bedroom and I see it is 2:00 now. "Oh," I say, "We're late...." I rush around getting the clothes. Derek is very mad at himself for being late again and slaps himself on the legs. I say, "...but first I really got to go pee." I rush for the bathroom. (746 words)

I have returned to work at the community college. I am advising the new students. A man comes up and asks about a lot of different things, like classes in legal aid and religious studies and so on. I ask if he intends to get a degree, either a 2-year or a 4-year one. He doesn't know. He just wants the classes. I get the catalogue and start trying to get the information. I am aware I've been gone for a long time and don't know the new information or the new format it is in. I find a section on Oceanography. Leafing backwards in the catalogue, I find Science. Then, I go forward in the catalogue and find Spiritual, or Religious Studies. I say, "Oh, of course, it would be in alphabetical order." The man is quite happy with me and keeps kissing me on the neck and cheek. I am annoyed with him and finally tell him firmly to stop that. He goes away. Now, I walk toward another section of school. I am outside and walking toward a wooden bridge. Now there is a dream sequence in the dream, where I give up and say to my female partner who I've been living with for some time (like Theresa and Christie of Rochelle's friends), that I give up. We can make love. It's OK now. I wake from that dream and wonder if I really did that and made love, or if it was only a dream. I try to notice how my body feels and decide that it was a dream and we didn't actually make love. I am relieved. I now walk toward the bridge and see Theresa/Christie on a truck. I smile tentatively, thinking she must think I'm really strange to just announce it's OK to make love after so long ignoring her. She smiles at me and says, "It's still a marriage even though I've been in the deep freeze for so long." She chats about things and asks me how it went at work yesterday. I say, "It was a long day, 8 to 10 hours, but I started getting the hang of it after awhile. The hardest part and the most tiring was working with the new students." The feeling is that we will get together later. I walk on across the bridge and see I'm in a fruit/produce section of a grocery store and pause to choose some snacks, fruits. I choose a banana, think about the apple or the pear, and eat the banana. Dickie stops by to get some too. Then, we'll head on over to where we'll be working. (442 words)

I am in a house. I decide I want everyone to help me clean up the mess and put their things away. I suggest we all pick up our own clothes and put them where they belong as a start. I specifically say to Jake, "Come on, you too." He groans and then they all start getting up and picking up their things and taking them to their rooms. I see a small girl holding two very heavy mirrors, with wood frames on them, maybe vanity mirrors. I say to Jake, "Why don't you give her a hand." He agrees and they go off together down the hall to a bedroom. I turn to supervise the rest and then see them returning down the hall. The little girl says that was a funny kiss and a really weird hug. I see Jake looks guilty and wants her to not talk about it and I realize with a sinking feeling that he sexually came on to her and I set that up by suggesting he help her. Somehow, I knew he'd do that, or I felt like I should have known. The damage is done. I feel bad. I go back to my room where I see Aunt Naomi has rearranged all my furniture and the bedroom is now like an alcove connected with the living room. My bed is now like a slide. I crawl up to the flat platform at the top and my water bottle goes sliding down. I am very uncomfortable as I'll slide off and down if I relax at all. I see large windows and a huge space which used to be crowded with furniture. I go into the living room part and see how some of my furniture is intermixed with the living room furniture. (301 words)

I am outdoors and cooking some stew on a burner of a stove. Or my mother is and I go stir it. Clothes are laying all over the stove and I am trying to get them off the burner so they don't catch on fire. Corinne is talking about something. She says, "Communication sure is hard." I agree and say, "But it's worth working it through." Then my mother says, "Then I suppose I have to tell you (Corinne) what Sue said." I can see they are going to have a hard time working through this without getting angry at each other. I try to help out. I then look up in the sky and see my father hang gliding. He does it every day, for his health, like exercise. I lose sight of him and then find him again and wave. Then I see the sky is filled with hang gliders, hundreds of them. Some of them are landing in the huge river in front of the stove. (169 words)

I'm taking a shower with Marshall Peters. Somehow this is working with the clients together. The shower stream of water is very thin and weak. Now I'm showering with Lucy, only instead of us doing it together, we take turns. I lather up with thick globs of shampoo soap. I am dressed, so when I lift up the blouse and rub my tummy, I get the dress wet. in spots. Then I eat something. Then Marshall comes in and talks about his client, who is a mess and does everything wrong and can't keep herself or her house clean. I realize with surprise he's talking about his wife.

There is a huge warehouse room and inside are screaming, terrorized people being mass murdered by machine gun fire. One of the bad guys, a woman, comes outside, because it is so horrible she can't bear it. She fires one bullet out of her machine gun in the general direction of others like her that are doing the killing. I sense that if she gets stronger, she will be able to defend and stop the mass killing. Some blood seeps out from under the door jamb. An umbrella with a spot of blood comes out and then a young teen woman in a yellow lace and satin knee-length prom dress, wrapped in a plastic bag, comes out. She will suffocate if she can't get out of the bag. Another young woman comes by and tries to untie the knot on the bag saying, "I'll undo the pie." The feeling is one of distance. I don't see the carnage, only small spots of blood and they are in a room. But I know this distant terror is real and could become close and be felt. (184 words)

Derek and I arrive at a house. The meeting will start soon, maybe a dream group meeting. Some of the people are arriving. I can't get my car parked. The gate is locked and I'd have to get out and unlock it. I'm across the other lane of the road where the road curves downhill and a car is coming, so I move the car to a rocky spot. It won't fit. I turn around and someone gets in and I get out. They will park the car. Now I go in. Derek arrives and comes in. We greet each other with a kiss and quickly we are passionately kissing and want to find a place to be alone to make love. We go to several different rooms and find a bedroom. We make love. I hold his head in my hands. It is a small head. I can't see his face well. He is feeling only down to his chest. As we wriggle around he groans in pleasure with pain. I ask, "Am I hurting you?" He says, "Yes, but it is OK," as it also is the orgasm. We desperately want each other. (195 words)

Derek and I are going to make love. A young girl, maybe Charla, is there. I'm sending her off to her room. I need to go pee. I ask him, "My place or yours?" He says, "Your place." I go find a toilet and pee a lot. Then this bathroom connects to my bedroom. I go in just as he is opening the door to the bedroom from the hall. He is standing, wearing a tank top and some leotard-like, flesh-colored outfit, like he's naked, only he's not. His legs don't move, and in fact I don't see legs. He's sort of stiff. We make love passionately. Now I go out and see Derek in a car. There are five cop cars in a line and his car is right behind them, a perfectly safe place to be. Another man is in the backseat of Derek's car and he opens the door and invites me in. I get in, happy to be alone with Derek. I curl up with the other man who says it's OK to press back against him if it's more comfortable. Derek gets out to rearrange himself and his assistant helps him back into the car. We are going to be together and that makes me happy. [BL] (211 words)

A small "grandma" mouse is in danger. A snake is coming toward her and will swallow her whole. I am concerned and squeamish. Then the snake thinks to itself, "I'll try a different approach. I'll go slow and hypnotize her and then pounce." He moves slowly toward her, head on. She watches. I want to call out, "Run. Run." Then the snake goes inside her mouth, instead of swallowing her. She has the opportunity to save herself by biting off the snake's head. I am squeamish because I don't want to watch or hear it, but she doesn't do it. Her mouth is a huge "O" shape as the snake puts his head inside. (114 words)

Storm Kennedy and I are looking at a pile of photos and magazine pictures I've collected. We go into another room. A man is there and I park my wheelchair next to him. He is going to explain some financial matter to me. He asks if I have any popcorn and I say, "Yes, I do." I go to the counter across the room where there are many, many small drawers, like in a kitchen. I look in each drawer and discover I'm out of the microwave popcorn packages. I see a few piles of spilled popcorn seeds, but it would be too much work to pop them the old-fashioned way. In another drawer are more magazine pictures and photos. I pick up a sort of radio earphone thing, but it's not what I thought it was. It was supposed to be a " _____ticket". (145 words)

The children, maybe five or seven of them, are being noisy and interrupting and I can't do my writing. I am angry and slam the door to keep them out of my writing room. They pound on the door and yell and I am furious. All I want is some peace and quiet so I can write. I push things off my desk and grab a typewriter and begin to furiously type anything that comes to mind. A pretty good story gets done. I determinedly finish it, ignoring as best I can the unruly children. Now I go out into the living room. It's a mess, with furniture moved all around, stuff all over. I go out to the mailbox on the porch and get the mail. As I am looking at what came, I see maybe five vans or station wagons pull up. The kids are back home. One vehicle is for Dovre, one for Ellie and her family and so on. I am surprised there are so many. I see that the clothes I had ordered for Howard's Christmas present have come in the mail. Now I call to the kids to come into the house NOW. I am angry and demand they come. They saunter in, being insolent and rude. I slap some on the face repeatedly. I yell at them. I make them all sit on the couch and I rail into them. I say, "Things are going to change around here." I know 50% of this is my fault and 50% is their fault. I hear me thinking (for them) that if there are five of them and 50% is their total fault, then only ___% is each individual's share of the fault. I sneer and say, "Let's get on with the important stuff." One goes to the fridge in the kitchen. I lunge after him screaming, "Get back here NOW." Two little ones wander off the couch and I say, "Out. Get out and never come back." They finally leave. I feel a little sad, but determined to gain control and not be taken so advantaged of. "Things are going to be different from now on," I say and begin to lay down the rules. They continue to snipe and not pay attention. (379 words)

I have written a book. I am looking at it and notice that I've tried to sketch a few illustrations. As I turn the pages, I notice that the illustrations get better and better with more detail. I think, "I'd like to show this to Derek, so he'd see I tried to do art work too." Then, I see the book is larger and the illustrations are in color and they are very detailed. I wonder if I had done these; probably not, since they are so good. I can't do this well. The first pictures were pencil sketches of hands, somewhat crooked fingers, like mine many years ago. I think, "That's interesting they are like mine," and then I think, "But, of course, they are. People create art like themselves." One picture is over two pages, a skeleton in the sand on a desert island. The next page is his skull. Then there are missiles with smaller missiles coming out of them, four pictures in a vertical row showing the smaller missile coming out. "Looks phallic," I think. I examine the picture closely, thinking, "Naw, there's no way I could have done this one. Maybe I did a collage, but it is obviously not a collage." Now I close the book and look over to Howard, who is in a narrow bed. Under the bed are piles of my clothes. I see a huge ant who picked up a crumb or a maggot and is lugging it over to the clothes to eat it. I am fascinated. I look at the bed and think, "If you put a box over it, a person could set it up so you'd have everything you'd need there. A great bed for an invalid." It looked a bit like a coffin. Now a little girl comes in. I'd heard her in the bathroom throwing up. She is crying. I say, "Not feeling good, huh?" I feel a bit guilty for not having gone to help her. Then she looks distraught and I see she's having diarrhea. I say, "Oh, it looks like you've got the stomach flu. Go on into the bathroom. It's all right." She has left little piles of shit like chili con carne on the floor. I follow her in to help clean her up, only now I see the toilet is overflowing. Water is all over. She's crying. I yell down the hall to my father, "Hey the toilet is overflowing. Come help get the water cleaned up." He comes out to help. The girl is mopping up water with towels. It's a mess. (435 words)

Sparky wants to plug in a string of Christmas lights that have a short circuit in them, or rather the switch in the wall does. The lights go on and off. I suggest she try another switch or plug in. Kenneth comes in dressed in a graduation gown, a witch's hat and funky platform-heeled shoes. Sparky is a bit taken aback. I say, "He's like that," somewhat proudly. Kenneth grabs the string of lights and says, "Let's try plugging them in over here." I am pleased he has the same thoughts as I do and acts upon them. Now he's hungry and wants to eat. He grabs a hamburger from a buffet bar in the center of the room and another one for Sparky. She says she doesn't want it. So he puts it back and places two sandwiches there. A fat, bald baby is sitting there and she takes a huge bite out of the sandwich. I go to her to stop her from eating Kenneth's food. Her mouth is overflowing with mayo. She's sliding off the high chair. I have a bag in my left hand and am trying to keep her from falling off the chair and keep feeding her too. I wonder why I didn't think to put down the bag so I could use both hands. Then a man is laying on the floor. His face is pudgy and bald like the baby's. He says he's joined the Marines. I say, teasing, "They only want a few good men," and he and I say together, "but if you're not a good man, they'll make your life hell." We laugh. [BL] (274 words)

I am auditioning for a play. I am the only woman trying out for the "Alice" role. Four men are there to try out. One is skinny, one is short, one is very tall, like 7 feet, 5 inches. When he comes out on stage (I am in center stage as these men come out and they then go sit on a bench behind me), the director teases him about his height. I gently admonish the director not to make fun of people who are different. I figure this audition will be pretty easy, since I'm the only woman trying out. I'm given a fat script held together by paper clips. Now other women come out and it's not so cinchy any more. I'm told to read the part of Ana. I look for where she comes in. Three other women are on stage doing parts and I am now concerned and struggling to find the place they are at in the script so I know when to enter. The more I try to find the place, the more messed up the pages get. Now the script is in two or three major chunks. I hear them say, "Ana." I know they are waiting for me to enter. I come out and say to the director, "I can't find the right page. I think it's missing in the script." I go to the front of the stage. It is very high up from the auditorium floor. The stage is slippery and I'm in socks. I can barely keep myself from sliding right off the edge and falling. The director is very distant, way down there, and he's annoyed. He's also concerned that if my script is messed up, maybe others are too. I feel guilty because I know it's my fault I can't find the page, not that it is missing, but I don't say anything. I have to grasp the curtains (a flannel or felt material -- one yellow, the other another color, perhaps blue or green) in order to stop myself from falling off the stage. The director gives me an 800 number I can call to get another script and dismisses me. I go back to try again to find the missing page, because if I go call the number, it will take too long and I'll lose out. The director has lost interest in me. (399 words)

I live in a house. Katrina and Derek are there to visit. I give them a tour. I live in the older part, which is equivalent to a 2-bedroom small house. The back bedroom was a remodeled add-on. Derek says, "There's one bedroom that isn't being used." I say, "Not only that, but there is more to this house. I like it better. It's bigger and the rooms are more interesting." I go down the hall and pass through two kitchens, each one fully equipped. The one in the hall has two refrigerators. I open the French-doors with glass squares to the spacious living room. There are big windows on the far wall, very nice. We look in. It is fairly empty. I wonder why I don't live here, and not in the small older square room I currently live in. I go on down the hall and show a bedroom, and at the end of the hall is a double connecting door. I try it to make sure and the inner door is locked, meaning the other side of this house is occupied with other people. I remember that last year I lived for a while in this side and had a hospital bed in the bedroom. I can't remember why I moved back to the older part. Now I want to go into the spacious living room and show Derek. We go in. I notice a hilly knoll of grass that needs to be tended to on the floor. I see two fireplaces and a kerosene heater, and a small electric heater. I see bookshelves on the wall, only it is all covered with knickknacks and clocks. Derek says, "You've got some really weird stuff in here." I say, "It's not mine." I look around. Lots of the clocks have seashells on them for decoration. One clock has two small secondhand circles. The hands are going around very fast. Derek asks me if I ever go to the coast to write. I say yes, I'd been to N City. He asks if I liked it. I say yes. I keep looking around and see a lawyer's glassed bookcase with weird knickknacks and wine bottles in it. I want the case, but not what's in it. Now we go to the bedroom and look around. A woman is there. Paulina at about 5 or 6 years is there. Derek and I had left our wheelchairs in the hall. He walked with a limp and a cane. I got back into my chair so he wouldn't feel bad. Now see Derek is seated in the wicker chair at a small wicker dining table. I choose to remain in my wheelchair and bump the table several times. I know it would be more comfortable if I transferred also, but I stubbornly don't. Paulina and I are talking about last year. We're playing a card game. (I wake up for a few moments and go right back into the dream. I am aware that I've dreamt this house before.) Now Derek and I are in another room and Paulina mentions a bunny. "Oh," says Derek, "I want to see the bunnies." I sit where I am and Derek goes into another part of the store and returns with a towel. He puts it in my lap. I know by this that he's decided he wants a bunny. He goes back to pick out one. I say, after he's out of the room, "I want to help choose. Paulina had a bunny last year. I want one of the round cute fuzzy ones." He goes upstairs and comes back with a flat kind of bunny. Now I have a lap full of six baby bunnies and a mother bunny, maybe the one from last year comes in and nests with them, like a mama bird. Another white one comes in. I pet it and it meows. I am surprised it is a cat and still wants to nurture the baby bunnies. (668 words)

A deaf female teacher/star is being sued by her husband over the lyrics of her song. The school board makes a ruling. She and the husband drive to the school to get the decision. A hired man (agent or something) is driving the car. There is a circle cul-de-sac and on the curb is the board, who are playing a tape of the song. This somehow is an embarrassment to the woman singer and she's pissed. So as they drive around the circle, she says to the driver, "Do it," meaning speed up the car, drive it up over the curb and over the lawn and through a sculpture; destructive. The driver pleads with her not to order him to do this. He says, "Please. I'm asking. I'm begging you. I'm demanding. I'm refusing." She stiffly and angrily orders him to do it. Against his own wishes, he then starts to obey her. Some woman (perhaps me) in the back seat reaches over and grabs the wheel and they fight as the woman tries to force them to not hit the sculpture. They crash and someone, the driver or the woman, is now walking alongside the singer, screaming at her angrily! "Damn it! You could be the most kind, helpful, loving person in the world with all the gifts you have and you choose to be destructive and mean. Why? Why do you do this?" She won't listen. She's too haughty and angry. (243 words)

I am in bed reading an article about the bus driver's getting a raise. A woman is interviewed. She'd gotten her raise just an hour ago. There's like a puzzle in the paper to fill out, the name of the driver, married or not, etc. I am trying to guess her name and write "Christina." Another name was a man's name and also ended in an "a." All of them did. In the interview, which I see happening, the woman driver says "I'm a family person. This raise gives me insurance for my husband and so on. Some people think it's frivolous to..." Then suddenly I'm aware there is a man in my bedroom. I am startled. He talks softly, but I am worried. There had been snipings lately and he'd somehow entered even though I'd locked the door. I remain calm. He chats about the bus driver's raise. I get up and try to encourage him to leave, pretending to be interested in the conversation. He goes toward the door, but then sits at the dinette table by the window by the door. He's gotten a cup of coffee. "It's too hot," he says. I realize he made it himself and the coffee machine is still on. I find that ominous. I humor him. He's scaringly calm and friendly. Finally he gets up and goes out, still chatting. As he goes toward the apartment stairwell, I shut the door, then reopen it to hook the lock on the screen door. He laughs and says, "Now why would you lock the door like that now? It wasn't locked before. I nervously say, "Oh, you can't be too careful." I notice the hook and eye are not properly attached and it will be of no help. I push the lock button on the door knob and shut the door. I think to myself, "He looks just like Robert Dinero. I rush to the phone to call the police. I am afraid. (330 words)

I am in bed asleep. Nate comes in. He wants to make love, so he starts his charming patter. He kisses me and I say, "Ummmm." He says, "What does a woman mean when she says "ummmm," and I lie and say, "It means, 'Oh, how interesting,'" but what it really means is "God that feels good. I want it." I ask him to leave. I get up. He follows me and holds me close. He puts his penis in as we are standing. I say, "No, not here, someone could walk by and see." We are in front of the open screen door (same place as first dream). So we're walking around clinging and he's kissing me. We go into another bedroom and start to lay down on the floor. I'm sitting on him. Then a young crazy man comes in and stands near us. He's talking to himself and has papers and shirts and they fall on the floor. Nate and I ask him to leave. He mumbles incoherently as he tries to gather up his stuff. Nate and I sit there, still coupled sexually, waiting. I help the young man hang up a shirt (white office work shirt) on a wire hanger. The hook is crooked. He hangs it up in his mouth, stretching his mouth out very wide. We uncouple and stand up, trying to herd the young man out. He asks if he can keep something. We get him to the porch. Now he and Nate have words and start to fist fight. I say, "Don't please." A woman comes up, a homeless woman looking for the ame place the young man was looking for. It is obviously the wrong address. There's a Styrofoam cooler with something rotten in it, and the man wants to know if he can have some. I say "Yes." He takes some. Now I see there is some strange metal ramp enclosed thing on the porch screwed into the railing. I see an elaborate (articulated sections) iron lung gadget next to it. The young man starts tinkering with the iron lung thing. I say, "It will get broken." Nate says, "Whose is it?" I say, "The government wanted to keep it here for awhile. I'm responsible." Nate says, "Did you agree to watch over it?" I said, "No." Then, he says, "You aren't responsible." I notice I am trying to unscrew the other thing and stop that. I would like these things gone, but somehow they'd been foisted on to me. So as Nate and I are watching, the man dismantles parts of the iron lung thing. I'm wishing that they'd go away so I could finish making love to Nate. Nate says, "Well, hope they hurry because I'm getting married tomorrow." I say, "What did you say?" He realizes he's blown it. He makes something else up and I say, "No, you said getting married tomorrow." I swing open the screen door. He looks at me like a naughty boy and steps out. "Sure you won't change your mind," he wheedles. I say sadly, "No." I really would like to make love to him but, oh, well. He blew it. (531 words)

I'm pumping iron and decide to up the weights to 50 pounds. I hold in each hand a huge, thick weight. It is almost too much. It is difficult to do curl-ups and then I notice I am making it to 20 or so reps, which is impressive. I am slim and fit-looking in my spandex leotard outfit. I try to go down a flight of stairs with the weights in my hand and nearly fall down the stairs as my balance is not used to the added weight. (89 words)

I've moved into a place. I notice that we only brought the furniture this time and the move is much easier because I left behind all those boxes of papers and my writings. Dwight and I are talking about what we're going to be. I say, "I wanted to be an artist and I wanted to be a writer but it's not going to happen. I used to be a counselor and a teacher but I can't do that anymore because of my arthritis," (and I feel a bit guilty about that because I know that's not completely true). I feel like I'm drifting. I don't know what I want to do. Dwight is hungry and opens up a cupboard where I'd cooked left-over lunch, taco pizza. It looks pretty gross, but he eats it anyway. Now, I'm trying to run a writer's group, with Aunt Elaine and some young cousins, maybe Uncle Lionel. I can't get them to get settled down. They wander around and giggle and talk and interrupt and leave and come back. Finally in exasperation I say, "This is like teaching kindergarten kids!" They are sympathetic and try to come to order. Suddenly, I see a huge plastic air-filled duck drop down, like in Mace's parade balloon. It falls into the hedge near the windowed wall. I am amazed and go over, thinking suddenly, "Maybe there's someone in it. Maybe it's an alien from outer space." I get closer and see that there is something in it, eight babies. I say, "Someone call 911 and get the police...no, the medical people first, to take a look at those babies!" Someone goes to call. We wait and wait. It's taking them far too long and we get suspicious they've sent for the military. I say, "There's no way I'll let the military guys come in here first without making sure the babies are all right." A man now comes in a navy uniform, only it's a captain of the work crew that's been building the submarine complex out in the bay or ocean right outside the windows. Someone had called him about the duck, Murphy Salvage, or something. I explain we're first waiting for the hospital people. I put in another call. They are cold, distant and confused. Now I'm alarmed they are up to something. The Captain pulls me aside to talk. I say to him, "Too bad your sub isn't ready yet," because I know he's just recently sent up a work crew to rest or something and it was empty. He says, "Well, it is working, technically. A few men are down there. It's almost ready for its shake-down cruise." I look at him, wondering if we could hide down there. He then smiles at me and begins to say something like, "I've always liked you but somebody had to do or say something to let the other know they're interested." I look at him surprised. He then leaps off the table he's sitting on and gently but insistently pushes me up against the windowed wall, where outside the waters are churning turbulently. He kisses me. I am aware that it's an OK kiss but not really exciting and he's OK looking but not all that handsome. I think, "He has tufts of hair in his ears and a bit of a paunchy belly." After the kiss, I say to him, "Well, I never even thought of this as a possibility before." I pause as he waits, thinking over my feelings, and then I say, "I'm willing to 'work at' the possibility and see what happens." (I use an academic word that starts with "A" for "work at.") He is very happy. He has a chance. We are all going to hide the duck on his sub and he will court me in those rough waters. (642 words)

I am marrying a man. We are sweet on each other. His mom finds out and is very jealous and pushes me away. She doesn't want me near her boy. I watch, as the story unfolds that for years she's been abusing him in horrible, torturing ways, handcuffing him to the wrong place on a trailer and then driving, him being drug on the dirt road, the wheels just barely missing running over him. He cries and begs for her to stop, but she just laughs crazy like Sybil's mom. Finally, the pain of being drug is so bad he tries to get himself situated so that when the handcuffs release, he's in the path of the wheels and he'd be run over, killed, and put out of his misery. I feel painful empathy for him. Now she's in a house telling him to get ready for bed, she's got his medicine ready for him. She goes into the bathroom and pees and has a bowel movement into the water and then she's going to put it in his medicine. I am repulsed by what I see. She sees me watching and screams at me to get out. "Get out." Now there's a dad too, a retired military man who works at a boy's school. (He describes how careful you have to be and not be in the bathroom with a boy alone.) He's usually gone, but occasionally comes home and has violent sex with her and with a woman friend of mine. The dad and mom love/hate each other very much. He has some white cream in a tube he puts in her vagina or on his penis. He wants her to eat some. She refuses. I take a small bit into my mouth, like being nice and helping him to feel better and not rejected. My woman friend also takes a taste on her tongue. Then he says, quite chattily, that he's had syphilis for 20 years. He starts to describe the symptoms. I am sick and ask permission, "If you don't mind, I'd like to rinse out my mouth." I try to rinse and spit to get it all out. It's a bit foamy now like shaving cream. I hope I got it all out before I swallowed any so I don't get diseased. Now some fat secretary woman is describing how he'd lock her in the bathroom, her in her black slip, and take a whip. (He'd be in full military uniform. I'm amazed because I thought he was just a psycho security guard or something, but it's a real military uniform.) "He cracks a mean whip," says the woman, "and it really hurts." I feel the pain on my butt in sympathy of her real pain. I flinch. This is a sick and crazy man. Then he insists I make love to him and twists my nipples to stimulate me. I feel sexual excitement and do it. (492 words)

Derek is painting pictures of mountains. I am trying to paint one too. I have my palette and see a sort of yellowish color up in the right hand corner, an odd color for the sky. Derek starts to dabble in my colors and I ask him not to. I then awkwardly attempt to paint. I draw a steep-peaked mountain and remember what my father said about how mountains aren't really that steep. I redraw it in softer curves. I discover how leaving some portions of the canvas blank and using that whiteness as a part of the picture enhances the picture. I create many different mountain ranges with some kind of building structure in the left corner foreground. It's pretty good. [BL] (122 words)

I go to a dating service and see the video of a man named Jim. I am very attracted to him and know that he's the one I want. I make a video of me. I say, "This is what I look like. You can see I'm in a chair, and older and plump." Then I squirrel around in my wheelchair, showing him my energy and personality. I hope he'll accept me. He does, and we set up a first date. I am excited and a little scared. I know this is so right, I am looking forward to it. He comes to my hotel/apartment. I meet him in the lobby wearing a yellow satin prom dress kind of thing. It is awkward and OK. (125 words)

I am driving a car and am following a truck. I see that it is a flatbed truck and a couple of horses are on it. And as I watch, the horses have loosened themselves from their stalls and are slowly drifting or sliding over to the back edge. They are going to fall off and hit the road and I'll be killed and so will they. I slam on my brakes to get some distance between the upcoming accident and me. As a result, an eight-car collision occurs. Now we are stopped, and on the side of the road. I am dazed. I look into the rear view mirror and see the cars all smooshed up, fender to fender. Everyone seems unhurt but angry. One of them marches up to my driver's side door, which is open, and starts to lecture me on being more careful. I am furious and tell him off, explaining that I probably saved our lives by doing it this way. Now another man comes up and asks me if I'm all right. He's very friendly and seems gentle and on my side. I suddenly get suspicious as he gets into the passenger side, that he is a doctor. He agrees. He is a doctor. That pisses me off because I hate it when some one is kind and caring because it's their profession or it is in general for everybody. I want that to be for me. He is suggesting we drive to the hospital. I ask if they (the police) are done with us, and then I am driving away, assuming that they are. I am flirting gently with the doctor. We drive to his house. He is married and has kids and yet it is clear he likes me very much. He says, "Can you manage to go over there?" "Where?" I ask. "To the barn." I go there, wondering what this is all about, and trusting it. He has a one-horse sleigh and we're going to take a ride. It is sweet and romantic. He helps me in and wraps a warm black fur blanket around me tightly, like you'd tuck in a blanket around a baby. I smile and then get worried he's pinning me down, my arms, and I'll be taken advantage of. But I calm down and trust him. He shows me there really is a horse in the barn, meaning we'll really go for a ride. I ask how we can do that with no snow on the ground, and he says it has special wheels on the skids. Now his teen boys come in and are very curious about who I am and why I'm here. They seem to understand that their father loves me and it's OK with them because they want their father to be happy. It is gentle and soft. (477 words)

I am watching a young man who was a star athlete in high school. He's graduated now and doesn't know what to do. He's a nobody now. So he returns to high school to hang out and becomes a delinquent. He plays mean tricks on people and is insolent. A woman teacher (dark hair) is walking down the sidewalk. It's lunch break. The boy says to his cohort, "Hey, I'll pay you 75 cents to moon her with me." The other boy says, "Nah." The boy takes a pair of scissors and snips off a bit of his hair. He says, "OK, then a buck." "Nah," says the other boy as he snips off another bit of hair. The other boy says, "For 1.50, I'll do it." The boy is upset it is so much. He must be losing his control, but he agrees. So as the teacher walks past them, they pull down their pants. Her first initial automatic response is to gasp and get angry and righteous, but she realizes this is exactly what they want and so she just says, "Huh," like she's bored and walks on. She's quite please she figured out how to let the air out of their balloons! She is very upset and thinking hard, because she's on probation. She has stood up to a student (male) and people are upset with her. It isn't fair. As she walks, she sees an orange and white cat who she wants to pet. She stoops down to pet it and it loves being petted, laying down on it's side and purring as the teacher strokes its soft and sometimes matted fur. Suddenly she looks at her watch. It's 1 o'clock; she's late. She turns back and walks toward the school. She notices the houses on the left. One is a single room, empty, pretty, but too small. It has a step, but on the side is a ramp. "Good," thinks the teacher. The houses are older and nice. She now either recalls or receives a phone call from the mother of the male student who she stood up to. The mother is nasty and mean. She is saying that the teacher just isn't understanding enough. She misunderstood the student's intentions. Did he speak to you in a mean way? She sneers like that is going to prove the teacher wrong. The teacher tells her it's the mother's fault and this annoys the mother very much. She makes a sarcastic remark, thinking she has proven her point that she is right and the teacher is wrong and hangs up. She leaves her room as her husband is entering it. The husband says, "How are you?" She grumps, "Yep," well satisfied with herself. The husband shrugs and ignores her. Now the teacher is nearly to the school and decides to go in the side door and hopefully avoid the main office. She hopes that there was a fire drill so her lateness will not be noticed. She sees that along the wall of the high school are displays of different breakfast cereals: Wheaties, Cheerios, Men's____ (like study group) and on the left side of the sidewalk is a stack of cereals called "Misjudgments. 50 ways to count."

I am vacationing on Hawaii. I look forward to the beauty. but things keep going wrong: the wrong bus, we get stalled, we can't find the place. I discover it's just a tourist trap. Finally I leave and then decide to return, thinking I can find some small corner near the beach where I can enjoy the ocean and surf and beach. I know I made the wrong decision, but I do it anyway. I find a rundown neighborhood. The tourist fancy buildings are off on the horizon, but I can't find the ocean. (94 words)

I am being encouraged to go to a river and cross the bridge so I can get a good look at the river. I come to the river's edge and look down. It is full of brown water and strong currents. I don't want to cross the bridge and look at the river. I see cars driving in the river and wonder how they can breathe in there, because the car looks like it is under the water. I look more closely and see the water is only up to their necks. Close enough, I think. I decide to go away from the river. I am going against traffic. It is hard and slow. I round a corner and see a glimpse of the ocean where the river runs into it. The waves are huge and white and foamy as they crash against the rocks. I want to go down on the beach. A man also wants to go there and we sort of go together. Now we are on the beach. We pass a room where it's a sort of a glassed-in museum and a 95-year-old grandma is inside telling the visitors whatever they want to know about the things in there. I am curious and sign up for my turn to go in. Now I have my girls and a young college age girl as part of my party to go in and see the woman. The man and I are friends now. As we wait, the woman, now an older spiritual guru type woman, comes in flustered and says somewhat shortly at her male partner/business manager/lover, "You're not sending in the right kind. I want only the ones that are willing to work." I feel a bit concerned. I sort of want to work and yet I am not completely trusting that she isn't just some fake guru and will lead me astray, and I'll be sincerely working only down the wrong path. Now she's ready for us and he calls us to come quickly for our time with her. I call out to the girls who are scattered by now. The man and I go sit down on the floor right in front of the couch barrier in front of her. I accidentally knock off a few unset gems (jewels) that were scattered across the top of the couch-like barrier as I try to get down on the floor. Now the man and I cuddle, my back into his front as I lean back into his comforting presence. She won't work with us until we are relaxed, deeply asleep and open. I am almost there, I am warmly asleep and yet I am fighting it. I don't know how to get to that feeling place I have to get to for her to do her work. The harder I try, the more awake I become. Now the session is over and we stumble back out to the beach, sleepy and yet we need to drive back home. The man and I will share driving one car and the girls will share driving another. We'll take turns when the other gets sleepy. The college student girl is concerned. She needs more information, but the woman is gone now. I say, "Well, we have her business card. Here's her phone number, but I think it will probably not work because she probably lives way out in the coast range and will be inaccessible to us." I try to encourage the girl to let go of needing the answer and come home to rest. (595 words)

Robert Redford has been out drinking. He comes in late at night and I am already in the hide-a-bed. I am not asleep, but pretend to be. He stumbles in and decides to lay down by me on the bed. He is married, but we are attracted to each other. He lays down across my belly, mumbling to himself. I feel him begin to have an erection. He is sexually excited about being close to me. He is upset with himself for feeling this. "Damn," he mumbles. "Usually, when this happens, I dance. But maybe she doesn't want me to dance. I don't have any idea. I don't have any idea. I don't have any idea." He is whispering to himself and then he curls up around me and gently, softly kisses my shoulder, chest area. Then he begins to gently kiss the chin bone and jaw, moving up to the lips, and I am consumed with a raging, pleasurable sexual desire. I wake up startled, like I'd somehow bailed out too soon, out of automatic response. (177 words)

[I go back to sleep quickly and fall into the same dream,] only now, my mother is there asking me how come I didn't make love to him. He's so adorable, sweet and handsome, irresistible. I say somewhat stuffily, "That it was against my principles because he is a married man." (39 words)

I am in a car with a mentally retarded man. He is driving. I feel wild and spontaneous and I dare him to drive across the Golden Gate bridge. He does and the more dangerous he gets in his nonawareness, the more I like it. I encourage it. We go across lanes, spin around doing 360's and so on. Later, I order him around telling him to go get the car. He finds it where he crashed it in a field, and sees a round, gashed-out dent in the rear fender area. He opens the door and sees a young preteen girl who is cute, with long bushy hair. She is the woman's younger self. She's not so wild, simply alert and open and fun-loving, a healthier version. I then see the puppy of the dog that goes with the woman, also innocent, frisky and cute. Now the teen woman decides to go steady with the mentally retarded man. The ritual is to get a special going steady kit which is used to clasp the 2-inch wide band of yellow plastic webbing around the wrist. After it is fastened, her mom comes out and is very concerned, not asking directly, for fear of riling up the teen woman, but still worried she's making a mistake. (215 words)

I am in a house like the M City house. I've decided to do a Shakespeare play and Ellie is going to direct it. We are going over the script. I say that already many excellent actors are letting me know they're interested in being in it. It's going to be a very good play (I had typed I'm going to be a very good play by accident). I see myself seated to Ellie's right watching a rehearsal and getting a great idea for a particular bit of business that will be humorous, a special B touch that leaves my signature on the play. I go over to Ellie giggling, and say, "I've had a dynamite idea." I sense the actors on stage are very curious to see if I, the Mom, will simply override Ellie and make her do my idea, or if indeed Ellie is the REAL director. I think, "I hope I can let go if she doesn't agree." I can't wait to do the play. It will be such fun. Some woman notices (back at the M City house) some of the students' papers from class have drawings on them. I chuckle and say, "Yes, here I was all excited about reading the script and I asked them to hand in their papers, because I wanted to get out of there in a hurry, and one then says, "Oh, I have to make a cover," and proceeds to draw a cover with crayons. I sigh, and then laugh, and then say, "I really want to honor that style." Then a young woman comes up and talks about how she doesn't understand Shakespeare, or she doesn't know how to write it, and I suggest she draw it. (290 words)

I am living in the old M City House. The recreation room has been remodeled to my bedroom. I am moving things in and organizing the drawers. I look out the open door and see a giant man with no head walking with ponderous steps backwards. I am a bit afraid of him and remind myself to not get in his way. A man now comes to the door and I see that behind him is a huge buffalo. I try to shut and lock the door against him but he forces his way in anyway. I am also a bit afraid of him. He asks if I have any spark plugs. I say, "No I don't, but I'll ask my father. He's outside. You ask him." He goes out. Now, I see my bookcase outside the window with tall large books in it. Dwight then comes in and says he has a room off of my room. I see a door and go look in. My bookcase is in his room. His room is very small. He says it's OK to keep the bookcase in the little corner of his room. The giant man walks by again, only this time he has his head and is attempting to walk forward. Now, a man and a woman are talking. This is supposed to be a meeting I am involved in with another person, but they take over and I'm so tired, I let them. Finally I say, "Look, let's stop this meeting because you two aren't including us and I'm too tired now to change it." I say, "Let's set a time to meet next." The man says, "No, we can do that later." I say "No, it's easier for me to do it now because we're all here together; otherwise, I'd have to call and recall everybody." Now we have to find a calendar. No matter where we look, we can't find one. I open drawers and take out old wallets from long ago, noticing I'd left in small change. I am messing up the organization I'd so recently spent time fixing. There are lots of wallets and no calendar. I am very tired and sleepy and give up. (370 words)

I am on an island and the enemy (Japan) is looking it over to see if anyone is there. I am concerned and tell Ernie and the boys to stay in the shadows and avoid the light. That way, they'll not know we're here and maybe the war won't start. We get in the light anyway, and now we're informed the war will start at noon on Monday. I am trying to get to a safe place. Others are as well. An Asian woman is rushing up the mountainside. Now I'm in a group of people. In fact, I'm at the head of a marching group and I realize I'm in the army. A nasty DI sergeant is harassing me. "Keep up! Do it right!" I'm falling a bit behind. I want to be in the lead, but I don't want all this army stuff. "Turn right," he screams. We pause. A presidential flag ceremony is going on. "Should we go over and honor that?" "No," he yells. "It's a decoy. We're needed at the front." Now an announcer man with a microphone is going to the edge of the front. He's saying he'll probably be the first one shot in the war. Musicians are racing toward the front for the beginning of the war ceremony. Now there are crowds. The disabled group can't be found. I see the one on the other side getting organized. "Oh, oh. Where's Ellie and Charla?" I go looking. The DI finds me and says horrible things. I'm pissed and pull back my fist. I'm about to hit him in the face. He's grinning, "Yeah. Make my day. Hit me, you putz. Were you just going to hit me? That's assault of an officer...etc." I back down because he can make serious trouble for me. I see Mirabelle. She returned early from New Zealand because of the war. We hug. She cries. She's afraid; so am I. I'm frantic to find Ellie and Charla. Then I find them, laying down and waiting. I go to them. I see my black, furry pouch. Thank God. It had been stolen and here it was. I grab up my things and then realize the good credit cards and the driver's license, the money and car keys are gone. We're on the brink of war and I have NO ID, no identity. I scramble around and find Bonnie at a counter. I'm asking how I get my ID copied. I can't be without my ID at this crucial moment. She tells me some things to do. (428 words)

I am in a wheelchair and now have a small Volkswagen bug. I have had the front driver's seat removed and am trying to position my power wheelchair there. Now I want to remodel the chair. Why can't it be compact? New technology in batteries can make that part small and lightweight. It can be like a regular chair with small wheels and a tiny foot pedal thing. I go to a place and try to get them to build it for me. There are problems, but slowly the chair is built. (92 words)

I am in a house in the mountains. I am a comedy writer and I'm helping a man friend of mine be a comedy writer. We are free associating and brainstorming. Now, someone looks out the window and sees a stick of lightning and I wonder if the storm is coming close. It is. I see a thick funnel cloud develop on the ground. The top poofs out powerfully and it's a twister. The man is intrigued. He wants to know more. "OK," says another man, "but look out." The storm maker, a pixie-like man, comes out of the storm. It had traveled over to our hay mow. He offers the comedy writing man, now the father, a ride. He takes it. This is magic time. Off they go on the thunderous, rolling cloud, a muddy brown color. Now I am alone in the house, with a couple of grown sisters and a brother. They are off doing something. I see outside the storm has brought birds and animals made out of ice. An ice turkey buzzard comes into the house. He's mean and tries to peck things. I light a match and try to melt him. It's a very puny effort, but it does force him outside. I see a sweet ice puppy and try to melt it. It likes it. I feel bad about doing it. I go in and then see the tiny baby kitten. One has gone outside. I don't want to go out, but I do to rescue the kitten. It is fat and cute. I get it and run back in the house. The sisters and brother are back and I yell, "Quick, shut the door!" I yell that over and over as they are slow and unconcerned. My father is on the phone asking how we are and I'm telling him what's happening. Then we're all back in the house. One sister is an architect, another is some other important professional, and the brother is too. They are working on the problem. The architect asks for a computer file on LaCisine or something, a famous architect. This research might give her enough historical background to solve this problem. (365 words)

I am in a room, perhaps "my" room. It is my birthday. Two people sit on the couch. A Reynold-like man is seated on the floor across from me. I am in an easy chair. A woman is at my right. Derek/man is seated in the easy chair with me at my left. I can't really see him. I just sense his closeness. I am shy and afraid to look at him because I love him and he doesn't love me. Reynold puts on one of my hats with silk red flowers on it. He's laughing and looking silly. I smile, the hat starts to break up and a string of those red flowers goes from the hat toward me. It seems symbolic. There is an amazing abundance of those flowers. I am surprised. I only remembered two of them. Derek/man says to me -- I see him how seated a short ways from me on my left -- he says, "Just now, when I said this, what did you feel?" I look at him and smile gently and answer truthfully from the heart what I felt. Then I distract myself and pick up a small computer toy game. I idly start to fiddle with it, actually thinking of playing it while I sit here at my birthday party. Then Derek starts softly singing a sweet love song in an Elvis Presley type voice. It is something about I love you, but you don't know it. I feel such love for you, etc. I sigh and am touched and keep my face shyly averted from him because it is too heartbreaking to hear him say those words, knowing they aren't for me. A mentally retarded woman is standing to my right and she is saying something and I turn toward her slightly and listen, not wanting her to interrupt and letting her interrupt. She says she's leaving. I say goodbye. I notice a thick layer of dust on the computer games on the table to my right. He slowly moves around until he is more facing me and so close. I look up and he is in a kissing position. His eyes are filled with love and his voice soft and sexy. He kisses me tenderly and lovingly. I melt into it shyly. I am so happy. He does mean those words for me. Then he whispers, "But look at the dates! The 9th, the 22nd and now the 26th!!" (cousin Lenny's birthday, his birthday and our day of falling in love together). He says, "I've known you for a while, but I just fell in love with you two minutes ago." I reach over and kiss him again, being careful to make it a short kiss so he won't think I'm trying to be demanding or sexual. He asks me how I feel right this minute. I say, huskily, "Good. A minute ago, I felt bad and sad. And in a few minutes I will again. But right this moment, I feel good." I am flooded with a rising tide of loving feelings. I am suffused with love and sweetness and tenderness. (523 words)

I am on a committee. A radical malcontent is on the committee and some conservative women. I am helping facilitate, trying to hear and working with and honor both sides. I am getting annoyed at the radical. He's kind of into his anger and not really ready to work through stuff. I am in love with this man. I go visit his place. I'm talking to him about the committee. I am laying on his bed, on top of the blue and white coverlet. Some young woman is there, maybe his daughter. It is innocent and loving. He and I are interested in relationship but are shy and concerned. We are flirting and courting and getting serious. Now it's time for another meeting. the big meeting. I go there; the man is coming a bit later. I get some info out of a drawer, some pictures of athletes as possible evidence. I get to the room; I'm a bit late. They say, "Oh, here, in here." I go in and the table is round and most everyone is already seated. I go around to the other side of the table and find a place to slide in. I'm wearing a dress and sit on the floor. I know that's A MISTAKE. It'll be uncomfortable soon. My man friend comes in and is nervous. He doesn't like committees and meetings, but he's willing to help out. I am seated between a suave, good-looking, vain man and his mother. They are gossiping about women and who he's dated. He sees a name (c:\sherial) on a car and takes it down. He'll call her,;maybe he already had a night with her, he can't remember. Now it's time for my man friend to start the meeting. He's going to sing and dance. He's wearing a woman's tap dance outfit and silly lipstick and wig. He taps and sings beautifully. He's built like Archie. I am smiling at him and winking encouragement. I think he's terrific. The good-looking man gets jealous and tries to grab me and kiss me. I slap him across the face just as my guy is tap dancing around to our side of the table. I know the suave man did that to get my guy jealous so he'd lose his step and ruin the presentation. My guy grabs me and dances with me like its part of the routine. He says, "What's going on?" I say, "Nothing, nothing. Don't worry about it. He just made a pass." He gets jealous and I insist he dance on. He finishes the dance. The suave guy says to me, "What do you see in him?" I say, "He's so talented and interesting and hey, he's got great boobies" (meaning the fake ones he's wearing). "Besides," I say, "you are boring. All you talked about for a half hour was gossip. He's got depth." (480 words)

I go over to a man's house. I am very interested in this man. He comes over to me and says, "Hey, nice to see you, but I'm taking off with the guys. We're going hunting. If you're still here when I get back, we'll get together, OK?" I have this internal feeling that yeah, I intend to be here. I'm going to stick it out as long as it takes. I also realize he's teasing me a bit, knowing I want to be with him and just selfishly taking off. He's rubbing my face in it a bit. I hang out. Later he returns and I am sitting on a couch and he sits next to me. I am aware that he is crazy, and I know I'm being accepted into the "inner sanctum" of his intimates. The phone rings. I answer it and it's for me. Some woman asks for Jiving Joe, and asks me how "the Ladies" went. She meant my Play, "Ladies mayhemming society" and how the rehearsals went, or the performance, I'm not sure which. She's an intimate friend of the man's and is semi-teasing me as well. Now I am leaving, maybe I'm a half-grown boy. The man is crazy and potentially dangerous. He sends a horse after me, to hurt me. I run and hide in a small room and the lock on the door is broken. I try and try to get it to lock. It won't. It's too late to go out and find another place to hide. So I see a smaller room, a closet and get into it. It has a working lock. I notice behind me a smaller enclosure, maybe a utility box that I could squeeze into if I have to. I choose not to for the moment. (301 words)

I see a young teen boy (maybe 17 years old) on a raft in the ocean. He and his animal friends are on a mission, like Johnny Appleseed. There is a dog, a beaver, and other animals, including 87 baby tarantulas. When he began this journey, there had been only one adult. Even though he is a virgin and doesn't know how to make love himself, his job is to find the ducks and help them have sex so they will have baby ducks. I see many little baby ducks swimming around. He helps the female ducks sit on the male duck in the right position so the deed gets done. I know this because a male narrator voice is telling these facts as I see the picture. Now the scene changes and I am talking to a woman. She confesses she had another baby boy after Melvin. Although the woman would be Valerie, logically, it is Ginny. I now get to meet the long lost boy, who is an innocent young teen (as above). He has bright red hair. His name is Douglas. I say, "It's so nice to meet Melvin's half brother." He looks surprised and says, "Half"? I look over at Ginny. "Haven't you told him?" "Sorry." So they talk. I say to him, "I am called Auntie. I am like your Auntie." He formally says, "Hello, Auntie." I invite him to hug me. He does, but it's a bit stiff. Then he melts into a more natural hug. [BL] (252 words)

There is a doctor, then John Laroquette, like Barry S, a doctor-type, and me, a nurse, and we are supposed to work together. The doctor leaves and John is coaxing me to stay and work with him. He loves me and wants me. I am attracted, but he is presuming too much. He has his arm around my waist saying, "And after we have a nice romantic dinner, we can relax and make love all night." I get haughty and say, "Oh, you think so, huh?" Now Fluffy is in my lap and I'm so glad to see her. I pet her and we are happy. Now I see Bitsy Cat is here too. I am surprised, but then I notice she has huge chunks of naked skin where clumps of fur is missing and blood spots. She's injured. I must help her and ask John to help me. He gets a can of antiseptic spray stuff and I try to hold her and spray and now John and I are doing it together and somehow we are laying down together while we are trying to fix the wound on Bitsy Cat.

I am in my wheelchair and so is Derek. We are seated outside a house, where inside are some of my relatives. Derek is holding a baby girl and I am holding a baby boy. We are not speaking because I am hurt and angry at him. My baby boy squirms and fusses and I move him around until I have him seated on my lap facing me and I cuddle him. He settles down contentedly. It's soft and loving. Then my mother comes out and says, "It's time for the presentation." I am annoyed because I want to stay with this warm, loving feeling with the baby. I then hand the baby to a woman and wheel inside. I see a huge room, where many people are seated around in a circle, on ritzy couches and fancy chairs. I look for a good place to put myself so I can see everyone and they can see me. Derek is now on one of the couches. I avoid him, taking great pains to snub him and not give him eye contact. I chose the head of the room, by the huge fireplace. There is also a skeet shoot apparatus up on the wall to my left. Derek encourages the rich man who lives in this mansion to shoot the birdie. He tries a couple of times, but it is all weak and ineffective. A silly coo-coo type mechanical bird flaps his wings, and a sort of pop gun goes off. Now I begin my lecture. I want to keep it informal and answer questions. The topic is dreams. I say, "I know lots of things about dreams and my bias is Jungian, but I don't want to inundate you with all this. Just ask me what you want to know and I'll try to answer it." I am watching the words I use so I don't trigger Derek's automatic responses around 'know-it-all left brain language." Some ask some questions and it goes on. Now it's over and a man, like Richie, Kyle's brother, also a rich man from this mansion, is seated on my right. He is telling me how much he has wanted to meet me because he'd seen pictures of me and I'm fabulous and he loves me and would like to have s-e-x with me. And he goes on like a star-struck fan. I say to him, angry and bitter, "I am 51 years old. You are young. This is stupid and won't work." He ignores me and prattles on and on, very gushy and intense. I want to leave now. Derek is nearby watching. Now I'm on a couch and a bookshelf contraption slides in front of "Walter" and myself to give us some privacy. I want to leave. He grabs me and tries to kiss me. I fight and scream, "Leave me alone, no no!" I break from his grasp, and I see Derek is frantically getting into his chair to come beat up Walter and protect me. I am sobbing violently and deeply. I drive away in my chair to the van and Derek follows. I am screaming, crying and he won't leave me alone. He hangs onto my handles and hitches a ride with me; he is concerned and loving. I am deeply hurt and sad. This Walter, who I don't like and don't want, wants me. Derek, who I love and want, won't have me. It has been this way all my life. It's not fair. I sob and sob, a deep grieving. (591 words)

I make a joke to a woman that I really did a good job with turning on the radio program, when it is a totally automatic job at the radio station. I am in a huge warehouse kind of building. I walk away from her to go to my "room." I turn back around and notice that the van, which I thought I had parked near a wall, had been moved over to another position, AND the vandals had taken off a wheel, stripped off hub cabs and mirrors and so on, which are laying on the "ground"/floor. A spray of water is spurting up from a rupture in the "ground/floor" like a pipe had been broken in the violent dismemberment of my van. I wonder if I should leave there. Maybe I'm in danger.

I am being pursued by two men who wish to marry me. I am taking my time, choosing which one is the right one for me. One man is dark-haired and nice, but not exciting and gorgeous. I am attracted, but not all that interested. I am thinking of rejecting him. I see a house near the ocean where the side yard literally is the ocean. The children of the family are swimming in it and playing on the rocks in the water. It seems so convenient and wonderful. I feel a bit envious. A young 12- or 13-year-old girl is in the water and someone asks her if they can look at her nose, because she'd had plastic surgery done on it. She is annoyed at their curiosity. Now I see the man I had rejected in the front seat of a car. The passenger side is open and I go to speak to him, to be comforting, as he is hurting from the rejections. A young girl, maybe the same one, comes up and wants to hug him and I hold her off, thinking it would be too teasing, as he can't have what he wants. Now his mother drives up and gets out, walking over to us. I say to him, hanging on to him so he won't run, "Here's your mother." I want him to face her. He feels very rejected and hurt by his mother. She is pretty, with bleached blonde hair and young-looking, but she is older, with wrinkles when you look closer. She's very egotistical and self-centered. She has a dress in her hand, one I used to wear, and is offering to sell it to me. I lay it out across him and me to look at it. He is sort of half laying, half sitting on the seat, diagonal, so his feet are toward the open door. I am seated on the edge of the front seat, facing the back seat, sort of. She points out the beaded strands and the young girl is looking closely at the weave so she can make one like it. I decide to defend the man and I grab her, the mother, and the dress and I am marching her back to her car. I start beating her up with the beaded dress, now big wooden beads, and it hurts her. It's like I'm flogging her. I am angry and selfrighteous. She abandoned the man as a boy and she has no business or right hurting him now. I drag her to her pickup truck and make her drive away. Now the scene shifts and I am married to the man. I had seen the errors of my ways and am being caring and committed to him. We run an inn or a restaurant and I have an apron on, I have dark hair and I am saying, "I need to take my husband his dessert now." I am very loving to him and so happy I had seen my mistake and changed. I had almost made a bad decision when I first chose not to marry him. (523 words)

I am in a hospital bed. I am asleep and Dwight comes to my bedside. He is very drunk. I pretend to stay asleep as he tries to talk to me. His drinking buddies try to get him to leave me alone. Finally, he goes to another area. Now I'm playing a violin. I'm playing Christmas carols, "Away in the Manger," and "Oh, Holy Night." At first, it is a bit difficult because of my fingers, then as I continue and practice, I get better and better, not even trying to find the right note, just flinging my fingers and they hit the exact right spot and the most beautiful music comes out. It's sweet violin music. Now a group of interns and the doctor come and surround me on the bed. They are poking and talking and I demand that they stop. I say, "Stop this. Tell me what is going on." They ignore me and I get more insistent and loud. Finally, I get the attention of the doctor, a haughty man, who condescends to listen to me for a moment. I explain how demeaning it is to be ignored. It is my body and I have a right to know what is going on. Now that I got their attention, I let them do the tests, which ends up like a kind of surgery. They make a mistake and I am permanently brain damaged. I am innocent and pliable. Someone decides to marry me because I have great wealth and they want it for themselves. An older man and his son are arguing who will be my groom. I am on the arm of the father. I wear a beautiful, white bridal dress. I vacantly smile and I'm serene. Even though I have some consciousness, maybe my dream self feels worried I'll be hurt and taken advantage of. We are in a vehicle, where I and the two men are in the backseat. The father is on my left and the son is across facing me. I look out the window and see buildings and then see the hospital I had been in and get upset and don't want to see it. I get agitated. Now we are at the place the wedding will take place in. It's a big room. The dancing starts as I sit alone for a moment on a bench. I see three women decide to dance together to start the dancing. They do back flips and strange moves like that. They wear long dresses that are pretty, vibrant and sexy. A man asks his wife to dance and she says, "Not now, here let ____ substitute." It is a boy. The man and the boy dance. I decide I have to go to the bathroom. I get up and wander away. The dream conscious one knows I'll escape this way by getting lost and they can't find me, but the bride doesn't know anything. I go around the back around a building like a grown-over path through an old orchard of trees. I find the shit house, which is filthy and full of shit. I am disgusted by the idea of my white pristine dress being besmirched by all this shit. I go further and see a gate. It's an old wooden one. I open it and go inside. It is a dog kennel. There are lots of large, black dogs, maybe Labradors are being bred there, or housed there. I stand looking. Some men are at the far end. One man -- ugly, large, and mean -- has a double gauge shotgun. He begins to threaten me by pointing it at me and then begins to fire. Bullets hit the wall behind me very close. I am in danger and yet I am still very serene. I wait patiently with just a bit of alarm. Some men try to tell him not to shoot me. He fires the gun at them too, narrowly missing them. Now a beautiful hunk, the hero, in a tan leather jacket, good-looking and capable, comes around the corner. The dream consciousness knows he's the one that will rescue me and I will end up marrying him. He stops the mean guy from shooting at me and the dream fades out, with the dream consciousness knowing it will be a happy ending. (725 words)

I am in a car with Bonnie. We are taking the back road. It is a side road which is parallel to the big freeways. It is scenic, there's hardly any traffic and so it's easier to drive on and I get places faster and more refreshed. We come up to a stop sign where the freeway intersects. Now the car is a small airplane. Jock and another man are in it with me and I say, "Shall I fly the plane?" The man, who is at the driver's wheel, starts giving excuses like it will cost 1.15.7 per gallon for the gas and we'd have to go clear over to the gas station, and so on. I say to Jock, "So, are you afraid of flying?" He says, "No, but I know he is." I realize I'm a bit afraid of doing it myself. If I got up there, how would I find this little patch of home to land in again? What if we fell? Now I go into the house and realize it's different. I liked the other house, the one I had before this, better. There are many rooms and so on, but the other house was more spacious and simple, Danish-like in style. There's baby girl and an older girl. They want their bottle. The men want to feed the babies. Where are the bottles? Howard's in there somewhere. (234 words)

The girls are going to be visiting and I am talking on the phone with Howard's third wife. As we are talking, we are constantly interrupted with noisy situations. At first I am out in the fields, green bean fields, and the crews and trucks are too noisy, so I retreat back into the house, which is spacious and huge. There are several hundred Boy Scouts there, and their parents are coming to pick them up in long train cars, like a zoo train. I retreat further and go down to a laundry room, where a mother of a girl who had been visiting comes to get her girl. We go into the next room, where miles of clothes hang on racks in this opulent closet. Even the visiting girl has a rack of her own. The mother is showing me her cute outfits. I admire them. I move down to another level and I am outdoors in a park-like setting with trees. I look up into the sky and there are flying giant pop bottles and other huge debris flying. I realize I'm so far below the earth level that it appears to be flying above me. I also realize that gravity is working and some of these things are falling down. I look for a safe place to sit. I decide to sit under a fir tree so the branches will protect me. I'm still talking to Howard's third wife. Now I go down another level and find a huge shower room and around the corner a luscious bathtub, rich and expansive. I decide I can get into this tub because there is a ramp-like thing which goes up to it so I can use my knees and get up and down. Dovre is there. I ask Howard's wife if Howard is drinking more, as she is telling me hew has disappeared and is more miserable. Yes, he has a drinking problem. I offer to let them stay in my huge house when they come with the girls for a day or so. I say, "Do you want me to get you a motel room? or will you schedule it? or you can even stay here, if you want." I feel generous. (374 words)

I enter a room, like a store, and Derek/Darryl is there in his wheelchair. I am shy and don't give him much eye contact and connection, even though I love him. Someone is narrating something about how the one who loves and stays learns more and is richer than the one who leaves. It's sort of my thoughts I am directing toward him. I want him to stay and love and learn. He finishes his shopping and rolls out the door. I say wistfully, "Goodbye Derek." He tosses a curt, distant goodbye over his shoulder as he leaves. Now I go into another room, with maybe clothes, maybe Katrina is in there. Now I am in a shopping mall area and see a sweet 6-month-old baby girl in an open store area. I am very happy to see her. She is so cute, innocent, fresh and happy and sweet. I hold her in my lap and am talking to her. I realize she's being sexually abused and I am telling her with empathy that she will have years of hard work ahead of her to learn forgiveness. Her parents are in the store and neglectful. They aren't paying any attention to her. I want to interfere, but know I can't. The girl baby will have to be unprotected and go through this awful pain and she will eventually prevail. There is a dog somewhere around. (235 words)

Different people are asked to write down whether they thought I and this man were to become lovers or best friends or what. These people are couples. I am reading their responses. They've written them at various stations or places in a room. One couple describes how we learn from each other and grow and do things better because we're together. They think we should get on with it and be lovers or a couple. Another has some reservation and says best friends. But the overwhelming majority thinks we'll be a couple. There's lots of curiosity and build-up excitement about revealing the answers. Now one man has applied for a job. We are interviewing him. He's quite qualified and charming, but I don't completely trust him and I'm double checking his materials. I find a black circle. I ask him to verify that he didn't already give copies of these to the woman president of the college in his admission materials. He's suspicious now. I'm on to him. I continue looking for evidence. Someone yells, "Quick, come look here." I go up on the high open roof where there's a stone wall around the edge (like in a castle). I look over the edge to discover he'd placed a ladder there for his escape after he'd killed. I see he's found me and I struggle and push the escape ladder away from the wall as I also struggle against his attack on me. He's got a blue-colored syringe thing with poison in it and he's trying to stab it in my neck. I fight hard, and as I finally succeed in shoving the ladder far enough for it to fall away, he lunges to rescue it, miscalculates and tumbles over the edge, screaming as he falls to his death. I had nearly been killed and I wake up still feeling the fear and racing heartbeat. I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack. (325 words)

I am on a boat. The planet has been changed somehow. Dangerous aliens have come and transformed things. Ellie is sort of the captain. She informs me she is going to go out there and have unlimited sexual encounters and won't particularly care if she protects herself. I take something she'd been hoarding that would enable her to do that and hide it in my leggings. Ellie is pissed at me. She announces we are about to crash full speed into land. I don't even brace myself. I look out the window and see us coming to land. We crash and are now walking. We find a small hill which has triangles and markings and buttons on it and we realize this is the command com the aliens used. Now a woman approaches. She is one of the aliens. Apparently they used to be mechanical, and due to the crash and emergency conditions here, they had to transform into organic material. They are very unused to being in a body. She points to a small rainbow-colored sort of pony-like creature. I ask, "What the heck is that?" "A horse," she says. I laugh, realizing they had taken their concepts of what animals and people are from a child's book of illustrations, an artist's rendition of reality, and copied that. She shows me other animals. We're sort of in this together. (230 words)

I am driving myself to a lecture I will be giving at a rich upperclass church. I am self-sufficient and well-dressed. I get there and get out of the van to see that there is a flight of stairs up to the church. I sit in my wheelchair, waiting for them to come out and get me in. They have to pick me up, four men, and carry me up the stairs to the stage. I know they are embarrassed and am glad they have this visual lesson. I sit proud and tall. I look down at the audience and begin by talking about how huge and spacious the room is and how it dwarfs the audience with its presence. I then tell them how distant they are from the stage and how unusually high the stage is from them. I use this as part of my lecture on how they choose to keep themselves separate and distant. I am honest, forthright and kind. (164 words)

I am privy to being around the President of the United States. He has selected a new cabinet, new things are going to happen, or there is a potential for it to happen. I am introduced to them. They are powerful and I'm not sure if they'll be good powerful or bad powerful. The First Lady comes in and greets a man, one of the new cabinet members, in a old friends kind of way. She waves at his wife, also her good friend. The President introduces her jokingly as the Last Lady. I sit on the floor, cross legged and informal, watching all this and aware that although I am not really a part of it, because I am being permitted to hang around, eventually I'll make my place among them. A woman comes up. I see she has placed a wrinkled brown paper bag on the table near my place setting. I open it and take out a pretty brown and olive green wool suit. I know she is taking me under her wing and is trying to spruce me up, I say, "Thanks," and then say, "but be warned, sometimes I deliberately wear polyester!" To make a statement, I'll dress "inappropriately." (204 words)

I am on a "raft," which is really a wooden box floating on a river. This is some college retreat conference and also a tourist shaman experience. I notice the sides of the box undo at the nails and one side falls off. I broke the raft. I take it to the old woman native. She looks at me and suggests I do the shaman course. I don't really want to, but it could be fun. I go, not fully into it with my heart, mostly curious. Mabel is there somewhere. We are floating down a river past buildings where military personnel are living, working and studying. I see one room with women military personnel in a classroom. I see strong, good-looking men walking around. Now I'm in the river and my teacher's helper is supposed to dive and show me how to retrieve the knives he has dropped deliberately. One knife is huge, a butcher knife. Another one is small, a paring knife. I watch and then I go under water and retrieve a knife. The old woman is impressed with me. I am going to be a shaman.

I now live in M City and trying to make it there in a new environment. I see two women; one makes some special blocks for the other. The other woman's name is Bette Davis. The woman follows her, trying to give her the blocks, saying, "I adore you." Bette Davis isn't accepting this. I wonder if this is lesbian and it doesn't feel like it. Now I am visiting Aunt Naomi who lives in a camper trailer behind my parents' house. Ellie comes in to talk to Aunt Naomi. I recognize she's here to do some dramatic storytelling and really doesn't want me around to spoil her fun. But I stay and listen in as Ellie whispers to her that she's a bit worried because she's been getting into weird practices again. I say, "Oh, you mean wanting to be Catholic." I am guessing, trying to appear as if I know what's up. I had noticed she's been wearing a big cross necklace. Now it is a metal Bible on a chain around her neck. I say, "Or maybe even wanting to be a nun." "No Mom," Ellie says, "I play at hanging myself." It's a ritual sort of fantasy thing. I am shocked and concerned. I say, "Honey, this is sick. Something is wrong with you that needs looking to." She listens, but goes on wanting to talk with Naomi. I pull Naomi aside and say, "Go ahead and listen to her; she needs support right now. I'll take care of doing something later." I then tell Naomi I've been living in M City, to be near the grandkids, but it's not working out. It occurs to me that I could move back to E City and I see my A. Street house and the white apartment as possible places where I could return. Then I say, "I could even move to Dover." Naomi thinks about this and says, "Probably not Dover, too much traffic." I am excited by the idea of moving and reconnecting with new people, new ideas, etc. I go outside to leave and find Aunt Rosalie, Darcy and Deirdre stopping by to visit Aunt Naomi. I ask them where they are headed. They won't tell me. It's like a secret. I am annoyed. They are here to wash their clothes and rest up and then they're on their way. I keep asking them where they're going and how come they won't tell me. Darcy sighs and says "Venita (or Venusian) near E City." It's an indirect hint, but it's the most she's going to say and she's annoyed I keep pressing her. (438 words)

I am a waitress at a cafe. My woman boss is very meek. I tell her to remember she is the boss and I teach her to be assertive. A young couple is at one back table. They are in love. Now the playwright group gathers. Eric has some stuff to share. I see the name "B" on one. He announces he has won a short story contest in an important newspaper. I say, "I am envious," but I also am aware the story is about me, so I'm also happy or curious. He starts to read the story, then pauses and says, "I have finally learned what it takes to write, after all these years. You just write...from the heart." I smile because I knew that and he is absolutely right. I'm thinking this story about me, then, must be emotional and from the heart. This pleases me. Now he reads it. It says "WELCOME, B." in headlines. Then it says, "I find you in many places, in between the thin mucus layers of my ____" (a body part, maybe the nose). "You are in 482 points in my" (another body part), "and in 7008 places in my (stomach lining?)" Then he goes on to describe trees and the (state) scenery and so on. I feel a bit disappointed and comment, "I don't like the ending." It doesn't feel like the story had continuity. How can this story have been good enough to win the contest? (247 words)

I am in a room with Eric and some others, one of them a man in a wheelchair (not Derek, but I like him sort of like Derek). I want to tell them of this amazing coincidence of me having a dream about Nate writing this story about me and then here we are together to talk stories. We are walking down some flights of stairs to find a quiet place to talk. I open a door and see a Hult Center type auditorium with some show going on, on the stage. I close the door. We go down another flight of stairs to find a dingy metal green basement and we go back up that one flight of stairs. We go through the Hult Center door and walk quietly through the hall at the back of the audience to a cafe. We sit. The tables are small, square ones, room for two at each table. Now some other people are with us and I want there to be room for the man with the wheelchair to sit at my table across from me so he can enjoy the dream I'm going to tell. Now my father is seated at the end on the left and my mother at my left. A young couple in love is between my parents. My Aunt Rosalie is on my right. My father comes in smiling with a tray of special desserts he bought for the young couple to honor this moment (of wedding or being in love). It interrupts my starting to tell the dream. We admire and look at what's on the tray -- red and white striped ice cream swirled in a dish, a bottle of what looks like champagne, but my mother looks at the label and we agree it's almost champagne, the cheaper version. My father is smiling, very pleased with himself. I am a bit annoyed, but still trying to get the attention so I can tell this interesting dream coincidence thing. Now I see my father has on some kind of mask which hides his gentle, kind face. I try to speak and he sounds like he wants to hear, but then he interrupts with a story of his own or something and I go quiet. Now Aunt Rosalie is having an argument with Sparky off in another room and I feel angry and put upon. My day is getting spoiled. I feel guilty because my relatives have somehow taken over this day and Sparky is going to be mad at me because we've moved in and not paid our share for the rooms. I didn't mean for this to happen. It's beginning to look hopeless that I'll be able to impress this man in the wheelchair like I'd like to with my fine story. I am frustrated and sad. (473 words)

George and I are in his house. I am visiting. He wants to sketch me. I sit, half lie, on the couch in a restful pose. He sketches. He likes me very much. Now I am walking through the room drinking some milk out of a gallon glass jug. I am going to the refrigerator to put the milk back in. I feel a bit guilty about drinking right out of the jug. Now I walk back through the living room and watch his parents, or somebody's parents, arguing. The teen daughter is mad at them. The mother has her back to us and is telling the stepfather to leave. This makes the teen daughter happy. I walk past and am touring the house. I see a large room with lots of spacious windows. The river, brown and muddy is swirling in and rising. I am a bit concerned, but not too much. Perhaps it won't rise so high as to enter the rest of the house. I see an elephant swimming in the river, in the room, and two alligator/part human creatures wrestling each other. I walk on and see an adjourning room, George's brother's room. It too is semi-flooded. Now George is showing me his room. He opens the door and I see a narrow, long, empty closet. I try to see a bedroom. I pull back a cloth, perhaps tie-died, to peek behind it and only see the wall with old wallpaper on it. But now it opens up and is his bedroom. There are plants, a living tree, and huge sky windows in the ceiling. I look up and see huge piles of junk, mostly empty cardboard boxes, empty wine bottles and so on, hanging upside down. I say to George, "Hey, is that really up there above my head, or is this just a perspective, point of view thing" He says, "It's just the perspective." I am relieved. I now walk through back door, a lovely glass door, and see the outside. I see a pond, which is a continuation of the river, less muddy. There's a marker rope and then the pond widens out into a lake where recreation things are happening -- little paddle boats, swimmers, etc. I start to walk over there, but George comes out, perhaps in a wheelchair, and says to me,"Wait. Stay with me. I love you." (398 words)

Nightmare. I have red, white and blue poker chips and these black men are trying to take them from me. I run away and dive in the river. I swim just to the left of the other woman captive, only I am just under the surface of the water. I know it is a good, safe spot for me. They are looking for me. They will rape and hurt me if they find me, and take away my poker chips. (80 words)

My cousin Terence is flirting with me. He'd wrestle gently and I'd accidentally fall back on the floor and he'd "fall" on top of me and we'd sneak kisses and so on. It was very pleasant and I knew vaguely it wasn't right, but it was so delicious, I didn't work hard to avoid it. He was an adventurer, a wanderer, and was home for a short while. I was working on a play. (74 words)

I am married to Howard and have a baby. I am deeply angry at him. I won't let him speak to me. He tries to apologize and make up, but I won't let him. Even though I am bitterly angry, I continue to do my work. I sweep, mop, hang up clothes, and take care of the baby. I am a good wife, but angry. (65 words)

I read a book that took me along time to get into, but after I kept at it a while, became interesting. It is a series of vignettes about towns, the last one being Mapleton. Now I decide to move to Mapleton. I am biking down the old highway and see a lovely stretch of grass and decide to bike across the "moors" for fun. It's very pretty and pastoral. Now I am in town and finish my errand and am biking back to my new home. My front wheel keeps getting caught in the old grooves of the asphalt and it pulls me a bit, so I struggle to keep on the road. I manage. I cross a bridge. I see I have a long way to go, maybe eight miles. I hope I get home before dark. I'll be tired, but oh well, it's a pretty ride and an adventure. I am munching on carrot sticks. As I approach a railroad crossing, the red lights come on. I know I'm supposed to stop, but I don't. I slow down and look and then scoot across anyway. At the last track to cross I look up and realize the train is almost upon me. I get across and then see the crossing guard bar. I think, "How silly of me to have forgotten they'd be down, how will I get by?" Then I see a way to sneak around the end. I am hearing the nuns chant as they go to seek answers or information from a young mystic girl. She was called a "pronuncio." She keeps repeating over and over, "You can not be plotted. You cannot be dated." [BL] (281 words)

I have a big, rotting black space on my back teeth. Food is lodged there and a cavity is there. I keep picking at it and bits come out. Finally two teeth have fallen out and chips have been removed. I have a hard time getting my jaw to open enough to inspect it and work on it, but this time as I look, I see the teeth are hard and white and fixed. My work had a positive result. I comment to someone that since I'd chosen to sit in the high chair with the toddler baby girl, I'd been able to take better care of my teeth and they got better. The little girl is lively and cute. The high chair is an old-fashioned, little thin metal one. (130 words)

I am trying to clean up the messy floor. There is lots of dust and dirt and lint and so on. I start with a broom and realize all that sawdust will be hard to do with a broom, so I get a vacuum cleaner as well. I'm working hard to clean it all up. [BL] (55 words)

I am at a cabin at the ocean on the front porch. I see a mother cat and her baby kittens, white and black, sort of spotted, striped. I sit and hold one kitten and cuddle it. It is very sweet and cute. Derek wheels out. He's a bit pudgy in the middle, sort of a comfortable teddy bear kind of guy, and I put my head in his lap and we are very happy, sitting together playing with the kitten. It is soft and comfortable. Then it is time to go, to move on, and we go inside to clean up before we leave. The floor is a mess: dust balls, dirt, lots of stuff. I am sweeping with a broom. Derek is trying to clean the floor also. The landlord comes in and is annoyed and gruff, saying we haven't cleaned it all up yet. I am angry at him and we have words. The dream sort of fades out at this point. (165 words)

I am somewhere, inside. Derek had been there and had just left. I see Lisa (playwright) and she is dancing playfully with a very close girlfriend. They kiss. I wonder for a moment if they are lesbian. A man nearby doesn't approve. I need to find a bathroom. I'm at a University, maybe a building like Autzen Stadium. I go down lots of halls looking for an accessible bathroom. Then I see a book stall where they sell writing things. I see the pens and am now looking for the right pen. I see the cheaper ones and hope to find a good-feeling pen there, but am drawn to the really pretty ones that are more expensive, fountain pens with clicker tops and feathers attached to the cap. They are special pens to be used at special occasions where there are guest books to be signed. But I will use this pen for my writing. I test it out and like the way the wet ink looks on the paper, only it spots a few blue ink marks on my hand. I kind of like that, a mark of a writer. Then the ink thins out and it's scratchy on the paper. Maybe this is the demo pen and I could find one that writes more consistently better. I find a colorful one with iridescent colors, but it has a kind of rough, scratchy feeling when I try it. No good for me. Needs to be a smooth ride. (249 words)

A couple started their relationship very loving and richly caring. Then it became fighting and distant. I come into the house and see fettucine on the floor, not cleaned up. I go in and am wishful of the beginning time again when things were loving. Now I am in the streets, trying to find City Hall, the City Planning Department. I guess I need a permit or something. Another woman, perhaps a sister, and I are lost. I see a building and go over to it and realize this is it. I go in. There are marble floors, fancy signs, etc. I see the directory. I can't make out what floor the department is on. I go to the elevator and get in, determined to go to each floor, although I think it is maybe 4th floor or 9th floor. A young man comes into the elevator backwards with an old ritualistic step, like a hop (Raymond like feet). I get out and have found the office. My sister Lydia is there and a man. I am looking around the nearly empty room thinking this would be a great room to do my writing in. I go to a window with an attic-like enclosure structure around the window, which makes an alcove, and think, "This would be where I'd love to put my writing desk." I go there and notice that when I sit there, I can see a lovely view of an old Victorian house out the other window. Now the man is in love with Lydia and we are wearing old-fashioned long silk dresses (1800's). She has black hair tied up in ringlets and mine is blonde. The man wants us to go to his house. We do. He is very rich and the house is a Victorian mansion. He introduces Lydia to his mother; they try on a bridal gown for her. I try to take a picture of her and look through the lenses of her glasses to take the picture. One lens is scorched and scratched from her having looked through it. I look at her through it and say, "Too bad the colors won't turn out well. I guess I'll take the picture just to have a memory snapshot. It won't be a good picture." I snap the picture and finish the roll of (reel?) film. I start to open the back of the camera too quickly. I hope I didn't ruin the picture. Now Lydia and the man's mother go out of the room to make arrangements for the wedding. The man comes over to me; he also secretly loves me. I am aware of his feelings and try to deflect or ignore them. I look out the window as he tries to press his face near mine and tries to turn my face so he can kiss me. Finally I say, without giving him much eye contact, "You love my sister, sir. This cannot be." He is sad. He now wants to give me a tour of the house. He goes down to the end of a hall and opens a door. I look in. It's a bedroom, fairly modern and ordinary looking. There are two beds, one with a yellow bedspread, one with a blue-green one. I say, shocked, "Why have you shown me a private room?" I realize it is his bedroom. I turn and start to walk away, down the hall. He goes into the room and comes back out hurriedly with a small box that has a bird egg collection. It was his when he was a boy. I am touched. Then Lydia and his mom returns and he hurriedly covers the bird's egg collection with a piece of cloth so they won't see. Somehow this is too intimate for our relationship. Lydia is carrying a huge tray with goblets and things on it. It is too heavy for her and I see from her eyes she is on the verge of being hysterical. He takes the tray from her to help and I say to him, "Take care of her," and I leave the house. I am vaguely aware they are going to send out their car to take me home, but I don't know for sure, so I hesitate and look around. I see a big square limo (more shaped like a hearse, only more box-like). It is picking up or leaving off a young woman in a wheelchair; must be the neighbors. I start to walk. I stop and hesitate again looking back. I see a regular, but fancy car. Maybe that's it. A woman comes around the porch of the neighbor's house and I offer to buy a candy in her tray for a ruble. I see a second boxy limo and walk back. Another woman comes over and says in an angry haughty voice that she is appalled I would offer a ruble to the neighbor woman, thinking she was the maid. Something about not being in my own class and putting on airs. (841 words)

I am going to N City. I am driving a car and am alone. First I am lost. I can't remember which way to turn, left or right. I decide left, then there are many lanes of fast traffic and as I speed up to merge, I don't do well. A white car is forced to speed up and leap over me. A second car grazes my fender. I am concerned because I could be in real danger here, I almost had two car wrecks. I come to another turn, then a bridge construction where a man holds up a stop sign. I put on my brakes (I had spelled it breaks!), but am not slowing down fast enough. My Grandma Agnes is a passenger and someone else is in the back seat. They are trying to brake also. We are concerned. I pull to the right so I don't crash into the other cars and end up stopped way over the stop line. I am embarrassed at my driving skills. I continue on, a bit lost again.

Ellie is going away for a few days and I decide to go to N City for the day and then put myself in a foster care home for a few days until Ellie returns. I am curious what it would be like and it would be nice to be taken care of. Ellie warns me to take the back streets out of town because the main street is clogged with traffic because of a football game or something. I try to, but get all twisted around and find dead ends and odd corners and end up going out of town the wrong way, up over the mountains toward M City (I think I'm in M City). I try to find a place to turn around, but that will put me in the traffic jam. Then I realize the game is started because the traffic has freed up some. I stop by the foster home to check in. The helpers are very busy with the other patients. Two colorful cowboy hats (huge) with little short puppet like legs keep darting in and the helpers keep chasing them away playfully. They are dancers. Two of the helpers are choreographers of dance. I see a table with color pens and markers on it. I realize I'd forgotten to pick up Charla to take to N City with me. I decide to call her and then go back and get her. I try to get Ellie's number out of my electronic address book. I type in "B" and it keeps being mistyped with extra letters. I repeatedly try to do it and am unsuccessful. I finally realize I'm in the wrong search mode. I also realize this isn't the right place for me. They do too much help; they are used to patients with severe difficulties and I'm really quite self-sufficient. I am a bit embarrassed. As I am leaving, one woman has penciled in art work on her white smock or blouse. I comment on them. She has started to color them in. I comment on the brilliant purple and orange colors. I like them. If I stayed, I'd probably want to use those coloring pens and draw something. As the woman goes out ahead of me, she's saying she won't be here Monday night, and I know that I won't be coming back here. I'm going home after my N City visit. I feel good about this decision.

I am seated in an easy chair and a small, deformed baby girl is trying to move around near me. I reach out to touch her lovingly and encouragingly. She doesn't want to be touched. Her eyes are puffy, wrinkled small like a burn victim, and lots of burn scars on her tender, hurting body. She pulls back and I say gently to her "It's all right. I won't touch you if you don't want." I smile. She keeps close and wiggles around so that she is actually permitting us to be nearly touching, shyly letting me be close. I keep talking lovingly and then she reaches out and pulls herself on to me. I must touch her to keep her from falling and only do it gently and with intent to support her own movements, never as a holding or a restriction. I am very happy she lets me do this. Then she sees another baby, a newborn, laying on the chair near me. It too looks oddly deformed, sharp, pointed head, elfin ears. She wants to touch the baby. I help her move over there, at one point needing to pick her up and adjust her position so she can get where she obviously wants to go. I apologize to her encouragingly so she knows I'm only doing what she will permit. Then she opens her mouth and tries to swallow the baby's head, out of curiosity, only now it's not a baby but some tiny toy yellow plastic shoes like for a doll. I am a bit concerned she'll swallow them and get hur, but she's all right. Then Ginny is seated to my right and she says, "I can't ever hear your American Woman play without only hearing you. I laugh and say, "I understand. Mirabelle can't either. Both of you know me so well you can't hear the universality of it." She agrees. I laugh suddenly as I am now aware that there are a number of cute fuzzy cats with beautiful eyes all looking right at me as I am speaking. I say to Ginny, "Oh, this is so great. Look, there are..." and I count up to thirteen, then add fourteen so it won't be an unlucky number. I repeat, "There are fourteen cats staring at me right now." I laugh richly at the beauty and fun of it. (396 words)

I go over to Derek's house, worried, because he had called and asked me to come over and I knew he was in trouble. I get to the door and it has been kicked around so that it is in three thin sheets. I get in and see papers and stuff strewn all around. He'd been throwing and breaking things. I say, "Hello." He calls out, "Here." He's in the bedroom. I go down the hall and go into the bedroom. Instead of a regular bed, he is wrapped up in a wet suit material like sack. He's plugged into a sort of bathtub bed. His face is entirely covered with a blue plated mask. I can see an eye peek out and a bit of his tousled hair. He is writhing in pain and sadness. I sit down on the foam, wet sack, and try to stroke him to help calm him. I haven't a clue what part I'm touching, maybe below the break where he can't feel it, or up on his chest. I soothe him and tousle his hair a bit as he wiggles and squirms around, groaning. He lightly kisses me back, near my breasts, and is trying to acknowledge my presence. It is hard for him. I am wearing a pair of shorts, dark blue, and a summer blouse. Sometimes I am naked. It is semi-sexy and very intimate, but the purpose is to assist him through this bad time. He tries to put more warm water into the sack he's in and I feel the coolness leave the sack and it is warm. Then he unplugs his catheter bag down by his feet, which is plugged into the tub drain. (286 words)

I am in a room where lots of activities are going on, like ladies playing cards at a table, and two women seated, reading, etc. I am there to have a session with my psychiatrist. I call him Dwight. He says to me, "I don't feel comfortable with you calling me by my first name so informally. I prefer you call me Dr._____ because you are a very repressed woman and it would embarrass me to be out socially or in public and have people think we are friends." He then hesitates about wanting to do the session in this room because of all the other people. I want that session, so I efficiently go over and pick up the table the ladies are at and walk it out the door, forcing the ladies to follow so they can finish their card game. I then go to the two women in easy chairs and say to them, "Please try to read more quietly." I feel pretty good about taking care of the situation. I remember the doctor had a tuft of gray hair on one side of his face, maybe his left as he faces me. Others had that same kind of tuft of hair. It's like a bushy sideburn, only growing out of his cheek. (216 words)

A native American man is telling a story in some auditorium. I listen. He comes up to me later and wants to meet me and get my opinion. He likes me intensely. I have two daughters who are sleeping on a pile of coats. This is a pow-wow kind of thing. He kisses me passionately. He wants me. I am very attracted and turned on, but I hesitate and say, "I have to take the girls home." He says, "We can find a place for them to sleep here." He says, "We don't have to make love now, or anything, but please just stay." He says it with such strong need and desire and love for me. I kiss him passionately. I will stay. (124 words)

It is dream night. Some new people have come. Derek tells his dream. I'd heard this one before and remind him of a detail he'd left out. Then I begin to tell my dream. Just then, lots of people, all dressed up for a fancy party, come in and now the woman who is new to the dream group is decorating my fancy, ritzy apartment for a party. It's her friend's birthday. I am shocked and upset. She simply takes over and very quickly the place is crawling with strangers and the music is blaring and the decorations are all over. Derek says to me, "I don't know about you, but if it were me, I'd be extremely pissed." I pace back and forth, back and forth, angry, and yet, look at all the trouble they went to. It's so big it would be impossible to get them out and they'd be angry at me. I pace some more. Derek hands me a bottle of drink and I take swigs off it as I pace. I ask what it is because I can't taste it. He says, "It's apple juice." Now I am walking through the rooms, watching, my eyes blazing in anger. I go to my bedroom. Derek sees in my face that I'm about to go ballistic and he loves it. He's grinning from ear to ear and following me around. I go into my bedroom and check to see if any of my jewelry had been taken. Then I find a couple making love in my bed and I start screaming, "Everybody out. The party's over!" I grab women by the hair and drag them to the door. I start ripping down decorations and wires to music speakers. I grab a microphone from the party MC and tell everyone to get out. "This is my apartment and no one asked me permission to have this party and it's over." I am getting them all out as they bitch and complain and get sullen. (336 words)

I wake up in a double bed, at Nate's house. He is standing at the side of the bed saying, "Wake up, Barb, look at what I got you." I open my eyes sleepily and look to see the bed is covered with lots of coins, mostly quarters. It is Nate's little joke gift for me. I am very aware of his mother at the end of the bed suspiciously watching my reactions. I remain calm and noncommittal. Somehow, I am their guest for the weekend. My father is around somewhere. I get up, trying to be casual. Nate is now standing at the other end of the room, leaning against the wall talking to his girlfriend. I feel like a fifth wheel. I am uncomfortable. Later, we have a quick moment of aloneness to talk as I try to find my two purses in the airplane to carry with me so no one will steal my money. We can't touch or kiss as his mother is lurking around watching. (170 words)

I am sitting on a rocking bench in a coffee house, cafe. Listening to a group of singers. The woman singer screws up and has to start the song over a number of times. it's OK. Nobody seems to mind. I sit there alone. A man, lean, skinny, a bit of a day growth of beard comes over and sits next to me. We'd met once before, he reminds me. We talk a bit and slowly he comes closer and I open to him and now I'm almost sitting in his lap, my arm around his neck and the feeling is tentative. I wonder if he's just making the moves, but I like him. We are rocking the bench. He says, "Look." I say, "At what?" He says, "Look," and looks over to the left side of the bench where a small disk drive from my computer is sitting. When we rock, it makes the disk drive lights come on and off (yellow and green). I chuckle. He then asks me if I want to go to Coffee Joe's or some other coffee bar. I am interested, but I say, "I don't like coffee, sorry." He says something like, "Well, I've been thinking of giving it up." We smile. He nibbles gently on my arm. We rock some more. Then he says, "Do you like your____?" I say "What? I couldn't get the word you said." He repeats the question at least three times because I'm not understanding the last word. He repeats it again. "Vidas," I say, "what's that?" He says, "Your tapes." I decide that means my writing. I shrug and think for a moment. I say, "Yeah, most of it, I do. Some of it is shitty, especially the earlier stuff. But I'm going to be rewriting it, making it better." I say to him gently, "And you? I'll bet you're the creative type." He closes his eyes and I see a look of pain and longing. I understand this. He is creative, but can't get to it, or doesn't do it, or doesn't believe in himself. I touch his face affectionately. Now we are interrupted by two young people, his friends. The scraggly teen boy makes sign language gestures. They are telling him it's time to go. The boy then says, "You always get the girls." The man smiles a bit sadly. It's true, he always gets the girls, but so what? He then kisses me and I return the kiss, but it is not all that pleasant. I am disappointed a bit, a kiss open-mouthed without much good response. Oh well. He's leaving now. (439 words)

A heavyset man with a black beard, a "bear" of a man, is traveling by horse across a southwestern desert. His horse is carrying secret listening devices from the CIA to spy on him. He doesn't know they are there. Now I am a young woman in a long dress (1800's) on a horse and he is taking me across the desert. He had gotten off his horse and peed. I could see the shadow of his back and hear the water hit the ground. Then he sits to have a bowel movement. Then he realizes the CIA devices are on the horse and removes them. Now I am sick with fever or heat stroke. The man is now sort of Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford/Derek) and he takes off my many layers of socks, five or six he counts, and shakes his head because that is too stupid in this environment. He strips off my clothes and lays me on a blanket, naked, and covers me with another blanket. But now he is sexually aroused because I am pretty and naked. He takes all his clothes off and stands near me. I can't see his penis, but it's there. Then he lays down on me. I am on my tummy and our skins touch and it is soft and gentle, but I am very afraid. I beg him to please leave me alone. He is hot with desire and yet knows this is wrong to take advantage of me, so he just lays there wanting me and feeling our skins touch, but not doing much else. I don't know if he's going to be honorable and I beg and cry in fear. I feel the tip of his hard penis on my leg and then he stands up and leaves me alone. I fall into a fevered sleep. He takes care of me. (313 words)

I am in a huge ranch house. I live there. I am walking back through the rooms. Perhaps I heard some noise that makes me think someone is prowling around. As I pass through a series of large rooms, I notice a man in an alcove where a telephone booth is. He's not supposed to be there. I go to him and demand he leave. He's some reporter from National Public Radio (NPR) wanting to interview some things that are going on around my ranch house. I am not interested in these events, nor am I happy he's around. I tell him to leave and try to lock the window screen. I realize there are a lot of windows that are part way open and so on. It would be impossible to get him out if he kept trying to get in. He goes out to his crew. I go back to the main living room where my "dad" sits in a chair and I see a lunch pail or file box by him and realize this sneaky man has gotten permission from my father to not only do his news stories but to be in the house. I am very upset. I've decided I really don't like this good-looking man. He is in the other room, at the doorway, listening to me, smiling, because he likes me. He likes my feistiness too. So I now know he's going to be around and there's nothing I can do about it. I grudgingly go sit on the couch next to him, which is the first sign that I am realizing I do like him and am attracted to him. He is Republican and I am Democrat, but I have the feeling he is starting to make a decision to change as he is getting fed up with the Republicans. He has a packet of material, a press release kind of thing, political. He's signing his signature. A man (maybe the "dad") watches how he signs his name and does some in imitation to help him out. I go look at the signature, which is a wild scribbling in black ink, then a series of pastel colored hash marks in a sort of vague flower shape. I notice that each time he does his signature, it is uniquely different. I start to do some of the packets for him, imitating his signature. (400 words)

I am in the M City house. I am talking to Ellie and I suddenly remember that I have a pretty white cat with cocoa brown ears in a cage upstairs and I haven't remembered her for weeks. Perhaps she has died for lack of food and water. I feel horrible. I say to Ellie that usually my helpers fed her, but lately I haven't needed so much help and I just forgot about feeding the cat. I feel like a murderer. I go quickly upstairs and I'm suddenly surprised to remember that my parents had remodeled this upstairs bedroom area before they moved out and left the house to me. I go into the big bedroom and I'm surprised to see how changed it is and realize I've lived in the house for months and haven't even gone up here to look. Somehow, perhaps Ellie went up and got the cat or whatever, but now she is out of her cage and seems to be fine. Maybe her legs are a bit shaky from lack of exercise and the confinement of the cage. I am grateful she is alive. My other cats, a black fuzzy one and another white one, only with light brown paws and lower legs, are all playing together. I am happy they get along so well. Now, I look around the room. It's quite large, painted off-white and there's a fireplace on one wall. I try to remember what it looked like when I was a child and I lived there, thinking my bed used to be in that corner. I turn to the right and see the bed, a double bed, and two fireplaces and a gas stove-like thing in between. There are fires burning in them and I am again surprised and upset with myself. This has been untended for months. It could have burned the house down. I wonder how it kept going so well so long and decide they are gas fireplaces. I see a control box and try to read the instructions so I can turn off the fires. I wonder if I should let them continue to burn, because it must help heat up the house. I notice the ceiling, which is not finished. There are holes between the boards. This part of the remodel apparently never got finished. I see objects on the ceiling above the bed, and lay down to see what my parents wanted to see when they were lying down. An old musket rifle, another rifle, and a strange fox hunt horn like thing are on the ceiling. "That's weird," I think. Then my father comes into the room and asks if I want the air adjusted. I say, "Sure." He gets a stick (pole) and reaches up to a high shelf to manipulate something. I watch so I'll know how to do it. Then I see a mirror and see my mother reflected. She is painting a picture. I turn to see where she should have been from the reflected image, which would be the wall where the fireplaces are, only she's not there. I step closer to the mirror. This is really weird. She's in there, or maybe it's a window to another room, only now it's not my mother but some man painting. I turn back to look at the room and see several more people are there. I see my mother and suddenly with horror I realize it's not her, nor is that man my father. Aliens are there in human form. They start to surround me. I see a younger man coming closer. A woman is in front of me and they say, "Your face is changed too." I now have a hand mirror and see with horror it is not my face. The lips are pointed, like Patricia's. I'd rather have my own face back. I liked it better. I strike the approaching woman with the hand mirror across her face and this hurts her. She stumbles back. The man approaches and I hit him. I realize I can hurt them and in the confusion I run for the stairs. I managed to get to the living room, with the man right behind me. He nearly has me and I keep hitting him with the mirror, using the handle to poke him in the groin as well. I dash outside to the street, cross the street, still hitting at the man and screaming, "Help, help." Finally a bunch of cars and pickup trucks stop and people are getting out to help me. The man runs away. I realize I can't tell them the truth about what happened. They'll think I'm crazy and put me away. I also realize it's going to take some getting used to being this other person, with this other face. I wake up, hearing that cry for help, "Help, help," still echoing in my mind. (820 words)

I am now in a huge, enclosed place, like a mall, only the aliens are all over the place, killing and torturing people. One family of aliens in human form live in a house in this mall-like place. I and my husband, Michael Keaton, are their slaves. We watch their children for them. We are trying to think of ways to escape. I realize suddenly that maybe the reason they hurt us so easily without any care or concern is that they cannot feel pain and therefore do not know what they are doing to us, that they are causing us such suffering. We know that somehow we have to get them to feel the pain. I strike at the woman and Michael tries to hurt the man. Finally the woman feels some pain and starts to understand. She is upset now that they are hurting us and assures me I was a good caretaker for their children. Michael and I run. We see that there is sleet or hail falling outside and we know we must get these aliens out there to feel that, maybe slip and fall or feel it hitting them. We run through the mall halls and they all give chase. We duck into a series of rooms, and Michael comes out of one room with the alien woman saying in a dazed and stupidly happy way, "God, the sex was great." I realize he'd actually stopped in the middle of all this crisis and had sex with the alien. He says to her, "Now how about I rub your _____, a bony part of the back, which is how they have sex." I am not happy about all this, but it is more important to get these aliens outside, so I get Michael's attention and he comes out of his euphoria. We run more, get split up I signal to him, "I'm going down this hall," and he is blocked from me by aliens and he hand signals he understands and will meet me later. I run down a huge flight of stairs. I don't want to fall because then I'd feel the pain, not them. I get to the outside door only to see that there are gang thugs out there and the cops are not going to be helpful. I chance it and run through the alley, only to find myself in another enclosed mall space. I keep trying to get out to the open air. (413 words)

I am in Derek's house and it is dream group time. I see a woman standing with her back to me and I say, "Hi, Lisa." She turns and it isn't Lisa. I feel embarrassed, especially since that might make Derek know I was thinking about him and Lisa. Derek decides to go to the grocery store. Then an overweight man sits on the couch and I sit next to him and then Eric comes and sits on my right. It's very cozy. I am explaining to them what we did at the last meeting that they had missed. I am telling them and then I ask for my notes. Derek is back and he hands me my note pad. I open it and laugh realizing that I thought I'd written words but I had only drawn pictures to remind me. That's not going to help the people who weren't there. Then I pick up another note pad and see writing. I try to read it, but I see I've only written a few words or phrases to remind me. One says, "Three strikes and you're out," then a space and then two other words, "jerk" and another word. I say to the overweight man, "I can't remember what this was about." Derek comes up to me with a silly grin on his face and I say, "What's with the Kirk Douglas grin?" I then look over next to him on his right and see the real Kirk Douglas. Derek had met him in the grocery store and brought him home to meet us. Kirk is interested in me and is flirting. Derek is a little jealous of that and of how I let those two men sit so close to me on the couch. (295 words)

I am on a big motorcycle (probably a Harley Davidson). I am going down a highway and coming to a bridge. A man on a motorcycle is in the left lane and I feel like racing him so I speed up. He's pretty fast. Then I notice a racing course across the river and I turn right, off the highway and down to the wooden bridge with a break in the middle, for the motorcycle to jump. I rev up and go like hell, leaping over the expanse of water and then landing in the mud and sand trap set there to make the course really difficult. I squirrel around in the mud and sand cleverly, "riding" the ruts left there by other bikers. I am very successful and the head biker is watching with appreciation and interest. He wants to know who I am, so he starts to follow me. I ride away fast to try and lose him. I end up at the University, where I teach, get off the bike, and changed clothes real fast and go up to my classroom and teach. When I return to the bike, he and his biker cronies are there waiting for me to return so they can meet me and know who I am. I hide and listen in to their conversation. I am attracted to the head biker and finally reveal myself to him. We make love. It feels great. (241 words)

I am talking with Howard about arrangements for the Christmas party. It's a big annual event and I already bought my pretty blue formal gown. Howard says he doesn't know if he wants to go. He'll be busy teaching and can't get there until 10:00 at night. Half the party will be over by then. I sigh. I say, "Oh well, I'm still going." I then am talking to Lucy on the phone. She is sighing and saying she doesn't know if she wants to go to all the work and trouble of going to the party. I am pouring kayo syrup over Rice Krispies and eating it all with a spoon. It is thick and too much syrup, but very, very sweet. I say, "Yeah, I know. I'm not sure why I'm going either. Howard won't be there until late, so I'll be alone. I don't like the people there. They are so correct and so judgmental all the time. I kind of like to do things differently, my own way just to annoy them, but it is tiring hearing their point of view all the time. MAYBE I'll FLIRT WITH THIS CUTE MAN I know. After all I've already got the dress." Then Lucy says, "Maybe I'll stay home and write a book with all my accomplishments and projects all in the book, so at least they'll all be together in one place. It's like Justin doesn't appreciate or even know what all I've done." I say, "Yeah, good idea. My father did that this year. He just wrote up a sort of autobiography of this year's doings and gave it to all of us family. It's kind of neat he's doing that. Guess he's getting old now and does what he wants to do no matter what other people think of it." (305 words)

I am traveling across the semi-desert badlands. I come upon a fighting circle of Indians. I am surrounded. It isn't my fight, but I am curious about the black feathers tied to the reins of a black horse. I recognize them and wonder if they belong to an Indian I know. I decide to steal the pony and leave the dangerous fighting area. An Indian, my friend, is mad at me for abandoning them there. I ride away and look out over the vista, miles and miles of, and I look forward to a long hard ride to another mesa where a town is. It's exploring time, vacation. I ride hard and long. As I approach the town, I get a phone call from Archie. He is upset with me and wants to talk, but he won't come to the point. I get off the horse and walk with him into the Parks and Rec building where we've danced contact improv before. He is near tears, very intensely upset and emotional. I am calm and caring and also wanting him to say what he really thinks. I am also a bit smiling because I think he won't admit that he, as the director, is upset because we are branching out on our own. He says, "I've heard that some dancers are "_____" and uses a word, a special dance term, that means "moving the move" in contact improv language. I smile and say, "And what's so wrong?" He won't really say. I never help him out by saying, "Yes, we've decided to try some dancing on our own, but that doesn't mean we are betraying you." It feels like he feels betrayed and abandoned. He walks a circle around me and around me as he talks. The carpet is uneven and makes it hard for me to keep my balance. Some people come in and interrupt, so I say, "Let's go into the next room." We do; it has a gym floor. I am relieved and say so. I can keep on my feet more steadily that way. Now we're semi-reclining on a couch. I have my hand sympathetically on his arm. He talks around the issue, but I wait for him to say, "I feel hurt and betrayed and I love you and you went off without me and I'm the director and you shouldn't do that to me." He then says he's been thinking of cutting Emery and Bonnie off soon anyway. I know that's just a defensive move and try to gently argue with him that that's not fair. (432 words)

I am reading a report that Millie made for me as her job as my publicist. It is too wordy and doesn't focus on what I want it to. She comes up all happy to see how I liked her report. I sit down and start explaining. I say, "It's great, really, but look, these first two sentences about men's voices and women working for democracy and motherhood, that's the first thing the people will read and this isn't what I'm trying to say. I want them to know about my creativity and my works." She explains why she thought that was a good idea and why she started the report that way. Then I point to the picture of Ellie and Charla and a bunch of other people and say, "You spend pages talking about them and my relationship with them, but that's not the point. My creative projects are the point. People don't know this is my daughter and my granddaughter." Millie feels a bit defensive and I'm trying not to hurt her feelings. Now I watch a woman, like Sally Fields, all cute and perky, who is going into a big office place to retrieve a doll for her daughter. The man boss is asking her questions about her creative talents. She shrugs and says she's too busy with making this doll for her daughter. The man looks at the Raggedy Ann doll and sees it is well made and says, "How did you make that?" She says, as she struggles to put the good one up on the window with sticky stuff on the forehead, "I just saw the pattern and then made it." The man is impressed with her skill, but the woman isn't even focusing and doesn't realize she has any talent. (298 words)

Fred Astaire is married to another woman. But it isn't working out. I like him and am trying to encourage him to break from old patterns. He is shy and used to routine. There are a bunch of teens he is trying to teach. They are surly and unruly. I am going to go to the opera with Fred, and as we walk down a hall, I hug him, leaning him up against the wall and cuddling. He feels a bit strange and doesn't respond, although he likes it. He is after all still married to the other wife even though he doesn't love her any more. Now we're in the auditorium. He's being loving and trying to encourage the teens. Women are talking about me behind my back. I interrupt them and try to involve them in some sort of gesture game. They start to like me a bit more. Off in the distance, the actors are singing away. Now it's a sort of prison and the guards are after the teens and Fred. I call him Freddie. I sneak into a room where I see Freddie's things arranged like at an altar, only it's at a small sink, few metal round things and some seashells. I decide to put a few of these things down the garbage disposal, realizing he'll probably be upset with me, but somehow this will be more safe for him if I get rid of these things. Only I realize that metal things in a garbage disposal are noisy and will not stop being ground up so it will call attention to the room. I feel a bit stupid. I should have realized that before I plopped them in. (285 words)

I have a lot of boxes and bags, of groceries and things. I see Curtis Salgodo and he's telling someone that his brothers have decided not to play with him any more as backup band. He'll have to go on alone or with a new backup band. I go up to him and say that I know he can do it, because many years ago, when I began my Masters program, I first saw him with the Night Cats (which should be Nighthawks). He begins to chat with me. I am very pleased, as I am a big fan and in awe of him. He is being nice and interested in me. He asks what my disability is. I say Rheumatoid Arthritis and talk about how I was walking then and danced all night with a brace and a cane. I realize I am building the story a bit, to get him to be in awe of me, or maybe feel a bit sorry for me and hang around a bit more. (172 words)

I am driving a car up a windy mountain road and park it next to my father's car as he was coming down the road. We are way off in the hills where scruffy hillbilly people live. I see an old rundown house and remark, "I've seen this kind of house before, as in my childhood, maybe living in them." I go in and a man and a woman, the sister to the woman who lives in the house, is being critical and judgmental. She doesn't like the way her sister does things and is telling her. The sister is angry and not responsive. I act as a negotiator and say to the sister "Look, you hit first. So of course, she has to hit back." The sister doesn't understand that her negative critical remarks are as harsh as attacking physically. (141 words)

I am either on a campus, or in an apartment building, in a long hall and Lucy is arrogantly snotty and angry. She yells swear words at the office people. I walk her outside and down a long, rickety ramp. I hear a commotion and look back. The narrator is telling about how it's a very hot day and the animals, especially the big ones, are very irritable. An elephant goes crazy with the heat, which is bad news for the little trainer man. I muse that maybe I should, in my retirement, take on the part-time job of coordinating the disability resources because the different resources offices are in different places and are not run smoothly. I'm mildly interested. Now I hold a big, cream-colored, furry cat and let go of it and expect it to land on its feet and walk away, but the cat is lazy or something and lands painfully on its belly. I drop it again and it does the same thing. I grimace with sympathetic pain and consider the cat rather slow-brained. I go outside and see Howard getting into a box, which is a sort of car. I wait for his wife to get in next. I don't want to get in too early and be alone with him. I put the cat in and wait impatiently for the wife, who comes out arrogant and snotty. (233 words)

I am visiting a house owned by a nice-looking man. His current girlfriend is moving out and he is now interested in me. I take a tour of the house, which has magnificent views all around of mountains and so on. The house is set up to give you a roller coaster ride effect as you walk around. I enjoy the thrill of walking across a wooden bridge between two rooms as it tosses and jiggles like in an earthquake. Now I am washing dishes in the kitchen sink and he's drying them. He is playfully flirting and there is pleasant sexual tension between us. Rena sits next to us and I ask, "What does she do?" He says, "She sits there and looks pretty." I think that is a bit condescending and feel bad for Rena. But I ignore it and continue talking with him. Now he's a very rich man and I am taking him a note I wrote with a joke on it. I am leaving him, sort of to prove I'm not after his wealth and I am my own woman, independent and so on. He reads my card, which says something about "May the Buddha follow you," or something like that. He looks at it and I giggle at him saying, "You don't get it, do you? You don't know what the Buddha is." I take the card to a man in the next room to share this great joke with him. I think his name is Howard. I say, laughing, "And he doesn't even know what the Buddha is!" (265 words)

I am prospecting for gold in a desert-like area. Lots of men are there. One man, like Christopher Reeves, is in love with me. I love him too. He wants us to get married. I love him, but am not willing to marry. I want my independence. We strike it rich. I say to him, "I have something I have to talk to you about." He says, frustrated, "I can't talk about it any more. I say, "It's not about that! This is something else you probably won't like to hear." I smile at him gently like it's a joke, only it's not. Now he is seated in an easy chair and I am kneeling in front of him, my head on his chest, my arms around his chest between his legs, hugging him. He is aroused and says sexily and lovingly, "You're on my heaven. Let's get married." I say, sleepily or slowly, "How about you stay here and work the claim for a year while I go away, and travel, and then I'll return and you travel for a year and I'll work the claim." He is deeply hurt and sad because that would mean we are apart. I feel a bit guilty about asking this. The scene shifts and I have chosen to run away. I go out into the desert and want to die. I lay down with dead beetles and a video camera and am going to wait until I dehydrate, but somehow I survive for years. Now a woman comes and says to me, "I know you want to die, I'm sorry to bother you, but...." and I say, "No, I've decided not to die. Help me." She helps me back home to the claim. I am exhausted, dehydrated and older. I come into the house, which used to be a cabin he and I shared. Now there are children and babies of his, sleeping in beds, and lots of furniture. I am sad, but I am happy for him. He comes to me hesitantly. He still loves me deeply. I know I hurt him badly. I say, "I do love you. I'm sorry I hurt you. Is it too late?" He hugs me and I know we will be together. (377 words)

I live in an apartment which I apparently share with roomies. I am unhappy. Something has happened or I am wondering deeply what I should be doing with my life. I choose not to go to work or school or wherever I usually go on weekdays. I decide I need to drive to Dover, which means go visit Ginny. Bonnie comes in. I think maybe I'll go across the street and visit Derek, later. Bonnie and I go look for the kitchen. There are two complete kitchens next to each other. The back one is mine. I say to her, "See, even if the roomies want to be cooking at the same time as us, we have our own kitchen." Bonnie likes that. I tell her I'm going to Dover. She leaves. For some reason I am hesitating and not leaving. I don't really want to go to Dover or to visit Derek and I do want to all at the same time. Now the house is crowded with roomies in the living room and I wonder where I can go to be alone. I find a back bedroom and go in. At first it is small and has a couch or two, not very pleasant. I then see there is more to it and follow it back to a comfortable sitting room with burgundy flounce curtains and a stereo speaker system that makes the music sound grand. I sit; it is nice. Then I decide to go see Derek. Maybe it will help. But I also don't want to go. Mateo goes with me. We drive to his corner and We get out and I realize there is a window display I'd never seen before, bottles with colored water in them. I see now I'm not at Derek's house; I'm a block too soon, on 14th and Ferry, not 15th and Ferry Street. I feel a bit silly to have made this mistake. We go back to get in the truck (pickup or VW bus) to drive to his house. (341 words)

I am startled and pleased, but don't know quite what to do or think, because it was so clear this wasn't going to be a part of our relationship. I can't quite believe it all. I wait, hugging him slightly to see if this continues or if it was just a "stray" kiss. He continues, obviously now indicating we will be lovers. (94 words)

My mother is indifferent and insists I leave the house, even though I am in emotional shock from some event. I see a couple standing in a cold lake up to their chest. They are uncomfortable. I see another couple, fully dressed standing in a very hot lake. They are enjoying the hot tub-like feeling but XXX a picture book which requires the page to be placed in a machine so it projects the story like a movie. The lace curtains and the black velvet drapes keep getting in the way. The wind is blowing them toward the area I'm working. A man tries to help me. He's sort of a Michael Bolton fellow, but very shy. I tuck several of the lace curtains outside the open window and the strong wind sucks them out and I see them land on the lawn. We are on the second story floor. I see the wind blow one across the lawn. I call out, "Oh, the curtains." The man goes down to retrieve them for me. As we are going down, he is very shy and nervous because as a shy man he's afraid to approach women, to date, so he's going to practice approaching the little girl. I say to him, "You have your best friend with you (some other man) and I am a very good friend. You'll be all right." I feel a bit jealous because I am the mother of the girl and I want the man to like me. (252 words)

I had been reading or watching a long story about this pioneer man and how he was so upset about the bad treatment of Indians. He wants to go out and fist fight every one who is calling him squaw man. But a woman says, "Don't waste your energy. Ignore them." Now I am a woman and I walk up to a seated Indian man, who is wearing an 1890's kind of black jacket, like Wyatt Earp would have worn, white man's clothes. He's the foreman. He calls out the black woman I will have as a slave. He hands me the white, little plastic bag which has her documents in it. It's her "freedom" bag. I take it and hand it to her. I say, "Elizabeth. I give you your freedom." She doesn't understand. She thinks I'm firing her and she'll be alone and poor. I say to her, "You are your own woman now and I'd like to hire you. I will pay $6 a week." The Indian man shows me a picture. It has a bright spotlight in the center and a sidelight where he's standing. He says, "I'm in the side light because I'm an Indian. I've always wanted to be in the center spotlight." I say to him, "I understand. Believe it or not, I am in the sidelight too, because I'm a woman with a disability. We get the same kind of discrimination." [BL] (239 words)

I get a phone call from a man trying to sell me a modem for my computer. The connection is very bad. I can barely hear him. The phone I hold has a round ring of lights that light up when it rings. A woman's voice says: "Your phone is ringing. Please press 4." I may not have pressed the right button or something but the guy's voice keeps cutting out. He's a rude and insistent man. I say to him firmly, "I'm not interested" as well as a confused message that I can't hear him well or the connection is bad. He says, "Shit," and tries to keep me on the line. I hang up on him, saying to my woman roommate, "Boy, he sure isn't good at this." She says, "Come out here and look at the flowers growing on the porch." I am annoyed. I'm very tired and sleepy and it's hard to walk, but she wants us to share some time together and the flowers are a way to do that.

A man with an odd face, like it has cake makeup or something on it, is intensely and single-mindedly attracted to me. I try to get away from him politely. He follows. He is a son of a king or a millionaire, but he acts goofy like an idiot. I am embarrassed by him and I'm also feeling sort of warm and attracted because of his vulnerability. He is so out there with his love for me. He pursues; I dodge; he persists. Later, there's a statement or question, "How is it like to be a gangster?" "They both have leading hose and bands." He also has a father who is just like him who is attracted to an older woman, perhaps my mother. He intensely woos her. He also tells his son that it may be too late. He (the son) may have failed his mission, which was to convince a general to give him armies and so on so they could defend their kingdom. I want to help him as he's almost got the general convinced. We could still do it. (183 words)

I am working for MIUSA. We are at a camp someplace. A woman with CP wants to show me something. We walk up a long rickety flight of stairs at the back of a building, go in, and walk down another flight, go across the building and out the door. She trips several times, nearly falling. She is very happy because she's been given permission to adopt a young disabled girl. She's taking me to see her. I haven't a clue why we had to go through that empty barn first. Now I'm leaving. The camp trip is over and I get a gift box sent in the mail. I open it. It's from the crew at the Forest Department. I had stayed at their office building and they so enjoyed my charming personality they wanted to give me a gift. I am very touched. It's a large logging truck, but no logs, just little cubicles to put cute little miniature knickknacks in. It is filled with little things. Behind it is a knickknack holder in the shape of a doll house and had oodles of miniature furniture and things in it. I'm very pleased. Now someone comes in with bad news to tell me. Charla comes in and sits on my lap. She is very sad. I ask her what happened. She says, "Henry the 16th has died." I at first don't remember who that is. Then I remember it is my daughter Ellie's good friend that Charla loved so much she named her kitten after her. I rock Charla, being soothing and also thinking, "Well, I thought the bad news was going to be bigger than that, maybe a national tragedy." I am a bit let down. Some other counselor comes up to say goodbye and we talk about the young woman with CP. I say, "It's so amazing. Here she can barely walk across the room without hurting herself and yet she has just the right loving skills to help her adopted child. It's a beautiful contradiction. (340 words)

Derek and I are returned from someplace. He has taken me home and he comes over to hug me and slowly the hug evolves into us making love, only it never is acknowledged we are making love. He lies on me with his back to me and sneaks his penis into me backwards. It is not hard, but the catheter tube helps it feel hard and it is a good sexual feeling. I lightly touch him on his bare shoulders and sometimes sneak a kiss on his neck or shoulder. Charla is nearby. I don't want her to see us and know we are making love. It is not appropriate and OK for her to know this/see this. Then he begins to move back and forth quickly and he has had an orgasm. That is very unusual for him, as he is a para. He sighs, relieved. I tenderly lie with him. I'm not sure if I had an orgasm or not. (162 words)

I have moved to another house and visit my old house, which now is lived in by Harriet. I see the Saturday newspaper on the porch and I say to her, "I'll take the paper." I pick it up and start to leave. I then realize that it is her paper. She pays for it. So I go back and give it to her, apologizing. I just wasn't thinking. Now I am going to my new place and I go through the college. I ask directions and the young woman says, "You go to the back of the building, take the elevator up to the 4th floor, and then return to the 3rd floor." It seemed an odd, out of the way to go and I only have three minutes to do it in. I start to run, but it is very difficult for me. I end up laying on the sidewalk, pulling myself along. I struggle. I know I won't make it. I'm not sure which path through the fair will get me there the quickest. Some paths meander or dead end. I find a sign and hear circus music and follow that. I get to the elevator area, but now there is a man I am in relationship with and he is playful and loving and wants to have fun and make love, and I laugh and say I have to do these things. I think I am picking up clothes and cleaning things. A little girl like Charla is around somewhere. It will be fun to get the work done and relax into the lovingness of my partner. I look forward to it. He is very desirous of me letting go of the work now and just having fun with him. There are tough guys like bikers somewhere in the background. They like me too. (308 words)

A man is talking to me. We are in a space where there is a double bed and an empty bookshelf, with old newspapers covering it up. I decide to go to bed and I crawl up the shelves and claw my way through the old newspapers to get to the shelf. I have a hard time, but finally get curled up on a shelf. It is uncomfortable. I cover myself with the newspapers, which look like the magazine pages for my collage art. The man is in the bed and he wants to get up and get something and apologizes to me for not being covered. I see his penis as he bends down to get something. He wants to know why I don't come to bed where it's more comfortable. I explain that Howard had been there so long that I'd gotten used to sleeping up on the shelf. It was better that way than be with Howard. I realize that I'd rather be in the bed even though this strange man is there and start to get off the shelf to go to bed. We'll just have to work out our relationship with each other after I get there. (202 words)

I am seated on a stone staircase in a huge palace. It is near the bottom stair. Derek and another woman are tickling and giggling over in a corner. I am smiling and feeling good about being who I am and not jealous or bothered by their play. Now I get up and walk back unexpectedly into my bedroom. I find Derek and the woman there making love in the bed, only I don't really see the woman, just Derek, fully clothed lying sideways on my single bed. I am furious and tell him off and spin on my heel to leave. He says, "No, please. Stay and talk with me." I laugh angrily and walk out. I want to walk off my anger by going as fast as I can up the staircase until I have gone as far and as high as I can go in this stone palace. I walk and walk until there is a huge stone wall or boulder stopping me. I peek in a crevasse or crack and can't see anything. Then there is an earthquake and everything around me falls until I am alone on a high, thin sliver of rock left from the palace. Then the scene shifts and the earthquake didn't happen and I am on the stairs and decide to retrace my steps down. A guard finds me and he's going to show me the way out, only now he takes me to the sultan's private quarters. I am impressed. I see women and one has a baby and she lets me hold it. While I am holding it, it relaxes and takes a nap. The sultan is near and I'm not sure if it's him or not, but bow and say, "Your highness," just in case. He and his wife are introduced to me. He kisses my hand and I see his fat, double-chinned face and his fat lips. He kisses me several times. He seems to like me. I go back to where the women are and return the sleeping baby and follow the guard out, only to find myself suddenly led into the harem and I realize I've been tricked. He intends to keep me forever.

I am in the back seat of a car. My brother Jake is with me. My father is driving. I am looking out the right side window (like a child might) and I see a dropoff. It's pretty, with snow, but a steep dropoff. I look to my father. I see we're on a gravel/dirt road. I tell him he's driving too close to the edge. It's dangerous. He laughs and deliberately jerks the wheel so we are even closer. I am annoyed. We drive through town. It does not look familiar, but yet it is my town. We are going to a nursing home to visit "Aunt Marya." When we get there, I realize we're at an ice rink. I say, "Hey, I thought we were going to a nursing home to see Aunt Marya." She walks by, a very old woman, and I feel embarrassed she heard me because she obviously doesn't need a nursing home. I've insulted her. Someone says, "Let's play ice hockey." "Right!" I say. "So is the ice rink wheelchair accessible?" I was sarcastic. Now I see Aunt Millie and Lydia. I am very excited and happy to see Aunt Millie. We all now have on ice skates. Aunt Millie is on my left and Lydia on my right, supporting me as I fumble and slip. We get on the ice, but the ice is really crowded with people and cafe tables and chairs. There are rectangular cuts of ice where the ice is chips and there is water under it. I must avoid all these obstacles. In addition, at the far right end is a heated swimming pool, and it's hard to avoid sliding right into it. But I manage and now I'm skating alone and Millie and Lydia are seated watching me as I come around. They smile and applaud. I feel quite accomplished now and gather up speed. More rectangular cuts are made and the ice is incredibly chopped up, and yet I continue to skate well. (336 words)

I am swimming across a milky glacier-like lake. My hands and arms are straight and powerful. I am impressed with how easily I am doing this without getting tired or scared. I notice my legs are not moving, so I try and use them too. It is a bit awkward. I get out on the other side. Ernie and Ginny are coming over. I notice I'd better be on my toes and do things right if Ernie is around. I mail a letter. Later, he has a letter to be mailed, but it doesn't have a stamp on it. I help Ginny get a stamp on it.

I want to change my clothes, so I go down a series of flights of stairs to a room where I had stored some clothes. I walk in to see a couple on the floor almost starting to make love. They stop abruptly at my entrance. I smile and say, "Just a moment. Sorry. I need to get some clothes." They smile and say, "No problem," but of course I know they can't wait for me to leave so they can get on with it. I open drawer after drawer and can only find summery clothes from Mexico, gauzy material, bright colors, a bit revealing and sexy. I am aware I am too fat to wear them. I check the next chest of drawers and find them full of papers and Kodak film boxes, nothing to wear. Oh well. Now it is time to leave, and at the last minute I decide to clean up some mess I've left -- paper scraps, some tiny knitted or crocheted stocking hats, tiny yarn doll bodies and so on. Now I leave the room, thinking I should probably take the one chest of drawers that is mine and its contents back up to where I was. I feel tired and decide not to. I don't need that stuff anyway. The couple is very glad I'm leaving, but pretending to be polite. I say as I walk out the door, "I'm not stupid, you know." They grin. (I think there were mentally retarded people upstairs I was working with.) (255 words)

I have a personal assistant named Mary who is mentally retarded, short and chubby. She keeps talking all the time and doing things wrong, like holding the shampoo bottle upside down and not noticing the shampoo is running out all over her clothes. I ask her to help me take a bath. I am in the tub in my clothes, she has gotten my wallet wet and is trying to fix it and she is nonstop talking. I finally say to her, "Damn it, Mary, you're fired. I know you mean well and you're a hard worker, but you keep making mistakes." She gets in the tub with me and is trying hard to convince me not to fire her. I insist she get out. Finally I call Nancy in, who is visiting. She and Charlene are out in the living room talking. I explain to Nancy why I'm firing Mary and ask her to get her out of my tub. Nancy says, "OK," gets her out and then says, "I'm not the one to be telling this to." I agree, saying, "Sorry, I guess I was just ventilating." I wonder if this was such great timing, firing her when I was in the tub, a vulnerable spot for me. I also feel a bit concerned because now I have to find someone else. Maybe Charlene will work for me again. I think, "After all, she's been volunteering here for a while, so maybe she's got time again and wouldn't mind making $6 an hour." She is telling Nancy she just got one of her plays produced. (267 words)

I am being forced to marry a man by some irresistible force, possibly alien or spiritual. I try to escape. I do not want to be married. I don't even know the man. I get in an elevator and it starts to go sideways across University campus to the site of the wedding. I try to stay in the elevator but I am forced out, by some force I cannot see. There is no escape. I am now in a wedding dress, the wedding party is there and it is happening even as I fight it. I feel powerless. I don't want traditional marriage. It sets women back generations. (109 words)

I am at some shop and notice a house next door. Many Asian and colored people are going in, many of them very distinctively dressed in costumes that are highly colorful, quilted or poofy and ornate. It's a church of some kind. I go over and lean on the fence in front of the house to watch. Now members of the church are tossing some of the people out over the balcony, some of them dropping or falling three stories. I am concerned that they will be hurt with broken bones, but they are not. These members are being ritually thrown out or rejected. Now Dora joins me. I want to take pictures, but I am out of film. I take an iron and smooth out a rectangle of sawdust, the medium used to take pictures with, even though I know it won't do any good. Now Dwight comes up and says, "Come on, we're all going now to pick out a present I'll buy for each of you." I say, "Great, but not right now, because I want to see this." He leaves. I continue watching. A few minutes later, Dora and I go to find Dwight. Maybe it's too late to get our gift. Dora shows me an ornate decorated cake she made for the contest. It has sort of a blue ribbon design on it. I say, "It's very pretty." I don't find Dwight. (237 words)

I am talking to a man about how crazy making it is to work in crowded conditions. I tell him about registration at the community college and how each year it got more crowded. I see Tyler telling Charlene one of his stories and smile because I know she has heard it many times. I wonder if she will just stoically listen or what. She finally interrupts him and says she has heard it before. She leaves and he smiles sheepishly. Now the man comes into my bedroom. I think I am rooming in his house. His son is upstairs. He is a quad and the man is crying as he tells me that today the assistant can't come today and he will have to be left alone. I offer to call in sick at work and stay to help him, but it would mean moving him downstairs and I couldn't transfer him. The man is grateful. [BL] (157 words)

I am the head resident of a sorority and we are having a party. I am dressed up in a lovely long skirt and blouse. I walk up the flowing stairs and around watching. Now the men are arriving. Someone says, "Oh, oh. It isn't good to just open the dance to any man off the street." I see quite a crowd of them streaming in. They are rowdy and I am more busy being vigilant. I go to my quarters and get the key to the front door from my purse and hide my purse and then put the key in my pocket. Now Anddrea comes in and a shy young man named Ted. Andrea begins to work with him as a counselor. There is an audience of students watching. He is shy and we both encourage him to tell his dream. Andrea lays down next to him talking in soothing accents. He begins to tell the dream and then interrupts himself and says, "Oh, I get it. The answer is money. I need to make lots of money with my writing." Some man smiles and gently shakes his head no. (192 words)

I am going back to school to take a class. I can't seem to find the class I want to take. I wander around the buildings. Now I am in a class, a sort of business class. Another student, a woman, and I are a team. She is to place a box on the floor in the exact position as in the book. I notice that no matter where we place it, it's not quite right on the bottom side. I try adjusting my position to see if it makes a difference. Someone says I have excellent spatial perception. I am surprised because I don't, usually. I decide this is a boring class and wander around noticing other classes. I pass the animal biology classes and don't like them. I find myself in the film media classes, big classes lots of students, cute instructors. I am interested. I decide I'll get into one of those. Now I want to go home, but I can't find an exit door that works. Two men students follow me upstairs and try to open conversation. I ask them how to get out. They take me back downstairs, which is hard in my manual wheelchair. They are impressed with me and say they have a room I could rent in their boarding house. I say, "I've already got one, thanks." I finally get out and head home. A piano tuner is tuning the old square like piano I had found in the basement for me and it has been moved up to the living room. The landlady gives me and my male friend a lecture about being always late for meals and we will get cold meals if we keep this up. I look outside and see my small brother, maybe 5 years old, wandering away toward the big lake. I am concerned and run after him to retrieve him. I see him get into a rowboat with several other boys and head out for deep water. I tell my younger sister she must go back and tell my father and get help. She cries that she is afraid she will lose her way and not know the turns. I grab her by the shoulders and say with confidence, "You are a smart girl. You will know the right way." She goes. I run across the rice paddy-like area, then over the beach sand and then into the water. Just then I see the small plastic rowboat and yank my brother out of it after some confusion about which one was my brother. I give him what for, lecturing him at how surprised I was that he would not heed our dead mother's words about always being honest. Other people come to retrieve their little boys and I learn they had been going around begging for money and collecting some. I am handed some plastic spoons as his share of the take. I want to return it to the rightful owners, but have no way to do so so. I walk my brother back toward home, continuing to say I am so surprised at him. He cries and I hug him saying, "But now you learned a lesson and won't do it again. (538 words)

A woman is dating the principal of a school. He is coordinating or producing some kind of talent show. She is sort of cool or taking him for granted. Another woman comes in, short, tightly curled black hair, very sexy in a silky, black, short dress. He is very attracted to her and the first woman gets a bit jealous. The sexy woman looks down and notices her breasts are exposed. She pulls the black jacket, a man's jacket, up around her to cover herself. She still looks sexy. She's interested in the man, and wanders around his school room looking at things on the desk and walls, so she can get a feeling for who he is. There are lots of pictures he drew that make her think he's an architect because all the forms are separated out like on a schematic. Later, I see some of the talent acts doing their thing, but the school desk is in the way of the camera and he has to decide to do it again or not. He wants it to be a good job, so he begins again. Now I am a woman and I notice he has given to the first woman some gifts in a plastic bag. One of the gifts is a small diary with the name Barb Sanders written on the cover. I wonder if he gave her my book which I gave him. That doesn't feel good. I leaf through it, feeling guilty I'm spying. Then I see many black velvet wrist watches all over my left arm. I suddenly realize that back in 1986 when I traveled to Russia with MIUSA that everyone wanted to not wear their watches because in the late afternoon it was hot and humid, so I agreed to hold them for them, and I accidentally didn't get them returned. I feel bad, but it's too late now. The first woman tries on a couple of them she likes. (329 words)

Two men and I are traveling to T City to visit Dora again. I had visited lately and it was very enjoyable. The one man is sort of Derek but is sort of Kyle, but I call him Dwight, although it seems to me his name may be something else. The other man is his younger brother and is pretty much Kyle's younger brother, the one that molested Charla. I ask what vehicle we are in and he says it's their Dad's vacation camper. It is a square box-like thing with tiny kitchen appliances. I try to explain how to get to Dora's new place, called Paradise Cove, but I can't remember, so I am trying to read the maps. I can't seem to find T City on the map and I try repeatedly. Now the younger brother says, "I'm exhausted from driving; it has cramped me up," and I look at the other brother who says, "I can't, I'm too tired." I say, "Maybe I can, is it power steering and brakes?" "Yes." I try to steer, but it is a small crank handle and isn't very responsive. We are getting nowhere fast. (194 words)

Theresa/Cherokee is driving a pickup and I am the passenger. I see us driving very fast across the canyon to get to the event. We overslept. I see her dark hair very clearly; she is vibrant and pretty. I see my gray hair. Now I arrive with my little girl. We'd been in such a rush we hadn't taken time to eat breakfast or take my pills. I walk, holding the girl in my arms. I find my yellow pill box and take the pills, only the vitamin, the calcium, and the hormones. I put them aside, sort of checking if I had enough to make it through the stay. Now I see the group, singing is over and someone already moved the pickup. I am looking for some breakfast. I choose the left hall and open a door to see a smoke-filled room with an annoyed woman in it. I apologize because I hadn't realized this was now someone's private living quarters. I now go down the hall on the right. I see an Indian woman who gives me $1.10 in tokens as I can't find my purse. I assure her I'll pay her back. She says, "Go to the farmer's wife. She still has breakfast." I say, "Is this enough money?" She smiles at my concern. I find the farmer's wife and am asking the girl what she would like to eat. The girl isn't particularly interested in any of my suggestions. (244 words)

Darcy is trying to sneak into my father's car to use it to go somewhere. My father and I are nearby and ask her what she thinks she's doing, like we caught her red-handed. She explains she wants to go and talk to a girl who was sexually abused and explain to her that it's OK to tell people. She didn't know that when it happened to her and wants to encourage the girl. I feel bad I was so negative and suspicious of her and say shyly, "I wish you would talk about it more to me. I'd like to know more." She is friendly, but somehow avoids telling me anything. Now I want to go see an old wooden sidewalk I used to walk as a child. I find it and walk it to the end and admire the wooden panels folded up at the end. The wood is beautiful. Now a bunch of people are there and I am telling the man operator of the sidewalk my story of how we'd come here to meet my father and then go swim (my brother and me) off the end of the sidewalk. This was somewhere near N City. It was a happy, nostalgic memory and the people are all gladdened to hear it. They want to videotape the cute story for publicity. I let them. Later I'm asking my mother what my father wants for his birthday present. She shows me pies and cakes and finally some chocolate fudge. I choose the fudge, it's easier to take along. Darcy gives him a cute child's video with mermaids on the cover. I had given him one entitled "Bambi's King" or something like that. It had a sweet cover of lots of little girl mermaids seated around. He is very happy and I ask him, "Why the mermaids?" He says the photo reminds him of a group of women campers and he wants to use the photo to create some photo story of a past happy event. (337 words)

I am a beautiful young woman like Audrey Hepburn, in a basic black dress, black heels and all the men watch me as I walk with grace and elegant beauty. Women are in a line and going down a steep cement stairway, no sides or rails. We then step into the water, which is thigh deep. We each come to a small water faucet like fountain and bend and take a drink. It is some ritual. As it is my turn, I see an old woman sneak in and take my turn. I graciously let her, even holding down the push button to let the water flow. Then I bend to take my drink. The woman whose turn would be next shoves me away saying, "I gave up my turn when I let the old woman drink." I disagree and try to take my drink. She keeps shoving me, so I turn and fight her, socking her in the face and knocking her down. The watching men really like and admire my feisty attitude. But the woman, her name is Betty, hates me now and keeps relentlessly coming after me. I fight her again and escape to my small black convertible sports car. She chases me through the city streets. Finally I outfox her by turning into a very narrow alley between two huge stone houses. It is a steep incline. Betty is driving a big car so she doesn't fit. Now she has friends and is walking down toward me. I tap on the small ancient glass windows, but no one responds. I pick up my black cellular phone and call 911. Sympathetic cops ask where I am and I try to describe it, then I drive away and Betty still pursues. My roads are disappearing; then I have to drive up a dirt hill, and then a sand-filled, half paved road where construction is going on. I can't seem to find a main road to get back to the city. Lots of water is pouring down on one sandy road like they are constructing stuff. (347 words)

I am in an airplane going home and am traveling with a disabled man. We somehow find or went to look at property that could be a nice place for him to live and an OK investment. Somehow the plane returns and we get off and agree and sign papers to buy this property, and now we are flying home. A man like Loren C. comes out of a room, sleepy like he just woke up and he is shivering. He greets a tall, sharp-faced man who looks like John, my therapist. He calls him "Omni" as in Omnipotent, the leader, a joke. Loren says he didn't realize the cabin they bought was so primitive and cold. He is unhappy with recent purchase. I am startled to realize I bought some property also. It is so isolated and out in the eastern Washington high desert. What was I thinking? "John" sits next to me and says, "Can you love me?" He is in love with me. I smile and say, "I like you." He has his shirt off and puts his arm around me. We kiss and then he says, "I see, you don't love me." The kiss was very uninteresting and neutral. He will wait, hoping. We arrive back. I am looking at a bunch of map- like papers he gave me. I decide I will visit him, since on the paper is a sort of puzzle where when you read the words he asks me to visit his home. But I can't figure out where it is, somewhere in Washington. Later, Loren won't talk to me as he's mad because he doesn't like the property. I am about to leave and he calls me over to smile and say it's not your fault I had different expectations. I thank him for telling me that. I feel relieved of my guilt. The scene shifts and I've built a beautiful home on the property, which has a river on it. My bedroom is partly submerged in the river, built with Plexiglas corner so I can see the river life underneath. I wake up, afraid for a moment because some huge-eyed thing is staring at me through the glass. After my fright, I appreciate the beauty of this view. John is in the other room and somehow I know we are a mere ten miles from a big city, even though I am out there in the boondocks. (407 words)

Now another good-looking cowboy comes up my back stairs. He is Rod Taylor. He stops to flirt and chat. He talks about his pain and I tell him I have RA.

Ellie is going to do a strip tease in a contest. She's the first one up. She is 200 lbs. and confident. She gets up on the platform, which is a rickety series of platforms. She begins. I call to Ginny, who is in the other room trying to phone her husband. I save her a seat. There are lots of college kids on bleachers, then my wheelchair and one armchair. I stand up in the armchair and Ginny sits in the wheelchair. I feel a bit embarrassed for Ellie because she's so fat and so enthusiastically naive. But she's doing OK. The crowd is very quiet and nonresponsive. In the middle of her strip, her platforms shift and she falls between two of them with one leg. It throws her off a bit, but she comes back, very plucky, to try again, I can see the platforms are very precarious. She tries again and quickly slips again. This time she lands on the floor on her back, breaking a small drawer. She lays there, annoyed.The crowd is curiously noncaring. I call out, "Are you all right?" She says, "Yeah, but it's over." The next fat woman comes out. I notice she is pretty, as was Ellie, even though very fat. (211 words)

I would like to do sex, but as soon as he's in the picture, everything shuts down in disgust. Later I pass a medical test which proves I have quick and normal arousal responses, but it's quickly interrupted by a shut down because of Howard. The test also confirms I am heterosexual, very heterosexual. Later, I am visiting Ginny and trying to take my pills and have breakfast. I'm having a hard time. (97 words)

I see a child, possibly Charla, going to school and realize a man with a gun is there in the crowd to harm the children. I am outraged and run through the crowd and hit him from behind, knocking him down and taking his shotgun. He gets up and runs, then turns and has a bazooka. He aims at me as I aim at him. We fire at the same time. I see the blue ball of fire and duck, so it only grazes my side. He is hit, but does not fall. We fire again and again. He walks toward me until I fire point blank into his belly. He finally dies. I am rewarded by being given the powers of a fairy. I am full-sized and me, but now I have cute wings and sparkle dust. I can fly and turn invisible. So I decide to get rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world. I decide to remove the nuclear waste buried in Washington on the reservation. I fly there, go invisible and cause all those barrels of radioactive material out billions of miles into outer space, being sure that it isn't on a path that will eventually drift into a planet and cause harm. I then must retreat as the men are looking for me. I try to fly away and realize this was a huge job and I am exhausted, my powers temporarily depleted. I can't turn invisible so I hide and wait for my powers to return, so I can take on the next nuclear task. (263 words)

I am a young Eleanor Roosevelt, my waist is slimming down, my pairs of thick glasses are the buttons I close my waist band with. My new husband notices I am looking more pretty and desirable. I go to take a bath and realize I have no privacy now, as it is the White House. The door to the bathroom is open and people could walk through. I realize I am naive and have much I should lean, so I don't accidentally embarrass the presidency. I try to gather up my pills that fell into the bathtub. Now I am picking up my things and see that a box of children's books aren't mine. Oliver North/Jerome sits behind me. He is called Colneral. He is dishonest and feels bad about it. (131 words)

I think I had been ill and am recovering. I want Charla to go to the Publications Dept. again and get me some copies of pictures of specific notables like Deepak Chopra and Dr. Spock and so on. I decide at the last moment to go with her. I'd just gotten my hair cut and it is brown and the bangs are curly. So I follow her out to the hall and we get the elevator. We get in and Charla, the little girl in the TV movie last night, who is precocious and has temper tantrums. She sees a backpack on the floor and says its her mommy's. Then she orders a few things off the back wall shelves. The attendant gets them for her; it's like a store. She had earned a few dimes during my illness running errands. The elevator goes up for a long time and then it goes straight like a car on an old road. The attendant says the department is now in the Brown Building downtown. I am quite surprised and think this is a good way to get a free ride downtown when I want to run errands. I'll just pretend I'm going to the Publications Dept. We get to a hallway. On the left wall are signs. The first one says "October Games Free Software Month." The next one says "Las Prunes Month." We get to the department and we go in. I say to a woman clerk, "I'd like Xerox copies of some pictures..." and she interrupts, "Now there's the problem. You have to pay for those copies and the person you pay is not here. He is on duty..." and she lists three times. I suggest we try and locate the pictures and then later I'd come back and make copies. I am annoyed. Earlier I was a bit amazed at how far the ride had been and a bit chagrined I'd sent the little girl there for errands so often. (332 words)

Richard R is inviting me to a snazzy party and is giving me directions to get there. It's not far away, but the directions seem complicated: four right turns in a row. I say, "But that depends on where the right turns start. I notice M. Street is right outside my door. I am wearing a blouse and no bra and the nipple of one breast peeks out. I try to cover it up. Now he decides to show me how to get there and we go out. I would go straight on M. Street but he points out ugly construction. That is terrible to go through construction, so he says, "We'll take this turn and take the shortcut." We are on a gravel road and I realize we'd made a turn and I didn't note the name of the corner or a landmark. How will I find my way again? But we are there now, and lots of round tables are set up with place settings and name tags and little gifts for each person. He says, "Remember, your place is _______," something that starts with a C. I wander around the crowded area looking for my spot. I finally find it way in the back, where it's the hardest to get to. I smile at the irony. Of course it would be so. But I have several books there waiting for me, special gifts. A woman is jealous. Now I am home and a young woman named Theresa and Richard R (now a woman) have a heavy discussion. Richard is the woman's daughter that gave the party. The mother is gravely ill. Theresa was adopted when she was in the 7th grade and the mother and she really talk and understand each other well. It is a good loving relationship and Richard is jealous, as he is the real blood daughter, but it isn't as deep or loving for him. Now a man named Larry (like Raul) comes in all intense and jovial and charming. I like him and want him to stay. He sees Theresa (now called Amy) and the mother at my house and sighs. He'd rather avoid them because it is such an emotional drain on him as he takes the clown caring role to cheer them up. He goes in to do that, as their brother is ill with AIDS and they are worried about him. I say to Larry as he comes out, "Where are you going?" He says, "Off to a summer vacation spot to have fun." I tell him I feel sadness for him as I wonder whose shoulder he cries on. Who takes care of him? He keeps me at a emotional distance and rushes away quickly. (457 words)

I, the dreamer, is watching a scene. I seem to identify with the married man. A woman and a man get married after a short, but loving, courtship. Soon after they are married, they begin to have misunderstandings and fights. They are always angry at each other and can't seem to reconcile it. They are miserable, yet they love each other. There is another man, an architect, who loves the woman and she goes to visit him. The jealous husband, who has another kind of career, follows her and comes into the house. The two men talk. The husband is angry and belligerent, but after a while the other man begins to understand that the husband is a good man, but hurt. So he helps the husband understand, and brings the woman and the husband back together, even though he still loves her. But now he is best friends with the husband and cares as much for him. The husband and the woman go out to the car to drive home when the woman's parents come to get in the back seat. They are argumentative and negative at the husband, who in his new-found understanding, doesn't tolerate it anymore. He tells them to shut up. The woman at first is upset and then understands that is right. She smiles at the husband. [BL] (222 words)

I am in a class, maybe writing class. A woman is setting up some sort of conference. She is taking special interest in making me comfortable. She gives me a notebook and papers and a candle and a potted plant and other amenities. I gather them up one by one with Charla's help and take them to my desk, but it takes up two desks worth of room. I'm the only one this is permitted with. Now it's time to go to the first activity. I get on a sailboat she is trying to drive. At first it won't budge from the dock, but then as she turns the wheel around and around. It starts to go, but the channel is very obstructed with things like wooden boxes and so on. We bump our way through them, she turning the wheel sharply from one end to the other. It fairly spun in her hands. We get off and walk down a path to a house. Inside the ceremonies are beginning. Each person has special duties or tasks to do. One man is reading a religious paper. Someone asks me, Where's my copy?" I say, "Oh, I left it on my desk. I already read it." Then I feel like I would like to join in with the man, reciting passages with him, but don't have my copy. Then a man in a wheelchair dressed in drag comes in. His mother tells him to go on back out and continue with the activity. He takes his black, curly wig off. He is partially bald. He feels a little silly dressed in women's clothes. (272 words)

A married couple are fighting. The man is cold and selfish. The woman may be Asian. I see a baby, their baby, fall off a high dock into an ocean. I am afraid for the baby. The mother sees it too and dives quickly off the dock into the waters. His granny did too, but she's more hindrance than help. I feel dread and fear as I hope I don't have to witness the drowning of this baby, and there is not a thing I can do to help. I watch as the mother strongly swims over to him and saves him, then let's him float underwater, teaching him to swim, so if this happens again, he will be safe. I am anxious and want her to bring the baby up to safe, dry land right now, but I realize her strategy is best. (144 words)

A rather stupid, lanky man is asking me questions. I hold a package with a small plastic bag of white beads in it. It is a beading kit. He asks me what the words on the package says. I say, "Stretched string beads." He asks how many beads there are. Are there enough to bead a whole shirt? I answer gruffly, "How would I know? It doesn't say." I am annoyed with his attitude and questions. The man says, "Why don't you lighten up?" I realize I am being sharp and grumpy, but I say, "Because I don't want to," which is true. This IS the way I feel and I don't want to change it right now. [BL] (118 words)

I am in the M City house, sleeping in my bedroom. I open my eyes and see my "dad" walking up to my open bedroom door. He is tall and lanky like Nate. He is so tall, his head is above the doorjamb. I feel fear. He is going to harass me. He then walks down the stairs to go to the bathroom. I sneak out of my room and run into my brother's room (actually the room my parents had). I crawl under the covers with one of my brothers trying to hurriedly pull up the covers over me. He's coming back up the stairs and I know a part of my shoulder may be visible. I know this won't work and I'll probably got my brothers in trouble too, but I stay there. He comes in and looks around. I think he sees me, but lets me be. He leaves. I go quickly back into my bedroom to the closet to try and change clothes before he comes back. As I pull a dress off a hanger, I am standing in the closet, which seems to have lots of room. A weird-looking girl comes and watches me. I tell her to go away. I pull on my dress, which I wonder if it is too fancy and will call attention to myself. I go downstairs to the kitchen where my mother is fixing French toast for breakfast. She wants me to do something and is grumpy. [BL] (248 words)

I am in a world where everyone else are aliens in human bodies like in the Body Snatchers. I can trust no one. Everyone else is emotionless and ready to get me. I run, driving my car. This goes on for a long time. Now I am staying at some man's house. I am sad and stoic, alone and getting on with it. My old lover comes by. I am in the back seat of a car. I think my mother is there too. The man is in the passenger side of the front seat. He is tall and lanky like Nate and like "Albert" of the movie, "Legends of the Fall" which I saw last night. He is sad and loving. He wants me back. I find it hard to resist, but I must. This is sweet and exquisite torture, to want to melt into his arms and yet feel compelled not to. He is looking around the car and trying to make small talk to keep me there, counting the number of paper cups there and so on. I smile saying, "There used to be more, before I cleaned up the car." He says, "Let me help you on with your coat." He does, and I let him. It is a poignant and slow motion move where he puts my arms into the coat like you would a child, and as I sit there with my arms out, letting him, my body and arms are in a gesture of opening up to embrace him. I feel great sadness and a desire to throw my arms around him, but I stoically hold still and let this moment pass. I get out of the car and walk back to the house. My "mother," a dark-haired woman is there standing on the sidewalk, being somehow derisive and putting me down. I walk past her. As I step up on the first step of the porch, I realize there is mud on my shoes, which are soled moccasins. I try to rub them on the indoor/outdoor carpet mat. My roommate, sort of a Bill R guy, comes out. I show him I am being a "good girl" and cleaning my feet off before coming in. He loves me too and smiles. The same feeling of sadness and stoic denial that love is impossible for me is there. As I scrape the mud off, I also accidentally scrape off the soles. He bends down gently to see the damage. He holds my foot and I see it is a small baby's foot in a silly sock, like the black one I have with red lip prints or kiss prints on it. He says he will get me some new shoes. I feel grateful, touched by his love for me. I fight to remain stoic and walk into the house. (476 words)

I interview for a job as a secretary for this college professor who has a terrible reputation as a womanizer who "feeds" on the young college girls. I am a sophisticated, together woman in white high heels and a business suit. I am also beautiful and tailored. I step through a room that might have been an old gym room in PE filled with a jumble of boxes and crates. I get to his office, which is also crowded with furniture and so on. My desk area is in the far back of the room, to the left as I walk in the door and all his stuff is to the right of the door. But the door opens to the side of the room, so as I sit at my desk and see him at his, facing me at the other end of the room, the door is on my right. He says to me in a jeering tone that he has his ways and if I can't handle being around it, then I need to leave. I smile and say calmly, "No problem." He hires me, now very curious about my calm and content demeanor. I do not disapprove of him or put him down, even though I don't believe what he is doing is right, but it is his life and I make no thought or attempt to try and change him. He feels that and is intrigued. I come to work the next day and clean my desk area. It is spotless, organized and ready for work in strong contrast to his area of cluttered furniture and so on. I sit, ready to work. He now wants to reform his ways and is falling in love with me and must earn my respect. I see two ugly rugs on his floor. He says, "I want new rugs. Go buy me some." I laugh and say, "Sure. What colors do you like?" He says patterns or designs. I write this down with a marker pen on an old rug piece tacked to the wall. He loves this because it is so unconventional. He says, "Maybe dandelions." I say, "Cute and fuzzy, or botanical?" He loves the way I banter matter-of- factly with him, not arguing or persuading him to anything I might prefer. I then go walking out to find the store. I come to the "main street" of the university area. A slick brick pattern is in the raised center of the road. I start to haul myself over the four-foot high raised area, throwing one leg over and scrambling, then I think, "This isn't going to work," and walk an extra block out of my way to the stairs over it. I go into the store. It is a huge area with many cubicles or desks where beautiful merchandise sits. People go sit at the desk/cubicle and admire different pieces as they decide to buy or not, lots of people. I see some exquisite glass vases and realize this is an auction or estate sale of very expensive material. I go to the back of the room to ask a clerk where are the carpets. He points off to a central area where I see bits of color. I then am distracted by other fine things to see. I decide I'll go see the carpets later. I brush against a cello case and it nearly falls. I catch it and put it back. Then I see what looks like tall, thin, fine, dark wood cabinets. I go to look, touching one that tumbles against the others, almost causing a chain reaction. The once thin case opens, as is a bass fiddle case. I get it all put back and am attracted to a revolving set of walls which have pillows hanging on them. I look and then move on to a table where there are books and cameras and so on. I pick up a fat book with a thick cellophane plastic cover. I see it is a working script book for a classic movie called "My Dear ____" (maybe wife). I am intrigued because I had chosen this movie to dissect to learn how to do a movie. The added attraction to the book is that there are special insider notes about how the "real" directors do it. I look at the price. $15.00 seems a lot. Then I see I got mixed up and that is the price of a book called Wizard of Oz. I then see the right price is $11.95. I decide it's worth it and take the book. Then I see a camera, a Lieka small portable. I turn it over and try to see the back. It says Polaroid. It was $132.00 dollars when new, but I can buy it for $12.00. I choose it too. Then I find an intriguing pottery piece. It is like a small compact vase to put food in like a snack tray. The beauty of it is that it unfolds so that the main vase part holds bread sticks and dip. The other petals fold out to create a trail of platters, each a different colored pottery to hold the veggies. It is adorable. I take it too. Later I take all this back to the office and show the man, who is now like Derek. He looks at the pottery piece and says, "Well, you'll have trouble with Charla. She'll want to play with it all the time." I say, "Oh well, I'll keep it anyway. I'll put it away when she comes to visit." He chuckles at me for getting so many things I like when sent on the mission of getting him a carpet. (which I also did get). (960 words)

A good-looking young man, maybe 29 years old, seems very charming. Dovre and I are attending some growth seminar. He joins us. Then, he starts exhibiting psychotic behaviors. He grabs a doll and holds it to his penis and pees on it, right in front of me, while smiling charmingly at me after he had just violently ravaged the doll. Then again he grabs my daughter, Dovre, as she is laying on the floor, only she becomes another doll. I grab the doll and say, "No. You can't." We wrestle over the doll and I force it away from him. He is intense and single-minded. I go over and whisper to the woman who is running the workshop, "We have a psychotic person here; get security." She leaves to do that. Then I see Paul C and two of his men who walk up to me nonchalantly. He says, "Where is he?" I look around. He had gone outside, to pee in the woods. I see him coming back toward the door. We are standing in the open door and he sees the big, obviously police men. He veers away and starts to walk away. I try to walk out to entice him back in a friendly manner, but he's onto us. I am annoyed at Paul and his men for being so obvious. A good-looking man, one of the security ones, only more feminine-looking and a slight build, says, "Maybe I can convince him to come over." I say, "You are probably right. I'm pretty sure he is homosexual and schizophrenic. Watch out for him, he is very charming on the outside and dangerous as hell." (277 words)

I am hearing a radio report about a new kind of ski lift that uses pressurized air to shoot the person straight up to the high place, and then it's a roller coaster kind of ride down. You lean backward on the air and ride down, fast and exciting. I'm up there, having done the first half of the ride. I look down and see Dovre, my daughter, laying on her tummy asleep, on a bench. I see one big crow or raven and four of five little ones sitting on her back. As she stirs, they fly up a bit and settle down on her again. I see the big one go sit on a boy's head. I know this is magic stuff, and realize the boy has been chosen by the raven, the wise one. I call to Dovre and tell her what I see, asking if she can see it too. I say, "There's a prairie chicken in the kitchen too." I see a top-knotted African kind of bird. They all look so real. I wonder if they can be seen by others and feel a slight fear that if they are real, they could just scratch or hurt the boy and Dovre. But I do know they are "dreams" or "other world." The spirits.

A woman director, dark-haired, and famous is on TV doing her regular show. I think her name is Carol Lawrence, or something like that. Her friend Lucille Ball decides she wants to come on the show as a surprise and tease her friend. She prepares by putting on ear muffs and two square boxes, one over each ear. She wonders for a moment if she should do this. Would people think it silly or untasteful? She decides to trust her instincts. She goes on, surprising the crew, and then Carol. It ends up being a classic touching and humorous bit that people found endearing. (104 words)

He tries to describe this insightful moment to Jack Benny. He reaches over to a lamp, which is in the swimming pool, and unplugs it (or plugs it in, I don't remember which way it goes) and then carries the lamp and begins to follow me (the woman) as I get out of the pool. He stands directly behind me, wanting contact. I become aware of him. (100 words)

I have (or some woman has) created a theatre or movie set. She puts on shows there, but this upsets a man and a woman in the next room/area. It's their stuff to do that and this upstart has taken over their space. They come after her. Then it's like the same story, but it's Warren Beatty that lives in a huge castle/mansion. He's very rich. He has a jealous sister. He buys out her upper stories part of the mansion to create a theatre. He's up in the big room when a jealous boyfriend type man comes up. Warren wants to hide, but the room is empty. A trap door opens on the ceiling and a bed comes down from the hidden sky roof room. It lands on him, unfolding like an accordion. It hides him. The man tries to drag him out and beat him up. Then as though the dream repeats the story, the bed thing comes down again and hides him, only there is a beautiful spirit woman that lives up there and Warren is in love with her and wants to join her. He resists. Then his other sister and her daughter, his niece, come to the castle to see him, I think at his request. She (the niece) is now the dream ego. I/she walks into the corridor of the castle and see a huge door roll open, like in a dungeon. I peek in to its dark depths. I make fun of the image of Warren being courted by that beautiful woman spirit. I "see" her coming toward him, beckoning to him. He feels unable to resist her force. Spooky, I think, "Maybe Death is there!" I then see a huge, dark black-robed figure of death come toward me. I feel fear and start backing up. He comes gliding right after me and grabs me by the arms. He starts forcing me back toward the other wall. Maybe there's another door there. I struggle and now he's behind me dragging me down the hall. I resist, saying to him, "But I'm not ready yet. I'm too young." He laughs. He makes a joke. I poke his bony leg at the knee with a fork. Like right, that's going to help. He feels no pain. This is DEATH! He has a death grip on me and I am afraid. There is no way out; he has me. (403 words)

A man, Richard Chamberlain, and I are deeply in love. Another woman is in love with him. He and she are sort of engaged. She is American Indian. He must stay with her because of the vows. It is painfully poignant when we are together, because we know we can't have each other. There is some ceremony where he is placed between two cloth partitions (sheets). He is kneeling, like in a confessional. She stands on the left side behind the sheet, and I stand on the right side, peeking out from the split in my sheet (like two curtains pulled together). He smiles at me, sadly. Then she begins to get hysterical, accusing him of being untrue and doing her wrong. As her accusations get more hysterical and untrue and harsh, the entire tribe begins to see it is wrong. They walk away from her. She is now sobbing and screaming that she had been to the doctor's this morning and got bad news. Finally she's on the floor sobbing. Everyone has left the building except me and Peter Jennings. I resolutely stand up from her fallen body and walk away, now leaving her entirely alone. I feel very sad for her and worried she will kill herself. I say to Peter after we are outdoors, "I don't know how long I can bear to stay away. I'll probably return and stay with her for a while." I see my lover walking toward me. He and I meet, and lay down together slowly on the cement stairs. He touches my cloth collar at my neck caressingly, a forbidden touch, but we must connect. I sigh and say, "I think she's dying," and then I say, "It feels so good to be near you." He says, "Yes, for me too." (300 words)

I am at some resort hotel or something, a conference. I am tired and want to lay down for a nap in my room before going to town to sightsee with my brothers. I can't find my room. I walk down a row of desks like in school, to a wall where I thought there was a door. There is no door. I go down another hall and see doors and open one and go in, but find myself in an enclosed corridor that leads to the fun house kiddie attraction. I say, "What the heck," and go for the ride, thinking when I get there I'll find the exit and go to my room. The rug is like a conveyer belt and then there's a steep set of stairs that is more like a ladder. We go down. My brother Jake is there. He introduces me to a young girl (maybe 19 years old) named Casey. "Humm," I think, "maybe his new girlfriend." We arrive at the place, but it's a big auditorium where a comedy writing contest is going on and being judged. One of my scripts is in the contest. A woman is tired and wants to go to her room because the conference starts again early tomorrow. Dwight is around, but he looks like Rock Hudson and I say, "We can go to town and sightsee later." He says he doesn't really want to go; the conference is too important to waste time on that. I still want to go, later. I convince the woman to wait for the results of the contest, by saying most earnestly that if we leave, we'd only have to make Dwight bring us back really early in the morning and that wastes more time. Now the judge comes over with his sheaf of papers. A man who runs the place is crazy for me and is bothering me by insisting we get together. I keep kindly but firmly repulsing him. He is a driven guy who won't accept no. He tries to hug me and pull me away and talks to get my attention. "What is it you want?" he asks. I say, "I want to get the results (the range of points from the different judges) so I can figure out what I did wrong and get better with my writing." The judge says, "You did pretty well, really." I'm sort of a runner up. I try to write down the scores, losing the page and searching for it again. I can't find them and the man says, "Here's the code on this page. You look for this symbol and it tells you what page." I try again. As I am looking, he walks across the gym floor, bossing his employees around arrogantly. I smile at him, because even though he is obnoxious, there is something endearing about his single-minded love for me. He comes back and tries to convince me to go to his room. I laugh and say, "No, but I will give you a kiss, like a ceremony to knight you, because I can see that somewhere under all that brashness is a real human being. You have to learn to let him out so we can enjoy him." He's all over me, taking advantage and I laugh, pushing him away and say, "Oh, beknighted one, arise and be a knight." (565 words)

I am at some information booth and a woman is selling her wares. It is some new age group that sounds very good and intriguing and yet I have some doubts. Maybe they are a cult that starts invading your privacy and thoughts. I look at the children's books, a special device and some other things. I keep asking questions. I decide to buy some of the items to look at them in detail later. Now They show me an apartment I could rent, in Dover. It is a small one bedroom, with two double beds like in a motel room. A man and I are interested, but again, still unsure and hesitant. I ask the fat landlady what the rent would be she says it depends, ____ on down to 500 dollars. This sounds high to me, and the place isn't all that good a shape. but now she shows us it has a living room, a dining room and several more bedrooms. It is looking more like a good deal. The bed in the back bedroom is a narrow cot like thing. I test it and it turns out to be a flimsy hammock cloth. I ask if it is a hammock. She says no, that's not the bed. The bed would be brought in later and we'd have to sign a paper saying they removed the critters. It was some kind of an insurance scam. I don't feel good about it. She then hands me a brochure on the cheap computer they offer for sale. $13.95 and it does recipes and appointments and so on. I saw some strange contrivance in the bedroom that looked like a bathroom scale taped to a woodstove chimney that was that device. I look out the back windows to check out the neighborhood. Odd looking people, fat like a cow (and looked at first like he had an udder) and so on. We're not sure this is going to be good, but we are still interesting in finding out more. (339 words)

A sort of taciturn, sad or grumpy man gives me a gift. I look in the box and see some sort of leather wine pouches, of different sizes. I say oh, that will be nice. I can put them on my wheelchair for water bags. He says nothing. I look more closely and see there are small miniature things in the bag. I see 30 tiny florescent light tubes, in their boxes. and many more things. I begin to realize that this isn't a wine bag but a miniature room with furnishings. I keep opening little things and other little things are in them. This thing keeps getting more ornate and big and full of stuff. I like it very much and hope I haven't offended the man by not understanding the nature of the gift right off. (138 words)

I am staying at a house, perhaps my mother's house. Ellie is there as well. There are many rooms but I sleep in a tiny one twin size bed, if fact, I don't even sleep in the bed, I am uncomfortably curled up in my wheelchair and sleeping. Ellie starts to move her things to a bigger nicer room and it occurs to me I could do that too. I mention to my mother that I'd like to hire a part time helper as I can't do things for myself and would like to be comfortable. and I want to move to a nicer bigger room and sleep comfortably on a bed.

I am in a house with a lot of rooms. I decide to get on my exercise machine and discover it is broken. I realize I'd been enrolled in a business college course load and haven't been going to classes. How odd it will be to have a Masters degree and yet flunk simple courses. It will look bad on my record. I don't want to take the classes. I move into the living room, which has my father's bed in it. There is a sort of V. House feeling to this place. I try to use the exercise machine there, but no luck. I go back and count the rooms, and as I look more closely, I see the rooms are quite small and square and ordinary, which is the opposite of what my dream rooms have been like in other dreams. Jake is in a bed in the back bedroom. (152 words)

A chubby, flabby boy is a Buddha emperor boy and the priest comes up to him. The boy shoves his fat belly down to make a pillow for the priest, who lays his head on the belly, a sort of ritual greeting of emperor and priest. Now they raise him to sitting and drape his fat, flaccid penis over the edge of his bed and he pees. I watch, fascinated. It's such an odd shape penis and the boy is so spoiled he doesn't even use his muscles to lift himself up. It is all done for him by the priests. (101 words)

Derek/Darryl and I are going to the movies together, but first we go to his house to get something. We are talking as I gather up a wallet and borrow one of his. His buddies (the homeless motley crew guys) come over to hang out while we're at the movies. I look in the bathroom mirror and see my face and sigh. I think to myself, "I'd make an OK-looking man." I feel sad because I know Derek doesn't feel attracted to me and never will. I say, "I'll shut the window" and then say, "Oh yeah, that's right. You never lock anything. I do at my place, but it's a different kind of neighborhood, tougher." He starts to disagree with me and I get annoyed and say, "But, you don't know. I was almost..." I pause, I was about to say raped. He realizes that's what I was going to say and tries to listen. Chelsea then joins us. I feel the need to pee. We three walk to the movie house. (173 words)

I am sort of Sally Fields as a comedian. I come out on the stage, in front of the huge, billowing curtain. I, the dream ego, is watching from the wings. I see Sally dressed in a blue sequined gown with see-through overdress and her act is taking off parts of the outfit and the outfit look keeps changing. Now I am her and I look far down at the small and distant audience. The billowing curtain nearly knocks me off stage. I keep hissing at the curtain woman to open the curtains a bit more. She finally does. I come up with a funny bit of lines where I wait until they get nervous at me not speaking and then I say, "This comedy thing is harder than I thought. Apparently you have to say witty things and then they love you...apparently not. And they have to be funny to other people too." The audience laughs, but they are also dancing and running around. They are so far away they look miniscule. (173 words)

Charla and I are together in a big double bed with lots of space between us. I pick up a ring of hers and put it on, hoping she doesn't wake up and demand it back. It is an odd ring, an engagement -like look and then a long row of gold squares and another round engagement-like ring at the end of that. I see the second part is a separate ring, plastic, that just got stuck on the end. I think it's fun to pretend I have an engagement ring. (91 words)

I am an extra actress. I'm just in the background being a person sitting at a cafe table. The main actors are at other tables doing the play and I am supposed to improv gestures and pretend I am talking to other people and so on for the entire play. I keep coming up with ideas on what to do and even make a few funny remarks that could have been good lines in the play. The director, a man, wants me to make what I'm doing even bigger because it is so good. He dresses as a woman and wanders across the stage pretending to be one of the cafe extras and signals me to act as if I am leaving to go to the restroom. I do so, going off stage and he says to me, "I like what you're doing; keep on and make it bigger." I nod and go back on stage. More extras are there imitating me. (162 words)

I hear about a road that suddenly caught on fire. Apparently some cars with steel belted radial tires worn down to the steel were on the road, and rust spots were on the road. It was oil soaked from years of use and it caught on fire. I ask where this is, thinking it is on a coast in some exotic locale. Oh, and it is snowing there a lot, but the snow won't put out the fire. It will burn for years. I hear it is in the state of Washington. I guess I'm hearing a radio reporter interview someone. He asks if the road is closed and now no one can travel there. The man replies, "Yes, but we have the old road people can use." The reporter says, "But that one is windy and slow, right?" I see huge clumps of land mass with gaps in-between like the road will be built to cross those coastal gaps. It will make for hard, slow traveling. (167 words)

I am meeting my director in a department store. I get into an elevator and it isn't working properly, missing the exact mark to stop, so he decides to fix the thing while we are on it, which makes me a bit nervous. Now we go to an area to rehearse and basically he hands me the pages for the scene and talks me through the summary of what happens. Then I need to go to the bathroom and find one and pee. Now it is almost time for my scene. I feel a bit insecure because I might lose the lines. I have a few seconds of almost a panic feeling and then calm down and go. I am playing a silly director and wear a green beret and a butch short haircut, with pretty-colored gray and black hair like Mirabelle. I ham it up, making funny faces and following my director, who is also acting a part around the set because I realize we've never worked the blocking. Now the audience gets very vocal and noisy until we have to stop. I look out at them and they are fighting amongst themselves. We wait for a while, watching. They are seated like in a church balcony, and a bunch in the back, mostly men are standing and pushing and shoving and yelling. Then I see way up at the top, three or four rows of the young girls in communion dresses all leaving. Now they calm down a bit and I say to my director, "I'm going to go get my script because we've really had no rehearsal or blocking," and he agrees. I rush backstage to find the pages and am looking through a pile on a bed, couch thing. Another more veteran actress is saying something and I say, "You must help me find my script first because I'm on now. It's in a white folder." She agrees and I find the pages, feeling a bit bad about not being prepared, but OK because It wasn't my fault and we'll get through this OK. I go back on stage, looking at my director to help me know where to restart the scene. (366 words)

A man is standing and holds a baby by its hands as it is trying to stand up. I watch and the baby is a kitten and it scampers around. I want to play with it. I see it go under a chair and see that a much smaller kitten is in there. It's about the size of a mouse. I am worried that the bigger kitten will hurt it or eat it, and I crawl under to distract the bigger kitten. I play with it and rub its cute, fat little tummy. It likes that and leaves the smaller kitten alone. (102 words)

I take two male roommates to help with expenses. They put a sign over the door saying something like The Boys of Love or something. They see two young women they are interested in moving their furniture out in the hall and run out to ask if they are leaving the building. The women say no, they are moving to an apartment upstairs because it is cheaper. The boys are relieved. Now we go back into my apartment, which we are remodeling. They have taken up the carpet and rolled it up and put it in the hall. I see the floor and wonder if I made a mistake because the floor is very ugly and I will have to re-carpet the place, which will be expensive. Now I am showing the place to Paulina and Clarice (Paulina's daughter). I point out there are five different areas that represent five different characters. I see lots of early American wood stuff and decide I don't like that style. I see a picture of a woman in black and white and remember showing the same picture to Clarice when it was in full color. It is a large wall portrait of a woman standing. I go back out of this end area. Paulina says, "Here at least it looks like you," meaning the furniture and accessories are mine. I smile and say yes. Now I see Millie talking to another young woman relative. She then looks at a wood carved statue of several people in a canoe and I am explaining how sad the one woman figure is. She can't seem to see it. I try several times to point it out to her. Naomi asks something. I say, "Oh, yes, books all over, but this section the books aren't mine. They belong to one of the characters. I can't even find a book on those shelves I care to read." (319 words)

Susie S and I are walking along a road talking. I am feeling a bit defensive and hurt as she is saying we have a problem because I begrudged her two hours of work that she felt I still owed her. I say, "No, wait. Begrudged? I don't begrudge you those two hours." I feel a bit dishonest because I do feel I gave her what was required. I try to speak honestly. I say, "It's the sarcasm. I don't deal well with sarcasm, and I thought I had done the work well and gave you all that was required, so I felt hurt." She says, "Then you'd be willing to meet me tomorrow morning to talk this all out?" I think to myself, "I hope not too early," then I say, "Yes, of course. I just don't do well with sarcasm and feeling attacked. I admire and respect you and your work and if you feel I shorted you in hours, I will give you the hours." She seems to understand and says she's sorry she was sarcastic; it is a bad habit of hers. We continue to work it on out. (193 words)

I come to a family reunion. I am in a hotel room and I get up. The two young girls are playing very noisily so I can't sleep. I am looking for my hair and tooth brush but I realize I haven't packed them. How annoying. Well, I'll borrow my mother's. I see a pile of books I did pack. There's a Georgette Heyer book and many others some from my youth. I want to curl up and read them all, but there is no time. I will never have time to just read them, all the ones I like. Oh well. Now I go into the bathroom where the two girls are playing, being noisy and using other people's stuff. I tell them to stop it and find something to brush my teeth with. Now I return to my room and see the maid is there making up my bed, putting new sheets on it. She's a slovenly dressed, plump lady who sort of lays down as he works. I notice she has waxed the floor and it is slippery and there are thick iodine red or that Benodine stuff they use at the hospital, red puddles on the floor. I slip and slide my way precariously out the door. Now I have to get down the very steep (like a ladder) stairs without slipping and falling. I hold on hard to the wood post on the banister and carefully walk down. Then I start going faster and start skipping steps, and finally at the end step on a couch and hop over some things and jump the last flight of stairs and land unhurt on the ground floor. I see someone, a woman, watching me and I see I left some slipper marks on a step or two and the back of the couch. I am kind of surprised I didn't hurt myself on that last jump. So now I get to the room where the reunion is happening. I see Patricia and her husband Morton, and music is playing and people are in Halloween costumes except me. I didn't choose to wear a costume. Now I am dancing with Patricia's husband and I don't know the steps because it is a country dance, but he wraps his legs strongly with mine and I follow his lead very well. At the end of the dance he is surprised when I say I've never danced this kind of dance before. He is impressed. I go to find the relatives I like. As I walk through the room, I see Grandma Mildred there and am surprised because she's been dead for years. She looks years younger and rejuvenated. She is still an older woman, but she has cleavage and somewhat pretty breasts, long pretty hair and is in a sexy white negligee gown thing. Millie comes over and says, "Hey, I only want to talk to the ones I find interesting or that I like," meaning her mom and me. My mother is nearby, watching. Grandma is chatting and Millie wants to talk real and important things. I wander off and a band is being set up to entertain us and I say to the organizing woman, "Let me do a few things while the band is setting up." She at first is reluctant because usually my stuff has been boring or repetitive. I tell her, "I won't do the old stuff, like Evangeline; I'll do a new comedy routine and a dance number I learned." She hesitates, but since I agreed to do it while the band is setting up, it's OK, so I go out into the center of the room. The benches (like church pews) are placed in a theatre in the round style, but some of the benches face away from me. I start talking a comedy routine and at first it's pretty deadly quiet in terms of laughs. As I continue and build, they start becoming more interested and laughing until I have their attention and they enjoy my routine, which is improv and just me talking. Now I am going to dance and I call for my partner. Now the point of view shifts and I am in the audience watching this beautiful flighty woman and her partner dance. I am sitting on the floor in the gentle arms of some man. Now the male dance partner comes over and comedically opens his cape to reveal boxer shorts over tights. He wiggles his hips and the shorts fall down around his ankles, only there's another pair there and he repeats this two more times. The man I'm with gets a bit worried as this is a family audience and the children are there. Then the male dancer grabs his crotch and makes an obscene gesture. I am uncomfortable, but hoping everyone sees it's for comedic effect. Now the woman dancer with wonderful, curly long hair begins to dance and she steps on the back of a bench and twirls and dances around the room. (840 words)

Leighanne, a man, and another woman and I have ordered some food from Taco Time. We get our order but it is all wrong. Who ordered the Enchilada, or the chicken nuggets and the burritos came with everything and so on. I ask the others if they are willing to accept the order. I see a few things I would be willing to eat and from lack of interest, we all decide to keep, or rather a decision is never actually made. We just didn't do anything about it. I am looking for the chicken nuggets, but the pretty woman ate them. She is wearing a beige, lacy, sexy dress and I wonder if the overdress is mine, but it's just her shawl. She is like Jessica Lange in "Blue Sky," very sexy. She is wondering where the costume department is. She goes off looking and I try to pack up the food stuff and my shoes and this and that. Then, John (a fellow teacher) is a black man and he is doing funny impersonations. He's doing one where he must walk backwards in front of a person (also a black man) who is walking toward him and as he does this, he is talking like he is threatening this person, like he has the power. This is very funny and he says it only is funny when he walks backwards at the same time he is trying to sound threatening. Then the black man asks him to do another impersonation. He does a famous important man, maybe Martin Luther King. He is very good and he is also still walking backwards as they go into the Theatre Department building. Now I go into a classroom and John is there, only now he looks like Robert Young, in "The Second Woman," about a man who might be paranoid and dangerous, but the woman loves him. A black man comes in and John and he are having an argument that is at an impasse. John teaches class on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 1:00 to 2:30 and the "Makeup Man" wants that room at that time. Neither is willing to budge. I take the role of fascinator or mediator. I write on a blackboard the headings "Makeup Man" in a purple/pink chalk, and on the right side of the board, I write "Instructor." We are going to list all the objections until we can come to some compromise. I notice the Instructor space is larger and more convenient to get to and say, "Oh, oh. I am not being fair. I'm already biased." I go to another board and try to make it equal. (443 words)

I am lying on a couch, burning a candle and watching it burn. It goes out and I try to relight it, but now there are two, no, three, no, four wicks. I light them and one or two go out and I relight them. Now they are all burning and as I hold the candle in my hands, it is now a square of wax and melting very quickly in a strong line down the middle. I realize it will melt through and it does, breaking into two pieces. I ineptly say, "Oh, Oh, Oh," as the hot wax splashes out over the coffee table and on the carpeted floor. Just then, as I am up and grabbing a towel to clean up the mess, I notice the front door is slowly opening. I go to the door, afraid and try to close it, but two teen boys, one very blonde and has mild CP, are in the room and I know they intend to rape or hurt me. I say, "No, no, no," in an inept way and open the door for them to go out. I try to insist, but they laugh and I manage to get them out and shut the door and lock it. I know they are going around to the back door. I go to the phone and dial the whole number for the police department and wonder why I didn't just dial 911. I give my name, Barb Sanders, and my address, 795 W. Street, #302, E City. I say, "These teens are breaking in and I'm afraid they will hurt me, and I need someone to come and check it out, just in case." The police don't seem too interested in helping me. (292 words)

Charla is deliberately refusing to obey me. She is running down the stone steps of a huge Catholic church. I am very, very angry at her and crying and upset. I cry out to her, "You must stop. Come here at once," and so on and she laughs at me and keeps on going. I know somehow that to keep chasing after her and pleading in anger isn't going to work and I should withdraw, but I am driven by my strong feelings to continue. It's as though I can't stop. Jake comes up the steps and I see he is going into a room that has religious statues and I hope he will at least nod his head toward them in respect, although he won't do the Catholic thing, seeing as he isn't Catholic.

I am on some deserted island place, and I see a brown, strong naked woman run past me. I follow her to a pool. It is a ritual bathing place. I and some other person with me go into the pool, not knowing what we are supposed to do or why we are supposed to do it. There is a recessed shallow spot off the deep larger pool and I/we are in it. I look out and see the pool is deep and empty. The water is very clear. But I sense danger around. I see a huge crocodile swim past me, its tail braided. I am not sure if it is merely an animal crocodile, or if it is an intelligent life form. It crawls out on land and signs in as Captain Morg. I stay in my shallow area afraid to go out into the larger pool. Now a car drives out onto the water, does a turn and drives back. These people aren't afraid. Then a person walks across the water to the hallway on the other side. I look into the hallway and see a group of people walking toward the pool and an exit sign glowing at the far end of the hallway. I feel stupid and cowardly hanging back in my little recessed area as these other people matter-of-factly go about their business. (229 words)

I am walking along and see a child movie star. She will play the lead in a children's movie. Now I go into a large room set up with backless benches and a few chairs for children to watch the movie. I sit on one of the chairs because the benches would give me a backache. But the chair keeps sliding backward. I pull it back to where it should be and it slides again. I can't seem to stop it. I wonder why I am wasting my time watching this movie which is either Wizard of Oz or Cinderella, when I could be watching one of my taped movies. The screen is far away and is a white bed sheet. I won't be able to see well. I think I'm there because I'm curious and drawn to the fact that there is an "important" person there, namely the famous child movie star, even though I am not particularly interested in her or her movie.

I seem to be the prison warden. The men are surly and dangerous. I have to stop something and I use fast karate blows. I am damn good at it and beat my foe. Another powerful inmate is watching me closely, looking for his opportunity. I then go to the infirmary for the doctor to bind up my wounds, but he is also my fiance and he rejects me, I think because he doesn't want me doing this dangerous job. I am hurt, but bravely go on. I return, exhausted and emotionally drained, to my office and find a young woman and a Hispanic man trying to make out on the floor by my door. I tell her to be in my office at 3 o'clock and I'll teach her about birth control and then I decide the man better be there too. This was yet another betrayal and I am angry and self-righteous, and yet I'm trying to be doing the right thing for these people too. I enter, but it isn't my office; it is a courtroom. I interrogate the prisoner who is on trial, the man I beat up, and the other powerful man is secretly sending him signals by scraping the legs of his chair against the floor when he should not answer. I realize this is a code even though it is subtle. I am on the alert. [BL] (233 words)

I am a member of a woman's club. The president of the club and another woman get into a scandal thing with one woman supposedly moving in on the other's husband. There are two teen boys as well that kind of do the same kind of thing, one taking something the other has. Now the president doesn't come to meetings. I guess she is ashamed. Time passes, and at a meeting I watch as the two women start talking it all through and now the whole thing is understood and accepted and behind them. The president resumes her duties. Now I am at a woman's house. I am admiring a special tree where she has grafted different fruits on it. There are grapes and cantaloupes and bananas on it. I am very impressed. How neat to grow your own fresh fruit, all on one convenient tree. I look at a series of glass tubes with liquid stuff bubbling around in them. I ask some questions. These tubes are the special acid/ph factor balance stuff for this special tree. Now I am eating a cantaloupe from the tree, only as much as I say, Ummm, how tasty," it really isn't. I keep scraping out these masses of black seeds, like watermelon seeds. It never seems to end. The bites are stringy and pulpy. I finally realize this isn't good fruit. Now I go inside to help the woman decide to leave her husband. She hasn't opened her mind to what misery she is really experiencing in the relationship. Now she sees it. (261 words)

I am at a Family Reunion, the Sanders side, I think, lots of cousins and small children and babies. Some of the small children are very active and noisy and as much as I love being around them; it is hard. Now I am sitting behind Aunt Abigail and somebody talking to someone, maybe my father. I watch as Francis P hides behind a door and watches as Delilah comes in to ask if Francis got a present. I laugh and whisper to my father, "Isn't that something, how he sent his wife in to ask for something?" Abigail turns around and I peer closely at her bright hazel eyes. They are intense and quite pretty, with many golden flecks of color. I laugh, a bit uncomfortably, feeling caught. I say, "You sure are pissed at me." She says, "You don't like them, do you." They are too rowdy for you. I feel embarrassed and try to fix things with a bit of a white lie. I say, "Well, that's true, we aren't the same kind of people, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy them the one day of the year we see each other. I thought it was kind of cute." This mollifies my Aunt and I am relieved, for she was as intense as a mother bear protecting her cubs. The reunion goes on and now I am watching my father's montage TV screen, a special machine to create a montage of past events. He had already edited the reunion footage and added a narrator's voice, his own voice, to it. I see myself in a pretty dress, low bodice and a small waist. I look good. I am wearing a pretty wide brim hat and posing with smiles. Then I am playing a silly role of a very fat or pregnant woman in the same dress. Then I am riding one of the small horses, not Ginger. I am riding the brown one and I see myself from the back end as the horse trots and then playfully gallops. I ride her through a sprinkler. It is fun and we stop to soak up the cool water. A pinto horse is named Ginger. The noisy child that is hard to be around likes the horses. (379 words)

I am seated on a couch and Leroy, my cousin, comes over and sits near me to kiss me goodbye. He and his wife are going home. I love him and I feel he loves me. We lightly hug, as his wife is standing there watching, almost in slow motion, I lean up and our lips are close together. We steal a soft, loving kiss in a way that the wife can't see. Now he goes home. I find some reason to go there. The wife is very suspicious of us and we are very careful, but we are indeed in love and take every stolen moment we can to brush up against each other or look into each other's eyes. This is a difficult life we are moving toward, a suspicious wife, we don't want to hurt her. They have been in a good relationship for years, but our feelings are too strong and we can't resist. Apparently I was in a play, because Leroy says to his friend, "Tell her you liked the play." He comes over and says, "Yes, Grandmother, I loved your play." He was very polite. He and I talk about how special and alive one feels on stage. Even if you are not alive and ordinary off stage, you can always go back on stage and recapture that special alive feeling. (227 words)

I think I had been traveling in Europe and have returned. I am now on a country road, looking for a small town I used to live in. I pass the town and end up in some other small town. I stop at a house and a woman says she will walk with me for a ways until I get my directions. I say, "I think I'm looking for L City or A City." We come over a rise and look down into the valley and see farmlands and a spire on a university brick building. I say, "We are in Mo City, the Western (state) State University." Some woman asks me the name of the main hall. I say, "I can't remember." I remember the one for L. and I remember the one for another university. It is a very pretty scene. (143 words)

A small girl is in danger. I am trying to protect her. A male gangster has a gun and henchmen and is trying to poison or take the little girl. The girl is very afraid. I see a box delivered to her and in it is a bottle like Fiberall and she's afraid of it. She is lying in the box with plastic inserts like ears next to her head. She looks terrified. I take her out and hear the gangster coming and tell her to go into the bathroom and hide. She does. The gangster has a gun on me and I have a gun on him and we threaten each other. It's a standoff. I feel great hatred for him. He's mean and persistent, but somehow he's not really trying to be a bad guy. We keep up the threatening stuff at each other. (146 words)

I spent the day looking around and exploring a huge mall or market place, which feels like the Internet. A man and I become acquainted and we informally wander around together. That night I go home to my father's house, where I live. The man and I are discussing about maybe getting together again tomorrow and seeing something that we both are interested in, but there's an interruption. I go into my bathroom and notice the bathtub faucet is leaking. I turn it closed and give it one last turn for good measure, to help conserve water, but this starts a drip and then a stream of water from the shower, which is perpendicular to the bath tub. It can't be fixed by adjusting the knobs and now a lot of small jets of water are spraying out over the bathroom. I leave to go find my father in the living room to tell him to fix it or get a plumber. I walk at a fast trot for what seems like miles and finally reach the living room. I am amazed how big the house is. It's not very convenient. I remind myself to get everyone in the family's phone extension numbers. Next time I'll call. I find my father seated in a small coal bucket-like thing with two kids. He's reading them a story and I call to him, but he can't seem to hear me. I try several times and finally he looks up. I tell him about the problem, and we start walking back quickly to my bathroom. It is a long journey. I realize I'd left that poor man up in the air about tomorrow and wonder if he'll come back. I feel bad. We arrive to find the man in the bathroom and he's fixed the problem. He put in a few washers and some small plastic cups to shield the faucet in case it does it again. I thank him and he says, "It's nothing," but does manage to mention it cost him 20 dollars for the plastic things, but he needed some himself, so it's OK. I want to pay him back and I am unclear if this is my father's expense, as it's his house, or if it's mine, because I am an adult and I live here. I want to pay for it myself. I try to introduce the man to my mother but can't remember his name and apologize, making a small joke about no brain cells left after a long day at the mall. I remember his name is Martin.

I am a woman who is interviewing for a job. A man named Will is across the desk from me. He looks like Liam Neeson in Nell. I tell him I was fired and there was sexual harassment and so on. He asks me if he's the first person I've interviewed with. I say dryly, "No indeed. As you probably guessed, I have had lots of interviews but no one will take a chance on me. They think, like I think you are thinking now, that it will happen to them. I will accuse them of sexual harassment, like I'm the perpetrator, not the victim." He looks sympathetic. Then I see a scene happening in the next room down the hall. A beautiful woman is distraught. She is resisting going into a room and she calls out "Bear, Bear," which seems to be a name of a small child who disappeared or was hurt. She is sobbing. I see a mask that a child drew on the wall. I also see a written report that says "Domestic Violence." Now Will leaves the room and I wait for his answer. As I wait, a small odd-looking man, like a leprechaun in a business suit, walks conspicuously through the room calling my attention to him, nonverbally. I watch as he leaves the room by a side door and then I look out the window as he sneaks back around to the next door and sneaks back into the hall. "Humm," I think, "he needed me to be a witness to his leaving. There's something fishy going on here." Will returns and is kind to me. He shows me a glass figurine of a horse which belonged to the other woman. I hold it on my arm and look closely. At first it is a glass figurine of a shoe, an elf or ancient woman's shoe, then it is a horse on spindly glass triangle legs. The legs break off and I am trying to reattach them. I notice there are shoes on the ends of the horse's legs like the shoe the entire figurine was at the beginning. (356 words)

I go into a church and I find Derek lying on a leather chaise lounge kind of couch. He is staring contemplatively at two or three paintings set up on easels. They look like his dream pictures. I walk past, greeting him and put something away and then come back. I look at the first picture and see a horse. Then as I look at other details I am struck with how dynamic this picture is. As I shift field of vision, different depths become active, vital and to the forefront of my awareness. The middle ground becomes illuminated and I look at it, and then I am drawn into the background, which happens to be horses raining from the sky, and mountains. I turn to Derek and tell him what I saw and how amazing this sifting of perspective is. I like the picture very much. I sit next to him as we talk. He is silent and contemplative. He adjusts his position to make room for me near him. I reach for something across his chest as I am talking, which places me in a sort of hug position across his body. As I do this, he touches my hair tenderly and says very softly, "Will you....marry me?" I hear the "Will you" and guess that the words are marry me, although I do not actually hear them. I say, "I can't hear you. What did you say?" He touches my hair and I can't tell if it is just a casual caress or a real sign of affection. I want it to be, but I don't want to respond as if it is unless I know it is, so I won't scare him and embarrass me. I touch his hair in a caressing manner. The feelings are very confused and mostly I feel ambiguous and he is ambiguous. It is tender and I like it. Then he gets up and moves several of my file cabinets for me. I guess I'm moving my office to this area. He is helping me place things. I examine the placement and say, "Would you mind if these two cabinets (which were mine) are first in line with the others (from a previous office owner)?" "No problem." We move them. (379 words)

I am trying to teach a class about subtle communication stuff like nonverbal behavior. I am talking about small eye movements and so on when I see they have left, maybe a recess or they are restless or something. They come back in and I continue to try and teach. The man teacher who had been distant is now trying to help me. We end up burning a pile of garbage and cardboard. Somehow this is a together, helping thing. (80 words)

I am in a hospital getting blood, or giving it, with maybe a surgery coming up. I am in a hospital corridor looking for the elevator. A woman comes up and introduces herself. Apparently I know her. She asks me if I will go see Santa Claus. I say, "Oh, maybe." I look down over the railing at the Santa surrounded by kids. He smiles up at me in an inviting way. I then start to go around the corner to find the stairs. Howard comes up and asks to borrow my glasses. I give my second pair. I am now wearing a Santa suit, a round ball for a fat belly. The jacket is open. I am walking down the stairs and kids look at me. I close the jacket. I go around the corner and find the line for Santa. Howard comes back up after the Santa thing. I need some glasses and he offers his to me. I laugh, saying, "I'll try but I won't be able to see anything," since his prescription is worse than mine. I look at them before I put them on and am surprised to see they are one huge lens, not two. I put them on and can see just fine. I tell him I like his better, because mine are trifocals and hard to see out of. A man watches, friendly like. (232 words)

I am sitting on a couch cushion that sits beside the couch. The problem is, the couch is in a large body of water. It is getting soaked through and beginning to sink. I am aware there may be danger in the water, sharks, perhaps. I go to dry land. There is possible war there as well. Now I am going to go to an informal audition. I had shrugged it off at first, not particularity interested in home grown theatrics, but decide to participate, feeling like this is a cinch, I can do this in my sleep. I decide to change clothes. I go into another room where Deirdre, my cousin is. I ask to borrow some clothes. I choose some pink sweater and a skirt. I look at it and realize that it looks a bit tacky and ordinary when I had thought the outfit would look slinky and good. I'm a bit disappointed, but can't see anything better. I wander back slowly, getting distracted. I am a bit arrogant and uppity. Other people are all excited and enthusiastic about the play coming up. (186 words)

A Native American man is nearby. I am working hard, resenting the work and feeling overwhelmed. I am doing the dishes and trying to organize piles of papers. He says to me lovingly, "I'll do the dishes for you. It's all right." I feel guilty and relieved. He assures me it is no problem. He would love to help me. I uneasily let him. I now try to straighten the papers. He says he will do that too. I then start to dance around in a circle, slowly at first and then with more pep and fun. I like the dance. So does a small dog, maybe a Terrier, who leaps into my arms on one of my dramatic twirls. It looks so cute and the Native American watches lovingly, happy to see me happy. I do it again, with the dog, just to feel the endearing smile of the man. Now I see another man, actually a suit of clothes all folded up, only a thin, ill man is in it. I pick him up gently and hold him. I have great empathy for him and his pain. I smile tenderly and say, "I understand how hard it is and how beautiful it is when you can reach that moment when you can love the pain and yourself. It is a rare moment and hard to get to. But it is ecstatic when you get there." (237 words)

I apparently now live in a very large house, but only use a couple of the rooms. My cousin says to me, "Perhaps you will take in Deirdre. She could live with you." I feel the woman's need to better the situation of her child. I look into the bright green eyes of the child (perhaps middle school or early high school age). I say, smiling, "I'd love to have a child with green eyes and green hair." It is really blonde hair but she has a huge green hair ribbon on. Those eyes are an illuminous bright green, a very unusual color for eyes. She is happy. I tell her she has to fit into the routine and get up at this hour and do this and that and then we'll all get along well. I think it will be more work, with the baby I already have, but it will be OK. I wonder if she will go to W. High School. Now the scene shifts and I am talking to the principal, a tall, large man. I am investigating what seems to be a racial discrimination situation. I am a journalist in attitude. At first the principal is hostile and defensive. I guess he thinks I am accusing him. I keep interviewing people and the focus shifts bigger and bigger until the principal says, "Ah, I see. You are now looking at Universal Peace, not just a discrimination thing for one person." He relaxes and is helpful. (250 words)

Lucy and I are together. I realize I've been skipping classes again and will get yet another term's worth of failing grades and "Y"'s or incompletes. I feel like a failure. Lucy asks me if I've talked with Dr. Roy. I then start drinking out of a small baby bottle; I am sucking water. I kind of feel some satisfaction reverting to baby, but a woman disapproves very much, at me, a grown woman behaving like a baby. I feel a bit guilty. (83 words)

I am in a house. Charla is being naughty and noisy and I tell her she has to take a nap. I pick her up and put her on the bed and she wriggles around. I give her a small swat on the butt and say she has to stay there and I'll know if she sneaks out. I leave the room. Several women are there in the house and they are uppity, high class women who disapprove of Charla's behaviors, and they disapprove of me. They follow me around being snotty. Now I am in an acting class and they are in the same class. Everyone looks down at me and laughs openly at me. I take it in stride, not getting angry. I am a bit frustrated, but I laugh at them being so silly. They hate that. I tell them quite bluntly and firmly I don't like their attitudes and behaviors. I am matter of fact. They get very angry at me and are vengeful. The man I am to act with takes on their attitude and is sneering at me. I look up at his face, all deformed with a glass milky white eye. I say to him, "You are very ugly." He lunges at me, supposedly acting and I side step and move away. A woman comes near me and I jump, like I'm going to defend myself from her physically. I have a pair of scissors in my hand I hold like a weapon. I feel a bit embarrassed because she isn't attacking me. (260 words)

Now I am in a very ritzy house. The kittens, three of them, and a puppy, all want out and I go to open the door. They had been cooped up in the house too long and need to pee. But as soon as they get out the door on the porch, they want back in. I won't let them back in. Now more uppity rich women come to the door and tell me Mrs. Baxter wants to talk to me. Then they leave. I smile and agree to visit Mrs. Baxter, even though I know they all hate me and it cost them dearly to even speak to me. I now walk down the sidewalk and am in awe of all the very rich houses, very colorful. I gawk like a tourist. I can't find Mrs. Baxter and keep walking. I ask a woman does she know where Mrs. B. lives and the woman says yes she does. I then ask if she will tell me. She thinks, smiles and says no, she won't. I hear a group of women, who have been following me, laughing at me. I know this is a stupid joke they are pulling on me, but again I am not angry, but choosing to do what I want to do, which is see these beautiful homes. I come to the end of the land and see the beautiful vast sea. It's a resort area. I'm on a promontory point and I look down and see huge mansions and the ocean beyond. I look back to my left and see people sliding and playing in a frothy surf waterfall kind of thing. When I look down, I feel dizzy and vertigo. The woman are laughing very loudly and applauding my "stupidity." I walk back toward the house, still deliberately ignoring the women and seeing the sights. I see one house where a woman sits on a blue couch and chair set outside of her house. (330 words)

It is Victorian times. I am one of four sisters who are having trouble getting a marriage partner. I find myself walking up a mountain road to a resort that is for people to meet future mates. The driveways are unfinished and only partially paved. There is rough dirt and gravel. I wonder why I chose such a low class (middle class) place to go to. I feel a bit embarrassed and ashamed I have to do this. I see the name of the hotel on the porch. Something Bachelor Beau____. I look again trying to commit the name to memory. The word "sin" is there followed by a goose and a gander, wooden carved thing. I chuckle at the reference to the sexes. I enter the main living room. I see several older gray-haired gentlemen and my heart sinks. A blind man, more my age, says to me cynically, "Are you here to get a rich husband?" I say, "No I am not." A door opens and several other men come in, one couple obviously gay. They are dressed in modern clothes. I am in a full length satin Victorian dress. I think to myself, "I would like this to be Victorian and I don't want the gay couple there." I am taken upstairs by a plumb maid. I don't want to be here. Now one of my sisters is here. We are both trying to get a husband, only we kept this secret from each other and both choose to be at this hotel. She is annoyed to find me there. We are to go down to dinner. We barely speak. At the dinner table is a sinister, black-haired typical villain of romance novels. He wants me. I despise him. He sits next to Lydia at the opposite end of the table. I now leave the dinner and go out for a stroll. He follows me and presses his suit. I am repelled and faint. He picks me up and carries me back to the hotel. My hero, William Shattner, is coming up the drive and sees me being carried by the villain. He, William, says, "What's this?" I am taken into a room to be examined by a doctor, but my spirit stays in the waiting/living room seated on a couch with the villain seated on my right. William gets on bended knee and is trying to hold my hand. I try to resist, but tenderly keep my hand in his. He leans forward to kiss me. I permit it without returning the kiss and then my feelings overtake me and I kiss him. He now knows I love him. I say to him, "I (meaning the sleeping me in the other room) won't remember this." William says, "But I will," meaning he will continue to pursue me, knowing now there is a chance. The villain's lips twitch. He is very unhappy. (485 words)

I am back with Howard. He is sweet and caring and young. So am I (young). We have a baby and Howard is the main caretaker. He brings the baby to me. The baby has short, stubby legs with thick thighs. I look at his feet and say, "Oh he will grow up tall and strong. He has big feet." Then the baby gets up and walks around a bit. I am amazed. He is a newborn. Then he begins to talk. He tells me he has listened in to my thoughts. He is gentle, loving and an alien baby of some sort. I am very impressed and we bond. He is helping me. He gives me advice. I realize Howard and I haven't been sleeping together and having sex for years. I want to start that part of our relationship, willingly and with joy. Now there's a crowd of people and I am dressed very pretty. I've lost weight and another woman, a movie star, is trying to take the attention of the crowd. With the baby's telepathic support, I step into the center and charmingly take the admiration of the crowd, mostly the men. There is a bunch of FBI bodyguard type men there. Howard and the baby and I are going somewhere. (215 words)

He laughs at me and continues teasing me. I begin to dump out his pockets and so on, making a terrible mess. I am furious and self-righteous. He begins to like me and continues teasing me. I bolt from the place, now naked and stoned or drunk. I cross the freeway, not even looking to see if I'll get hit by the cars. I go down a bike path near the river. Dana jumps in the river and swims to try and follow me. I go into some restaurant and see a woman who is the manager. I remember I tried to be a manager once and didn't do a good job of it. This woman with exposed breasts is doing a fine job. Dana is there, loving me. I ignore him. (172 words)

I and another woman are entering a big auditorium. We want to get good seats so we can see the events on the stage and meet in the back with our small group easily. It will be very crowded soon, we know, because we went through this before. I go to the left rear side and get a folding chair and then decide to go to the right rear side as that's where the small group will meet, but the athletic team has reserved most of the seats in the back and so I change my mind again and go to the left rear side to find all the places are almost taken and finally decide on the aisle. The ceremonies are starting and I lean way over to see. It is Rosalie, the Mayor of E City doing a discussion or speech and she's written "Rosalie" on the blackboard. It's just one word, her own name. I laugh and share this with a woman next to me. Then a male actor comes in and waits his moment. As he gets up to take a leather bag up the aisle shouting his lines, I realize the fingers of my left hand are caught in the straps and I am running up the aisle behind him, desperately trying to get my fingers out. I am wearing a bridal gown and veil. I finally get unstuck and go back and sit down. I tell the woman how embarrassed I am, how conspicuous I was. [BL] (252 words)

I am watching as a disembodied observer. I see an old lady on a motorcycle. She refuses to put hub caps on her back wheels. She wants the spokes exposed. She wears leather and is feisty and independent. However, she decides she wants a job. She offers to be a delivery person for messages. She is hired, but as she takes the leather message pouch and lays it on the back wheel, the employer insists she cover the spokes with a hub cap. It annoys her a bit, but she complies because she thinks the job will be fun and she can see the sense of it. After all, it would not be safe to let the bag get caught up in the spokes when she's driving. So she takes the pouch with the papers inside to her destination. When she gets there, there are forms to fill out and she has lots of difficulty getting this done. (158 words)

We drift over to the west toward the ocean and barely make it, now landing safely on the beach. How very nice - we can camp here. We land. I see a restroom right in front of the spot we decide to rest at. How convenient, but will it block our view of the beautiful ocean? I look over around to the right sand we can see the ocean, calm but also coming right up to our edge of the camp. I think to myself, "Sure hope this is already high tide or that the calm conditions keep up or we'll not be safe here." We decide to stay. (148 words)

I am at a house, possibly my "mom's" house, and a combination party is happening. One group of people is my relatives and another group is my disabled friends. I go from one room to another, mingling and chatting. In the relative room, my mother, who is fairly young and pretty, and I tap dance together. Everybody likes that. We have fun. Then I go to the room with my disabled friends and we talk. Rochelle questions me critically. I made a statement and she'd say, "Did you actually use the masculine pronoun?" I just looked at her and said, "Yes, I did" (not politically correct, you know). Now a woman is going up on stage to sing a song with a big name rock band. I am her sister or friend and am asked to come on up and join in. So now there are four to six men from the rock group, "Heads and Roses," mostly drummers, and her and me. She sings and I add some harmony. The song is about "I love you Dad." Dad (not my real one) is out in the audience. Even though she is the star, I manage to get the last line in with excellent harmony and everyone is pleased. (209 words)

I am at some office building, maybe the newspaper. I meet Mark H and a man and we are talking. They show me a newspaper clipping from years ago about me and all the good works I am doing in the disabled community. Mark is gentle and sweet but somewhat distant. I tell him congratulations for getting the handicapped coordinator job at the community college and tell him I used to be that. I tell him he can call on me any time if he needs help or has questions. I do that to leave an opening so we could get together, if he wanted. Now I am at home. Mark and his sister and his cat come to visit. We all chat. Mark is shy, but seems to like me. I like him too. I hold his cat and the cat is loving and cuddles gently in my arms. It's as though I am holding him (Mark). This is a good sign. This means the cat, who is fussy, likes me a lot. This is important to Mark and his sister. Now they are leaving and I walk them out to the porch. Only now Mark is seated, semi laying down on a porch seat. I sit down near him and we talk. I look past him and see a huge river with lots of people playing and swimming. He asks me to describe the scene to him. I tell him it is a pleasant Sunday afternoon where people are all out to enjoy the wonderful weather and have fun. I tell him about four fat men who each stand ten feet apart and at a signal all fall in backwards into the river; the kids swimming and playing. A sled that looks like a snow sleigh goes by, with red painted trim. I describe that. A convertible car with no engine or hood in the front goes by, crawling over the couches near the bank. The driver is concerned that water is splashing into the empty place where the engine would be. He wants his spiffy car to stay spiffy. I say to him, "I'm sorry," thinking I helped splash some water. Then I say to Mark, "I'm always telling people I'm sorry." Mark and I are getting physically closer, our arms brushing each other. It is gentle and loving and shy. We are very attracted to each other. Mark tells me of his house, which is his but it's his mother's and his family is very important to him. Then I notice the river level is dropping. All of a sudden, the entire water contents of the river drain away and everyone falls to the bottom, including us. A man tells us that the water will be gone for one or two hours. I look up and see the man on a high balcony by a metal railing. The sun is warm and bright. I am looking up at him but aware I am shyly avoiding looking into Mark's eyes. I have Mark, a quad, folded up in my arms and I stand up and start walking, carrying him. The way is rough, stones, debris and boulders. It makes walking hard, but I am managing well. I get back up near the house and Mark says, "My brother left a taped message in your van for you." I laugh and say, "Then let's go hear it." We go back toward the van. (575 words)

Jake and I are traveling together. We stop at a motel. Jake is going to a conference. Some weird old lady who runs the motel chats with us. He looks at his brochure. Jake is very happy about the low cost and the great fun things he'll get to do at his conference. I seem to be along for the ride. The old lady shows us to our room and as she is still there. Several other people sort of wander through. A man on a bicycle cart that has video taped movies on it backs into the room. I go over and look for a good movie to watch. It would be fun to rent one, but they all seem to be boring or old titles and I can't find any I would be willing to watch. I say to Jake maybe he'd want to watch one of the old sci-fi ones. Jake says no. I notice he has blank write-in books there and say, "Oh, I have plenty." He leaves. Several other people come in through another door like they'd just come downstairs. Now the lady says something about the river in the back. I want to see the view. I go to the window and look out. I think I see the river and then I see it is just the highway. I look across the highway and finally see a pretty waterfall further down on the right. Then I realize the river is right in front of me, across the highway. I feel a bit foolish at not seeing it right away. Now the old lady wants to show me something and we see an odd elevator that has build in cubby holes where books and so on are kept like in display in a store. It goes up, so that a series of these displays are run past me. I see some ink pens and she says I can choose one. I try a couple of them and find one that writes in thick black strokes. I like that one a lot. I choose a pretty blue one and then she offers that I can have one of each color. I take the purple one also. (371 words)

There are wild mustang horses and I and some man are catching them and riding them. They have cartoon-looking eyes and each one has a sign held up or somehow on their faces below their eyes. The signs are pieces of large white paper with words on them. Now we are doing a documentary on the Wild West or cattle drives or something. We interview cowboys and then three Indians come by and I approach them to ask for an interview. I say, "I know we whites took your land and you have no trust of me, but I'd like to hear what you have to say." One takes an interest in me (I am a young, pretty woman with long black hair), He agrees to talk. Now the other man I'm with is the owner of a cattle herd and ranch and is doing a cattle drive. I decide at the last moment to tag along to help. I grab a horse, a blanket with a space blanket inside and some beef jerky kinds of food and gallop after them. This infuriates the man who chooses to ignore me or help me. If I freeze or starve, then fine. I follow along doggedly. At the ranch house, his mother says to me, "Make him talk to you. Then maybe he'll stop being so cruel and stupid." I laugh and say, "If I could, I would." He is adamant. Some other woman wants to help me and finds four umbrellas and ties them to my saddle bags. I say, "How will these help me? I'll take them if you can convince me they will be helpful." The woman tries to think of a way they can be helpful and says they would make paper sounds when opened and this may scare the cattle into moving, or scare away predators. I am not convinced. I ride out of the house to catch up with the man on the cattle drive. (329 words)

I am seated on the right end of a couch. I feel tired. I notice a cobweb right in front of me with two spiders on it, which gives me the creeps. I inch my way over to the left side and start to get up. I say something and a man seated at a table just to the left is furious and angry with me. He tirades on about how filthy and lazy I am. A woman sits to his left at the table, and I look first at the man and then at the woman in shock at this tremendous outburst. I turn to my "father" also at the table and I say, "Does he mean I don't bathe often enough and I stink, or does he mean I don't change my clothes often enough?" My "father," who is a stocky short man with thick dark hair and tired bags under his eyes, gets up and walks to me and kneels in front of me. (He looks like an older, tired Deepak Chopra.) He says, "I love being around you best when you..." and he gestures with his hand like he is wiping away tears. I'm not crying, but I do feel put upon and sad. Emotional, at any rate. Then he puts his head on my knees, rather than in my lap, and I have to reach a long ways to smoothe and caress his hair, which I do. I say, "I just don't understand." He says, "Ira Nah-nah," and looks at me knowingly, like I should get it. (262 words)

I am in a church community room and a group of church members are there. I have led them to believe that I am dying and they are having a ceremony for me. It is their tradition to gather in a semi-circle around the injured or dying person. Each member offers a gift and connects with the one who is dying in very touching, loving ways. The woman explaining uses the following example: "If a dying person wants to be treated like a queen, then someone might bring them a robe and drape it over them and bow and treat them like a queen." So, first the group stands in the front of the room and sings "Oh, Come all Ye Faithful." I stand in front of them, singing with them. I am deeply moved and near tears as I sing with them. The song is beautiful and I haven't sung for a long time, what with my throat difficulties. I am feeling very guilty for accepting all this outpouring of love on false pretenses, since I am not dying. Ellie is there sitting to my left. She looks at me, knowing I am cheating.

I am up all night with some people. I am tired. Ellie calls me up. She's had some premonition about me dying. Possibly Aunt Millie is around and we talk about it. Then a man friend named Richard comes over. He is heartbroken. He's in love with a woman who won't have him. I am supportive. Richard goes to see his Doctor and I go with him. It is 3:00 am and as Richard talks to the good-looking doctor (like Deepak Chopra in looks), people come to the door, one at a time and hand him handwritten notes. He pauses, reads them, smiles appreciatively at them and continues with Richard. One of those people is a young, frail teenage runaway girl. She has a crush on him. He is gentle with her. The doctor now asks me out for a dinner date. I smile and say yes. I like him and he likes me. The next night I come to his office. I am dressed in a sexy black dress. I am young and good-looking with a trim, firm figure, and I am wearing a coat, like a trench coat, over it. I want to dazzle him later with the surprise of how nice I look. He says, "The car is over here." I look and see a tiny black sports car. It is very spiffy, but as we get to it, it is filled with rusty brown water. The top is down and perhaps it rained. I don't really care one way or the other. He is watching for my reaction. Then he says he has another car and opens a garage-like door. It is up a few feet (maybe 4 or 5 feet) from the ground level and covered with a car protection tarp. He unties the tarp and removes it and the car goes backwards like down a ramp and stops next to me. It is a plain brown station wagon. I cheerfully open the passenger side door and see three plants with red flowers on the floor on the passenger side and some cardboard boxes. While I am chatting with the doctor, I move the cardboard boxes to the back seat, asking his permission first, to clear a space for me to sit. He seems pleased that I take all this in pleasant nonchalance. Now he's driving and I am seated to his right and slowly we inch closer together. I'm still in my coat. Now we are close. I say, "I used to live in cities but I don't like cities. I love small towns." He agrees. He loves small towns also. He says, "There's hardly any more places left on earth that don't have a road coming to them." I turn my face toward him and his face is so close, I kiss his cheek tenderly. He smiles lovingly. We arrive somewhere and discover that my friend Richard has been arrested by some military man. Richard had fallen madly in love with another woman who is no good for him. I want to rescue Richard, so I approach the military officer and take my coat off slowly. The doctor is behind me so as I slowly drop my coat, the military man sees the front and the doctor sees the back. They are both mesmerized by my beauty. I have sufficiently distracted the military man and Richard runs for the small row boat. The doctor and I follow and the three of us shove out into this huge lake. I notice the tip of a brown creature's nose peeking out of the waves and feel a second of concern that it is a monster. We continue on. It is a bit difficult as the small boat bobbles in the waves.

I am afraid of this young boy, young teen, maybe 12. He is going to hurt people, me included. I run from him, trying to block his route behind me. I am now in a house, with some other people -- a woman, a girl child and a nice man. I call the police. The boy is systematically eliminating each person. I dial 911 and calmly, but scared, tell them my name and address and this boy is killing everyone and he's after me. They must come at once. He's eliminated the woman, then the girl, and now he's got the man. I am still on the phone saying, "If you don't come now, it will be too late." He turns off the TV and is approaching me. I bolt for the door, even though I know my best chance is to stay in the house until the police get there, but now it seems my only chance is to get away from him. I run. I am now at a lake or river with murky water. I am in the water and there is a fence to my left, dividing the water. I grab it with my hand. It is an electric fence and sharp jags of electricity play on it and jolt me. Then I (the dreamer) decide that no one would put an electrified fence over water. It would be too dangerous. I see the raft the boy made. It is a single log, tied at both ends with rope and the two other ends of the ropes are tied together at a docking like of thing. This makes a triangular shape of the log and the ropes. He yells at me angrily, "No girl can touch my boat." He comes for me. He dives into the murky water and I use the log as a pole to keep him from me, and then as he bites my toe, attempting to bite it off, I use the pole to beat at him, trying to kill him before he gets me. I am afraid. He's got me and is gnawing through my toe. The pain is excruciating. I am screaming, "Help, Help!" to get the police to know this is where I am. Then I scream V, so they know it's me, the one who made the emergency 911 call. I wake up. (395 words)

Sharon L is teaching me to play a saxophone. At first I am terrible, with squeaks and noises, but with constant practice, I become very good. I am a man and on a stage. The audience is sparse and not too interested, but as I practice, the audience gets bigger and more interested. I decide to do a comedy act with the sax. The stage is very high. I see a paper with an article about 5th and 6th grade students and how as an audience they are disdainful and rude. They wander around and ignore and make noises talking among themselves. By now I am quite good and the audience is thick and attentive but very far away, and the stage is so very high. Now I have an orchestra of sorts with maybe five violins. I decide to expand and play the blues fiddle as well. I see Curtis Salgodo in the crowd and ask him to join me onstage playing the cello. We improvise. The music is very good. I'm thinking of learning the blues harp as well. Now the audience is also on the stage in raised seating behind me. I have only a narrow strip of stage to work on. I nearly fall off the front of the stage and get a dizzy sense of vertigo whenever I get close to the edge of the stage. I'm playing well and the audience is attentive, but distant. (241 words)

I am a woman who is being terrorized by a man who takes a medicine and is invisible. He grabs the steering wheel of the car I'm driving and tries to crash us and so on. I flee. Now I am a man and the same invisible man is after me. It is a life and death situation. I suspect my psychiatrist. I go into his office to see if I can find evidence. He comes in and I hide in his closet. a roomy coat closet. He comes in and I hide behind coats. He says to me, "I can smell you. I know you're here." He tries to feel me but barely misses me. He leaves. Now I've driven up to my own cabin or house. I sing opera and a rock group wants me to sing with their band, blending the two forms of music. The invisible man comes. There are lots of people in the room and I fire my pistol into the invisible man many times. Everyone thinks I've gone crazy and I ask them to leave. The supposedly dead, invisible man lays under my pool table. I feel for a pulse; he is still alive and I shoot many more bullets into him. Finally he is dead. Then a second invisible man is after me. I fight him too. It is terrorizing a nightmare. (230 words)

I am F. Hayward and John Wayne and I are very attracted to each other. We want to be touching and physically close all the time. Meanwhile I have a difficult boss. I am about to be fired. I work hard and I feel bad. "This is the second job where I got fired unjustly," I say to the snooty secretary. I want to explain my side to the boss. Now somehow I've created or am creating a movie. The boss is now the director or producer. He comes in and I tell him in a firm tone that he will ruin everything if he continues to use that authoritarian voice and lectures at the crew all the time. He must learn to listen, listen, listen well. John Wayne is standing by me ready to defend me or protect me. Now I look out the window and I see men swimming toward the very ritzy mansion I live in. I see a sailing boat, only it seems to be metal, like "Old Ironsides" with red running lights. I am the isolated hostess throwing a party for the people who have rejected me. I hope they will come. But I'm not sure they understood my side of the story. I wait, hopefully. Now these men are coming to the party to help back me up. I am pleased. The night is dark and the waters are dark. John Wayne had gone out and convinced them of my innocence. Now I see two women in evening dress approaching my front steps. They are hesitant, unsure if they should trust me. I encourage them to come in. Now the people come and we have a wonderful, happy party with dancing and music. I am wearing a beautiful flowing evening dress, of a 1940's or 50's vintage. John Wayne and I dance in anticipation of being alone to make wonderful passionate love. I am exonerated. (321 words)

I am traveling. I have borrowed Aunt Rosalie's car, a Thunderbird, 1979. It is a big Cadillac-like car, very powerful. I have some trouble managing the steering because it is so very sensitive and responsive to the slightest touch. I keep moving suddenly toward the other lane. The trunk has a special device to load heavy luggage and I use it for my power wheelchair. I think happily that I could get me one of these and then have the fun of a sweet fast car and be able to take my wheelchair. I stop now and am in a room with a piano, a black, shiny grand piano. I am auditioning for a very important director. I sing a blues or jazz like Ella Fitzgerald or some excellent singer. A star, an excellent singer, is also singing. We do a duet for part of the song. I sing well and with power. Then the song is over and I go over where some friends, or maybe strangers, are. One of them asks me what happened in one section of the song where I seemed to have no energy, or I was depressed. They were very serious and asked me if it was because the other woman and I were talking and the other woman confided in me that she can't have children. Did that mess up our timing because we got so depressed? I say, "No not at all. Sure we talked and it was sad. But what messed up my timing was the fact that I was so scared and in awe of the caliber of talent at this convention or contest." Really fine musicians are here and I was afraid they'd laugh at me or wonder how I even got into the contest, I was so inferior. The other chuckled that I can't even see my own talent, because it is obvious to them that I am comparable to the others. (324 words)

I have a questionnaire and I need three women and three men to answer it for me. I am on a bus and the door is open. A swarming crowd of revelers are all around. I watch as a man with a blue face lies on the sidewalk and tells the woman he's with that he loves her. I chuckle because it is obvious they are strangers and the man is horny. I try to ask several men to fill out the questionnaire. They are too rushed and busy. One hesitates and I kindly assure him he can go on, I can find someone else. Now the bus accidentally got caught in the Rose Parade. The marchers are a bit annoyed at us and we try to drive out of the way and park in a parking lot. We see a man who is very angry at a policeman for reprimanding him and he is angrily smashing the policeman's car to bits. Now I am in a huge house, perhaps a mansion. I am worried about Charla. A woman has lured her away and has taken her into one of the rooms and is molesting her. I see an image of Charla with her vagina exposed. I race from room to room opening doors and looking. I hear Charla calling off in the distance. Maybe she's on the third floor. I keep looking, worried. [BL] (234 words)

I am busy doing things and then Archie comes up to me. I think we are outdoors walking down a sidewalk. He hugs me enthusiastically and twirls me around so strongly my feet leave the ground and I am flying perpendicular to the ground. He reminds me that the dance performances are tonight (Tuesday) and hopes to see me there. I had forgotten and there was something else I planned to do that night. So I readjust and fit it into my plans. I go to the building and wander around the halls until I find the right room. I notice I am now wearing my old bikini style swimsuit. My legs and stomach are thin and nice-looking but my breasts are quite huge and the top of the swimsuit is partly undone and the breasts keep sort of falling out under the halter top. I keep trying to fix it so I'm not so exposed. I go in and people are preparing their individual spaces and props for their performance. I look around to find the right spot to put mine. I choose one place and then decide it's too much in the way of traffic and move it to another area. I lay out a couple of bunches of bananas in an artful way and hope no one comes along and takes a banana to eat; it will ruin the composition I made. Now I leave to go back and do what I had already planned, intending to return in time to do the performance. Now I can't find the van. I can't remember where I parked it. I am outside in the parking lot. I see what might be my van, but it turns out to be a station wagon with some hippie man on the top with all his wares spread out. I am relieved it isn't my van. I thought he was on my van. I see another vehicle, but it turns out not to be my van. I now am worried and annoyed with myself for not paying more attention to where I parked it. I go down a city street. No van. (359 words)

I am moving to an old house with odd rooms that spread out all over. Dwight/Howard is going to help me. Lucy and two babies are there. I am holding one and she is holding the other. We are trying to get them to nap as I walk around trying to think and organize how to manage this huge task. Finally, I get the baby to sleep. I open a door and it is a small bathroom. Really, only a bathtub is in it. I look at the kitchen, which has two or three wooden oak tables (dining room type) hanging way up on the wall for counter space. That will be awkward. Dwight/Howard comes in and I am frustrated trying to get his attention. He finally listens to my ideas but sighs and says, "It won't work. We made a mistake buying this rambling house and a mistake moving to M City. We belong back in the valley, so let's not take such care where things go and only unpack the essentials until we can move again." He then suggests we be friends again. I say, "No way." Now I kind of give up and sit on the couch with an older woman. I make a snide remark about how she can't work either because she's so old, and I can't work, cause I'm so old too. It's a sort of frustrated joke. Nothing seems to be going right. No one is helping. [BL] (244 words)

Some man and I have a huge brick house like an old mansion. I am making a landscape plan and trying to decide where to put the new trees and where to put the flower garden.

But a terrible storm is brewing. All the neighbors are leaving the neighborhood because the big beautiful trees are going to fall down and it is dangerous. We decide to stay and weather it out in our strong house. We go in and now others are with us. We go up to the top floor. One woman goes out on a balcony and nearly falls over the edge. I warn everybody to be careful because the marble and the stones are slippery. Meanwhile I am aware that there are spirits and ghosts there. One may have pushed the woman who nearly went over the edge. Ellie says her mother and father-in-law were there, in spirit form because they were dead. I feel scared. (196 words)

I have hired two men to work as my personal assistants while I am in class. One is Paul (from acting class) and one is a Chicano man. I come in late and fuss with my stuff and don't pay much attention to the teacher. Then Paul comes over. He is angry at me. He says I don't want to work with you any more. You're not really interested in the classes, you only want the attention. I am offended and uppity. I say, "I don't care if he quits, I hardly use him anyway. I do things myself." He walks away, but hangs around watching me in disapproval. Meanwhile I ask the Chicano man to do something and I realize I haven't bothered to pay him for weeks. I try to figure out how much I owe him. I hadn't really used his services for a long time but I did keep him on the payroll. So I write a check for $45, after deliberating if I should given him the third week, since I couldn't remember how long it was since I paid him. I decide to do the right thing and guess on the generous side. He is happy and Paul is impressed that I still have some humane values left.

I am at Ginny's house, only I've never seen this house. It's big and nice, but configured all wrong for her real house. Ginny is throwing some special dinner party because I'd had some kind of experience with some people and she wanted to celebrate it. It's her way of being involved, only everything went wrong. She set up computer monitors at each table and each table had a "field" sign which indicated which people would sit at that table. I sit at one table which is more like a TV tray and start to eat, but she says I'm at the wrong table. I'm kind of glad because I don't like the people at that table. I look around for some people I would like to be around. She hands me a postcard from a mutual friend and I read it, sitting on the couch next to her. All the other guests are milling around, unsure of when things start and what to do. Ginny is confused and keeps saying it's ready and then it doesn't happen. The people at the party are odd. There's a young boy who annoyed me and his father who defends him; a young princess-like woman who is totally selfish and her mother that defends her; a deaf woman and Jackie McC and her husband. I am now in a small adjoining room with the mother and daughter. The daughter is very upset because her lovely evening gown has a big hole in it. I had watched the deaf woman using water to wash that spot and it shrunk up the material. The mother is irate. I tell them to their faces I don't like them and their attitudes. They are very upset with me. Then I see Jackie falling and hurting her head and laying down on a couch and her husband all concerned. I say to the mother, "That Jackie, always an actress." I then barge in to do a funny bit. I pretend to be a helpful, concerned person and end up making her very miserable. I stand over her and insist she drink this milk concoction which I force down her throat. She does, but she spills it back up. I see it coming and do a "funny" routine about, "Are you going to.. no, you wouldn't. You wouldn't dare...Oh, you did." I feel a bit uncertain, because I begin to realize she really is hurt and wasn't acting and I've just made it worse. Just like Ginny made a bad situation worse with her intense attempt to be included. Ernie is there and I look out a back window and see the garage floor down maybe a full story. I say, "Wow, that's a long drop" and feel vertigo. I back away from the edge. (466 words)

I am watching as a bus comes around the corner of the house I'm in. A friend and neighbor, a man is driving the bus for kicks and the dark-haired woman driver is standing near the door laughing. It's all a good time joke. I laugh. Now I walk down the sidewalk to the woman's house. I buy a lace beige dress for $17. I am now eating oatmeal and drop a hot blob of it on my lap. It melts a big hole in the lace pattern. I am very surprised. I say to the woman, who is now playfully in the lap of the man, who I like, "I guess I'll have to ask for my money back." I don't want us to quarrel about this since my man friend seems to like her so much. I also feel a bit sad or jealous it is her and not me. She says quietly, "No, I don't give refunds." I am a bit annoyed, but still want us to be on friendly terms. I say, "Are you saying this happens to all the dresses like this? Because if it only happened to mine, then I have a defective dress and should be refunded. If it is all the dresses, then you sell defective merchandise and I should be refunded. Maybe I'll go find a lawyer and talk to him about my rights." She agrees to refund me. (238 words)

Some airplane wreck happened and one man is injured and another big plump man and I are in a room with the injured man. Richard, the big man, is the investigator and I am helping. The airline representative keeps coming in to Richard and saying, "The airline says they will give you _____" and Richard laughs and says, "Not good enough." While we wait for her to return, Richard and I playfully tease each other and talk. I tell him how my hair is all ruined now because I accidentally cut the bangs funny. Now I can't sing the blues right. He creates a poster that basically says that I am psychologically injured over my appearance being ruined. I think that's a bit much, but I seriously tell him how people think this is just a small thing, but it is really affecting my life in a big way. Richard is empathetic. We are annoyed that the airlines has put us in the very back room, behind the gymnasium, and there's even open doorways that lead out to other rooms where they are rented out for weddings. I see some bridesmaids lined up in the hall. So Richard and I go out for a walk and get outside. We lie down on the sidewalk near the grass. We're sort of in a wagon. I am holding a newborn baby. She is really cute and I enjoy her. But Richard is starting to want to get close and amorous. He puts her down by my feet in a small corner. I look to make sure she can still breathe there. She is fine. Then a man comes over, obviously an old friend of Richard's. He hugs Richard and kisses him and Richard laughs and says, "Hey, don't. She'll get the wrong idea." The man is pretending to be amorphous to tease Richard. I look at his hair. It's a bit messy, graying and balding, but he sure could sing the blues. I am impressed and he walks away singing the blues. Now I have the sweet baby girl in my arms and I am driving my wheelchair around the lawn, avoiding running over people laying on the grass and enjoying the ride with the baby. (374 words)

I am in a small town with Patricia and Charla. There is going to be a parade and a turkey roundup. We are walking down the street trying to find the best place to see the turkey roundup. We pass many people lined up on the streets to watch the parade. Finally we realize we've gone too far. I do see a place behind us that has music and big klieg lights. I figure that must be the place. We walk back to that place and see several circles of people dancing in bright and colorful costumes, but no turkeys. Now we go up some stairs into a building and find children in a circle to do the kid turkey roundup. We see the kids trying to catch baby turkeys. Charla goes into the circle. I see a turkey chick (which looks pretty much like an eagle or owl) on the back shoulder of a boy. Now Charla has her turkey and we decide to head back home, only now we are flying in a plastic laundry basket. We are looking at this new city called Yamhill which is all manmade. Patricia is saying that it is a shame that underneath all this beauty and modern convenience are debris and decay. Hidden beneath the pretty buildings and the manmade lakes are piles of rubbish. I nearly fall out of the basket several times as we fly over the city. (239 words)

She is trying to talk to me and then starts repeating her words, like she's caught in a do-loop where she starts a sentence and can't finish it so she goes back and tries again. The husband cautions us not to interrupt her because that makes it worse. I have seated myself so I am near the aisle so I can wheelchair out if I need to. But as more people arrive, that aisle is filled up. I am given a huge syringe with a long needle. I watch another woman as she stabs herself with it and injects the healing fluid (which looks like water). I try it and make a stab at my leg. It goes through the muscle and out the other side (through the skin, really). The fluid leaks out I try and save it. (166 words)

I am piloting a plane, a fighter jet. I am flying low over the most beautiful terrain -- blue waters, deep canyons, mountains. I struggle to keep the nose up so I don't hit rough rocks and mountain jags. The terrain becomes rough and barren. I decide I prefer the more beautiful stuff and it shifts. Now I notice I am nearly out of gas. Apparently I was so enthralled with the flying and the beauty I neglected to notice the status of my fuel. I am embarrassed and concerned. I radio in a help call. An airport nearby answers. Then I run out of gas and have to try and hang glide in without power. It is a difficult struggle, but I manage it well. I land relatively safe, with the nose of the plane up against the back wall. There are some dents, but it is all in all intact. I am proud of my flying and others come over, also impressed.

I am going down a street and see Archie, who is very sad. He is growing older and has a disability, a limp or something. He can't do his dance as he has before. I point out I know what that's like. I try and be sympathetic with him. I am interrupted by a woman who works for Lori and Dan T. She asks me to come to the office. I tell Archie to wait and I go into an office room. Lori is there, rather upset with me, and hands me a paper. I feel trapped and don't want to deal with this face to face, but now that I am here, let's get it over with. The paper is a bill for a phone call made by a Mr. Nelson for $48. She wants me to pay it. I hesitate and then get clear. "No," I say, "I will not pay this bill. It is not my bill. And furthermore I am very unhappy that you billed me for the carpet. I will not pay for that. In fact, I am expecting you to reimburse me my prorated rent and my security deposit." She becomes very upset and dramatically says to her woman assistant she cannot listen to any more of this. Her face is contorted in over-dramatic nerves. I am aware of Archie waiting for me across the street. I feel compelled to try and get to him, before he gets upset and leaves. I am caught in the middle again. [BL] (254 words)

I am with some people. The men are selfish and rude. They get ahead of me and create a wooden sidewalk to where they want to go and it blocks my access. I ask them, "What about me?" They pay no attention. Now they are pushy and hurtful. I go into a house and find a man on a bed with blood all over him. He is very badly injured. I ask him if he needs me to call 911. He can't speak because of the pain, but nods his head yes. I try to find a phone. Finally, I have had enough. Those harassing men are after me. I had been trying to be accommodating, but now I just want them away from me. I'm tired of them hurting me. I yell at them, "Get into the boat! Get into the boat!" I shove them off and then see they have taken my purse. I demand they return it, saying, "I suppose you've taken all my money and credit cards." They arrogantly toss the purse at me. I am angry.

I and some other women are in a room. I see water pouring into the room. I get very concerned. The room will fill up soon and we will drown. We look for an escape route. I see a window. We end up in another room, only the water is following us. I look out another window and see a huge drop off. It's a well or tower area, but I look way up and see daylight. There's an open area up there. It's our only chance -- to go with the flow of water out the window and dog paddle in it until it rises up high enough to reach that light. It's like walking into death and riding it up to life. We do so and successfully make it, only to find that area of the castle is filled with men who intend to rape us. What irony! [BL] (150 words)
Barb Sanders:#2996 (08/30/96)

Nate returns. He is drunk. I am glad to see him. We begin to make love. Nate is angry and verbally abusive. I try to ignore that and stay with the sexual feelings. It's taking a long time to get to orgasm. An old woman walks in and chides Nate for his slowness. Nate stops. I am sexually frustrated. The old woman and I go to the "Hollywood" elevator to go upstairs. It is a raised seat, like a throne with a canopy over it. She and I sit on either side of the chair rather than decide who gets to sit on the throne. Somehow the sexual feelings are still there and maybe the old woman and I are going to finish it when we get upstairs. (128 words)
Barb Sanders:#2997 (08/30/96)

I am working at someplace where I work with the troubled cases. We have been given orders to move to another location. I feel tired. I am now looking for the new place. I see that it's a huge dorm or fraternity type house. I go past the eating booths. I find a sort of kitchen and then see a sign that says, "student rooms." I go in there and find long tables. I see Darryl sitting at the end of the one right by the door. I am very surprised and pleased to see him. I say, "Hi." He is happy to see me. I squat down and look up at him while he lays on his belly on the table and talks. He tells me some stuff about how he is working here now too. His face is very pimply. It is not so attractive. He looks as young as in high school, a teen. I answer his question and say, "I work with the troubled cases." He is a cook or cook's helper. It is time for him to go get the next rolling cart of food. He goes into an elevator and goes down. I wait. He comes back up. I peak in and see bologna slices on the cart. He doesn't want me to touch them. (221 words)
Barb Sanders:#2998 (09/01/96)

I am watching a man working hard, over and over trying to figure out what his dream symbols mean. I begin to have feelings of empathy and affection. In fact, I look him over and decide I wouldn't mind making love to him. I then tell him that I know what his dream symbols mean, because I dream the same ones. I tell him I am in lots of pain all the time, so the dreams where many people are hurting me and biting me is me hurting myself. I seem to be getting closer to him physically as I talk and I also become very sleepy, or I am pretending to be sleepy. It's like I'm drunk and it's kind of cute. He smiles at me and now my head is laying on his chest and we are cuddling. He says, "I love you." I say, "I know. And I love you." (153 words)
Barb Sanders:#2999 (09/01/96)

I am driving a car right behind a car that is making the road. It is the command car of the road construction crew. We are driving slow. It is hard to be patient. Finally after a long time it is made enough that we can go on. I am napping, I am tired. Now I wake up and Lydia, Caroline, and Delia are here. I now see the top of my head as if I am looking down on someone else's head. It is bald across the top part and there are big red welts, like my arthritis bumps on my elbows. I feel sick about it. I almost sense relief that I can wear wigs now and have pretty hair-dos. But I also feel bad I have to wear wigs. It's so false and uncomfortable. (137 words)

I am in a room and Archie comes in. He is wrinkled and wears half glasses perched on the end of his nose. He looks in his forties. He is annoyed with me. I think I took a class from him and he's not going to give me a passing grade. I sit over by a very huge fish tank, several hundreds of gallons big. I see some angel fish and others. Some of the fish I must have gotten from when I was married to Howard; others are newer. The water is very cloudy and murky. It hasn't been cleaned in a long time. (105 words)
Barb Sanders:#3001 (09/03/96)

I am in a room with lots of people, a classroom. A short funny guy, like on that TV Burt Reynolds's show, is the instructor. He is running around, full of high energy and talking non-stop. I am in the row chosen to do some role playing, some acting. I am given the role of being unmarried and having an important project to do (like write a book or play) and therefore I don't want to get married. I have more important things to do. He prompts me that it is my turn. I go up to the teacher's desk where another man is. We ad-lib. He says, "So are you getting married?" and I answer in my cute, feisty way, "Married!! Don't be silly. I've got these important projects to do." They love what a good actress I am. I go sit down. Now it is the next day and I pick up the newspaper. I see a huge picture of people seated, maybe in a stadium or an auditorium. I see a woman that looks a bit like me. I read the story and caption under the picture. It is about me and what a great job I did acting. I bask in the glory and tell my daughter, "Well, here's another newspaper story about me that my friends and acquaintances will see." I feel proud. (228 words)
Barb Sanders:#3002 (09/03/96)

There's the same little man as the previous dream. It's the next day. A friend of mine, like Marti S, is very upset with him. He had made some public remarks that indicate she isn't authentic or wasn't accurate. We go to his class again. I sit back in the room, wondering if he will see me and remember me. The room is very crowded. He comes in, prancing with energy. Marti raises her hand and he calls on her and she goes on and on, not making much sense, challenging him. He takes the challenge well, and appoints a row of students to help him test her and judge how she did. She says some words and he will check them out. Then he sees me and comes over by me. I see a picture of his two adorable children and his wife. He says, or I realize, that he is a wheelchair man. He loves women who are in wheelchairs. I am attracted to him, but don't want to disturb his family. He is attracted to me too. Now he is showing a film as educational evidence. I move to sit on a big double bed with a blue chenille bedspread. I walk over there, noticing I am walking pretty good. I sit. Later I feel the bed bouncing as he wiggles his way over next to me on the right side. He lays on his back, half slid off the bed, looking up at me. I see children in the movie. I wonder if they are his. I hear his voice doing the narration. (267 words)

I am in India. I am overwhelmed with all the sick people and I am trying to help heal them. A man asks me to his office to talk. He is attracted to me. He takes my hand. His hand is brown. He holds a red flower in his hand and he puts our hands together with the flower between us so that as we shake hands, the flower is crushed so that it's sweet perfume is on both of us. It is some courting ritual. I believe the man is an Indian doctor. I am distracted, with so much to do. (102 words)
Barb Sanders:#3004 (09/05/96)

I am trying to send a huge text file on the Internet to Russia. They are going to help me. But I begin to wonder if this is too big a text to be sent and if the Russians can be trusted to work with it and return it. Now, I am watching a group of women, young, who are hanging out having some kind of ritual party to get rid of the "losers" they had dated. There is some kind of container with a sign on it about the "losers." You can ritualistically put your "loser's" name in the pot. One woman is more aloof from the others. I see her leg as she steps out from the side to watch. (122 words)

I have fallen out of the sky, perhaps an airplane, and am lost up in the mountains in the deep snow. I feel like giving up. It's too much to imagine I can make it back down the mountain. Then I realize I must try. I crawl and struggle. Someone else is in a house trying to watch TV. She has a movie on one channel and another movie comes on. It is confusing. By the time I come down off the mountain, I have an injured leg. [BL] (88 words)
Barb Sanders:#3006 (09/08/96)

I am sitting on the ground. Abner, my cousin, comes over to me and sits beside me. He gently puts his arm around me. We have had to not be romantic all our lives because we are cousins. But now we are older and can't have children, so it's OK for us to be romantic and have a loving relationship. I feel strange, like this isn't right, and yet I am drawn to the soft, quiet, loving sense of it. Now Willie drives up and sees us. He is jealous. Now the three of us are in his car driving somewhere. They both love me. I sit between them. I love Abner best. (113 words)
Barb Sanders:#3007 (09/11/96)

I am looking through an old box of things and come across a newspaper clipping. I also see a paper I wrote on. The beginning word of each sentence created its own sentence, when you put them together. I chuckle to see my old childish way of coding words. I read the words. It says, "I am a playwright." I look at the newspaper clipping: a head and shoulders shot of me, like when I was the manager of the Fair Store in M City. The paragraph under it said I had received some awards for my writing. Some man, who is annoyed and jealous, says that I always get mentioned before and after banquet events. How come? I feel a little embarrassed. (123 words)
Barb Sanders:#3008 (09/11/96)

I am going to see some kind of event, maybe a fair or a sporting event. Jake may be with me. I walk down many, many stairs, looking for the place. It doesn't seem to be that many people around. I go into a room and a fun ride is there. I want to go on it, so I sit down on the dresser. There should be a basket like thing to sit in, but it's not there. A woman goes and gets a wire basket, white, and places it so I can put my feet in it and have better support that way. The ride begins and it is actually fun as the dresser swirls and twirls around the room. It is more exciting than I usually experience with this kind of ride. (134 words)
Barb Sanders:#3009 (09/12/96)

I am lying down in a car somewhere and three different people and a couple are trying to have sex with me. It is very unpleasant. There are no sexual feelings, just a sense of disgust and being used and forced. They get up and leave and one man is still there, and I say to him, "I hope that doesn't happen again." (63 words)
Barb Sanders:#3010 (09/12/96)

I am in a room and my stepfather and my "mother" and some other people are there. I am experiencing some pain on the inside of my mouth on the right cheek, like I bit it and it is sore. The stepfather is distant and not helpful as I point out my pain. [BL] (53 words)
Barb Sanders:#3011 (09/13/96)

Jerome comes into the room. He is having an affair with a woman, or maybe with me. I see his wife and feel wary. Jerome and I talk, exchanging some key or a lock on the sly. His wife has no idea. I think Jerome is very cute and good-looking. I am somewhat attracted to him and he to me. (60 words)

I see a data form. The name B. is typed out. There are other columns laid out, but when I push, or perhaps some other woman pushes the computer buttons, the columns shift around into different configurations and sizes. I am organizing something. I do it in chunks or blocks. [BL] (50 words)
Barb Sanders:#3013 (09/15/96)

I am in a huge Victorian house with other people. There are lots of kids. I am going down the halls and seeing groups of kids spilling out of the rooms and into the hallways. Now water is rushing in and I must run as fast as I can upstairs to the roof. I make it to the small windowed room at the very top. Now that room is like a space craft, NASA to be exact, hexagonal in shape, or the cone tip on the rocket. We must escape. I and some others are put into a suspended state, sort of like the beam-up thing in Star Trek. It disengages all our molecules, stores them and when we arrive at the new planet, which will support human life, we are reassembled. We travel hundreds of years and then I am reactivated. I guess earth was being destroyed and the smartest and best leaders, especially with good facilitating skills, were chosen to start the new home. (166 words)
Barb Sanders:#3014 (09/16/96)

I am going to have to travel since I now am in some military or spy organization. I look into the mirror at my hair. It is coal black and then I notice that only a small part of the front is black, the rest is my usual brown-gray color. A man offers to help me make my hair look better. I am alone and isolated and agree to let him help me. I shampoo my hair, standing up at the mirror. Then he shapes and cuts my hair. Now I am moving into my new quarters. I look out the window and see snow falling, a light dusting on the ground and the grass ends at the beginning of a giant wall of the other cement building. It's a big complex. I then look into the room and survey the sparse furniture, the lack of any decorations, etc., a single bed. I feel lonely. (155 words)
Barb Sanders:#3015 (09/17/96)

I am in a car, driving. I look ahead and see the road is slathered with oil. I guess they are repaving the road. I hesitate, thinking I won't go because I'll ruin the car and besides, maybe the road doesn't go through and I'll get stuck. Then I see another car coming through from the other way and know I can get through. I see the oil is splattered in a thick layer on the front of the car from them going too fast and splashing it all over themselves. I decide to try it, but slower. I don't feel good about the decision, but decide to do it anyway. I start driving. It is slick. Now I am in the back seat of a limo with gangsters. I have been captured by the son of a gangster. They are going to kill me because my father, also a gangster, killed the son's father's brother. Now they seek revenge. He is pursuing me, but he is also attracted to me, and somewhere deep in me I am attracted to him, but I am running from him for my life. I also profess hatred of him. I am aloof and distant. Now I am told to sit in the front seat. I do so; there are maybe six gangster guys in the two back seats. I fall asleep. Now the car stops and he opens the passenger side door to wake me up, but he watches my sleeping face, falling in love with me. He leans down and slowly and sweetly kisses me. I respond to him lovingly and then wake up to realize what I've done and go back to my frozen, distant posture. But now he knows I love him too. We have arrived at a small shabby cabin by the beach. It is empty of any furnishings. I am standing in the living room, near a window that looks out to the beach front. The father is in the back bedroom. The son goes in there, walks into a closet and changes his clothes. The father says, "We are going to kill you, because your father killed my brother." I am watching the son in the closet and I say, "Maybe you should force me to be his maid (was thinking wife). I would hate that above all else." The father likes this idea. He pushes it up one more level and says, "You will be my son's wife," thinking that would be hell for me and a suitable revenge. Now the father is gone and I see the son approaching me. I back up, trying to stay away from his radiant charm because it is so hard to resist. I am backed literally into a corner of the room and I turn my back to him, my face into the corner. He walks sensually up to me, puts his hands on my shoulders and turns me back around to face him and slowly, like in the movies, kisses me. I try to resist but my true feelings leaks out into that kiss. He smiles down at me and whispers, "That's all I wanted to know." (529 words)

I am trying to convince this man, who is aloof and does not respect me, that I am not a sexual slut as he seems to be convinced I am. I am looking at a scrapbook with each of my previous boyfriends in it, in chronological order. Each one has a fond memory but the overall feeling of each one is that he was a mistake. There was something wrong with each one, bad choices. (75 words)

Ernie is seated at my computer and working on something to help me get things straightened out. I am at the back of the computer looking at the connections. Something needs to be plugged in again and he says he will do it for me and I say, "No, I need to learn to do it." I plug a yellow round wire end into a tiny yellow hole, and the same with a black one and then I hesitate with the pink one and Ernie says, "Yes, that's right, you've got it." I grin and say, "I only watched it being done before. It's hard to remember how to do things unless you do them yourself." He agrees. I then find my wheelchair, which is sort of folded up like a manual. I struggle to unfold it myself. The backpack, or recharger, is stuck and Ernie reaches over and unhooks it so I can continue. (155 words)
Barb Sanders:#3018 (09/23/96)

I am staying over night at Ernie and Ginny's, although the house I've never seen before (in real life). I had been trying to sleep, but can't. I had been watching a TV program about a nine hundred and something pound man in a manual wheelchair. He used to be a football player. Now I get up and go downstairs. I am in my nightie, so I hope the front room curtains are pulled. Then it looks like they aren't; I rush up to close them. And I see it was an optical illusion, they really were closed. Now I turn on the TV again to continue watching the show about the fat, disabled man. He moves with grace, the blubber on him sort of bouncing and flowing around him. Someone thinks or the narrator says that it is kind of fascinating to watch. You gain some measure of respect or empathy when you get to know him. Now Ernie comes in from outside, he and Ricardo. He is surprised to see me up at 4:00 in the morning. I tell him I couldn't sleep so I got up for awhile. He asks how I'm doing on the dictionary. I say I'm still writing. He asks me why. I say because it's a way of talking out-loud to myself to hear what I'm thinking. Then I realize he said dictionary. I say, "Oh, I thought you meant journal." I then say, "The reason I'm still working on the dictionary is that I am a poor speller. It's just a disability I have. I have to check each word's spelling, the endings and if it's in the right nook." Ernie is a bit disdainful; that it takes me so long. He mentions he had a couple of accidents and hurt himself. He then had a quick vision. He said three things, one of which was an eagle and a feather. I am impressed with this powerful vision. I know he will look down on me for this, but I say, "It is similar to a dream, isn't it?" Ernie shrugs his shoulders and says nonchalantly, "Of course, you'd try and find meaning in it. It's just that in my family people die of this and it got me to thinking." I say, sympathetically, "Ah, well, in my family they die of stomach cancer. We each have our thing to die with." Ernie then wants to know if I can sleep single, meaning can I join a person on the couch hide-a-bed. He is concerned for me and wants me to get my sleep. I say, "No thanks. I'll stay up awhile and then go back to my bed upstairs." He asks again, a different way. I decline. He shrugs and says good night. (462 words)

I am walking around a sort of track and field shaped area. It's a store. I need to go pee and find a bathroom. I sit and pee and pee, but can't get relief. I hear the loud sound of peeing and feel the pee going down my leg. I get up, a bit uncomfortable about all that urine all over my dress and in my moccasins. I walk on. I see a deli counter, sort of a Safeway Bakery. I find a bag of rolls or muffins and decide to get one. I read the ingredients to make sure there is no sugar in them. I continue strolling. As I walk, I nearly step on the end row boat of a string of boats. It is a rowing team. Justin, Lucy's husband, is learning to row and is lying down on his back in the last boat (like it's a train of them). I smile and apologize for nearly stepping on him. I think I embarrassed him and feel bad about that. I choose a sweater to buy. I put it on and notice it is quite huge, longer than my dress. I see Delores M and she has a sweater like it. It is pink knit, half sleeves. I notice I can see my dress underneath the sweater. Delores is telling me how she fought with the telephone company over a one thousand dollar bill and they agreed to remove 300 dollars of it. She was quite proud of that. I congratulate her. I say to Delores, "It looks like I'd better always wear a dress under this thing. After all, my boyfriend is disabled, but he's not blind." A group of young women burst out laughing at my amusing joke. I grin and stroll on. I still have to pee, so as I am walking, I pee down my leg. I am a bit embarrassed about the urine smell and being in public. I sit at a cafe table and three men join me; I continue peeing, hoping they don't notice. (344 words)

I am at some college function. The entertainment, two black men who are blind, comes. I happen to be sitting right where they sit down. I am pleased and say things like, "My friend Lucy is blind." The black man, with thick lips and dreadlocks, looks toward me scornfully and says, "Who asked you?" Then he starts picking on me. He asks me how come my lips look so funny, all pursed out when I say words. I start to explain it's a combination of entertainment and it's also sort of the way my lips just move. Then I say to him, "Well, you should talk. Look at your lips, all thick." We do this back and forth for a while. Now I am running on a track. There is a cluster of uniformed track women running ahead. I, the dreamer, watch them pass and I look way beyond them down the track and see me dead last. I have a limp and I am slow, but I am up and I am running. I feel good about that. Now I go to my dorm room, only I accidentally go to the 7th floor and have to walk back down some stairs. I find the name Vfabray and know that's my roommate's name. I go in and see belated Xmas presents for Charla have arrived. I open them, and notice my roommate has already opened some and put the tiger lily flowers up in a hanging plant thing. It looks pretty, but I wish she'd waited for Charla. I look out the window and see some things like kites flying around, not making it very high and crashing to the ground. They are not damaged. (285 words)

I am sitting on a couch. A friend, Keith, also a friend of Derek's (not in real life), comes in and behind him is walking, with some effort, Derek. I am surprised. He comes in and talks a bit. I respond back in a friendly manner. He is still uptight about our breakup and non-connection of the last few months. Keith comes over and sits beside me on the couch. Derek walks over and puts his face between our faces. I kiss him on the cheek. He is still distant, but then he keeps talking and I keep talking and then he kisses me on the lips in a genuine sweet kiss. (112 words)

I have two or three female roommates. We are going to a wedding or a party. One woman is interested in another woman. I look at her face. It is a fishy monster face like those odd fish creatures on Star Trek movie, with bulbous eyes on the side of their heads. The other woman laughs in her face and says, "No thanks, I have this man in mind." We are at the party, in a room. The women search out their men and they are accepted, all but me. I watch the people; I walk around. Now a group of them are forming a circle. It is the group of people with disabilities, although they look normal enough. A tall man is talking. I like him. He is across the circle from me. As the circle moves and more people join, he and I are side by side. Everyone joins hands. His hand is warm, very warm. He glances down at me and smiles because he just felt how warm my hand was too. I like it. The feeling is we will get together later. Now I have a baby in front of me, the circle is gone and I am going to dress him in the garment I knitted for him, only as I try to put it on him, I see it has three legs. And the middle leg is off the needles and is unraveling. I try to save the stitches. I hole up a dress for him to approve, but it is a boy baby. He's not interested in a dress. This isn't working out. (270 words)

I am traveling down into the earth somehow. There are dangerous paths I must tread. Then one section would end at a white wall. I'd look for the beginning of the next segment. I look up at the ceiling and see a pull string. I pull it down and a small hatch hole appears with a pull down ladder which looks and sounds like a wooden toy with slats of wood on a string that cascade down into a different configuration. These slats then create a ladder. I walk up, pulling myself up the ladder. Now I am in a dangerous part where there are poisonous jungle snakes. I pull out a large knife. I see black shiny snakes coming out from under cups and dishes and statues on a shelf. I have to climb up on that shelf to go to the next level. A center statue is in the way and I decide I don't want that one anyway and choose another and then another. Someone says or I think, "Do they need an Elvis statue to get on with it?" Six snakes come out and I chop off their heads simultaneously. They are very beautiful with vibrant colors, turquoise and so on. Now I get to the next section. Each section is different. This one has people who are very aggressive and belligerent. I must out-bluster them to survive. I do so, easily. I have arrived. Now it is time to go back. I hold a sleeping bag-like thing and am zipping up the end, while it is still rolled up, making a spiral path for the zipper. Somehow this means I've discovered a faster, safer way through without taking those dangerous paths. But now a very noisy, aggressive boy whirls toward me. He wants my attention. He wants to go with me. A woman chuckles and said she found him at the site (setting) called Cathedral and his name is Daniel O'Flannery. We laugh at the irony of an obvious Irish Catholic boy being from a setting called the Cathedral. The boy has red hair and freckles and is cute and wholesome-looking. I tell him to leave me alone. His demanding, attention-getting behavior won't work with me. I then decide to go back through the paths. He follows me. I at first am concerned he'll be harmed, but then he asked for it. I warned him. So I decide this will be a lesson for him and go on, being aggressive and belligerent to the dangerous people on this path, in order to safely get through. I realize from his distant yelling he's scared and will get hurt. I call down the spiral to him, "Just be your fierce, aggressive self on this section. It will work for you." He does it and catches up to me. I turn to him and say, "This next section is the opposite. You have to be clever and quiet." He tries to do so. And we successfully return through all the different sections. (504 words)

I am involved in a family presentation of a play, perhaps one of mine. I can't find my script. The presentation time is in two hours and I search over and over, all around. Paulina asks me what I'm doing. I say, "Looking for my scripts." I can't remember my lines. I feel apprehensive. No one is very helpful. I ask where we are going to perform. I need to experience the stage area so I know what I'm working with. She shows me the back yard where a line is drawn. I say, "There?" pointing to a small cement square. "No," she says. "That line." I say, "That line? Is it the back stage boundary or the front?" She says, "The back boundary." I keep looking for the script, getting more desperate as time passes. (136 words)

I am in a church, attending a small town service. I think I'm there because a movie crew is in town. A number of famous movie actors, men, are there. I am sitting in the back. I really have to go pee and I get up at the end of the first section and walk. I have the directions that you go to the Splash room and find the restroom. I see a cafeteria room where people are getting refreshments. I see a line of women in a room and correctly guess that's the women's room. I get in line. I really have to pee bad. The last booth opens up, they each have flowered curtains for doors. I go in and it's a white, tall plastic kitchen trash can under a counter. I squinch under the counter and sit and begin to pee. My bladder is very full. I hesitate and then I tell myself quite realistically, "I am awake, it's OK to pee." I pee and pee, trying not to slop any out of the round container. Finally I am done, but I feel uncomfortable, like I still need to pee and that maybe it wasn't OK to pee, maybe I wasn't awake. A woman is talking to me very friendly and we are chatting. I reach for a toilet tissue and she hands me one, I look to make sure it wasn't her lunch as she is standing there eating her refreshments on the top of the counter. I notice a ham slice in my hand and hand it back to her. Now I am stuffing my changes of clothes back into a white plastic sack. It's time to get back to the church service. Now an older woman approaches the woman I am talking to. She says she's been chosen as her sponsor. The woman is distressed because the older woman is tough and won't let her get away with anything. She is, I now realize, addicted to something. The older woman smiles and says knowingly, "Yes, that's why I've been chosen." I leave now, kind of escaping the woman's company after discovering she is addicted. Now I return, only it's a swim pool, not a church. I peel off my clothes. Jack Lemmon and other men are in the pool already. Jack Lemmon laughs and calls out a joke for me to hear about male chauvinists. I chuckle and check to see if my bikini halter swim top is covering me OK. I have very flat breasts like Angel. I dive in and begin to swim laps hard and fast like an athlete. The church congregation begins to chant numbers, counting the strokes to go across the pool. I work hard and make good time and the crowd cheers. I am pleased about my prowess. (470 words)

Derek approaches me and begins to talk quite friendly and I respond back. It's like we are pretending the last few months or no communication ever happened. I feel glad that we are talking again. (35 words)

I have returned to school, university. I've been here for years. It is getting old. I think I will go to the first meeting of the Disability Student group. I start off in that direction, going up some stairs. I see Rochelle. We talk. She asks me where I am going and I tell her. She says, "Oh, boring. I'm not going to that thing. It's always the same." I agree it is often boring, but it is a good opportunity to meet the new, young disabled people, the activists. I mention to Rochelle that I am looking for a TV set, another one, for maybe $100. We see some advertisements posted on a board and I go up to look. Some TV's are mentioned for $40. But I decide to wait, because they won't be fancy enough to do what I want them to do. I never make it to class. (152 words)

Dan Dailey and a woman are lovers. They sweetly and deeply love each other and so much enjoy being in each other's company. They are making love. Later, Dan comes up to the woman and smiles and says, "Hey, like the mama kitty and the mama bird, you are the mama...." I don't remember it exactly. But it refers to earlier scenes where a cute kitty cat was taking care of its young and the same for a mama bird. It meant she was a very loving mama kind of person and he honored that in her.

I have so many books that they would fill up two huge library-sized rooms. I and a child like Charla are trying to walk down some stairs that are like piles of books. She had taken a 5 milligram dose of Cortisone and I was worried about this habit. I said, "That's like taking speed. That's not good for you." (60 words)

I am an enthusiastic and creative lawyer. I am a bit like Debra Winger. My client won't give me much, if any, information. He gives me non-verbal hints. At one point he acts like he had an allergy so I know that the man on the witness stand had an allergy and used this to ferret out important information. At one point, I put fake, funny, pink pig ears on my client, and a fake pig nose. I dramatically and humorously use this to make another important point. I do well. Now I am walking down a corridor and behind me comes a good-looking man who tells me he saw my work in court and admires me. We talk, enjoying each other's company. We then become boyfriend and girlfriend. I think his name is Roger, or perhaps my previous boyfriend was named Roger. Now I go to my home and he is with me. We are talking about my previous boyfriend and his flaws. Someone knocks on the door and I open it. It is an elephant, a big one, and three different gurus. One wears a golden Indian outfit. Another is in modest white Indian costume. They want me to feed the elephant. They ask me if I have a large gallon pan. I search around and find a big metal mixing bowl. They say that will be fine. Meanwhile I am having a sort of discussion/argument with my lawyer boyfriend. (242 words)

I think I am at school, maybe like the community college, but the buildings do not look familiar. I am inside and walking around. I see myself playing my violin and I am playing the Hungarian Dance # 5. I am doing very well, which surprises me because I had worked so hard on that piece as a child and made so many errors then. I am cautious of the places where I had trouble before, but manage to do them right this time. The audience loves me and is enthusiastic. Now I am done with that and walking to meet Bonnie. I go the wrong way and have to back track in to meet her by the elevators. On my way there, I go to a table where magazines and so on are. I pick up one that has the picture of me doing the Hungarian Dance solo on the cover. It was a special report edition. I don't look like me at all. I have short black hair framing my face. I feel a bit uncomfortable that I don't look like me, so how will people know that is me? At the same time, I am also pleased to be so prominently displayed. Now I am going down a road. I am in Russia, I think. Another woman and two men are sort of joining me. One man, very good-looking, likes me. He cooks something for me. I say something about how far I always seem to have to travel to get to the festival or whatever we are going to. I say, "And now, we're in Russia where everything is so far away from everything. If the festival were in the next city, it'd be a far distance to travel." The man hands me a grilled cheese sandwich with special cheese on the outside of it too. He grumbles a bit, teasing me, that I could have had the steak sandwich he made, but no, I didn't like that. I only liked the cheese. I nibble on the sandwich. It is tasty. (345 words)

At first I am with strange beings, perhaps aliens, or spiritual beings or simply another planet. Things are done differently there. I must get used to the terrain. I am then called out of bed and outside to rehearse a disability skit with perhaps Bonnie. She holds my hands as she is up high on a cardboard box and I am down below calling to her. I am pulling at her and falling down. I ask her loudly why we don't have accessibility yet. "How long has it been since 1983 when it was law and we still don't have it?" I then pause and suggest to her we do this skit out on the parking lot where people could actually see it. She doesn't want to and I drag her out there, cardboard box and all. This is going to annoy the bosses of the place I work at, a car dealership or manufacturing place. The personnel office is looking for me now. A man questions me and wants to know if I know what cars they sell. I say, "The 2400 (something) does really well. And in the used cars we sell lots of Pontiacs." Then I start to travel through the rooms, which are full of shoebox-sized cardboard boxes all piled loosely on top of each other. How I travel is to step into a box and move to the next pile of boxes, like I go through a door into a room. A phone rings and the office people ask me another question. Then they want to know if Carmen Jones is there. I say, "Just a minute," and look in the next room where a light-colored black man is sitting in a manual wheelchair (like in movie I saw yesterday called Inside Moves). I ask him if he is Carmen Jones. He says, "Yes." (309 words)

I am lying in bed and Jock comes into the room and lies down with me. He is quiet and I realize he wants to make love to me. I feel his penis hard against my vagina. I am surprised since he is gay but I love him as a friend and I agree we can do this. I ask him if he has a rubber. He says, "Of course." I later wonder if he put it on and leave it to him to have done so. I don't want AIDS, but I don't push to make sure he is wearing the rubber. His penis is a bit small and he has some difficulty getting it in. He is a bit annoyed with me and asks me to change my position, maybe put a pillow under my hips to make it easier for him. I begin to move around and he is excited and I am uptight and can't relax and enjoy it. He has an orgasm and I am left frustrated, hardly aroused. I am disappointed and feel a bit used. Now it is New Year's Eve and people are celebrating out in the streets. I see Jock very sad and morose and I realize he is thinking of suicide. He lies down in a large puddle of water and sinks down into it. I sit on the edge and watch, thinking he won't go through with it and waiting for him to sputter to the surface. I watch the air bubbles rise. Then he does float up and I am shocked to learn he did try for it and isn't breathing. I grab him and try to do CPR, but now he isn't a person but a fold up case like a crimping iron. I can't find any lungs so I keep pressing first this side and then that, unfolding him as best I can. It isn't working. I then pull him into a diesel truck. He is a human again and I try to call 911. Lots of other people are ahead of me and it is hard to reach help. We finally get through. Now I am walking back down a flight of stairs and a woman is telling me of the other women he had sexual affairs with while cheating on Melinda. Sandy is the name of one of them. I don't remember the name of the other. I feel cheapened and used and sad. (410 words)

Two men, one tiny and one large, are in partnership to poison us. I am a member of a rich family and the large man is like a butler to us. We have to become like detectives to figure out what they are up to. They have a spittle-like white substance they are using to poison us with. Somehow, the man in my family manages to poison them with their own poison. It takes a while to act, so when they learn they'd been poisoned, they suddenly stop chasing us and decide to go to the theatre. We don't trust them and follow to keep an eye on them. The woman of the family, Polly, comes with us. I am sort of her. We follow them outside the mansion. A large group of our employees are out there, doing yard work and cleaning things and laying down a layer of dirt for the garden or the patio. They stare at us in disbelief, because we are not dressed up fancy like we always do, but in ordinary comfortable clothes, even though we are going to the theatre. I (Polly) pause, then say, "You people are sure snobs. This is a style called comfort." They then laugh and relax a bit. I say, "I bought it at the best store in town for this sort of thing," and I name a local, cheap clothing store. They joke back. Now the two poisoned men don't feel well and decide to come back in the mansion. We try to follow them, still not trusting them to cause us damage. The large man has changed into a robe and is laying face down on a couch. The tiny man is locked in the bathroom feeling ill, so we assume. The large man had said something to me on the way back in about how they had managed to take Polly with them, meaning they had poisoned her on the sly. I try to find the piece of paper in a sheaf of them in my hand to prove what they said, because I didn't really catch it all and was unsure if they said that or not. I need to know because if it is true, I must tell Polly. I can't find it. Finally the large man says it's all right. We didn't poison Polly. (392 words)

I am in a sort of classroom, only it's sort of like my house. I am explaining to the instructor (male) that he doesn't understand, what I'm dealing with is more complex than just the English language (like parts of speeches). I am working with Natural Language Programming. As I tell him this, I am moving a broken office chair (the back rest is lopsided and partially unattached) to another room and out of the way, only where I'm putting it is sort of where my computer would be in my house.

I am visiting someone, maybe Corinne at M City, only I don't recognize the house. I am looking for my pills because I've just realized that I didn't pack any and I see that my mother didn't either. I notice she did pack all my jewelry, which I never wear. How annoying. I start to dig into all my old purses, which apparently my mother packed too, because, as I explain to some woman, I often don't clean out my old purses and I am used to carrying spare pills just in case, but no luck. I find a few pills, which when I look closely, are merely vitamin like things, round and yellow. I sigh. I need to call my doctor and have him prescribe a temporary supply of pills for three days, which is how long I'm going to visit here. I can't remember how to use the phone. My mother tells me to push the save tab on a card index file. I say, "Oh sure, I remember now. I push it and pick up a brochure and put it up to my ear like it's the receiver. I complain I can't hear very well. There are too many people talking in the room. So my father pushes me back, like I'm in a chair and he is shoving the chair with me in it until I am back in a roomy clothes closet. I can't remember the doctor's name. I remember Dr. A. and say, "But they switched me to some other doctor, a Doctor ... Mendelsohn. I am ambivalent about which doctor to call. I finally decide on the new one since the paperwork would go more smoothly, although it would be nice to talk to Dr. An. because he knows my case. I notice I am naked and have an excessive amount of long dark brown armpit hair and pubic hair. I am a bit surprised. I've never had so much hair there before. I used to shave. I must have let it grow for a long time. I am younger, maybe in my 30's. My body is pudgy but firm and soft, a nice pretty body. (363 words)

I meet up with Dylan. We are talking but there is some tension between us. Perhaps I feel competition or we are arguing. As we are talking, we are in some big institutional building of some sort, a woman comes over and turns her face away from Dylan and practically whispers, "I'm pregnant." I hear her, but Dylan doesn't and he continues talking. I interrupt him and say, "Did you hear her?" I make her repeat it. Dylan looks at me like, "Can you take over with this client?" He wants my help. I reluctantly agree. I say, "Can we use your office?" He says yes. I start to enter a room but he says, "No, my office is moved now." We go around the corner to another room. I open the door and see it is a long l-shaped room with lots of wooden chairs and desks. Some women from another department are also working in there. I look over the situation and ask the client if it is OK with her that we work in here, because having other people around could be a confidentiality problem. She reluctantly agrees. I see another room, used as a classroom, and now the women have used it as a coat room. I pull her in there. I say we may be occasionally interrupted. So we sit and she starts doing all kinds of avoidance behaviors, walking around, chatting about other things, etc. I firmly say to her, "You have three (I was contemplating five but decided that was too long) minutes to quiet down and work or I will leave." She ignores me and continues but at precisely three minutes has managed to sit quietly. I start to work with her about being pregnant and she starts up again. This time I give her two minutes. She doesn't stop and I go get my coat and scarf and start to leave. Then I suddenly turn and get right up in her face and fix her with a knowing stare. Her eyes become big and scared. "Uh-huh," I say. "You just confirmed it. You are a lesbian and that is the issue you really want to work with." I feel quite proud, even a bit arrogant about this amazing bit of intuition. I start to leave and she tries to follow. I say to her, a bit harshly, "I want to make it clear. We are not counselor and client anymore. We are not, I repeated, relationship and client...I mean, counselor and client." I am saying this to her so she clearly understands I am not working with her professionally so she won't be confused if we talk about things informally. (449 words)

I am changing my clothes because Darryl and his bride came to our family dinner and I want to look nice. I go into a room and find some girl clothes, maybe Charla's hanging in the closet. I can't seem to find my own clothes. I see a large suitcase on a bed with a pile of rumpled clothes in it and dig around. I find a pair of jeans that may be big enough for my Buddha belly. I start to put them on when a small wooden sliding door opens and Doug is peeking in to see if he can see me naked. I tell him to get away. I am mad at him. I look again at the jeans and see they are way too big. They are Kyle's jeans. That won't do. I am feeling desperate. I want to look nice and I don't seem to have anything nice to wear. I do find a pretty rusty brown top and skirt and I have a petticoat on. I am telling some woman there that maybe the petticoat will show under the skirt because it is too long. She says, "It's fine," but I take it off. I actually do look fairly nice. I return to the dinner where a jumble of food is all over the table. I shyly talk with Darryl and his bride. I am thinking that it has been so many years but it is fitting we are together again. There is also some bad feeling that it is going to be wrong for us to get married. We would not be good for each other after all. (275 words)

Eric gives me some papers to finish up for him. I am required to paint some pasty kind of stuff over the text or pictures and then rub it onto another paper with a roller. I see some baby raccoons, a cute big raccoon and some text that is too big for the size paper I should rub it onto. I struggle. Sometimes the substance I am using is thick, gooey and black, but sometimes it's a rusty color. I am worried I am not doing it right and may ruin it for Nate. I peel some of them off to see if it is working. I can't tell. Some are all right, some have black goop all over both sides, like carbon paper. (124 words)

I am visiting the B's. Ernie is talking with some man and I am lying on a couch listening. I ask where Ginny is. He says in the bedroom. She'll be out in a minute. I am petting a large white and spotted cat with a Mohawk fur cut. I chuckle at the cat. I remember that Fluffy is gray and wonder where she is. Now the boys, Ricardo, Rigo and some of their friends pull me out onto a play area like a skating rink in a park. I am on a skateboard with all my things in my lap. I have knitting and clothes for warmth. It is winter. They are laughing and pulling me around and around. It is fun. I say, "Wait a minute, let me check my knitting." I see it has fallen under me and pull it out. One needle has all the stitches on it. The second needle is pulled out of the blue yarn. I try to put the stitches back on the needle as the boys continue to drag me around. Now Ernie is laughing and sitting squatted down like on a cold day, rubbing his hands. Ginny then walks up to me in a huge clown suit like a cat with a Mohawk. I say, "Are you on stilts?" and look and I see she is standing on my wooden crutches like they are stilts. We are all having fun. (240 words)

I am in a hospital. I have a female roommate, sort of like Michelle Pfeiffer. I am being released and so is she, but then she comes back to tell me she has to have a surgery and can't leave yet. Her surgery will happen on the 21st. I say, "Too bad," and she leaves for another room. I wish, after she is gone, I had asked for her name and address so I could write her. Not that I wanted to, but that is what people do and I should have. I am packing up the files I had been working on while in the hospital, the Hollywood information on movies I'd been watching. Then Grandma Agnes comes in, much slimmer than she usually was, and asked me why I wasn't at the family gathering at her house yesterday. I say, embarrassed and caught, "I was busy doing stuff." So she, two aunts and my father come in to visit. They sit in a circle on chairs and I am lying down on a couch. We all go to sleep during our conversation. I wake up and so do they, and I feel embarrassed like I should have been more attentive. But I also think it is amusing that we all fell asleep together. Some visit! (217 words)

I am getting into a group of women who are going into a bleachers area to sing group songs. I don't know what holiday it is, but this is a usual holiday thing to do. I and Andrea are trying to catch up with our group, but get lost and end up with a group of swimmers and divers. There is a swimming pool to the right, and in front of our bleachers is a pool used as the stage area. I watch a scene where a man and a woman get in a small rectangular rowboat and sing as we all sing the chorus. A wave or two comes up and splashes the woman and she mimes jumping up real quick so it doesn't get her all wet on her bottom. I and Aunt Bridget are sitting on the right side of the bleachers. It is very crowded. We sing along with the group but don't know the songs. I notice my voice is clear and pretty and I seem to be able to keep up with the words by listening carefully. I look over to the bleachers on my left and up and see a small group of people in green sort of fish costumes with green makeup on their faces. They are pretty and all the same. Now muffins and cookies and cakes are being served to the crowd and I can see they are moist and sweet and would taste really good, better than if we'd stayed with our own group. I look to my right and notice the water is all gone from the swim pool. There had been some girls taking lessons there. [BL] (279 words)

I am in a house I've never seen before, a big one. I'm in the kitchen. I'm hungry and looking around for something to eat. Pickings are slim. I hear Howard outside in the front yard telling the neighborhood children not to play in our yard. I hear his boring, dead voice droning on about civic responsibility. I idly wonder if I could sleep with him now and have sex. I feel forgiving and try to imagine if I could do it without feeling horrible. It is a possibility. He comes in and I am at the sink rinsing a bunch of spaghetti and pretzels in the sink. He suggests I could go out and talk to the kids sometime. I say, "I agree I need something to do, but giving civic lessons to the kids isn't going to be it." Then I ask if he is hungry. He says yes, a little bit. I then hesitate and then ask if I can fix him some toast, or even fry a couple of eggs. I am relieved when he says no. I see a plastic container full of cooked spinach and ask him if that is his. He says yes. I see that he is on his belly on the floor, digging around in a cupboard for something. I ask him what he's trying to get. He says salt. I see him pick it up awkwardly with his teeth. I take it from his mouth and use it to salt his spinach and then my spaghetti. I notice he had put an unshucked ear of corn on my plate. I touch it. It is cool, and uncooked too. I decide not to salt it yet, but cook it first. (289 words)

I am on a beach and I see the actor John Ritter and we talk. He says, "Remember me?" I say yes. Then we are lying down and he puts his arm over me and kisses me. Then he gently says, "I know this upsets you, so it's OK if we don't make love." I say, touched, "If I were going to do it with anyone, it would be you." He is touched. Then I say, "And I want it to be you." We kiss again and then we get up to go to his hotel room. But first he notices that the ocean has come up over a high sand dune hill and we get concerned because it could all come roaring down on us and it would be dangerous, so we begin to run back toward the hotel. We have to cross the "nuclear fields" first (a patch of unmowed pasture). As we are approaching an embankment we'll have to go up and over, it begins to rain hard. We laugh at the irony that we are fated to get wet somehow (baptism?). Water pours out through the apple trees we are under. We are concerned it will be hard to get through all the blackberry vines on the embankment, but then we see a few wooden steps and easily get up to the road. We enter the hotel. He is the manager and works there, so he comes in later than me and waits down the hall. I have two empty champagne glasses in one hand and am wet from the rain and wear a sleeveless T-shirt and look sexy and cute. I come past the desk and come to him and he smiles. I say, "Was I obvious?" He says, "Yes," laughing gently. Now we walk to his room and I suddenly remember or he reminds me that I left Charla in a room alone sleeping. I feel guilt and hope she is all right. We get in his room and for some reason he's upset and says he can't do it now. I understand but am disappointed. He sleeps on a couch with the couch pillows stacked up, but it's real uncomfortable. I am asleep on the bed. Then in his sleep, he gets up and stumbles over to the bed and before you know it, we roll over into each other's arms and make love (no sexual feelings, but contentment and comfort). (408 words)

I and my handicapped boyfriend are being ostracized because of our relationship. He is younger than me and handicapped, so I have been kicked out of school, all my money taken from me and no place to live. I do not give up my boyfriend though. I only have one privilege left. I can attend one class at school. I can't participate, but I can attend. I go there. No one speaks to me. I feel shame because I used to be quite popular and influential. I feel pride also in not backing down. I sit up in the highest row. The seats are like wooden, old theatre seats. The class is beginning. Down in the center is a group of students who are portraying judge and jury and lawyers. A young man is first to present his question or debate issue. He asks how come there aren't any pretty women for him to ask out in his small town and is this fair? I wonder to myself how fair is it that he isn't all that good-looking. How arrogant. Now a woman, like Mirabelle, reminds the group they haven't done the Bible thing and people pull out their Bibles. They begin to recite the Lord's Prayer. I start to do it from memory to be a part of the group, even though I think this is silly. A tiny disabled woman in a wheelchair behind me (maybe has osteoporosis) sarcastically uses silly words to the Lord's Prayer to show her defiance to this issue. I want to join her and would like for her to approve of me, and I want to join the group and have them approve of me. It's a dilemma. Now a young man walks up to a young woman next to me and wants to sit with her. He likes her. Then they change their seats and go down to a front row. I watch them as he tries to shyly move closer to her and she realizes he wants to hug and she moves closer to him and so on. Now one of the center group people calls on a woman on my right. She is a nun with short dark brown hair. In a pageboy kind of cut. She says she's not sure she can share her case because it isn't... and she can't remember the word. I supply it for her, "copyrighted." I am ignored. (404 words)

I am going to the Doctor's office. I see Dr. A having a cup of coffee. He is seated in a wooden school desk, the type with a wooden arm on one side. He sees me and asks me to have a cup of coffee with him. He is gentle and pleasant, seeming to want my company. We chat for awhile. He pats me on the arm and says sweetly, "I love you." He doesn't mean man/woman, but friendship. I say, "I love you too." He goes on. Then I remember I need a refill on my cortisone. I go in. A woman doctor says she can fill the prescription. It is a shot. I really live in some other town but decide to go ahead and get this month's shot now and save time. She is friendly with her women patients; she is sort of New Age. She now has a cream that looks like shaving cream and raises my blouse to expose my upper belly just below my breasts. This is the correct spot for the application of the cream. I am concerned that she might put too much on, how does it time itself for a whole month, and so on. She asks me how much I take and I say, "Four milligrams a day." I sort of feel this isn't right, but I can't remember any other number that is correct. She rubs the cream into my skin and that's that. There is no pain, and it's done. Then she offers a raffle ticket to me and two other women to go to a party and enjoy ourselves. After we are done, we can get reimbursed for the cost of the ticket by my brother Dwight. (290 words)

We had a wonderful time at the party and it is 2 or 3 in the morning. It is time to go. The other two women insist I call Dwight right now and get our raffle ticket reimbursement. I say, "It's too late." They insist, so I try to find his number. I say, "He hasn't got a number of his own," and then I remember he's married now and not living with my parents. I find the number. I don't feel good about this. I wake him up and tell him what we want. He says gently but firmly, "No, that's not fair. It was her raffle ticket. Why should I have to pay out of my own pocket?" I can see the reasoning on this and feel bad and caught between Dwight and the two women. I explain to them. (142 words)

I am feeling very ill. My daughter Ellie had been very ill with the flu. I guess it was my turn now. I am semi-lying in an overstuffed chair. I look down and see both my legs are in one leg hole of a huge man's briefs. I am embarrassed. I notice my fat belly. I am naked, but the flu and the fever is so bad I can barely move. Ellie comes over to me and leans close. I feel her take something in her mouth and put it in me somehow. It is a hard lump of something I can feel and move around in my belly. It is very uncomfortable. I get up with difficulty and try to walk. I had seen a woman that looks like a witch woman and I need to go to her. Now I am on a toy train and it has rubber tires and as I drive it around the narrow wooden structure, the wooden gates are too low and I have to think my way through. I finally arrive where the witch woman is. Lots of people are sick. I find her lying on her face in a kind of trance as she works with someone else. I tell her my daughter put this horrible thing in me and I am sick. She works with me and gets it out for me. I get back on the train for a ride. (241 words)

I am in a some kind of McDonald place where it caters to kids. I am ordering some hamburgers and so on. There are toys there to buy as well. A girl is looking at a set of baby clothes all in the same soft orange color. I leaf through them as they are presented in a book like form. Now I see my parents. I notice that my mother is quite tall, nearly as tall as my father is, but they still look good together. I notice how regal she stands and looks. Then I notice she has a bald swath through her pretty hair. She is delightedly sniffing the bags of hamburgers and exclaiming how wonderful they smell. Somewhere, either earlier in this dream or perhaps another dream, is a short pudgy man with really bad hair, sort of fuzzy and tough and grows in spots. He shows me the back row of his hair how unkempt it grows and sighs because he likes me and feels his hair will turn me away from him. Now I or my father sees some notice or advertisement about a piece of real estate where people can go to fulfill their dreams, or act them out. I see a white plastic molded bench which sits three people, the middle one a bit more high and centered than the other two. Then I see three people sitting on the bench in ballet costumes. These people want to dance ballet. Then I see a fat older man who is a playwright. He is writing a play these people can dance. But he is stuck and can't figure out what to write. He is lying in a recliner chair which is laid back on its back on the floor and he is seated in the chair, also lying on the floor. He is devastated because he is so stuck and can't come up with anything creative. Maybe he never had talent in the first place. He then goes to a body of water and purchases used pills to kill himself with. I wonder what "used" pills means and reassure myself it means not used and then too old and weak, not that people swallowed them already once. He takes a bunch of the pills but doesn't die because they had lost all their potency. But he plods on, determined to figure out how to write this play. Then an idea comes to him; he could use dreams. They could do dance movements like dream scenes come to him -- energy, surprise, beauty. So he writes it and I hear the male lead dancing it. The dance area is ringed with old apartments where two or three stubborn old men have refused to move out and they insist on living there so close to the dance area that their normal living movements are distracting to the audience of the dance. So I hear the one old man asking the lead dancer as he is doing his wonderful leaps and so on, does he know a word he needs for this crossword. The dancer keeps hissing at him through his clenched teeth, "I am dancing here!" But the old man ignores that and keeps asking his question. (541 words)

I am an odd-looking computer machine, quite bulky, old-fashioned and metal. I am told to check out www.20.com. So I don't know how to do this, but push a lot of buttons, one that says "w." on it. All of a sudden, I notice that many different printers are starting to print. An old-fashioned calculator, adding machine is printing out numbers on a paper roll. Then money in the form of bills come out of a metal slide and start dumping out. I run around to the front to retrieve them before they get wet in the water or blow away in the wind. (104 words)

Boomer, the cat, and I are walking to M City over the mountains. We are walking up a forested meadow hill when I see herds of sheep and deer and other animals running from the mountain down the hill past us. I am worried they will trample us, but we stand and the go around us. Some people too. I think there must be a forest fire. I look for smoke. I see a small puff but not enough to indicate danger. I hesitate making the decision should I go on or not. I decide to go on and continue as we crest the hill, I am startled and scared when I see a huge forest fire coming right at us. We turn and run as fast as we can back down the hill to find the creeks and rivers we had seen to jump into. We find one in the nick of time and dive in. I hold Boomer and we hold our breath until we must have oxygen and then gulp up some air and back under. It is touch and go. But finally the fire passes us, leaving charred remains and smoke, a close call. Now we decide we have to get to M City some other way. I see a dirt road and choose another one. I am driving a Volkswagen bus, an old one. I have two young adult mentally retarded people with me, a woman and a man. I ask the woman to drive the VW bus a ways and park it. I walk over and see with fear that she parked it so close to the edge of a cliff. One wrong move and we'd go over the edge. I realize what she did was try to park as best she could like to a curb. One wants to be as close as you can to the curb, right? I get in and very carefully pull away from the edge. Now I drive us down the steep hill and on. I say I wonder if this is the road to M City. It doesn't seem right. I see a small town, really just a cluster of buildings ahead. We'll ask directions. I get out and see a small store, but it is a ghost town and no one around. Then a car drives up. I am glad and walk over and ask the woman getting out of the passenger side if she can tell me how to get to M City. She is holding a rifle, I suddenly notice, and there are blood spots on her hands. She looks at me startled and mean. I get scared. I ask her again and she says, "I'll tell you but first you have to come up to the house." Well, there's no way I'm going to do that. She'll kill me, thinking I'm a witness to something. I agree, though and get in the VW bus and drive away. Only the man that was with her is in my way on a bicycle in the road. I follow him for a short distance. I see some highway signs and try to read them One says F. Ridge. Hwy. 50. There is a corner building and the man stops there and so do I. I walk up to a man and shake his hand. He introduces himself as Doug, the insurance man. I ask him where those roads lead to. He says to the coast. Now I realize I am going back to E City and after all this trouble, if I want to go to M City, I must start all over again. I am frustrated. (611 words)

I am watching in a sex therapist Doctor's office. A woman comes in and is naked and semi-lies on the examining table. The Doctor without a word gets on her and makes love to her. It is hot and heavy. Then she leaves. Later she returns, a few minutes later, and they repeat the procedure. Each time she takes the position of pulling her legs up near her head. It is quite mechanical and I am amazed at the Doctor's performances on command. Now another woman comes in naked with big breasts. He lays her on the couch and plays with her breasts and it is all very exciting. I feel great sexual excitement, but no orgasm. (117 words)

I am in a kitchen and notice the piled up dishes and mess. I feel bad. I haven't cleaned up for years. Howard probably is tired of that. I try to do some dishes and find a pretty cobalt blue pitcher where the handle and the spout are on the edge seams of the square corners. It's really cute. It has the words "Howard's Place" printed on it in white ink. Now I can't get the kitchen faucets to close down no matter how I turn them. I finally ask Howard how to do it. He is in the bathroom showering and I knock on the door. He calls out how. I do it. Then I go into another kitchen; more mess. I sigh. I must have not done a thing for a long time. I feel sorry for poor Howard, living in these conditions. I feel energy to clean and start in. [BL] (153 words)

I am lying in a big double bed with maroon colored sheets and I am tired and want to sleep way into the morning. Some other person, male, is in the bed too, at the other side and they want to get up. I resist getting up. Then I am having throat spasms and the hospital crew don't know how to help me and I can't talk to them to tell them to give me cortisone. I am angry at them.

I am upset with myself because for years I'd been taking a few classes here and there and often not finishing them or doing the work. I have a long string of incompletes on my transcript. I am wishing now that I had chosen a 2-year master's program and just focused on that and done it. I'd have something by now if I'd done that. Some how this has to do with moving to a new city to turn over a new leaf, many years ago. The feeling is that in some other dream I had moved to a city to start school. Now in this dream I'm at the other end. So I try to do some homework and now I go to the school office to pay my tuition and fill out papers. The secretary is busy and I watch a mentally retarded girl lean over the counter, laying on it in my way, so I walk to the right and catch a secretary's attention. She asks for $56. I hand her a sealed envelope with my tuition in it. I thought it was to be $53. She opens it and pulls out a piece of paper where I had drawn pictures. I look at it and am surprised to see many different pictures of my cat in different poses and postures. I thought I'd only done one. I point out the empty spot where the mentally retarded girl had blocked my way. The secretary says, "That's a cold spot." I say yes, because that's the feeling I got from it. [BL] (263 words)

I am in a M City school building. I am looking for the bathroom. I find it and go in. I see there are no handicapped stalls. I either stand up and pee into a basket, or I walk into the toilet area and use a stall. I choose to walk in. It doesn't hurt, and I am surprised. I walk from one stall to another looking for the right one. Some are filled already with people, some aren't flushed and some are too low to the ground. I find one I think will work and go in. I pee, and as I get up, I see blood, even under the toilet, like it had poured out or leaked out. I am a bit concerned, but not too much. I notice I feel a cramp in my belly, like when I'm having periods. I decide I must have started having periods again, after so many years. A man comes up and a nurse and they want to check me over. They walk me to the blood lab area to do some tests. Either it's a period or I am sick sand hemorrhaging. (192 words)

I am at some big college-like school. Some of the women students have stolen a recently dead man's corpse and are playing with it, doing some silly witch-like rituals over it for fun. I and a woman friend are shocked to see this (in the gym). After they are done, the audience is leaving and so are we. I say to my friend, "Come on, let's follow and see if we can retrieve the corpse and take it back where it belongs." My friend is in agreement and is surprised I cared enough to do this. We figured the element of surprise will be with us, because we are so quick to go to where I am sure they are going to leave it, namely in the sorority lunch room activity center area. I search and search, in drawers, opening doors, etc. and finally find a box which it might be in. I pick it up and sneak off to find the male professor that it goes to. I go down the halls hoping to remember his name. I find a college of his and ask to talk to him. I begin to wonder just who I can trust here. [BL] (200 words)

The first moment I laid eyes on this white, large, two-story house, I loved it. The woman who owns it says she'll sell it to me and I can move in right now and we'll do the papers later. I and my daughters start to move in. Each can have their own bedroom, the outside lawn is spacious and pretty, the rooms large and comfortable. I begin to be concerned because I haven't even asked how much for the house and if I will qualify for a bank loan for that amount. I am tired of living in my cramped little house, but it was the best I could afford. This will be much more. I see the short, almost midget-sized woman who owns it and go to her. I say, "I want to talk about the details before I get all moved in and then have to leave." She is busy driving a tractor towing a cart and I follow her, talking all the while. She smiles and wants to know what that other woman said about her. I say, "Nothing much." I didn't really listen. She says, "Good. Don't worry. We'll make a deal." She wants me to have the house.

I am on the sidewalk in a crowd. A parade of some kind is about to happen. As I start to work my way through the crowd to get to the curb edge to see better, an Eastern Indian man in a white diaper-like thing dashes past me and shoves his way past me. I notice with some negative shuttering that he only has one leg. He bounces on a table and then takes off. Later, some people are accusing me of something and need to know where I was. I describe in detail where I stood, the man and what he looked like. My witness is Lucy, a blind woman, who had smelled him and that was good enough. They believed us. (123 words)

I am at some work-related meeting and have discovered that some organization needs to be done. It had been done in the past and now it hasn't been done for a while. I decide to go ahead and do it right then and there and work up some name and address sheets and a newsletter and so on so things can get going again. It was pretty easy to do. Now I go home (not familiar). Bonnie is there and Angel is outside. I am organizing piles of things: candies, utensils, toothpicks, that were in purses. I go out to see how Angel is doing and see an island where a friend lives. There is wilderness all around the island, except for the part facing my house. I start to try and figure out how to get over there. I am stopped by a group of men who are now sitting around a circle, squatted, only they are suited gangster types. I whisper to Bonnie, "I'll bet they are gangsters." She says she'll bet a Real Lean Dollar and 5 cents that they aren't. One comes up to me and asks if I am one of the Simply Four, a gangster group. I laugh and say no, but somehow this proves they are of that group. I say I am B. They have heard of me. I am now on the island and notice it is very tiny, a sand spit really, with the tamest creek going around it and a stone walk to the almost park-like "wilderness " in the back. I am a bit disappointed. (267 words)

I am sleeping on an uncomfortable hide-a-bed in a room where the floor is dirt and a rectangular shallow hole with straw in it is the area for the bed/couch. I wake up and see Howard standing near the bed on the right. He is very sad and I realize he has had enough and will ask for a divorce from me. I feel sad and a bit bad about my treatment of him. I look down on the floor and see about 6 inches of water there, and floating in it is my hand-held tape recorder and a couple of other small electronic items. I am very upset as I pick it up and see it is warped and broken. I blame Ellie or her children. I get out of bed and feel terrible. The place is a mess. The babies are fussy. Now I and a woman friend decide to drive to town. As we are driving through a building, a man screams for help. The floor of a business has given out under him. The older pudgy owner of the business rushes over to pull him out. Now our way out of the building is blocked. I am concerned. What shall we do? The woman points to a bank with an elevator. We are, I see, on the 20th floor. I go back to the owner and call him out. He is quite agitated and confused and I apologize for disturbing him, but does he know another way out? He describes the building next door and this or that office and to turn there. I ask my friend if she knows that way. Then I am concerned how if I leave the van, will I be able to get home? It's too far to walk. Somehow I get home and another woman roommate is around. There is some information about a model who types, or a type model, and I am curious and would like to go find her and meet her. My roommate is also interested. (340 words)

I am in a large gym. A band is playing. I see Hojo on the drums. I admire the large biceps of his arms. I didn't know he played drums. Maybe I'll rethink how I feel about him. I've always wanted to be in relationship with a drummer. Now a play is going on and Hojo is in that too. I am way off in a corner of the gym, even away from the audience area, all alone. I am trying to be quiet and inconspicuous, but the players come over to my corner and a woman in a bride's dress is acting and I join in to help her. Now I'm off to the side and the play is over. Hojo comes over and I stand and then sit as we talk. Some man is talking about playwriting and I can't help myself. I chime in and say, "Well, I write plays and I find that when you write for someone else it isn't your best work. It doesn't come from the heart and soul." Then Hojo says, "I didn't know I was taller than you. Stand up again." I don't, because it would hurt. (196 words)

I take the package from Mr. Clinton and walk over to the group and hand it to someone. This goes on for awhile. Now it's over and I am going to go teach a class at elementary school. I walk through one classroom where they have no furniture; they sit on the floor. I see a man and say to a friend that I am interested in having a relationship with him. I go on. She tells him what I said. He thinks it over and then follows me into my classroom. He, I realize now, is slightly retarded or slow. I wonder about my choice. I am resetting the heater.

I am in some kind of hospital or nursing home. A woman dies during the night. Some of us feel sorry for her because she died alone, no friends or family. So we bury her (in her urn) with a jar of M & M's for company. The next morning some people found out and are very upset with us, thinking we were just playing a crude prank. I am explaining to a young man why we did it. I begin to cry and he holds me in his arms soothingly. I say, "This will be hard for you to understand because you are young, in your early to mid-twenties, but I am 53 and much closer to the end of the conveyor belt of life than you are and death scares me. You hardly even think of it." He is supportive and sympathetic. (144 words)

I am exhausted. The little girl, like Charla, is finally asleep. I am sitting in a wooden chair next to her. Ellie is holding her hand, trying to help her get to sleep. I nod to Ellie sleepily. She asks me something, and I nod, but I didn't really hear what she said. She leaves. I look up and see a glass cage with a monkey that looks like a cat in it, under water, breathing quite happily and content in the water. A water bottle for animals is in there and it sucks on the straw for the liquid food. I think it's cute and am amazed it can breathe under water. However, we have to be vigilant because when it is night time and it is sleepy, we have to move it to the regular metal cage so it can breathe air, or it will drown during its sleep. That is sort of Ellie's job. Now I am asleep and Ellie is trying to wake me up. She shakes me and I struggle to wake up. I mumble something and she says in a most appreciative voice, "Thanks, Mom, for letting me have sex," meaning she had asked my permission to go off with this guy and have sex, only I felt a bit strange, because I hadn't actually heard the request. "Oh, well," I think, "what's the harm?" I nod and go back to sleep. She moves another wooden chair over to put my feet on so I can sleep more comfortably. (255 words)

A man and I are traveling together. I have a gig to do at a bar in this motel, restaurant place. We get a free room as part of the pay. We go in to see the room. It is a rundown place, ugly green colors with paint peeling and so on. I open a door and it leads into the bar area where I will be working. The tables are red troughs where plates of spaghetti are sitting, left over from other people. We walk around in a circle which takes us to the front cafe area and then back into the more fancy restaurant area and then back into the motel part. I open another door to find the bedroom. It is more the size of a closet, a single bed and nothing much else in it. The walls are so thin that we hear another man in the bathroom. It is noisy. The man and I laugh. We go into another room, the kitchen. There are many cabinets. I am surprised. I wonder what's in them. I see a whole row of stoves. I turn one on. It's a gas stove and two burners flame on. I try to turn it off and can't get it to completely turn off. The flames go out, but I can hear the hissing of gas. I try harder. The man helps. The knob breaks off. I say, "Oh well, I don't smell gas. It must be all right. Now we look in the cabinets. There are many packets of food things, small cereal boxes and so on. I see a huge honey bear bottle of maple syrup. Well, that's the first thing that seems nice about this place. Then a tiny man (sort of the size of a leprechaun) comes in and tells us, on the sly, that we'd have to pay a quarter for any of this food if we eat it. What a rip. I get down on bended knee and say to the tiny man, "Thank you. You are a kind and sweet person to warn us, even though you could get in trouble because you work here." Even though all the aspects of this trip are lousy, the man and I like each other and find amusement in all the adversity. After all, it's a free room. (391 words)

Turtles come up on shore, by the motel I am staying at. I don't like the people that are staying here. They are secretive and are behind closed doors. I try to meet them and they slide away. I am walking around looking for someone to connect with and talk to. I see the turtles laying their eggs, that are really little transparent, snail-like things. A bunch of large beetle-like bugs come out and go to the babies and begin to latch onto them. At first I think this is a ritual where a symbiotic thing happens to help the babies. But then I realize the babies are being eaten. I feel sick. I try to walk and everywhere there are slimy, nasty bugs and things and I must step very carefully. I try to put shoes on to protect my feet so I won't feel them. I feel sad for the babies. (153 words)

She creates a large board and puts (in this case) pictures she drew of walls because she's writing a book about horse things you can put on walls. As we talk, I say to Leighanne, "We are essentially equals." But I feel hesitant like maybe she's better than me. She kind of smiles. (89 words)

I am an English 101 teacher. I walk into my first class of the day, a noon class. I am walking and fairly good-looking in a knit dress. It is a medium-sized class. I start talking about how this won't be a boring grammar class. We'll do the interesting and beautiful part, literature. One young woman asks me if it's the same hours to take a science class. I explain how it takes more hours for science because it's a lab class. Now the class is over and I need to find a bathroom and go pee before my 1:00 class, only it is 1:00 already. I hurriedly walk down the block, passing up the school building because it may take more time to find the bathroom. I see a man from my class and he says he's going to find a bathroom and goes into an agency. I follow him in and ask for the ladies room. The clerk (male) is a bit upset. This isn't a public bathroom, but I point out my need and he agrees. I open the door to find a meeting going on. I change my mind and walk back down the hall. I see another of my students in a room. This agency works with brain damaged people. I decide I'm too late for my class and must just hold it in and hope for the best. I go to my class to find it overflowing with students. A male teacher had been monitoring them for me. I apologize to them and to him explaining I had to pee and couldn't find an accessible bathroom. They are so hard to find. He leaves and I begin my intro. I say, "I am Barb Sanders." I hear different students talking all at once. I pause and wait. I hear several of them shushing each other. Some are asking me what kind of a name is B. I thank them for the attempt to self-monitor. I explain how I came to be called B. (339 words)

I am on a beach and the children are going to swim in the water. I see big slabs of rock out in the water. I decide to go swimming with them. I go in, fully clothed, including my jacket. I wade around and see a bald baby, its bonnet down on its neck. I play with him, floating him around in the water. I had told the children I wasn't going out deep, because I didn't want to get my jacket wet, but when playing with the baby, I lie down in the water and get soaked. The water is cold. (102 words)

I'm in some kind of a class and two woman sit on either side of me. One woman says rather haughtily, "We never spend time together except in class." It's kind of a dare. So I say, "OK, let's do it now." We are going for a drive. I am driving. As we approach a hill, I see an asphalt driveway and a long parked car. I begin to go up the dirt road up the hill past the car and then I stop and say, "No, we had trouble doing this the last time. Let's try the short cut." I back up to go over the asphalt pathway. I see a tiny car with odd wheels that flop around in a strange circular motion like it's swimming. It goes past. Then I hesitate and say, "We can't go this way." The woman is talking about her novel and her ex-husband and a platform. I say testily, "I'm tired of hearing about your ex-husband and the platform (sort of a novel she wrote)." She says I should use the asphalt path. I sigh and look again. I think my front wheels will lock under the lip of the entry and will be stopped. But I try again and my wheels pop over the lip and we're off. I feel a little embarrassed. (222 words)

I am making art things. My "dad" comes along and looks at it and says "Hey, that's all I get, a silly necklace around my neck and this?" He's referring to the picture I drew to represent my feelings for him. He's in blue and pink and some kind of neck band thing, holding another picture. I am hurt and say to him, "You are insulting me and my art." I walk away from him, feeling sad. I look again at the picture. I had good reason to draw it this way. I stand by my artistic decisions.

I am all dressed up in a lovely gown, waiting for my date to arrive. There are children and Melinda in the room. My young man comes to the door. I am excited and pleased. He is very good-looking and well groomed and dressed. I go to the coat closet to get a coat. I am taking special pains to dress socially acceptable as opposed to my usual bid for comfort before fashion style. I pick a coat and realize it is Melinda's. She s miles her consent at me. I put it on. A scarf goes with it, very 1950's in style. We leave, feeling happy. (107 words)

A woman with a manly hairstyle and a thick, muscular body is trying to kill my sister Lydia. The woman wants a box that Lydia has. The contents are valuable. I don't know what it is. There is a conspiracy going on between Lydia's husband and the woman and her husband to get the box and kill Lydia. I try to snatch the box and the woman is coming toward Lydia. I step in between them. The woman laughs and warns me to stay out of it or I will be killed. I say, "I can't let you hurt my sister." I have to try. We struggle. I yell out to a blind woman like Becky to break the windows and unlock the doors. She slowly walks toward the window, being very inept and saying testily she wasn't being inept. I manage to capture the woman, yelling to someone to help me hold onto her. I manage to get her handcuffed. She is a tricky, wily woman. I smash through the glass panes of the door windows and I pull her outdoors and down the country village road. I call out, "Where's the sheriff's office?" No one is helping. The sheriff, a pleasant-looking young man, saunters up and asks what I want. I am desperately holding on to this almost escaping woman and explaining the situation. I realize that while we are talking, her husband is cleaning the broken glass panes I shattered to get out of the house and they are setting me up to look like I am harming them. (262 words)

I am watching a woman being prepared for execution, because after they kill her, it's my turn to be executed. They rest her chin on a pile of white pillows. She is standing. I feel the fear and the cold, clammy certainty of my own upcoming death. There is nothing I can do. It is inevitable (56 words)

First there is a war going on. I wear a helmet and a bullet hits me on the top of my helmet as I am lying down in a crouched position. I pick up the spent bullet for a souvenir. I was lucky and the bullet didn't harm me. Now Jennifer H is very sad. Her girlfriend is going to commit suicide. She will drink poison and die. A woman like Katrina is there. I drink the poison too. I am afraid and yet calm. My death is certain now. It's a weird thought that my life is ending NOW. I lie down. I notice Jennifer sitting on the floor near her girlfriend. The girlfriend is in the last throes, gasping and all bound up like in a cocoon or shroud. She turns her face toward Jennifer to say something to her. Her face is contorted. She changes her mind because it's too exhausting to struggle against the enclosing death. I realize I am nearly at that stage now, my poison worked faster than hers. I suddenly think of my girls and how sad I won't be there to watch them grow up. I ask Katrina for paper and pen to write my last wishes. I think of my girls, then I think of my women's group friends and then I look at some of my writing (on yellow legal pad paper) and say, "Well, some of this was pretty good." It seems so strange that I am about to be nonexistent, inconceivable. (253 words)

I am at some kind of convention. I seem to be always late for breakfast. I hear a speech and then go in to the food area to see if there's any leftovers. I find biscuits and so on and begin to snack. I see a woman and sit beside her. I realize it is Princess Di. She speaks in a very soft voice and the radio is playing very loudly. I say, "Just a minute. I have to turn the radio off. I can't hear you." I see two or three radios. I try to turn them off. Which one is it? Another woman is trying to help me. It doesn't work. Now I am in another room. Kids' books are laid out for us to peruse. A man is talking about gun control and how toys and games are inspected for safety features more than guns are. It's a lecture. It's a loud radio newscaster kind of voice. I decide spontaneously to walk for awhile. I start walking up a road, up a hill, and notice I am barefooted. A small girl, maybe 8 or 9 years old, walks with me. I wonder if we can make it barefooted. The gravel spots could be painful. Then I remember I didn't bother to tell anyone where I or the girl was going. They may be worried. Now I'm in a room and a male is telling a sports story about the Raiders. (243 words)

I am seated and a man in a blue patterned flannel shirt comes over and sits next to me. He is sweet and loving and attracted to me. He is gentle. I am attracted to him as well, even though I critically notice that he is slightly pudgy and my age, but still a nice looking man. We sit very close. He puts his arm around me and we are physically very aware of each other. It is very sensual. We like being close together. (85 words)

I have returned to the community college C. department to work a bit. Jerome comes over and asks me if I would be a "P." I say, "I've been gone so long I don't have any idea how things work now. What does a 'P' do? Do they still do registration and center coverage? And office hours?" He says yes. I want to be conciliatory and obliging, so I agree to be a "P." I notice Jerome's eyes look odd, sort of big with wrinkles around them. He is standing at my desk and I go near his desk. He says to me, "Are you intending to use my desk or yours?" I again am aware of wanting to be obliging and say, "Oh, my desk, of course. It would be silly to change desks since yours is already set up." Then I feel uneasy, wondering if this is a part-time job or a full-time one. I hope it is only part-time. (162 words)

I am in a hospital as a patient. I think I am having surgery. A man friend of mine, like Paul of acting class, also has surgery. I suddenly remember it's been days since he went for surgery and I had forgotten to check in on how he did. I start going through the halls of the hospital asking different nurses where I can find out how he's doing and what room he's in now. They are not helpful. I keep trying. I now have to pee and go to a bathroom. I see a woman is in there, so I am by the door waiting. The woman comes out, but another one pops in ahead of me. I am annoyed and say, "Hey. It was my turn. I was waiting here." I see several other women now trying to get ahead of me. One woman left her things on the toilet, a cosmetic bag and so on. Now I am out of my wheelchair and standing so I can muscle my way in if I have to. (178 words)

I am moving from a many-roomed house. There are back rooms I've not even been in. The moving is becoming more and more disorganized. Now people are picking up things and taking them outside, not even in boxes, and sitting them out there. I don't even have the truck thing set up to take things to the new place. I ask someone, maybe my father, to wait and let's get things organized before it starts raining and ruining everything. Now I am supposed to move to the water world of my lover. I put on the bride dress and then Dovre, my daughter, helps me wrap up good so I'll stay warm and dry in the transition, with many layers of black, warm cloth wrapped around my legs and so on, a stocking hat on my head. I come out and my lover sees me, the king of the water world. He is a bit upset to see me so plain and ugly dressed. He discreetly leaves into a building to wait as Dovre helps me unwrap. I am aware that I am supposedly underwater, yet there are bright-colored flowers on the hillside and I can breathe just fine. I get unwrapped down to the bride dress and I call out to my lover that he can come out and greet me. (222 words)

I am trying to walk up some stairs that aren't even finished being built yet. I realize how futile and hard this is, so I go back down and find an "elevator" which is simply a pull chain as I stand on a wooden floor. The mechanism goes down and I see the inner structure of the basement floors go by as I stand there unprotected. I am a bit nervous, wondering if it has a stopping mechanism or if I'll just plow into the floor when I get there. It does have a stopping mechanism and I step off and find myself in a basement, a BIG basement. I am tired and lie down on the floor, with my head resting on a sack of some kind. I see a kitten and then another and then groups of them curled up on shelves and sacks of things. They are all adorable and most are calico. One of them, a half-grown one, sits on my chest and wants to be petted. I pet her, happily. One small baby one nibbles on my ear and I tell it to stop. Now four or five men come in and stop and see me. They are young and muscular and good-looking. One is in a power wheelchair. He smiles at me. They are here to pleasure me sexually. I lie passively where I am and then feel one of them near me. I turn my head and am happy to see he is very beautiful, Mexican, I think, because of his thick black hair and his warm brown eyes. I exclaim, pleased, "You are so very good-looking." He smiles, pleased. His skin is covered with a shiny coconut oil substance. I curl up to him and begin sensually kissing him all over his chest and so on. He begins to expertly wriggle his penis into me. It is very erotic and exciting. (319 words)

I am sitting somewhere with a young, good-looking man. I love him deeply and I feel he loves me too. But he is a homeless vagabond and resists the idea of surrender to love. At first he is kissing me and I am resisting. He says, "When did you ever water-ski?" and I say, "Before the arthritis, about 19 years old." He is surprised and very happy. Then I have a chance, he says. By this he means that he still has a chance not only to kindle my love, but to bring me the best ecstasy and sexual pleasure I've ever experienced, because I was so young and inexperienced when I came down with arthritis. Now he and I and a younger boy are walking through a park. I see a grassy area with cement picnic tables and an indoors area with lots of round tables. I decide to sit in the room. I go from table to table, which at first look empty, but as I get there, I'll see a sweater and purse or books. Someone is saving the table. So we go outside. I am standing very close to him. It is exquisite torture for the both of us. I turn my face and kiss him on the cheek. He pulls back sharply, like any little thing will make him cave in emotionally and he'll succumb to the loving feelings. Finally, I get up and say, "Look, I've done all I can. If you want me, you'll come and find me," and I walk away from him, ready to give him up entirely. I have to for my own peace of mind. (276 words)

I have some author's original manuscript, written by hand. It is a bulky, loose-paged thing in a folder. I try to get into it, but it is so boring. Finally, I start passing up chunks of the book. I tell Ginny that I have to scan the thing just to find out how it ends, once I've started a book. She laughs gently at me. I decide, what the heck, and go straight to the last two pages. I pick up the manuscript and carry it into the next room where Ernie is seated at a table, desk-like thing, which has rainbow colors on it, and there isn't another thing in the room or on the desk. I put it next to him and joke, "Maybe you want to read it." I go into another room where Ginny brings me a two-book set from a bookstore that she thought I'd be interested in, a sci-fi book, maybe Ursula Le Guin. I open it up and the words sparkle and sort of look like those colorful hologram pictures. They are energetic, colorful, moving pictures only on the words that have that kind of meaning. I like the books and wonder how much they cost. I try to read the cardboard display. Maybe they are $10.20 each. (215 words)

I am at the community college again, wondering if they have part-time jobs for counselors. Andrea says maybe in a few years. I am now walking with Jim (dean of something). He likes me and I am distracted a bit. He is showing me some cute things for sale in the community college store. He tries to interest me in looking at things. I realize this is his way of helping us be closer, so I try. He shows me a small ceramic footprint which, when you open it up, is filled with sand. I see a candlestick, black and slim with ceramic cats on it. It is very cute. I am trying to see the prices. Some of the more ornate ones are two or three hundred dollars. The slim one is maybe $10.00. He wants me to go have a salad and sandwich with him at the cafeteria. I feel kind of interested, but not supercharged. (158 words)

I am seated on a bench on a porch with a man and we are talking. There are other people strolling around, some women being catty about me. Another man sits by me on the swing. Someone is showing a video of a famous celebrity talking about E City. I say "Oh, I love E City. I describe the scene to the man by me. I tell him this is an arts fair (Saturday market). He admires what fun we seem to be having and how progressive. Then a road that leads to the ocean. I am puzzled and say, "We don't have an ocean at E City. Maybe this is someplace else." Now I am going down the road and see the waves. As I round the corner, I see it's a wide river with big boats causing the waves. I say "Oh, this is the big river, the W. In Dover." We go down by the river and I point out the newly built modern bridge. I get upset being so close to the churning water and say, "We have to go back up to the road. I get scared near deep water." I try to crawl up through a grate-covered hole. He is wanting to explore the bridge more and moves his grate so it covers my entrance hole. I say, "Help me please." He then pulls me up by the arm, concerned not to hurt me. I make it up and then say "OK, now we can explore the bridge." (254 words)

I am a pregnant woman. I am in labor, only it's too soon and will take a long time. One man is supposed to come to the woods where I am alone, or at least I think I am alone, but the dream insists on adding lots of other people, and I wave my hands at them to make them go away, but they don't. I am annoyed. I want to be isolated and this one man is connected with me. But the dream simply has lots of people hanging out in the same woods. (95 words)

I am in a writing class. It is the end of the term and I am packing my stuff away, but wondering if I should keep some of my things there for next term; only will we use the same room? But it's a lot of stuff to carry away. I decide to take it and I go to my new home, which is an isolated spot far from anyone. I have a door and a room, but somehow no walls on the back side of the room. Or if there is a wall, it is miles away with black emptiness there. There is one more room and I look in it, but it belongs to someone else. I look out a window and the barren fields go forever. I move in the two or three jukebox-like machines with neon tube lights all over them. A man I like comes to the door and I invite him in. I show him the place and we look out the window and see a another large window out there with my different arrowheads and artifacts lined up in a row. I point to one and say, "It's the turtle man design," The man I like finds them all strange and kind of laughs at me, but then there are three other men there, bad men. One is a 400-pound Sumo wrestler type and one is the boss, named Larry. Larry tells the wrestler to get me. I fight him off, punching and trying to kick his balls, but I don't try hard enough and he's going to kill me, so I tell him or maybe I told the man I like earlier that I had karate to protect me. I move into an all-out kill-or-be-killed mode and nail him good. I am furious with Larry and tell him I will never write for him again. He had put me in jeopardy. He laughs and then leans up against the window, and at that moment the nuclear whatever that was out there explodes and he is crisped. I remember the startled look on his face as he realized he was about to die. I run to the door jamb and stand there, and supposedly this protects me enough that they all die, but I live. But I don't completely believe it even in the dream because with that massive a nuclear explosion so close, I couldn't survive. (404 words)

There is a fair setting up across the street from my house. The Ferris wheel is set up first and will run for two days before the rest of the fair is set up. I go over and meet a man who is sort of an agent or associate of the man who runs the Ferris wheel. He and I talk and it is clear that I write and he does, and he is interested in maybe marketing stuff. I get on the Ferris wheel with Boomer the cat in my arms. We start going up and the cat gets scared and I wonder if this was such a good idea. I notice I'm not scared by the height, which I usually am. Then I turn my body more so I face full front and we keep going up and I get scared too. I hang on to Boomer hard, hoping he won't scratch me badly, and soothe him. We go around and around and then it stops and I get off. The man who runs it is interested in me and the agent comes over to tell me the other man would like to have a date with me after the fair closes. I say, "But how old is he?" The agent says, "30 or so." I say, "Well, does he know I am much older? I'm 53." He smiles and says he knows but it's OK. He lives with his mother, and besides, he likes that I am a writer. We can talk about writing. I hesitate and then say OK. I walk home now to wait, but am very aware of how tired I feel and how I would rather go to bed and sleep than wait up to go out late at night. Now I see a woman who is the mother of a young woman. I say hi and we talk. She is interested in writing too. I tell her she reminds me of a vegetable. She has a green cast to her pudgy face. This does not sit well with her. She is insulted and tells me she doesn't appreciate being compared to a vegetable. I try to explain myself saying it was a compliment and I didn't mean any particular vegetable. I didn't mean a tomato or a potato (I have trouble deciding which pronunciation I should use, like that song "You say tomato, I say tomato"). I list carrot as well, saying I think the carrot is a fine vegetable. But I know inside I am not complimenting her. Her writing is stodgy, no energy, unthinking, like a vegetable. Now I hear a very annoying sound and look over to see her younger daughter flicking her finger tips and nails together over some food thing. The mother is nagging her to stop and doing the same thing. The young woman who is my friend sits between them, quite distressed and powerless at stopping these two from their power plays. I feel sorry for the young woman and want to help. (508 words)

I am standing, holding a sick boy in my arms. He is a cute tow head boy about 6 years old. He is so sleepy that he curls up in a fetal ball position over my arm as I try and hold him around the waist. Then I pull him gently to standing and he is still sleeping, all draped over my arms. Now I feel some wet and gooey substance on my foot and think he's thrown up on me. But when I look, it is some food he had in his hand, like noodles or something, that fell out of his relaxed hand. I think he's sick and maybe has an ear infection. I carry him to a bed and put him down, covering him up with a sleeping bag. He seems quite willing to lay there and sleep. It's good for him and he knows it. Now there is a windstorm and I am in a rowboat or walking across a raised bar across a large body of water. I cross it to the other side to investigate it. The boy is there and people keep shooing him back for his own safety and yet he must go there for his better health. They don't understand that. So we cross back over the bar and some man is saying the winds are increasing. I wonder if the car we are in will be swept off the bar and into the churning water, but that doesn't happen. We get to the other side. (255 words)

I am setting the table which has an under box with dirt in it and a metal top like an old kitchen table I used to have. I have planted seeds in the dirt and I notice the plants are beginning to grow -- beans, corn, and so on. I am very impressed because I realize the plants had to have bored a hole through the metal to be there. I peek under and see that is so. Then the plants aren't plants but little boxes with labels on them to say what herbs or lotions are in them. They grow in groups of two or threes. I set a table setting on one edge and a glass of milk with a straw in it. This will be my place. Some people are helping me move stuff into the area. They hang clothes on a wire or string over the couch by the table, but the dresses are too long so I tell them to hang those across the table edge where my place setting is, knowing that will cover over my place. Now the dresses are dream images being hung up like pictures on paper. A row of people are at each edge of the table, like a square circle. It's a dream group and they are asking me about my dream images. I start to enthusiastically tell them of the fascinating dream where these dog and wolf images were in, but one interrupts me with a story about a dream of mine he remembers with those images in it, only the picture he shows me is the animals on the side of the road, injured or dead. I try to tell him that's the wrong dream, but he won't listen. Then there's another question, and I answer saying proudly that I hope someday to create a dream center here, and they interrupt me talking and talking. No one is listening to me at all. I feel frustrated. (329 words)

I am talking to a man who owns a turquoise '55 Chevy that drives like a boat. It's a convertible and when you are in the driver's side, it has a rectangular piece with a forward and a backward gear lever. I start to drive it and catch on very quickly how to drive it. I go fast and laugh, thinking maybe the man is worried I might not be able to handle it. It is fun. Now I am inside some man's house. The car man is with me. I like him, but he isn't paying any attention to me. I hear a lot of noise and go to the back of the house. I see a stable outside and peek in. Three nuns are screaming and crying and very concerned. One of them yells one of them is having one. This means one of several different animals is giving birth now. I go back into the house, the man with me, and it's a party and I want him to dance with me and kiss me. But suddenly a huge elephant rampages through and we have to move quickly to get out of the way. We jump to the wall and squeeze between the wall and the refrigerator. We are face to face and I turn my face up, hoping he will finally kiss me. He starts getting the idea and tentatively and shyly starts to kiss me. I am very happy. Now the nuns are screaming it's the other animal giving birth. We go to the door and look. I wonder if the nun's are OK there or if we need to rescue them. (277 words)

I am firing Angel. I am on a campus, like the community college. I see some women teachers I know and stop to chat. Dovre is there. She tells me she and Paulina had invested in some children's gold, children's jewelry that is made of gold. She says they lost money. It was at 6 and now it's at 3. I say, "Don't worry. Keep it; it will raise back up in value." She keeps it in a safety deposit box in a back room. Now she and I are walking and see a booth with Archie running it. He is demonstrating Contact Improv in a small, square pool of water. He smiles at me and at Dovre. I introduce her as my daughter. He invites her to join him and he'll teach her. I laugh and say, "She won't do it." I think she will be shy and say no. She dives right in and swims underwater like a dolphin. I am surprised, pleasantly so, and say, "Ok, I love being wrong." Now Mr. Spock is there. He is wearing weird glasses that don't have a nose bridge and is two long rectangular cardboard flaps with designs on them. He and Archie are friends and Spock is excited about a class he's going to teach. He's been researching and preparing for some time. He says to Archie, "I haven't felt this good since 10 years after the wake," meaning someone he loved died and he has been miserable since. I am attracted to him and would like to have a relationship. He says, "Maybe you could help me teach the class, take a few sessions." I say, "I'd like that. I can do communication skills and my disability stuff." He says, "Then we could later co-teach it." I liked that a lot. I remember I could teach about dreams. (310 words)

I am in bed with Howard. He is lying on my left arm, which is under him. He is holding my left hand cupped in his hands very gently. He is talking to himself softly. He is looking at the many, many rows of scars from shots and blood tests. He is sorry for the pain I must endure. I feel his soft skin and like being near him. I wonder if we could forget all the pain of the past and just start over. I feel tenderness for him. He moves and the moment is over. I do not try to bring it back. (105 words)

Howard and I are moving furniture in a tiny house of mine. We are trying to make it safer and better for the babies, a baby girl and a 2-year-old boy. We put the baby girl's bedroom near us. I feel happy that Howard is there and we are working on the house. It feels right. Later a Ricardo type boy (man) is playing ice hockey. He makes some very extraordinary moves that are complicated. I am impressed. Now there is a tiny, little, furry kitten-like animal with black and white spots that was just born a few minutes ago. I wonder if I'm the mother and Howard is the father, but I realize it is an orphan. We adopt it. (121 words)

Burt Lancaster and I are talking in a room. I am asking him about some of his movies. I ask him if a particular movie, "The Stone Commander," had a script or if they ad-libbed the thing. I think they ad-libbed. He says, "No, it had a script, in fact, it had two." I am surprised. Now I am counting rows of broccoli: 10 heads to a row and 10 rows. The woman who owns the broccoli asks what I'm doing. I say, "We need these for a movie about vegetables." She say, "Oh no, this is my favorite broccoli. It's so sweet." [BL] (103 words)

I am preparing to do a performance at a meeting. The woman boss is talking and I realize I don't have my scripts with me for the play. I start looking around the office. I make a mess with all the papers I look through. As I am frantically searching, I also notice that the audience is off in another part of the room, partitioned off. If we moved ourselves into their room, we would be seen better. I check and see that there is plenty of room beyond the office partition. I wonder why we were told to do it in the office in the first place. I am worried that I can't remember the words or the sequence of things we are supposed to do. I am unhappy, and frantic.

I am late to a lecture. The audience is seated along one edge of the long l-shaped room. Several tables are in the center of the area. I go to the center one and stand there with another woman. A man, a mayor, is giving his State of the City Address. He wears cowboy boots and a big cowboy hat. As he talks passionately about the history of E City, he walks around. Sometimes he is walking around a tiny ledge up on the wall. Another time he straightens up a photo of himself which had slipped down in its frame. He later walks on a balcony and then jumps down. Later, he walks around the l-shaped room's corner to be visible to the stretched-out, oddly-spaced audience. I change my hat and handbag. Two skinny older women in silly odd-shaped cowgirl hats pop out from the back stage area to sing a song, but they are too early. They sing one note and stop suddenly, embarrassed. I like the mayor and what he is saying. I remember some of the things he was talking about and marvel at how many years ago it was that this building or park was started. (201 words)

I am lying on a bed. I consider myself an old lady, very old, but I am only my own age (53). I am dying. The bed begins to rise up into the air. I float along, rising higher and higher as well as going forward out the door and down the street. I pass the interior of a hospital, and a baby who is dying joins me. I hold the baby and talk soothingly to it. We rise up toward heaven. I am relieved. I was wondering which way I'd end up going. (94 words)

I am walking down a sidewalk and it is raining very hard. I have a black umbrella and I am enjoying this walk, even though I am dripping wet. An older woman walks with me for a while but she gives up and turns to return to her car or someplace dry. I keep on, loving the rain. Now I am walking in a lovely Swiss Alps country. I stop on the sidewalk and look around at the incredible beauty all around me: mountains, yellow Swiss houses, autumn-colored leaves on the many trees. I am in a small village. A good-looking man is in a red car in a parking lot nearby. He watches me and is entranced by my innocent appreciation of the beauty around me. I begin to walk up a very steep hillside sidewalk and he gets out of the car and follows me. It is hard to walk up this steep walkway, but I am enjoying the vigorous challenge. At the top is a huge tree, where you will not get wet. I go under the tree. The man strikes up a conversation with me and I like talking to him, but I don't really give him my full attention because everything around me is so interesting. The leaves of this tree are so thick, they make a wall. He shows me by taking my hand and rubbing it against the leaves. I am amazed. He watches me, liking the reactions I have, but wanting me to notice him. I look out a window, which is really an open square in the leaves. This tree is huge and really creates a long house. We walk on, the tree now a series of hallways with small rooms. It is a museum-like place. I peek in one room, a tiny one with a woman in it. She is conducting an experiment with magnetics or something. I am curious and go in. She tells me to lean my front against the wall. I do and the man is very close behind me. Other people come in and we are very crowded, so the man is right up against my back, pressing me into this odd feeling magnetic wall. It feels good. We go on. He asks me to join him at the Village Fair. I now realize he is interested in me and is courting me. I don't completely trust him, but we spend the afternoon at the Fair, laughing, talking, and walking around. I am attracted to him. Now it is evening. I return to where I had come from, some house or hotel. My man and another one I knew before are talking. I gather from the conversation that it was some kind of competition. The other man had dated me, so this one wanted to try and get me from him. I am deeply hurt and run from the building. The man who likes me runs after me. I run down steep hillsides, dashing around trees and I go for miles. He is in hot pursuit. I wade in a lake to cover my tracks and then swim. I am out of breath and exhausted, but keep on. I arrive at the other end of the lake and climb up a rope ladder to a second story window of my papa's house, calling out "Papa." I feel the man now climbing the rope ladder too. I desperately cry out, "NO!" and try to shake him off. He is determined to catch me to explain how I had misinterpreted the conversation. He truly does love me. I fall into my "mother's" arms gasping, "Don't let him catch me." The man gasps out, "" We had covered miles and I had kept the lead the whole way. I'd pushed myself beyond my capabilities.

Howard and I are at a beach. A high hill across the inlet has some people on it. They are throwing toy boats or planes around. One lands in the shallow water near me. I wade in and am surprised the water is so warm. Howard and I go for a wade, only it turns out not to be the ocean but a parking lot. As we walk, I tenderly touch the white shirt he is wearing. I touch the arm as a gentle way to be connected or close. It feels very nice. Now I have to go pee. We go into a public bathroom. I am surprised we are both in the same one. He says it's ok. I go to the other side of the room, still concerned about the mixed sexes in one bathroom. I pee, but the toilet is loose and wiggles around. I notice it is a galvanized metal tub I am peeing into. I wonder who will have to clean up that mess. Charla joins us and we go on with the walk. We are in a church. Howard says he'd like to go there some day. I ask what kind of church it is, and he says "scholarship" or something academic. Now we are walking down a street and some drunk and disorderly people are driving in a dangerous way toward us. Howard had been drinking beer and he started getting belligerent back at them. I walk away, deliberately calling him Jared, which upsets him, as I knew it would. He resented being compared with his father. He leans up to me and says, "I'm not the only one who has faults." I sigh and agree. "I know," I say. "I have them too." Now we are seeing a counselor. We begin to talk, to try and work out our differences. I say, "But it isn't only that. There are so many things we'd have to change." It is too much. (329 words)

We are having a serious meeting about the wording of some document. It's like the C. Department people but it isn't. I go to sleep in the middle of it, because it is so boring. They want me to agree with what they wrote, but I don't want to comment because I feel it doesn't say anything of substance. Now the meeting breaks up and a man is teasing me. We are joking and he is surprised I am fun to be around. I show them another meeting room I had prepared. They ask if there is enough room for 20 people. I say, "The room capacity is 135, I would think there would be enough room." Now I am looking at pictures in a magazine of a M City-like region with a old "Gabby Hayes" kind of man in the picture. Now I am harmonizing with some man a song that goes like this, "Whoa. The sun comes up in the morning." The harmonizing sounds very good. They are impressed. [BL] (171 words)

I am trying to become a doctor. The test is to take a bunch of letters and spell out your life experiences. I take the letters out of a box, but they are made of a sort of oatmeal-type material and easily breaks and balls up. I am also running out of letters. I am upset. I go to the teacher doctor at the front desk and breathlessly explain my situation. I so much want to perform well so I can pass the test. He watches me with interest to see how I will handle this challenge. I see some plastic letters in a sheet. I find a blue sheet of them and a teal blue one. I now have better materials and rush to continue my work. I am now making a tiny tortilla and putting refried beans on it. I fold the tortilla and put a part of an olive on it and a scrap of lettuce. I then plop a bottle of Mexican beer by the place setting, in the manner of a person who doesn't appreciate the wife role. I feel some resentment. I then put a bottle of rose-colored wine cooler next to it, for me, and then move it to the far end of the table. I try to find a pretty china dish, but none are left and I look for any plate. Now I am done and go to the teacher doctor. He smiles at the intensity I feel and the anxiety for how I did. He says, "Call upstairs and see if they graded you yet." I search for a telephone. Then I ask for the extension number, then I can't find a quarter. Then it's the wrong phone. A bemused clerk at the drugstore I'm in comes over and shows me the pay phone. It is high up on the wall. I try to put the quarter in the right slot, as there are two. I accidentally try to put in a round glass piece. I see my mistake and put in a quarter. I finally reach them upstairs and they say, "The results are in, come on up to get them." I am near tears. I race to the stairs, at first crossing an odd board on the floor that tilts to slide you on down the hall, but I am on the wrong floor. I retrace my steps and find the circular stairway. I step on the first stair, which has an odd accordion expanding set of stairs that work a bit like an escalator, except I step up each step and it carries me to the next step. My borrowed white lab coat gets caught for a moment in the device. I pull it free. The clerk already knows I passed because I had been so thorough and conscientious. I am filled with dread and anticipation. (479 words)

I am in an audience, waiting for the reception to begin. The huge cake with chocolate and white frosting on it is at the front of the room. I am seated in the front row at the far right. I notice that the cake has far too much frosting on it and is dropping as the chocolate globs drift down the sides. I want to help, so I go and scrape off the globs of frosting and try to frost the cake again. I take huge quantities of frosting off and put it on a cardboard. Then I look again and notice that I have really made a mess of this cake. There apparently hadn't been too much and I had put chocolate where the white was and so on. I feel embarrassed and I feel badly for Andrea who made the cake. She comes in and I feel compelled to apologize and explain my actions to her. She looks at me and then at the cake and is appalled. She turns and leaves the room. Her cake is ruined and she feels angry and miserable. I feel bad I accidentally made the mess, but I am also aware of a sense of revenge or satisfaction, which I try to minimize or deny. I see my mother seated at the front of the room. Another woman, younger, comes and sits next to her, rather close. My mother shifts her position to create more distance and then to my surprise she puts her arm along the back of the chair the other woman is seated in. She is careful to keep her distance and not actually make physical contact with the woman. I also notice that there are many square parts of the cake all along the front of the room in piles. It was a pretty big cake and tastes just fine. Nobody else seemed upset that the frosting wasn't perfect. (321 words)

["I have the big gun."] I am on a beach. There is some group game going on where people run toward the ocean with guns. We had been trained by the army. Off they go and I am in my wheelchair and going as fast as I can, but in the sand, it isn't fast enough. The group arrives at the shore and fire their guns. They all run out of bullets just about when I get there. I take careful aim at the big boulders out in the surf and fire one shot from a huge pistol. I blow the boulders to smithereens. It's a large explosion. Now I go back to the sand to rest and play with Charla. We are hanging out together when some man picks up our backpack, with Charla's boots in it and walks off. I call after him. He drops it. I see the boots laying in the sand. I now want to return the gun to the army but can't find any army people around. I wander around and see a rifle in the sand. I return to where Charla is. We sit and the wind picks up until the sand storm is very powerful. I hold a pink cloth, perhaps a scarf up behind Charla to protect us. Now I notice street lights going by and see that I am now riding in the back of a pickup truck. My own truck. I figure Ellie my daughter got tired of hanging out on the beach and decided to drive us home. I try to look into the cab but the glass is difficult to see through. I see the shadows of four people. Two men and two women. Some punk teens had stolen my truck. I ask one woman to stop the truck and she laughs and says, "Hey, I'm only the girlfriend." I sneer and say "Oh, That kind of a woman huh?" I turn to the ones driving and tell them to stop the truck. They laugh. So I pull out the big gun I still had and smash open the glass threatening to shoot. They pull over and get out. Charla and I get into the truck to drive away. (367 words)

["Packing the clothes."] I am in a bedroom. Charla has made a mess not putting things away and I begin to clean up. We are visiting someone's house and maybe the next day we will be returning home. I open the three bottom drawers of a dresser and start to organize things when it occurs to me to start packing early. I find many pictures Charla and I have drawn and some pages of notes for my dictionary for the software. Under all that, I find a beautiful diamond pendent with my initial "B" on it. I remember my parents gave it to me. I decide to put it on. It looks very pretty. (111 words)

["Huge waves and violent man."] I am going to an audition or returning some clothes to an office. I am walking down the sidewalk in a city. I can't remember where the agency office is. I walk over the top of a station wagon car and it starts to move. I hop off and see that Curtis S. is driving. He is looking at me coldly and I worry he thinks I'm being a weird fan trying to get close to him. I try to explain my purpose but he drives away. So I walk on. I am going from building to building and I see huge white water waves coming up from the ocean. If I take the sidewalk I think I need to, I'll be sucked out with the waves. I go around the safe way. I find a door and a woman and I ask where the office is. She is unsure but walks up a very steep carpeted flight of stairs. She signals me to go with her. I point out I can't walk stairs and I will go around. I go around and find an office. I return the clothes and start to leave. I am walking down a flight of stairs and get to the door. I open it, by twisting the entire door and shoving it out. I see then that I would be walking in wet mud flats. This isn't good, I don't like that. So I start to go back u[p the stairs, again returning the door to it's proper closed position. Now a violent man with a knife has me. He threatens to kill me if I make noise or try to escape. I am afraid and do what he says. Now I seem to be a man and he wants to know if I am an IRS agent. Later he snarls, You're a lawyer, I can smell it. I taunt him a bit by saying which is it? IRS or lawyer? Later, he startles me and I fall grabbing onto his beard. It rips off in my hand like it is grass. I quickly put it back, trying to pat it back into place. He and I suddenly laugh because he had once said to me never touch my beard. Now it seems funny. We are almost friendly. (384 words)

["Doing the right thing."] I am in an open area with several other people. This is a kingdom and the king and a woman are there. He wants me to do something and I do not want to do it because it is wrong. So I stand up and walk away, down a stairway path and around a curve and into another kingdom. The older king there likes me and he is honorable and I am honorable. There is a young man as well. And a woman like Kira of Star Trek. We do good things for the kingdom and they want me to stay but I feel the need to return to my own kingdom, and finish up what I had started. I return and they are still dishonest and I fix things and return back to the good kingdom for a visit. I try to maintain some distance with those three but end up in a bathtub (outdoors) holding hands with the old crippled king (who is in the tub with me, manual wheelchair and all) and Kira, who sits outside the tub. The young man, who I am very attracted to tries to move his face close to mine and I gently push him back and ignore him but he persists, I am happy he does. Later, Kira and I and another woman shower for a long time together we are good friends and have much to talk about to catch up on the current events of our lives. I realize I've been talking good things about the young man and he may be there in the men's shower (we are at a swimming pool.) (274 words)

["Returning to work at Community College."] I returned to work at Community College. They have moved the Disabled Student's department upstairs on the fourth floor. I walk up the stairs, wondering if I should use the elevator. But I feel strong enough to make it. I see women working there that remember me and we talk. I am led to a room off in a corner which was used for storage. It is long and narrow but has a window and a nice oak desk with pigeon holes drawers in them. I say this will be nice when we get it fixed up. The students can use that end by the door for their support groups and connecting and I can use this desk for the paper work. I come back out and start to walk down the stairs but the stairs are steep and the steps are tilted so it is dangerous to walk on it. I am wearing high heels too. So I decide to find the elevator. I find it but can't figure out what to push. There are two metal plates with words on them. One is loose and keeps moving. I walk down the stairs after all, this time with no problem. I ask someone where my wheelchair is. I had left it on the second floor. I go where it should be and a play is going on. I sit at a small round table, Angel my assistant is there. Now I see that they are filming a soap opera there and Dylan has an acting part. And Tyler and other counselors are a part of the crowd scene. Apparently they do this every day. (275 words)

["Sexy cigarettes and anger."] I am in a room, maybe a hotel area. Dovre and I are hanging out watching TV all night. We are smoking and I really am chain smoking. I finish a pack and then pick up a pack called Lily Fields or Lilac Fields. It has a pretty flower with yellow colors on the pack. Obviously cigarettes made for women. I light one up and walk to a overstuffed chair in a corner and smoke. I pull in every drag I can. It makes me feel sexually excited and warm. I pick up the pack and read the back which explains that there are Phonemes embedded in the thing so that when I read the carefully coded words I will experience a sexually warm feeling. I like it and the cigarette is short and finishes up quickly. I keep smoking until the burning ember of the end is nearly on my lips. I then walk over to the sink to put it out. The faucet doesn't work right. I move the handle to the left and to the right but it never turns it completely off. Water is squirting up from the drain. I realize I have to turn a knob to stop the water flow and do that. The stub of the cigarette is now grass green. Now I go back to the chair and sit. A nurse comes in who apparently usually does the IV into a vein in my scalp or brain. She has a whole pack of men with her and she says she has injured herself and will leave me in the care of these men who do nursing stuff in the room across the hall. I don't like this and start to tell the man exactly where the vein is and it is tender and hurts. The man is sharp and cold. He says that part of your brain is dead. It can't hurt. I am furious and walk away saying I will call my Doctor. I will not allow you to touch me. The woman nurse shows me her welted and red swollen arm and she leaves. Now I am watching as a woman comes in very drunk. She won't take the treatment. Her brother goes in and comes out saying she won't listen to us. Only to Beverley. I begin to cry, angry and upset. Some woman asks me Will I fight for her? I feel put upon and used and tired. I cry and cry. (414 words)

["Candles that won't stay lit."] I am in a big room, maybe a hotel room. Charla is there. It is a family reunion. I look on the windowsill and see some small birthday cake sized candles. I decide it would be fun to light them. I tell Charla I like new fresh candles to burn. I light one or two and then the rest seem to start to light but fizzle out very soon. I keep relighting them. I look again at the ones on the window sill and realize they are under a wood sash and that is a dangerous place to light a fire. I blow them out. Now Corinne comes in as I am packing the candles up and cleaning the place in preparation for joining the family reunion, I ask Corinne who all is coming this year. My father comes in and mentions that later they are going to the radio station to hear "Gulliver's travels" being read. I say I wouldn't mind going there with you. He is surprised and says I didn't know you got that station at your place. I say I don't. I'm not interested in the content. I just am curious about how a radio station works. Then I change my mind and think it would be boring to go there. (215 words)

["The Rabbit Man."] I am in a bank. I want to deposit some money. I pull out the papers from my bag and see that it is very complex. I have to finish a needlepoint canvas they gave me before I can do the deposit. I am rushed for time and decide to wait for another day. We leave the bank, perhaps my daughters and me. They get ahead of me and I notice a man in a rabbit white face doing some street theatre. I slow down to watch. He comes up to me and kisses me. I then walk down the sidewalk and we talk. He thinks I am just a pretty girl but as I talk, he learns I am an actress, a writer, a videographer and so on. Now I turn down another street because I saw the green back of my van turn that way. I say goodbye to him. I walk a half a block and then see I was mistaken. It was some other vehicle and I return back where I was. I meet up with the Rabbit/man again. Now we are in his house in a warm room with beautiful woods used in the walls. We are taking a warm bath as there is water on the floor. We continue talking. He has a partner that joins us in conversation. I am building a big case for them using me as a professional performer and writer in their production. (244 words)

["Can't remember my Lines."] Lucy and I are driving to a gig. We pull off at the place we think the gig is supposed to be. We walk around looking for it, occasionally asking someone where it is. No one seems to know. I try to read my written instructions but it is faded and unclear. I say it must be right over there. We drive and suddenly see the freeway stops dead in it's track with a huge drop off to nowhere. We are startled and relieved we noticed it before we drove over the edge. We turn and find a place to stop. We sit down on the sidewalk to think about it. I suddenly realize I didn't rehearse or bring my scripts and desperately try to remember the ADA skit. Lucy is a bit upset with me. I say I even forgot the Evangeline hats. That really upset her. Now she wants to give up finding the place and going home. I say Katrina will be upset, what will she do? She had asked us to do this for a staff meeting. Lucy says she'll figure out something else. I want to agree but feel bad about not trying harder. I am mad at myself for not preparing better. Now a woman comes up to Lucy and sits on the sidewalk next to her. She asks if she wants a hit. I turn my head away saying no. But Lucy says yes. The woman lights up a marijuana cigarette and shares it with Lucy. But suddenly Lucy jumps up and yells get away from me. I am startled. I think that the woman made a sexual pass at Lucy.I see the woman's oddly blue-veined breast, exposed. But Lucy says "You are Sister Mary Ellen." The woman leaves and Lucy tells me in a disjointed way that she was a media victim and this woman was a part of it and she is very upset with her. Another man comes by who was a part of that time and Lucy and he talk about it. Now we agree to return home. I pick up our red car and turn it around and place it on the fast lane of the freeway back home. I tell Lucy to hurry and get in before the oncoming traffic catches up. I drive away quickly.

["Moving bathroom."] I am walking down the halls of a school, maybe a University. I am looking for a bathroom. I see classrooms and peek in, and a library, but I know I am not a student here so I can't go in, even though it looks interesting. I find a tiny room, with the word Women written vertically on the wall. I open the door and am surprised to see it is a non flush primitive bathroom. Two smelly messy holes in the ground with lids and a small metal tub on the wall. I squat over the tub and pee. It stinks in there and the room seems to be shaking and vibrating and moving sideways. I wonder if I'm in an elevator that goes sideways. I reach for the toilet paper but it is very tough and stringy like packing tape and it is very hard to break into pieces to use. I get out of there as quickly as I can. (163 words)

["Bee Sting and smelly dog shit."] I am driving down a freeway and notice the traffic is coming at me. They are going the wrong way. I pull off on the left side of the road and get out. I walk down a steep embankment to a park area, very confused. I keep looking at the traffic and saying to myself, but it should be going the other way right? I look across the park and see the other side of the freeway and the traffic is going in the same direction as the traffic on my side. This is strange. I decide I have to go to the bathroom and walk down a path. I see many piles of dog shit and the odor is strong. It is smelly shit. Lots of bees are swarmed around it and as I step over the shit, one stings me on the leg. I call out One of them stung me. Then I see the rest are hovering over and around my leg and I can't shake them. I feel some fear. I try hard to shake them off and keep moving. I finally manage to shake them away and return back to the freeway. Now I see that some cars are going the right way but it is dangerous because there is still traffic coming from the wrong direction. (222 words)

["Directing a children's play and it all goes wrong."] I have been hired by an elementary school to direct the children's play. I sit on a high shelf on the wall, with two pillows under my buns. They keep sliding because the shelf is slightly tilted toward the floor. So I fight to keep my balance. On my left sits a young student helper who keeps getting in my way. The two young actors, a girl and a boy keep doing the first few sentences over and over waiting for my directions, but I am too busy trying not to fall off my perch and I can't seem to keep the directors notebook open to the right pages. I am searching for the purple or salmon colored pages of this particular play and can't find them. I ask for help and an assistant brings me text books and copies of the script for the actors. There is a crowd of kids on the gym floor where we are rehearsing, the other class members waiting for their turn to act. Two other kids, teens, keep getting on the stage area and I ask who they are. I am told that they are helpers. So I let them stay. They are putting props on the stage. A bicycle and something else. Finally I am very uncomfortable physically on that perch and say that's it for the day. I ask a passing teacher to give me a hand down from the perch. She is reluctant, thinking it would be too much for her to do physically. The assistant comes and I tell her to stand to my left and I will slide down, using her for balance. We do that. I get into my wheelchair with a sigh of relief at being back home where it is comfortable for me. I drive through a hall and find the supply room. I request a grade book, a lesson plan book and look over the various types of stenographer tablets available. I am tired so decide to get what I need another day. I find the exit door and leave. Now I wonder if there is a bus out here, since the school is out on Highway 99. I look back at the school and notice a small apartment room on the side. I remember that Claude and his wife used to live here and for a moment I contemplate weather to visit them or not, but I am too tired. I'll do that another day. I roll on down the side of the highway and see a bus up ahead. I go there and it is a greyhound sort of bus, not a city bus. I look at the murals of trees and bill board signs they have under a long canopy as I drive by. I keep rolling, thinking at least the chair won't get tired, if I have to go all the way back without a bus. Now I see an intersection that looks familiar but only it is different than real life. It is the intersection of H. and highway 99, which doesn't really exist. I think it is odd. There is a sort of shopping mall there and big rolling hills of asphalt. I see a city bus in the distance and start toward it. A woman says you can't get there in your wheelchair. I say oh yes I can. I turn right to an accessible tunnel I remembered was there. I get to the bus, which has a very high step that requires a sort of box elevator. I am waiting for the box to come down to pick me up. The attendant seems surly and unhelpful. So I play around with the buttons which I discover send signals to the dolphins inside that power the elevator box. They are plodding along so I switch the digital signal to a Wave code, which is more jiving and jazzy. This makes the Dolphins happy. They come quickly to pick me up. But it annoys the attendant a great deal. He grumbles and I sarcastically say Oh yes. It will be on the nightly news. Maybe the Mike Douglas news show. Does Mike Douglas still have a show I ask. Yes sir, Pabst Blue Ribbon beer proudly presents me messing with the controls. OHH my!! (716 words)

["One last Fling."] I am in a room and have left two men recently who have cheated on me. The third one, Kevin Kline, is with me and I am breaking up with him. Another man, attracted to me, is near. I am sort of showing off for his benefit. I tell Kevin goodbye and then decide to walk him outside. We walk around the corner of the building and Kevin and I begin to make love, just one last time before he goes. He leans me up against the wall and I am helping him get his penis up in me. Kevin says let's go inside and find a room. I look around and see kids playing nearby and so on but I smile and say no, let's just do it here. It's too much trouble to go find a room. But Kevin insists. So we sneak into the dormitory. We peek into rooms looking for an empty one. We have done this before, and I carry a camera so I can pretend to be on a journalistic mission. We go into one room where several empty beds are there. One higher bunk does have an older woman sleeping in it. I point her out and we try to sneak back out. She wakes up, and wants to know what we are doing. So I say We heard you knew Dustin Hoffman and wanted to do an interview. She says yes, she did know him and would give us 15 minutes. I am surprised and not happy because I made up the Dustin story thinking it would be extremely unlikely she would have known him. We sigh and I pull out a notepad and randomly write down what she says not really caring. The sexual tension seems to be fading away. She says Dustin has always talked a lot. He talked all the time.

["An Angel intercedes and lovers meet."] Steve Martin is walking down a path. He is going to the military complex. A narrator is talking about how a path is taken or not taken and life changing effects take place. I see an angel, I recognize as a comedian but his face looks like Odo's of Deep Space Nine. He flies right at the oblivious Steve Martin which deflects him from his path to a side path that goes past a small university. There is snow on the ground. As he walks up the path, a woman walks toward him and as they are passing she says to him, I am a student nurse. Can I practice on you? Do you have a sprained ankle? Next, he is lying on the ground in some sort of metal casing around his chest and she is taking tests. She says she will bring him the results tomorrow. She leaves but Steve wants to see her again, as love is developing. So he follows her and finds a huge military room where troops are resting. She is seated with one of the troops. He wants to be alone with her, so he fakes a huge voice calling out orders for a parade practice. The troops groan, as they are tired, but they get up and in groups come marching past Steve waving their huge platoon placards. Each one is a shape of a mascot animal. Nearly all of them are out and Steve is wearing an odd parachute with hoses like tenticals all around himself and he is sneaking up to kiss the woman when the woman's father comes in. He is a high ranking official and demands to know what is going on. Steve tries to hide himself in a sort of rubber raft kind of thing, covering himself with those hoses and stuff. I am now looking out from that space as the officer searches all around me. (320 words)

["Healing Clouds."] I am in a house. We are moving. I am going to live with my mother. I am in her bedroom looking for things of mine I left behind when I had moved out before. One of my daughters is helping me. I look at a rack of clothes and realize they are all my mother's and none are mine. I do find one old large purse that is mine. I look at some pictures on the wall. They are hers. I see some native American artifacts and they are hers. I say to my daughter, she has the real stuff. Mine was just trinkets. I see Aunt Naomi and say I look forward to us living together. She says I'm not living with you. I'll still be in Dover. It's too hot where you will be. She is seated in an open window and I look past her to the sky and am suddenly very impressed. Huge dark clouds contrasting with bits of bright light. A storm is brewing. I say to Naomi. Look. It is so beautiful. She does not appear interested and doesn't even turn her head to look. I watch in admiration as huge clouds form and billow out at me like a movie of rapid time frames. I say to Naomi. It's just like in the movies. Huge thunder clouds rushing and growing right down at me. Then beings come out of the clouds. One, a male being, comes right in the window and I back up, afraid. He reaches for me as I am pushed back against the bed. He touches me, over my heart. I realize he is healing me and I relax, happily, to his touch. (284 words)

["Writing again."] I go into a room. I see a writing pad and remember I want to write. At first it is tedious, but I get going and it is fun again. I realize I must write thousands of pages and just keep writing. To get to the good stuff. I am now looking for more yellow pads to write on. I go into another room and I see Nate. Another man is there also, who seems supportive of me. I roll out a very long measuring tape which is at least 4 inches wide and many feet long. I make a joke and Nate and I laugh. I am carefully rolling the tape back up which I see has many pages and notes attached to the inside of it and I don't want to wrinkle them or lose them. Nate asks me to tell him what the notes say but I tell him I can't manage rolling it up neatly and reading the notes at the same time. (167 words)

["Caveman days and I fight."] I am swimming in a huge river. On the left are high rocky cliffs. On the right is an unending expanse of water. As I swim, powerfully, I see shapes passing me underneath. One looks like a body. Others are fish. I feel afraid that something will get me from underwater. In fact, something does. A sort of reptile man monster. We fight and I kill him. Now I swim quickly toward shore. The river is changing from the broad expanse to a narrow river more shallow with rapids. I find a beach and quickly run up on land and climb up a tree with many branches. I need to sleep there at night so I try to will the branches into a more accommodating shape. I manage it. Now I notice other cavemen in the tree. I am wary, but not afraid. Now a man from modern times, an scientist doing research comes by me. He offers me a dead carcass of some animal and I build a small fire in a paper cup. I roast the meat and eat it. He talks to his colleges about me. I do not speak. They observe me. I get out of the tree the next morning and walk around. A woman scientist says to me to be careful. There are more of those reptile monsters over by the cliff and they are unreachable and dangerous. One of them comes toward me and I point to the sun and make a gesture. He doesn't understand me. I am trying to say that when the sun moves this much, then 30 minutes have passed. He finally understands. The woman is impressed that he and I are communicating in a friendly manner. They want to continue researching me but I decide I must go on and continue my journey. I dive into the water and continue my swim. Only now it is a walk down a hilly path. A male narrator is telling how I walked until I found the city and a freeway which I had never seen before. I see the city ahead of me. Perhaps New York City. It still stands after all those centuries after the nuclear war. (368 words)

["The baby elephant types."] I am in a house and I am moving, or thinking of moving. I remember I have a whole wing of rooms I never go into. When I move, I'll just scoop up all the stuff and put them in boxes. They must not be needed stuff, because I never go in there. I try to remember now many miles I am from Dover. I figure out 50 miles until the interstate, then two or three hours south to Dover. I must be in the next state to the north. I figure I am about equidistant from M. and Dover. I go outside to get the mail. I walk up the lane. I see a large mailbox. Each neighbor has one too. And at each mailbox stands a large elephant. It is the elephant's job to bend the mailbox, open it and bring the mail to it's owner. I look again and our large elephant is a tiny baby one. Very cute. I wonder if he can manage the large mailbox. The mailman drives up and puts the mail in the mailbox. I watch as the tiny elephant wraps his trunk around the box and bends the pole so the box is down by the ground. He manages quite well. The mailman says and this mailbox is 5000 pounds. I am impressed. Now my sister Lydia wants to type a letter. She calls the elephant over. She types on his little side and then he goes over to the computer keyboard and using his trunk types it into the computer. But then he refuses to let me retrieve it. Now I am back in the house and Charla is preparing to go out. I ask her what she's going to do and she shrugs her shoulders. She doesn't know yet. A boy named Doug wants to meet her at 9:15 and go on the train to the zoo or someplace fun. I make the arrangements for her. Then I see Doug sitting in the living room waiting for Charla and Charla is leaving. I ask her where she's going and she says to summer camp. I'll be back in an hour. I decide to walk to Dover and then return here so I can go to M. I begin walking down the lane and then realize what a waste of energy and time that is. I'll go to M. and do the Dover thing later at a more convenient time. I walk around to the back yard. (417 words)

["How assertive are you?"] I am in a building. I am going to teach an English Composition class. It is 8 o'clock, time to start but none of the students have arrived. Even Burt Lancaster, who usually is on time. I wait a few minutes and then decide to go upstairs to the classroom and start class. If no one shows up, I will cancel the class. But at the last minute, the students show up and I teach. Now I am traveling down a road, a very straight and narrow road looking for a small town in the mountains. I don't remember it's name, but it starts with a T. Maybe Times. I guess I find it as I am now teaching a small group in assertiveness. I am in some room. I go around the circle. I ask each person what percent of their time do they behave in an assertive way. One woman says three quarters of her time. Another says not very much. One man refuses to answer. I hems and haws and says "I don't know," I get very insistent and will not go on until he answers me. Finally he grudgingly says Not too much. Then he asks me for my answer. I think and then say, Three quarters. (211 words)

["Japanese Exchange students."] Two Japanese exchange students are with me for a weekend. We are in a house and discussing what activities we could do. One of them pulls out a handful of packaged cold cuts for sandwiches. Each package is flat, has exactly enough slices in it for a sandwich. A paper china plate is in the package to look good. One package he eats very strangely. He buries his mouth in a lump of the food and gulps it down, making lots of noise. I find that curious. Now we are in a room and the room has water in it, like a lake. We are in a boat and a Japanese man is showing me a device, a square metal black thing with buttons on it. If I learn to look through it properly I can see what is under the surface of the water. At first I simply see water as we speed over it. Sparkly silver ripples. As I learn to look correctly, I see the bottom of the room under the water is covered with electronic devices, much like the one I hold. I exclaim in surprise. My "dad" is there and we agree we'd like to spend more time together. We go to Aunt Millie's apartment so we can spend the weekend together. Charla is around somewhere. (221 words)

I can walk around and function, but I run out. I try to walk downstairs to find Rochelle, but I can barely walk. I am trapped and desperately addicted to those tablets. She gives me some more and I rush back upstairs. Rochelle pushes my hand and makes me drop the bottle they are in. I desperately try to retrieve them from the floor and cut myself on the broken glass. Rochelle looks at the wound because I say there are bits of glass in it. She probes deeply and I see the muscles under the skin. I tell her to stop. She is cruelly being too thorough. I beg for more. She has cut me off. (142 words)

You put in energy and experience and knowing the right way comes out. Cary comes over to me distraught and hands me a business card. It has a picture of him and me in outline form and he is blacked out. He walks away from me toward the doorway.

["Walking from California."] I am at a V. family reunion. We are in some house. People are arriving and we are greeting each other. Then they take their food dishes into another room. I see Darcy wearing a perky beret hat. We chat surface things. I see Aunt Charlotte. Some of Dale's kids. Finally, I go to join them in the other room only to discover they have already finished eating and hardly any food is left. It is all packed up to return with them and people are saying their goodbye's. I am quite amazed. I comment that usually people would come and eat for hours and talk and linger over coffee. But everyone seems briskly intent on getting this over with. I forage around looking for some food, as I am hungry. I find a few packages in a large glass cupboard, like you see in a florist's shop. Now I am walking back home, which apparently is in my state and I apparently am in California. I am walking down a long straight country road. Sagebrush all around. I am a bit worried because I am going a new route. I am headed for L/, my state. I come to a tiny town and find a road sign. It says 44 more miles to the my state border. I decide to take a bus the rest of the way, since I am confused about the route. I have to go to the bathroom and ask a woman at the bus depot coffee counter where one is. I look around and find doors, but not one that indicates it is a restroom. She points to one behind her counter but says it's for employees. I am adamant that I must go now. I use it. It is very small and I pee into a narrow metal container screwed into the wall. I get on the bus and it is very crowded. I see some empty seats ahead of me, near the middle part of the bus and rush, like all the others are to grab one. The seats are facing long ways toward the windows. (354 words)

["Where's my meds?"] I am at work. My office is a couch in a hallway. I suddenly realize that the woman who assists me hasn't been to work for days. And therefore, I haven't been taking my daily medicine that I am supposed to take. A woman from down the hall comes over and I ask her what happened to my assistant. She says she doesn't know. It is lunch time and she invites me to go have lunch with her. We walk down the block to a small conference room. It is open to the public. I sit at the conference table and several other women come in and join us. One of the women is my assistant. I am surprised to see her and she says she will be back into work tomorrow. She takes me into another room and hands me two bottles of my liquid medicine. I drink down a small cup of the red medicine. I wonder if it was harmful not taking my medicine those last few days.

I have a Ford and I need to do some errands. I walk to the barn it is in and notice my left knee hurts very badly. I am limping and crying. Howard seems unconcerned about my pain and does not offer to help me drive. I get into the driver's seat and notice that the ford van is now just a metal frame with a steering wheel and a seat. I try to drive forward with great painful effort but am blocked by piles of boxes. I back up, trying to avoid the children's toys scattered on the floor. I turn left to drive down a steep wooden ramp. I narrowly miss more children's toys and make it outside. I am crying with the pain. (155 words)

["I smash the evil magic woman."] I am a woman in a house. Another woman is trying to feed a baby girl. I pick the baby up and feed her. She has two teeth and doesn't suck on the bottle nipple but chews it. She still manages to get the milk. The other woman is surprised. Apparently the baby girl belongs to a third woman who already has three teen kids, two girls and one boy. And then she had this baby, years later. I am sort of her. She is exhausted. She goes to a narrow cot bed and tries to lie down. She remembers she needs to set the alarm. She calls the other woman in to help her plug it in, thinking she can't reach the plug in socket. She looks again and sees it is easy to reach but she is so tired she lets the other woman do it for her. Now she lies down. But the other woman comes in crying. She says the magic woman has fixed it so that the older three children no longer understand they are her children. She is devastated by this and sobbing. I get angry at this injustice. I see a naked brown man, a tribal person, being manipulated by the magic woman as well. I see his penis which is bell shaped, the tip the open area wide and oval like a cow bell. The other woman says she even put a spell on the Aztec totem. I see a wooden cupboard door open and a large Aztec clay figure floats past. Now the magic woman is trying to put a spell on me (the sleeping woman). She/I am upset at her and make the bed raise up and float at her in an attempt to smash her into a plate glass window. I hit her and the window does not break. The magic woman smirks at me. I back up and try it again. I still can't break through the glass but I am managing to roll my bed over her up and down which is flattening her into a paper doll. When I have her flat enough, I light a match and burn her up. She looks very shocked I was able to accomplish this. (375 words)

["Begging Ellie to stop."] Ellie is going from man to man in this building asking each one if he will travel with her so she can go to this place she wants to go. She is sexy and flirty trying to get what she wants. I am very upset and follow her around. I had tried to stop her and convince her she was putting herself in danger. She would not listen. I am very sad. She is turned down by this one young man (I think they are all military men) many times. I beg her to stop. She is making a fool of herself. She is determined and ignores me. She goes to another man and this time he says yes. He obviously sees this as an opportunity for some free sex, just as I had worried they would. I walk up to them. I say, passionately, I will be blunt. My daughter is young. I have warned her about getting pregnant and getting sexual diseases, but she won't listen to me. Please don't get her pregnant. I cry. He looks at me sympathetically and promises he will not harm her. I turn and walk down the ramp to the outside. I walk down a path as I cry. (207 words)

["Howard Again."] Howard and I are traveling on foot. Perhaps someone is chasing us. But we stop at a beautiful waterfall and pond. We swim and it is lovely and fun, except there are alligators in the water. We get out and Howard combs my hair for me and puts it up in ornate braids that have purple cloth covers on them. We companionably walk down the road. We are in the mountains and are looking for a trail or dirt road that will take us back down to the valley to my home. We see a large double trailer truck pass by and decide to follow its route. We find a way down the mountain but we get separated in a town. I don't know what the name of the town is, so I'm not sure where I am in relation to home. A parade is happening. It is on a large long train that passes through the center of town. I can't cross the street to continue my journey until the train finishes and that will be hours. I ask someone the name of the town. I think I am in Connecticut. A car is uncoupled in the train for a few moments and I take advantage of this luck and run across the street. I continue my journey and find home. Now it is the next morning and I get up. I walk out to the living room and am excited about it being Charla's birthday. I want to make a special breakfast for her. She comes up to the house, which has the front wall gone. It just opens out to the lovely countryside. I see Howard outside playing cheerfully with the kids. Ellie is there with Charla. I say to Charla that I am going to make her a breakfast and she is crabby and rude and says she doesn't care and doesn't want it. Ellie defends her right to choose. I am hurt and go into the kitchen, slamming the door and then crying as I set the table and make the breakfast anyway. I come back out after I have calmed down and Howard is there. I look at him. He is in his early 20's, a young, lean good looking man. I rearrange my hair and notice the ornate multiple layering of the braids. I am impressed with his tender skill and thoroughness. He wants me to sit in his lap and cuddle. I wonder why we haven't had sex and then remember I can't bear to have sex with him. I am reconsidering this as he seems so sweet and tender now. I wonder if we could be happy together if we tried again. I sit in his lap. We hug. (458 words)

["A Physics Award."] I travel to a college sitting in a tiny cubicle that is an outhouse, along with a bunch of other tiny outhouses on a trailer. It stinks bad. While at college, I meet some distant relatives, apparently three children of Esther she had after her other family grew up. It is now the end of term and I am trying to remember my M. phone number to give to my new cousin. I remember 475-2266, which doesn't seem right. Then I remember 475-2907. He writes it into a directory. Now we, a crowd of people are getting ready to travel home. I see the outhouses and start to walk over to them. But I change my mind and decide to follow the lead of another of my new cousins. And walk there. Now lots of people are leaving, I guess friends and family members of the students. They walk through the swimming pool. Now an awards ceremony is happening. The woman president of the college calls my cousin's name. He is in the outhouse trailer and doesn't hear. Then they call my name. I have won an award for excellence in Physics and mathematics. I am surprised but walk up toward the front to receive it, because it is my understanding they will do a presentation thing. I see my cousin and tell him. We go up front but by the time we get there, they are wandering around and the ceremony is over. I see that my cousin won his award for excellent playwrighting. He wrote a play called Act III. I tell him I am a writer too. I have had some of my work produced in Dover and in E. I then tell him I probably got good at math and physics because I was married to a physics student and had to learn the language so I could communicate with Howard. We are preparing to walk to M., when someone says Peter, the father of one of my new cousins may be visiting soon. I think that would be interesting. Maybe we'll get along and have a relationship, since he is more my age than these young students. (362 words)

["Fire and incest."] I am in a bedroom. I am supposed to make love to Willie so that I can have his baby because Willie is dead and that will ensure he continues on. I feel quilty because he is a cousin and this will be incest, but it is important to do. I wait for him. Later, I am waiting for a man, but it's not Willie. I don't know who he is, but he is older, and it isn't OK. Maybe my "dad" or an older married man. Later, I am changed into Elizabeth Taylor and I am waiting for my married lover, who is older than me. I look out the window and see him with his male buddies swimming in the river. He is a risk taker and is up to his nose in the deep water. I feel some concern for him and also admiration for his bravery. Now he and his friends are walking up a steep hillside path. At the crest of the hill, he sees a raging brush fire. He turns to escape and they run as fast as they can, but the fire jumps ahead of them and they are surrounded. Fortunately, they find a place where the fire already burned so they are safe. But the fire is eating through the wooden wall of the shelter they are in. Now the flames are men's hands as the Fire "men" come into the house. They see a fire in the fireplace and join their compatriots. They go up the chimney and try to start more fires outside.

["Where's the other kitties?"] I am in a house. I am preparing to pack a few things and go on a day outing. There are four sweet fuzzy kitties. One is white, one is yellow, calico and black. My three daughters are there, as children. I lose track of the kitties because of the preparations. Howard is there also. I pick up the white one. He looks like a fuzzy white slipper, All white fuzz except for the bottom which is a smooth leather with two plastic button eyes. I look around for the other kitties, suddenly concerned. I hadn't seen them for a few days. I ask the girls if they had seen them. They say no, they hadn't. Howard hadn't seen them, either. Now I am worried. I search for them hoping they haven't died from neglect. The phone rings. The university wants to make an appointment with Howard. I say OK, Thursday at 1:00. I hang up. Howard looks up at me and says, but I wanted to stay home with you, because I love you very much. And I wanted to be with the kids. He then realizes the little boy has wandered into another room and he goes to get him. He comes back out and the project he was working on falls apart, because he accidentally kicked it. It was a sort of pumpkin with glue on it in white drops where other melons had been attached. We never do find the other kitties. Now we are in a car going out to the country to find Howard and Jacquelyn Kennedy, in the white house. Howard has something for them. Recent floods caused the river to come out on the road and we are driving through it. Howard is driving sand I am worried it will be too deep and we will get stuck, but we successfully get through. We find a small house were we now live, only four houses down from the White House itself. Later we drive out into a field to have a picnic and I look back to see the white house which is oddly set among a series of old west type buildings. We get to the picnic and I open a huge package of hams. We put three on the grill. I wonder what we are going to do with all the other ones. I hope they don't go bad. (399 words)

["The Disembodied hand."] I am a man who is looking down into a big room full of musicians. Someone gives me a clarinet. I have never played one but I seem to know sort of where to put my fingers. Another man is on my left. As I am trying to play the clarinet, I feel a hand pushing me. It is on my back, up near the shoulder. I sort of see it from another perspective so that I can see that it is a disembodied hand, a big white one. I feel very uncomfortable about this. I blow air into the clarinet and the note is sweet and clear. I fumble more with the fingering. I see my big fingers stretching to reach all the holes. The hand is somehow trying to help me, perhaps, give me an encouraging push. Now the rehearsal is over and I go down into the big room. I find the leader and I tell him I've never played before. He is impressed with how well I do but also somewhat distant. He shows me how to screw the sections together more tightly and shows me a few fingering positions. I practice it. The feeling is I will be very good after I have learned how to do it. (213 words)

["The Mac House is all different."] I arrive at the Mac house to visit my parents who still live there. It is all changed. I walk up the front sidewalk and am amazed at the size of the tree in the front lawn. It has overgrown the lawn to the place that the whole lawn is covered with this rich canopy of leaves. I go in and am surprised to see how much the inside has been remodeled and changed. I go from room to room, exclaiming at how large the rooms are and how many more there are. I tell my father I can't find my way. I can't recognize the original rooms and where they were. I enter my parent's bedroom which has a huge dark wood bed frame. Now I am in the kitchen, where the kid's tables have a special place behind the cabinets. I see the large plate glass windows and beyond I see the ocean. I walk out on the patio on the right side of the house. Dwight sees the ocean and says I wish that that had been there when we lived there. Now Dwight introduces me to a friend of his. A nice man. He walks into the next room and sits at the piano. He plays a blues song. I like it. He also plays a sax. We get along well. I like him and he likes me. (232 words)

["Loving Paul, sad black woman."] Paul Reiser and I are a couple. We're in a small narrow kitchen, trying to fix a breakfast out of the mess on the counter. We are in love and want to do kind things for each other. A teenage boy runs in, loud and rude. Paul tells him to go on home. Get out. Paul is annoyed but still pleasant and tolerant. The boy leaves and Paul and I are feeding each other tidbits of food. The boy comes in again and we repeat the process. Some other person knocks and walks right in. Paul becomes amorous and kisses me. I like it and respond. Now Paul and I are lying together on the floor and Paul and I are sexually excited. I murmur, not here. On the floor. He says, Yes. Here. I say, but people keep coming in. He is kissing me and I give in because it all feels so good. I love him and he feels so sexy and good to touch and be touched. I grasp his hair and gently pull him closer to me. A black older woman in a wheelchair is wheeled in by her son. They see us. I am concerned she'll be shocked and get up and go to her. I look into her face and say It's all right, we're in love and enjoy each other. She looks at me sadly. She says but some people don't get that in their lives. I realize she is lonely and sad. I hug her and we have a long caring hug. Then they leave. Then I hear noises and go to a large open window which opens out to a roof ledge. A large crowd of Paul's friends are trying to sneak up on us. They are laughing and having fun. I see Paul outside, down on the ground and one of his friends is next to me. I tease him saying, Ha, Ha. You didn't surprise us! He laughs. It all feels so loving and fun. (336 words)

["Where will I live?"] I have to move from an apartment and I meet Bill. He shows me a tiny one bedroom cabin I can rent. On the day before I am to move, I go to where Bill is rehearsing a project. His assistaant. is there. I remind Bill of our agreement. He is surprised and upset. He is still using that room to write scripts and so on. I say but we had an agreement. I have no other place to go. He reluctantly agrees to let me move in although he will still be there to finish his work. Later, I show Dovre, who lives with me, a cute photo cut in the shape of a crown and a valentine of Bill at his 50th birthday party. I point out Derek, and his new girlfriend. Derek is in a laughing pose, his head thrown back and a big open smile on his face, like a photo Howard took of Dwight years ago. I point out to Dovre the plain wooden boards the cabin is made of. There are bare nails half hammered in. It is very primitive. (186 words)

["Darcy and the incest."] I am at the V. farm. I am outdoors. I see that Aunt Rosalie, Darcy and her family are camped out down in the pasture. They have been there for a while. We had been waiting for them to come to us. I realize that I will have to go to them. I walk down to the pasture. I talk with Aunt Rosalie. Darcy joins us. I realize that now is a good time to ask them about the incest. I say, in a hesitant tone of voice, I need to ask you a question. It may be distressful for you but I don't know what else to do but ask it. Then I ask Darcy is she had been incested and does she know if I had been incested. Darcy and Aunt Rosalie are pleasant enough. Darcy says Well, actually. There was no incest. I feel oddly uncomfortable about that. Then she says, It's just that my father had some lessons for me to learn. He was teaching me. I then smile, thinking aha. She is in denial. There really was incest. I feel relieved to finally have the answer. (191 words)

["Hiding in a closet."] I am walking down a road with many people. These are my French friends and they are fleeing the enemy. I am a photographer, with a tiny camera. Other people hand me their tiny cameras and ask me to take pictures of them. I look to see where the on button is and so on. I take a number of photos. Then we are rounding a corner when I look back up the road and see the enemy soldiers coming after us. I race over to my friend and yell, they're coming. They begin to panic and run. In the confusion, I run and hide in a closet. My original intent was to hide the camera so the pictures would survive to tell the story but by the time I am in the closet, I hear the massacre outside and I say hidden, to save my life. I knew I could not save them. After the Japanese soldiers leave, I go out and see all the dead bodies. Two boys apparently survived, one is disabled. I take them with me as I sadly walk back to the gas station in France which my French friend had lived and worked. I am gathering up his papers to keep for remembrance sake. I find a scrapbook where my wedding announcement is pasted in it. It is hand written in calligraphy, like my birth announcement I made for one of my girls. It says Barb Anders. Then I see the partially obscured photo of a baby, which looks like Dovre's 6 month old picture. But it is the boy. I burst into intense grieving sobs and cry deeply. I am overwhelmed with my loss of my friend. (284 words)

["Hiding again."] I am teaching a class of 5th graders or so. One uppity girl and two nearly delinquent boys. I like the boys. I work hard to help them. Then I leave. At the door, the boys hug me goodbye and one sticks his head under my shirt and is sucking on my skin just below my breasts. Now, I am walking with a girl, maybe Charla. I look ahead of us and see Yankee soldiers being chased into the woods. They are running through a shallow river. I and Charla are in a building, hiding and I make sure we are not able to be seen and I yell a warning to the soldier who used to be a student of mine. This attracts the attention of the other soldiers as I knew it would. Charla and I run up the stairs where it comes to a platform and a choice. Another flight of stairs going down and a ladder going up to a small ledge by the ceiling. I know it would be more likely I should go down the stairs which will lead to outside and I can run. But I choose to go up the ladder thinking that they will assume I went down the stairs and then I will be safe. I feel doubt about the wiseness of my decision. Nevertheless, we go up the ladder and lie down curled up and wait. The soldiers run up the stairs and others run up the other stairs. I hear them talking about whether they have seen me or not. Some look up and I think they see me, but they all go away. I go on now, alone. I had parked my van over night in some empty lot and I walk there to retrieve it. When I get there, I am upset to see that vandals have stolen things. At first, I think nothing is wrong and then slowly, I notice one thing and then another. Four flat tires, the steering wheel is gone, the front seat upholstery is gone. I see my mother's violin is there. I am relieved at that. The pretty rocks my two school boys found are gone. That saddens me. I see some things lined up under the wheel well on the rear of the van. Evidence. I begin to walk back to downtown to call the police. I feel stupid for leaving my van over night where a rock concert is held. Just asking for it. But I am glad that not any real valuables are missing. I walk and see the big city core of buildings across the huge river. I see the water is high and rapid. I walk along the edge of it, on the sidewalk, a bit worried I will fall in and be swept away. I continue on to the city, looking for Monroe street. Now I am back in the school room to tell the boys and the uppity girl about their rocks being stolen. I want them to know I am proud of them, because I can see they have made important changes She is less up tight and they are more responsible. I feel pleased. (533 words)

["My family destroyed."] I have returned from somewhere, maybe I have been at war. I am trying to connect with my family. I am walking down a long narrow hall with doors. I'd open a door and walk through, closing the door. Over and over and over. I get word from some man that my grandfather is now living with a General. He is having a homosexual affair. He is not interested in connecting with the family. Then I find out my "mother" is having an affair with some man and is gone. Then I find my little "sister," who is 13 years old and naked. I see her budding breasts. I am upset with her and try to talk her into getting clothes on. She laughs at me when I tell her that men come through this hall and some might rape her. She shouts out the word rape and laughs. I race down the hall, going back to find my grandfather. I open door after door and never find him. (169 words)

["Observing life as a couple."] I am struggling hard to walk on a steep embankment. I am concerned that I did not choose the right way to go. The soil is sandy and it keeps sliding under foot, making walking very difficult. I see that if I slip and fall, I will land in a dirty water area. That would be bad. I look up to see if it would be better to walk on the high ridge of the bank. No, that isn't good either. So I continue walking. Suddenly I see that I have made it. I walk into a city area. Right in front of me is a road. On the right it is a deep canyon and on the left, it is flat and a regular street. So I turn left and walk down the street. I look at the shop doors. I am looking for something, but all I see is a mission and a post office. Now, I am transported into a domestic scene. I am seated on a couch watching a couple as they manage their daily routines. Four or five cats, half grown kittens, gray and white spotted ones, hop around me playfully. I go into the kitchen and watch the couple. I am very aware that I live my life as a single person. This is what it is like when you live as a couple. I feel envious about their happiness at being together. (239 words)

["Doing workshops."] I am visiting Ginny. I am in bed. I am sleeping next to Ernie. It is comfortable and friendly. We hold hands. The next morning, I am making changes. Ginny is helping me. I am moving some things around in my house and packing some things. Now I am giving a lecture at a workshop. There are 6 people in the audience. Two on my right, two in front of me and two on my left. I move a rectangular table with uneven sides, like a half of a hexagon, in front of them and begin my lecture. I am reading Italian from a big beautiful book. My accent isn't very good and I work hard to do a good job. (121 words)

["Visiting Hector."] I am in Mexico City to visit Hector and his family. I fly in an airplane and feel quite comfortable. There are fewer stops this time I notice. I arrive and his sisters pick me up from the airport and take me to their house. It is late at night and I am remembering that I did go to the Doctor's office before I left to get the stomach pills to ward off The Terrible Tourista. Sickness. I am taken upstairs to the sister's bedroom where a third small cot has been set up for me. Hector isn't anywhere around and I expected this. I am happy to notice that I feel fine about this unlike the last time when I was angry. I am determined to enjoy this trip and not make the same mistakes I made the first time. (141 words)

["Hector's Mother."] I wake up the next morning and go to the kitchen where Hector's mother is cleaning up. I look out a big window and see a large river running right by the apartment. It is flooding and overflowing its banks. I am talking with his mother about how nice and spacious the kitchen is. This is obviously her pride and joy. I look down and see that the river has risen up so much that it is flooding the kitchen and I am standing thigh deep in the water. I am surprised it isn't cold and then I realize that I'd been standing in it for hours and have grown used to it. Now Hector's mother and I go for a walk up some stairs. The apartment is in the same building as this small city. I see "Jose" who sort of is an older Hector, but is sort of a younger Hector's father. We chat. Hector's brother's are there, doing business in the city. They wear nice business suits. (170 words)

["The Man Helps Pack things."] I need some help packing up some things and bringing them to my big house. A young strong man is helping me. He is very efficient and strong. I watch him as he picks up heavy things and easily loads them into the van. Now I see a tiny black kitten who had his back legs injured and is recovering. I pick him up and hold him, petting him. Now it is time to take the things to my house. We drive to my house which has a large double door entry way. The doors are open and some friends had been doing a garage sale there. I notice a rusty boiler. The man tells me he will not work for me tomorrow as he had earlier agreed to do. I realize he is flirting with me as we are attracted to each other so I simply shrug my shoulders and say OK. I walk into the house. I am now holding two tiny black kittens, one well and the other recovered from the injury and still limps. I release them in the house so they can romp around. They scamper upstairs. Charla is up there playing. The man brings in some boxes and things and puts them down. He and I look at each other and he smiles. I respond with a smile and he walks over to me and hugs me, kissing me in a sexy way. I warm up to his advances. Just then the door bell rings and I go to the door. Jock, Melinda and two more people come in to visit. I wish they would go away because I want to make love to this man. So I ask them in and tell them to hang out in the kitchen, I need to find Charla. I and the man go upstairs to find the kittens and Charla. It is a very large house with spacious rooms and we go from one to the other looking. I see Charla in her bedroom playing with toys. I see the kittens. The man and I kiss again. (350 words)

["Behind the scenes."] I am at a rehearsal but I am only an helper. It is an unusual position for me. The director is upset that the person in charge of maintenance isn't doing his job right and there is no toilet paper in the john. Also there is stuff left in the wrong places. Sparky is around somewhere. I have a notebook, maybe the scene lines, so I can help actors rehearse. I tell myself to try to stay in the background and not foist off my loud attention getting personality onto other people. (92 words)

["Fired."] I am being fired from my job at community college. I am upset about it and want to fight the decision. I talk to some woman who is surprised that I was fired. I explain I was told that the reason I was fired was that I needed a special permit card and my circumstances didn't allow me to have one. She says to me but that's not true. I have a special card. Because I am a friend of community college and a girlfriend too. This means that she has several relationships with community college and she shows me a plastic ID card community college issued to her. I walk to an office to talk to the woman in charge. She is Rosie O'Donald and is taking care of her baby as she works as an executive. She doesn't listen well as she is distracted by her baby. I help her wrap some things but that doesn't help the situation. I need to go to the bathroom. I see a small bathroom and ask permission to use it. She says it has no toilet. So I go down the hall and I hear my Aunt Naomi who is teaching children their letters and sounds. I pass that room by and find the restroom. I go in and see the toilet which is hanging on wires and swinging back and forth. I sit on it but the swinging won't stop. A girl comes in and stands near me. I am concerned I will spray urine out onto her shoes as the toilet is simply a swinging bowl that is hanging above a cement trough. Bicycles are hanging up on the wires as well. People, families, wander in and out. (289 words)

["I play baseball."] I am an 11 year old girl. I am walking into the park. I see a group of boys playing baseball. I see a girl playing with a hockey stick down the sidewalk. I have a hockey stick and challenge her. I keep winning the puck away from her. She is frustrated. I walk on and see a group of girls getting ready to play baseball. The coach, a man, sees me and asks how old I am. I say 11 years old. He walks me to a clear spot and throws a baseball at me. I hit it with the bat and it is a long good hit. I am now on the team.

["I'm packing, eating and planning."] I am at a house, apparently my "parents" house. I am asking my "Dad" about some plans I am making about some group event. Dad is busy setting up his music festival. He has reams of paper on the subject piled up on the file cabinets. I see food on the table and dish up a full plateful of pasta and sauce. I am not hungry but I overeat and feel stuffed. I am packing my things to go back home to work on my plans. (86 words)

["Alone in a spaceship."] I am alone in a space station for 300 days. A man, Howard, really, comes in. We kiss. I am chewing gum and we French kiss. I feel his tongue but the kiss doesn't feel good, or complete. I feel alone and isolated. Now I leave with Howard, I am a bit disappointed it is Howard again, but we leave. We go to a funeral. It is for my "dad." As I am walking down some steps to the room where my "dad" is laid out in state, I hear people exclaiming in wonderment and people crying from surprise and happiness. I realize my "dad" isn't dead after all, or came back to life. I go into the room and try to hug him. When I lean down to kiss his face, I notice that his face is covered by a plastic box like a take out sandwich would have. He looks tired but glad to be alive. (158 words)

["Archie and I dance into love."] I am in a kitchen. Archie is there too. We begin to dance in a Contact Improve way and we are sensually making romantic love while we dance. It is sweet and tender and exciting. I hop up on his waist in the front and he leans way back and we balance while twirling around. It is wonderful. An older woman comes in and she is confused about something that happened in a class or group I was teaching, probably about dreams. She is asking questions and I am trying to explain to her as best I can. Now apparently Archie and I are in love and living together. We are always together, intertwined. A small sink is next to our bed, in my room. Each morning I get up and I see globs of blue toothpaste in the sink from Archie brushing his teeth and not cleaning up after himself. I am annoyed but I also feel fine about cleaning it up for him. It is a loving gesture. A way to help him. I scrub it out, then brush my teeth. We are going back to our work, and Archie says I love the morning ritual you do. I love watching it. I giggle wondering what he meant. He says I am quick and efficient and do the same thing each morning. A man comes by. There is some problem at work that Archie and I and the man need to fix. His wife Mabel Wynia sent him a noodle and cheese casserole to feed us during the work. I feel pleased that she knows I am there and wanted to help me too. (276 words)

["Playing the violin."] I am in a quartet of violin players. We are standing in a row on a lake beach, very near the water. Across the lake is a huge cliff which has seats or bleachers in them for the audience. To my right is the orchestra being directed by a famous director, a man. I work very hard to play as perfectly as I can. I can feel my little finger brushing against the other finger like it has a hangnail or a sore. This could throw off my playing but I concentrate very hard and manage to play very beautiful music that the director is pleased with. I win the contest. (111 words)

["Moving again."] I am looking at a site in Dover, or rather the outskirts of Dover where I may build a house near where Ginny and Ernie live. I see the house in the distance, with lots of windows and skylights. It looks nice. But I am a bit worried about how far away I am from the center of town. It will take longer to run my errands. I am on a bus for awhile and then I am walking and Ernie is riding a horse. We are talking in a friendly way. He reaches down his hand and holds mine. He asks me if that is OK with me. I nod and we continue talking and moving slowly on. It is a friendly and supportive moment. (126 words)

["The Agonizing Place filled with Love."] I am kissing and hugging Howard. It is affectionate and loving. I am also keeping an eye on another man in the background that I am interested in. I think I am trying to get his attention so he will see I am an approachable woman. I think to myself but this is pleasant to be in the place of agonizing and feel so loving and loved. (67 words)

["Sexy hippos."] I am in an old big house. It's a bit run down. Some man keeps coming in with small gifts. I guess he broke something and is trying to repay me with things I had said I wanted. He gives me a china tea set but as I look at it more closely, it is rather coarse thick china with chips in it. Now he's at the front door and I go there and he wants to fix my electricity problem out on the porch. I try to tell him I don't need all this, it isn't necessary. He keeps on doing it. I think he feels guilty. I see a path and call to Charla. I say let's go for a walk and go see the sea lions. She and I walk up the path which goes up a hill. It parallels the coast line so on the left is the ocean. We get to the top and look out over the edge. I see many sea lions out in the ocean. Now lots of other people are coming to see too. They bring radio station equipment and platforms for stages and so on and very soon my view is cut off. I walk around the area trying to see over or past the booths and platforms. I see a weight lifting contest being set up. I find a small place where if I get very close to the edge, I can see. I look and somehow I can see from underwater. I see two hippos. One has the others little curly tail in its mouth and is pulling it backwards toward himself. It is a female hippo who wants to make love to the male hippo. I chuckle. Then suddenly, the male hippo is up the cliff and coming at me. His huge mouth with all those teeth is right next to me and I am trying to crawl and roll away. He has me in his grip and is rolling over me. I am afraid I will be crushed and injured or killed. He seems to want to make love to me. I squirm away from him and walk back down the path, wondering how I can manage all this without my wheelchair. (376 words)

["The disabled man stands up."] I go to the office of Bob T. to get an opinion and some advise. He is in a wheelchair. He is pleasant to talk with and very supportive. Merle is around somewhere. I leave and then need to return and ask him some more questions. I go down a school hall looking for his office. I find what looks like the right place, but none of the green doors have labels on them, so I don't know which door is his office. One door opens and a person walks out on crutches. I figure this is his office and I go in. I turn and see him standing near me. No wheelchair and he is very big and tall. I am surprised. He apparently can stand and walk a bit, like I can. He smiles and sits close to me. Another woman and her friend sit close by and the four of us are in physical contact we are sitting so close together. Our knees bump and so on. I am aware of the contact with Bob. He seems attracted to me and I to him. It is friendly and pleasant. Now I am in a room with my two daughters, Paulina and Ellie. I am cleaning up my things and want them to help carry some of the dresses. Ellie is not interested in being helpful. I am a bit annoyed with her. I look out the window and I see many black whales lying down for a nap. They are above the water line, and are nose to tail thick. Hundreds of them. I then turn and decide to boat down a water way thick with sea lions. I go fast and then turn to go back. I slow down, concerned I will hit a sea lion because they are just under the surface of the water. The water has brown spots of sea weed in it. (320 words)

["Making Masks."] I am sort of working for a movie company. I am trying to get on there, so I volunteer to do things. A very busy harried woman is in charge. She has been given the order to create an unusual bit for this part of the movie. She is stretched beyond her limits and can't seem to think of a way to do that. She is trying to create a mask. I try to help her. At first, it isn't working at all. I am trying to crochet a row out of a waxy candle like material. It keeps crumbling. I then get the idea to curve the mask to the shape of a face, more pointed and narrow at the base, like the chin. I try decreasing stitches and then for the next row to increase stitches. It is still difficult but is working better. The cotton thread is coarse and very black. Somewhere in this dream, Howard is seated on a bench right by me, companionably hanging out with me. It was a friendly feeling. Now the boss wants the woman to create a whole new little scene to put in the movie. She can't come up with an idea. I have one but she isn't listening to me. I'm just an "extra." (215 words)

["Howard says No."] I am in a huge house, where I the children and Howard live. There are many rooms that I never go into. We just don't use them. We are cleaning up and packing, apparently to move or to get ready for the new business to move in and use some of the space. Howard is coming down the stairs and I am going up the stairs, each of us have a pile of clothes and things in our arms. I begin to think about us getting back together again. It seems friendly enough, maybe we could make it happen this time. We smile at each other as we work together to organize and clean this big house. Later, I say to him, I've been thinking, maybe, I mean, I know it would be impossible, but maybe we could reconcile and be together again. He smiles gently and says no. I defensively say well, I know it's no, but I was just thinking about it. I remember thinking to myself just before I said anything that I can't believe I'm saying this. I shouldn't be saying this, because then maybe it would happen. (192 words)

["Bill Cosby's Unusual penis."] I see a naked black man in profile. He is in some argument with a white man. They are standing facing each other, the black man in a more defensive position. I am curious and look down to see if I can see his penis. It is long and thick, and hangs straight down. Then as I watch, it begins to snake around and I see that the tip is like an elephant's trunk, sniffing around. I think the black man is Bill Cosby, in his younger days. (88 words)

["Out of control in the snow."] Ellie is driving the car. I am in the passenger seat. Snow is on the ground. She drives to the back of the house and says look at that hill. I look. It is a very steep driveway going down. I say be careful, back up so we don't go other the edge. I am referring to the cliff in front of us. She tries to back up but we start rolling forward and we are now headed down the steep driveway, sliding and out of control. I am tense but somehow, Ellie manages to keep control enough so that as we are racing 100 miles per hour over the landscape. It is a wild ride but somehow I know we are going to be all right. We finally come to a stop near a restaurant and we go in to have a cup of coffee or something to soothe our nerves. Paulina is with us. She was in the back seat of the car during the ride. We go in and in order to get up to the level where a table is, we have to climb up on a white toilet seat as our first step up. The water is overflowing and I gingerly try to place my foot so it doesn't get wet. Then I have a very high step to make up a sort of water slide thing. (232 words)

He stands up on the back of the chair just above my shoulders and then sits, draping his ;egs down over my shoulders. I tickle the bottom of his bare feet. He laughs and we giggle, having fun. Later, I am walking down a hall. I see Howard in another room and he comes out toward me. I am a bit surprised because he is dead. His face is white and quite round. I smile and say I've been meaning to ask you a question. He waits. I say, Was it the National Merit scholarship or the Rhodes scholarship you got? Or both? He says both. I say well, they realized just how smart you were. But then maybe they took the Rhodes one back, because no one can have both. He is very pleased that I acknowledged how smart he was. I say good bye, realizing I was luckily to catch him and ask this question, since he is dead, but just not all the way gone yet. (182 words)

["Paulina Comes To Me."] I am going to do a performance and then I will catch a plane to visit Paulina. Another woman and I are to read some of our writings to a small group of people in a room. I am frantically looking for my book I read from. I can't find it. Now it is my turn and the people, who are standing up in various parts of the room are waiting. I talk to them as I rifle through a book looking for my place. I am charming but I can't find anything. I apologize and give up. I go back stage to call someone to get things ready for the trip. I can't use the phone because the next act is a rock band that uses a computer modem hook up with their act. Time is ticking away and I can't seem to find the man who can get me to a phone. I go looking for him and find myself in a tiny boat just off shore of the island we are on. The water is very rough and choppy. I am worried. I can't imagine trying to return to the mainland over this difficult bit of water. I then look again and see the tide has gone out and the water is gone. I ask someone to pick up my boat, with me in it, and put me on shore so when the tides return, I'll be safe. Someone does that. Now I walk back into the building. Finally I realize it is too late. My plane left at 12:30. The rock band is done and I try dialing. I can't remember who I was to call. Maybe Dr. M. for permission to go, no. Maybe my mother. No. Maybe Paulina. Then I turn and see that Paulina is there. She had used my unused ticket and flew to visit me. I am happy. (317 words)

["Fast and wily baby."] I have three children. A girl, about 8 years old, a boy about 2 years old and a young baby. We live in a city that is all indoors. We have two places we live. We are traveling from one place to the other. The girl is argumentative and not helpful. The boy is active and having fun. The baby is always sneaking away from me and popping up in odd corners. The baby keeps changing shapes as well. At first it was a normal baby. Then it was a small rag doll. Then a toy. I am angry at the girl for not helping me watch the baby. I am frustrated with not being able to keep up with the baby. At one point, the baby in the shape of a small doll was caught in a corner behind the wall like it was in a mouse hole. I had to wriggle it free. Then it bounced off to get into other mischief. Now we decide to travel back, on foot to our other place. We meet a male neighbor and the girl is talking with him. I am concerned that she is so unconcerned about talking with strangers. I come out to supervise. We return to the first place and I do a visual check to see if anything is amiss. I see three places where I left things on. The toaster nearly burnt something near it. I comment that I could have burned the house down. (249 words)

She laughs at me contemptuously. I angrily walk back to the tasks I was doing, maybe in the kitchen. I am still crying, feeling great pain and overwhelmed by all I have to do. I go back to check Charla. She is taking a bath and I am furious. This is goofing off. I told her not to do anything. Her hair is full of shampoo and I grab her roughly by the nape of the neck and I slap her and shake her. I am aware I am out of control and doing and saying hurtful things that are wrong but I can't seem to stop. I feel guilt and am driven to continue. Charla is arrogant and doesn't stop pushing at me. I am washing her hair and as I look more closely, I see many different colors of hair. It is dyed pink, purple, blue, and other bright colors. I ask her why she did that. She shrugs her shoulders and says because she wanted to. (200 words)

["Flying, Aliens and a manual wheelchair."] I I am in a mechanics shop because my van is broken. I am waiting a long time and the owners seem to be watching me very closely, but from a distance. It makes me nervous. I pace up and down, pretending to exercise, but really trying to keep an eye on these strange people. Finally, after many hours, I am now waiting in their living room. The boys are in there too and they watch me suspiciously. I notice I am now in a manual wheelchair and I pop a wheelie, balancing on the back wheels. This impresses the boys very much. I seem to have gained some power by impressing them. I keep doing it. Now the living room furniture has been removed and the boys are setting up a game for a contest. Three large tin cans are piled one on two to form a pyramid. A long line of these clusters of cans go down the center of the room. I am now in another room where a TV screen is in the wall and is playing Star Wars. A food table is set up. These strange boys are watching me. I begin to wonder if they are aliens. I get worried and nervous. I find a moment when they are not looking and sneak out and down the stairs to the shop. I look for my van and finally find it. It is all changed and I get in. The aliens are on to me and I must hurry. I am excited and a bit scared. I try the key and am able to get it going. The faster I go, the more the van rises up in the air. I am flying. The aliens are in pursuit. I have to work hard to keep the van above the tree line. I look ahead and see a mountain range. I keep forcing the van higher and make it over the mountains successfully. I call in to a small town airport and tell them I know this is strange, but I am flying a van and don't know how to land it. They give me instructions and I made it in safely. (366 words)

There is a group of men who are after me, to steal me into their tribe. There is one man, not of their tribe, or my tribe, who is very attracted to me. But when he approaches me, I shy off and run, thinking he is like the others and means to entrap me. He is incredibly patient. He repeatedly waits in the clearing and very slowly approaches me. Gradually, I allow him to approach, as I am also fascinated and attracted to him as well. But the bad guys keep breaking through and use the advantage of his attracting me to try and capture me.

["Hurting Myself."] I am in a log cabin and outside is a big burly bear throwing himself against the cabin wall, trying to break in and get us. A man, maybe my brother Jake is standing near the door, a screen door, trying to shut it against the bear. Now I am crying, because I must spread melted butter on my left hand. I think that ritual is because I must spread the butter on someone and I am unwilling to hurt someone else so I am forced to do it to myself. I resist but I must do it. I am crying at the awful brutality of having to harm myself, to save others. Now the bear is coming and I must hide. The only place to hide is inside an old wood burning stove. I crawl in backwards and am soon coated with the cold dead ashes of a previous fire. I feel sad and cornered. (156 words)

Then I get braver and am organizing a talent show. I am performing and becoming more prominent in the crowd. Now I am in danger because they can easily find me. I run out the door and they chase me. I flap my arms and start flying. I have to think myself higher. Then I think to fly without flapping, or I'd get too tired. The sky is clear and blue which is bad because I'm an easy target now. They are shooting arrows at me. I take off my sleeveless white blouse and use it as a sail, attaching it to a stick (I just happen to have with me) It also conceals me so I am a bit safer. I think up a cloud and go into it to hide. (167 words)

["Swimming and my nodules are easing up."] I am in a swimming pool. It is crowded. A man, sort of Nate and sort of built like Michael, the German that Dovre likes. He is very friendly and we chat. I get out of the pool and we are standing. He comes up to me and we start to hug and kiss, it is getting sexual. Now the scene shifts and I am in an apartment, supposedly mine. I wake up and look around to discover that the landlords have been remodeling. I walk around and see to my surprise my bedroom is empty and gone, another tiny room has been added and an odd high platform I assumed would be the frame for a bed mattress, but it would be too high for me to use. I am annoyed and upset that they would come do this without even asking or telling me. I go outside. I walk down the street. No now I am in another house. I am sort of the house mother person. A man named Warren comes up to me and chats. I realize he and I had danced at some costumed ball and didn't at first recognize him. Now I see a TV film crew is setting up. They are doing a documentary on me and my family and how we do dreams together. I remember about my dream software and want to tell the director about it so we can talk about it when being filmed. I walk over to a small group of men who are busy talking about setups and shots and so on. I try to get their attention. They ignore me. I get more insistent. Finally I hear the director say to the others that they are not really interested in hearing from me. I see an outline of the topics and line after line says Law. They will do a quick sound bite about me and the kids sharing He then turns his brightly red scarfed head away from me. I say to him, "Fuck You." I turn and leave the room. I am very angry at them for ignoring me. A woman comes up to me, very close into my face and says that she wanted to interview me a bit for the 3:00 segment. I tell her about how the men treated me and how angry I am. She listens patiently and then says she will massage my left leg. I say oh no, please don't touch it. I have very painful nodules there Too painful to touch. She takes down my ugly green sock and pulls up my ugly pants leg. She begins to massage the area very gently. I am surprised it doesn't hurt but a little. She says. They are softening and going away. I am glad for that. (468 words)

["Floods and counting my pills."] I am in a house. I look out the back window and I see the water, a vast body of it, lapping right up to the window sill. I remark to some woman that it is calming and pleasant to have the water up so close. I then wonder what would happen if it rose any higher. It is raining. I go to the kitchen to find my pills. I have found some but they are huge round chewable ones and I'm not sure which ones I should take. I am now trying to replace a bottle cap and can't find the right bottle. Someone says The water is rising. I hold a milk carton, a quart sized one, in one hand and I go to the room where the window is. I see the water pouring into the house from under the window sill. Someone says we have to go higher and we all grab for whatever belongings are near us and go up the stairs to the attic. I walk the length of the house going from room to room. I think to myself, Ah, one room for women and another room for men. I open an old closet cupboard and see old world war I uniforms there. Musty and dusty. I go to the other end of the house and see some dishes and a tiny sink. I look for a small refrigerator but don't see one. I guess the milk will go sour. I go to the back room. The windows are covered with brownish tan colored shades that are nailed shut. I then look out after finding a place to peek. A long ditch is being dug by the towns people. The water seems to have receded somewhat. I am encouraged. But then the waves swell and the people in the ditches are covered over and struggle to get above water. They do. I look around the small room and see a pipe with a stream of water coming out of it. This is not good. I call for the man who comes to, look at it. Now I realize the floods have taken the house off its foundation and we are floating out to sea. I look out the window and see that we are scraping over dry land to get there, but we are floating anyway. People on the sides are shouting encouragement. One man yells look at me and is shooting a shotgun at a bird to show us how to hunt for the right bird for food. I wonder how long we will be gone. (434 words)

["Valentine cards at the wrong season."] I live in a kind of boarding house. My mother is the "house" mother. I walk downstairs. I am now sitting on a couch and trying to weave or knit something out of a soft creamy white yarn. A man sits near me on my right. He's kind of a nerd, like Charles S. of high school and a bit like the Charles I met last year at the conference in California. He seems friendly and I am not particularly interested in him. He comments on my yarn project. I show him the stitches and as he looks at them, he leans very close, and we keep brushing against one another innocently. I stand up and walk into the kitchen to find something. He follows. I see a candle is leaning too much to one side and try to position it more upright. He says Why don't you take a picture of it? As though it looked interesting. I sigh and say no, but then I change my mind and say what the heck. I go into the living room and pick up something thinking it was the camera. I am surprised to see it is a package of Valentine cards and I wonder out loud why I am addressing them at this time of year. I put them back and sit on the couch again. A woman is seated in a chair on the right. I ask do I know her? She says she thinks we were introduced. I say I don't remember you. Are you sure you didn't move in after I went away for a month? I then say I am the house mother's daughter. Oh, she says. So that's you, eh? Charles is near by again and suggests we look for the camera. I get up and go to a dresser and look around on the top. He points to a huge green plant hanging on the tall brick walls. He says I am surprised this cost $6 dollars. I say Really. Isn't it fake? He agrees it is fake. (344 words)

["Rescued and scared."] I am on a small box adrift in the oceans, having been abandoned. A man is out there also, on another raft or box. I have drifted away from him. I have been out there for days. I am in deep exhaustion and fear. A shark or something big and dark is following. All it has to do is bump the box and spill me over and eat me. I see a dark fin rise in the water. It is near. Then it becomes a dark submarine. I slither from my box onto it and pound on the door yelling at them to help me please. Finally a crewman hears me and opens the hatch. I am now down in the submarine and in bad shock. We are walking down the narrow hallway of the submarine and there is water flowing in it up to my knees. I am terrified of the dark fish ;like shapes I see in the water. The captain is now there, sort of Kelsey, the actor from Fraiser on TV. He soothes me and I slump up against him hugging him for security. He is tender and understanding. We end up in a set of small rooms. His rooms, but they are sort of cute and domestic, curtains and a tiny kitchenette table. I am warning him that something is waiting for him down there, maybe the enemy submarine. We are becoming friends, respecting each other. Romance is a possibility. (245 words)

["Showering with the girls."] I see my dream mother who is very tired. She has been working very hard. I say come on into my room and lie down and rest. She does. I walk with her and after she is lying down, I decide to change my clothes. I go to the closet and see lots of hangers laying down in a row blocking my way to the clothes. I manage to reach through and get a dress, my purple sleeveless jumper. I am looking for a blouse too. I realize most of these clothes I'd gotten at Good will and didn't recognize them Most are too small for me to fit into. I am interrupted and I decide to walk across the long hall and change in the other bedroom, the one belonging to other siblings. I decide I need a shower and take my clothes off. I notice that along one wall of this outer bedroom are shower heads or sprinklers and water is pouring down the wall. It does not occur to me that that is the shower. Instead, I open a metal door and step in to a very long and narrow metal shower stall, where three or four other women, in colorful bikini's are already in there. I am surprised and a bit embarrassed by my nakedness. One woman says to me this is a class. Oh, I say. The shower water turns on and I get my hair wet. Just as I hear a click that I suspect will be the shut off of the water, I suddenly decide to shampoo my hair and sure enough with my hair all lathered up, the water stops. The other women are not sympathetic. (284 words)

I look up at the straight up sheer cliff on the side of the road. It has grasses and other vegetation. I begin to pull myself up hand over hand on this vegetation. I get part way up, out of the way of the train. Unfortunately, a large lion, like mountain lion that is colored like Boomer comes out of the cliff, maybe a hidden den, and lies down to nap. More and more of them come out. I hold very still, hoping they don't notice me. Someone else is there and I call out to warn them. That then makes the lions notice me. (134 words)

["Running with the wolves."] I am at some gathering of women, maybe a university campus. The women seem distant and unsociable. They all begin to walk out toward the woods. I follow and soon realize that they are really wolves in human form. I become frightened. I run and they chase me. I desperately climb a tree. The wolves jump and growl threateningly at the base of the tree. I am high enough up that they can't get me. However, I see a black panther in the tree and in order to save myself I pretend to roar very ferociously at it. I am afraid but somehow it worked and the panther leaps over me and runs away to another tree. Now later, I am coming back to the campus. The women are gathered to do some performance. One woman draws a circle and chants and drums. I am suddenly hypnotized by this and lean into the circle, laying my hands and arms into it. I transform into a wolf, huge glowing eyes, big teeth and growling vicious personality. I growl and threaten. Then I run. I am being hunted down. I crawl into the bushes and slink up hill under cover, I am still in human form, but I am a wolf. Or at least I am experiencing things as a wolf. I come around a corner and peer down an embankment. I see a half grown boy playing with his baby chickens, ducks and bunnies. My eyes glitter in hungry anticipation. I slouch down the embankment and swoop down on the unsuspecting innocents. I eat the ducklings and am approaching the bunny. The human part of me is aghast that I would eat live creatures and hates the sounds of it dying. The wolf part doesn't care. It just takes and eats.

["Teaching and Counseling stopping a father's incest."] I am substitute teaching for a history and an economics class. I am walking around the tables answering questions and checking on student's work. As class is almost over, I am talking with one young woman. I realize she has been sexually abused by her father and it continues even today. Several of her siblings are in the class as well. I go to the father (who looks like that short plump man who does the Lions Duck Run fund raiser to stop abuse) and tell him this is sexual abuse and it is wrong. He denies it all. I go back to the woman, feeling I had let her down because I had said I would counsel them and help them. I feel sick about it. But the father comes back to me and says It's ok because an angel comes to him and says it is the right thing to do. I say, Ah, but that is your way of making it seem ok so you can do it. I said, You are basically a good man. You have a moral conscious and you know the difference between right and wrong. He is gratified to see I understand that. He changes his mind and agrees that I can counsel the family. (213 words)

The bear is lying down at the head of the bed, across the pillows. I am standing near the door in case he turns on us. Ginny is timidly and carefully approaching him. I say wait. We need to plan our escape should he turn on us. Ginny agrees. We decide to take a left after we exit the room, slam the door shut and race down the hall to the next set of doors and try to lock them and then, does anyone know where the elevator is? No. OK, we know where the stairs are, so we will head down the hall to the stairs. Hopefully that will give us time to escape. (147 words)

["Snow boating."] I am on top of a mountain with other people and we need to return home. I guess we are in enemy territory and we are being chased. We find a boat and decide to try and slide down the snow covered mountain in the boat. I count the people. There are twenty. I see how tightly we are packed in. We slide down to a cliff and stop. I peer over the edge and see a river with black people swimming in it. I see we are soon to leave the snow and enter the jungle. The men chasing us are near by. We get out and try to sneak through the area to get to the jungle. I lean up against a wall listening to the British and German soldiers talking, waiting for our chance to slip by them. (141 words)

["Frustration at not figuring out the categories."] I am explaining to my father, another older man and someone else what I need to complete my dream software. They each go off and try to create what I need. Cousins come by in a car and visit. Six men in a line, perhaps the cousins, as a trick or joke, all together rush at a freshly painted wall and smash their foreheads at it. This leaves an imprint for each man. They laugh. At first I am upset, but then I remember that my father had wanted such a momento. Now my father returns with lots of papers with still photographs on them. He shows them to me, excitedly explaining how this will answer my category problem. I am at a loss to see how. I need a movie or continuous stills. I see a huge machine in the right hand corner of a picture. I say to my father, but what I need to see is the machine moving. Apparently part of the story in the pictures is that a young girl gets crushed in half and dies with that machine and I need to see it to understand how to write the story well. Meanwhile, my father shows me lists of categories like Orderlies and corpsmen. I say but I don't have those categories. I try to read what he has to understand it. I can't Now I go to the window to witness the crushing of this girl. I see the front part of the machine open and she is lying on her tummy. A metal stick like thing comes down on her spine with great force and she splatters and dies. I break into a torrent of tears. The old man takes me into his lap and tries to soothe me saying don't cry. I say but I must. This is good because it means I feel the pain deep enough that I can write it well. (323 words)

I need to go out, and I go out and we're sort of in Alaska. In lots of snow. I am with some guy and he gives me a pair of earrings. They are sort of temporary. I say, I haven't worn any for awhile.

I then see the male leader is in a crib, naked, and he looks like Howard. He is lying on one side and is in shadow. I'm starting to take the earrings out. The same man is now there, dressed and not in a crib. He says you can keep the earrings on. I hesitate and then keep them in. I see he is trying to be nice to me, and so I say well, it was kind of nice to have them in again. It was a good screw. (199 words)

["Massacre and I shot the sherriff."] I am in a house. Now I walk outside to a long wooden ramp. People are out there. I have a small, very small hand gun in my right hand. I fire at people and kill them, even though 2 cops are standing very close by. A man at the end of the ramp begins to come after me. He has a big machine gun and is killing people wholesale, coming after me. I run into the house and climb the stairs until I am in the attic and find a hide hole to crawl into. The man sets the house on fire to burn me out. I am fortunate the corner I'm in doesn't burn. I crawl down the charred stairs and begin to look through a box and am checking off any items that have sugar in them. Ernie and his two boys, Ricardo and Rigo are there. Rigo asks if he can help me check off the list and I show him how to do it. (169 words)

["Getting taken care of!."] I am staying at a hotel, perhaps some convention. Jim E. writes me a note, asking me to have lunch with him, or to go to a dance. I want to change my clothes. I am very contented with the special luxury service at this hotel. I paid a $15 charge and they will do anything for me at any time. I love it I laze by the pool and then call them up and they meet me at my room to help me choose what to wear for my date. The woman who is helping me is Terry, my past personal assistant who says this service is nearly at an end and If I want her to continue I will pay her $7 an hour. I don't want to have to pay so much but I'd gotten quite used to enjoying this extra service. I look forward to the several hours in the morning when I am giving her instructions and she is doing the work. I'll probably spring for the money because I like the pampered feeling I have when she does it for me. (187 words)

["Knitting A Pair of Pants."] Tim Allen and his wife and I are room mates. He comes to me and we talk. He wants me to counsel him because he lost his job and his wife is unhappy with him. He genuinely wants to change but is confused about how to do it. I tell him kindly that I can't do that. I explain that it would be unethical of me because I am a room mate and want to be there for both Tim and his wife. He understands. I offer to give him some names of people he can contact. He agrees. Now we are in another room, a bedroom, I think. Tim is in one bed and I am in the other. I am preparing for sleep. He is knitting, sitting up in bed. I ask him what he's making. He says its pants. I laugh and say let me see. He comes over to show me. I see a regular pair of jeans down to the knees and then he is knitting the rest of the pants legs. I say oh, you're not knitting pants, you are knitting pants legs. (189 words)

This was a meaningful creative piece and I am destroying it without thought. I do it to a second one as well. I am gathering up small objects out of drawers and so on. I look through a shelf of books. I am hearing some report on how A movie company in Russia wants to film in real outer space but the story isn't even about outer space, it's about love.

["Crawling up the hard way."] I am walking down a street. A man is watching me. I think he is attracted to me. The street is full of debris and potholes. I am walking toward a big freeway that intersects the street. Thousands of vehicles rushing past. I am worried about how to cross safely. A dump truck backs up toward us and is beginning to lift up the dump part to loose all the debris into the street, right where I would cross. Another man darts ahead and I now try to cross rapidly before I am buried alive under garbage and junk. But no matter now hard I try to go fast, I can barely move. I am lying on the street clawing my way trying to crawl, but still barely moving. I am afraid the dump truck will dumps its stuff on me. But I somehow persevere and make it across now I'm standing and trying to run. It's like we in an underpass. I decide at the last moment to climb up to the next level on a cement pole with metal foot rests in it like a ladder. I scramble to the top and crawl over a chain link fence only to be encountered by a stone faced cop. I made it this far and I can see life is so much better here so I aggressively stare him down and tell him to leave me alone. He does. I go on, moving normally. (244 words)

["Drunk rock and roll star sells self."] I am a man and a member of a famous rock and roll band. After the show, I lie down on the floor with a bottle of booze, very drunk. The young women are coming up to the bar to buy our services. One pays for me and I get up and we walk into a large room with benches and curtains setting off tiny cubicles on the bench, only enough room for a man to sit and a woman to sit on him. People are having sex all bunched up together like that. I look for an empty seat and find one. As I sit down, the other two cubicles beside me open up so that we lie down. I guide my penis into her and feel the extreme sexual thrill of going inside. I feel a faint orgasm. It is over very quickly. I am glad I was able to find the place to get it in. Pretty soon, another woman will buy me and I will do this over and over. I am very drunk and spacy. Someone, a man, I think looks at me like he'd like to make love to me. (I feel like I'm a woman inside, so I think he is attracted to me as a woman). But I get bored and tired and decide to walk home. I walk past him. He is lying on the grass. I pat his head sympathetically and say, "I am going to see my father." He nods. I walk down to the ocean front and wade in the surf, looking for the creek I can swim back up to my home. A woman tells me I have to be careful of the cross currents of the ocean and the creek meeting. I see a water slide on the other side and a flight of stairs going up. I am trying to decide which way I will return home and decide not to cross the creek, but to wade right up it. It's harder that way, but I want to go that way. (346 words)

Now a male director is trying to organize us. I am looking through my scripts and can't find the last section, number 21 or 22. Others can't find theirs either. He is annoyed with us and lectures me on being responsible. I feebly try to indirectly blame it on the woman on the train who might not have given it to me in the first place. But I do remember having it. I look harder, feeling guilty and embarrassed. I do find it in my pile of papers. We are going to rehearse. (231 words)

I am getting my guitar out and notice one string is out of tune. I try to tune it, but the string comes undone and I can't get it back in correctly. My sister tries to help. We are on stage and the audience is restless and booing. Then two people in the audience start their own music, singing and guitar, they are very good! This is their way of humiliating us. I am wearing a sort of tail coat with a high pointed collar. I pull out the fiddle and begin to play with them, harmonizing and counter point. They are impressed I am so good. I walk down the aisle in the audience to join them. Now a number of people are walking up and down the aisle playing instruments, and I see with concern they all had very wide fat butts. This is the only acceptable body shape here. Of course, I look normal, which makes me abnormal. I get a clever idea and my sister and I walk, arms entwined, both of us playing. I am on the right and now she's on the left. I bow and she holds the fiddle and does the fingering. We walk down the aisle carefully, stepping together as one person. This makes our butt wide enough to be acceptable. We are playing a song. "We are having a baby, a baby, a baby. We are having a baby. Tra la, tra la, tra la. ." We step into an open suitcase and out of it without tripping or missing any notes. Everyone is impressed. We are successful. Tweedle dee, and tweddle dum. (307 words)

I decide to clean this stuiff up and I find a broom and a garbage can and I am scooping up masses of steamy smelly maggots and carrying these things over to the garbage can and so on and I'm trying to get things cleaned up and finally I get some other people interested and we decide we are going to throw away the old bed and the old clothes and get things cleaned up and dusted up and make it more useful.

We are going to have lunch. I ask him to have lunch with me. My mother begins to set the food before us, mostly by throwing it from where she is seated on a couch which is not facing us. I say to the man, I feel uncomfortable so far away from you. I'll change my place. I move myself over to right across from him. I quickly drink my soup not really looking at him or talking. I get up to put the dishes away in the adjoining kitchen. I talk a bit with him as I carry the glass dishes into the sink. I put the pretty glass cake plate with the circle place for a cup of tea on it into the sink. I move two empty soda cans aside. As I return to get more dishes I see my mother standing at a sink full of water in the dining room, near the foot of the table. She is going to dye her hair with hydrogen proxide. She asks me how much to put on. I tell her I'm worried she'll bleach patches of her hair if she pours it out of the bottle straight on the hair. I suggest she pour it into the water in the sink and wash her hair in it. She doesn't like that idea. (255 words)

I see some crackers shaped like teddy bears (crisp bread, really) and some blonde colored sliced meat. A note from Aunt Bridget says help yourself. I look at the meat, but it looks unappetizing and I don't know how long it's been out, unrefrigerated. So I nibble on a cracker and like the taste. (103 words)

["The enemy or the helper?"] Ellie and I and our babies are kidnapped and tied up and put in a car. I fight the man, hating him. We go to an old house and I manage to get enough free to knock him down. I hit him over and over with a hammer, first on the penis and then on the head. I try to kill him. I force him to lie on the floor, holding him at gun point while I also get a pair of scissors, since I can't find a knife, and cut Ellie's ropes. He keeps trying to get up and I threaten him again with the gun, which I had wrestled from him. It is broken. Ellie and I take the babies to the car and start driving away from him. He chases. We pass through a small western cow town where the people look like traditional cowboys. I think about finding a sheriff and getting help but decide this is probably his people so I don't stop. I continue driving down the straight road. Finally I stop to call for help. I learn that the man is actually trying to help us. He rescued us from our parents who were going to kill us. In fact, as soon as we were gone, they had three more babies to replace us and could care less about our well being. I am now confused and don't know if this is a good or bad guy. (244 words)

["Love My Daddy"] My "Mother" and I live on and run a ranch. We have a good strong relationship. She is very protective of me. My "Daddy" comes home. He and my "Mother" love each other very much. She tells him about this man in the neighborhood that she's worried about. He's out to get me and she doesn't want me to get hurt. I say Oh don't worry. My "mom" taught me what to do with a man's arms if he should jump me. My good looking "Father" and I are also equally attracted to each other, sexually aand lovingly. He teases me about knowing what to do with a man's arms. My "Mom" keeps going outside the barn and watching off into the distance, listening intently. I say to "Dad" I wish she wouldn't do that. It makes me nervous. He grins at me and I suddenly shove him up against the wall and we laughingly wrestle. I pin his arms back and bite him hard. He has to let go. He laughs and says She taught you right. I have both his elbows in my one hand and have my other hand free to fight" him. We laugh. I am pressed up to him. He says you got me in a belly press. It feels good and sexy to both of us. Now "Mom" is outside again and up an embankment to the fence. She comes back into the barn and says. I don't like it out there. Something's wrong. So I now hold a rifle or shotgun. The three of us begin to sneak across the barn to the house to see what's up. Even the horse gets down low to the ground and sneaks across. As we get to the outer porch area, I see an ugly bad guy holding my grandparents hostage. He has a gun on them. Granddad is bloodied. We peak in the kitchen door and see two more bad guys. They see us and one comes out to threaten us. I hold the barrel of the gun right at his lower abdomen. He grins at me because I have courage, but he doesn't believe I have the strength to do it. I aggressively poke at him to make him go back in. A man hands me his business card. Something about Commuters. Real Estate Express. They are stealing our land. They are strong and many. We are overpowered by them. But we fight strong and good. (412 words)

I am in a bathtub filled with water. I scoop up water into a plastic sack and hold him with the sack between us so he gets this warm massage kind of feeling. He laughs and likes it.

["Dancing like mad."] I am dressed in my sexy hot pink dress at a dance. No one else is dancing but a woman, Marilyn, from work, comes over and asks me to dance with her. She pulls me up out of the chair by the arm. I start dancing. We do exaggerated moves, going into the adjoining room, where many men are standing around talking. They laugh with us as we gaily dance around and through them. In the first room, I see they are gearing up to dance some ballroom type dancing, like the waltz and the tango. I want to join them and learn those dances, but Marilyn wants to continue our odd dance. We do. Someone comments that our style is silly. Marilyn (now Lucy) has too much arm movement and I do too much leg movement. (137 words)

["Bullseye."] I work in an office which is very crowded with desks and secretaries and other workers. My secretary is leaving on Monday and I realize, with guilt, I should be getting her a gift and throw a party. On Monday, after she is gone, there is more room. I like that. I am rearranging the desk supplies. Patsy is there and gives my secretary a wall hanging which is exactly like the one she gave us. I notice ours is broken. There is moss and little plants on the knickknack. Now a man challenges me to shoot a hole with a rifle in a small circle painted on a booth, one of a series of them up a wall of a building. I try to aim the rifle, but it keeps swinging back and forth so that I haven't got a lock on the target. I feel tense. Then I relax and intuitively wait until the swing is just before reaching the target. I fire. I hit the mark easily, each time. This impresses the man. Now I am traveling in a small moving cart to get my prize. Like an elevator, we go up the outside of the building, but my booth is over on an overhang and the cart creeps along the edge and I feel excited and scared. Another man is in the booth and he is surprised to learn I had such good skills. He asks me questions. He asks What gun do you own? I say I don't. I just have my ex-husband's rifle. How much do you practice? He asks. I say I don't. He is impressed. I ask if it's OK to stamp my own tickets. He says no, then I could get away with not paying for the tickets (like postage stamps). I get back in the cart to return. (308 words)

["Babies and Fleischman wants me back."] I am ill and lying on a hospital bed. I have a small baby with me. Dr. Fleischman, of Northern Exposure, used to be my lover and he wants to get us together again. He lies down on the bed with me and the baby. He is pretending to pay attention to the baby, but he is really trying to get close to me. I have one breast exposed because I'd been feeding the baby. Fleischman lays his head down by my breast. He desires me sexually. I am vaguely aware of this and passively lie there waiting. I realize I must reach out in some way to respond to him if I want him. I contemplate doing that, still filled with a soft resistance. (125 words)

["Teaching the man to take care of his baby."] I am on a high mountain top. People are there, each group sitting or lying on a cot. One man and his baby lie in a cot. I go over to help him take better care of the baby, who is crying. I put some drops of milk on his nipple and place the baby there for feeding. The baby hungrily nurses. Then I pick up the baby. I see his cute face and dark black hair. He is wearing a plastic sack up to his armpits. At the bottom of the sack is milk he had drunk. I hug him and pat him. He is happy. Now it is necessary for all of us to leave the mountain top and go down the mountain. It is snow and ice and we struggle. We get to a sheltered spot around a big rock when I realize the people we had counted on to be there weren't going to show up. Bad people were coming close and we had to make the rest of the difficult journey alone without help. It is difficult, but we make it. Now we are at an outdoor fair where people sell their merchandise in booths and in old motel rooms. I walk from one to the other looking at the wares, but not interested in any of them. Some strange man, a bad politician is around. (231 words)

["Just had a baby, looking for my granmere."] I have two rooms and I have lots of stuff in both rooms. And I am packing things up and I go from one room to the other to pack up lots of clothes and papers and things. And then I'm go apparently to M City but on the way I stop at a candy factory store. I'm in my wheelchair and I go into the building and I look at the displays of candy and so on. I had gone the accessible way but I decide to go back through the front, where everybody else goes. This required going on an escalator. This is exciting. The escalator went up and all of a sudden at the top, there was this drop off and no hand rails so I looked down and I could see there was the tip of another escalator there so, I went on to that and hanging on to the round and metal handrails on the left side and I did that 2 or 3 times. Each time, I'm not quite sure the escalator will be there underneath me. Each time it was. The last escalator was a series of black padded steps that rotate and drop you from one step to another. Pretty exciting. At the bottom I see some people were watching. One had a video camera and I thought that was cool. I'm trying to find my way out to the front door and some woman dropped her bag of candies and they're all over the floor and a clerk was trying to help clean it up. It was a liquidy mess. She asks what kind of candy is this. The woman told her, because they are going to replace the candies. Now I'm not in a wheelchair because I am barefoot and am going to tip toe through the mess. Without getting any of the mess on me. Now I'm going down a long aisle like in a store. I'm in my wheelchair again. Behind me I see Mabel and Dominic. Dominic looks terrible, like he's balding and like he's had cancer. He looks old and pale. I yell behind me. Mabel, Dominic, Hi. I've had a baby. Come see. They say hi, but they don't really stop. A woman says hello did you have any luck finding GranMere Madeleine? And I realized that a year ago I was in this store looking for information about my great grandmother. And I'm embarrassed to tell her I had done nothing with the information for the past year. I wondered if I would see someone I had met doing that search. I say, well, take a look at my baby. She pokes my belly and I say that hurts. I just had a baby 2 days ago. Look at my baby and reach into my handbag. The baby is so tiny that it's cradleboard is the memo notepad like the one Dwight and Corinne gave me for my birthday. So the baby's like and inch to 2 inches in total length. I pick it up and turn it over with some concern. Hopefully the baby is still breathing. I wasn't paying much attention to it. I had kind of stuffed it into the handbag without much attention to it. But it is OK, and the baby is sleeping. I hold it in my hand to show it off and they all ooh and Ah. Then I head on out the door. I see the van. To the left appears my mother and father in a lovely red convertible sports car and they are going to drive with me and my old van and them in their lovely sports car in tandem to M City. (620 words)

I feel ok about what we did and what I learned. I get home, a four to six hour drive and Rochelle wants me to go back for more conference. It seems a waste of my time to turn around and go back, but I sigh and do so. By the time I get there, I am tired. I have lots of things to carry, luggage, purses, coats and so on. It will take 2 trips up the flights of stairs. I am frustrated about that. A woman says Hi. I tell her how hard this is going to be and she somewhat reluctantly agrees to carry my second load up for me. I feel guilty for manipulating her. Up we go and it is hard to do because each step is very narrow, hardly leaving enough room to place your foot. It's an extra flight up as well. By now I am very tired. I find the room and go in. The beds have the blankets folded up on the bed. I sigh. More work. I wonder which bed I should take, since Rochelle doesn't seem to be here yet. I decide to heck with it, I'll take the one I want.

["Opps. You didn't mean me."] I am lying in a bed. Another woman, my "daughter" is in the next one. It is in the middle of the night. I am tired but awake. I move the sheer curtains a bit to see the outside. It is raining hard. It looks a bit like M City out there. I say to my daughter, I love to watch the rain when I'm inside and warm and dry. I hear my "husband" George of Seinfeld coming tiptoeing into the house. He has brought several drunk women with him. One I know and another is the band singer from the lounge they were at and some of her children. Young teen girls. This is the last straw. I see George peeking around the door nervously checking to see if their giggles and drunk stumbling around has awakened me. I call him in and he lies down at the foot of the bed like a naughty puppy. I say this is it. I'm through. He groans, no. I say yes. This is no good. I'm not good for you and you're not good for me. We hurt each other. He begs with me. He holds out an old Mexican blouse, embroidered, I got from a trip to Mexico. He wants me to wear it so I'll be warmer but I say no. It doesn't fit me anymore. I wouldn't feel comfortable at all. It would, in fact, make it worse. He is very sad. Now the bad singer is in my room and seated at the piano playing. I sigh. I say please don't. I need to sleep. Then one of the girls is introduced to me. Her father is some beginning charter member of a charity organization. I am out of bed and standing by now. I commiserate with the band singer about her tough lifestyle. Then she says she is going to make a big contribution to the charity in the name of Mary Ellen. I am surprised. That is my name and I begin to demure. Then the girl speaks and I realize she is the Mary Ellen they are talking about. I am embarrassed and back away abit. Now we are someplace else. We stand in front of a full refrigerator. I see the doors are open and I say the photo would look good here with the full refrigerator. After all the charity is giving hungry people food. I stay on the outer edges of the group and watch. I feel embarrassed. (417 words)

["Weird train tracks and Mrs. Snowman's son."] A man is talking to us. He points off into the distance where I see train tracks and roads going perpendicular to us. He is complaining about these roads and tracks. He says this is what I don't like about them. Now he drags me onto the track which are unstable, no ties holding the tracks together and a long drop off below. It has bumps on the metal tracks so that I am very frightened I'll fall off as we go. He doesn't notice or care and drags me along lecturing in a complaining tone. He says this road isn't safe either and now I am next to a set of long shelves with food stacked on it like a grocery store. I am to find hand and toe holds where food isn't to hang on while a train passes so I won't get run over. I move carefully from one hand hold to another. At one point, there is no handhold and I say to the man I guess under these circumstances I just squish the food. After all, the only other alternative is for me to get squished. He nods in agreement. I get back on the path and am returning to where we were. Now we are walking out of a cafeteria where a man is at the cash register. I look back at him as we get to the doors. His back is to me and he is gossiping with the other employees. He is talking about everyone and specifically I remember he said well, I guess Mrs., Snowman's real proud of her son. Apparently Mrs. Snowman is his nick name for a cool well endowed woman that works there. He is being sarcastic. People don't really like his constant gossip. It puts people down. (300 words)

I show them to Howard and point out to him that they were photos he took of them when he was taking care of them. I was artistically cutting them out and putting them together in a collage work, where many of the photos are like pictorial totem poles, long, with many different things in a line, vertically. I realize in the back of my mind that apparently Howard and I are living together again and in fact, have sexual relations now. I feel vaguely surprised and uncomfortable. A short woman who had been having a baby in my last dream comes through and hugs me and I am shocked to realize she had passed as my husband for a short time and I am relieved I don't have to hug her. She walks on. Now I have a baby who seems hard to keep hold of. It is not too well and I'm getting it checked up. I and another woman are going to some booth where they are selling Christmas decorations. I look at them, not too interested. Boring stuff. Cloth dolls and candles. I can't seem to find the place where I take the baby for a medical check up. (223 words)

["Aliens from the Inside."] I watch a man as he is doing research. He is suspicious of a woman. Some aliens are around and he wants to question her about them to find out where they are. She is not cooperative. She is vague and slippery. He goes to her house and goes in. A maid takes him to the living room. He sees a box of journals and asks the maid if that is the woman's diaries. She says yes and then leaves. He sneaks over to read them, and as he does he realizes that the woman is really the alien. I see images of the woman's face and I watch as it transforms in a series of images to an ugly brown pop eyed alien face. The woman comes in and seems relieved he knows. It seems a friendly relationship. (139 words)

["By bike or by car?"] I am in a house. It is supposedly Lucy's home. I am cutting out articles about an incident in the newspaper. It's her newspapers and the article is about something, an accident, that happened to her. But I want them so I take them, rationalizing she can't read them anyway. I am packing to leave. I have a bike and a car. I can't decide which one I should take home with me now. I decide on the car and then change my mind and go on the bike. I coast down steep hills and pedal hard up the other side. I stop at a wayside and rest, feeling guilty about taking the articles. I should have asked permission. Now there are people around. I am going to sleep on a cot. A girl, like Charla is with me. She brings me a box of Kleenex. I say thanks and offer the little boxes inside it to others. Soon lots of people have boxes of Kleenex. Then I realize Charla had taken the box without permission and it is the supplies for the vending machine which sells these Kleenex boxes to the public. Now I owe a bunch of money for having given them all away. (206 words)

["Call 911."] I am in a house. I walk from room to room and see that all my TV sets are stolen. In their places, the thief has put smaller TV's. I ask a man, perhaps my brother Jake, where's my 32" TV set. He says he doesn't know. I am upset. A woman is there too. I then see a small baby, with blood on it's face. I realize the man has been hitting the baby. Abuse. I am more upset and realize I can't turn my face away on this. I may be week about the TV's being stolen, but I can't ignore the baby abuse. I am looking for the phone. I find it and call 911. There is a long wait. The man and the woman are very upset with me for calling 911. I am resolute. This must be done. (143 words)

["Libeled."] There is a large wedding happening and I am watching. Perhaps I am also the bride. A gangster kind of family. The family is gathered around a huge square of tables and making toasts. One man, an uncle of the groom, makes elaborate grimaces as he speaks and I watch with interest. Perhaps that is a family ritual or habit. The groom and I write a small 4 lined poem. It is amusing, about two animals, one perhaps a turtle, another perhaps a bird. We enjoyed writing it. But soon we read a critical review of the poem. The entire family, and indeed the entire town is up in arms about this poem. They ridicule me for being wrong about the theme or premise of the poem. I didn't know my subject matter, they say. I laugh and say to someone well, they have a point. I made that mistake, but I was writing the poem from another point of view and so it didn't seem to matter for what I was trying to do. The people are unforgiving. They refuse to speak to me. I am being completely ostersized. I begin by being a big embarrassed and gradually progress to anger. I demand to see the mayor. He is upstairs in a building and refuses to see me. The secretary is rude. I finally snap and push past her walking rapidly up the stairs yelling at him that I am coming up and he will talk to me. I find him in his office and threaten to sue him for civil liberties. I tell him off. (267 words)

["Communicate with the man mentally."] Two men are interested in me. They are courting me. I am not sure which one to choose. They both seem nice. The one more distant from me physically I see more. I seem to be more attracted to him. He mentally sends a group of people to come up to me and surround me. They stand very close all around me, as I am sitting. They stare at me. Somehow this is an extension of the man's mind as he learns about me. I begin to send mental signals back to him and actually start to feel what he feels and hear what he thinks. I realize I've had this capability for about a week. He is pleasantly surprised to discover I can now connect with him telepathically. I choose him and move through the people to sit next to him. We are happy. (145 words)

She tries to kiss me and flirt with me. I turn my head away and say nicely that I am not interested. I am straight. She is disappointed, but persists. I keep deflecting her energy. I think of leaving because it is tiring having to deal with the constant attention. (78 words)

["Albert Einstein and family love."] Albert Einstein is working on new inventions. He has a glass beaker full of some thick scientific liquid. He comes out of the room and announces he has found the cure for tuberculosis. His family take the new invention and carefully put it in safe keeping. They are monitoring his work so that when he dies his legacy will be intact and will be passed on to them. However, some other people come and ask him to sign over his works to them. He does so and then goes back to work. His family is deeply upset and hurt. I try to explain to them. I say, He loves you but his first love is his work. You don't matter, in the long run. They have hurt feelings. (128 words)

["Old friend returns."] I am on vacation with Dovre. We rented a couple of rooms. We are walking down an area and a man comes up to me. He has dark pretty hair and a trim beard. I realize he is an old friend from years ago. Sort of like Archie and sort of like Nat III. We hug and talk. I am happy to see him, and he me. We kiss and he is impressed, saying I am a good kisser. We walk together. He ignores his friends and I ignore Dovre because we are so immersed in one another. He changes his clothes for dinner and comes to me. I am standing at the opened trunk of a car. I comment on the nice sweater he is wearing. It is knitted and white. A cardigan. He is embarrassed. Someone gave it to him, he doesn't particularly like it. I say in defense, well, it looks very collegiate. We walk over to my rooms, so I can get ready for the dinner. I show him each room. The living room, the bath room. The stairway to the bedroom. The bedroom. Dovre goes to take a shower and we fall upon each other and make wild love. (204 words)

["Don't neglect the babies."] I am now responsible for two babies that my mother had but doesn't pay any attention to any more. She's had other babies and lavishes care on them but neglects the first ones. I resent this and feel bad for the abandoned babies. The same thing happens with Lucy. I am taking care of her first babies too. I try to explain to her that she is neglecting them. She doesn't seem to care or hear it. In my explanation, I use a horizontal metal bar that is a part of her couch we sit on. I say horizontal. She thinks about it and uses the baby's legs as an axis to get a spatial picture of horizontal versus vertical. She traces a line across the spread legs and says Christmas, right? (132 words)

["Taking Classes"] I am taking some classes, mostly figure drawing. I talk with a woman who wants to know what classes I'll take next term. I have no idea, since I'm just taking a class that interests me, but I can tell she wants me to graduate and take all the required courses. I evade the question, saying something general like "Art Classes, I think." (63 words)

["Too much stuff."] I'm in a public building, having helped someone teach a class. A student needs their schoolwork gathered up and delivered to them. I see a table with piles of papers and books. I begin to dig out what I think I should take to her. A woman comes. She is my ride and then another class lets out and people are walking through. It is necessary for me to get out of the way but at the last moment I decide to grab some of the papers I want for a later meeting. I shuffle through the piles having a hard time deciding what to take. I feel frustrated. I give up and decide not to do this, and not take much with me. I walk out to my waiting ride. (131 words)

["Creating Music for my program"] I am in a house, apparently one my mother, my father, and Dwight live in. I am working on my computer project. I realize I need music to go with it. I smile at my father as he walks through the living room. I hint that he should write me some original music. He laughs and says no way. That would take too long. I then comment that if I get music from someone else, it will be copyrighted. He doesn't take the hint and leaves the room. I go down a hall to visit Dwight's room. He's hanging out. He has no suggestions for me. (106 words)

["Steve McQueen and me."] Steve McQueen is cool and aloof. He has all the women falling for him. I am a shy young woman and know I haven't a chance with him. But he seems to be attracted to me in a casual way. He lets me hang out with him. He insists I cut my hair very short. It already is a short ball of curls, with multiple colors in it. His mother laughs at me as she mimics snipping my hair down to the scalp. She takes a snip out of it in the front. I go to him and say why do I have to cut my hair? I like it this way. This is pretty brave of me. He grins and I know it's ok. (125 words)

The others are set up all ready. We climb up to the door using a metal ladder attached to the wall. It is a difficult climb. The rungs are thin and bend easily. I now find my space. My desk is set up right by the fireplace. I announce I like this space. The space to my right is my "father's." He's dead. I see a man's figure sitting at his desk. All I see is his back. I call out to my father's spirit. I then see a bright opaque swirl of colored lights on the ceiling. I tell the others this is my father's spirit. (141 words)

["Rape and Kill."] I am in my bedroom. I get up and go into the bathroom. Carlos comes in with the intent to rape me. He grabs me and I struggle. I shove him away and escape into the living room. He now has a gun. I call 911. I can barely see and my movements are slow motion. I try to remember my address. I finally remember 2nd and Elm. It's like my memory is going. Then I remember 2127. Carlos is approaching and I start to duck and hide in the computer room. There is a blue mat standing on its side. I hide behind that. Carlos is near. I grab the gun. He wounds me. I now have the gun and Carlos is lying on the ground. And still trying to hurt me. I finally shoot him in the shoulder. Now I feel angry and righteous. I have the right to kill him. I feel some restraint of compassion but it is small compared to the desire to kill him. I shoot him three more times in unvital areas. Finally, the police arrive, but it now looks like I am the aggressor and they want to arrest me. Carlos grins and tells them I tried to seduce him and then attacked him. I am furious. (215 words)

["Don't want a boyfriend."] I have moved into a house. I don't like the town, a small traditional place out in the country. Dovre is there, helping me, only she put my rug that belongs on the living room floor over the rug I already have on the bedroom floor and then the excess goes out into the living room. It is wrinkled and messy. I am unhappy about that. I go into the bathroom, as I just woke up. I look out a window and see a huge diesel truck near by. The driver is looking in out of curiosity. I am annoyed. I go out for a walk. When I return, I see a glass enclosed porch where women are cooking. I realize it is my kitchen. I go into the house. The women call me into the kitchen. They say the townsmen are ready to look me over now. They are interested in courting me. I don't want that. I am annoyed again. I leave the glass kitchen and go into a living room where five men are seated, waiting for me. I shake each one's hands and say Hello. I feel uncomfortable. I don't want any of these men. I don't want anyone. I want them to go away. (209 words)

I say to my Aunt Millie, look. Do you see it? She grins. She makes ugly faces at me, sticking out her tongue in grotesque ways. I ask her not to do that. It scares me. She keeps it up. (70 words)

["Saving the Enterprise."] The USS Enterprise is basically a huge body of water. I am a crew member. We must abandon ship. I am swimming up to the air. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard accompanies me to the surface and then turns to go back down to try and save the ship from exploding. He turns to his left and says "Michael." The Warf character is there. He also volunteers to go back down. They swim down to a sandy silt ledge where yet another crew member is pacing back and forth, guarding. His feet are silly, like a clowns. There are three objects down there and they are going to explode. Capt. Orders the others to go up to the surface with two of the objects. He stays behind to bring up the third one, the most dangerous. It is on the verge of exploding so he releases it and pushes it to the right. That momentum forces him into the same path. The thing explodes. I think the Capt. Survives. (167 words)

["Tidal waves and saving the babies."] Raging tidal waves of brown roiling water is descending on me. People are running, screaming. I am running. I see naked brown babies being swept away. I am afraid for them. A woman runs past a baby. I grab the baby and I yell, "I will take care of the babies." I am being righteously indignant and feeling put upon. I am angry at her for abandoning them to their fate. I know I can't save them all, but I manage one or two, even though my instinct is to save myself and leave them behind. (96 words)

["Is it OK to be lovers?"] Ricardo and I are seated side by side in a vehicle. I am where the drivers seat is and he is on my right. He is much younger than me. He leans over to kiss my belly. He nuzzles a little roll of fat on my side. I feel awkward and uncomfortable. I wonder if this will be OK with his parents. I tell him we should ask his parents permission. His father shrugs and says I guess it's all right. His mother says no way. This is wrong. I don't approve. Ricardo still wants us to make love. He brings me a small metal boat and holds it steady in a pond. I start to get in it. We are going to float around on the pond to be alone. But the boat is unstable and Ricardo is rocking it around. So water is splashing in. I hesitate, not wanting to get in and sink. So he brings a small kayak. It is also unsteady. Now he is walking around in the shallow pond, away from me. I walk toward him, wading. I look down into the water and I see something swimming by. I look more closely and see that it is a woman who is either sleeping or stoned on drugs. She is smiling. Another young woman is floating with her, in the same condition. I am concerned for them. What if they are so unconscious that they drown. I keep walking toward Ricardo, but I keep looking back at the women, concerned. I see another set of women like that. Now I am carefully walking over a fallen tree trunk, very old and gnarled. It is ancient and beautiful. There are currents and eddies and odd mysterious things in this pond and Ricardo seems to keep disappearing further away as I observe what is around me. (310 words)

["Black baby is eaten."] I enter a room. I see a plump, cute black baby lying there. He is sucking on a pacifier vigorously. He has it all the way in his mouth. I remove it but he wants it, so I find a bigger one, with a shield on it. He sucks on it so hard it slips completely into his mouth. I am worried he will choke. I take it out. I pick him up and hold him. He smiles. I look in his eye. It has mechanical little squares in it. I am surprised. Is this an alien baby? I put him down. I look around the room. I look back at him and notice he has changed into a snail like creature. Another odd animal is beside him. As I watch in horror, the animal eats the snail. I am sick with horror. I try to grab the animals mouth but it is too late. I wonder how I can possibly tell the baby's mother he was eaten while I was caring for him. I am shocked and worried. (179 words)

["More rooms"] I am in some house. It is small and old. It has two tiny bedrooms, a kitchen and a living room. I am walking through the rooms to see where the bedrooms are. As I walk through the house, I keep finding more rooms. One is a tiny thing where the floor is rotten through. I look down and see a busy industrial establishment. A large truck drives through as I watch. I wonder if the exhaust fumes come up into my house. I see Lucy walking near this room and am concerned she will fall through the rotten spaces in the floor. In the kitchen I see a hutch with things on it. I want to move it so it will look better. I go into another room, surprised to find another one. Terence is around somewhere. (138 words)

["Getting ready."] I am walking with my father and some other people. We are going to go check up on a project we are working on. Maybe a computer project. We stop to have a bite to eat. My father asks a man to bring us a prepared lunch. I open mine, and find a bunch of square things with general information on them. I see packages of cheese or milk. I ask a man if every time I want to eat lunch I will get this same package of square informational things. He says yes. That seems a real waste of resources. (101 words)

["Falling in love with a drag queen"] I am very sad. I feel alone and unloved. I am in some tunnel of cement and curved lines. A naked black man is there and he is sympathetic to my feelings. He walks ahead of me trying to coax me into following him to see a friend who can supportively counsel me. I think there is an underground river to the left that I was sitting next to. I slowly follow him. He tries to jump up a cement jut where the tunnel branches into two. He slips and falls on his butt. He laughs at his antics. He's trying to cheer me up. I feel sad and lonely. Now he leads me to a friend. Sparky. She says she'd like to hear what's troubling me. Another woman is there who was going to tell her troubles but she says it's OK for me to go ahead first. She'll learn from my situation too. I suddenly decide to not talk and let the woman go first. I wonder why I did this, because it would be right and a good thing for me to talk. But I hold myself in. The black man is now dressed as a drag queen. He cavorts around in a flashy way. I am now trying to adjust my clothes. I have a skirt that rides up into my butt crack and a see through blouse so it is obvious. I keep trying to adjust it, but it reverts back as soon as I let go of it. This feels embarrassing. I can't walk around looking like this. So I try to put a pair of jeans on. I stand up and walk over to the black drag queen and straddle his lap. I say I don't know what I'm supposed to be a man inside and a woman outside, or a woman outside and a man inside. I feel confused. Then I say to him. What would happen if I loved a drag queen? Would I have to just wait until he's ready? (340 words)

["Washing dishes with the Native Americans"] We finished some kind of big dinner. Theresa is there and other Native Americans. Time for clean up. We walk into the kitchen. I choose to wash instead of dry. The sink, a big industrial sized one, is full of dishes already soaking in warm soapy water. I wash as Theresa and I talk, pleasantly. I get the dishes done and look over at the stove. There are lots of very dirty dried on food pans waiting. I don't want to wash them. We decide to soak them. I tell Theresa we should put away the food so it won't spoil. She says she'll slice up her turkey and we'll put it away. Then I'm in the next room setting up some pieces of papers on a table. We are going to do collage like art work. Lots of people, maybe the whole tribe will be involved doing this. I chat with some nice guy. (155 words)

["Cat Baby"] I suddenly remember I haven't been feeding the baby for a few days. A girl like Charla is there and I ask her if she did it. She says no. I walk into the bedroom and see the baby in it's crib, still in the swing harness from the day. I get the baby up. I walk around holding the baby in my arms, only now there are two of them. A cat had changed into a baby. The baby that was a cat is plumper and healthier than the other baby. The real baby has red circles under it's eyes. I carry them around with me, one in the crook of each arm. I want to take care of them good, now and am appalled I neglected them so long. I just forgot to take care of them. I walk into another room and with my foot pull out a trundle bed from the couch. I want to put them there to nap. A man is there, he is a neighbor, but we actually live in the same part of the building. His bedroom door is to the right. Which opens into the room I'm in and my bedroom is off the same room on the left. (208 words)

["Younger man"] I am standing near a young man, maybe 20 years my junior. He is some kind of sports person and I am watching his workout. We are attracted to each other. He asks me to sort out some papers for him. I do that. I wonder if we are going to sleep together that night. I assume we will, but no one has actually said the words. I have a wooden tent like accommodations all picked out in case. He says his Mother lives near by. We can stay at her house tonight. I ask if she is going to mind us being together. He smiles and says it doesn't matter. I know now we are going to sleep together. The age difference bothers me a bit. (127 words)

["Walking."] I am walking and it is somewhat difficult because I usually go in a wheelchair. I am walking down a sidewalk. An older unkempt woman is in a wheelchair on the sidewalk. She grudgingly gets up and steps aside so I can walk on the sidewalk. She is annoyed with me. I continue. Now I see a woman evangelist sitting on a large wooden structure. She is preaching to one lone woman seated on a bench across from her. The listening woman looks bored. I pass between them. As I continue, I see other people standing around on the sidewalk. I walk with effort and concentration, kind of surprised I can manage this long. (114 words)

["Turn off the radio"] Charla and I are going to a special meeting at her school on Sunday. I keep trying to position my wheelchair so I can face the two women speakers. I can't seem to find them. I decide I need to turn off the radio, it is annoying me. I find the radio and push a number of buttons but no matter which one I push it won't turn off. I feel frustrated and I give up. Now I am outside and walking. It is slippery. I see a stream of water ahead and realize I can't step over it. So I choose to go uphill, slipping on the wet grass and mud. I make it to the sidewalk. I see the bus Charla and I will take. Now a young woman, perhaps Dovre, and I are wearing push up halter tops that are black and strapless. I mold mine to hold in my left breast, as I noticed it was sort of dropping out a bit. As I approach the bus, a man approaches and makes lewd remarks. I feel annoyed by him. (183 words)

["Growing computers."] I am in a field planting old computers in a row. I finish my work and look over the field where many green plants are thriving. I pick off a flowering fruit that is forming. I taste it and am very pleased. It is moist and sweet and slightly crunchy. Someone asks me what this all is. I point out the beginning of the first row and say that was a Compaq computer, and that was an old Commodore 64. It even has the old fashioned keyboard with the shift button on the left. There is an Atari. (98 words)

["Secret bus"] I am walking in an open area. I see some boxes and racks with used items there. I dig around and find a purse and a sundress. I am going to buy them, but then I notice the purse's handle is missing and has a seam open. The dress doesn't have an elastic waist, so I won't fit into it. I decide to leave them, although I like the openings on the purse. I can manage them with my hands. There are people there that are part of a secret group, called the MOI. I follow them, searching for their secret headquarters. I see a bus and get on it. I am now in a wheelchair and notice the bus is very spacious, allowing great accessibility for the chair. I see a display panel and look at it closely. I find an ensignia of the MOI there and realize I have found their secret place. I continue to casually observe as I wheel down the aisle which is a grassy path. There are no visible signs of the bus. No floors, or walls. It looks like I'm strolling down a meadow path. At the back end of the bus, I see some young men in suits who are part of the MOI crew. I notice they have sleeping quarters and a bathroom set up back there. They watch me suspiciously. I pretend to be an innocent tourist. (237 words)

["Saving Bill Clinton"] Charla and I live at the White House. Bill and I are going to be married. Charla is talking and says "Sex." I am nervous and ask her not to mention sex. The reporters will pick up on that and make rumors about Charla and Bill Clinton. I then worry that my warning her will sensitize her to do it more often for attention. The preparations for the wedding is going on in the main room. A woman is there and I realize she is the killer that is trying to destroy Bill. I and Charla convince her to come upstairs to a room to talk. She agrees. The stairs are outside the house. We are in this room, and she grabs me to poison me. She is behind me and I struggle. I manage to get the poison she is trying to kill me with, into her mouth and she dies. I go down the stairs and find Bill. He is wearing a white suit. Most of the rooms are white. We hug. I say to him, I've killed her. He is shocked. I say it was self defense. He hugs me again. He is very happy. (198 words)

["Giraffes in the new house"] I am looking over a series of rooms I am thinking of moving into. The rooms are run down and as I go from one room to another, I notice they aren't closed off from the rest of the building. I walk from one room into another not realizing I had entered someone else's room. I back out, embarrassed. I choose one room to be Charla's bedroom. Now Robert Downing is there. He is my son. He wants to move in with us. I am hesitant. He's an addictive personality and trouble, but he is my son. We enter another room and I see a glass display case with jewelry in it. I am pleased to find something the previous owners left. I don't particularly like the jewelry itself. I comment they will make good Christmas gifts for friends. I see a pile of wooden carved giraffes. I am very happy. I say oh good, these are my totem animals. This is a good omen. We walk down another hall to reexamine Charla's room. It is big but the hall from it simply opens out into the building. I don't like that. Now Robert and I walk outside the building to return to the first room. Each room is in a different building, it seems. (215 words)

["Fireworks and cute critters"] I am in a room. I ask where my father is. They say he's up on the hill setting off the fireworks so we can enjoy them. I look out a high wide window and see fireworks and black puffs of smoke. I notice it is daylight and ask why he didn't wait for night so we could see them better. The colors are faded. Someone says it's because some people who would enjoy this won't be here later. I go sit on a couch. I see an odd critter, sort of like a furry deer with a flat wide head. I am sure it will run away if I reach out to pet it. I touch it and suddenly it leaps up on the couch beside me and wants to be petted more. Very affectionate. I am amused. It is cute. (142 words)

["Sneaking a Peek"] I am talking with some nice man. I kind of like him. He has a locker and I happen to notice the combination numbers he uses to lock it. I decide to sneak into his locker and look around. I do that and pull out books and papers and his drawing pad. I am hoping I find some journal entry that talks about his meeting me and how he feels about me. But I am embarrassed and feel guilty. So I barely look as I flip through the pages. I know this isn't right. I notice he is a very good artist. Lovely colorful pictures. I put the things back in the locker. I realize he will know someone has been rifling through his things because I can't remember where things were, exactly. I want to go hide. I feel shamed. Now either I have to go confess to him or not get involved with him, because I couldn't handle the thought of being dishonest with him. I am sorry I ever opened his locker. I feel sad because now I've ruined a possibly good relationship. (186 words)

["The Horse Breaks a Leg"] I am in a room. There are two or three fireplaces. There is a huge stone hearth in front of the fireplaces. A fire burns in each fireplace. As I watch, I see bits of burnt wood spark out onto the hearth. I am grateful it lands on the stone and not on the floor or the couch. I move the couch away from the fireplace. It is on a downhill slant. I don't like that. I look at the stone wall near the fireplace. It has sparkling places. I look more closely and see quartz crystals and amethyst crystals which reflect the fire. It is pretty. I look over at the other fireplace. I see smoke pouring out of it, into the room. Now I am worried about toxic smoke inhalation. I say I need a fan and then see a button on the wall. I turn it on and a fan starts up. It clears out the smoke. I then see a black device on the wall. I look more closely. It appears to be some kind of camera lens with a series of f-stops on the multiple lenses. I have no idea what it does. Now there are aliens in the room. One has a round fat tummy. I don't want him to stand so close to me that we touch. He leans forward and touches his small purple tongue to my mouth. I pull back, feeling uncomfortable. Then I look out the window. I hear some people playfully racing their horses down the street. But they are careless. One horse slips and falls badly. I feel sick when I hear him fall. I look and see that his back legs are bend. I think he's broken his legs and will have to be shot. I feel very upset and distressed for the horse who was driven carelessly and must now pay with pain and perhaps death. The horses face is full of suffering and pain. I want to cry. (333 words)

["God Help ME"] I am observing a young woman who has two boyfriends. One is her main boyfriend, and the other is a new one that she is attracted to and he to her. She is quite torn as to which one she loves more. She is miserable. She and her woman friend are in a crowded restaurant. The woman friend sees her boyfriend, and picks up a coffee pot, a gift from the other man and holds it up for him to see. She calls to him to get his attention. The young woman is shocked and angry. She says How could you do that!. The friend follows the boyfriend outside repeating her message. The boyfriend is extremely upset and hurt. The young woman walks angrily back into the crowded restaurant. Her friend returns with her. The restaurant is crowded with waiters who stand on top of each other's shoulders and wait tables in this acrobatic way. The boyfriend places himself in a harness that holds him suspended up from the floor about three feet. He is sort of like the waiters, doing a showy act for the customers. But while he is there, he arches his back in frustration yelling repeatedly "God help ME!" Meaning let me be the one she stays with. (212 words)

["Keeping the Animals Safe"] I own a large run down house where I keep exotic animals. Lion cubs and a sort of furry dinosaur, and many other animals. I let them roam free. The house has a long front yard that goes to the ocean. In the house are stone outcroppings just like outdoors. I use them as sort of stairs. Some of the house is unfinished. The stones lead up to a wall for example. The dinosaur goes wild and is potentially harmful. I need to put it up in a room in the house. I struggle to get it up there. I feel bad that I have to lock it or any of the animals up like in a zoo. I am enjoying the fresh air in the yard and notice a lion cub is loose. I am concerned it will be hurt by the dinosaur. I pick it up, cuddling it. As I am walking around with it, I see two men who are going to harm the animals. Now the dinosaur is loose and swimming in the ocean. I get into the passenger side of the car. The two men are in the driver's seat. I pull out a shotgun and point it at their heads. I say if you don't stop, I'll blow your heads off. They smirk. I aim at their shoulder and shoot. This scares them and they jump out the open window on the driver's side. The car is moving fast and I struggle to get into the driver's seat to stop it before we plummet into the ocean. Too late. I feel the impact of hitting the water. I feel the sinking of the car in the deep water. I am also aware that the impact is softer than it would be normally. I struggle out of the window and start to swim back to shore, with my shotgun in my hand, on the lookout for the men. I see one up on a hill. I return to the house and run up a long flight of stairs. I see my staff, now a large group, working. I warn them about the men. (358 words)

["A Sad Story of Love and Betrayal, 1940's style"] I watch a young woman and I am sort of the young woman. We live in an apartment building. My room is sort of open to the hall. I have a single bed and it faces a wall partition that has a box on it, with things from the previous owner on it. The place is cluttered. I am cleaning up. I open a box with magazines in it I had been saving for a long time. I open one magazine. I see cut out pictures of a cute dog. It is black and white. It is called a pop eyed dog. I like the picture but resist keeping it. I throw it away, even though I think it is cute. I see the box on the wall has holes in it and look in. There are shelves in there with lots of stuff on them. I start rearranging things. I fold up a cardboard cutout of a miniature piece of furniture. I think it is a dresser. I see framed pictures on the wall. I don't particularly like them. They were left by the previous owner and I never bothered to take them down. A man comes into my area. I try to ignore him. I don't like him. He lives in a neighboring apartment. I see him sit on a bed next to mine and I watch as he does stretching exercises. I see he has a thick build, like Ernest Borgnine. But his legs are very thin and lacking muscle, like a para. He is dressed in a T-shirt and his boxer shorts. I roll under the bed to pretend to sleep and avoid him. Now I am walking down the hall of this old 1940's style apartment building. The neighbor man is attracted to me and calls me into his room on some pretense. After we are in there, he unbuttons my dress and exposes my breasts. I the dreamer is looking on. I am surprised to see her breasts are so small, they are practically non existent. The man wants to fondle her. She is upset and runs out of the room to escape. She runs across the hall and into the bedroom of another man who is sleeping. She kind of likes him. He has been kind to her. He is in bed sleeping and she crawls in beside him saying in sobs, can I sleep here? He is surprised. I the dreamer is surprised and pleased to see it is the actor Al Pacino playing a role of a working class man. He has a gap in his teeth. I am delighted with his acting skills of taking on this unusual role for him. He at first assumes she wants sex and tries to touch her breasts. She is curled up and says no. I just want to sleep here. He sees she is upset and allows her to lie there as he comforts her. Meanwhile, I see the father coming down the hall. He is going to find them sleeping together and assume the worst. He is going to go after the man and force him away. It is a sad story. (530 words)

["Another time, swept away."] My brother Dwight and I are on a raft in some river. We are right next to the bank, which goes straight up like a cliff. There is a canopy roof over us. I notice beautiful waterfalls, like sheets of running water over the face of the cliff and point them out to Dwight. Then I suddenly realize we are in danger. The water is increasing. One sprouts up right next to us. I yell to Dwight to help me get the raft out from under the canopy before the water rises suddenly. We just barely get out in time. We are moving downstream when a wall of water comes washing down and over us. It pushes the raft and us over a cliff into a huge lake. It is so big that I can't see the land anywhere. Then I see smoke stacks way off to the left. Then I see some houses with spires on them and cars near by on the right. I think to myself that there can't be cars here because somehow we had traveled back in time. The cars disappear. We move to the dock near the houses. And get out on land. A young man comes up and an older couple. They are dressed like in the 1600's. Pilgrims sort of. They are upset that I am wearing pants. I go back to the raft and find a dress, it's not in their style, but it's a dress. They ask us to come in. We do so. A plump woman asks us if we are married and I laugh and say no. She is shocked and faints. I then hastily explain we are brother and sister. This is a very religious family. We are now eating dinner with them. They finish and say they will now go have a family prayer meeting. We are left at the table alone. The young man peeks in from the door to the outside and asks us to meet with his friends secretly outside. They have some secret revolutionary group going. We go out. The steps are very steep and at the bottom, the young man catches me in his arms. We cling to each other, very attracted to each other. Then we scramble over a small hill and hide with the others. Now I see three geeky men, dressed like cowboys. The are standing in a row by a fence. One comes up to me. He wants to kiss me out of curiosity. I see the young man jealously watching and I decide I want to make him jealous. I agree to the kiss, but the young man is angry now and comes over to grab me from the man's arms. We embrace and cling to each other fiercely. He professes his love and now sad and lonely he will be when I return from where ever I came from. We are deeply in love and sad. (491 words)

["Letters from Brian, wish I knew who he was."] I am working hard and feel very tired. I fluff up some pillows and prepare to rest on a big easy chair. Another woman friend is also tired and takes my place. I see this and happily give up my spot for the other side of the chair. There are two large holes in the corners of the chair and I stuff a big brown pillow in it and arrange a few more for comfort. I curl up. Now I get up to look for some letters I received. I had gotten a postcard from someone named Brian and I wrote back. Only I can't remember who Brian is. I got three letters. Big fat ones. My name Beverley is written three times across the envelope. I am excited about receiving these letters. They look like they will be fun to read and full of information from the past. I try to think who Brian is. Maybe an elementary school chum. Maybe I met him at Aunt Millie's. I open his letter. He has a whole list of facts about my Grandma Agnes' family on this paper. I begin to eat the paper. It tastes very good. I then realize that I am eating the facts before I even read them. I don't want to lose the information, so I nibble around the margins, because I really like the taste of this paper. It is crunchy like potato chips. (239 words)

["Like the Kennedy family."] I am a young woman who visits a very large family. There are perhaps 11 or more adult children and the male head of the family. It reminds me of the Kennedy family. We are called into a large room with three or four couches. They all sit on the couches and I am amazed at how much furniture is required for so large a family. The older man lectures to his children. At one point he walks up to the son and leans into his face and says sex. He means they shouldn't be thinking about sex and relationships, but getting on with their careers. He then comes over to me to get acquainted. I need a crochet hook to make something. He walks me over to his daughter who is severely disabled in a wheelchair. He leans over to her and says No Tim. He means she shouldn't be thinking of her boyfriend Tim. They help me find some crochet hooks. But they are all too big. I see the size J. I need smaller. We search around for awhile. The son comes over to talk. He is attracted to me, as I think the father is. I am shy. (202 words)

["Center of Attention"] I am seated in a large crowd of people. Way up at the top of the bleachers are the important people who perform. I am leaning back on the ample bosom of an older woman, feeling relaxed and comfortable. I watch a man doing a performance. He is racing on the ice covered ground, running from something that could get him.The man tries very hard but doesn't quite make it. Now the important woman at the top of the bleachers is making a public speech about his performance. She then suddenly starts talking about me and how I will criticizes his work because I am always critical in a negative way. I am surprised and angry she speaks like this about me in public. I stand up and announce that I am not critical of his performance. I in fact think it was wonderful. The fact that he almost but not quite made it successfully was even an added plus to the excitement and poignancy of the performance. I am furious at the woman and stare up at her. The older woman and a younger woman seated next to us are very aware I may blow up and be caustic in my speech with this woman. They are trying to calm me down. But I stand up and walk toward the woman who is descending the stairs. I grab her with a cane behind the neck and jerk her around and force her to the wall. I lean into her and tell her off, angrily. How dare she berate me in public and so on. Then I walk away in a huff. When I sit back down, a woman comes up to me and says look at that. You did it again. Two years ago, you sat on the stage itself, and was the center of attention. Last year, you accidentally sat with the important people and was the center of attention. And now you managed it again!!

["Bone Density"] I am watching as a woman is standing in the street, shocked that she has survived a holocaust. She says I must have had enough bone density. Millions of people had been killed because they didn't have it. She is relieved she has survived, but she watches as other survivors search for their loved ones. They come into a huge warehouse to search through millions of bones and skeletons. There is no hope they can identify one from the other, it is an overwhelming task. The woman and I look on in sadness and empathy as a crying grieving woman hopelessly goes to the bone pile to try against all odds to find her loved ones. (116 words)

["Reaching for God"] I am at a church service that is very beautiful. After the service, two other women and I walk to another church. Our belief is that our own service is so right and beautiful that we can go to other kinds of services and enjoy them without judgment. We go to another church where an old man is the preacher. He is talking on a microphone off in a corner but his voice is booming through the congregation, sort of like the old man in the Wizard of Oz who is revealed behind the curtain. He is saying that there are 8 paintings that are sacred and special. As the women and I leave, we say it's interesting. Not like our service. But it's OK if they want to believe that God is a painter. We walk across a top of some high cardboard like we're on top of a cardboard box. We are going to the next church. We come to the end of the cardboard and there is a steep ladder. I am in high heels. I shake my head no. I say I don't know what I was thinking, not taking the elevator. I can't go down this ladder. Will you be upset with me if I don't go with you to the next church? They smile and say no problem. I turn and walk back toward the elevator. I see a man. We talk. I hug him and am in his lap. I say to him. I love you. The man is distressed. I say don't be upset. It's all right if you don't return my love. I do this twice. Now I feel like dancing. I find a spot on the gymnasium like floor where it's not as crowded and begin to dance like I'm Ice Skating. I swirl and glide gracefully. People stop to look. Someone puts a spotlight on me. As part of the dance, I leap up to grab hold of a crystal chandelier. This represents reaching for God. It is beautiful. The crowd admires my dancing. I am touched by the motion of reaching for God. It is very spiritual. (359 words)

["Nate in the photo"] A woman has taken a photo of Nate and I and another woman. She shows it to me. It is already printed up in a newspaper. I like the picture, but I am uneasy. I say to her that Nate and I used to be lovers and maybe his wife will see the picture and put it together. Nate comes in and I show him the picture, explaining what I told the woman. He smiles and says it's probably OK to print the picture. Since the other woman is in the middle between us, the wife won't figure it out. It looks perfectly normal and explainable. (106 words)

["Center of Attention"] I have a black suitcase, more like a briefcase. It has a game inside it. You push a button and round disks, brown colored and sandpaper like, move around. I get bored easily with this game since nothing much seems to happen. Perhaps it is broken. I open up the case and clean everything out of it. I have a bunch of quarters and odds and ends. I gather up the quarters. I hear John Lithgow talking to another man. He is telling him that he shouldn't be such a hog with the center of attention in the group circle. I smile at the fact that it is John himself that seems to need to be the center of attention and he is jealous of the other fellow's share. (129 words)

["Sawdust Eating MaMa"] I am in a garage with Charla. She wants to drive my little red car. She gets into the driver's seat. I don't want her to drive. I tell her she is only 11 years old. But she starts driving anyway, in the garage. Slowly moving forward, she bumps into a large box. She then backs up and bumps into something else. I finally take the steering wheel from her and stop the car. I am sitting in the driver's seat and I feel a strong wind pushing at my back. It's a breezy garage. Now I am walking with my "father." He is human, but my "mother" was a sawdust eating creature. We walk across a flatland area to a huge tunneled out building in a mountain. The halls are white, long and endless. There are unmarked doors where businesses are. Other people and creatures are walking through the halls to get to their work place. I see a big room ahead, no door but a wide archway opening to it. Some of the creatures think this is the sawdust eating room, but as we get closer, I see it is a swim pool. The water is steamy and cloudy and murky. My father and I get in and swim around. The others go to the sawdust eating room. (220 words)

["Rushing waters, against the current"] I am in a large room that is crammed full of boxes of things displayed like in a store. I see rows and stacks of boxes with shoes on them and I see dark figurines of horse's heads and so on. I need to clean this place up. I see a pile of clothes and start picking them up to put away. Several pants of pastel colors and design are on an ironing board. I haven't worn them for a long time and had forgotten I owned them. I am interested in wearing them again. Now I walk out of the room through a door out to a porch which is in a huge cavern. A river rushes through it right up to the porch. I can see the currents are strong. Even though it is dark in there. I jump into the cold river and try to swim across. But the current is too strong and sweeps me downstream. I manage to get to the side which is a rock face wall. I fight my way walking upstream against the current holding on to little handholds in the rock face. I look up stream and see that a large waterfall is at the upstream end where the water enters the cavern. Now I am in the middle of the river and walking upstream, managing to move OK even though the current is still strong. (235 words)

I am unhappy. (66 words)

["Hard to See"] I am trying to iron a dress which has wrinkles in it from being wadded up in a pile of things for too long. I sit in a regular chair with my wheelchair beside me on the left. I have trouble seeing. It's like I have a blindfold over my eyes and trouble with my right eye. I catch bits and glimpses of things but am a bit disoriented. I feel the wheelchair and try to use touch to find my way around. Lucy and Mary Sue are there. I am explaining to them about my visual problem. They listen but are a bit bored as this is common experience for them. I go outside to walk and Lucy comes with me. I can see better now and tell her there are some holes in the boards we will be walking on. We can't walk around it because just underneath on the right side is a large body of water. We must be cautious and careful with our steps. (169 words)

["Jake sings Opera"] I am in a room, dressing. Ernie comes to the door and I am only in a long sweat shirt, no undies or pants. I feel self-conscious. At least the shirt is long enough to cover my private parts. He comes in and we talk. We are going somewhere. Two men are working outside the open window. As we start to leave, I become concerned that I should lock the window so no one will come in and steal anything. I say apologetically to the men, it's not that I think you will steal anything. We go out into the hall and then drop down through a hole which is like an elevator shaft without the elevator. We land on a piece of furniture in someone's living room. I am embarrassed. They look at us. I apologize saying we thought we were going to land in a lobby or something like that. We go outside. Some woman had driven a car down this road and we were looking for her. I think she is up in a tall building with lots of windows. Now we are in another room, like a bar. Lots of people. Some of the people are doing amateur talent skits and songs. I see Jake off to the left back corner and he is playing a record or tape of classical music. He manipulates the tape with his right hand. Then he bursts into operatic song. It is kind of silly and I am impressed with his native ability. I am surprised he had the courage to do this, as he hates to make a fool of himself. I applaud and shout out Bravo! Some man on my right thinks Jake sounds silly and I am silly for applauding him. (294 words)

["Many rooms, remodel."] I am moving into a house. I am walking through the rooms to look it over. There is a great deal of work to do to make it livable. The plywood is rotting, it's old and dusty. I am amazed at how many rooms there are and how large they are. I open a boarded up window and look down to see a huge basement room, with dead leaves on the floor. Patricia and Aunt Elaine come to visit. I am showing them the house. We move now toward the front rooms of the house. Here they are in better shape. Elaine exclaims, oh, here's an other door. It's on the other side of the entry. I open it. It has some wallpaper and is very spacious. I like it. I see four doors. I open the one on the left. And find myself in a clothing retail store. A sales woman rushes over to shoo us back into my room. She follows us in. I say to her, does this other door go into the store too? She says no. I open the door that has a ramp with shallow steps built on it. I see a flight of stairs being renovated, fresh cement being laid down on the steps. I close the door, trying to lock the little flimsy lock. It keeps falling back into an open position. When I locked it, the hinges on the other side of the door pulled out a bit. Then I tried the next door. A closet. I didn't see anything in it. I didn't like how it felt to look in there. The last door is another closet. I open the door and four heavy golden brown men's overcoats fall out on the floor, just like four dead bodies. I am startled and a little afraid. I tell Elaine that this room will be for Howard and me. But I was thinking I want Howard in another room and this room is for me. Now Patricia is outside driving a VW bus. The sales woman runs to the window to look disapprovingly at her. Elaine and I go look. She is driving around in the front parking lot. (367 words)

["Princess Meets Mud Man"] I am a young Arab kind of princess. I am outside playing. My old grandfather, the King is watching. He is proud of my beauty and my energy. I have been a child and am now becoming a woman. I have long dark black hair. I turn cartwheels and run happily through the grass. Grandfather goes in to palace. I am walking back to the front door when I see in the ground a small hole. In the hole is a man's face in a pool of water. He has beautiful brown eyes. His image recedes under water as I approach. I go into the palace and ask for my Grandfather. No one responds to me. They bustle around very busy. I go toward his bedroom. I enter a room and then turn left and enter yet another room. He is there, very ill, in a white hospital bed. It is very high up and big. There is white netting all around the bed. I walk around the bed trying to find a way to get close to him. I finally command a servant to lower the bed. He does so. I hold my dying Grandfather's hand and I tell him of the mud man. We guess it is a spy from the other kingdom which wants to take over our kingdom. My grandfather decides that when he dies, he will make me queen, skipping the men of his command. He smiles at me and then dies. The men are not happy about this sudden change. (256 words)

["Multi-colored stairs and the dating game"] I am in the back of a pickup truck. Ellie is driving. She is driving very fast and I am being bumped around badly. I am in danger of being bounced out of the truck and injured. I am angry and scared. I yell at her to slow down. She pays no attention. There are two round cylinders in segments. I have my hands on them, holding them so they won't fall apart. Each segment seems to represent an amount of money. I think it was $100. Now Ellie and I are walking across some very high walkway with a metal railing. I sarcastically ask if she took this like she takes everything else. Now we are climbing down some metal structure. I look down. It is an endless drop if I fall. I several times take the wrong foothold and swing around precariously, nearly falling. Finally, I see a long endless flight of stairs with multi-colored thin stripes going vertically in the carpet. I have a hard time getting on the first step without falling. Then I am fine but it is a long way to go. Too bad the elevator is broken. As I descend the stairs, I look to my right and see lots of people seated in rows. I go into that room and they point at me and I wave at them. I don't pay any attention to them, just vacantly waving back now and again. Then I get on the stairs and continue my journey. What I didn't realize was, this was a dating game kind of situation and they were interested in me as a dating partner. And when I waved back, I was signaling OK, I'm interested too. A narrator's voice says and some of them will wait a long time for a response. (302 words)

["Floods, and saving the baby"] I am in a dingy room in a basement of an apartment house. Ellie is there and so is a baby. The baby needs something and I go to get Ellie who is sitting like she is comatose near the kitchen. I see the dishwasher and start to do the dishes. But suddenly, a whoosh of water wells up, and spills out over the floor. I am pushed out the door of the apartment by the force of the water and more is coming. I run to escape the flood. Down a long dark hall I run. I go up to another higher floor and search for people to get help. I see a door open and go into some office with odd looking phones. Two men are working there. I say I need to call for help. They vaguely notice me but don't do anything. I try to use a phone but can't figure out the complex button system. I scream at one man "You son of a bitch." I yell at the back of the other man, get the fuck out of my way. He is shocked and jumps quickly out of my way. I race back down the hall. I must return and save the baby and Ellie. I find a tiny wooden box with metal wires and pipes in it hanging on the wall. This is an elevator. Two other woman accompany me. You have to hang on with your hands on the metal pipe. But three women is too much weight and the small box speeds it's way to the basement. We hit hard, but are all right. I run back down the hall, the water increasing in depth until I get to the apartment. It's up around my thighs at that time. I force my way in and go get the baby, finding Ellie and forcing her awake. (314 words)

["Angry Archie and the Kiss"] Lucy and Archie are seated side by side. At a table. We are indoors but no architectural details. Archie is telling Lucy something that I get angry about. Perhaps he is belittling her. I tell him I don't like the way he is treating her. He is instantly furious with me and rails at me for a long time. I have no business interfering, and so on. I start to walk away, but he comes to me and steps in front of me. He then kisses me very lovingly. I respond to the sweet kiss with pleasure but I am confused about what all this means. (106 words)

["Don't Discriminate."] Charla and I are in front of a building. We are getting ready to walk to school. I can't find a paper where I'd done an outline of my homework. I ask her to help me find it in the piles of paper on the sidewalk. She's not very helpful. I look and finally find it. Now we walk up the front steps and into the house. The Casey family is having a reunion. I go into a room and see them gathered near a table. I am offered a piece of chocolate pie. I ask is there sugar in it? Then I laugh. Of course there is. Who do I think I'm talking to? It is Grandma Casey who sugars everything. I say I have to get Charla off to school and leave. I can't find Charla outside and Rochelle drives up to the building asking me where is the accessible bathroom. I tell her of three different ones on different floors and decide to walk her there. We go in and wander around but end up going out the back of the building and into a bus. I realize I'll be late for school now and get off the bus. We enter another building and have a hard time finding a ramp, which is rickety and crude. We go in and then I come out the other side. This time at the curb I have to jump down over there are a line of cats lying, relaxing. I go around them so as not to hurt them. Now I'm at the school. I enter the classroom and see the students in three circles. They are choosing who goes in what circle. I see Charla there and am relieved. I had wondered if I should return to the original building or go on to the school. I hear a snotty young teen woman say We aren't ever going to choose a granny in a wheelchair. I get righteous and say loudly that is against the ADA discrimination law. You can't do that. They don't care. They don't want anything to do with me. (354 words)

["Worthless package and a round ocean wave"] I am lying on a beach by the ocean at night. Ginny is off swimming or walking. It begins to rain and storm. I look at the ocean and am concerned that the waves are so big. They are oddly curled so that it seems the ocean is coming at me from two angles, perpendicular to each other. Like the wave is coming at me and curves around to be surrounding me. I get up, trying to move my sleeping bag and things into the house. Ginny walks up and helps me. Now I am in a house and sitting on a couch. Ernie comes over and sits beside me. He sits unusually close and I am very aware of that. It feels comfortable and yet there is tension. Now I am packing and I pick up a small pretty box with a price tag of $20.99 on it. I open it to see what is worth $20.99. I see lots of tissue paper and a small address book. I leaf through it and see where you can write birthday dates and so on. I rummage around and don't find much else. I decide this isn't worth much at all. But by now it is a big suitcase. I find a large wad of pantyhose, musty smelling in one of the compartments. (222 words)

["Spoiled miniature woman"] I am in a wheelchair. I hold a baby that is tiny and abandoned. I am comforting it. It doesn't stay well in my arms I keep adjusting it's position because it limply curls up in an awkward way. There are people in the room with me. Now the baby I took care of grew up and is a tiny miniature woman. I have her in a small cave with a window at the top so I can peek in and check how she's doing. To the small woman, it is a window to the sky that occasionally has a giant eye in it. To me it a porthole to her world. She lives alone. One day, Charlton Heston moves in. He brings her a fresh kill from the hunt. She is uppity and wants him to cook it and serve it. He plops the meat down and says. I got it for you. You will have to gut it, prepare it and cook it if you want to eat. She is angry and haughty, refusing to do anything to help. Charlton walks away from her. But a lower window is broken and a cat comes in. She is afraid and runs to hide for her life. A small orange kitten gets in too. Either I reach in and take them out, or Charlton does. The window is fixed, so she will be safe. (234 words)

["Forgot my nightgown"] I am sleeping. It is the middle of the night and I wake up, although I am still groggy. I sit up and notice that a group of family members are sitting around a campfire on the other side of camp talking. I realize I need to get up and join them. I stumble out of my bed and go there, rubbing my sleepy eyes. I am having a hard time keeping them open. Now we are going for a ride in a cousin's car. I get to drive. Michael J. Fox is my friend and sits on my left. He drapes him arm over me in friendly closeness. I am seated like I'm in the backseat, only it is the only seat and the steering wheel is there. I laugh and comment that most of the car is in the front end, but I am surrounded by my loved ones here at the back. I see the fancy set of pedals to operate the car with. It is a golden bronze color. We start to travel. I realize suddenly with a gasp that I had forgotten to pack my nightgown and maybe a few other things I need. (199 words)

["Western Penguins and my father the streaker"] I am at a festival and get a table. I decide to leave my bowl of potato salad and my three forks there as place savers. A woman tries to take my spaces but I explain I am saving them for two other people and myself. She is annoyed, but moves on. So now I am walking down a sidewalk toward the music and fun. I see a fake tavern and go in to watch the silly old west melodramas they put on there. Then I leave and walk on. I am in another structure, now with Charla. We sit. I am in my wheelchair now. We think we are sitting where the entertainment will be seen, but it turns out we are wrong. So we move to a better viewing spot. Lots of people mill around. My father comes up to me. I am delighted to see him and we hug. There is some activity outside and we look. It is a bunch of horses and then people dressed as old west penguins are getting off the horses and coming toward that tavern. I tell my father this is a melodrama. It will be fun to watch. My father gets a gleam in his eye and says playfully, I can still do that (meaning singing), as a group of old time singers are doing a barbershop quartet kind of thing, with their arm outstretched toward the audience. My father suddenly rips off his shirt and runs naked to the waist into the group and gets on bended knee to sing with them but they freeze in shock and go silent. This makes my father very conspicuous. I feel sad for him and embarrassed. I walk over toward the tavern. One of the players sees me and decides to lasso me in a hangman's noose and incorporate me into this drama. I play along. Another player joins us. We do play dialog for awhile and then just chat. I tell him I am an actress. Oh, professional? They ask. I say well, no. I used to write these scripts and.. They interrupt. I see the red head friend of Leighanne who is in commercials go by. I say I know her. As I am leaving the men, I turn and say, by the way, that was my father who joined your show. He just wanted to harmonize and have fun. But you just froze up. Too bad. They stare at me incredulously as I walk away from them. (418 words)

["Lesbian Math"] I am seated on a couch. A man and a woman are on my left. The man is sleeping at the far left. The woman is nodding off. She sits between me and the man. I decide to look at a book a woman wrote about math problems that aren't generally explained. It is a study guide. This one problem is about explaining the line that is drawn through the bottom denominator which denotes the seller. As I open the book, some of the pages tear off like pages off a notepad. I try to put them back together. I think I would be interested in learning this obscure math problem. Now a landlady of the apartments I'm in is seated on my right. She is complaining about how she and her husband have to quit the manager job because they expect them to move book cases and so on. Too hard for them with their disability. She then starts singing a silly song about lesbians. "Look them in the eye, now you have to look them in the O." She laughs. I feel a bit uncomfortable that she is talking about lesbian sex, but shrug my shoulders and enjoy the song as it is cute, the pun on eye and I. Apparently the letter O means orgasm or the vagina opening. (222 words)

["Disabled boy on my lap"] I am in a gym. Some women are at one end. A young boy in a wheelchair is near me. I ask him if he wants to sit in my lap. I am also in a wheelchair. He nods yes. He has Cerebral Palsy. I move my wheelchair close to him and see he is strapped in. I realize I will have to unstrap him and lift him into my lap as he can't do it himself. I am concerned I can't do it, but I try and am successful. He is light. I hold him in the chair and drive around. I stop in front of a mirror. We smile at seeing our reflection. Other children and women come over and stand with us and I have a camera and try to take pictures of us all in the mirror. I keep hitting the button at the wrong time but manage to get some pictures. Now the boy is a man and is seated at a counter across the gym. I drive over to talk and hit the precarious counter and some things tumble over. I apologize and we chat. I guess he likes one of the women at the other end of the gym. I ask him to tell me which one. He hesitates. I then think he is worried as his counselor I will go try to get her to like him. I assure him I will keep the information confidential and will not do anything. I am just curious to see if I guessed right which woman it is. He tells me it is the woman with black pants, dark hair and a T-shirt with writing on it. I go to see and sure enough, I was right. (292 words)

I walk down the street. I am carrying some glass art objects that are blue colored and shaped like fluted clam shells. They are very pretty. I see an art gallery and walk up the stairs to the entrance. I feel adventurous because I know Rochelle wanted to go here later and I don't want to run into her, but I think it will be fun to be here for awhile. I go in. A woman who works there comes up to me and is interested in my art objects. We walk down a wide hall to another partitioned show room. A man is selling cloth cat shaped dolls and hats.

A woman friend and I watch her closely, concerned she will try to kill herself in her distress. She climbs up a large tree with a full canopy, scrambling from branch to branch. I say to my friend that we should get her down from there. I grab her as she passes and pull her out of the tree. She is upset with me. I sit her down and start talking to her. I say, Now listen to me. I am a counselor and have learned a few things also in my own life. You feel that what is happening to you has only ever happened to just you. It is universal. There are three things that can happen when the inevitable happens and two people's eyes meet and they fall in love. One is that the other does not return the love and you will have unrequited love. The second is that they will love you and you do not return their love and they have unrequited love. The third is that you both fall in love and all is well. So you see, it just happens. And you figure out how to live with it. Later, I see Mabel wandering around. She comes into the room I am in not noticing that a large killing monster is around. I grab her and tell her about the danger. She doesn't seem to be concerned, like she is deaf to the reality. I and several other people are preparing to fight off the monster. I have a knife. Another has a rifle. The monster comes in. The real danger is the small entity that lives in the monster. I have to get it out of the monster and kill it before it gets us. Somehow we get the monster laid down on the floor and I use my knife to cut papers shavings to start a fire to burn it. The monster pays no attention to me. I find a lighter and start the fire. One large square eye opens then. I have the monster's attention. I try to stab it with the knife but the blade falls off the handle. I wish now I had the rifle as it is the real weapon that will work against the small entity inside. The monster now laughs at me and I see a larger more scary monster approaching me from the hall. It is the really dangerous one coming after me. I look around for the man with the rifle hoping I can get it. (442 words)

I search through the rack of clothes and can't find the one I'm supposed to wear. A woman comes over and finds the blue velvet dress. I am looking for a tape of music I might want to use, but realize that it would be a waste of time to get it now. The program is already fixed. Now I am in the dress and Bill Domhoff and Bob Van de Castle are there to examine my mind. I will go into a trance of some kind and they will analyze what is in there. They are very interested in this research. After they examined me, I suddenly jump into a swimming pool. In the pool is a small swimming white speckled bird, sort of like a penguin in shape. It is swimming around the edges of the pool. I twirl around, dress and all, and swim with him. Bill watches as I'm still in my trance state. The bird goes underwater and I follow. It is fun and the bird and I watch each other in a friendly way. We playfully swim together. (207 words)

["Outer Space and Quiet love"] I am a part of a team that is flying to another planet to either spy on or help them with a new energy system. The leader is a nice man like Glenn F. We are in a spaceship. We arrive at a planet and go to the university. Several young women are with us as volunteers to the project. They want to go get some lunch. I say there are lots of places to eat, but you have to pay for your own food. This upsets one woman, with dark hair. She thinks the project should pay for their entire way. I say that would be too expensive. I walk with them down a hall to a cafeteria area. Glenn comes up to me and we talk. We are going to find the leader of the planet and get or give information on this dynamic energy system. Then Glenn gently kisses me, almost like a accident. I am a bit surprised., but enjoy it. We chat and he kisses me again. I wonder if he is just being friendly or if he is attracted to me. I hope he is attracted to me because I really like him. Now he sits on a couch. Another man is already seated there. It is a three cushion couch and I go over to sit near Glenn. I ask the other man to scoot over and make room for me. He grumbles and says that would require him to get up and go change clothes. I look at him, waiting. He sighs and gets up. I sit close to Glenn. He kisses me again, this time with more lingering feeling. It is gentle and sweet. Now he is going to walk me home. I am now in my wheelchair and we chat as we walk down the hall. We come to the door of my apartment. He has some studying to do and so he comes in to lay on my couch and study. At the door, I get up out of my wheelchair and walk in. I am trying to show him that I can walk like an able-bodied person and maybe he'll find me more attractive. My daughter Ellie is there and she quickly sees that he and I want to be alone. She excuses herself to the other room. I walk over to the couch and sit next to him. I ask him if he's a fast reader or a slow reader. I am trying to help him study better. I seem to think he has a learning disability and is a bit slow with school work, although he is an intelligent person. He says he has some trouble but not much. Now it's time for him to go. I walk him out the door and down the hall. We pause and say goodbye. I turn and walk back to my apartment door. He calls to me and comes back. He then says will I go see a movie with him on Sunday. I smile, and inwardly I feel very happy and excited. I say yes, I'd like that. He smiles, walks away and I close the door, and hear him shout All Right!! Which is what I am inwardly shouting myself. I am very happy. (547 words)

["Back at work"] I am back at work in the counseling department. Mabel hands me a small cup of water and tells me to take it to Jason for his son. I am walking through the halls looking for the room. I walk a long way and feel very tired. I decide to take a short cut. I go to a wall that has a small broken hole in it. Several disabled people are seated nearby. They are sitting quietly, resigned. I see the hole is too small for me and particularly for my purse. I am very frustrated because this means I will have to walk the long way around. I say out loud, I hate being disabled. I feel bad then because of the other disabled people there. I continue walking. I am now walking down a long hall in the basement floor. I see my co-worker Jerry walking with a bad limp. He hurries past me. Then he comes back and walks with me to help me find my way. I finally arrive at a long table where the counselors are seated in a row. I walk to Jason's place and hand him the cup of water, which is now partly empty because some spilled. Now I look up to the ceiling and see a grate. Through the grate I see a group of the counselors seated in their lounge area. Hank is talking. He is looking down where I am and commenting that he didn't realize that the two rooms could see and hear each other. He is surprised. The counselors used to have this room. And the students were in the above room. (275 words)

["Blue Piano and a woman dying"] I am knitting a sweater. I have the right half of it done and most of the shawl back. I am running out of yarn. I am in a house. Suddenly, my yarn is pulled into another room. I follow it and tell Ernie that I think the woman I am knitting this sweater for is telling me I don't have to finish it. I want to finish it though. I think the woman is dying and I want to do this for her. I go to a corner where I am looking for another yarn skein. I see a bright red one. The sweater is a pale blue. Or gray. I put the right side on and see it fits perfectly, the hem right at the top of my waist. Now I am in another room and a woman in a blue bathrobe is sitting. She is dying. Her mother and her brother sit on her left. They are holding her hand and being supportive and sympathetic and sad. I hold her right hand. Another woman is at my right watching and also sympathetic to the dying woman. Her hand is square and blunt. Her arms thin and angular. I feel very sad she is dying. She strokes my hand. She is seated in front of a tiny blue piano, a very small baby grand piano. I admire it and wonder if maybe she would give it to me when she dies. It would fit in my tiny house pretty well. Then I feel guilty for having such material thoughts when she is dying. How selfish of me. (269 words)

["War and Uncle Gus the Vulture"] I am in a house, maybe Aunt Esther's. It is a resort I am visiting. War broke out and it is time to pack up and leave. I think at first that I will only take essential things but as I look around I see many things I had brought that I don't want to leave behind. Knick knacks, pretty boxes and so on. I begin to gather them up and pack them. I wish I hadn't brought so much stuff. I remember that a young man who is now at war left his quartz crystal in my keeping. I go to the hutch to get it. I see several small ones. I'm not sure which one is his. I take several just in case, also aware that they aren't mine, but I kind of like them. I feel a bit guilty. I put them in a small pink pouch with a drawstring top. I work hard at keeping that pouch close by and not getting packed under lots of things. It is important to deliver it to the man. I realize I don't know where my clothes are an call out for help. I am agitated. A woman, a younger version of my mother comes over and says calm down. She will help me. We walk to the cabin we'd been staying in. By now most people have packed and fled. There are rows of black purses left behind in the rush. I look at them and say none are mine. My mother likes one of them with a lacy pattern and suggests we take it. I say no. It's not ours. I see Boomer and pick him up to take him with us. He struggles and tries to get away. I hold tight. My mother sees a pair of pajamas for a toddler. She takes it because she likes it and puts Fluffy in it to carry her like a baby. We walk back to the house. I go in and see photos laying on a table. I wonder if they were left out for me to take. They are photos of Abner, Darcy and me in a coastal town that I know. I look around and see a cousin, perhaps Dora. I ask her if I am supposed to take these. She hesitates and then says no. I don't think so. I look at each one. I see a series of picture of Darcy posing as a young girl in pretty clothes, black and lacy, which show off her budding womanly figure. I see a photo of Uncle Gus as a young man. He is handsome. Then I see a photo of him older and walking. It is a side view and I notice that his neck is crooked and shaped like a Vulture's neck. I wonder if he is alive. I should talk to him. Now I leave the house. I get into a jeep and drive up a steep mud road. It is hard going and I think that soon it will be flat and paved and I will have an easier time. I look forward to that. But I turn a corner and am in the hall with the wall blocking the road. I am stuck. Then I am in a field. Shooting is going on and I crouch, my back protected by a fallen log. I am scared and hope I don't get hit with bullets. The battle is pretty intense. I get into a deep pond with a moose and the two of us stand there, covered by the water, hiding from the war.

I realize New York City has been totally covered and it is still getting bigger. Now it is clear that the entire world will be covered. I see the land all barren and rocky. No vegetation, nothing. I am aware that only a few people survived this catastrophe. They live in rocky caves. Now I look in front of me and see a huge long phallic looking outcropping of rock which is the core plug from the original site of the eruption. A woman is in a hot air balloon floating above it. She, another woman and a man are descending down the ropes to explore this rock. They precariously go down the ropes looking like they could fall to their death at any moment. The rock is surrounded by a deep open abyss. Now the woman looks past me. I turn and look and see a rooster. I am surprised and glad to see there are animals left. I then see two nanny goats. The woman wonders and hopes there is a male goat as well. I see a quail. There is hope for survival on this decimated planet. (223 words)

["Disfigured face and cheating"] I am at some program the children are putting on. There is a series of different skits. It is finished and I am walking to a table to get some lunch. A woman teacher sits on the right. I see several empty spots and reach for a chair. Gordon is headed for the same chair and there is some confusion. I finally ask him if he is going to be sitting there. I then sit down. The woman is watching me closely. Someone says don't leave your purse on that shelf, lined up with the rest. It's an easy mark and someone will steal it. I put my purse there anyway, as I don't believe there is a danger. Now, Mary Sue and I are standing somewhere and she has a disfigured face with many scars. I am telling her not to be so embarrassed and sensitive about it. People get used to things and they don't bother them after awhile. I tell her that people got used to her blindness, why is this different? She insists that this is different. She remains in hiding. Now I am seated at a table with Mary Sue and Lucy. That same woman is watching us closely. Lucy has to fill out a quiz about the program we saw earlier. She can't remember the sequence of the skits and asks me to fill it out for her. I start to and then become very aware of the woman watching. I realize I am helping Lucy cheat. I stop and say no. I can't do this. This is cheating. Somewhere in this dream, I see a small golden and white kitten seated on a blanket with a pile of clothes. (286 words)

["Aliens and Capt. Picard"] I am in an old run down apartment building. I walk fearfully into my bedroom. There are weird little metallic spiders. Capt. Picard comes in to examine them. He has a detector machine and we hear the things humming a high pitched sound. They gather up in a swarm and come at us. We run. They are aliens and are going to attack us. We get into an elevator. One of the aliens gets in and is plump and white like a small puppy. It tried to sting me. I grasp it and fight it off, throwing it to the floor. One goes for Capt. Picard. We struggle but they win and overcome us. Now we are on their planet, held prisoners. We must escape. I run down old dilapidated halls. They follow. Now one of them looks like a German soldier. He throws me to the ground and lies on top of me to rape me. I push him off and grab him by his toes and drag him down the hall. I see a sign on the wall saying Gender Toes. It means their sexual organs are in their toes. I release him and run to the elevator to escape with the others. I get in, he chases after me, I slam the door. He forces it open. I hit him forcefully. He falls and I escape, just barely. (231 words)

["Love Blooms and I am healing."] I am at a conference with the other counselors from work. Tyler is seated near me. We chat. I am rooming with Phyllis. We are going to cross the street to wade in the ocean. As we start to cross, cars race past nearly hitting us. Phyllis is scared and refuses to try and cross the street again. I look to my right and see two curved streets coming into our street. I step forward out into the street to see more clearly. I see a clearing and run across the street calling to Phyllis to follow. She does. We get to the sand and walk to the ocean edge. I see large chunks of broken ice floating in the water. I am surprised. That will be cold!! We walk along the edge. Then I look again and see that there is a long series of shower curtains pulled closed at the water's edge. We can't see the ocean. Now I return to the conference. Time to do some sort of project. I take a poem of mine to share. I try to etch it on glass. It is not working right. I try to find the room in the basement where this meeting is being held and I am getting lost. I finally find it. Now, I am in a house. It is big with lots of rooms. I have returned from the conference with the counselors. I am unpacking. Cherie is there to help. I see that my bookcase is still gone and a few other things. They aren't put back from unpacking. I walk out to the living room from my bedroom (which has glass French doors). I am glad to be home. Apparently my mother isn't back from work yet. The place is quiet. I like that. I walk into the kitchen. Now I see my mother driving into the house. I wonder how she managed that. I guess she made the front door accessible for the car. She stops at the door to the next room and pushes an automatic door opener button. The door opens and she drives through. I don't remember having that before. Jerome comes in. He is friendly and chatting about the conference we were at. I am surprised but pleased he is so friendly. We laugh about some amusing incidents at the conference. He asks to see my project pictures from the conference. I go to a loft area and jump up there to get the pictures. With great ease, I get back down by holding on to the edge with my hands and easily letting myself down with only a short drop to the floor. I am surprised and happy to see I can do this. I walk, noticing how comfortable it is. I am in the kitchen with Jerome leaning on the counter. I show him the pictures. He touches me in a supporting friendly way, his hand on my arm or shoulder. I enjoy this. He likes the pictures and we continue talking. I see a large dark horse walking through the house. Jerome opens the refrigerator to find ice cream. He hands me a gallon container with multi colored ice cream called "something Mateo." He gets another container out and we eat right out of the containers laughing and talking. I feel very happy. I share with him some stories from the conference, things that happened, like when Phyllis and I tried to cross the street and the cars kept racing by. He is kind and supportive, more frequently standing very close to me and touching me in a friendly way. It is pleasurable. He sits on the floor and I slide down the wall and sit with him, commenting that it feels wonderful to be able to do this again. I tell him that lately I've been feeling better and stronger. I see my reflection in a glass and I see my hands. I rub them together. I say I sure hope this means I'm healing. But I've been here before. We'll see. He smiles at me. Now I see the dark horse again. Jerome and I decide I will ride him. Jerome helps me get on his bare back. We walk to the front door. As the horse is walking down the steps I slide up his neck precariously. Jerome steadies me and tells me to sit back near his back shoulders. I do and it is now comfortable and safe. We walk through a field where I see two tractors with hay mowing attachments racing each other. Jerome hops on the back of the horse behind me. It feels very good to have his arms around me, holding me securely. I am aware that we are sexually attracted to each other. I am also aware he is married. We ride for awhile. Then we get off the horse and kiss. It is sexually exciting. He pulls back, saying. I can't. My wife. I say I know. You have to leave. We kiss one more time. (842 words)

["Beautiful Music Becomes A Chore"] Whoopie Goldberg has wonderful musical talent. She plays a piano piece and impresses this group of people searching for the best piano players. She plays a piece and the judges in the next room behind the observation window count each note for duration and intensity. She is very good. They want her to do more and then more and then more. She sits at the piano in a tiny room and plays piece after piece. Then the people take this and sell it or do something with it to their advantage. The music is beautiful. After a long time, she grows weary of being constantly working and not getting appreciated. The people keep insisting she continue. She rebels and leaves. She finds a tiny apartment and sits in there looking out the window. She sees a cat and a dog, possibly hers. She throws a steak down to the sidewalk for them to eat. Then she decides to take her precious jewelry (three necklaces of black hematite pearls) to throw away into a river. She walks to the river, looking for a place where she can throw the necklaces away. But the sandy bank is long and the water out of throwing distance. A man playing a baseball game in the nearby field sees her. He seems to understand what she wants to do. He walks over to her and leads her to a rail where you can drop things down into a man's booth. If the stone or gem lands in a bowl of similar gems, you get more. He drops a pretty amethyst gem into a bowl and gets some back. She tries it too and succeeds as well. (281 words)

["Landslides"] I am at some performance area, like an outdoor stadium built into the hillside. I am looking for an aisle I can walk up. But each aisle is crowded with people. I finally find one at the end and walk up it. Now at the top I am walking across mountainous terrain. Suddenly, a landslide slide starts under my feet and I scramble hard to move off it without falling. Each time I get to a more secure footing, a new landslide would start. I scramble hard until I reach the edge where it is more secure. (97 words)

["Shaky Ponds And Love"] I am walking with my sister Lydia, my brothers Dwight and Jake. Another man, perhaps a distant cousin, named James is with us. We are looking at many tables and booths where people are selling jewelry and other items. Someone is dragging a long white sheet. I lie down on the sheet, thinking it is funny. Dwight is upset, and says get off the sheet. There are hites on the sheet, and they will hurt you. They will bite you. I laugh, not too worried, but I do get up and walk. We go up and down many levels, looking at all the things on the tables. I decide I want a long beautiful crystal necklace. I turn back and walk to those tables. A short round man follows me. He professes his love to me. I keep walking. I looked to my left. I see a large pond. It is shaking and the water is very active. I say oh, No. Do we have to cross this pond again? As we continue walking, I see that we can walk around it. And now James has decided he loves me. He calls a friend over, to witness his proposal of marriage. He holds his arms out to me, and I walked to him to hug him. We are going to be married. The other man has found another woman and they love each other. (234 words)

["Church In Basement, Machine Guns"] I am in a friend's house. She is very ill. Someone is after her. I am trying to help her. I walk carefully out the front door with a gun. I threaten the people to back off. They are trying to find a special treasure. I see a mud puddle by a door to another part of the house. I feel in the water for the treasure. The water slowly drains away. I see some ceramic figures in the muddy bottom, but not the special treasure. I now see a door to a church in the basement of the house. I am looking down a long distance. A woman from the church looks up at me and I signal her. She nods and goes to another room and returns with the golden treasure. An urn. I nod again and she takes it back to the safe it was kept in. I jump down into the church. The people are after me and I run through the halls. I see church women, friends of my friend, who are happy to see me here again. I peek into a couple of rooms to see other women doing classes and so on. I get to the room next to the safe. A group of people are seated in a circle. I run in. The bad people are shooting and the seated people scatter, running for safety. The room is now an open field next to the large building. One machine gun is up on a high wall and shooting. I see one woman walking into the dangerous area. I notice it is Monica Lewinsky. I wonder if we'll see Bill Clinton next. The machine gun chatter keeps getting stronger and faster. I look again from my hiding place and see a long series of garbage cans stretched out with perhaps 5 or 6 machine guns in a circle at the end. A gatlin gun. It is spewing bullets all over and is now moving toward me. (333 words)

["Marijuana and Radio Interference"] I am in a house. A group of women are here to do some project. I am clearing off the dining table. My baby is sitting quietly in a high chair near me. I take a sponge and wipe off lots of crumbs. I'm a bit embarrassed there is so much of a mess. I am in a hurry, so the women don't notice. The plastic tablecloth is actually two of them with different prints sort of stuck together. It doesn't look good. I am quickly thinking if I have any glue or stuff the women will need for the scrap books they are making. I look over to the baby and she is nearly buried under cloth and stuff from the clean up. I feel bad. I tell Ellie, sitting nearby, to put her to bed. I realize it is 9 pm and she should have been in bed sooner. I feel guilty. Ellie is annoyed I asked her to do this. I glare at her and insist. She leaves with the baby. Now the secretary of state, a woman, enters the room. Some woman is announcing her arrival and how this is related to the use of marijuana as a medicinal plant. I realize they had planted some marijuana in our back yard for this evening's event. We are to get stoned before we do the project. I run out the back door to the garden. I see a man pulling up a marijuana plant by the roots and walking away with it. I see green beans thick on the vines. I go back in to confront the women. I tell them I am upset they would plant marijuana in my parents garden without consulting us. They laugh and say it's not a problem, because the law says you can for medicinal purposes. There's only a small chance of being arrested. I feel silly for making such a fuss, but feel compelled to continue. I half-heartedly explain how upset I am. (333 words)

["Pleasant Ghosts"] I am in a house. Apparently, I bought it. My relatives are helping me move in. Uncle Lionel comes in the back door with some things. I say, put them in the refrigerator. He goes to a side room I have not explored yet. I say, no, not that room. The kitchen. I then go into the room to see what's in there. There is a second room beyond that one. I look around, pleasantly surprised to see old beautiful curio cabinets, with dark woods and curved glass. Two of the smaller cabinets are crooked. I see a small window that looks into my bedroom. Near it is a picture of some old man, maybe the old gentleman who used to own this house. He is long dead. As I look at the picture, it becomes animated. He smiles at me. We talk. I go into yet another room between my bedroom, where I can see my unmade bed, and the room with the picture. Lots of interesting things are in there. I see this room opens into yet another series of rooms. I start to walk toward the door but hear someone peeing and realize the old man is using the toilet there. I turn and walk back into the curio room. I see another picture where a series of faces appear. Ugly old fat men, one of whom has an open ulcerated sore on his face. These are the old friends of the old man. They are chatting about how when his wife died, he was.. At that point, the old man comes in and they shut up. We all pretend we weren't talking about him.

["Grade A Papers"] I am attending a conference. A large crowd is in a large room. As I come in, the star of the entertainment Buddy C., a comedian, takes my purse. Someone else takes my wallet to put somewhere for safe keeping. This seems quite normal. I feel fine about it. I sit on the ground. I look high up at a balcony where we are watching a news reporter and Buddy C. doing a comedy routine of funny faces and pauses. I am surprised old sober sides the reporter can be funny. He hams it up. Now it is time to leave. I ask a man, like Charles of the conference in California, if I may borrow his car. He happily agrees. I walk around a graveled hill to the gas station parking lot. I get into his fancy black car and drive. I am conscious of being very careful so I don't hurt the car. I feel responsible. I return to the same spot and get out of the car. I clean up my piles of papers from the conference. I see several of my reports I wrote at the conference. One has a big red "A" on it. I say to a woman friend Last year I didn't even turn in a report. The year before that I got a boring "b" minus. I am very proud of my important "A" grade. I pick up many small scraps of paper I had made cutouts with. I want to return the car in good condition. (255 words)

["Buddy Guy And I"] I am in an auditorium. There is a music concert of blues there. The seats are like theatre seats, raked up. I am seated up toward the top. I am looking down at the performance area, watching the two black men playing their guitars and singing the blues. They are good. One comes up the aisle still playing his guitar. It is Buddy Guy. He sees me and smiles. He nods at me, inviting me to walk with him and dance. We slide down the row of theatre seats in a gliding dancing motion. It is great fun. We are in rhythm and enjoying this together. We dance back up the aisle. Now we are close together, attracted and feeling warm and loving. I tell him he is being discounted and not used up to his potential by these other people who are more interested in their own egos. He sees it my way and we decide to break off from the music group he was with and go out on our own. (173 words)

["God Chooses Me"] I am in a huge mansion on the edge of a high cliff that drops straight down to the ocean. I feel a small shake of an earthquake. For awhile, there are only occasional small shakes, but it builds up to a nasty earthquake. I look out the window worried the house will fall off the cliff and smash into the ocean. I hear a huge crash and see that a big wave came up and broke the window on the other wall. I decide it is time to pack and leave. I think about what I should pack. What is most essential. I get my pills. Then I remember my writing and pack some of that. I find some clothes on the floor and my toothbrush. I am fairly calm and moving slowly even though the earthquake continues. Now I look up at the ceiling in time to see a tidal wave entirely engulf the house. Now I am scared and hurry. Howard comes in. We say hi and I continue rushing to pack. He leaves. Suddenly I look out the window on the ocean side again and see a tall dark figure floating toward me. It has black plastic armor on and a long black lance. The pointed end of it is coming straight at me. I realize this is God and he is choosing me for something. Now I realize I have been chosen to coordinate the writers. I gather up the empty writing books to give to the writers as they arrive. They slowly trickle in. I give each one their book. I pick up a letter Howard sent me. It begins with the word "Honey." He describes the new building he moved into. Brick with marking of circles and squares on each window. An old high school friend comes in. I find his old high school writing book and give it to him. I say he can choose to finish the stuff he started, or write new stuff. We chat about the days when we were in a writing group together. He said collaboration with me was really good. The other group member, Mary was OK, but not like we were together as a writing team. (371 words)

["Ladies Social Group"] I am sitting in the first row of chairs at a women's group meeting. The woman on my left is dishing out pot roast dinner. I see she hands it to the row behind us. I point out I didn't get any. She says the other woman asked first. I wait, hoping as it passes by, I can get some. Then I am distracted by some project we are doing, involving wrapping a yarn around a stick and covering it loop by loop. I am wrapping the stick and listening to the woman speaker at the front of the room. I manage to make a mess. Then I notice I'm not doing it right. I had started it one way and now I'm doing it another way. I lay it down on the floor. The meeting is over and I get up to go. I leave the stuff on the floor and see the other woman cleaning up after me. I feel bad, but I don't do anything about it. (170 words)

["Heart Attack"] I live in a large building downtown. I go outside and talk to two women who are going to do some work for me, but I haven't been doing the work I need to do, before they can do their work. I tell them I'll get right to it. I don't really want to, but I feel obligated to say that. They are both sitting in rocking chairs. They know I don't really mean what I said.

["Seth And The Kitten"] I am walking through a long old building that is a series of rooms like in a museum. Each room has a special book collection from different countries and from ancient ages. I enter the Tibetan Book Of The Dead room and am very excited to see this exhibit. I see a Japanese room and look at the book covers which look like an old dream journal book of mine. I also see some books with a purple swirl pattern. I am now in a large room with some other women. A man comes to the door, from the prince. I am invited somewhere. I can't find my kitten and am sad. I am called outside where I see some kittens, including the cute fuzzy gray one that is mine. I am told to call to it. Someone is calling "Here Kitty, here kitty." I say to the cat, "Pasele" I explain it is important to just let the kitty come as it wishes, giving it encouragement, not demands. It comes to me and I pick it up, cuddling it happily. Now I am in another room with Seth, Mary Ann and Katrina and several other women. Seth is very antsy and keeps hitting my chair and annoying me. He bumps me so hard I hit my knee on a corner, hurting myself. I automatically turn around and slap him on his head. Then I hold his head, rubbing the hurt place and trying to explain to him how much he hurt me. Mary Ann is very upset with me. I feel ashamed and guilty. I wish I hadn't lashed out so automatically.

["Walking and Losing The Crowd"] I decide I will walk on a long hike with a group of people. My Aunt Naomi, Aunt Charlotte and Bonnie are also on this hike. It seems to be all women. My Aunt Charlotte saves a place for me near the front of the line. We begin the hike. I walk around and come back to the line and can't find Aunt Charlotte. I ask Aunt Naomi where she is. She says Aunt Charlotte decided not to come on the hike. I am a bit upset, as it was she who promised to save me a space up front. I feel badly about cutting in line. I realize I need to go pee. I leave the line in search of a bathroom. I find one. The door opening is odd. The toilet is directly in the doorway, facing into the little bathroom. In order to shut the door, I pull a small segment of the door over the toilet and then shut a second segment of the door with straps on it. I think about just leaving it open, but decide to go to the extra work of closing it. I then pee. A woman from the group comes in and angrily tells me I wasn't supposed to leave the group. I'm in trouble now. I now go back to join the group. They are gone and I don't know which way they went. I feel nervous about finding them. I feel upset that I am walking for such long distances. I don't know if I'll make it. I feel tired already. The hike seems too long for me to manage. I see a woman and ask her where the group went. She says they went to the Shanghai District of the city. I am surprised because that is such a short distance away. I realize they are taking it easy the first day to help us build up endurance and strength to make it the whole journey. (329 words)

["Flying Dolphins Cathedral Grapes"] I am in a house. I think my brother Dwight lives there also. I notice it is raining very hard. I walk over to a window to see the downpour when I am suddenly aware of the courtyard and how beautiful it is. A canopy of grape vines like a cathedral ceiling. I look to see if there are grapes. Big nice ones, some so big they look like electric light bulbs. What abundance I had with me and I never noticed before. Then I look higher to see two transparent glass like dolphins leaping and arching over the top of this grape vine structure. They are so graceful and beautiful. I go back into the house. A woman stands right in front of me and opens her dress completely like it was a robe. I stare at her naked fat body and then turn my eyes away. I am repulsed by her fatness. She is grinning at me. Then she has underwear on. She closes her dress and is inspecting all the things in the house. Some General is around and wants to know. I show her Dwight's room. I am uppity and joke around about being a spy. I don't like their attitudes. Now a young man is talking to Dwight who is soaking in a pool. He explains he deliberately let the demons out to hunt Dwight and he's really sorry. Dwight smiles, not concerned. (238 words)

["Falling over Ellie"] I am in a house. I am expecting three women to visit. And later, the Judge will be here and I need to teach him something. The women arrive, but the one I need there isn't there. So I leave them in the living room and I begin to clean up the other rooms. I pick up some toys a child left on the floor. And so on, trying to clear the entry way so the women can leave without seeing a mess. Now the meeting is over and the women come out one at a time and I guide them out. I ask the last woman what was decided in the meeting. She paused and couldn't remember very well. She finally said we didn't decide anything we just talked. I felt a bit embarrassed thinking I should have stayed with them as a hostess, and not be off cleaning. The woman comments on the spots of pink on the ceiling which I was trying to clean off. She says how clever to have spots of color in the recessed areas. I say sure, It's called Bas Relief. I am pretending to be very artsy about it, to cover up my shame about being messy. I then point out the bare wall in the other room and say soon I will have cabinets and bookcases there. It will look very nice. I stumble over a laundry basket of clothes and fall into it. The woman leaves, not too impressed. Now Ellie comes in, and I am picking things up. She tries to help and we both reach for a large stuffed animal.

My father, who looks like a young Uncle Joel is going to teach the Judge how to row in a rowing boat, professionally. I am there and as he explains I try to show the right way. I pull back on two rowing arms. I see the lake. The waves are high. Someone says we'd better not practice today, the lake is too dangerous. We all agree. (379 words)

We are in the main church area and I ask a woman if the candy has been passed out yet to the congregation. She says yes. I ask, what about the taffy? She says yes to that also. Now I am a bit worried because that took up some time and I wonder if I'll have enough presentation for the time allotted. I hear the woman announcer say the name of this play is "Women And Cancer." I am surprised because the play is about pioneer women and raising their children. We begin the play. I open a large diaper bag that is very colorful and empty. I try to stand it up but it keeps falling over. I keep readjusting it. I do a monologue about pioneer women and children. It seems a long speech. (154 words)

The nice pastor of the church comes over to where I sit in my wheelchair. He asks me what I think. I say It's wonderful. The men now understand that if they don't change, we, the women, won't want them. And they are changing now. I have hope for the first time in years that I will find relationship. I am smiling, feeling excited. I watch as the church organist is playing a hymn. The pastor is trying to get her attention to ask her to get something from the office. The halo flys to hover over her head. Someone picks it up and moves it to a spot over another person's head. It zips back as if a magnent. This happens three or four times. I stand up and say to the wondering congregation, I notice that while we are arguing over whether this is religious or scientific (secular) it keeps coming back and forth to each one. It appears over a seated man's head in the back of the congregation and the man disappears. A beautiful angel appears on the back wall of the church. I ask it to take me and suddenly I am flying through the air being pulled by some strong magnetic like force. I am trying to speak to the congregation about my experience as I am being drawn to the angel. I say I am scared and yet excited. I am sucked to the angel image and meld with it. My arms are stretched out llike the angel's wings. I am being blended and disappearing into the angel. (292 words)

["Fire!!"] I am with a group of people who somehow time travel and drop into a battle. At the moment we drop in, we are making shooting noises. At that same moment the real soldiers are shooting. So we are not noticed. Now, I am watching as a general (sort of Sean Connery) is sleeping in his tent. The enemy sneak up and light small fires in the corners of the tent. The fires smolder. The general doesn't notice. A woman and a man come to the tent and see the fires. They want to warn the general so he can escape with his life. But instead, the woman, in an attempt to help the General, pour gasoline on the fires to get them to flame up big. Her thinking is to make the situation so bad that the General will notice the danger and escape. He does escape. (148 words)

["Sex In A Closet"] I am in my wheelchair. It is after dinner and Paulina's "husband" nods to her, indicating he's ready to have sex. He and Paulina and I go into a closet like room. I am supposed to be there while they have sex. I busy myself looking at things in a cluttered box of junk. I see a glimpse of his briefs as I try not to observe. He is standing up as she is spread eagle on the table. I feel very uncomfortable and remind myself to ask Paulina if it's all right if I don't attend these after dinner quickies. I see syringe needles from Fluffy's shots, some Xmas cards, one from a cousin, perhaps Darcy, Deirdre or Beverly to Charla. Charla never responds to her. I am throwing away the old cards. I decide to dump the whole box, but I see 3 necklaces. Jade marbles with dragon claws on them. I decide to keep them. Jake asks if I should ask Rigo to help me with my dream software since Ricardo isn't being helpful. I laugh and say with strong sarcasm, Goodness No. Rigo is an idiot with computers and will really mess it up. Now Paulina's "husband" is done. I'm surprised it's so quick. Paulina sure didn't get any pleasure. He's dressed again, wearing a black pants, black vest and pink shirt with a ruffle on it. He sighs contentedly like he's had a good meal and pats his tummy (244 words)

A man, balding, with long scraggly hair. He's overweight and not good looking. He wants to date me. I turn him down, packing to go home, feeling betrayed. I can't understand how "Derek" could have betrayed me. I look out a wall of windows and see him coming toward me. He hesitates, looking at me questioningly. I hesitate and then smile at him. He then comes in and I kiss him on the cheek. We talk. Then as we talk I realize this is not ok and I walk back across the wooden platform to the school. He comes with me. I tell him I don't really want this job. I am a valley girl. I don't like M City. Too isolating. No one here I'd want to have a relationship with. Then I tell him I didn't like what he did to me and I'm taking the job. He pulls out a large pistol (silver) and we struggle over it. Sometimes he's trying to kill me. Sometimes he's trying to kill himself. I get the gun from him. The other man that is attracted to me is here as well, watching me, wanting to be with me. (303 words)

["Servant And Love"] I am a servant in a rich home in the 19th century. My job is to take care of the young girl, who is like Charla. The girl is very difficult to manage.

I try to pull back my head to prevent her from hurting me. I carry her into the house. Then I come back outside alone for a few minutes of rest in this difficult day. I need to go back into the house and can't remember which door is the correct one, there so many along the side of the house. I find it and go in.

I go out to greet him. He is a stranger to me, but we are attracted to each other. I am showing him the house. The other servants sneer at me and make belittling comments to me as we pass them. The man continues to be attracted to me. We are standing in the center of a large round table with the middle open. Suddenly he is lying on top of me and it is sexually exciting. I feel his hard penis against my vagina through all the clothes. I like it. But I make him stop because I am afraid people will see us. (282 words)

This is fun and yet I don't want to drown by being knocked over by big waves. We are laughing and talking. He hugs me and pulls me closer to him. It is a very pleasant sensuous feeling. I think it is very intimate. Our full bodies are touching and I love the good feeling. We want to make love. We are in love. It is a very happy feeling.

I am trying to turn it on. There are two small bulbs, one white, the other yellow. An elder man of the tribe gives me a small handmade book. I open it. It is handwritten. It is bound in beautiful buckskin. He made it himself. I am touched and impressed he wrote an important story for me by hand. Now the bath is over and I am dressed, in another room. A young native american woman is talking about how she loves chinese things. I see she is wearing black and red clothes with chinese designs.

["Small Room In Space"] I enter a space ship which looks like a small square room with a door to a small bathroom. The walls are all white. Little or no furniture or decorations. Several other people and myself are seated, waiting for lift off. Then, we get up and go into the actual command part of the ship. It is cold, with fog drifting around and a bit scary. We go to our stations and drive the ship off into space. We are there for a long time. I see a piece of wooden cabinet and I burst into tears, touching it because it's been so long since I have been around normal things and not just metal and space. We travel on. Now there is a huge alien space ship above us and our small ship is caught in the turbulent currents. We are tossed around violently. The aliens come on board. They had been to earth and either transformed earthlings into them or became like earthlings. They look us over and decide we aren't much of a threat. They leave. I remember seeing swirling purple colors when the huge ship was above us. (192 words)

So I act as a distraction to get the mommy busy elsewhere. Charla captures the baby. I carry it on my left shoulder. It doesn't fight, rather it cuddles up in my neck and enjoys the comfort of being close. We see several display cases with bird cages and bird food in them. I check prices and am surprised and not unhappy about how much things cost. I check another case. A metal bird cage costs 51 dollars. That's the cheapest one. I return to the first case where I originally had thought it was too expensive glad to see it costs less than the second case of things. We get a package with cage and food. (180 words)

["Three Brides For Election"] I am in a milling crowd of politicians up for election. I am one of them and am wearing a baize lacy tablecloth folded into a wrap around skirt. I look around to see that two other women candidates also have the same lacy tablecloths. One has two. One for the top and another for the skirt. Yet another woman has three of them. We look like brides, with a Spanish mantilla look. I am now the one with three tablecloths on. I pull off the one at the bottom of the skirt that is like a train. I modify the skirt as there is a gap showing. I reset the hooks closer so the gap is closed. It feels ridiculous to have us all looking the same. (128 words)

Suddenly I realize that I can't see or hear the play from this corner because we are several blocks away from the presentation. I get up and walk rapidly toward the outdoor theatre. The other authors follow me. I am nearly running when I wonder if I can manage this. I am out of breath. I finally arrive only to see the play is finished. I hear the applause which sounds warm and loud. I ask a man seated on my right if it is only intermission, or is it the end. He said it was the end. I am disappointed. I ask him what he thought of the play. He said there were too many characters. 14 of them. He couldn't keep track of them all and the plot was too involved and he got confused. I don't feel good about his negative critique. I must be a poor writer. (184 words)

But Ginny is taking so long. I finally do go outside. I hear Ginny coming to the garage door saying "Set A, Set B, Set C" She is counting the keys in key sets to make sure they are all there. It isn't a task that will help me pack. It is simply one task she got diverted to and is lost in trying to get it accomplished. (137 words)

People rush to her to check out if she is OK. They hand her up to my level to show me she is all right. She is curled up, still unconscious. Then there is a deli counter between us. A woman says sarcastically that I will give up and not stay to watch her, because of the deli counter in the way. I am angry at her. As I try to go to the right side of the counter, I discover that the counter goes along the entire edge of the railing. I can't get to Charla to confirm she is all right. (231 words)

Rich comes toward him, angrily telling him to back off. He's not the boss. I am lying on the ground between them. I say this isn't the best place to be. I stand up and walk to a clear area.

Now some woman hits a great fly ball out of the park. Jerome is talking with Tyler about how good the hit was. I join them trying to enter into the conversation. They ignore me.

Jerome says. I agree and start to walk away from the tidal wave. Jerome suggests getting into the van. It at least would float. I think about doing that, then continue walking away. I come to a fence with barbed wire on top of it. Josh runs past me and leaps over the fence. I realize I will have trouble getting over this fence.

["Bear Cubs And Sleeping Beauty"] I am in an old room with very high ceilings. A very tall thickly built man is there. I am looking around, because this is his house and I am curious about how he lives. It is run down, and junky, yet the room itself has elegance with the extremely tall ceilings. I see piles of old things and then I see a litter of bear cubs. Maybe 11 or 13 of them. They are cute and frisky. I pick one or two of them up and hold them. One has a very long thin snout, more like an anteater than a bear. The Mother bear is near by, watching comfortably. The man likes me. He is from some unsavory family. I like him too. He seems gentle. He stands up and I stand near him. I am amazed how much taller he is than me. I am aware of how his muscles are not in good shape. He is sort of pudgy, yet still good looking. He feels warm and cuddly, like a bear might feel, if you could trust the bear. I do trust the man. He lays me on a stretcher and I close my eyes pretending to be asleep. He carries me to other rooms in his house. His male relatives are suspicious of me. but the man and I just like each other. (228 words)

One, Mark, is from a dysfunctional home and is acting out all the time. He is smart, but failing. Merle is from a rich family and is always doing the right things academically. Merle is always on Mark's case pushing him verbally. Mark then responds angrily and gets himself in trouble. Merle is verbally attacking Mark and I walk up to Merle's desk amd lean in on him until he is in a corner. I look him straight in the eye and insist he listen to me. I tell him to leave Mark alone. I tell him he is jealous of Mark because he is so smart. They could be friends, if they'd let go of the animosity. I turn my attention to other children in the classroom. I am an excellent teacher. A man walks into the classroom wanting information about traveling. I help him find maps, even though I feel frustrated at being distracted from my classroom duties. I point out a city he is interested in visiting. I'm not sure if it is Hawaii or Mexico we are talking about. I show him where more maps are. He appreciates my help. I return to the classroom. Mark is standing up showing off to the class. He is smoking a white pipe. I wordlessly hold out my hand. He gives me the pipe and the matches and a wad of money, $5 and $1. His payment for goofing off. I put the pipe in the ashtray. I lecture him. He listens. We both know he'll continue goofing off when I'm not looking. (294 words)

["Tiger Man"] I am watching as someone lays a band across the throat of a man who is lying on a table. We are in some room. The man transforms into a tiger. Then he returns to his original form. This is scary. It means this man is potentially very dangerous, when he is a tiger. I watch as someone lays the band on his throat again. I see the dark bruise mark from the first time. The man starts to resist, then just gives up and lies back, accepting the restriction. Somehow this all means that Charla is dangerous. I use this as an excuse to insist she return to her mother. I want her to go right away, not even finishing the night at my house. I know somehow that I am giving up too easily and it isn't really necessary to do. Turns out that Lydia is her mother. They aren't home when I call. The baby-sitter doesn't seem to be helpful. She doesn't understand what I'm saying and won't take the message for Lydia. I realize that Charla will be fine and I don't need to rush this. (190 words)

["Holding Hands with Howard"] I go from house to house taking peoples bananas and walking around eating them. I wonder why I'm doing this, since someone could see me and get upset. This is stealing after all. But I do it anyway. Now, I am outdoors. Someone is going to show me an old swim pool and a creek. I walk over to the old swim pool, which is all filled with dirt and grass. All we really can see is the outline of where it used to be. From it, a creek flows. I walk over and look into the water. It is clear. Someone points out how the creek bed looks so natural. I say no it doesn't. It looks like it is formally set that way. Everything is too orderly. And there isn't anything in the water. Just then I see small round sea creatures and snails pop up from under the mud bottom. They spin there legs and move quickly around stirring up the silt. Someone asks me to take a scenic walk. We stroll down a path which is gravel. Howard is there now. We walk side by side. Chatting. I feel warm feelings of affection, but I am hesitant, slightly fearful it will turn sexual. We walk the pretty wooded path and talk. We hold hands. On the way back, we are in the backseat of a car. I rest my head on his shoulder, still worried he will become sexual. He remains affectionate and warm. He talks to me as I pretend to sleep on his shoulder. Relaxing but alert. (263 words)

I am walking down a church hallway looking for the room where several of us are going to have a church service, even though we are all different religions. I can't find the room, then I find it. But just then, I am aware of an odd snoring sound I make when I am breathing, that comes and goes. I decide I will go to the bathroom. I return down the hall, now being followed by Glenn Ford. He is attracted to me and we talk together. I explain I am having difficulties with this odd noise in my breathing. He says he has the same problem. Now I am in the bathroom and I sit on the toilet only to see Glenn Ford seated on a small couch. I am embarrassed and say I didn't know you were in the room. He says I'm sorry. But it's OK. We chat. Now I get up and I want to finish dressing. I ask him to leave for a moment. He steps out into the hall. Then I realize he has his shirt stuffed into the top of a dress I had been wearing, all balled up in his arms. I open the door and ask him to come back in with the dress. Then we stand close together trying to separate his shirt out of my dress. It is warm and friendly and fun. I like him very much. I realize I need to go to the bathroom again. I am glad we have decided to go to the same hospital together to figure out what is wrong with us. I try to blow my nose to clear the nose but that only makes it hard to breath. We leave, intending to be in the same hospital ward together. We are scared about the odd physical problem and happy to be together. I am walking down a church hallway looking for the room where several of us are going to have a church service, even though we are all different religions. I can't find the room, then I find it. But just then, I am aware of an odd snoring sound I make when I am breathing, that comes and goes. I decide I will go to the bathroom. I return down the hall, now being followed by Glenn Ford. He is attracted to me and wee talk together. I explain I am having difficulties with this odd noise in my breathing. He says he has the same problem. Now I am in the bathroom and I sit on the toilet only to see Glenn Ford seated on a small couch. I am embarrassed and say I didn't know you were in the room. He says I'm sorry. But it's OK. We chat. Now I get up and I want to finish dressing. I ask him to leave for a moment. He steps out into the hall. Then I realize he has his shirt stuffed into the top of a dress I had been wearing, all balled up in his arms. I open the door and ask him to come back in with the dress. Then we stand close together trying to separate his shirt out of my dress. It is warm and friendly and fun. I like him very much. I realize I need to go to the bathroom again. I am glad we have decided to go to the same hospital together to figure out what is wrong with us. I try to blow my nose to clear the nose but that only makes it hard to breath. We leave, intending to be in the same hospital ward together. We are scared about the odd physical problem and happy to be together. (624 words)

I am a young woman in the 19th century. I live in a mansion. I've been there all my life but alone and isolated, playing piano. Now one night I am playing some classical music on the piano. A distant "mother" is around somewhere. Daniel Day Lewis enters the room. He sees me and is enthralled with me and the music. He is romantic and beautiful. Lovely eyes that watch me with love. The mother doesn't want us to get together. I leave the room and go to a small lawn area outside, where my real family is. We are poorer. He follows me out. He lies down on the grass and says to me you must come back into the house with me. I love you and can't be separated from you for a moment. I am touched and I love him too. I go with him into the mansion. (151 words)

I walk into a store. I like it and decide to buy it. There are art and craft items. A man named Tom comes in and he wants to set up shop with adaptive devices for the disabled. He and his friends are very enthused. The old owner leaves and I am trying to figure out where things are and just what I have for sale. Lots of people seem to be wandering in and out. I am not selling anything. So I begin to look around to see what I now own. I see a Carl's Jr. booth being built. I see a double bed near a fireplace. Apparently I will live in the store as well. I see drawers and open them. I find art work and crafts. They re quite beautiful. I show them to my mother who is envious of the fine work. A salesman comes in to sell me some fix it tools. I decide not to buy anything yet until I know what I have and what is selling. A woman comes in to interview me as the new owner. I tell her I am surprised to be here, since I only arrived in this coastal town at 7:15 am and a half hour later I bought this shop. I am a bit surprised at myself for the impulsive choice. She asks me how I am being treated, being a woman manager. I say some of the men are surprised and condescending, but it's too early to tell yet. Now I go to the register counter area and there are children and people sitting there. I ask them to leave as this is my work area. The children tell me they are waiting for their parents who are helping me with the store. So I say OK, you can stay. Now a sweet baby girl is there wearing a cute pink outfit. She is cuddly and plump. I pick her up and tickle her, doing raspberry sounds on her tummy. She laughs and we are having a good time. Now I notice there are more rooms in the back and I go explore. I find a bird shop where I apparently own cocktails, some rare peach colored ones that are very expensive. I see baby birds also. A petting zoo. I go into the next room. It has two single beds, a shower and things accessible for the disabled. I think this will be a good place to live, so I can save the $340 a month for rent in the new apartment I got. Apparently my mother and I own the store. I own half of it and she owns one quarter. But I think she is going home soon. I find yet another room with lovely wooden bookshelves on one wall. I look out the window and the back area is a muddy mess and ugly. I close the shades. I enter the next room and realize I've entered the next shop. The owner, a man, comes to me and introduces himself, saying He is sorry he didn't greet me sooner. He did indeed notice my arrival but was waiting. We greet one another. (532 words)

I am in a large auditorium, sitting in the first few rows. Two or three lesbian women come around me, teasing me. They are challenging me to kiss and hug them. I smile and say this is not a problem. I feel comfortable, knowing I am not a lesbian. One woman kisses me. It is friendly. I laugh. They give up and go away. Now the people around me are part of a performing troupe I belong to. Kevin Kline is there and I don't like him. He is teasing me too. I am annoyed with him. He gives me a glass of champagne and I accept the challenge and drink it. I become giggly drunk pretty fast. Kevin takes advantage of this and playfully gathers me up in his arms and kisses me. I happily put my arms around him, giggling. We kiss, enjoying each other. An older man, like Capt. Picard, is the leader of our acting group. He wants us to the group to perform. Kevin gets up and walks across a long expanse of lawn. I watch him go, and then want to find him. I get up and run toward him. He jumps out from a small hill where he had been hiding. He and I suddenly make love. He enters me and I feel both of us have orgasm. A small group of people are standing near by, watching us. We don't care. Now the acting group is getting ready to do one more performance for a women's group. The small audience is coming into the auditorium. The actors are up on stage getting ready. I decide I will not join them this performance. I had not brought my script and I don't think I can remember the lines. I sit in the audience, watching. A blind woman, one of the actors is doing her act when she suddenly comes up to the edge of the stage and looks like she will fall over the edge. I know it's a part of her act and laugh when the audience rush up to save her. They realize the joke and gather up at the edge of the stage with great interest to watch more closely. Derek is there in the group as well. I regret now not being a part of the group. But now a woman has a strange boat that looks like a log hooked onto another log. I sit on the side log and she drives the other log as we race across the water, narrowly missing a tree. She is a good driver and we race back and forth having fun. Now it is fine with me I am not performing with the group. The woman makes a mistake and I am dumped into the water. I swim around. This is not a problem. (473 words)

I see a house that is for rent. It looks familiar to me like I might have looked at it before. I walk up to the front and peek in an open door to a made over garage that might be a large bathroom. I realize I have looked at this house before and liked it. I walk in the front door to see a group of men, who are showing the house. A man in a dolly for a wheelchair is looking at the house also. There is no furniture. The living room is large. I like it. I walk through the living room to a wide spacious hall with large windows on the left ad several doors off to the right. I walk down the hall into a bedroom, which has a double bed in it and a rectangle wooden box like cradle with a baby in it. An old man is there making the bed. I am quite excited. This is the house. I must have. And even the baby is there as I anticipated. He looks old and tired. Howard enters the room. I tell him this is the house I want. He says great We'll take it. I ask the man how much the rent is. He says $1500 a month. I wince, that is too much! Howard in his eagerness to have us back together is on bended knee if front of me wearing white pants and shirt. He says It's OK. I'll work it out somehow. I am unsure and concerned by I ignore those feelings because I want the house so much. I agree and we follow the man out to his office to close the deal. Howard goes first, the man and I follow as we walk up an outside stairway upstairs. The walking is difficult, because the steps are loose and wobble under my feet. I struggle to climb the stairs. The man says and there is $1300 a month for the conserve, which I understood to mean the insurance. Now it is clearly too much for us to pay. I hesitate. (352 words)

I am in a room, trying to quickly pack my most essential belongings. The Nazis are coming to take me away and I must try and trick them so I will still have what I need. I am most concerned I have my cortisone pills. I try to gather them up off the bed. And hide them in two small purses. I figure if there are two purses they might find one and I'd still have the other one. There are large books, like dictionaries and reference books I decide to pile them onto the other books and papers in the bookshelf, hoping that the people who own the house will keep them there for me in case I survive and return. A woman comes in and she sees what I did. She understands. She is warning me the Nazi's are here. She is scared for me and I am scared also. (152 words)

I am at some women's conference. In between sessions. I see Roseanne Barr on a stage. She is naked with an elaborate tattoo on her fat butt. Another woman is naked as well. They are laughing and talking about some topic. Roseanne sits down on a chair with her back to the audience to better show off her tattoo. She is enjoying this. She teases the audience by putting her hand back to cover her anus, like she's shy. Later I am walking around, looking for Charlotte Mesquita. I am walking right next to the naked Roseanne. Her breasts are very small. She is chuckling about her flat fat tummy. Now I go into the restroom to pee. Lots of women are in the stall, which is large with me. They are combing their hair and chatting. I wipe myself. Lots of shit, and it is messy. A woman wants to use the toilet and I hurry. A piece of shit falls on the floor and the woman kindly picks it up and puts it in the wastebasket for me. I feel embarrassed she had to do that. I get up and go out, still looking for Bonnie. I walk to a bench on the path with a pile of clothes and so on. I brush my hair which is in a short wedge cut with some of my long hair still in the back. I see Sonja leading a group of blind women in a line. I see Abner in another group. I call to Sonja that I will join her soon. I have a ten dollar bill tucked into my skirt waist to give to Bonnie when I find her. I go to a cabin where a mirror hangs on the outside to see if my hair looks OK. A woman is just inside the open door, sweeping. I can't really see myself in the mirror. I am wearing a long flowing colorful skirt. (326 words)

I am sleeping all night on a closed toilet. It is very uncomfortable. I wake up and I see Gus standing in a far corner of the room, watching. Marci is asleep on a day bed. She is having a nightmare. She tosses and turns, saying "Ouch," "Don't" She is obviously fending off someone in her dreams. Then she suddenly does a sort of somersault over the end rail of the bed and lands on her face on the floor. It must have hurt, but she doesn't wake up. I am worried about her and also aware this might be proof she was incested. I decide to write down what I saw. I get up. It's time to pack and leave. I walk downstairs. I see Aunt Rosalie in a room. I hesitate and then decide to ask her if she knows Ethan who I now think was the man I saw upstairs. I ask her and she becomes agitated and withdraws, saying no, she doesn't know him and for me to stop bothering her. I follow her out the room saying, Please tell me. I need to know. She doesn't answer. It's time for me to catch the train. (200 words)

But they stay close by and try to set up their things very close by. I tell them again to move. Suddenly the young women return all upset and agitated about all the hostility around us.

I open my arms up in a grand gesture and walk around accepting the applause. And now the party becomes a daily celebration and it's sort of a church. I am the leader. A young man sits next to me at the table thrilled to be near me. Now I go to the big room to supervise the activities of the congregation. Some people are bringing in used objects from their homes to be given to others so they can be reused and useful. I am pointing out where to put the various projects. All of them are for helping other people. Later I am one of the citizens who come in to the police station to throw rocks at the helmeted heads of the criminals. A criminal is brought into a cage area and he pokes his head out of a hole. The helmet is to protect him from head injury. The purpose of this activity is to determine if he is guilty or not. If I hit him, he is guilty. I happen to be a talented thrower. A police officer watches and is very impressed with my skill. He admires me and is falling in love with me. I am happily married to Nate with several babies to raise and love my life. I now need to go to my baseball game. He comes with me. I drive down a long lane with grass expanses on the side of it. The game is at the University. I turn a corner and notice a drop off into a pond. I mention to him that my volunteers will fix that.. I make a note to remind myself on a tape recorder. I am aware of how efficient I am. I reach over the seat to get my baseball uniform. It brings me closer to the man. He yearns for me. I get out of the car and hurriedly change. He watches me and is sexually aroused. I go play a terrific game of baseball. Then I rush back to the church to do my duties there.

I am acting in a small scene with a woman director. My role is to dive into a swimming pool and swim around. I do that. Then I get out and say to the director I have some suggestions to make about making the scene more dynamic and energetic with small quick edited scenes. She is not interested. She plans on doing two or three static scenes and that's it. I say to her I'm not trying to tell you your business but I am a playwright and she can use the suggestions or not, as she wishes. I am now in a large empty foyer of a public building which could be a church or a dormitory. There are large double doors that are open. People are trying to come in and I don't like that. I am trying to keep people out. A crazy man rushes in. I try to get him out but can't. So I go outside. I am standing near some storage sheds. A woman drives up and asks me for the key. I say I don't have the key. She is angry at me because she knows I have the key and she wants to store some small object. A man is with her and he comes up close to me, in a threatening way. He looks me in the eyes and says Look at this. His left nostril changes shape and becomes large and flat. His right ear does the same. From these spots he sends psychic energy out that creates a blue plastic cylinder which begins to move toward me in a threatening way. I am afraid and run back to the inside of the building I was in. I try to shut the doors. The crazy man is still there. He and I are now pounding a rhythm on a wall as a part of a performance of a play in the next room. He complements me on my "monologue" or solo part. He wants to see the play and I tell him it is five hours long. He says no problem. He and I seem to be friendly now. (359 words)

I am with a group of people in a large room. It's a work place. I try to be helpful by cleaning up things and putting them where they belong. The people are pilots and a call comes in for the Stealth Fighters to do a practice flight. I ask permission to join them. The officer thinks it over and says Not the Stealth Fighters, but you can join the crew on the cargo plane. I am disappointed but I agree, saying. At least it's flying. So now I am in the cockpit of the cargo plane. We are flying very low down a big city street with tall buildings on each side and many bridges to fly under. I am allowed to fly the plane. Someone keeps saying to me Pull it up, higher. We have to get under the bridges until we get high enough to get over them. I pull back on the steering wheel. The nose of the plane goes up and we get to our destination which is a man dangling off some high platform. The crew in the plane has a hatch open on top and he drops at the right moment and the crew pulls him in. Now we turn around to go back only very high winds start up over the water by the street. We try to fly back down the street but my instructor points out to me that if I had chosen to go as I was planning, I would have sheered off the wing. The instructor is standing at the post that would have done it outside the plane and the plane is not moving as I listen. He then suggests I fly out toward the water where there are not so many obstacles. I do so. (299 words)

I then see another can of beans being placed there and nod. The other man gets off his horse and I get on. The horse suddenly becomes a bucking bronco. I struggle to remain on the horse wondering at the irony that my regular horse (or ride) is a bronco. Now I am off the horse and writing a message for the man I like in a platter of fried eggs.

As I am hurriedly trying to finish the message for him to read, he is talking with someone else and slowly leaving. I realize he will not see the message. (196 words)

I walk slowly and stilted. There is a robot named Oscar that apparently had killed hundreds of people to get the parts needed to reconstruct me. There is a sense of fear. I am in danger. So are others. Then there is doubt. Maybe I was the one that killed them. (176 words)

She reaches for the other one and comments it is so flabby she can't get a grip on it. I angrily decide if she's going to be manipulating my nipple I might as well feel sexual. I will it to be so, but no sexual feelings. I just feel disgusted. Next I am in front of the house and crying in grief. I lie down in the snow and wave my arms making a snow angel.

I am traveling up a mountain to get to a meeting. I arrive and go into the meeting room. Nice people are wandering around. It is time to look outside and see the Great Lunum which was predicted to occur on June 11th. It is some spiritual prophesy that the world will have some special illuminecence that will be so incredibly beautiful and iridescent. I open the door and go out. I see two rainbows, beautiful clouds near a mountain. I notice that the Lunum isn't there, and wonder why we would want it anyway. Just plain ordinary nature is so beautiful, why would we want to add anything?

I am attracted to this nice man and he likes me too. We are shy. I get into a shower room. I am fully clothed and naked at the same time. A woman sits on the opposite end of the shower area, hanging out. The man walks in and sees me. I say "I'm taking a shower here." He is embarrassed and sexually excited and retreats quickly. Another man comes in and I say the same thing. I am drying off, and now I have a pretty pink dress from the 1950's on. The bra shows through the white see through insert at the top of the demur dress. The mist from the shower caused my hair to be curly and I look sweet, pretty and sexy. Subtle sexy. I walk out into the room where the man is. He is very sexually excited seeing me. We hesitate and slowly move closer for a wonderful sensual kiss. (157 words)

I am in a large school. I can't find the exit. Now I'm in a room, and Howard is there. I wonder if I could make love to him again. I think about it, wanting to be friendly, but can't quite feel right about it. He leaves, feeling fine because he has another wife. I walk down halls looking for the exit. I find one and go outside. Dotty is there. I want to know how Charla is doing. Now I go back into the school. I look in a room and go in to rest, only to realize it is a graduate student's office. I see their things on the table. I leave again. Now I am rolling on the floor with S., exercising. I tease her that her upper body will be stronger than mine, but I can beat her with isometric exercises against her legs. Now we are walking together down a hall which has like a raised roadside edge where I find crystal rocks. I examine one and decide it is nice but not spectacular enough to take. I find a nice small one I like. Then we turn a corner and I find a pink marble egg. I realize someone lost it and I take it to a nearby store. The Asian man who lost it left a letter asking if they would return it to him, should anyone be honest enough to return it. He is very happy. I find a letter and I sneak a peak at it, looking around to see if Susie or anyone else is watching. I see the name Beverley. I try to remember who she is, I know I know her, but can't place it. Maybe she was one of Howard's wives. I put the letter down, half read and go on walking with Susie. (307 words)

A cat is sick and very tired. Then it dies. Then a large beautiful tiger comes to me and stretches out on me like it's trying to lay with me in the chair. It is tired and wants to be cuddled. I hug it warmly. We sit together, enjoying each others company. (52 words)

A baby is packed in a box with other things. I become concerned for it's safety and open the box. I see that it is very hot in there and the baby has sweated so much it is lying in a pool of water and is in danger of drowning. I try to pick it up. Some green leaves fall in the water and I try to scoop them out before they melt into the water and choke the baby. I finally get the leaves out. I pick up the baby. He changes into a tiny little baby, deformed like Merle. I hold him in my hand. Now the baby changes again into a small kitten who hungrily sucks on my thumb. I being a mouse or some small animal to it so it can get some milk. The tits are brown and the right size for the kitten. It drinks. (151 words)

I am entering a store that is similar to a cement parking garage. I am there to choose a free gift. Before I can find the gift, a huge wave of water floods the entire area and I am walking down an incline. I realize I am in danger and turn to walk back up before I drown. I struggle, holding on to a curb to guide my way. I see a white water wave coming at me. I grab a plant from under the water and get out of the store. Now I am walking to find my van. I see it is parked safely up on a hill. But the way to it is cut off with a swelling river in a canyon. I will have to wait before continuing my journey. I think Ginny is there now. (140 words)

I am on a shopping trip with my girls, between the ages of 3 and 8. Dovre decides she wants to go to a church down the street. I let her go and accompany Paulina to another church which looks like a cafeteria. A Holy Bible is on our table and a woman comments on it being one of the older ones. I tell her it's not my bible, someone else must have left it there. Paulina isn't eating her plate full of eggs. I ask her why. She says the plate is dirty. I say we'll order a new one. It's OK. I worry now that I shouldn't have let Dovre walk to the other church alone. Maybe she is in trouble. I am thinking of going on shopping, when I feel my throat close up and reach my arm toward the far side of the mall where I'd left my wheelchair and water bottle. I gasp. My water, my water. Then I choke. (165 words)

I am in a pickup with Charla, Lenny, and Kyle. Kyle is driving. He pulls right up to an edge of a cliff. I say Don't do that! I am afraid we will go over the edge. And then we do. We slide off and fall. I see the huge lake and the land. We are going to die. I exchange Charla for Lenny, thinking I would have a better chance of saving a smaller child and Charla would have a better chance with Kyle. I am surprised it is Kyle and not Howard in the relationship, but I yell out "I love you all." to them and add, "I wish I'd been a better person." My last words, I thought. Then we decide to eject out of the pickup before it lands. I clutch Lenny as we fall. I try to stretch or move toward the water and manage to land in the water. We survive and I swim, holding Lenny to the shore. I lay in the water's edge with broken ribs on my right side, surprised and in shock that we lived through it. Some man is backing a boat into the lake when he sees us at the edge of the boat landing. He takes us to the hospital, which is an old house, converted to a hospital. A woman caseworker asks me some questions about Charla. I tell her that Charla has used swear words like "Bitch" at me. The caseworker wants to have the case sent to her and I say you already have the files here. She says but that's not the case. I don't understand. I think they are the same thing. Now I walk with Lucy up several flights of stairs to our hospital room. I see Kyle is in a bed, and Lenny is in the bed between Kyle and me. I am relieved. I feel very uncomfortable that I am supposedly in relationship with Kyle. Several of his buddies are there talking with him. I want a regular bed, but Lucy chooses it. I decide the hospital bed is just fine and lie down, exhausted. Some nice man is at the head of the bed trying to adjust it to make me more comfortable. (375 words)

I am in a room. Two women and myself are listening to a man named Bob how is lecturing on some subject. One of the women has already spoken on this subject and he discounts her thoughts and feelings. He is boring and not very accurate. After the speech, he realizes he has not done well and that the woman was correct. He looks for her to apologize. He respects her now. The women say it's time to go home. We walk out the building and down the street. A bus passes us with cute animals like penguins seating in them. Another bus goes by with a paper mache stork in the back. I am tired now and so the woman uses her remote control to call the car to us. It rushes past us, the bumper dangling down. It is broken. It smashes over a cliff and falls to the desert floor. We go to the edge and look over, I feel fear and vertigo. The woman was pulled into the crash and killed. She rises as a fairy angel spirit. Bob is now a red devil suited spirit and she makes him chase her in an opposite direction from us to save us. We are now tiny, like fairies and walk through a hedge with beautiful purple flowers. We see on the other side a meadow with a fairy castle at the far end. I see white dog dragons flying toward us, sent by the fairy woman to help us. I am amazed to see that we are really in a meadow right next to the outskirts of our home town. The buildings are huge and loom high above us. (282 words)

I am mopping the floors of a house that looks a bit like the Mac House. The rooms are spacious with very little furniture. I am in the kitchen and another woman is also helping me clean. I mop the kitchen, the dining room and the living room. My "husband" Jerome comes home from work and he has invited a man and his wife to dinner. I greet them in the living room where they are seated on a couch. He is brusque and asks me what I am serving for dinner. I say I thought I'd send out to the store for fish filets. He frowns and says he only eats Layton's Mayo. I say then I will buy some. I walk back into the kitchen where Jerome and the teenage boys are seated at a table. Jerome is annoyed that the man only will eat Layton's Mayo. He hates that brand. I then leave to him to decide if we get that kind of Mayo. I look over at another table and see it full of wonderful desserts, breads and casseroles. Jerome apparently made them. So we eat. I hope some of the desserts are sugar free. Now I am doing the dishes and cleaning up after the meal. The house is different now. A modern spacious house. Large windows across the back kitchen wall. I look out and see a tornado funnel coming at the house. I see several male children in the back yard. A woman is there also and is sucked up by the tornado. I run out to rescue a boy in the path of danger. I grab him just as the other boy is held upside down by the tornado. As I cling to the boy, I yell No, No at the tornado. That somehow makes it back off. I run back into the house. Now I walk back around a curved hall to the living room. I see a young man tap dancing. He had some earlier reputation as a good professional dancer, but no one recognizes him. A young woman comes in. Her name is Rose. The man and the woman are going to meet and dance together. I watch this. Now I am somewhere else, and returning home to find it destroyed by the tornado. I stand on the flat boards left and see a crudely built mail box in the shape of a simple house. Now I am staying overnight in a beautiful spacious house where Jerome and his wife live. I get up in the morning and walk through the curved hall seeing a couch and TV sets and fireplaces along the way. I decide I want to go home now rather than stay longer. (457 words)

I, the dreamer is observing myself in this dream. I am standing in the back yard of my house. Which is the front yard of a man like Tyler I am staring in horror at the flames spreading from the next door apartment I was living in to the house my kids and I live in. As I am watching, I slowly realize that I am simply standing there, watching the fire grow and spread. I suddenly remember Charla is upstairs in the bedroom close to the outside wall next to the flaming apartment. I run into the house and upstairs calling frantically for Charla. As I rush into the house, I stop and see firemen coming to put out the fire in the apartment. Then I go into the bedroom and search for Charla calling out for her repeatedly, scared she is dead. I find her in her bed sleeping and call to her to wake up. She slowly wakes up and I pick her up and run out of the house with her. Now I am back in the back yard having returned to the comfort of the man. There are several other men there and I stand there holding Charla who is actually like a limp rag doll, hanging nearly upside down and in my left hand a fist full of dollars, which are turning into fake money. Some of the young men had found some of the money I dropped as I had run across the lawn. I tell them it is mine, but they don't believe me. Apparently I had, while rescuing Charla, stood there for a moment thinking about what other important Items I should grab up and take with me. Suddenly I remember I don't know where the other two girls are. I am frantic and run back to the house, upset with, myself for not being able to remember to rescue them in the first place. How could I have forgotten them? I look in the windows from the outside to see if they are in their bedroom, on the far side of the house away from the fire. No one there. I fleetingly wonder if Howard is there. I go back in and back upstairs. I go into my bedroom, which is across the hall from Charla's bedroom. I repeatedly cross the hall to her bedroom looking in to see the condition of the meter that shows status of the fire and the electrical workings of the house. I am concerned about it. It won't go back to normal and so I worry there is something still wrong. I am tired and lie down on my bed. It is dark and I hear men coming up the stairs. A policeman is bringing Howard home, drunk. The talk at the door way of my bedroom. Then Howard comes in stumbling and falls dead drunk on my bed. I get up immediately, upset and angry. A grown daughter with several of her children and her husband come up the stairs. She comes in. I say to her. There he is, drunk. I hate that man. The husband says to me "Give him a break. It's only once." I am furious with the husband and I rush up to him, causing him to back up. I yell at him. You don't know all the things I've gone through with him. You have no right to talk to me like that." He thinks I'm crazy or a bitch. The daughter, holding one child and the other child sleeping on the floor downstairs, is now sitting on my bed with an open bible. She is upset about not being able to learn her bible lesson for tomorrow's service. She is saying "I don't remember if it was Ezeakial or Issaih or who that said whatever to whomever." I remember again I still don't know where Dovre and Paulina are. I go back down the hall and start to pass a second bedroom. I pause, go back and into that bedroom to find Dovre on the floor (she is perhaps 8 or 9 years old.) She is still sleeping. I shake her repeatedly to wake her. Finally she sleepily responds. I find Paulina/Ellie as a toddler, maybe 2 years old, in the bed all curled up and sleeping. I pick her up and try to wake her as well. She turns into a plastic toy. I carry them both out of the room, relieved to have found them and not understanding how they could have slept through so much for so long! I recheck the meter. I ask my daughter's husband to look it over as well. He says it's fine. I don't believe him and go in to look again. I pull open the top drawer in a dresser to see a stack of old letters. Love letters, I think but as I look at them, I see they are letters from men I knew long ago but not real close. One was a military young man named Brent. I close the drawer. I look at the meter again. I return to my bedroom. There is now another bed and several phones on it. One of them rings. I am surprised because it is the middle of the night. I answer it to hear Dovre asking me Do I have a phone? I hang up. I then explain to my grown daughter how I was so slow to respond to the fire. I told her I just stood there in the apartment looking at the small flames thinking it will go out on its own. Then as it spread, I watched it, dully not feeling any concern. Then when it was almost too late, I suddenly realized the danger for me and my children. I feel stupid and neglectful. I feel guilty for not remembering Dovre and Paulina. (982 words)

Charla is a beautiful child preparing for making it big in Hollywood. I am her chaperone and helper. She has perfect blonde hair in a bouffant style. We are at a place where the Hollywood hopefuls come to train and be discovered. There are hundreds of them. I am filled with love and pride of how beautiful Charla is. The scene is surrealistic, neither indoor or outdoor. No walls. Charla is tap dancing. I say that tap dancing is a strange style of dance. A narrator remarks that there is always one or two specially talented people that come in and are recognized immediately. One dances by. Charla is trying to sneak past me wearing three different dresses, one on top of the other. She's trying to meet a young boy somewhere. I tell her she can't fool me. I tell her to go back. Another woman is around. Now I am flying in some sort of structure like a parking garage. Only this is where artists who didn't make it are stuck forever. It's the Loser Highway. The flying space is like the curved way cars drive in parking garages. I see other losers caught in there, one man tethered to the structure and trying to fly. It is very sad. Another man is heart broken because he created wonderful artistic pictures in there but now that he is trying to return to regular earth, the pictures disintegrate and are ruined. All his talents and work destroyed. Now I am told to fly over the producer's desk. I fly over there. He is a big noisy man. Flashy dresser. (270 words)

A woman friend and I are Hollywood stars. We are shopping and having fun. We meet these two men and they join us. It's a sort of outdoor mall. We try on different blouses and they try on shirts. The shirts are velvet and very soft to the touch. The man I'm with comes toward me and I stroke the large lacy collar of his shirt to feel the sensual softness of the shirt. My friend's man comes over in a more tailored version. I touch his shirt also. He and I are attracted to each other. He likes me to touch him. We walk on. My man and my friend wander off and her man (like the game host on Hollywood squares, Tom) and I sit and talk. We clearly are growing more affectionate and really like each other. There is hesitation because he is my friend's man. Suddenly it begins to rain grasshoppers. I don't like that and Tom and I duck into a corner of a store front. The other man ducks into another place nearby. Tom is very efficient and helpful asking the proprietor of the store if we can come in. He says no. Tom goes in to get what we will need to be comfortable. A Mexican man comes up to me and asks if I want to buy a cover to put up to protect us. I say You will have to ask the gentleman. I really like that he is taking over and arranging everything for my comfort. Tom returns with several pairs of rubber boots, a bottle of something and something to eat. The Mexican man is putting up the cover which causes Tom and I to have to cuddle close together. We look at each other longingly. He adores me and I feel filled with love and sexual excitement. He tenderly kisses me. I love it. But I pull back, remembering he is my friend's man. He smiles gently at me and says, I won't do that again until I've talked with Carol and broken off with her. Carol is now with my man and they seem to be fine with each other. It won't be long now and Tom and I will be able to make wild passionate love. I look forward to it. (385 words)

I am in bed with Jennifer H. I sleep like I did with Howard, always facing away from him because I didn't want to be close, because then he'd want sex. She falls out of bed on the floor and twitches. I look over at her wondering if she is having an epileptic seizure. She gets back in bed. I had turned to sleep in that direction but when she got in bed again, I turned back to face away from her. I fell the same resistance and guardedness I felt with Howard, like he was going to pounce on me. Now we are out of bed. Jennifer is upset and wants to talk about our relationship. I do not want to talk about it. I avoid her. We are actually in a sort of camp ground area, even though the bed is a regular double bed. Charla is there now. She and I are talking in a friendly way. Jennifer finally bursts out with the question about what is our relationship. I say I don't want to talk about it. She says you won't even look at me. I say I'm sorry. I can't do it. That's the way I am. I have trouble looking at people. It's me, not you. She is very sad. I repeat that I am sorry if I hurt her, but I just don't want a relationship with her. I say Charla is really the only person I've ever had a real emotionally good relationship with. Jennifer sadly leaves. (255 words)

I am still at the campground where Jennifer H. left. A man comes by and we talk. We like each other. Charla and I are packing things up to leave. Another silly man comes by and makes friends with the first man. They talk about how they are Indians. The silly man is a Crow Indian and the other names a tribe. I get into a small black car, which had been Jennifer's. She had left it. It has a clutch. It is easy to drive, but I will tire of the clutch pedal soon. I am waiting for the man to come by and drive that away while I drive my van. The man comes playfully around a corner wrapped up in a blanket like a cocoon. He and Charla are playing games. I chuckle. We all get along fine. (141 words)

I am being pursued by a Nazi woman who is trying to capture me. I run but she keeps after me. I run up a long flight of stairs. I know I am inside a building but there are not normal rooms, it's like a stage facade of stairs and windows and a door across a long drop off where the hall would have been. A door opens on my left as if from across a hall. A man, like Robert Taylor comes out and sees me. He is a nazi also. The woman catches up with me and I am forced to sit on a couch on a sort of balcony. Other female nazis are there. Robert sits next to me on my left, very close and ups his arm around my shoulder to grasp my right hand. He uses a double pronged needle to inject something into me. I struggle but I am trapped. He begins to skin my hand with a small knife. I don't feel much pain, like only the top layer of skin is being removed. It is being skinned off like a glove. I beg him to stop, but he smiles and continues. Then suddenly he is sexually excited and says I want to do her. I am now still seated on the couch but he is naked and on top of a beautiful naked woman with large breasts. Her figure is shaped like Seven of Nine's on Star Trek Voyager. I see his thin penis dangling down as he gets on top of her. His skin is very dark brown, compared to the white of the woman's skin. I see her face as he thrusts very business like in her. He comes quickly. The woman got no sexual enjoyment of the rape. She looks pained and scared. I take this moment to run again. (311 words)

I am running from the Nazi's. I duck into a cross dressing bar. Ellie is in there dressed as a woman and so are all the men. I am a woman, dressed as a woman pretending to be a cross dressing man. I sit at a table with two pretty men. I am wearing a maroon long velvet dress with a scoop neckline and slits up the back to reveal my shapely legs. Ellie knows its me and pretends to not know me, but smiling at me. A midget with a limp, male and dressed as a male, comes up to me and asks me to dance. I say yes. I stand and take his hand, walking and semi dragging him along. We weave through the tables and find a small empty spot and begin to dance. Then the midget falls in love with me. Then some regular non gay men come in to harass the cross dressers. They also bring jeans and leather pants. The cross dressers are choosing which ones fit. I pass a few along, holding them up to me. I say too bad I'm so fat. Some cross dresser says women's pants are always too small for me. I see that Robert Taylor, the Nazi, and his men have entered. I try to walk out but they capture me. We are walking down the front steps of the bar when the midget flings himself at me to knock me down the stairs hoping he would kill me so that I wouldn't suffer at the torture the Nazi's were going to inflict on me. I fall down the stairs and so does he. I am unhurt and he is injured. He begs for my address. Someone says it and he runs to a wood box just outside my house so he can live close to me. As I am walking down the sidewalk, a woman in a wheelchair with dark hair and missing legs up to the knees and the under half of her breast cut off wheels up to me. She shows me her breast which she will reconstruct later, she says. I ask her for her car keys. She says you'll never make it. But she throws me the keys. I make a break for it and jump into her small convertible car in the yard next to my house that we were walking toward. It is a silly plastic car. But I start the motor and race away with Robert in hot pursuit. I crash through the fence and a metal pole and drive down the streets. A woman says you can't do that with that car, it's plastic. But I succeed anyway. I abandon the car and run into a shed and hide under some hay. I burrow through it to the back wall, ripping off some of the boards and crawling through. Several men, while talking with each other, come close and look in. I am somehow in plain sight even though supposedly hidden. They pretend not to see me as they are actually undercover agents for my side. Somehow now I am the man and I am having sex with a woman. I am thrusting at her from behind and on top. I am sexually excited. (545 words)

I am a part of a class. Someone suggests some study tips and I write them down on a young woman student's notebook for her. I tell her I did that to help her. I feel interfering but it is for a good reason. Now, I am in an audience. A woman on stage asks a question. I walk quickly up the stairs to on stage to answer it. I answer it correctly. She gives me a look meaning What a jerk. Always has to be a know it all. I then walk backstage, having had the intention of leaving early and this is a good opportunity. She follows me and says you're going the wrong way. I say, no, I want to go downtown. I leave, opening the pretty glass door near the large window. (like it was a house, not a theater.) I walk downtown. (147 words)

I am in a classroom. I am making something artistic, using a paint brush. I am seated because a man teacher is lecturing. I look up to see him looking at me disapprovingly for doing something else while he lectures. I continue painting but then stop. I put the paint brush on the edge of a desk. Then I see that large globs of yellow paint are dripping off the brush. I don't know what to do, so I put my hand under it to catch the globs as they fall. Now I have a messy hand full of paint. I look around and see a box, under a daybed. I put it there. I'll save it for another young woman to use in her project. Now some other man is announcing that this session was taped by NPR. I say to the teacher if I'd known it was NPR, I'd have written a real poem. (meaning the one I read I'd just casually written, it wasn't a really good piece of work.) I see I have black oily stuff all over my hands and I try to clean them off. I want to help this young woman do her project before I leave. I want to talk with the teacher before he leaves. I am attracted to him. He then walks out and I feel disappointed. Later a woman sits next to me and I realize she is the teacher. I'm not as interesting in talking with her. (249 words)

I am in a driveway with a woman and Lucy. I am handing Lucy cards. She stares at it and then I tell her what's on it. I then remember that she is totally blind. I feel stupid doing this and embarrassed. The woman suggests we go to a store that is down a steep dirt path. I say not now. I am interested in the clothes they sell there but I am worried about if the path is accessible or not. Later I change my mind. I call Lucy and ask if she can come over and help me go to the store. She says sure. Justin is home all afternoon. I remind her not to be late because it is 2:30 PM and the store will close and I need to take my pickup to get more gas. They come over. Lucy and my father get in the back of the pickup. I help them get comfortable. I ask Justin if there is enough room for him. He says no (even though there was). So Justin and their child get up in the front seat. I am driving. We go to someplace where there is a mechanic. He will fix some part of the pickup that has been broken for a long time. Two men are there talking about the event that is going to happen on the huge snow field right in front of us. I decide I want to get a good seat, so Justin and I go to a corner on the left of the snow field. I park my wheelchair. I decide it will be too uncomfortable sitting in the chair for a long time, so I put my purse on the ground and then I scoot out of the chair and to the ground in front of the foot pedals. I am crowded and uncomfortable. I move the purse to the chair seat. I tell Justin he can sit in my chair. I am worried that my chair and me take up too much space. (342 words)

I am in a house with many many rooms. It used to be "my" house, and I am selling it to Abner. I realize that I mostly live in one or two rooms. I tell Abner there are some incredible rooms in this house... But I haven't used them in years. I am cleaning up to make ready for Abner to take over the house. I look out a window and see beautiful birds. Someone said look at the Thunderbirds. I see exotic colored birds, greens, spots of red and yellow. They are actually having sex. I see a huge white feathered bird that looks like an eagle. I'm not sure if it is alive. I go outside to speak to Abner. Howard is working in a garden. So is Abner, further up the path. Later some man and myself walk down a hill in a wooded area behind the house and enjoy the spacious beautiful area. Perhaps a river runs through it. (163 words)

I am supposed to give a presentation with Oprah watching. I am digging around in my suitcase for the video Ophrah wants me to show and the file folders of information I will present. I can't find them. The audience is waiting in the other room of this house and I chatter on while I search to keep them occupied and interested. I tell them of a journey from Central America to my home in Connecticut with a car I was transporting from one place to the other. I am telling this story for the benefit or entertainment of a man who had a similar experience. I can't find the stuff after looking three times through the suitcase. I cheerfully say to Ophrah and the waiting audience this isn't a problem. I know the material by heart and will give them a good presentation without the material. I apologize to Ophrah for losing her video. I know she considers it important and informative. (163 words)

I am at a dance. Michael J. Fox is there and is dancing with a woman. I dance alone. No one invited me to dance. I feel sad. Michael is watching. He then comes over to me and invites me to dance. I am surprised and pleased. We dance. Then he continues to chat with me after the dance is over, walking with me. He has his arm around my shoulder in a friendly way. I am surprised to realize he is so short. He has to reach up to put his arm around my shoulder. I remember I am standing now and that is why he seems shorter. We walk out of the building together. He takes me to his family's home. A large tent where people are eating and talking. He introduces me to his father and another relative, maybe an uncle. They are very impressed with the fact that he has brought a woman home to meet them. They are speculating if we are getting married or not. Michael says to them, of course we will get married. I am surprised and pleased again. The family is large and friendly. Now the family home is a huge mansion, with a large green field for a front lawn. We are walking down the hall when a man tells me his father cheats on his wife as is the custom in this family. I am now outside looking at the mansion from across the field. I begin walking across toward the mansion. I see vendors with tables. I am hungry and ask to buy some food. The woman says you have money, don't you? I say I'm sure I have some on me and if not enough, then we'll go up to the house. She is very suspicious. She follows me. I ask her what is the price of this dish of ice cream? She says $25. I am shocked at the outrageous cost. It must be because this is such a rich neighborhood. (335 words)

I am in a huge black cave and the German soldier comes up to me and grabs my butt to feel if he wants to rape me or not. My butt is flabby and I hope that means he will not be interested in me. He walks away, still thinking about it. I am starving and ask a woman how to get food. She says we all have to find our own. Another woman offers me a plastic container with lasagna in it. I eat one bite and then the soldier is back wanting to rape me. I feel resigned and angry and hungry and tired. (106 words)

I am in some large building and am in charge of keeping people from going up to the 2nd and 3rd floors. I see a black man and several white people going up the stairs. I scurry over saying You can't go up there. They laugh at me and go up anyway. I go up there to get them out, worried that they will steal things. I see a group of old ladies at a long table in one hall. I ask what they are doing. They say they are attending a workshop that will last 60 days. I decide it's OK for them to be there. I go back downstairs, tired and overwhelmed. Then I realize I could hire someone to keep an eye on the upstairs. I go to a desk where a woman (Diane of Uni house) sits with a hat that says Wonder Woman. She is very busy and doesn't pay any attention to me. I see Ginny. She tells me she is staying at a different hotel and will be having dinner out with other friends. I am surprised and a bit hurt. Then I see Ginny is sad. I try to cheer her up. I decide to join her at the other hotel. She points down a hall and says I can get my key holder there. I go down there and see a Christmas tree display with crochet white key holders. Is this it? I ask. She says yes. (246 words)

I am walking down a sidewalk. I am looking down the street to see if there is a grocery store down that way. I think maybe there is one, even though that direction is toward the fancy government and museum buildings. A man calls out to me to come on down that way. I abruptly turn and walk the opposite way. They laugh at me for being afraid. I think they are ruffians who will lure me there and hurt me. Now I am walking toward a theater building. Really good performers that I respect are there. They want me to join them. I struggle up a steep ramp to get to the top of the roof of the building. Sparky and others are there and want me to act in this Shakespearean play. And also direct them in it. I agree to do so. But now I am naked and crawling on my belly because I am paralyzed from the waist down. There are two people in wheelchairs that are acting in this play. I am proud of that (one of them is me.) But I am embarrassed to find myself naked and crawling on the ground as I go about my duties of creating an excellent play. (209 words)

I am lying on a bed, trying to sleep. Howard is seated near me. We talk. He is being helpful, trying to help me understand something that would be good for me to know. Later, He is lying in the bed with me. I "wake up" in the dream and realize that Howard is dead. He can't be there in my bed. I turn and look. He is not there. Then he talks to me. So now I'm wondering if I really looked or if I dreamed I looked. I am confused if he's really there or if I am dreaming it. Now my Mother comes in with a gift for me. A display holder of many different pens, all bright and interesting colors. I exclaim happily she couldn't have given me a better gift. I love multi colored pens. I hope she doesn't look into the living room where I have my own set just like it already. I don't want to make her upset or unhappy. (168 words)

A kind man, like Dwight B., comes over to talk with me at a party. He is gentle. As we talk I realize I like him. Then he slowly reveals that he knew me years ago when I was going to school and married to Howard. I now remember he was at OSU in a class. He liked me then. I look in his eyes and realize he loved me then and still does love me. We sit on a couch and cuddle, slowly getting closer and closer. Now it is the next morning and I awake in his families house. I am exhausted from partying all night and my arthritis hurts. I have bandages on my left hand, which is deformed like my right hand. I am bare foot. And walking with crutches. It hurts to get up and move. His family is nice to me, observing to see what kind of woman he brought home. I hear one of the children talking about Dwight's dream all these years of combining our foster homes we've created and working together. I tell the child I didn't ever do that. I don't have any foster homes. (195 words)

I am visiting Mary Sue and Dwan. I want to see their remodeled house and the progress they are making. I look at the outside. I see new window panels just like the ones in my remodeled room. Long and narrow. There are still more to put in but they have put in more since I last looked. Now we are inside. Dwan and I are talking. She asks me about being a lesbian. I grimace and say I just don't feel comfortable with it. Dwan says why not? I say I don't know, it doesn't feel right. She laughs at me, because she and Mary Sue are quite happy together. I then look into a bedroom they remodeled. It is very pretty with a double bed and lots of pillows and comforters. I see another bedroom and look in there also. They are doing a good job of remodeling their house. (152 words)

I am a young beautiful model in a swim suit at the beach. William Shatner is there. As I walk past him, I make comments that are sarcastic because he was being self centered and arrogant thinking I would fall for him. He has the beginnings of a pot belly and gray hair. He jokes back with me and we build a kind of friendship based on our mutual respect for wit and fast thinking. He follows me as I walk through a crowd of people on the beach and lie down on a sand dune, between two other women who are sun bathing. I ask one how her relationship is going. She says they are about to get divorced. I am sad for her and say That is the saddest part of a relationship.

I and two girls, perhaps my "children," are walking up a path with a bunch of other people. We are going to the top of a mountain ridge. As I approach the top, I feel small earthquakes. Then I see a steam vent. The steam is pouring out. I realize we are on an active volcano that is about to erupt. I turn, with the girls and run downhill, yelling to the other people that the volcano is erupting. We run and run, then I see a river. There are wild animals in it, swimming fast to escape the volcano. I see elephants, alligators and mountain lions. We get in the water with them, knowing they are just as afraid of the volcano as we are and wont bother us. We swim and swim until the river is now dry and a small long tunnel. We run, hoping we are not trapped in there. Finally we get through to the other side but the lava is converging on us. We are then rescued in the nick of time by a helicopter just as the lave surrounds us on an island of rock. (192 words)

["Van parked in the dark."] I am a young dark haired woman, a teen really, that lives at a small residential school. An out of the way place. I request a small model of the school be place at a perspective where I can draw it. I am in an open field. A woman places it. I keep asking her to move it here and there, because it is so far away I can hardly see it. It has classical designs with columns and a domes ceiling. Finally I apologize to her and say I'll just walk over to it and see it there. I must walk into the dark wooded bushy area to go past my van parked there. I feel a moment of fear at the dark wooded area and then muster up my courage and walk in there. The scene shifts and I am preparing a meal in the cottage where I live with the other young teen women. It is a beautiful kitchen with many interesting wine kind of bottles. Someone keeps asking me how long I've known this one student who is famous for some reason. I can't remember but I think it was before I was sixteen, perhaps when I was thirteen. The principle comes in to have dinner with us. A man teacher is plotting to tie him up. The teacher gets these teen boys and while the principle is seated on a open canopy thing with a web of ropes, he jokingly ties one arm to the ropes. The principal thinks its a joke, but before he knows it, he is tied up and can't escape. The teacher says to someone You probably wonder why I chose to teach in such an obscure place.

["Lazy PA."] I am on a motorcycle wearing black leather jacket and a white scarf around my neck. I am driving on a mountain road. Suddenly a man in a car comes around me and stops, blocking the lane of traffic. He's out to get me. I turn and drive up a steep gravel road to Ginny's "house." I try to drive in but finally get off the motorcycle and walk in, locking the doors. The scene shifts. I am walking down a city street. I want to take a bath, even though it isn't scheduled until tomorrow. I tell my PA to prepare the special stretcher, bathtub we have. She is annoyed and wants to wait until tomorrow. I insist. I lie down, on the stretcher which has a special head rest for the shampooing. It feels comfortable, even though I am outside on the sidewalk. I believe I am clothed as well. Again, the scene shifts and I am in my van as a passenger. My PA stops in traffic in the turning lane and lets me out. I am annoyed she is blocking traffic. I am standing. She says she'll bring my wheelchair but she wants to use it too, She's tired. I am confused and a bit upset with her. She parks the van up the road and brings a manual wheelchair. Now I am walking down the sidewalk with another woman. I see a store window display of many large tropical fish, all flat and orange gold color with one large round black spot on it. Someone picks one up and bites off its tail. I feel queasy. They bite into the body and I can't look any more. My friend sees a display of round pendants on the sidewalk for sale. She lies down on the sidewalk to see them better. I bend over and look too. (311 words)

["Registering for classes."] I am at a college, standing outside the building in a long line. It is time for registration. The doors open and the people rush in, I manage to be third in line and would like to be first because I only have a quick question. But I am asked by the woman teacher to wait over at another table. I sit and wait, watching the masses of students milling around frantically trying to get registered. I wait a long time. Finally it is my turn. I try to ask my question but the words are confusing and I am frustrated, Now I go to another room. I am looking through cupboards and seeing food things people had brought. I see three different kinds of bread. Nothing I am too interested in eating. I decide this isn't the right place for me. Lots of milling students. I ask a woman there something. She shows me a weird expanding cane, walker. She suggests I use that. I say it's too big and complicated. Then she shows me a more regular cane, I hold it backwards, She shows me the "right" way to hold it. I walk a few steps. Every time the cane touches the floor with a tap it is echoed through the clock. I say this doesn't work for me. I decide to leave the classroom. I go the bookstore. I am thinking of taking some classes and want to see what the books would be and how much they will cost. I am in a corner of the bookstore looking a shelves of books. Math books, science fiction. I almost buy some and then frustrated, I put them back. I feel really upset because I remember I've done this a number of times, taken classes and then not finishing them. A frequent dream motif but it feels so real I wonder unhappily if I've really done it again. I find one class in linguistics and am genuinely interested, thinking it would be a good class to take. I look at the description a weird word, looking something like division department or something. It would be too slow and tiring. (361 words)

["Growing new fingertips."] A man sits to my left. We are in a class. Only we are the only two students. He asks a question of the woman teacher. He says he had a friend a woman, who told him that after you get your Ph.D. you need to focus on one thing and study it. He wants to know how to find her. He talks about Mr. Spock and science fiction books. The teacher is annoyed. She says, so then your question is about finding an old friend? I absentmindedly bite off the tip of a newly grown finger tip and spit it out like a fingernail on the floor. Then I am shocked that I had done that. I feel a bit sick as well. There are two tiny well formed healthy new fingers growing. (134 words)

["At home in the outback."] I am creating a play. It has comedy and family stuff and relationships in it. There is a stage in the living room of the family home I am in. My sister Lydia is helping me set up things on the stage. We are placing things we no longer want on the stage. A toaster oven. A TV. Junk. I ask a woman if it's all right to burn some of these things. She says yes. I walk behind the stage and rearrange some of the things. I decide I want to keep the TV and the toaster oven. I move them farther from the main area so they won't burn with the rest. I walk back around to the front of the stage. Jerome is there. I ask him if he will watch the play. He laughs and sneers saying it is insignificant. He has no interest in something that isn't big and important. I am insulted. I return sarcastic remarks back at him. Then he sneers at the skirt I am wearing. He names the brand. He says he can't take seriously anyone wearing a "Bobbir" skirt. I sneer back and say so who is being caught up in insignificant things. Brand names of clothes. OH boy, such important stuff. He feels embarrassed. I got him there, Now I strike a match and try to light the things on fire. The curtain is closed in anticipation of the burning as a performance. It goes out so I start balling up pages of newspaper. I hand some to Lydia. We prepare the papers and stuff them around the objects. I light another match or two and the fire starts. Now I am Whoopi Goldberg in an all white skirt and blouse. I have traveled to perhaps the Australia outback, although it looks like a suburban neighborhood. Jerome had traveled there to learn about birds. I meet a woman and her daughter, both black. The woman welcomes me graciously. And is walking me to the back yard, through the house. She is saying she is almost ready for the hunt. She must finish filling the bathtub with water. The hatchet is ready to chop off the bird's head. I feel a bit queasy about that part. The girl is talking about two birds she has already seen, one an Owl, she says. The woman smiles. She had misnamed the type of bird. I am determined however to participate as well as I can and as fully as I can in the ceremonious hunt. The girl and I are being initiated, I guess. We walk out to the back yard. Black men and Jerome (white) are out there. The ritual begins. I watch as the girl contorts her face into an impossible mask like position, literally sucking in her nose until she looks like a bird skull. I am impressed. Now I must transform. I also do that. Jerome is amazed and impressed I am able to not only understand the importance of this experience but am also able to do it. We have earned the right to remain in the hunt. Apparently we must transform our faces to be able to walk up to the bird, as it will not recognize us without human like features. (546 words)

["The dreams fly me."] I am aware that I am in that between waking and dream state. I feel charged energy. I don't want to wake myself up and yet I want to examine what is going on. I am standing on a high second story platform in a huge room. I am wearing my blue velvet dress, A man has something in a box. I open the box and green shapes fly at me and absorb into my body, mostly in my right shoulder, from the back. I am afraid because I realize these things, are entities of some kind and they are taking over my body. I also realize they are dreams the man had captured in his box. He demands his dreams back, but they beg me not to let him imprison them again. They force me to fly out over the empty expanse of this huge room. I am afraid they will release me and I will fall and be hurt, but they are deeply in me and they fly me down toward the group of men standing on the floor. They fly me right above the man as I tell the man for them that they will never return to him. He is angry and would hurt me if he could reach me. The dreams fly me back up out of his reach. Now one of the dreams is the green shape of an angel like woman who is right behind me holding me as if to ensure we can not be separated. She is whispering to me information. I listen, feeling empathy for them. They had been cooped up too long and are resentful and angry. Intense feelings. I want to change something. I wonder what I want to happen. I then scream loudly, as if I were in fear. I wait for the images to transform to frightening things, but they don't. I am kind of glad. I don't know what to do or what I want to do with this lucidity. (335 words)

["Violin sharing."] It is necessary to move the computer. My daughter Ellie and a man I am married to move it for me. I go into the room they moved it to, in some apartment. At first I don't like the new set up. I say I like to look out the window when I'm thinking. Then I see a window in the right position. They move it again. Now I am facing a window and a window is on the right. I like that, except, now the door is partially blocked to the outside. I don't like that. I walk to the window and look out. We are high up on a hill. I look down and see a man walking up the hill toward our door. He is perhaps Eastern Indian. I wait in anticipation for his message. Now the scene changes, and he has brought me to a meeting in a room. He is seated in a large easy chair, more like a sofa. He smiles invitingly and suggests I sit with him. I do. A woman is his helper. She comes over and they talk. I realize this is a spiritual meeting and the topic is violins. Everyone is learning to play one. I comment I used to play one. He smiles delighted at that information. He leaves for a moment. I am seated next to another man who is struggling to learn how to play his violin. I give him some advice about second position, but he doesn't understand. So I use his violin to show him. I feel rusty and am aware my fingers are deformed. His violin is very unusual. It has cork pads with finger indents in each place where you would play a note. They are large and so the placement of the fingers is not the same as on a regular violin. I show him where you place your fingers for second position. On the violin are extra strings and numbers like 5 and 6 with arrows. The bridge is in the wrong place and the strings aren't long enough for all the positions. I struggle with these differences. Now the man has returned. He is seated on the floor next to the couch we are on. A woman is seated to my left. He smiles at me with happiness at my violin skills. The woman reaches down to him and pits her arms around his chest from behind and pulls him up to sit on the couch. His body is apparently paralyzed. It is fat and no muscle tone. Like a blubbery seal. (432 words)

I lie on a couch watching this silly drama. Finally she leaves and both the young man and I are glad to see her go. Now I go into the kitchen. I see a huge dish of hamburger with what looks like chocolate chips in it ready to be cooked. I show this to the young man and he says they are corn chips. We decide to cook it even though it was left by some other roommate. Later, I look into the cooking pot and it is more like a stew with chunks of beef and funny looking veggies. A bunch of string like white things. (174 words)

["Strange skies."] I am traveling with Ginny. She is driving, she says look at the sky. She says see if you can find pieces and put them together to see a face. I decide to look for pieces and make Charla's face. I lie down on the seat, my head near Ginny's lap so I can see the sky through the cars front window. Ginny says look for the dark parts. I look. It is very dark. Then I see a funnel cloud, then another and another. I am concerned they will touch down and become tornadoes. But they don't. As I am looking up in the sky, I feel the car dip downhill suddenly and sit up to see what's going on. We are at the top of a hill on a very steep road. We are going fast and I nearly fall off the seat. I hang on. We arrive at the bottom of the hill and travel on. Now the straight road is across a waterway, with the tide out. We see the wet mud on both sides of the road. I say we'd better be careful to note the tide times so we return before the tides come in and cover the road. We suddenly see a shallow sheet of water over the road. We slow down and I am now in my wheelchair, tipping over. The car is gone. I decide to dive in the water to try and save the chair but at the last moment the chair rights itself and I am standing on the road, not dumped in the water. We get to the end of the road. Now we see rooms built into the rock wall. It is a University. We see several young women in a uniform of red and white horizontal stripes on the sweater top and white skirts. The school uniform. We see a cafe and look in the window at the food. We are aware we need to keep an eye on the tides so we can go home. (340 words)

["Competition then deliberate ruin."] I am on a football team of women. We are playing a team of men. We play hard and well surprising the men. We actually win, Now the two teams are lined up facing each other to shake hands and congratulate each other. The male captain tells us we have only 25 minutes to do the individual handshaking and remarks to each player on the other team. Our captain, like Captain Janeway, is supposed to tell the team members but she strangely wanders away suddenly. I as the second officer walk down the line and repeat to each player the news. Then I see that the Captain is in a small runabout space craft. She is recklessly driving around. Then she drives out toward space and crashes on a space station. I see flames billow up. This is so odd for her. Now Worf is suddenly taken over by a need to drive the silly slow and monotonous race cars that look like soap box derby cars at a reckless pace. He causes an accident. I am putting slowly in my blue car and see it, Now the police take him and me to jail. Somehow I get out of my cell and walk outside to the city street. I see that the door to the police station which had had the sign "Police" on it when we went in the first time now has a sign that says The Mind. I realize then that we are on another planet and the aliens are making us do these reckless actions and observing us. I go back inside to see Worf is out of his cell. I call attention to the desk officer that we are out of our cells. We walk around looking the place over, not worried about being caught or harmed. Now that I know, they have no power over me.

["Can't find medical help."] I have fallen off a steep cliff hillside. I have injured my left leg in two places. Perhaps the bones are broken. I am trying to crawl up the hillside to where Ellie is at the top. I call out for help. It is very painful and a difficult struggle. Now I am walking with a limp and with pain down a hall at a University. I am looking for the medical office where someone can help me. I can't find it. I ask directions of the many passing students. They tell me where to go and I follow their directions, only to find another classroom. Now another male student says it is in another building. He walks me outside and points to a sidewalk and tells me how to get there, but I am confused and ask for more direction, except he's gone already. I am very frustrated. (149 words)

["Scary dream conference."] I am at some university at a dream conference, seated at a table. I am working on my lap top computer. I call up some program and now can reach into the screen and pull out real money. Mostly pennies and some square coins, some Canadian coins, and a few dollar coins. As I do this, a man comes by, behind me and is showing some people some aura images on the wall behind me he can see. He says he has some evidence of the murders that happened here sometime ago. I feel a bit skeptical. Then I look and see the image of a woman on the wall and feel a bit frightened. Maybe that is the murderer's spirit. Ellie is somewhere in the background throughout the entire dream. (131 words)

["Interesting house."] I am attending a workshop being held outside on the grass. I sit in the aisle so I can see. There are four of us and we stagger our seating so we can see better. Later I decide to sit on the grass near the back, but I can't hear the woman speaking. She is demonstrating some skill or technique. Then I decide to move closer up front. It is a 15 minute break and I walk up to the front. The woman who is teaching and I talk. She decides to go see something I have at my house. Her friend is driving a pickup truck and we get in and go to my house. Then as we are returning to the workshop, we stop at her house for a moment for her to get something or do something. The driver is driving fast and we bounce over bushes to get to the back door. I am annoyed and surprised at the harsh bouncy ride. We walk up two small steps and enter the kitchen. I stand there waiting as the woman goes in to do something. Several of her children wander through rambunctious and noisy. I look down to see twin white kittens playing with my shoelaces. One kitten at each shoe. I laugh, it is cute. I notice the ceiling which has a mural of sunsets and some kind of fish motif. It is beautiful, lush reds and other sunset colors. I see it continues on into the other room and I sneak into the other room to see. I am now very curious about the house. This room is large and spacious. The next room has a brick floor, a fireplace, and lovely woods. Her husband (like Chris of 7 stars daycare neighbor) is a wimpy house husband and inept. He is in this room. I look to my left and see the bedroom. I walk into it, there are 2 steps down to get in. A beautiful four poster bed. As I walk through the room and the other door, I see a small ramp built. That's good. If I buy the house, it can be made accessible. I walk down a hall, which has railings like a stairwell which opens so that there aren't walls, but open spaces between the banister poles. You can look through to the other rooms. There are many more rooms in this interesting house. I want to buy it. I return to the kitchen. I call for the woman. I say don't we need to get back to the workshop? It was a 15 minute break and we've been gone an hour. She doesn't care. Then I see an old woman (maybe late 50's or 60's) and a man the same age. They are moving into the house. They are strangers to each other but I get the feeling they are going to grow to love each other in this wonderful house. They are using a small round disk to cut holes in something. Like one uses a cookie cutter in dough. (513 words)

["Blocked from traveling home."] I am driving my van. Dovre is in the passenger seat. I am annoyed with her because she has the tape recorder and the radio over on her side of the van. I tell her I want them back close by me so I can turn them on and off when I want to. She doesn't want to do it. I then point to the dashboard and reach for one of the cutout areas you can punch out to put the devices in. I say Shall I put it here? She is mad at me and doesn't answer. I almost punch out the area. Then I look ahead and see a barrier on the road. Lovely tall glass vases lined up, blues and pinks and empty. I pull over to the side of the road. Now what! How am I going to get home to M City, which is where we are headed. I get out of the van and start walking down the 2 lane curvy mountain road. Paulina says You can't park here. It's a no parking zone. I say no problem, I only parked the wheelchair, not the van. Then I remember that I did park the van but dismiss the problem and walk on to find someone to talk to about this problem of the barrier. I see a long line of beautiful glass pieces displayed similar to the vases of the barrier. I keep walking. Now I see some people, and am in some large building. I am looking for the person in charge. I see a large room where some people are. This is some small town festival. I go out of the building. I now have a cell phone and the phone number of the woman in charge. I call her and explain that this is the only way I can get home without turning around, backtracking and finding another way. I explain I am a woman in a wheelchair and it would be better if I could get through. She says I could go back to Sweet Home and go that way. I say but that would take so long. Then she says OK, we can figure out a way to let you through. I thank her, pointing out that the crowds are thinned out now, since it is late afternoon. It shouldn't be too much of a problem. The small town is named Wheeler. (403 words)

["Cleaning up."] I am outdoors at a university like setting. A man points out a device that landed on the lawn. I go with him to examine it out of curiosity. He wonders how it landed and I point out the small handkerchief sized parachute. I wonder how it got up there in the first place. I then see a bar with railings with string or something that had snapped at each rail indicating it was tied to some other device and rocketed up then broke free and landed. Dwight comes over and saws the bar in half. I am shocked and tell him how stupid to do that. It wasn't ours to mess with. He is frustrated and upset with himself and surely doesn't like me saying what he already knows. I call him stupid again. The man tells me I shouldn't say that. Now I am frustrated and upset with myself because I know it is wrong to do and doesn't help anything besides. Dwight walks away. I go into a Home Economics class. There dirty dishes piled in one of the three sinks lining the two walls. I feel helpful and decide I will wash them for however left them to soak. Now another woman is helping and I put the glasses and some bowls in her sink to wash. I wash the utensils. It feels good to be cleaning up for someone else. (235 words)

["Sweet loving man."] I am in bed in some bedroom. It is partially dark. The door opens and a naked good looking man, tall and well built, comes in and gets in bed with me. We begin to make love. It is exquisite. I feel every move and respond with intense sexual excitement as well as a feeling of love. It is mutual. Then the door opens and people walk in. I feel embarrassed and he moves to another bed and I sit in the bed, very frustrated and also concerned about who these people are. Then he is lying in my bed again, only he is pretending to have died. Suddenly, the people are sucked out of the room and across the hall where a hole opens up in the wall and they disappear in there. They must have been aliens. Now that they are gone, I lie on top of him and we begin to make love again. I feel his penis penetrate and I gasp in joy at the intense pleasure. We make love passionately. (175 words)

["I kill Howard."] I am in a room, nearly empty. Charla and I are packing to leave. On the floor are many magazine pictures cut out and each one laid out beside each other over most of the floor. I ask her to help me pack them. I show her how to do it so things are organized. I put the similar animal ones together. I show her three elephant pictures and put them together in a pile. As we are doing this, an odd looking spirit or ghost rushes in through the curtains. It comes at me. It has a round head like a balloon under a sheet. It is attacking so I defend myself, by trying to strangle it. It becomes Howard. I must kill it. I persist strangling it until he is dead. (133 words)

["Howard wants to own real estate with me."] I am sleeping sitting up on a couch. I am exhausted. Charla is up and wants me to get up. I can't seem to wake up. Howard sneaks in through the window. I am annoyed but too tired to do anything about it. Finally I get up. Howard says there is this great deal on buying a house. He thinks we could pool our money and buy it together. I glare and him and say "WE?" in a cold tone. He flushes bright red. I repeat the question. He gets the point and walks out reluctantly, angry and still red. (100 words)

["Flying in my truck because it would be fun."] I am working on a project. I am looking at the printed pages of the galley sheets of a book I am writing. I realize I need to ask some more questions of the newspaper office. I walk outside. I get into my green pickup truck and am driving down a city street. I look up in the sky and see an airplane and think it would be fun to fly in my truck. As I think it, I will it to fly. We go up above the buildings and fly across town. I am grinning in the pleasure of having that power and in actually flying. I choose not to fly too high up, in case something goes wrong. It's a bumpy landing. I gather up my papers and get out. I go into the newspaper office. No one is there. I walk toward the inner offices. A line of people come out, from their coffee break. One sees me and goes straight to the files to get my project. I say, no, this time I have a question I need to ask Ted, the owner. I look at the galley sheet and I can't remember the question. I apologize to the man and try to remember the question. Then I ask how much it will cost to print it. The man says this is a newspaper office. We only print the newspaper. I look up and see that "my dad" is here also. He has an artificial eye, a large blue one which he nearly takes out, yet he also sees me with it. He is very plump and short. At first, I think I see his chest hairs exposed with a tattoo. But I realize it is his arm. Now I leave to return to the truck. I wonder if "Dad" will be there so we can ride back together. He is. A young boy from the newspaper office is there visiting with a young boy accompanying me. He doesn't want to leave his friend. I say firmly, James, it's OK. I'll be back soon, probably many times. James feels OK then and leaves. A young boy is in my wheelchair and my "dad" is at the drivers wheel. I ask how will I get into the van. The boy then realizes he has to give me my wheelchair back and "dad" has to back up the van so I can get in the side door. "Dad" moves the van and I see a small toddler like Amelia out of the truck and playing near the wheel. It was a lucky escape she wasn't run over. (439 words)

["Dancing with a man."] I am in some public place, inside. Maybe a cafe. A nice man (like Gaston) and I are talking. Then he gently puts his arm around me and we begin to walk in a dance like step. It is going well, except somehow we clumsily bump our legs together on one of the steps. We do it each time. It almost throws us off balance but we still manage to dance, even though it isn't all fun, with a bit of tension around the ungainly step. It does feel nice to be close to a man. He gently kisses my cheek. (101 words)

["Ellie is a bad girl."] A man is driving a bus. He and I are the official chaperones for a group of teens. He has been driving many hours and I decide I want to drive, to help him out. So during a break, I get in the driver's side, which happens to be on the right side, like in England. Ellie decides she is going to drive and she sits very close to my on my left. It interferes with my driving and I try pushing her away from me. She clings on. I get annoyed. I keep shoving. Finally, I force her into the back of the bus. Now I drive. Later, I stop the bus so people can get out and take a break. I then see that Ellie has taken my photos outside and have tossed them into the air and they lay along side the road. I am furious and run out there to pick them up. The nice man comes over and picks up a black and white photo of me and another girl as children. He says nice picture. You're a good photographer. I had hoped he'd come by and see some pictures of me as a child and notice how cute I was. But he thought I had taken the photo. I am frustrated. I thank him for the complement and don't straighten him out. Now I am really angry at Ellie and I get on the bus and physically drag her out to force her to help pick up the mess. She just stands there. I grab her by the hair and pull her up to standing and I say to her that she has created a situation where people don't like her, for good reason. If she doesn't change she will spend her life being hated by these people and abandoned by them. I say to her she will have to work hard. She will have to clean up her mess and behave very well for a while before she has earned their respect and friendship. She doesn't seem interested. I grab the rest of the photos and get in the bus. Now, I am watching the scene as if from a high helicopter. I look down at the ground and see the people walking around. I see "me" and the man trying to get away alone together. We run toward a snow field. I don't want to get cold and wet, but I want to be alone with him. Later, I see "me" in the bathroom cooking hamburgers and hot-dogs on an open fire. Ellie comes in and drags me out. Josh comes by and is shocked and upset that the two chaperones are off trying to romantically get it on rather than be responsible chaperones for the teens. We might lose our jobs. (470 words)

["Walking on air."] I am outside a building with cement patios and stairs. Someone tries a new gadget, sort of a pogo stick that glides on air. They fall over immediately, because when they stepped they did it too fast and it flew the gadget right out from under them. I knew what they did wrong and got on the gadget to show them how to do it right. I take slow tiny steps and the gadget is very sensitive and I nearly lose it several times. Then I get the hang of it and am walking on air. I go up and down the stairs, which is dangerous and difficult. I manage it. A tall muscular man picks me up. He is my boyfriend and likes to walk around holding me on his hip as he goes around. It keeps us close and cuddly. I enjoy it too. He walks up the steps with me on his hip. We laugh and talk. He is very strong and relaxed. (166 words)

["Angry at Howard in a new house."] I am in a small two bedroom house. I am aware that Howard still lives with me and I wonder where's he been sleeping all this time. I guess he stays in what used to be Charla's bedroom. I remember it has been years since we've had sex. I am not interested in having sex with him. Now there is a 7 or 8 year old boy, and Charla at that age. We walk outside. The boy must be Howard's son. I am getting into a car and I see Charla fall over backwards, hitting her head badly. Howard is standing there right by her and hardly notices, much less doing anything that could help her. I am furious at him. I get out of the car and pick Charla up, soothing her. I examine the head wound and worry she might get a concussion. Now I sit in the backseat with the two children on my lap. We are talking, pleasantly. We drive to a house we are looking at to possibly move into. We have a real estate agent, a man, who is showing us what's in our price range which is roomy and spacious. We walk in and indeed there are lots of rooms, three stories, and the rooms are large. But the paint is peeling, the colors faded and ugly. The house is old and dilapidated. I realize I'd walked up several flights of stairs. I think maybe that will be too tiring to do all the time if I lived here. There would be lots of work to do. Then I think, why am I moving in with Howard? I don't want to. (278 words)

["Lost my dreams."] I have my briefcase. I am walking hurriedly down a hall to get to a classroom on time. I walk in and see that all the chairs in the back, by the door are full. I am disappointed. That's where I feel more comfortable sitting. Jerome is sitting in the back row. I decide to deal with what is and go to the front of the classroom to deposit my project. I am carrying a skull in my hand. I lay it on the long table at the front. I then go back to the seats and ask if the empty chair on the aisle is taken. A man says yes. A boy had been sitting there. So I put my briefcase on the third chair in and ask the man to watch it while I do an errand. He says fine. I walk down the hall and when I return I see the briefcase is gone. I ask people where it is and no one knows. I am very upset. My purse with my money and credit cards where there, but much worse, my notebook with my dreams written in it was there. I start crying. I walk out of the classroom to find the office where the lost and found is. I can't find it either. I am very upset and frustrated. It would be terrible to lose my dreams. Jerome watches. (234 words)

I see Lucy who has bought lots of property on this side of the block, which is the bad or lower priced part of the neighborhood. The places she bought are run down and dilapidated.

["Reading my class notes, not quite prepared."] I am in a journalism class, hurriedly looking through my notes for the kinds of examples my teacher is calling for. As students are reading their notes to the class, I hurriedly try to find some I made. I feel unprepared. The teacher is seated in a student desk just in front of me. He says sarcastically, Guess you're trying to write some on the spot. I say defensively no, just circling some examples. I go to the front of the class and pick up the microphone off its odd round stainless steel holder. It is heavy metal. A woman student says no, leave it in the stand. I say then can people hear me? I then notice how loud my voice is and say I guess t works. She gets up and sings a song with the mike to test it. I wait for her to finish the entire song. Now I start reading snippets of my notes. The teacher wants personal remarks about the facts we were getting about a story. So I read a few phrases I wrote about a story the teacher used as an example about a person with a disability and how the problem is people getting all weirded out about their disability. I comment it is hard to counsel disabled people who are treated that way. Then I say next is some doodled pictures of dishes, like they are stacked up to be washed. Stainless steel mixing bowls and colored plastic small bowls. I say I don't know why I doodled dishes, but sometimes when I am thinking, I doodle. Then a remark about my father and I doing some activity. A few notes on Mirabelle and working with clients. She has some names and phone numbers for me. The teacher is impressed as I go along. I had lots, even though I wasn't prepared and my stuff is a bit poetic and interesting, not like the shallow stuff the younger students are doing. (331 words)

I am not married and if I didn't have the affair with him, he'd simply go get another woman. I am not breaking up their marriage. I'm not interested in having more of a relationship with him. I call my veterinarian for more pills for the cats. I then decide Bill could be helped with these pills. I am trying to get more for him. Then we get in a convertible, red car to drive somewhere. He is driving. I say quick, get in that middle lane. It's a freeway and we are on an entrance ramp. He makes the car leap over one lane to get there. I realize we left so quickly I forgot to pack. I left behind my pills and Bill's pills. Now we are out of the car, in a public parking garage, and walking down many steps. I suddenly realize we are going out together in public and this will cause a media frenzy. I stop and say Wait. Are you sure we should do this? He smiles and continues forward. I stop and watch. A very tall security person comes to Bill. Bill looks very short compared to him. Abnormally short. He is being escorted away, maybe even arrested. I turn and quickly go back the way we came. The police and the media are in hot pursuit. I am going against the walking traffic. I bump into people. I get to a cafe and sit. The waitress is very upset because she doesn't make much money. I offer to let them move to my town and live with me for awhile until they get a new job and get financially more secure. They hesitate and think about it. (320 words)

["Escaping disguised as the enemy."] Charla and I and some friends are attempting to escape from the enemy. We get out of the building and sneak around the landscape. We are near an ocean. We see some of the enemy in their black wet suits with yellow balloon like helmets that also cover their faces. I am standing next to the barracks of the enemy. One of them is sleeping in his room. Somehow he comes out and decides to help us escape. He gets us the same black wet suits and yellow helmets. We put them on and walk right through the outside compound of enemy. We walk into the ocean and dive, I hang onto Charla's rope and I am hanging on to the enemies rope as he guides us through the completely dark black waters. We are avoiding the underhulls of huge ships and trying to stay in the right direction. I feel lost and scared. We must rely on the enemy's help. He does right by us and we end up on another shore. Now we are housed in a large room. Each group has a tiny area. We are like refugees. Next to our area is a man. I think we are attracted to each other but I can't tell for sure. We avoid eye contact and act cool around each other, but we are very aware of where the other one is. I decide to go to the "underground" store. I sneak around the streets back toward the water. I find the cardboard cutout of a soldier. That is the sign. I ask for some colors. I meant colored yarn I can make things with. I get one skein. Return to the barracks. Bonnie comes in with a container of food. She offers me one of the green beans. I ask if it is snap peas. I take one of the green beans, although they are old and a bit moldy. We don't have much food and that is a generous offer of Bonnie's. I have a container of food also and show her. Some white stuff, maybe potatoes and some Chinese concoction. Now I return to our small area, next to the man. I ignore him pointedly. I decide to be daring and hang up a key of mine on a hook up on the ceiling. Then a pretty and slightly sexy nighty, then another piece of clothing to cover it up. People are watching and thinking how brave of me to put my belongings out there where people can steal them. They then also start to do that too. Then the man comes over and grabs me. We play wrestle, both pretending to be angry at each other, but it is just an excuse to be touching. (460 words)

She is in a shower, trying to shampoo and he is naked, trying to tease her as he is in the shower also. She just smiles and ignores his antics. He would like to be sexual with her. His penis playfully touches her and she continues to ignore him. He's an OK guy but she knows he's only playing and she doesn't intend to have a relationship with him. It is all pleasant and not rejecting. (133 words)

["Hospital rooms and irregular fast heart beat."] I am walking through a series of Hospital rooms. Each room has a bed and a patient and a front door to the right. I am using connecting doors the medical personnel use. I feel strange using this door and am relieved I am carrying a stethoscope so I wouldn't get caught. I see a front door opened in a room with no patient. I run through to the hall. Now, a fire alarm goes off, loud and insistent. I am running. I feel out of breath and the beginnings of my irregular heart beat begins. But I have to keep running. My heart is beating very fast. Now the building is like a dorm. I rush out the building and see remodeling like its been bombed out. I notice the room numbers and realize I am several units/buildings away from my own dorm room. I keep running. (148 words)

["Supervising counselors should have more experience."] I am at some workshops for counselors. I am listening. After it is finished, a woman comes over to me with a piece of paper with her suggestions on it. I read it. Next time, she would like to see some information on having supervisors have more experience than the ones they supervise. Then she has other things. I comment that this wasn't the topic area we were doing. She's more into how to improve teaching counselors and the workshop was on better counseling. The last line was a series of colors mostly mauve and purple except one aqua blue. (100 words)

["Inaccessibility not an issue when not needed."] I am at a workshop Lucy is putting on. She tells the audience to all join her in some small square at the top of the raised seats in the auditorium. Everyone goes up there. It is very crowded. I stay below at an aisle landing and watch. I tell some woman in a wheelchair, like Arvonne, this is terrible to have this inaccessible experience when it is presented by people with disabilities. As I sit there and watch, I realize that if I really wanted to, I could get there and join them if I wanted to. I realize I just don't want to and I let go of my complaints. I tell Lucy she did a good job on the workshop. (123 words)

["Raging bull after me."] I am standing in front of a stonewall. On the other side, I see a raging bull ready to charge at me. I don't know what to do. I can't out run him. I don't know if he will smash through the wall or leap over it. I decide to crouch up to the wall, hoping he leaps over. If he doesn't I will be dead. He is a huge bull with long horns. He does leap over and I scramble over the wall to the side he was on. He turns to come for me, again. I climb up a pole which is holding up the barn roof. He is leaping up at me, trying to get me. I am hanging on for dear life. He almost reaches me. I crawl up on the roof and lie there as he batters at the pole. I slide backwards toward the middle pole seeing he is about to destroy the first one and I and the roof will fall. As he breaks it, I keep moving back. I then am watching the scene. I see a woman and 2 kids climb up some stone steps at the other end of the barn. There is a way off the roof. Now I am climbing down the steps. (215 words)

["Wheelchair racing."] I am watching wheelchair racers on some odd bumpy curvy uphill, down hill race course, which isn't a round track but some sort of street area. They seem tiny and fast. One of them is a paraplegic man. He is very good. Now he rests and my job is to help him. Giving massages and so on. I am doing that. Then another man comes by, someone I know in the dream, and we kiss. This makes the paraplegic man jealous, as he is attracted to me. Then I decide to be a wheelchair racer as well, although I am able bodied. We are racing. He is very fast and far ahead of me. I work very hard and manage to pass some other racers. On big man glares at me. I try to catch up with my man. I manage to finish 3rd which is still very good for my first try. I shout in victory and cry in defeat alternating. The man and I hug in jubilation. (169 words)

["I am the alien."] My three sisters and I are watching it snow. We are standing by a road. Suddenly, a gas trailer truck comes quickly down the road and can't slow down enough for the T-intersection. It crashes into the embankment. It keeps going fast, like it is afraid and running away from something. I look down the road it came from and realize that the aliens are coming. We run, following the gas truck. Now I realize the aliens take over bodies and I don't know which person may already be an alien. I am seated now at a table in a restaurant, and a man is seated with us. I look at him suspiciously. He is looking at me suspiciously and I suddenly realize I am the alien. He recognizes that and grabs me. He saws off my head and puts my head back on and I am reclaimed. I half sit up on the floor, dazed by the ordeal of the surgery. (162 words)

["Weird bathroom again."] I am on some kind of journey. I need to pee badly. I walk down a hill, following some man, possibly black. I step down onto a cement platform covered thigh deep in snow. I pass a toilet, white with black toilet seat, hanging on a chain. I decide I'll keep looking. I am in snow up to my thighs. I wade through. Now the snow is merely a skiff on the ground. The toilet is a rectangle metal grid with a slot in the center on the cement platform. I stand over the slot, commenting I shall try and pee standing up. A rush of urine comes out and for the most part is going into the slot. But toward the end, it starts to dribble down my leg. I shift position, trying to not get it on me. (140 words)

["Howard has a girlfriend."] Howard and I are in a park. He still wants us to get together again. I don't want to. I am packing my things in a back pack. Some of Dovre's things go in there too. She left them behind. Then his "mother" starts talking about a girlfriend he might go see. I feel a little jealous. I know she doesn't want us to get together. She doesn't like me. Conflicting feelings. I don't want him but I don't want someone else to have him. Then he tells me someone has parked in the Deputy Provost's spot. He wants me to report it. I walk toward the building to do so. Then a man comes toward me. I suspect it is the one who illegally parked and I turn and walk across the field. He follows. I then see an old fashioned black telephone on the grass. It is near where the bad man is. I bravely, but with fear, walk up to the phone to report him and then walk away hoping he doesn't hurt me. He looks at me menacingly but doesn't come after me. (187 words)

["Ashes, ashes, we all fall down."] I am in a house. I suddenly notice that the sky is black as if it were night, but it is still daylight. I am concerned. What is happening? I look out the window to get a better view. Now I see black snow like things falling down from the sky. I wonder if they are ashes from a fire, or toxic poisonous stuff. I go into another room and am organizing things. I see index cards I can use to write notes on. (84 words)

["Camping and relationships."] I am in a car. I am in the front seat, and a woman is in the back. I think it is a station wagon. I look at her and an sexually excited. We are going to have a relationship. She is fixing herself up and fixing the upholstery of the car seat. I am lying down and I feel an orgasm. I press my legs together to encourage it, hoping she won't see or hear. She doesn't notice. Then three men appear at the window. One is my boyfriend, the other two are his friends. He is upset and jealous. He gets in the seat with me and our faces are very close. I kiss him on the cheek, and say, we have to talk. He knows that means its over for him. He sadly gets out of the car. The two friends are disgusted with me, for choosing the woman. They leave. Then I look in the back seat. She is lying down trying to look inviting. Charla comes to the window and wants to come in. I open the door for her. The woman is upset and doesn't want her in the car because she will mess up the lovely back seat she had fixed up. I am angry at her and say to her to shut up! I tell Charla to wait for me outside. I then tell the woman it is not OK to reject Charla. I tell her I don't like her hair do and I don't like the way she fixed up the back seat. I see wrinkled bunched up grey upholstery. She is sad and disappointed and gets out of the car. I feel relieved and free now. I put on lipstick. It is shiny and glossy. I notice my lips are thinned out from age, but I put the lipstick on more thickly to make my lips look more full. I enjoy this process. Now I drive the car a few feet away from the tent the woman and I were going to share and stop at the tent Charla and I will share. A man (Wilbur) is all bound up in a sleeping bag near the tent. I carefully backup so that I don't hurt him. I get out and look around for a place to safely store my wallet and car key. I find a messy used skillet from breakfast and put them with it. I put it in an end table and change my mind and put it in a mattress that has a zippered cover. I know they are obvious places a thief would look, but I decide it will be safe. (445 words)

I approach her, very happy to have her back. We are on a journey. Walking down hall after hall. We are looking for a restaurant. It seems that my "mother" is actually a man who loves me and he wishes to declare himself. In an appropriate place. We climb laboriously up ladders and get to a top floor to find out the restaurant is closed. I am upset and afraid of going back down. The man "mother" assists me down by a platform like elevator. We go quickly. Then we walk down more halls and find a woman in a shop. We ask her where another restaurant is because the one named "Legacy" was closed. She points down the street and says it is called "Treasure." We go outside and are not walking on the side of an Interstate freeway. Cars are coming at us and we move to get a safer path. We are approaching a bridge that crosses the California border. (202 words)

["Weird eyes in trouble."] I am in a room. It is dark. Ellie comes in and I want her to replace the two broken or burnt out light bulbs. Then she brings a bucket full of water for my tired achy feet. I notice that the water in the bucket recedes and returns, like a tide. Not only that, but the floor of the room is a foot under water and that water recedes and returns as well. I am concerned this will cause damage from the water. Ellie isn't too concerned. (88 words)

["Counseling the man."] I am counseling a woman who is very unhappy. Her husband is distant and uncaring. She has a miserable life, emotionally, although he's a good provider. I listen to her and then decide to talk with the husband. I go outside to the garden he is working in. I say to him very forthrightly I want 10 minutes of your time to talk about your relationship. I resolve to time myself carefully and be done in nine minutes. I just flat out lay it out for him, figuring he won't take the time to listen and think things through. I say you made her chose between the two things she loves the most. You and Germany. You said if she was to be with him she had to move to his farm and never return to Germany. She did that. And now you remain distant and isolated in your garden. She is very unhappy, but she does as you command. She will die soon at an early age if you continue to deny her emotional connection and autonomy. It will be your fault. He is startled at what I said to him. I look at my watch and see it has been eight minutes. I stop abruptly and say Thanks for your time. Goodbye. I walk out to the car and drive away, but I sense I have made a difference and have somehow cut through his stubborn denial. There is hope for her. (244 words)

["Magnetic building."] I am in an old house. My mother and my father are around, other relatives and Aunt Marianne. I see on the floor small cute miniatures lined up. They nearly cover all the floor space. I start picking some up to get them out of harm's way since the relatives keep walking in and out of the house. I go to the door and look out across the deep canyon to the huge mansion across the way. I watch as a huge platform part of the roof opens up and the house turns like on a turntable. I am amazed. Aunt Marianne is behind me also watching. Then I feel a magnetic force pulling at my body. I struggle to remain where I am, but it increases in strength until I and then Marianne are pulled right off our porch and fly across the canyon and are deposited in the top floor of this mansion. Some clerk type person, very bored is there. I ask them where are we. He doesn't respond but pushes a lever and a door opens and we are propelled inside a tiny room like an elevator. Lovely wood paneling and floor. The elevator room moves down and opens. We walk out. (206 words)

["Sebastian dies."] I am in some large motel room lying on a couch. I am grieving deeply because Nate has died. A woman stands nearby to help me if I need it. I gaze around the room and wonder why I have paid for such a large room, since I simply use the couch. I then remember all accessible rooms are the large ones. Too bad. A waste of money and space. I realize I shall have to deal with Sebastian's wife and feel embarrassed or guilty. An unpleasant but inevitable duty. She will be upset I had an affair with Sebastian. I continue feeling overwhelmed with grief. (106 words)

A part of me hopes we aren't being so noisy that we wake the kids in the next room, but the desire is intense and we make wild passionate love. I am all over him, moving toward that climax. It feels great. Then I have orgasm. His hair is soft. I feel good about him and loved the sex. (91 words)

["Not doing it by the book."] Two men and I are in an empty room. One man is proposing to me. He hands me a booklet I am supposed to take and fill out properly to answer him. It's like a tax return booklet. I think this is ridiculous because I already know my answer which is no. What a waste of my time. I decide to just answer him directly and now to avoid wasting time and emotions. I say to him. I don't want to marry you. He is very upset with me for not taking the time and doing it right.

["Practicing the blues harp."] I am organizing things at a desk. I look in a drawer for my blues harp. I want to learn how to play it. I find many new black plastic ones that are real cheap. I pull them out. I am apparently redoing a list on a typewriter. I then find my old metal harp, without its cover, all banged up. But the sound is still good. I decide to practice on that one. I feel overwhelmed by the amount of things I would have to learn to be good at this. Mouth position, hand position and how to breath, but decide not to worry about it and just play it. I am walking now outdoors and I am a beautiful teenage girl. I am wearing a very sophisticated tailored navy blue suit, with white trim and look very good and professional. I sit down on a bench and play the harp, improving as I play. My eyes are closed as I concentrate on the music which keeps getting better. A crowd gathers around me of appreciative people, many young men, who are attracted to me. I suddenly open my eyes and am startled to find this crowd. I walk away looking for wilderness where nobody is to be able to play uninterrupted. I find a tree in the woods and sit there playing beautiful blues harp music. Later I go home. I am looking forward to telling my "father" a sort of Clint Eastwood kind of guy, being home and telling him all about my day. A young man named Perry from school is very attracted to me but I don't seem to notice him or anyone for that matter. I begin to tell my "father" about the day but he interrupts looking at the dining table. I hurriedly go there with a sponge to clean up any mess that might annoy him. He comes over and I try to continue telling him my day. He points to this spot or that and soon the whole energy is finding spots of dried food on the table and scrubbing at them to wash them off. I am frustrated. I wipe off spilled sugar onto the floor. Now I the dreamer is looking at the young teen girl as her father might see her. Her prim and sophisticated suit is unbuttoned at the top and the bra is revealed. She looks sexy. This upsets the father. Then the phone rings and a woman, sort of a housekeeper, answers and calls the girl to the phone. "Its for you." She says. The girl is very surprised. No one calls her. It is Perry on the phone to ask her out for a date. The father is upset and concerned about his daughters growing up into a woman. After the call, the housekeeper (now me) watches as the two try to continue their conversation. The father looks over to me with a questioning look and I shake my head no. He has said or done the wrong thing. Then I say to him, here I'll talk with her and you watch. Now the teen girl is a TV set on the table. I look at it and as she speaks, I listen sympathetically, sometimes paraphrasing her feelings. Especially in the places where the father would lose it and lecture or be negative. He is starting to catch on. (565 words)

["Improv party at the school."] I am a new teacher at a school and am shown to my office. I look around and see some things left by the previous teacher. I am organizing my material. I am trying to grind up some small rocks in a small square container. It won't grind them. I repeatedly take them out, look at them, and then try again. Finally I understand that the battery is dead. I decide to go to the school supply office. It is right next door, conveniently. I go in there. The two secretaries are busy. It is a regular admissions office, but there are gift like items for sale. Red glass vases, filmy scarves, hair things, and Christmas decorations. I am waiting and looking around. Sarafina comes over and I hand her my pile of things, requesting a return of some films, a new battery and a few other things I came for. Some other teachers come in and now its a party. Entertainment and jokes as I watch the room fill up all around me. A woman is doing her skit and I decide to join in the fun. I sit on the secretary (Sarafina's) chair and I touch her desk, from behind the counter. Everyone is shocked and the woman is very upset with me. I say opps. I made a mistake. Sarafina will be furious. Then I see a silly act at the door. William Shatner and someone else is outside the door and a tiny baby elephant is placed on the open transom. The door opens and I see William and the woman piled one on top of the other and they look up and see the baby elephant step down on William's back. They made silly faces as they all crunch down flat on the ground and roll into the room. I am in the corner by the door on the floor watching and I get all mixed up with them. William and the woman get up and walk away and the baby elephant rolls off me and I get up. It was very funny. Now the party is raucous and out of control. I leave and go back to my office, everyone is mad at me and as I open the office door I see they are in my room. I feel invaded and upset because they don't like me. The snotty woman is there who is mad at me. I tiredly explain to her that what I did helped them. The party had been boring. Not because it wasn't good, I hasten to reassure her, but because it had been done many times. It wasn't new. I improv'd and the energy opened up and now everyone had more fun. They started realizing I was right. Now they are beginning to like me. (467 words)

["Strange charming man."] I am watching two black men in bed together. One is Bill Cosby. The other man is some charming man that is friendly. In his exuberance of friendliness, he is kissing Bill Cosby on his lips and cheek as he excitedly is talking about some interesting subject. Bill slowly becomes uncomfortable with this intimacy which seems more than just friendship. But he likes the man as a friend. Finally, Bill pulls away, uncertain of what is really happening. I feel uncomfortable about it too. It seems that the gestures are sexual in implications, beyond just friendship. Now Bill's wife is in another room. The charming man is with her and being effusively friendly with her as well, although they are not kissing. She is worried that this warmth may exceed friendly bounds and become an affair, which would be bad for her marriage. A white grandmother is also watching and she is starting to catch on that the wife and this charming man are having an affair. A top freezer compartment of a refrigerator is opened. Bill finds opened photo albums in there. He pulls them out to see the pictures that the charming man and the wife were looking at. A photo of the wife in her bridal gown. And other photos. He is also beginning to catch on that they had been looking at these photos together. (229 words)

["Odd woman is hungry."] I live in a huge old country house with a gravel turn around driveway. I am tired. I suddenly remember that I hadn't locked the front door last night. I check. It is unlocked. I lock it. Commenting to a young Arvonne like woman who also lives in the house that I should be more careful. I am hungry and want to eat but lots of the dishes are dirty. Fry pans from cooking scrambled eggs and bacon and so on. I had been trying on clothes. Some summer dresses. A personal assistant like Sharon also lives in the house. I am a bit annoyed because there is work to do but they aren't too interested in helping me do it. So I walk toward the sink to wash dishes. As I pass near the door, I see a maroon station wagon drive into the driveway. A woman is in the car. Looks like she is turning around in our driveway. Then suddenly she walks into the house uninvited. I am surprised. She is chatting in a crazy way. She sees a bit of bacon stuck to a cloth on the counter and quickly grabs it as she is talking non stop and eats it. I realize she is homeless and hungry. I say oh well, why don't you stay for dinner. I have plates of pancakes, porkchops, and lots of other food on the table. She asks me who lives her. I point out the 2 women and say also my granddaughter, Charla. She sits and grabs up lots of food in a very hungry way and is scarfing the food down as she talks. Someone asks her how she's doing. She tells the story of owning a store and everything was fine until the male city council caught a fish and came home early and passed a law changing where the alley is, which wiped out her business. I say it will be dark soon. Shall we light candles or turn on the lights. Sharon says lets turn on the overhead lights. I say I was thinking of the light above the table, for pretty effect. Just then, a single line of maybe 30 or more girls about the age of 10 walk in and are filing around the edge of the room. (385 words)

["Kitten must clean up the mess."] My "sister" and I live in a house beside a hill. Male workers are up on the top of the hill are moving dirt and some of it is rolling down the hill onto our property. One of the workers is supposed to come down and help clean up the mess. We wait, but he is taking too long. So my sister and I go up a rickety flight of stairs up the hill. She goes first and I follow. The second flight of stairs now becomes a thin narrow metal and that we cling to with fingers. It is scary and difficult. But we succeed. We go into the building they live and work from. We ask for Paolo. They say he is out and will return soon. They lead us to his room. I see his big comfortable double bed with colorful quilts on it. I lie down on the bed and look around to see what this man might be like. He has a TV that is sort of a journal he keeps. I look at it with interest, like of liking the man before I meet him. Then he comes in, a big comfortable man. He walks over to the bed and I look up. He has a translucent white mime mask on with odd big blue eyes. I find that interesting. Then my "sister" rushes for him and kisses him. I am angry at her because I am attracted to him, and she always gets things first. I stand up and walk over to the window and look out trying to ignore them kissing. He takes off his mask and tries to follow me. I see a small boy/kitten who throws a balled up piece of paper on the floor. Paolo reaches down to pick it up, to be kind and helpful. I stop him, saying no, the boy has to learn to do it himself. He made the mess. The boy, now a kitten refuses to pick up his mess. I pick him up in my hands and place him right next to the paper. He resists picking it up. Paolo really wants to help. He has a generous heart. I explain that that is really not helping. It teaches the boy bad habits. Then finally the boy/kitten picks up the paper and I praise him and let him go. Now Paolo is approaching me. He is attracted to me and wants to connect. But I decide I must run a race first. I put on sneakers and begin running the race. Paolo follows hoping to catch me. I am attracted to him, but I must run this race first. I run. And he follows. (451 words)

["Working the dream in the dream."] I am in a house at night. I am trying to turn off the lights in an alcove, so I can peek out the window and see what's going on out there. I'm on the second story. The light won't turn off and I don't want to be exposed when I peek out. I try to look anyway, but can't see much. I had had a dream and I am excited about it. I want to write it down. It's an important one that explains what I need to know. So I am reading a book with many short chapters. One is entitled "Propositions." One is written by Rosie McDonnell. It's a sweet children's story of a dragon and a collie dog. I see pages of color illustration of the collie lost in the woods with his cute ears perked up listening for the dragon. It's a fairy tale dragon in the pictures. But now I'm in the story and I know the dragon is going to eat me. That's not such a pretty picture I feel fear. Now I am in my wheelchair going to a store. Anastasia is with me. I need to write the dream and I also need to read these articles in a newspaper put out by Julie Osborne about dreams. I fold the paper and find the pages with the articles but my eye is caught by cartoons. One is entitled, "Two Old Queens." Two women in 19th century dress, young and pretty. I don't get the joke. I find the articles and excited, I begin to read, but interrupt myself to write my dream down. I struggle to dig out the dream book from a bag on the back of my wheelchair. Then Anastasia goes into the store and a biker parks next to me singing a sad tale of his wife Lisa leaving him. I listen as I write my dream down. And apologize to his little girl. (326 words)

He has a male friend who helps him. We are watching some movie, maybe a WWII movie. Clark sees me and falls deeply in love. He stares at me continuously. I try to concentrate on the movie. I can feel his deep need and love. I am attracted to him as well, but I sit waiting. The other man comes over to my table and talks with me. He is watching our courtship intently. The black maid he is in love with comes in. She sits at our table. He is now intently watching her. Clark says something, a joke to attract my attention. I walk over to him and put my arms on his shoulders standing very close to him as we joke back and forth talking nothings while the body contact and wistfullness is acted out as we become physically closer and closer. Now the black maid rebuffs the friend. He is devastated. I tell Clark that his friend needs him. Clark is desperately trying to pull out of his drunken state and behave well. He can barely notice his friend's plight because of his own struggles and high concentration on his love for me. I am sympathetic to the man and to Clark. (236 words)

["Rejecting a friendly truth."] I am ill and lying on a couch with my wheelchair next to it. A good looking man comes in and sits in my wheelchair. I am attempting to straighten out some books and writing projects piled up on the couch all around me. He wants to help. He is attracted to me and living. I am annoyed with him for sitting in my wheelchair and for wanting to help. I can do this myself. Was my feelings. He smiles and patiently waits. That annoys me even more. I am abrupt and upset with him and also attracted and wanting some help. He will remain until I finally figure it out and let him in. (115 words)

["Helping Mirabelle."] Mirabelle gave me a big cardboard box of fruits. Blackberries, bananas, raspberries. Another box had several large zucchini squashes. I decide to make jams and jellies from the fruits. I am smashing the fruits into a pulp. The cardboard box is ripped and some of the juices are soaking out of the box. I manage to make three or four jars of jam. The last one is more of a jelly. (I am concerned that slightly muddy water got into the jelly. Now I need to add the paraffin on top and do the lids. Later, I am at a big farm, near a storage shed. The big house is back off in the distance. Mirabelle and Dwan are off doing errands and I am going through a cardboard box reading and organizing the paperwork in there for Mirabelle. I feel good about helping her out. But I am getting tired. I've been at it for several hours. I now have a handful of small stubs of receipts and am transferring the money spent amount to a yellow ledger sheet pad. It is confusing which one was for coffee and which ones for dinners and lunches. I try my best to record them accurately. Now I see Mirabelle, off in the distance returning home in their car. Dwan gets on a motorcycle which at first looked like a tractor and motors over to see how I'm doing. The motor is very noisy. I am so tired I can hardly keep my eyes open. I see Mirabelle at the house with a small child she brought home to take care of while its parent is busy. She does this a lot. Dwan and another child are with me. She is eyeing me like she is interested in my body, but I am aware it's just a habit with her. I hear really loud music coming from a radio off in the neighbors field. It is very annoying and I want them to turn it off. I pick up a wind bottle, empty, from the box and try to find a price on it to record. I can't see one at all. I ask Dwan to check it out as well. She can't find one either. (374 words)

["Marching as to war."] I am in a classroom of adults. We are studying a play. The young woman who wrote the play is across the room. She asks me if a character in her play is named similar to the title, which is "And Sun Comes" I think about it, wondering if there was a character named summer. But I decide it is a trick question and no characters were named after the title. Suddenly we must go to war. We file out of the classroom. A woman friend and I pack up a suitcase and then decide it is too much to carry and leave it, with the intent of picking it up later. We march down a road. After a long time, we stop. I wonder if we should return and get the suitcase before we get so far away we can't. We realize it is already too far. It would be ridiculous to return to the suitcase and then do the journey again. We march on. We come to a University. I steal a roll of toilet paper and put it in my backpack. We will have to survive on what we find. I hope no one catches us. (199 words)

["Odd quad."] I walk into a room where there are hundreds of knick knacks that used to be mine and the children's. I walk around the room looking closely at them. They are cute miniature toys and figurines. I see a pile of old black and white photos on a table and pick one up. It is a head and shoulders shot of both myself and Rochelle when we were younger, maybe in our 30's. As I look, the photo moves, my double chin flapping as I move and talk. I think to myself that I was much thinner then. There is distance between Rochelle and I. She is looking away from me so that we are both facing the same direction. I then sit down on a couch. A male quad wheels into the room. He comes over and parks on my right, at the end of the couch. We are introduced by a woman. He curves his very long arm out across the room and then back toward me to shake my hand. I am amazed at the long reach he has. I shake his hand but he doesn't remove it or stop shaking it. So We sit there holding hands in a shake hands position, rather raised in the air. We chat. The woman then helpfully leans forward, pushing our hands to gently break the clasp. I am relieved and we continue chatting. I need to go to the bathroom so I get up and walk down a hall. I ask one of my children if the room on the left is the bathroom. She says it is. I go in and try to secure the other door. It is ajar. I see through the crack and recognize a hall and many rooms off of it. I finally get the door to shut and sit on the toilet. I have a green colored BM. It is messy. I try to wipe clean, but it is sticky and I have trouble doing it. (333 words)

["Asking for information about dreams from a well-known author of books about dreams."] I am in a hotel room. I had picked up some special odd looking pictures I wanted to make. I now look more closely at them and see that it is a rectangular picture frame with a needlepoint canvas stretched on it. A saying is already worked on the canvas in orange yarn. The frame and canvas is then enclosed in a mess like cloth. I decide I made a mistake. Maybe I'll take the mess off and rework my own picture of a dream on this canvas. But the saying is in the way. I would have to undo her work (the author's) to do mine. Seems a lot of work. Now I am reading the manual of instructions with it. I see some new categories she has added to her usual list. I read them and think how odd. They seem minor and trivial, not helpful to the dreamer. Maybe just stuff that's in her dreams. Then I see her walking down the hall and I call out to her. I try to be friendly and non pushy but am a bit apprehensive she will snub me because of our previous encounters. She is friendly however and I politely say I have some questions about her dreamwork books, two of which I bought. I ask hr the questions and she responses with some general answer. (227 words)

I see a car with a mural of the mountains on the side windows and a mural of the coast on the front windshield. Ginny wants to go to the mountains and Ernie wants to go to the coast. The feeling is that Ernie figures he will have to go to the mountains because Ginny wants that. He misses the ocean and is wishful of going there. (81 words)

["Dressing for success."] I am in a room. Nate is there. I want to hug him. He starts to bend down, but I say wait. I want to hug him standing up. I struggle a bit and stand up. We have an awkward hug. Now it is time to go to a meeting. Maybe it is a job interview. I am walking, wearing a peach colored pretty business suit with white trim. I feel unsure if I should be now in my wheelchair or walking. I also can't decide if I should button up my jacket or not. I get out of the elevator in a back hall of the office. I realize I have an opportunity to sneak down the hall and check out info on how the business operates and I'd do better at the interview if I snuck a peek. I feel guilty but do sneak down the hall and then decide to be honest. I return to the main reception area which I enter from the back door. I maneuver around lots of desks and barriers and finally make it to the front of the front desk to announce myself. (191 words)

["Man eating alien plant."] I am in a possible space ship. We are growing plants. I discover alien plants among the regular plants. I am feeding them things that look like Brussels sprouts. I am explaining to someone that you have to be very careful feeding this plant because we already lost one crew member. He was sticking his hand with the food into the plant's top and the plant grabbed him and ate him. (71 words)

["Deciding to live."] My parents have decided that I should die now because things are so hard for me with all the suffering I have had and will have all my life. I have agreed. They decide the best way for me to die is to lie me down in a large rectangular box half filled with a metallic silvery liquid like molding metals for statues. I am supposed to lie down and they then bill the box up all the way and I would be totally covered and submerged. I would drown in this liquid and be preserved like a statue. The thought of the liquid entering my lungs is not a good one. I feel squeamish and afraid. Charla is sad I will die. Then I walk out of the room with the box and see my mother, my father, brother Dwight and Charla in a dining room. I join them, saying to Charla. I have decided not to die. I guess I'll just wait until I die of Arthritis whenever it happens. Charla is happy and relieved. I am very relieved also. I can't imagine what I was thinking to even have agreed to this unnecessary suicide plan. (198 words)

["Storms on the horizon."] I am outdoors with Henry. He is looking behind me and comments on the many tornado funnel storms he sees on the horizon approaching us. I am looking behind him and say there are over five of them just below the horizon. You can't see them now. I am worried and fearful for the people caught out in the open when the storms arrive. The winds kick up. An object that looks like a string green bean lands on my arm with a slap. It sticks on my right arm and begins the damaging process. It is like a leech. Henry's wife grabs at it and pulls it off. It leaves a red open wound. She is relieved it was taken off quickly enough so that only minimal damage was done. She had saved my life. I begin to become sleepy and fall onto a bed (perhaps I was carried into the house.) Henry is seated next to me. As I become unconscious he pulls me up to him in a tender hug. I am healing and now that I am unconscious am relaxed about him holding me. I am peacefully allowing the embrace to be positive and healing. (199 words)

["Traveling to France."] A man and I are walking hurriedly down a corridor to find the right plane to go to France. I see a shop on the left and read a price tag that says 2,000 something. I try to pronounce it in French. I have trouble remembering what the right words are but I do finally remember. We find a plane but are told it is the wrong one. We rush back down the corridor and find a second plane. I walk quickly up the stairs. We just as quickly walk back down as it is also the wrong plane. Now we are running to find a smaller plane. I realize I have to go to the bathroom. I look for one on the way and don't find one. I see a counter on the right and we ask directions of the woman there. Then I see an empty beauty parlor on the left. Cute plastic molded cubicles for the client and the hairdresser to be in like basket chairs hung from the ceiling. Then we find the area of boarding a cute little two seater train. Or at least the facade of a train on the back side and two seats like on a train open on the other side. It travels on the curved tracks. I really have to pee and hope there is a bathroom on the plane, wherever it is, and I hope it isn't too small. (240 words)

["Conflicted arthritis."] I am laying on my stomach on a hospital gurney in the hall. I am being prepared for surgery. I already am very drowsy with the anesthesia. A doctor comes over to my right and bends down to look at me. I work hard to speak clearly and remember all I need to tell him. He asks me what I have. I say Rheumatoid Arthritis. He asks what medications I am on. I say Risperdal and Cortisone. He asks me what surgery I am having. I tell him It is for conflicted arthritis. They need to open spots on my body to release something so I can get better. He is disapproving and surprised. He says I should be trying different medicines like a liquid form of what I take first to see if it will help. The surgery is drastic. I feel concerned that I've again made a mistake with my decisions and have rushed the process to an unnecessary risk taking procedure. I am angry at myself. I then decide that it will be fine. I need this surgery. I feel a nurse injecting more anesthesia meds in my right butt. I am nearly asleep. Another nurse, a man, pokes my right arm with a needle. I am angry at him. because he doesn't seem to have any reason for poking me. I muster up all the strength I have to glare at him. He comes back to do it again. I ask him what he is doing and then I realize he is supposed to be doing that, so I apologize and let him do it. I am afraid they will start the surgery before I am properly "out." I tell them I am still awake. I feel a slit being cut across the back just below the neck. It doesn't hurt. It has begun. (308 words)

["Arthritic concert."] I am going to a concert. The auditorium is just now opened and I hurriedly walk to the seats. As I approach the good seats right up front I see them filling up. I go to the next level and the same thing. I ask a woman if those seats are saved. She is rude and says they are. I keep going up, disappointed that I won't see as well. I climb a ladder, chatting with a young man about the crowded conditions and so on. I find a balcony area where some stools are. I grab one concerned I will be uncomfortable with no back rest, but at least I can see. I choose to lean against the wall, but then a row of people sit in front of me at the rail and I can barely see the music group down on the stage. A man with grey hair and a limp sits in front of me. I catch his eye and we smile. I look away and then back at him and we smile again. I see he has arthritis also. A deformed foot and so on. We feel a bond. We are attracted to each other. I decide to scoot forward and am now sitting right next to him, with one person sort of leaning in between us. The door opens on our right and we see close up two members of the group entering singing. They remind me a bit of the Star Spangled Band singer I spoke with. The concert has begun and I am excited. It is fun. (265 words)

["Tornadoes approaching."] I married a man with a number of brothers. I live in my house and he and his brothers live in the house next door. I walk over there to find him. I see that their father has cleared several paths through the bushes to make it easier to go back and forth. I thank him for doing that. Suddenly I am aware of high winds and turn and see in the distance, behind my house a tornado or two. I go into my house and am worried for the children. They are outside in the back. I open the door. By now the winds are ferocious. I call to the children, fear in my voice. They hear me but are slow to respond. I demand they come in the house right now! As I am herding them toward the house, the tornado approaches very close. I get them in and Ellie tries to follow me back out. I yell at her, Ellie! Over and over. Finally I get them and me inside. I say stay in the kitchen because it only has one small window. I say I wish we had a basement! I am scared we will be hurt. Now the tornado is very close at the far left of the house. I looks like it might pass us by. Then suddenly it turns and passes right up against the entire back wall of the house. The branches of trees caught in the whirling winds rake across the back. Now there are a row of windows across that wall. The windows are breaking and flying glass is all over the place. Miraculously we are not injured but it is a close call. (284 words)

We move away from them. I see a huge pile of stuff. Clothes, toys, lots of things. Bonnie and I are trying to sort them, fold them and pack them. The girls are there, running around, playing. They aren't interested in what we are trying to do. (76 words)

I am supposedly at Ginny and Ernie's house. Five members of a blues band are there temporarily, after a performance. The woman member is serving up a dinner she cooked. I sit at the table choosing to sit next to the handsome dark haired leader of the band. I like this opportunity to practice flirting. He is not particularly interested and moves his place to across the table. A large, coarse featured faced man sits by me. I'm not as interested in him.. The woman serves the meal. I look at it. Caviar and hot-dogs (bunched together like bananas) and fruits like grapes and melon chunks. It looks unappetizing, especially the black Caviar. I tentatively taste the food and am surprised that I enjoy the taste. But the look of the of it, and knowing its fish eggs makes it hard for me to relax and fully enjoy it. The woman wants the group to leave today and go home so she can work on her blues singing. I want them to stay 2 more days they had planned on so I can practice flirting. She asks each one if they want to go. They are ambivalent. She leaves on her own and then comes back in. She's singing a blues song and in the song she pops up in the head and chest part of a mermaid statue singing. I also see the mermaid statues head and chest laying in a cradle like part of another statue. (248 words)

["Refusing other people's responsibilities."] Charla and I live in an old house, all on one floor, with white walls, long halls and room after room down the halls. Irv moves in. He is down a long forgotten hall. Charla and I are cleaning up. I pick up a box of huge men's shoes and think they are Irv's. I carry them down the hall, then cross an intersection of halls into the one I'd forgotten was there. I see signs on his closed door saying Keep Out. I see drawers in the wall next to his door and open one or two. I see old curtains and things. I find one drawer with some room in it. Then I lay the giant shoes on the floor next to his door. I return to our living area to clean some more. Dovre comes in and hands me a box with a big plant in it (like the one in Charla's room now).She says non nonchalantly, Will you put that in the room? I take the box but I am angry. I then decide this isn't OK and put the box down on the floor next to the door of my room. I say you have no right to ask me to do that. It is big and heavy and hard for me to do with my arthritis. Then it is time to go to work. We get into a small red sports car convertible. I am driving. It begins to snow. We are in Germany apparently. We pull up to the business door. I am angry at Dovre and am lecturing her. I tell her she has to get a life of her own, and quit desperately connecting with my life. I get out and put up the top on the car. I walk into the business. Again long white halls. It was an easy 2 steps up to the door, but just inside the building is a long flight of stairs going down. I walk it, feeling pretty good about it, but I am concerned I will run out of energy and feel tired. I decide I want to walk with a cane and one appears. I feel more comfortable now, surprised I am walking so well. I walk down long halls, turning right and then left. I find a room that might be my new office. It is room 409. I ask some man if this is my room. He says go to the lobby and ask there. I ask where the lobby is. He says In the front of the building, of course. Like I am stupid for not knowing that. I walk down more halls and find a big nice lobby. (450 words)

["Racing well."] I go into a huge stadium, indoors. Thousands of women are attending a special Woman's Conference. I walk up a long ramp and find chairs in a row up high in the stadium. I look back down the ramp and see rows and rows of already seated women. It's a long way back to the rest rooms and I need to pee. I decide to wait. Signs are being placed in front of our chairs. I then decide to find a rest room. I walk some distance and find a bathroom with a large bathtub in it. The warm water is already drawn. It is a cleansing ritual says the man in charge. I get into the tub. The water is clean and a bit cool. I want it warmer, and turn the faucet on to add hot water. I am clothed in a black spaghetti strap top. Bonnie comes in. She wants to take a bath. I tell her this isn't a bath, with soap to get clean. This is a special cleansing ritual. I get out and put a leopard spotted T-shirt under the skimpy black top. The man tells me I must wear it over the top. I rearrange the tops. I leave the bathroom, still wet, but not uncomfortable. I get in a manual wheelchair. The man tells me the ramp is steep at first, and will be a bit hard to go up, but then it evens off and is easier. I struggle hard to push myself up the steep ramp. I manage to get to the top and see a downward slope with tight corners. Now it's a challenge, fun and fast. I lean into it to gather speed and take the corners like a race car, loving the excitement of barely making the corners with squealing tires. I do well and am having fun. (311 words)

["Luscious fruit feast."] I am visiting two older grey haired women. Rosalie and perhaps her sister. They are retired and quite wealthy. We get into a small private airplane of theirs. Rosalie is the pilot. We are flying to their summer cottage on the coast. I wonder if we are safe. We land safely on a road. The cottage is huge and has many rooms. Lovely furnishings. I start to walk to the window to see the ocean but am distracted to yet another room. A feast is prepared and one table is filled with lush cantaloupes, strawberries and grapes. The colors are bright and very enticing. They look luscious. I am curious to return and see the view of the ocean. I start for that room again when I notice the entire cottage is moving like a sideways elevator. The landscape is spinning by very fast. Finally it stops and I look out. I see a vague coast line, but no ocean. I am disappointed. (163 words)

["Not much of a vacation."] I had a mini vacation for the weekend and had been staying the one night at a hotel. It is the next morning and I want to pack and return home. I have lots of things to pack. A man and perhaps some other people are there, observing me as I pack. Apparently I am some famous person. I can't find my suitcase and remember I gave it to the bell hop or someone. I dig around under a vanity and find a bag. I am putting clothes in there from the floor. I put aside some old papers with pictures that have sentimental value related to my loved one who was famous. The man watches closely as I hold them aside carefully so they won't be harmed. I continue packing. I see a great many cut fruits that had fallen or put on the floor in a corner. Left overs, I guess. I need to clean up that mess and get the fruits into the wastebasket. Melon slices, strawberries and grapes. I start to scrape them up. Someone helps me. I then put my special papers into a pocket on the outside of the bag I'm packing in so they are protected. It is almost done. I realize I didn't really do anything special for my vacation. Just stayed over night at the hotel in anticipation of going out and having fun the next day. Now I'm not interested, I just want to go home. (246 words)

["Celebrating Dad."] I am in a house sitting at a round table. I think this is my parents' house, although I don't recognize the house. It doesn't actually exist. Just the table. I am living with them or visiting, I'm not sure. I have at least 1000 dollars. I am trying to figure out how to make more money with it. Maybe I gambled for it or just had good luck, I don't know. Now I am outside and my father is standing in front of me. He turns to face me and is talking about the things he's done in his life. I look beyond him and see a long line of relatives coming out of the trees into the meadow we are in. They are coming to the celebration of my father's life. It is supposed to be a surprise for my father so I keep him talking. I think he knows, and is cooperating. Now they are all seated at a long table. I stand at the head of the table and begin a speech chronicling my father's life and accomplishments. After I am done, I realize I didn't ask for any input from my brothers and sister. I apologize to Lydia, saying I was rolling along and never thought to ask them if they had anything to say. They don't seem to be bothered. I walk around. I see Aunt Elaine. I look at her face. She looks different. I think she looks fine. I wonder why my mother hates her. I like her just fine. I see Suzanne who hasn't seemed to grow up. Maybe she is 15 years old. I try to calculate how old Elaine is. It doesn't make sense. I walk around more and see Patricia. Her face is much older, wrinkled. I am surprised. I also see Grandma Anne and am surprised to see her as she is dead. And then Chester. Who is also dead. It is quite the Sanders reunion. (329 words)

["Pulling teeth for fun."] I am holding a circular column of rows of perfect teeth. I seem to be compulsively pulling the teeth out, one at a time. I am fascinated with the sensation of pulling them. I keep thinking this isn't a good idea. I need teeth, but I keep doing it. I am down to the last of 4 or 5 rows. I pull one out of the last row and decide to stop because now it would show as a gap when I smiled. I still want to do it, but I stop. (92 words)

I am walking in the ocean along the beach about thigh deep. At least I tell myself I am thigh deep, but I don't actually see the water on my legs. I see a wall of water on my left about that height. I am picking up tomato like plants and pulling them out of the ground by their tops which look like carrot tops. I then bury them into the sand again and they transform into eggs which quickly change into hard boiled. Then a sort of human being grows up rapidly out of that. It's kind of fun to watch, but then I get concerned that these new life forms will be abandoned and will die. It's not a good thing to do this for fun and then not be there to help the new creatures.

["Beautiful me and no dance partner."] I am at a dance. I am young, slim and beautiful I am wearing a velvet black evening gown, very form fitting. A diagonal line of spangles across the midriff from breast to hip. My hair is lovely. A touch of red velvet in the form of a small evening purse completes the outfit. I stand and watch the people, looking for the man that will come claim me. Several rather ugly men come near and look but turn and leave me standing there. I am relieved they didn't choose me and feel a bit lonely and rejected. I conjure up a man who looks like Robert Downey, very handsome. He begins to look at me possibly interested. In the dream I wanted a touch of red and thought up the purse, and I wanted a man who looked like Robert Downey to be there and he appeared. (148 words)

["Kind aunts."] I am trying to knit a sweater of soft blue yarn. I am making something for Paulina. I look at it and see I've forgotten to follow the fisherman knit cable pattern and am doing a simple knit design. I also dropped a few stitches which created a run. I pack it and several other knitting projects away as I am leaving. Several of my aunts are there. I might even be in Grandpa Lee and Grandma Maude's house. Aunt Charlotte walks with me holding my hands very caringly and is very loving and caring. Perhaps Naomi is in the background, concerned and loving as well. (106 words)

["Ginny helps me improve my house."] It's an odd house I live in. Sort of the 40th Avenue house and yet quite different. Ginny is there and is helping me fix things up to look nicer. She calls me outside to see what she did with the lawn. I step out the living room door and step onto a lawn so thick and lush it's like a well manicured carpet. Near the door she has placed a Buddha type statue. I walk out toward the street. The lawn is a healthy dark green. It is higher and thicker in some places. I look where the driveway used to be. It is also lawn. I say well, I used to have a garden there, but I haven't planted it in a long time. So I approve of the replacement of the garden with this lawn. I look to see if the sidewalk was also covered since the parking strips are also all lawn. I see a narrow sidewalk remaining. I go back inside the house. I look up at the ceiling. Large ceiling tiles are falling off revealing an opaque plastic tarp. Ginny is up there crawling around. I call out to her to be careful. She might fall through the ceiling. I am concerned that the tiles are falling. Ginny comes back in. I look up again and see the tiles are replaced and all is well. Now Ginny is putting up Charla's art work on a high wall. A face of a man and a face of a woman in 3/4 profile. Crude line drawing, but interesting. Then several abstract colorful pieces. She is putting my pictures up for me. I agree with where she is putting them, not being very specific abut where I might want them. (293 words)

["Fighting the man in prison."] I am in prison. A huge scary prisoner, male, is coming toward me with the intent of beating the hell out of me. I come out of my cell knowing he will beat me and knowing I can't win, but by God, I'm going to try hard to survive. He comes at me and we grapple. I bite, poke his eye, and do anything I can to hurt him and fight back. It makes enough of a nuisance that he backs off, admiring my bravery and doggedness. I now walk freely down the hall and down a long flight of stairs to the cafeteria for lunch. A woman hands me a toasted piece of bread. I tell her I don't eat bread, and then accept it, changing my mind. I gather up a plate load of food. I am safe now. (141 words)

["George W. Bush Jr. cooks for me."] I am in my bed, somewhere, sleeping. I wake up to discover George W. Bush Jr. cooking some soup for me as a demonstration of his cooking skills. He is a candidate for President. I ask him at least three questions and he does not respond. It's as though he is deaf or concentrating so hard he can't hear me. I get out of bed when he pours the soup, which appears to be vegetable. I take the cup and see only a small amount of broth in the bottom. I sip it. I can not taste or smell anything but I say Oh, how good. Thank you. He still doesn't respond. (112 words)

["Performance."] Celeste and I are improving some acting stuff and the Uni House women are watching, enjoying us. Then Diane R. and Celeste continue on and I watch. They are marvelous. Perfect coordination of their words and gestures and movements. The women gather around them. I feel a bit jealous and left out, but quickly let go of that as I am so amazed at their flawless performance. (67 words)

["Another sprawling house with many rooms."] I am apparently living with my parents in a long sprawling one story house with many unexplored rooms. I am carrying a notebook and some things that fell out of my purse. I see a photo and want to cut out the part of the picture of Charla. It is a school photo of a group of kids. Their back is to the camera. It is a snapshot. I finally locate Charla in the center and partially covered by the others. As I watch, the photo becomes animated. She turns and is clear to see. I quickly cut out around the outline of her, being careful to cut out the flowing lines of the muffler she is wearing. I get it cut out and I want to put it up on the door of my bedroom. I remember I had moved from my old bedroom to this other room and walk down the hall to go there. I am in a sort of lobby area and I hear a crash. I look to see a small red car I thought was a sports car convertible had crashed through the glass door to the indoor porch. I look again and see it is a small kiddie car, red and convertible. A boy had crashed his car into the door. I call my father who asks the boy his telephone number to call his parents to get payment for the damages. As he is doing that I notice yet another room I didn't know was there. I walk over some fragile rotten boards and open the door. It is a dark musty room with old old paper trash all over. Dingy, square and uninteresting. I shut the door. I see another door and carefully walk along the edges of a very rotten flooring and open that door and see the inside insulation of a freezer. I shut it. Now I remember I used to live in another wing and walk back down the hall. I walk through a kitchen and notice all the dishes are clean and put away. Apparently my mother does the housework and I am relieved I don't have to. I turn left down another hall. I see a bedroom on the left that used to be my parents' bedroom and then I lived there for awhile. I go on. I decide to not explore the entire series of rooms. I'd been there before. Then I look out the window and see I am in a rural small town and wish I could live in the city where activities and art and performances happen. I ask myself if I'd go even if they were available. I walk on down a hall that has become the small town's street. I look in a building and see several children and adults in wheelchairs. I am intrigued and go in to find myself in a weight room establishment. I am happy to see they are wheelchair accessible. I decide to explore this town. I go across the street to the grocery store and go in. Now I come out on the weird handlebars of a man's bicycle. I am seated like in a small chair. He is very close and wrapped around me but not touching. He is very attracted to me and is giving me a ride around town to show me what's there. I am a bit afraid because he's a stranger and I shouldn't be accepting rides from strangers, but I am excited also because he is sexy and attractive. We tease and talk. He keeps trying to sneak a kiss. I enjoy the attraction, but am unwilling to let go and make love as we are strangers. Later, perhaps. We go down a long long flight of stairs that are a sidewalk in bricks. It is a bumpy ride and there is a group of people ahead of us. I am very impressed with how well he drives the bike with me on it not hitting the people or loosing balance. He's taking me home now and even though I am sexually turned on. I know it is important not to leap into this too quickly. I allow him one passionate kiss at the door. (707 words)

["Gay man is my protection."] I am in Duffy's tavern alone. I see Tom Hanks sitting alone at a table. I sit down with him and say "You are gay. He is startled. I then say I'd like to sit with you so it looks like we are together. I don't want to be hit on. I just want to have fun and dance and maybe meet a nice guy. He thinks that's an OK idea. We are alibis for each other. (77 words)

["Investigative reporting."] I am outdoors. I'd been asked to do a small bit in a video promo about disability. Three of us stand in a row in front of a large standing audience. We each have a letter of the alphabet to mime in a hand gesture. The three letters are COC. I am the second C. I manage to do this even with my deformed hand. After that is over I go inside and ask for any odd jobs they may have. A male editor says yeah. Here's one and hands me a note. I am to call some people to interview them. I try and try to reach one man. He won't answer the phone. He is a war vet and there is some mystery. I am also researching the subject. Pulling files out of the file drawers. I notice newspaper clippings all over the floor and see one. I read it. It is the story of a grandfather that decided to commit suicide. He visits his Grandchildren for a last afternoon together. They are grateful for the time with him. They go bird watching. They see regular Wrens. Then they are lucky enough to see a Super Wren. It is a beauty. As I read this I notice the irony of them enjoying seeing the Super Wren and at the same time he's already decided to die. Seems strange to me. Wouldn't the wonders of life pull him back into life?

["Accessibility issues."] I am in an office, supposedly where I work and it is my office. I am seated in my wheelchair and behind me is a water fountain, ornamental, with pretty rocks in it. I go out of the office, down the hall to get to the bathroom in the back room. I complain to the women there that their work materials are all cluttered and blocking my aisle to the bathroom and back. I am annoyed. I get back into the office, which I seem to share with Theodore and perhaps Hank. I see someone has been working on my pretty water fountain. I see huge chunks of quartz crystals in what used to be empty spaces between rocks. I think that looks pretty. I see a second fountain. I suddenly notice that the water tubes are not fixed right so that water is running down the wall and under my chair and all over. The office area is cluttered also and things are getting ruined. I exclaim, upset now who did that! I decide to complain to the boss. I wheel quickly down a long hall and around a right corner. I see a woman secretary and call to her that I want to see the boss. An older woman in a wheelchair comes out. She's the boss. I tell her I have some accessibility issues I want to complain about. She gestures me into her office. She putts around trying to clear off a space to work. Finally, I go on down the hall, meeting one barrier after another. I am getting more and more frustrated. I find a very narrow door way that has those bars in them like revolving gates. I yell, this is inaccessible. A large robot arm very padded, comes through and motions to me to follow it. I say do you mean me? Barb? It wriggles it's hand end yes. I follow it through a now opened area beside the narrow doors. Three or more brown uniformed police or security guards are there. They are telling me that things are in progress and will be better. I am annoyed. Now the hall is a road sort of and lots of cars and trucks and odd looking wheelchair contrivances, Mark H. in a golf cart like wheelchair. He bumps into the rear end of a truck. I am now very upset I am near a policeman and I say with relish, Just try me. This is terrible that wheelchair traffic is mixed with bigger more dangerous vehicles. Keep this up and you'll get quite a protest. I am eager to take them on. I wonder if it is wise to brag so loudly in front of them that I will be a damned nuisance to them very soon. I wheel back to the office to complain. I see someone like Hank and I want to kick him. but I can't because he is 9 months pregnant. I grumble it's not fair, because it isn't even him that is carrying the baby. I look up to see the boss is now a very pregnant wife of Howard. I am frustrated. How am I going to complain about Howard with his own wife, my boss. Frustrated! (540 words)

["Speeches are fun and easy."] I am in a room like Toastmasters with the tables in a "V" formation. I am standing at the speaker's end, making impromptu speeches on familiar subjects, like dreams. I seem to be doing just fine and feeling comfortable. Celeste is around helping. I make speech after speech, happy I am doing so well and feeling comfortable. (57 words)

It feels very comfortable. Later, there is a man, friendly and we might be starting a relationship. (70 words)

["Magic shoes."] I am a young teen walking into a gym. My coach welcomes me and hands me a pair of white sneakers. He says don't expect these sneakers to be as good as the first pair I let you wear. I remember they were red high top sneakers. These were regular white sneakers. I look around for the socks. I find thick bootie type socks and put them on, glad for their protection. I wonder if I'll be able to walk in these flat shoes, much less play basketball. I stand and walk, very glad to see I can move quite well in these sneakers. I go out on the gym floor and join the team. We aren't very good. I am waving my hands saying, here, here. I'm open. The young girl holding the basketball totally ignores me. I go up to her and say why didn't you pass the ball to me? She wandered off. I try and make a basket but it is so high I know I won't make it and hesitate. I run back and forth between the two baskets, playing, and marveling at how well I seem to be able to move with these flat sneakers. As it continues, I get better and better, finally jumping up and popping in a basket. The coach is watching carefully as he moves with me, yelling encouragement. Now the ball seems like a deflated plastic bubble and I can't get it to dribble and bounce. I call out that we need a better ball. Someone brings out a ball bag and I see the other balls are weird and deflated also. I finally find a regular basketball which has enough air. I play better now. (287 words)

["Man resists me."] I am swimming in a swim pool. It is a laps contest. I am doing the back stroke and doing it well. I feel the enjoyment of cleaving through the water and being well coordinated. I am powerful and graceful. I pass them all. I go back and forth quickly. Now I am out of the pool. I am attracted to a military officer who is attracted to me. It is all very non verbal. He is resisting me. I don't know why. I am wearing jeans and a shirt. I put on a slinky white dress with a back slit. Over this outfit. It is tight and I struggle to get it on. I am now walking toward his area. Perhaps a tent. I feel a bit silly, because the jeans show under the hem of the dress. I walk in and he sees me. He wants to spend time with me, but he fights the urge. Now I go up to him very close and ask him what's wrong? Is he married? Why does he ignore me? He is abrupt and walks away from me. I guess I'll never know. (192 words)

["Strange cafe and distant dreamwork."] I have traveled for the weekend down to some town to work with Bill and the graduate students on my dreams. I spend the first night with Nancy and Mary (my old PA's) who apparently are grad students of Bill's. We sleep out in a parking lot. I carry a black purse that I am careful to have with me at all times. I left it where we slept and felt worried and came back to find it. The students and Bill have already gone off to a cafe called "The Bomb" to discuss my dreams. I feel left out, but decide I can find them. First I have to go pee, so I cross the street and go into a building and find the bathroom. I pee in a glass square, one of four in a row. Then I walk up the street, concerned that I am alone and maybe ruffians will come and bother me. I make it to the cafe safely. I walk in and the students and Bill are already in discussion around a round table. I sit at a small side table and try to listen in. One or two of the women students acknowledge my presence. Otherwise, it's as though I wasn't there. A woman student suggests I should see the unusual zoo display. I walk with her and see a petting zoo kind of arrangement. A large low box with animals in it. I first see a calf's head, but no body. It is alive and wavering around in the air. I feel queasy looking at it. I see on the right, a black cat seated and a rabbit on a small box quietly seated. I am aware a pigeon is there too. I look back at the calf's head and see a dirty white glove resting on it's head. Then it passes under the head as though it was a magicians hand proving there were no wires. I comment on the odd bad smell in the cafe. I return to where the discussion of my dreams is supposedly happening. The nice male grad student is trying to be helpful. I need to leave on Sunday and I tell him I leave at :544. He's going to help me get to the plane. (380 words)

["Three questions of the dreamer?"] I am in a gym like room. Bill is conducting his dream class. The grad students are lined up, seated around the walls of the square room. They are some distance from me and Bill is in the center of this expansive floor. A woman student asks me "What are your thoughts on Marriage?" I chuckle and say this is a hard question for me. I have conflicted feelings on this subject. I was married for 10 years. It was not a good experience. I worked for years on understanding and learning how to work through those issues. If a man comes along who can be my good friend as well as a lover, then I would consider marrying him. I had turned my head toward Bill so he could for sure hear what I am saying. Then another woman student (not one of the DreamWorkers) asks me a long question. I say I didn't understand all you said, but I did hear it's something about transportation and relationship. She then stands up and walks right up to me, I am sitting. She towers over me as she repeats the question. I stand up and say please don't do that. I then stand over her as she sits back in her spot. I end up standing straddle over her bowed head. I worry she will turn her head and be looking up my long skirt. I feel embarrassed. I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea. I step back and say that's what it feels like. It's very demeaning. I try to answer her question saying something about relationship. I hesitate over choosing the word person rather than man when answering the question. Then Bill tells the class it is time for the quiz. I sit over next to the nice woman grad student. He asks the question. I don't clearly hear it I only hear something about what will you do if you meet someone at a train and your job is to entertain them and they are boring. The class writes their answers. I watch. (348 words)

["Dwight yanked up into the sky."] I am in a house where my parents live. It's time to fix dinner and apparently I am the only one in the house that does any work. Oh well, I don't mind helping my mother who works so hard. I begin opening drawers to see what's available. I see things have been moved around. I see the beef casserole on the stove, maybe left out too long. I see corn on the cob, in their husks in the drawer. Bread loaves of home made bread also. Then Dwight comes in and now Dwight and I are the same character. He has been grabbed by the back of his jacket by some huge invisible force that is propelling him through the house. He is forced down the hall and sees my father in the bedroom. He calls out to my father and says This force has a hold of me. My father laughs and says quit fooling around. Dwight/I is propelled back down the hall and straight out the front door. My father now believes him and is following trying to reach him to help him. As soon as Dwight/I are out the door, we are forced straight up into the blue sky. Up and up we go. It is frightening. I see a cloud as I look up, then we are even with it and then we are above it. We are afraid the force will release us and we will fall to our death. Up we continue until there is another land up there and we are deposited there. We see a train waiting and people boarding it. Someone tells us to go to the station and check in. We walk into the train station. People are seated around a round table. As we look at them, their human faces blur and we see alien faces. It is scary. Then we turn to the right to hear someone talking to us. It is Dwight in a blue Hawaii patterned shirt, balding on top. We are shocked to see ourselves facing us. He tells us we must catch the train and start at the next town. The train is just now starting to leave. We run out and run with the train as it increases speed. We hop on top of the yellow nose of the engine and the speed is now dangerously fast. We cling to the car as we frantically move toward the car to get inside. Finally we manage to get inside. We sit next to a man who says he thinks this is all made up for us. As the landscape streaks by and we are going up a steep hill on the rails (like a roller coaster ride) we see sudden patches of sky where the land was. It is scary, because if we don't continue to believe we are on solid land, we will fall through and fall to earth and die. We come to a town and get off. The man advises us to go straight to the house in front of us, not turn toward the right and go on into town. We do that, going into the house and realizing this will be our house. We are in the kitchen. I see a stove with the outer structure of a stand up piano. It's time to fix dinner. (558 words)

["A lovely many roomed house."] I am visiting a house I may rent or buy. I first check out the bathroom which is being remodeled. I see a large room, but a narrow doorway. I see an accessible toilet, then when I get in, it is an old inaccessible toilet with a sink over it. The man says he will have that all fixed if I move in. I walk down a hall and more and more rooms are seen. I turn left and another long hall, this time some steps up. They say they will ramp that but we'd lose some space in the kitchen. I walk through the kitchen, then the dining room and then a lovely living room. I return ad see the dining room has only a table and a refrigerator. I wonder why the refrige isn't in the kitchen. I decide if we make the dining room and the kitchen one room, we can fit the ramp. I go back to look at the living room. Lovely furniture, large made with beautiful woods. The woman reminds me that the beautiful furniture is hers and won't stay in the house after I move in. I wonder if then the rooms will look quite ordinary then. I am now sitting in a "room" which actually is a road with traffic passing through. The road seems to pass through my house. At one edge. I return into the house proper and see yet another little alcove room which is quite lovely. Neon art work. She turns them on so I can see them work. (261 words)

["Falling with Al Pacino."] I have a conference to attend. I need to drive about 2 hours to get there. If I leave now, I'll barely make it. A woman who looks like Captain Janeway is concerned she won't be able to fit all the sheep she just bought into her car to take them home. I look at the inside of my van which is very spacious. I say They will fit here. I offer to take her home. Meanwhile a group of students, perhaps like Bill's grad students need a ride home as well. I let them in also. I am a bit mad at myself because this will make me late for what I want to do, but I did it anyway. I am driving and look back into the van seeing it crammed full of sheep and grad students. I shake my head in amazement at how silly this is and how crowded. I let them out and then I am in the back seat of a car and Al Pacino is in the driver's seat. I am however, driving with the steering wheel from my passenger seat behind him. I look up to see we are on a path directly headed for a terrible fall. The road suddenly turns 95 degrees to the left to get to a bridge over a huge expanse of water. I realize we aren't turning. I don't say anything as it all happened so quickly. Off the road we go. I remember I'd done this before in a dream and how horrible it felt, with the intense fear. This time I feel some fear, but it's not so bad. The car noses down and we are falling fast and straight down toward the land. It is certain death, or so it seems. Now the car is gone and we are falling. Al says to me move to where you are over the water. I wriggle around and manage to land in the water. I hit and go deep down. I come back up and swim to the shore, glad to be alive. We get ashore. I run to him and we kiss, so happy to be alive. Now we are attracted to each other. We hold hands as we walk around a long huge high wall of bookcases. Behind the cases we turn and are walking back toward the road. I see boxes and boxes of my stuff. I start retrieving some. I find my dream books and am specifically picking up as many of those as I can find. I want to recover them all. It's getting heavy and cumbersome, but I still keep trying. (442 words)

["Biking with Charla to M City."] I and Charla are going on my bike to M City but first we take a "small" detour to a special restaurant for breakfast. We get there to discover snow on the ground. I have a hard time parking the van. I can't seem to find a place close enough that leaves room for the lift to open. When we get out and get up to the door of the restaurant, we find out there is a 45 minute wait or more as the restaurant is full. We decide to go on. Back in the van, we go sliding down a very steep driveway back to the road. We are on the bike now and bouncing over the large rocks that are like gravel on the side of the road. It is going to take us 5 hours to get over the mountain to M City for Thanksgiving dinner. I am tired already. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. (160 words)

["Finding an office."] I am in a school, maybe like the community college. I have some paper work to do. But I don't have a place to work yet, as I am just starting back. I see Mabel in the hall. She greets me with a smile. She wants to show me her class she is very proud of creating. It has a teacher for each student. A mentor program. I look into the classroom from the hall. A long line of teachers are seated in a row at a table. Facing each teacher is a long line of students. The teachers are smiling and happy to be of help. The students are OK, but not as happy as the teachers. I then walk down the hall. I see a desk at the end of the hall and I feel very tired. I lie down on the desk to nap, since I can barely keep my eyes open. Later I am back up and go to an office that will become mine. Transition time. (171 words)

["Robert Redford and the priest."] I am enacting a scene in a play over and over. Now I see Robert Redford sitting. He smiles and asks for a kiss. I think a kiss would be fun. I walk over to him and sit in his lap. We have a long sexy kiss. I get back up. Robert indicates he'd like to meet me later for more. I agree. Even though he is married. Later I am talking with a priest. He makes some cliche statement from the doctrine of the church. I say to him as an aside (while the entire congregation listens in), isn't that superstitious? Not even faith, or mythology, but flat out superstition. He agrees, a bit embarrassed. Even the congregation nods their heads in agreement. The priest has an idea. He wants us to act out or pursue an idea. But he knows it will mean I can't meet with Robert later. He feels bad for me as he knows I am looking forward to it. I wish I could be with Robert, but I also am interested in pursuing this idea. I follow the priest. (185 words)

["Dream symbols revisited."] I decide to go for a walk. I am outside going down a street. I turn to the right. I want to put an ad in the E City Weekly. I don't remember exactly where it was. I cross a street and say now I'm in the old section, where I had dreamed this scene before. I look up and see signs across the street on wires. I see P and P3 and P Girls. Ah, just like in another dream, I think. I see a store on the left and turn in to it. No, wrong one. I go down one more and go in. I found the place. I see a booth like machine I want to buy to work my dreams with. Someone asks me if I want a drink at the bar. I say no. I don't like to socialize at a bar. Then a woman invites me to a Women's Club meeting. I go in. I am now wearing a gray slim dress, looking sort of 1950's women's club fashion, like all the other women. Then I am up front with the four speakers. The one speaking I suddenly realize is Dora. I am so surprised and happy because she is dead now. It's my turn to speak and I say with deep feeling how grateful I am for dreams because I know it isn't really Dora standing there, it is some Asian woman I don't know, but the dreams permit me to visit Dora again. I cry deeply and sadly for Dora. Then I start giving a speech on my Rheumatoid Arthritis and my experiences with that. I see there are other women waiting to speak and I trail off and hand the mike to them. They don't want to speak and the speeches are over,. (302 words)

I find a bathroom with four stalls and go to the end one. I open the door. No toilet. I move my chair out of the way and open the next one. Then a woman comes out of the end stall. I hadn't seen her in there. I apologize to her. Now we go back to the store. The bored woman says too bad the machine is broken. It is really another store that made them and they don't give money back. I should just sue them right away. Lots of luck. I question her more I say well, didn't you sell this to me knowing they won't fix it unless I sue? Then I can sue you. I am assertive and right. She is unhappy. (203 words)

["Three Jewish men and me."] Susie and Tom have invited me to a cafe with them. They sit at a table and direct me to sit away from them at another table, alone. I do it. Then three young Jewish men join me. Susie is setting us up hoping I'll like one and date him. The three are seated in a line across the table from me. The one directly across from me is talkative and interesting. We begin to enjoy the conversation. Suddenly, they get up and walk out. I half teasingly say Is it something I said? Because I don't know why they left. I get up and go find Susie and Tom. They are curt and tell me to return to my table. I do it. I decide I will rearrange the couch and table which had been set to turn in toward me. I turn it around so it will be more inviting for the public to join in. I look out the window and see the three men had changed their clothes and have returned. The one man looks at the furniture change and says he liked it the original way because it was more intimate. I say well, I was trying to include more people in my life. We now walk down the hall to the other room where Susie and Tom are. Now Charlton Heston enters. He has a hand grenade and is going to go out and throw it as there are enemies out there, possibly Arab. I agree to help him throw one too. (258 words)

["Shopping in the library."] I am at home somewhere and looking at a computer screen trying to get some information to scroll up. I think I am ordering things off the computer. Bonnie and Mateo come over. She tells me of a great sale in the library. I want to go but have to put the groceries away first. Then I realize that Mateo had driven the car away to go to his job and forgot to unload the groceries. I worry the hamburger will spoil if not refrigerated in time. Now we go to the library. As we walk in, I see huge shelves with many thousands of books, big and colorful and interesting lining the room. I like it here. Now along the bottom edge of the walls are candles and huge shoes and purses. I stroll along the line looking at the candles and the prices. Some stick candles for 88 cents. Some pillar candles for 1.39. Bonnie shows me a very tall pillar candle. She says that is for the winter, but uses a foreign word for it. I think I'll get one too but she warns me it takes me three months to burn a small candle and we wouldn't want the candle to last to summer when it could melt. I decide not to buy it. The shoes are very very large!! I pick up a purse and look inside it. Not enough room, but a nice shape. (240 words)

I see it and then notice a black fiborous tuft and pull it off, then I see more of them and then I see a Geod glued on to my belly and then more polished pretty stones.

More and more keep appearing!. (95 words)

["Not prepared."] I am waiting for the beginning of a concert I will attend. Dwight is with me. I see Ginny and her father in law arrive. I call out to them. Then don't hear and go into the auditorium. I am waiting out in the stairwell, hall. Suddenly I remember that at 7:30, the same time the concert starts, I am supposed to be giving a warm up speech on Assertiveness before the main guest speaker arrives. I remember I left the notes at home. I have 10 minutes and that's not enough time to make it home. I am frantic. I race into the speech room and ask for a spare copy of the syllabus. I find some notes and books on a shelf out in the hall and frantically try to find the ones for this speech. I throw the papers around and some slide onto the floor. I ask Dwight to pick them up for me so people won't slip on them. He says no, he doesn't want to. I am annoyed with him for not being helpful. I am agitated and upset, panicking because I can't remember what I was to talk on. I am already formulating what I could speak on. I'll make it, but I hate this rushed unprepared feeling. I wake up in an alert agitated state. (223 words)

I manage to get out, I guess as I am walking down a hall. A man in a wheelchair is there. He is an old high school acquaintance. Now we are walking across a river on a bridge. I look up to my left and see very tall evergreen trees. One of the tops of a tree is falling. It is itself so big it is as big as a full tree. I am concerned it will hit us. I stop and watch, glad to see it fell off to the left on the bank. We continue walking. I am relieved no one was injured. We cross the river. Now I'm in a wheelchair. I put on the brakes. The man, perhaps Mike P., says don't do that. You don't even know what is the correct way to maintain your chair. You don't even know the way it works best. (184 words)

I say yes, but I have a travel now pay later plan. I am already starting to hurt here and here, pointing out some painful places on my hands. Now I am walking to another room on a narrow line in black open toed high heels demonstrating how well I can walk in heels. I point out that I will be hurting later.

["A screw loose."] I am holding an intricate balloon set up Ernie gave me, perhaps something from the blood tests. I notice a screw is loose and I am trying to tighten the fastener. It isn't aligned correctly and as I fiddle with it, I walk out to the van. I see that all the rocks I gathered up from a creek bed are piled around the passenger seat. But Jake wants them to be moved. So I stand outside the van leaning in and scooping up handfuls of rocks some plain rocks shaped like potatoes and some white crystal like rocks. There are a lot of them and I keep scooping and moving. The rocks are now between the seats and a bit back into the van. Now I get into the driver's seat. I suddenly drop the screw out of the balloon fastener. Lydia comes over and I say can you help me look for it? I point to the floor of the van at the driver's seat to several screws. I say these are big ones that don't fit. It's a tiny screw. She is trying to help me look. (190 words)

She is cooking many of them, like one would with pancakes for a large group. Aunt Millie is there as well. Perhaps this is a family reunion. I suddenly realize that I should have been working on my task which is cutting up the salad veggies. I find them on a cart and begin to chop the lettuce. Some others help me. I see corn on the cob as well. I am not paying much attention, and my mother tells me to watch what I'm doing. I had tossed a weird corn on the cob which only has the silk hairs all dried out on it. I take it out of the salad fixings and start to throw it away. My mother says no. If you poke a hole in the top kernel here it will express lactose. I am not impressed. Who wants lactose? (167 words)

["Mom's secret."] My mother has disappeared. Perhaps she went into the hospital without letting us know. I am worried about her. Someone brings me a packet of her belongings from the hospital safe. I decide to open them and look even though it is obvious this is her secret stuff. I want to know her secret. First, is a roll of papers, poster size. I unroll them. A series of what look like advertising slogans. I think they are my father's art work and refold them. I can't get it to roll back up right and realize she will know someone looked. I shrug. Oh well. Next are two wrapped Christmas gifts shaped like jewelry cases. Now a faded brown photo. It's animated. My mother is lying on her belly in the dirt and grass of Nebraska. Her younger sister is to her left. She tells her to go close up for the photo. Then she sees, looks into the camera, and speaks to the photographer. "Gladys, stop this. Don't take the picture." She's annoyed and angry. Then I see a picture of a house. I've never seen this house before. A dark brown house with bright pink window frames. A big spacious many roomed old farm house. An old shed is to the right of it and I realize it looks familiar because it sort of the shape and placement of my father's current house and shed. I realize this is my mother's old family home. I see a paper with the word talent written on it. It is fancy artistic writing (like my father used to do.) I now know my mother's secret. She was in love with a boy named Joe. She refused his proposal to follow her dream of being an artist. But after Joe went away, she gave in and married my father and has regretted it ever since. (In the packet was a card, "To the younger Miss V." and a Christmas gift unwrapped. A many colored shirt with very fancy balloon sleeves. (337 words)

We go down a hall and find an area where books are being sold and food being served. The registration area is just beyond this. I see several women friends come over. I am surprised to see Bonnie there. I realize I should introduce Chakotay to my friends. One woman, perhaps like Julia B., overweight. Comes in front of us and sits on the ground. I introduce her. Then I try to talk with Bonnie and introduce her. I say, but where are you going to stay? She says I'll sleep in your van. I say, in Spanish, to impress Chakotay, that I didn't bring my communeta. I only have the carro. She says she will manage. Chakotay is concerned about her. He wants to help her. I belatedly realize she must be in trouble if she is here. He suggests she sneak into my room.

The next morning I get up and my mother wants me to clean up this mess. I say why should I have to do it? You didn't clean up anything, nor did the musicians. On older man, one of the musicians wakes up and leaves. My mother says if you won't clean up the mess, then just leave and live somewhere else. I say OK, I will. I go to my room to pack. Then I not only don't want to pick up the mess but I'm too tired to pack. I just want someone else (my mother?) to clean up the mess. (174 words)

I then stop the car and decide to be smart about it and try and reorganize things as best I can before traveling down the road. Usually I go and suffer the consequences.

They try to find one for me, but no luck. I finally figure out how to get the images up on the wall so everyone can see them. But they aren't the right images.

["Ideas flowing."] Lucy and Mirabelle and I are going to see a wonderful exhibit of things from the past. And some art work. We have to walk down a long flight of wooden stairs. We are joking back and forth about the usual inaccessibility problems. I manage to walk it. Now we are in a huge square basement room. All around the edges are exhibits. It seems an unimaginative way to present the memorabilia and art work from the past. There are tour groups going through. Like in the Palace of Versailles. We've apparently missed our group and we walk around the perimeter looking at the groups of old furniture from days gone by. It's kind of uninteresting. Then I see a grouping where the glass vases on glass stalks move I am intrigued because I can see it like a movie director would. As It moves to my eye level I see a round "eye" shaped bowl looking right at me. Then as I move up it curls up into a "eye" shape looking up at the sky. I think this is really neat and keep moving up and down to see the effect. I find Lucy and Mirabelle and tell them of this neat movie director idea I had. They smile and move on. Lucy asks me what I think of my two plays being shown soon. I smile and say I am going to love that. Two of the pieces I wrote and I acted in one of them (American Woman). It will be fun seeing myself as big as a wall. (up on the giant screen.). Then the three of us sit on a couch and discuss what kind of anal we imaged when we heard a story of this animal. I realize that the name of the animal wasn't revealed and I just assumed it was a porcupine. Mirabelle says she thought it was a raccoon. I am surprised. Then Lucy says it could be a kangaroo. I am trying to be generous and say a raccoon is cute. A kangaroo would be fine. What do you think Mirabelle? She says Lucy, do you really like the kangaroo? Because if you do, I'll go with that. But if it's just Barb wanting the Kangaroo, then I don't. My feelings are a bit hurt by this. I try to joke about me being s second class citizen, like a disabled person. The animal story has something to do with disability issues. (413 words)

His job duties call. He must leave. He asks me to stay and wait for him to return. H doesn't know how long it will be. I agree. After he leaves, I look around the room very curious about who this mystery man is. I see old fashioned lovely wood furniture. A glass curio cabinet with pretty things in it. I wander around the corner and see a utility room and a kitchen beyond that. I very much want to peek into things but I decide to be honest and don't. I wait many hours. Finally he returns. We love each other. It's going to be wonderful. (175 words)

["Upset ambulance driver."] I am talking to a young man. We are looking at a large expanse of lawn and a curvy dangerous road. I am telling him that the new road will cut across this lawn and be safer and easier to get to the college. Now we both get in my manual chair to go back toward town. We slide off the sidewalk onto a lawn bank. I am wearing white high heels which makes pushing the wheelchair with my feet very hard and painful. We struggle to get the wheelchair back on the sidewalk. He gets out to make it easier. I am now going downhill and call out this is the fun part. I go faster and faster. Then I hit gravel and come to a stop. I get out and we walk toward the town. Now we are in the back of an ambulance racing toward town. We are observing. A woman is supposedly dead and bloody under a sheet. She met with some terrible fatal accident. But I hear breathing. I'm not sure if she is dead or not. We arrive downtown. We get out. I hear a woman say if you want help fixing up the fire house, you have to buy my two mink stoles that are in litigation with my case I'm doing. We agree to do that. I place the two mink stoles on a shelf in the entrance to the fire house. The entrance is blocked by these shelves. A woman who likes the ambulance driver puts a series of yummy breakfast dishes on the other shelves. The driver comes there and sees this. He is angry and upset. His mother had two mink stoles she would have liked to get rid of and now she can't. And someone broke the tradition of the breakfast dishes. He is angry at the woman who likes him. She is trying to convince him to relax and enjoy the breakfast dishes. Sweet rolls and so on. He is in a huff. (336 words)

["Annoying Howard and the bad gangsters."] I am at a school. I am struggling with math and banking and business assignments. I just don't get it. I am lost. The teacher piles on the homework. I feel overwhelmed. I am home now and I must work on all that homework. It could take all night. I sit on the couch and complain about how I don't understand what to do and how hard this is and how much there is to do. I resist beginning. I tell brother Dwight to turn on the news on TV so I can watch while I'm working. He does it. Then Howard comes in. He wants to watch another show and wants to turn the channel. I snap at him, hey, there are 2 TV's in the house. You can watch your show in the kitchen with the other TV. He is surprised and annoyed. Later, he comes on the couch with me and puts his dirty stinky foot, with black smudged socks on right where I am working. I am sort of wedged in a crack between couch pillows. I snap at him again to get his sticky feet out of my way. He is being a real annoyance. I am angry at him. Now some gangsters come in. They are going to kill me by forcing me to swim in a lake. I can't swim. Now it is Roseanne who is being threatened and I am her friend trying to help her escape. She seems unwilling to help herself. She whines that she can't swim and will die and how afraid she is. I am giving her swimming instructions as the gangsters take her to the lake. I tell her she can float for days and outlast them. She doesn't really pay attention. Now we are in the lake and she has some metal breathing apparatus on and I am swimming with her saying, head out of water, breath in, head under water, breath out. See? You can do it. She struggles. We are going to survive. (339 words)

["Moving."] I am moving out of an apartment and have all my things out now. I had a friend like Anastasia's friends take my TV to California with them and bring it back. This out of the way route seemed to be the most convenient way to get it to my new place. Now I am walking down the city street, like MM City, but not. I am getting tired, walking. The way seems much longer than I thought. I realize I haven't yet given notice to the manager and will probably have to pay extra fees. That's OK. I wanted to move. I then come to a city intersection. I see a runaway truck out of control and it is headed toward me. I turn and try to run back down the alley I was walking in. I narrowly escape being hit. Now the truck needs to back up down the alley I am in. I walk as fast as I can and the way is difficult because now there are ditches with loose boards in them and I step carefully in this precarious area. At one point I look back and the truck is backing up really close and I call out. Stop. I'm here. The truck driver sees me and slows up a bit, but I am still forced to move faster than I can safely travel. (229 words)

["Weird weather."] I am in a bath tub, standing up, time to dry off. Howard, sort of him, but his face is imaginary, stands just outside the tub and hands me a towel. I laughingly kiss him on the cheek. He is smiling. It is completely comfortable and friendly. I look at my left leg. It is very fat. I am surprised because the diet is working. I am concerned. I get out of the tub and dress. The room is very large with hardly any other furniture. Then the walls are moved like sets on a stage. They are rotated to other walls. I look out the window. Lots of rain is falling. I open the door and look out. I see small white moths descending like a locust plague. I am a bit concerned. I go out to try and protect the crops from the moths. They flutter all around and then take off with the wind. (157 words)

["Angry gays."] I am visiting some friends, possibly Jennifer H. or Dwan with their female partner. I am in the house and looking around. I see a very shiny pretty floor. I look out a window and admire the view of the mountains and trees, fall leaves and so on. I go outside and sit on the porch while Dwan goes to the store for something. It is only around the corner of the house. As I am looking at the lovely mountain scene, I see lots of people. Now lined up single file to leave the area. They are all gay or lesbian. They stand very close to the porch. They are angry at me. One man has a stubby ugly cigar and says I ought to destroy your home. I decide the safest thing to do is to just listen and not get involved by commenting back. He escalates his angry threatening remarks. Others join in. It is a tense moment. I feel shaken by the anger but remain strong and do not respond. (later, I wake up enough to hear a woman's newscast story about a man who hates gays with lots of anger in it.) (197 words)

["Big bug invasion."] A good looking man and I are attracted to each other. I am wearing a bright yellow dress with a skirt that flows and swirls. I prance around with joy and enthusiasm. We are in a cow pasture. The man has a cow. And I look at it startled because it can't seem to stand up right. It must be sick. The man and I approach it to help. It falls over and huge beetle like bugs come out of it's mouth. They might be infectious so I prance around and keep them corralled with my feet so they can be examined. Later I am twirling and dancing around the man. (111 words)

["Finances lost."] I'm working in an office. My job is to keep track of the money bag and finances. I have lost both the money bag and a financial calculator (which looks just like my TV remote control.). I am searching my desk and the shelves above it. Everything is a mess. Food had been left out and small bugs are all over the place. I find other things that look like the calculator, but it's not the special financial one. Finally I find it. I am so happy and relieved. Then the secretary whose desk I usually put the money bag finds that. I am glad that wasn't my mistake. (109 words)

["Future."] I am on a work team perhaps military. We have a site to examine. Things to study. We find things from the 27th century. And some earlier centuries. We are documenting what happened in the past. The team works well together. Both men and women. It is a modern space ship interior. (52 words)

["Back to work."] I am trying to get my forms filled out because I am returning to work at the community college. Bonnie is with me. I have to find a counselor to sign the forms and I have to sign them. I look for where the signatures will go and finally find them. There are two important meetings happening at the same time. A women's organization and an all staff meeting. I am torn as to which one to go to. Then as we enter the auditorium, it was decided by others the all staff was most important and the other meeting was canceled. I see Theodore and ask him to sign my form. He does so. (115 words)

["Bathing with Ginny and Ernie."] I am in a bathtub, which is very big, maybe two bathtubs side by side. Ginny and I and another woman are in the one tub and Ernie is in the other. Ginny and I have our bras on but otherwise, we are naked. I think about taking off my bra so it won't get wet, but decide it would be too embarrassing. We splash around and talk. Then we get out. Now we are dry and dressed. I am looking for the right papers. Young people Charla's age are around. A 13 year old boy wants to dance with me. He keeps trying to distract me from my searching of the papers to get me to dance. I half heartedly do a few steps with him, but I am still concerned about finding the papers. (136 words)

["Social commentary with fun."] I am in some building with a group of people. A class or maybe a dormitory area. I am working on a writing project for class. Perhaps I am editing. I show someone how to do it. Then there is a playful sort of skit going on. I watch as a woman plays a seductive flirty woman with this good looking man. I then take over this role. As I am doing it, I make the usual give and take of favors too broad and the director, a man, comes into the area to tell me the woman isn't a prostitute, after all. So I laugh and don't actually solicit money, just car and house and stuff a wife would get. It's a comment on the monetary relationship of sexual relationships. (131 words)

["War and airplane crashes."] I am in a war. I and a man have captured enemy soldiers. We are seated maybe in a building out in the field. I have a hand gun trained on one of the enemy and the man has a hand gun on the other. It is a long night and we begin to feel sleepy. I am nearly asleep and the enemy slowly moves his hand and rests it near my gun hand. I roust up and say We've got you covered. It's a close call. Later I am outside and looking up in the sky. We are in the hills near LA. Airport. A huge plane covers over the hill and I see the huge underbelly of the plane as it is landing. Another comes over and as I watch it try to land it suddenly jerks around and I know it is going to crash. I watch as it does crash breaking apart and into flames. (159 words)

["Hesitant romantic start."] I was invited over to a man's house for dinner. I feel shy, maybe he will want a relationship or more specifically, sex. I find him in his garage area behind the house. I walk in. We chat. It is Conrad. He is making a garden. Then he lays me down on the rows to be planted, and kisses me shyly. I kiss back feeling hesitant and unsure if I should. Will I like this? It is too soon and he will want more. But the kisses are sweet. He seems to feel my hesitation and stops kissing and we chat in a friendly manner. Later he excuses himself for a moment. I wait looking around at all the junk and stuff in the garage. Finally I go out to see where he is. He had gone back into the house, where as I walk in, I realize his wife and children live. He gives me a look to indicate that I should be discrete. I feel embarrassed. Later there is another man, perhaps Gaston who is showing me children. They are going to ride in a wagon with seats that are decorated like flowers. I call them the flower children. They are cute. (204 words)

["Traveling to a party and computer connections."] Dovre is going to a party later. I am walking back down a road to the house to change and then join her on the trip to the party. I decide to not bother and start walking back to where Dovre is. I see my father's VW bug (yellow) on the side of the road and realize there is a toddler little girl in there waiting. The motor is left on, idling. I am concerned and ask the girl to turn off the key. My father shouldn't have left it running. The girl finally does it. Then a friend, perhaps Shannon comes down the road. I realize I had left her behind. I try to make up for it and tell her where we will meet for the party. I have a map. I point to the fossil resort across the state. We get there. Now it is like an Ricardo and friend are going to an important party where venture capitalists may be. I am trying to dress to go there. They burst into the room as I struggle to get my bra and fuzzy sweater on. My breasts are exposed and I duck down behind the bed as we talk. They realize I'd been left behind and want to represent me at the party. I am confused but grateful they will not forget me entirely. (227 words)

["Charla goes to Catholic school."] Charla and I are in a large gym like classroom. I am visiting because she will be transferring soon to her new school. Charla wants to wear an odd outfit to the new school and is telling the teacher about it. The teacher is trying to gently explain how it is not appropriate. She also wants to walk over there and the teacher doesn't want her to. As we are leaving to go to the new school, Charla says she's glad the teacher agrees with her. I try to explain that in fact the teacher was trying very hard to tell her that she did not agree with her. Charla didn't really hear it and thought I had misunderstood the teacher. I feel frustrated. I think about taking the van there but we end up walking. I wonder if it is too far and will tire me out too much. We get there and we have to find a 2nd floor classroom by noon. It is almost noon now. I find a flight of stairs and see no elevator. I know there must be one around somewhere, but decide to walk up the stairs in search of it. I am frustrated and tired and concerned about being late. We get up there and realize the elevator is on the other flight of stairs and now must walk down the church pews as we are in the church area of this catholic school. As I step from one pew to the next as they are the stairs I notice I am wearing black spiked paten leather high heels. Hard going in those. One of the pews is very deep and I have to hang on and swing down, reaching with my toes for the next pew. We finally get down to the 1st floor. We walk down a hall and find a chair lift down yet another flight of stairs. I am tired, we are late. Frustrated. I see an office area. I ask how to get to the classroom. She says Admin./Registration and points to the office area. We go there. I look in an office door and see a counselors office. The name above the door indicates it is testing office. A very tall, perhaps 8 or 9 feet tall woman is there. I stretch my neck as far as I can to see her. I ask where the Admin./Registration area is. She points to a booth near her. There's the admin. pit she says. I go there and a nice sweet faced grandmotherly type woman comes out. Perhaps a nun, but not in a habit. She looks down at Charla and says well, what a very nice outfit you are wearing. I look and see she is wearing a cap like I wore in the 1st grade or younger. But it has leopard fur (fake) in the inside. It is a cute bonnet like a baby would wear. Her skirt is 1950's like as well. I like the woman she is gentle and kind and accepting of Charla. She welcomes her to her new school. (517 words)

["Accepting the dysfunctional man."] A man and I are attracted to each other, but he is very emotionally dysfunctional from all his traumatic past. I work with him and help him be more emotionally healthy. We hug and I say to him, "I'm glad you can visit in and out for the rest of our lives." Meaning he and I will have an on again off again relationship as he dips back into dysfunction and pulls back out into healthy relating. That seems to feel fine with me. (84 words)

["Bonnie won't rehearse."] I am preparing for a presentation. Bonnie is supposed to play a character in the presentation and Sharon is supposed to get the food ready for the buffet. Both show up together, late. I am trying to explain to Bonnie that she needs to have her lines memorized. She doesn't want to do that. She wants to carry a sheet of paper with them written on it. I explain how that will not be professional and besides it will make the show not as good. She just doesn't' want to do the work involved to do it right. Meanwhile I am trying to show Sharon the map of buildings across the street where she needs to go to get the food for the buffet. It is Paul M.'s deli. She can't seem to get it. I walk with her and am still talking with Bonnie about how much better it would be if she'd rehearse. I find a deli counter at the community college and see Paul R. I ask him where the other deli is and he says why bother, he has everything here. I try and ask him how much and know it would be wiser if I went over to the other deli to comparison shop. But I am tired and decide to just go with what's here. I feel bad about not checking it out. He says how much were you going to spend? I say maybe 200 dollars. He grins and says no problem I can do that. Maybe it will be 250 dollars. I know this is coating me more, but I don't check it out. I then go out into the hall, trying to find an elevator to get other to the next building without having to take the long way around. I can't find it. I stop into an office where a man and a woman are necking and flirting. I interrupt them and ask. They don't know where it is either. I am frustrated because this will make me even more tired.

["Puzzles and plants for Xmas gifts."] I am making Xmas gifts for everyone. It is nearing Xmas and I only have one done and am working on the 2nd one. I am taking a long time to find each piece. Then I notice I have the puzzle mostly done in sections. I lift up one section and it fits in, almost completing the puzzle. I am glad I figured that out. I decide to give my mother a plant I find a brass planter and start searching my plants for one to transplant for her. Most of my plants look wilted or not very decorative. I finally find one that will do. I carry all this into another room. I give one present to a woman. I point out all the characters are individually written up. She is pleased I went to that trouble. It is a piece of long big paper with squares, one for each character (like in dreams, I guess.) (157 words)

["Friends and business don't mix."] Bonnie and I are at work. I am returning to the community college to work. Theodore is there. As I am preparing, Jerome calls me into talk with him. He is very friendly and I am surprised. Then he begins to tell me all about his business on the Net and how some of these would be helpful to me. I realize he is simply trying to sell me something. I am disappointed. (73 words)

["Am I being prudish?"] Ginny and Ernie are there. I am seated on a couch. Ginny starts to talk to me. I see Charla to the right. She is completely naked. I am shocked. Ginny is trying to tell me that I am being prudish about this. I say but this isn't right. Charla has sexual abuse issues and you are persuading her to feel comfortable about being sexually vulnerable in public. Ernie comes and sits on the couch by me. He and Ginny are trying to convince me it is my prudish attitude that is at fault here. I am shocked at them for encouraging Charla in this way. I am nose to nose with Ernie. He has a round metal tab on the end of his nose like the Tinman in the Wizard of Oz. He doesn't approve of my attitude. I try and explain that this is exactly what I am trying to minimize in Charla's life, the tendency to dress sexy and attract sexual attention. This is a harmful behavior for Charla, I say. They are obviously in disagreement with me. (181 words)

["Watching Bill Domhoff dream."] I am in a house that doesn't really have walls I remember. Just furniture. It is supposedly my mother's house. Bill Domhoff and some of his graduate students are there. A woman grad student suggests I watch Bill Domhoff as he sleeps to see the REM movement. So Bill gets up from the dining table and goes to a bed near by and lies down and immediately goes to sleep. I lean over his face, which is in profile, to see the eye movement. The grad student is leaning over him on the other side. She says see? I look and the eyes are moving. I observe this three times in quick succession. Then the grad student and I return to the dining table where I see a chart with the three eye movement sessions marked. I notice they are each different. I point that out to the male Freudian bearded man in a black coat. Perhaps a lawyer or scientist. He says each is a representative of different types of dreaming. The first one has two lines that go up and down like a stock market chart. The second one has a single line. The third one happens as I look at the chart. I can feel the complexity and depth of that one as it happens. It is a full dream. The 1st one was a short dream and the second one was a fragment. I look up to see my mother in the kitchen. Cooking. Bill joins us at the table. I suggest we go out and have lunch. He must be hungry after his work. He agrees happily. He is very hungry. I am surprised actually because he just ate breakfast not too long before. I go into the kitchen and ask my mother is she cooking dinner for us? She sighs and says yes of course. Isn't she always? I ignore the guilt trip and say when will the dinner be ready? She says around 5 or 6. I return and tell Bill dinner will be ready by 5 or 6. Just so he'll know what to expect. He says great. He still wants to go out and have lunch. So we all go. (369 words)

["Writing down dreams."] I am writing frantically, before I forget the dreams. Bill Domhoff is standing near the couch. I want him to explain his dreams to me. But I want to write down the Bill Domhoff dreams before I forget. He waits. He and the grad student are chatting. I try to concentrate on writing the dream. Then I realize I'd already written down this part of the dream and get confused. I'm starting to forget all ready. I have a number of papers and the dark black ink smudges and I forget to label the page numbers. I write part of the dream and run out of space, because another previous dream was on that page. So I'd turn the page over and continue writing. I am aware It will be very confusing to go back and read it. (138 words)

["Meeting foreign men."] A nice fatherly man is helping me figure out how to do things. He will share his E City newspaper with me if I pay half the bill for it. I agree, then forget to bring my copy for him to read, as I had promised. I feel badly I didn't remember. Then I am swimming and enjoying it. Then I am at some gathering and being introduced to three men. Max, from Japan, another one and someone with a very long hard to pronounce name from Russia. I am accurate at naming what country they are from based on their names and appearance. The Russian is a grump. We are standing in front of a square cart where Japanese foods are on it. The fatherly man shows me how to go from one side to the next and get small appetizers. One bright red thing I say looks like cranberry sauce. He smiles and I say Don't tell me! I don't want to know. He agrees it would be best if I didn't know what the food really was. I see ham slices and say oh good. Something I recognize and like. It is important to do things in the custom of the Japanese so I don't offend anyone. (210 words)

["Take care of yourself!."] I am at some group event, like a conference or retreat. I arrive and my things are very messed up. The children have been into my suitcases. I see my camera out of its case, and papers messed up and so on. I sigh. I try and put things back together. Now the next event is beginning. We are gathering to go down a path near a river. A woman counselor comes over to talk with me. I am distracted with gathering up my things. She challenges me to let go of that task and really pay attention. I acknowledge that that is a good thing to do, but I have trouble doing it. She asks me what I felt when the children had messed up all my things. I (as I continue packing) say I know you want me to get in touch with my feelings and that would be a good thing to do, but I am busy. I am also aware that I am deliberately distracting myself so I don't do the emotional work. Now I am going to walk up a dirt path, uphill. I agree with the counselor that I have options. I can ask for help. I practice calling out. I need help. Then I realize I could have asked someone to come with me and help me, before the problem arose. I walk up the hill, with no help, thinking about things I could have done to have help. The counselor tells me a plane will come to the river and asks if I will be afraid if this happens. I say no, I'd love to take that side trip and be in the plane. But I've got to go now. There's not enough time. She smiles at me. I decide I will examine all the people pictures and this will help me put together the messing up incident better. This will help me understand how I am avoiding feeling my feelings at the moment. But I am interrupted by children wanting to see the pictures, and a man who is getting physically close to me because I am wearing a swimming suit and am looking good in it. He is attracted to me. I am surrounded by all these people distracting me. I gently try to keep the pictures in my possession, but the kids keep picking them up and looking at them. I can't concentrate on what the pictures are showing me. (411 words)

["Everything needs repair."] I am in an apartment. I am looking at the rooms. I see two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a narrow closet like room with a toilet in it. I am telling my mother that I have 2 or 3 of those. It is odd the door is so narrow I can barely squeeze in to use the toilet. My mother gets in fairly easily. The walls are that old bumpy plaster from old houses. In bad condition with bad colors on it. I look in Charla's room and see her bed is missing. I remember she has it in my room as she usually does. Later, I am in the living room. I want to organize and clean. I see piles of things all over each piece of furniture. I am tired of the disorganization. I see some shelves high on a wall but as I look more closely, they are thin old wood boards that won't hold much. I need more space. In the living room, I sigh and say to my mother, I wish this was cleaner. I leave the room and come back in. My mother is seated in a round 1950's kind of chair. She has rearranged all the furniture. I am impressed. It looks like I have more space. There are two dining tables. One rectangular and normal. The other round and black. But the top of it breaks off. Now that needs to be fixed. I see a curtain like a hospital room curtain. I look behind to see what mess might be stashed back there. Not bad. Pretty clean. Now I go to the back door and try to open it to step out on the back porch balcony like things. Some young men are hanging out there talking. The hinges on the bottom half of the dutch door break off. I work at repairing it. It breaks again. The stops I put in the hinge are pink and gooey. I give up, going in, shutting the top part of the door. Then I shut and lock the regular door to keep those young men from coming in. (357 words)

["Dwight needs class in sex and love."] Ginny and I are at a conference or vacation. We have one more night and day to go in this swank hotel. Ginny decides she's done and wants to go home. She sees no reason to stay the last night and spend so much money. I am frustrated and annoyed because I am enjoying being in this swank hotel. But she really wants to go so I acquiesce. I tell myself I must control my frustration and anger for the sake of the friendship. I choose not to, say anything then. Now we fly home. At Ginny's house, I am aware I forgot to give my used ticket back to the airplane personnel. I want to do things right, so I ask Ellie to take me back to the airport and I will try and fix this mistake. Ernie comes through the room and says he's really proud of Dwight. He's struggling with difficult people in his life (his wife Corinne). He is going to counseling and one of his tasks is to watch a movie on Sex And Love With Difficult People. I'm kind of glad I don't have to watch that movie. It might be racy and embarrassing. I try to be proud of Dwight and respect his courage, because Ernie does. Now Ellie and I are at the airport. I remember leaving a folder of papers here. I look to see if it is still there. I look on the top of a pile of papers on a desk. Not there. Then I see a long table where I had put it. Luckily, it was still there. I pick it up and look for the ticket. I don't find it, but I find a script and a wig that I need to return to Dwight. They are his and I borrowed them. Then I remember I left the ticket in my purse and find it. I feel good and pleased that I managed to fix all my mistakes. I feel good about myself. (336 words)

["Dwight overworked."] I am cleaning up stuff, organizing the outside of my house. There is a large pile of firewood in the front of this house. I decide to ask Dwight to help me move the firewood to the side or back of the house. I also want to buy some steel pipes and have Dwight stack them as well. Dwight complains to me that I am expecting him to work and do these things for me without even asking. He feels used. I had never even thought of that as a problem. (91 words)

["Magic children."] I see an image of individual children up in the sky like a picture of a constellation. They are colorful and are placed to form a picture of what I am not sure. Moon, stars, something magic. I look at it, feeling happy to see it. It is a full circle filled inside with the children in different positions. The children are all standing but the direction of the image is different. (72 words)

["Will I or won't I?"] I am at some festival. There is a platform with a roof but only one wall. It is where lots of people are sleeping, in sleeping bags and blankets. No furniture. I am curled up with a bunch of people. There are lots of us. We wake up. It is morning. Lots of people get up and leave. I am still sleepy. Others move away to give more room. I am all alone now at my spot against the end wall. I am lazy, enjoying the sleepy time. I roll over and lay on my tummy. My feet facing the wall. On my left, a lovely dark skinned man comes over. He is attracted to me. I notice I am bare breasted. Wearing only a short pair of cutoffs. I look sexy. He comes over and looks. I am aware he is attracted. I like that and I am concerned. I don't know if I want him or not. He is good looking, but I hesitate. I roll over on my back, exposing myself to him. I curl my arms over my breasts shyly. He comes closer and slowly kisses me. I like it, but I still hesitate. I don't kiss him back much. I think well now he will probably go away since I didn't respond well. He stays. He kisses me again and then I begin to be sexually warm and excited. Then another man, a white man comes over. He also is attracted to me. Which one shall I choose? I am unsure. It feels nice to be so good looking and to have these men attracted to me. Because I can't decide, I move away from the one dark skinned man, whose skin is now only lightly tan. I decide to get up and see the festival. I put on a white sexy halter top with the cutoffs. I am looking good. I walk leisurely out to the festival. This is fun. (326 words)

["Loving solitude."] I am in a store where candles and pretty glass things are sold. I am maybe 30 something and good looking. Healthy. I am wearing cutoffs and a short top. I have decided to live my life as a wanderer without possessions. To travel light. I have a small light guitar to carry strapped on my back, like a minstrel. I look at the neck of the guitar and notice the large wide neck. I try and will it more narrow so my hands can manage it. I go outside it is the beach. I lie own on my tummy in the sand. Enjoying the lovely day. A good looking man comes over and sits with me and we talk about writing. I decide to show him how I do it. So he and two children walk toward my new house which is built in a secluded part of the beach far away from other people. as we walk, the beach trail/road is covered with vegetation and we keep walking through it. Then the sandy road is visible again. Now we are in a car, sort of 1950's sedan. I drive. We arrive at the house and I pull up in front of the double garage to the left of the large spacious log house. Dark rich woods. We get out and I go into the garage where all the animals I help heal up are there. Lots of baby pigs pink and cute, and black and white spotted are there, in hay nests in a row. A baby chick is there. I pet it. The children love being with the animals. The black and white one limps badly from his old wounds I healed him up from. So they have residue problems from their health problems. They are happy and free of pain here with me/. I take the man and the children around to the front of the house the porch is long and wide, a wonderful place to sit and think. I go into the living room where the room is filled with furniture wonderful old fashioned overstuffed couches 3 of them and round oak tables dining tables like Grandma Maude's stuff. 3 or 4 of them. Now I go into another room light and airy and show the man about my writing and music. (388 words)

She finally gets ready and we begin to leave. The performances are just now beginning and we will miss them. I insist anyway. We go to the edge of this indoor water channel. Across it is a performance beginning. We pause to watch it. It is a special effects extravaganza with fireworks and odd creatures dancing out a run way toward the water. A black and white zebra striped animal. Rolls around in dance sequences. Too bad we are going to miss the shows but I have already decided to go home, and by God, that's what we will do. We slip into the glacier blue, warm and very calm water. We silently swim through this smooth water. All is silent. We swim to the next door which is our home. (226 words)

She brings me an example of her special meals she prepares for occasions she is hosting. She shows me a plate with three hot-dogs spread out like a fanfare of three trumpets. A guest would put their lips up to the edge of a plate where the three hot-dogs touched and kiss it. Then the guest, (a child) would look like a heralding angel. We walk down a spacious hall toward the sitting room. Before we enter, she shows me another plate where the hot-dogs are now a kitten grown and trained to have short bowed legs. The kitten has a biscuit coat baked on so it is shaped like a hot-dog. We are expected to eat this kitten. I feel unsure of doing this. Patricia is quite proud of her special skills as a hostess.

["Audience so far away."] I am giving a lecture to a university audience in Australia (down under). It is outdoors and I am standing on a high cliff to speak. The audience is far below. I actually only see small painted academic people in bleachers. The live audience is in the front rows and they are the children of this elementary school. I can't really see them they are so far away. I pace on the grassy verge of the cliff and keep walking over to the edge so I can get closer. I am talking warmly and passionately about good ways to reach and teach young children. I am frustrated with this long drop off and distance. I stand right on the rocky edge and peer over as I speak, but then I am afraid I will fall over. I walk back on the grass, away from the edge. Finally the speech is over and it is time for the reception. I eagerly go inside the building to the room, my hotel room. A woman in a business suit comes in and I shake her hand. I am happy to meet the people I just spoke to. Many men come in. Now the room is crowded. I am conscious of using my best power hand shake and am smiling because It is fun to receive the complements and gifts. Each person brings a gift, mostly books. I like the books. Lovely hard backs on subjects of interest, mostly psychology and Zen and stuff like that. I open a package and find a plastic wrapped set of scrolled bamboo and cloth material. I exclaim at the lovely colors, copper scrolled bamboo mat and dark blue and copper design on the cloth . The Asian woman is so happy I like her gift. Now a man from Australia leans near me. He brought a book to me also. He is attracted warmly to me. I am writing down each person's name and address as I receive the gifts. I make a small mistake and write his name on one line and his address on another one that s slightly off, down one. He really wants me to mark it so I know that the address is attached to the name. I draw a box around them to link them together. He is happy. I ask again about the numbers. I see some numbers there already and he asks what they are. I say it is a shadow of some one else's numbers and mark it out. We are sexually attracted. Now the scene is the next morning and I watch as these two are dressing after having had sex last night. She has a red mark on her breast, like a spider bite. (Like Anastasia's on her forehead.) She says oh dear, I don't remember if we used protection last night. He is concerned as she is. They neither can remember. She says well, we'll just hope one or both of us used something. He insists that if she is pregnant he must be told. She says I will test myself by observing if I feel pregnant. Then I will have an abortion, of course. He is upset. He wants some say in this. She says you don't actually think I want to have your baby? (551 words)

["Charla doesn't like my nagging."] I am at a neighbor's yard, looking at the garage sale items. I see several single beds I consider. Then I find a trellis with a pretty plant growing on it. I buy that and go down the street to my house. I hang it up on a wall of a garage there. It slips and falls, catching on a rough spot on the wall. It's OK there. Then I see Charla has broken the plant up into small pieces. I wonder if the plant will die that way. The purple blossoms are pretty. I am sad they may die. Then I ask Charla to go to the store with me so we can have a chance to talk. She doesn't want to go. I am annoyed, saying fine, then I'll go myself. I walk down the street, coming to a steep downhill with snow on it. I skid to a stop and back up, just in time to avoid sliding down the hill. I turn left and walk up that street. I can't find where I want to go and don't really know what street I am on. (189 words)

["Grandma Anne loving and giving."] I am in a house, talking with Grandma Anne. As we chat, she brushes her long thick grey hair. I remember the time she asked me to put her hair in pincurls and I felt so uncomfortable. I wish now to brush her hair as we talk. She is loving and wants to know how I'm doing. She gives me an antique dress, with an elastic waistband. It is long, white and pretty, with ribbons on it. I try to figure out how many years old it is. Over 50. I think the dress will be too small for me, but it does fit well. I look good in it. We spend hours talking about family and old times. I really appreciate this information and the openness of her. Then a man with a broad face comes in. She introduces him to me. We sit at the table chatting. I think Grandma is trying to set us up as a couple. We chat pleasantly. (164 words)

I'd been there for a day already. Dora comes in. I am very happy to see her. She says I've really missed you. I say me too. Dora suggests we spend a day together. I agree. I suggest Thursday.

["Looking good!!"] I am in a crowded school room. I have piles of photos I have taken. I am going through them and organizing them. It's fun to find my art photos and look at them. There is a young man near me who is attracted to me. I find a box with sweaters and tops in it. I see them and think they are too small for me. I put one on and discover I look sexy and thin. I am pleased. Now I am trying to leave the building. I weave through the crowd of students. Another man is attracted to me and follows me. I stop to wash my legs, one at a time, I am wearing a mini skirt, possibly leather, and boots. It looks sexy and it intrigues the man. Now I am carrying some photos of mine and a baby. The man is questioning me. Whose baby is that? I want him I don't answer him. I seem to be hanging on to the mystery as it makes him more interested. I walk to a small house which is the day care center. I ring the doorbell. An oddly shaped doorknob which is almost like a tiny stick starts elongating. I know the door is being answered. It opens. I hand the baby to the young woman and say its name Bobby Baker. It is the baby of a friend of mine. Now I leave. The man following, he's very excited about knowing more about me. (250 words)

["Stock market crashes."] I am in a room. The stock market has crashed. People are financially ruined. It so happens I didn't do stocks, so I have cash and I decide to buy stocks while they are very cheap and make a fortune. Then I am trying to wash some clothes in a small washing machine. I can't get the side door to shut correctly. The water I am pouring into the machine starts to slop out as I run the machine. The machine falls over and breaks open. I pick it up and fix it. Finally it is working correctly. Now I am showing a book I wrote to a man who is showing me his book he wrote. I think his is about music. (123 words)

["V. house remodeled."] I am in a house that seems to be a remodeled and enlarged version of the V. house in A City. I think Susie owns the house. I go into the bathroom and comment that the toilet has been moved and shelves added but it is the same configuration as the original. I look in a mirror and am startled that I don't see me. I see Susie's reflection. Only it doesn't look like her either. Dark short hair, greenish blue eyes. I see this reflection several different places and am confused as to why this is my reflection. Now I go from room to room looking at the changes. Now I think the house is Aunt Millie's. The rooms are light, large and airy. Book lined walls. I go outside and come toward the house down the dirt driveway. On the right I see expansive fields, well cultivated and a row of filbert trees along the driveway. They are in bloom. This is what's left of the filbert orchard. I see the front of the house and a long wing expanding from it. I walk along the edge of the wing exclaiming on the lovely patterns in the stone wall. I see large windows and bookshelves behind glass. Old antique books, lovely to look at. At the end of the wing I even see bookshelves with books on it outside. I say they must be old unwanted books if they are left out in the weather. I am very impressed with Millie's remodeling of the old house. (258 words)

["Helping man dies attempting to save the other."] I am watching a woman (me) painting the wall an off white color. All the pictures, many of them, just like my photos are on my bedroom wall, are still up and she is painting between and around them. I think that's stupid. She will regret it later. Then she starts on the next wall and I see a mirror with a reflection of her previous room she painted. I see her husband also there painting, but she had allowed him to sleep in even though she herself is very tired. Three rooms are done like that. She notices she accidentally painted on hardwood windowsills. She decides to wipe it off before it ruins the natural look of the wood. She tries to hide the paint covered paper towel she used to wipe it off so her husband won't be upset with her. Then she sits, tired and he comes to her and tells her to finish. She says she needs a smaller brush for the trim. He shrugs and says go get one at the corner market. She doesn't want to. She doesn't answer as her attention is caught by a man standing on the edge of a roof across the way. She sees him through the window. Then she sees to of them. One is trying to kill himself by jumping, the other one is trying to save him by catching his arm and holding on to him. Several times the man jumps and the other catches him, each time it is scary and she gasps. She is irresistibly drawn to the window to see the whole thing. She wonders why, as she would hate to actually see him splatter on the ground and die. On the third jump, the second man loses his grip and the other man falls to his death. The woman gasps, turns away and cries deeply at the tragedy. Because as the one man jumped to his death, it caught the other man off guard and he too fell to his death. It is ironic and tragic. She cries and cries. (348 words)

["Student cries rape."] I am a teacher in a middle school. My class is large and noisy. Another woman teacher left her class and is sitting in on mine, for the fun of it. I am trying to figure out what lessons I am supposed to be teaching. English, possibly Math. It is not very organized but OK. Now the next class comes in. A much smaller class. All girls. I check my lesson plans. Looks like English lessons. The work "is" is being examined. I try to call them to order. The woman teacher is as noisy and disruptive as the girls. I call her to order and she smiles and quiets down. Now I ask one of the girls to do a speech. I decide this is speech class. She can't think of anything to talk about. I suggest she wait and let it come. Well, suddenly she begins to sob and tell us the story of her rape. She is a black girl now. I feel great sympathy. I go to her and hold her caringly and hug her, rocking back and forth. I feel sadness for her and I feel proud that she is talking about it. (198 words)

["Uncaring distant people."] I am in a huge gymnasium. A man and a woman are walking across the floor. Their cobra is with them, slithering with her head up high and hood extended. She is huge and impressive and scary. Now I see the man and a woman sitting together on the top bleachers. It is night and they are sleeping. A metal basket with a lid sits beside them maybe a few feet away. Inside that is a huge cobra. There are electronic red lights flashing on the lid. There is a mean man out on the gym floor the snake is afraid of. She stays inside the basket even though it is overheating and she is dangerously overheated. The couple decide they want to make love. There is some hesitation because the snake is near, but they decide to do it anyway. Later, I am on a couch on the gym floor with this cold distant man. He is going to stimulate me to orgasm. He impassively sticks his finger up my vagina and moves it around. I concentrate of the feeling and go for orgasm. It is devoid of loving feelings. Now I see some disk jockeys in a room. The man is one of them. He is lying on the floor writhing around in emotional agony. Silently. Another man says well, it is better this way than if he screams. The door suddenly opens and the cold man's father, "Big Daddy" comes in. He gives the man a left over peanut butter sandwich, even though he just came from a sumptuous feast himself. He then hands him an old pair of his pants, way too huge for the man. I use red thread and sew some stitches on the waistband to try and make it a better fit for the man. (302 words)

But it frays and so I am going to snap it apart and do that part over again. I am amazed how hard it is to break. It stretches and stretches until it is one tiny thread, hanging on. Howard offers to help. I say, stubbornly, I can do it. Finally, after struggle, I break it. Ellie is talking about going back with a previous boyfriend. I am upset with her for even thinking it. She mentions a man's name. I say don't you remember what he was like? It would be stupid for you to go back to him. She has curly short hair. She is adamant she will go back to him. I disapprove.

A man puts another video in the set and another interesting movie comes on. I don't want to miss the one that is on TV now as I like the story but I am interested in the second one too.

Outside. Mitch R. is there, also. Then I see tornadoes in the sky in the distance. Danger is coming. We rush to the barn to find a safe place. In the barn, I look out and see my mother and Grandma Maude outside concerned about housekeeping duties. They are preoccupied with getting the tasks done and won't come in to safety. I suggest we find a below ground area because the tornado could smash the barn and we'd be hurt. So we find a cement square hole and crawl down there with lots of other people. I call a warning to my mother and Grandma Maude again. They won't listen. The tornado strikes, breaking the barn to pieces. We remain safe and cuddled together. (260 words)

I am attracted to him. He is funny and fun to be with. We enjoy each others company. He is showing me a trick where he pours water into a pot of dirt and puts seeds in it. The water is slopping over the edge a bit as he pours. It is very runny dirt. As I watch, I notice we are in a banquet room. I decide, since this trick will take a while I'll go to my place setting and have dinner. I wear a lovely blue velvet gown, like Katie in the play. I wander down a hall to another door and go in. I see the place where my dinner should be. I don't have a chair. I go to the other side of the table and start to take Woody's chair. Then I see the nice man I'd been flirting with had moved a chair there for me. I sit. He is seated on my left. We chat pleasantly, still flirting. I feel slightly uncomfortable and point to a picture of Woody in the newspaper and say My new husband is this man. This is to alert the man I am married and I am proud of the fact. The man says he is an unstable selfish man. Did you know that? I say yes. A woman says he is a freak, always doing things differently. I say yes. That's what I love about him. I am unshaken in my enjoyment and love of my husband, even though I have to admit he is as they said. (296 words)

["Teaching Nancy how to run the disabled students department."] I am working for the Disabled Student Services. It's one of those endless rooms with a corner desk and a couch with acres of floor. I am listening to tapes of student phone calls. From the answering machine. One is angry and complaining, the other is pornographic. I sigh, feeling frustrated. I don't want to have to listen to the pornographic one. A co-worker is asking my help with the boss, Nancy. She is behaving like a dictator and micromanaging. I keep asking Nancy questions to help her see what she is doing. Nancy is upset with me because I am pointing out her faults. I am attempting to help. I am also angry at Nancy for not being more caring with her employees. A male student comes to me as I sit on the couch and says they need a salmon colored marker to make a sign. I look for one in a large clear plastic bag I have. Lots of colors, but not that one. I then give him some quarters and dimes I found on he bottom of the bag to buy one and then give it to me later as it is my personal money I am spending. The co-worker is upset that I have spare change and she doesn't. She isn't paid very much, I guess. She is jealous. (224 words)

["Lucid dream about dreams meaning."] I am at a big computer machine. It has flashing lights and lots of buttons. There are two machines now. I used to only work with one. I am getting close to finishing the project. Now one machine sort of becomes a vehicle. A VW bus. I am trying to drive it up a hill. The road is like the rumpled bed covers, quilts. I am having a hard time getting on that road. It is all uphill and not very solid. I finally get the bus on the road. I beep the horn. It sounds like a regular car horn. I beep again. It has a different sound. Finally it beeps a vw sound. It is a struggle to get to the top of the hill. Now I get out of the bus and start walking down a flight of stairs. I am indoors now in a stairwell. It is wide and roomy, with occasional open doors leading into rooms. I am looking for one for me to live in. I walk many flights around and around down and down. I get to the basement. A large old dilapidated room. I am not impressed with it. People are sitting around on old couches. I suddenly realize it is a dream. I can change things or do what I want. I decide to ask these people what do dreams mean. I do so. The people seem stupid. One woman mumbles the community college. Several others slowly mumble something I can't understand. One says "27." Then two more sentences that excite me because maybe this really is the meanings. But I forget what he said immediately. I desperately try to write them down so I won't forget them. Can't find anything to write with. (293 words)

["Can't read the feedback."] Judy P. sends me a big envelope. I open it to find she has after all these years returned scripts I had given her to critique. I am excited. I see she has written lots on the front covers. I try to read them. I can't make it out. I think it's too dark in the room, or my eyes are going bad from old age. I see some spots of sunlight on the bed and move the script there so it would be brighter. That doesn't work either. I see one script is called "Hughley's" and another one is about penguins. I see she has tried to illustrate the penguin story. I see penguins with pink crayon on them. the word "Cold" is there. It is winter and it is cold. So she decided to illustrate the penguins in pink to indicate spring and warmth. (146 words)

["Quilts."] I find some quilts and remember that I had made them a long time ago. One has autographs and sayings written on the back. I look closely and see that I had asked people who had used the quilt to sign the quilt with comments. I look at them trying to see what they said. I am in a large nearly empty room. A young girl, maybe Caroline as a child is there. She is crying. I say to her sympathetically, come here and I will hug you. She shakes her head no and walks away from me turning her body away from me. She doesn't want to be hugged. I respect that and continue sitting on the floor, watching her. I say again Can I hug you? She nods her head sadly and walks hesitantly into my embrace. We hug for a long time. Then she moves to indicate she is done and I release her. Then I stand and I am dancing contact improv. I pick up a small boy in my arms like he is a puppy. I balance him and dance slowly around. He wants down and I put him on the floor sill curled up in a fetal ball position. A man is outside the open door and wants me to go out there on the porch with him. I go outside in the bright sunlight. (231 words)

["Volcano and swimming."] I am near S City. There is a very steep mountain across the large body of water. And a back murky pond and a narrow channel of water near a house. I think the house is supposedly my parents'. I drove there in my van. My job is to be prepared if the volcano on the mountain blows. I must pack my own things, get them into the van and drive to safety. So I don't really unpack. I just use what I need and put it back in the suitcase. I seem to swim a lot. I dive into the back pond and swim laps. It feels good to be exercising. I swim up the narrow channel as well. I see under a board like a shed wall with a gap at the bottom and see a cat looking back at me. I had wondered what the other person had been looking at. The channel narrows so much and gets so shallow I am practically swimming in mud. It empties out into the large body of water. I think about swimming out there but the water looks rough. Then I see the volcano has erupted. Spewing red lava down the mountain side. I am wondering just how many miles the lava can go. I can't decide if it is safe to stay here or if we should flee. I keep looking at the lava flow. Lots of steam in various parts of the mountain. I decide it is better to flee. I walk to the van and get in. I drive away. (263 words)

Then the woman says she is going to serve the pancakes now to the group waiting outside. She asks me to continue cooking more pancakes. I say yes and pick up the spatula. I turn the pancakes over, having fun doing it with flair. The man chuckles and enjoys how well I flip the pancakes. (160 words)

Perhaps the radiation is survivable now. I gather up the important supplies and open the door slowly carefully looking around to try and remain not seen. (170 words)

["Retiring from teaching."] I am retiring from teaching at an elementary school. It is an assembly where the kids are all seated. Some still coming in. The kids are singing and speaking about how they will miss me. One boy crawls up on my lap and we hug. Then I release him to his playmates. I get in front of the audience and tell them goodbye. I shall miss them very much. Even though I am retired, I will come and visit them and do some activities with them. I think I am going to Hawaii. I feel like crying but I also feel happy. Lots of love going both ways. (108 words)

["Velvet yellow and green keys on accordion."] I am on a bus like a city bus. With family (only I don't know these people in real life.) The bus is very crowded. Many people crowd on. My mother has to stand. Dovre is there. A small girl who is mentally retarded and is related is there. I see "video" pictures of family gatherings. I see my face all angry and upset because she leaned on me and it hurt. I see some other similar scenes of unhappy people at family gatherings. I comment that oh well, sometimes it happens. No family is perfect. Life goes on. The girl wants my attention and I reluctantly give it. I am standing up and amazed I can do so without pain. I am starting to feel tired. The girl has an accordion she used to play I stroke the velvet keys, yellow and green they are. I show her how to pick out a tune. I like the accordion and want her to give it to me. Dovre is shocked I would take it from her as it is an important memory thing for her. I am a bit callous and figure she won't miss it for long. I look out the window and we are traveling down a narrow one lane road. The trees almost form a tunnel exactly big enough for the bus to get through. I see large black animals with huge snouts and tusks. I call out to "Dad" and say look at the pig dogs. He stretches in order to see out the back window and sees them. We are passing through an old town, maybe one I know. I look for landmarks I would recognize. Maybe the old house we used to live in. Now I'm at "home" and unpacking. A piece of round moss from Dovre, some old ballet slippers and I put these things on a shelf in a bowl to keep them as keepsakes. I am trying to show Dovre I really care. (332 words)

["Wanting Drew Carey."] I am in a house with Drew Carey. I want him sexually. I arrange some pillows from a cupboard on the floor to make a comfortable resting place. I take off my clothes and lie down, waiting for him to join me. He doesn't come to me. He chooses to lie down on a bed in another room. I get up and drape a white towel around me and walk into the bedroom. I catch him trying to run up the stairs to avoid me. He feels embarrassed. I ask him to explain what's going on for him. We lie down on a couch. Our heads at opposite ends as we talk. He says he feels uncomfortable jumping right into sex. He'd like it better if we talked a long time and got to know each other. I agree. I tell him I think he is intelligent and I enjoy the creativity he shows. He seems shy. I touch him on the leg as we talk. (166 words)

["Finding a spacious room in my house."] I live in a tiny house. I am telling a woman who works for me where and what plants to trim or work with. There is a huge colorful cricket on one plant. It is very cute. White, like it has a satin tuxedo on. The woman uses a paper towel to pick it up. We walk across a hall into a courtyard. She releases it out there. I walk into the courtyard and walk around it in amazement. I didn't know this house had this. It is spacious, enclosed, a room and lovely. A brick fireplace, a high window where I look back out at the courtyard and see a high window and lots of big pretty plants there. When I lie on the couch that is my view. As I walk around I find three or four different pianos and organs. They are all broken. One doesn't have any keys. Another, an organ will play but it's out of tune and vibrates oddly. I really like this room. I wonder why I've lived so long in the house in the ordinary cramped rooms and not out here. I decide to move in immediately. I imagine nice fires in the fireplace.

["Van is stolen."] Dovre and I are talking on a cell phone. I am standing outside near a freeway. I am trying to return home from S City. She asks where the van is and I look and see that Michael K. (new dreamer in group) is stealing it. He turns right onto the freeway, the opposite direction I need to go to get home. I try and run after him, calling out, stop. Hey. He stole my van. I turn left and run down a rutted dirt path. It is hard to keep up the pace. I am growing tired. (98 words)

["Beautiful garden and burnt backs of houses."] I am in a house. I slept the night with the daughter of the house, a younger friend of mine. I am trying to help her out. We are up and talking with her father, a very good looking well built man. The woman says she is a lesbian. I am a little upset, thinking I'd wished I'd known that before I slept with her. I feel nervous. Then I tell myself I'm being silly because there was no sexual part of our night. I am aware that I am prejudiced about lesbians and feel guilty about it. I let it go. Now there is a needlepointed sign or banner over the window. The name of a society that helps mentally ill people. The Philo-something society. I am interested in this because of the woman. Her father is going to get her signed up for this society. I notice the fee is $70,000 to join. I know I can't afford it for me, but hopefully I can attend as a helper of the woman. I decide it is time for me to leave this house. I am attracted to the concert going on in the house across the street. I walk into the room and sit, listening to the small built man singing. I like the songs very much. The man gives me intense eye contact as he realizes I love his music. He and I are attracted. He finishes singing and I get up and walk out of the house. He follows me asking, "Do you hear that lovely sound?" I say yes. I love the sound of rushing water in a brook. He says do you smell the flowers perfume? I say yes. It is exquisite. He says come look at my beautiful garden. I walk along the side of the house to the back. I see an elaborate pattern of huge roots intertwined. It is very beautiful. Like a wrought iron pattern. Circles and intertwined figure eights.. Then I get on a swing and swing back and forth across the back yard which is a smooth shallow pond. He joins me and we swing together. We get off on the other side of the pond and stand at a stone wall which marks the end of his property. I say to him, I see that the ordinary world lies beyond here. It is not pretty. We look back to the back of his house. He says it doesn't look good. I see that the walls have been burned but the pattern with the left over blue paint and the blackened spots are beautiful. I say no, it looks pretty. The house across the street is the one that looks bad. It is badly burned and charred. I then see the woman come out all dressed up in a formal dark dress and a bun hairdo. She's ready to go out on the town. I am concerned. I say to the man I have to return and help. He follows me as I swing across the pond and walk to the other house. I go in and find the extremely good looking father lying naked on a couch. He wants me to join him. I say no. You have a beautiful face. Your body is beautiful. You are intelligent and kind. But you can't share your feelings.. I bring his daughter to the couch. They sit facing each other. I say she's leaving because you can't share your emotions with her. I try to assist them to speak to each other. The singing man watches, waiting for this to be done so we can go away together. (609 words)

["Beautiful eclipse."] I am in the old Mac house. I step outside to see the sky. It is mid afternoon but it is as dark as night. I see clouds, dark and black, then the night sky with many stars. I step off the porch and turn to see the eclipse. I remember that to look at one with the naked eye could be damaging to my eyesight. I see a round darkened sun with three or four sparkly lights where the moon is beginning to move from the edge revealing the sun. It is beautiful to see. I comment on its beauty to my mother who is standing on the porch. I see leaves and their shadows on the house front wall and for a moment think that is the eclipse. (130 words)

["Weird cake."] I made a cake. I am frosting it. This is for some special presentation for a group of people. The loaf cake breaks in two or three pieces. I place it back together and spread the chocolate frosting on the top. Then I drizzle some extra chocolate on the top of the frosting. It makes a pretty pattern. Then I have more frosting left, so I begin to plop big blobs of it on the cake and ruin the pretty look of it. However, it does have lots of chocolate and tastes great. (93 words)

["Grandma Maude and Grandpa Lee are ill."] I am setting up a shop where items made by people with disabilities are being sold. I have many small colorful knick knacks on the wall for display. People are coming in and looking around as I am setting things up. A small girl is left unattended by her mother who is outside looking at things. I see she breaks a small doll. I take her hand and walk her out to her mom and lecture the mother about leaving her unattended. I ask the mother to pay for the broken item. She is annoyed with me. I walk back in and now see there are two or three rooms. I explore each one. Pretty furniture, lots of things on display. The colorful items remind me of bright yarn dolls made by Guatemalan Indians. Now I am in a room where Grandma Maude is resting on a couch. My mother sits near her. I see Grandpa Lee sitting in a chair on my right. I hear Grandpa Lee making a clicking sound with his very fat tongue. He is ill. I then see Grandma Maude has slipped off the couch and fallen on the floor. I realize I am the healthiest person in the room, which isn't saying much. I find it ironic. I struggle over there and roll her gently back on the couch. She is thin and sweating. I am concerned for her. She is also very ill. (240 words)

["Swimming the river of grades."] I am visiting Charla at school. Only the school is outdoors. Each grade is on a different side of the river. I must cross the river to talk with each grade teacher. The 5th grade is at a shallow part. I can manage that one OK. The next on I need to go to (6th grade is up stream and it is very deep. Perhaps waist to chest deep. I am afraid of it. I decide to go back two grades and see that teacher. I look in the river and see it is a dug out "lake" very deep like a swimming pool. I hesitate jumping in. I explain I am afraid of deep water. I then say Oh, to hell with it and jump in and swim a few feet to the edge and struggle to get out of the steep embankment. Now I go back to the 6th grade teacher. Charla and I sit down after cross the river. I say to the teacher I need to explain something about Charla. Charla cries out, annoyed, why do you have to tell everyone? Why do they have to know. I say its to help you out. They can work with you better if they understand. Charla pouts and then says Ok, but I'll tell her. She says its a cross between hypnosis and...I begin to choke from a throat seizure (and wake up.) (235 words)

["Finding the river."] I am in a wheelchair. I am trying to cross a street because I want to see the river. I am going to write a book and the river tells the story. I look to my left across the street and see a restaurant on a hill overlooking the river. The perfect place to write the river story. Two or three other people join me. Another person in a manual wheelchair. We go up the hill to the restaurant. The others go in first. I see a right turn into the restaurant from the hall. It is a tight fit because a blue piano is by the door. I tell the woman at the door I can fit. Just barely. We wheel in and go to a table right in front of the window. I stand up to see better. I see a small river with beautiful trees on the banks. I am very pleased with this river. It is exactly the right kind. It is smaller and shallower than the main river I first saw. I sit to begin writing. (181 words)

["Talking about Charla."] I am talking with a woman. She and I are friends. It is a pleasant talk. Then I am dressed in a short brown skirt and nylons. I am young and thin. I sit on the floor. I am talking with the woman and several men, like Chuck and a nice man are listening in. The nice man comes over and sits beside me. He is curled up comfortably very close to me. I like him and would love to cuddle with him, but I am aware that he is married. He asks me how old Charla is and I say 14 years old. Then he asks how is she doing. I explain that she has trouble because she has a chemical imbalance. He is sympathetic for her and for me. He then comes close and brushes something gently away from my eye. I at first think he is trying to kiss me. I lean into it, wanting it, then I pull back because it would be wrong. He looks at me, wondering what I'm doing. I smile apologetically. We continue talking in a friendly way about Charla. (188 words)

["Moving to another house."] I moved into a new house. I rented it furnished. I notice the TV is small and old. I ask Bonnie who is helping me move to bring my 32" TV from my bedroom and my other TV as well. She agrees to help. I walk outside to check out the neighborhood. I see a restaurant where I can eat pancakes and syrup. As I come out I see it is next door to the public library (which looks like the Old MM City library.) I am very happy about this. I walk a few more blocks to find the street I turn left on to get to my new house. I try to see the street sign in order to remember what the street name is called. I am remembering how to get back to my house when I leave it. (142 words)

["Ocean bites our butts on the couch."] I am visiting someone's house. We are outside. Bonnie has asked the owner of the house if she could keep her plants there for awhile. She is there to visit them and see how they are doing. I look out and see the ocean quite a ways away. Bonnie and I greet each other. Then I see a wave coming toward us. We are surprised and begin to run toward the house. We are going up a very steep sand dune and Bonnie is on her belly flailing away. I am crawling. It is hard going. We struggle and barely make it to the open carport. We sit on a couch and the wave comes right up to us. Even spraying us a bit. We are very surprised. Now Bonnie is stirring a huge metal bowl full of figs and nuts. She calls this an orchard mix she made. Sort of like a cookie dough. She looks at her hanging plants. Someone isn't taking good care of them. (168 words)

["Selling dreams."] I am in a room where a presentation of various dream product sales people are preparing to sell their wares. They are all seated in two rows in an alcove and then in a raised bleacher thing up on the wall. Two women were standing on a raised platform near the ceiling. They were signaling to the audience with their wares. Finally, I get up on the alcove stage area to start the show. A big wall keeps appearing to my left in front of me which obscures the audiences view. I think it out of the way but it returns several times. I tell the small audience that I will begin the show. I will give each salesperson a chance to sell their wares (this surprises the women) They thought they'd have to sneak attention. Then I point out a wall of small dream products and say contrary to what it looks like, we aren't just here to sell dream products. We have a good show for you. Later, I am seated in the audience, waiting. A bathroom is down a step in a hall. I will it to be accessible on the same floor level. It changes. (199 words)

["Murdering my family."] There are two of "me." We are like twins. Pretty, young, blonde. I am the hard working counselor. She is a psychopath. She wears sexy clothes, I wear conservative clothes. She puts her baby, child and husband in a deep snow bank and shoves them under even deeper. They are freezing. There are odd squares of "snow" with imprints of some design on them. I or she keeps moving them aside. Then she pulls them out of the snow and puts them in a coffin like crate. She feels some guilt. She could take care of them now and they would be safe. But she shrugs her shoulders and leaves them in the crate, dragging it into a house and hiding it in a couch. Some little girl, a neighbor is there and helps her. She doesn't tell the little girl they are burying people alive. She leaves them there to die, still feeling some twinges of guilt. Now she comes in search of me. She takes over my body. My clothes transform into a tight angora sweater, nylons and a short black skirt. I am now her or visa versa. She walks the halls of my school where I work and causes problems for people, not caring anything about them. She laughs. Now she (me) and Charla are walking, looking for a bathroom. We find one. But a woman is in the stall and it is messy and stinky. She/I walk back out saying it is too stinky and we will find another one. My mother comes to us and says why were you doing (something). She is suspicious of me now. I sign, annoyed, because I am going to have to kill her again. I take a picture of a tiger on a black background. I decide to keep it and take it to my room which has opaque windows and a door with a clear glass window in it. The paste or glue is on the picture side, so I place it on the inside of the door window. My mother asks me what I am doing. I ignore her. Now Charla and I are walking down a street. I look up and see a square cloud with very well defined edges. It is moving very fast and it is dark. It is headed out to sea. I watch with interest. Now it is an odd square shaped boat/plane flying back in. I go aboard it and I see a man. He is very attracted to me. As he approaches, smiling and preparing to give me a line, I pull out a golden pistol and shove it in his face. I am going to kill him. (449 words)

The storm is upon us. I hesitate, almost dash down to the basement and at the last moment dash upstairs. The two elderly aunties are lying in a bed moaning and groaning in fear. I run to the window. The sky is completely dark. I see a fireman being sucked out the front door through the window glass. I am sure he is dead. I realize that "Dad" and "brother" are dead. I see the sky clearing.

Then walking over to another actor. I say stop. That's not quite right. I need you to say more and wildly pull at your hair. I keep thinking her name is Mary, not Mirabelle. Then I look out the window and see Ernie in the driver's seat of a dark green beat up VW bus. I laugh and say where did he get that? Ginny says a woman gave it to him, because he is ill and goes to Boise to see a special doctor (Dr. Arquette). I see then that Ernie looks plump and not well. I am glad to see him. I haven't seen him for along time. I hope he feels better soon. I wonder for a moment if the doctor was mine in S City. (164 words)

The long tables in the dining hall are covered with dirty dishes. I come in and say someone should clean this up. Everyone just ignores me. It's too big a job, overwhelming. I'm cheerfully picking up a plate and a fork and go to the sink with them. I fill it with hot soapy water and begin scrubbing the dried food off the dishes. It is hard work but I continue cheerfully to do the dishes, one at a time. I keep asking people to help. I make jokes and try to make it fun. After awhile, someone starts helping. We playfully make a game out of it. More people come and help. Now everyone is helping and things are getting cleaned up. Sorority women come in and are disdainful. We ignore them and look like we are having fun. (Because we are!) Soon, they help too. Then a punk teen boy says he's not going to help. His clothes are dirty, so I grab him and wash him like I'm hand-washing clothes. I am vigorous and the poor guy yelps as I thrash him around in the sink. I see lots of filthy water come out of the clothes. That will do. I say, and release him.. Now he's willing to help. (238 words)

["Dangerous waters."] Doug and Lydia, Dwight, me and Charla are at the beach. We decide we want to go out on the ocean on a boat. I am apprehensive. The waves seem rough and big. We start out through the surf. I keep asking Doug if we have extra gas on board, because we would not want to run out of gas. He says no. Then I ask if there at least some oars on board. In case we run out of gas. I pick one up and begin to paddle. Now we are out in the deep water. The boat is being pitched around by the large waves. They become larger and rougher. I am worried now. I want us to turn around before we'd gone too many miles and run out of gas. We begin to turn the boat around. Charla falls overboard. I am frantic. I can see her sinking under the water. I turn the boat back around and paddle like hell to get to her. I call to her. She seems unconscious. I reach down and grab her hair and pull her up. I get her on board. She isn't breathing. I begin CPR on her, begging her to start breathing. She chokes and becomes conscious, breathing. Thank God. I am relieved. Then I look up and see a huge tidal wave coming at us. I scream. We frantically force the boat to go as fast as it can toward shore. The wave will engulf us. I anticipate how horrible it will be to hold my breath. Maybe we will survive, maybe not. We finally manage to get back on shore, alive. (275 words)

A curtain is pulled across the left portion of the space by my desk. A man stands behind the curtain. I can see his outline and the yellow suit coat he is wearing. I am not fooled. It is Drew Carey. Someone tells me they are very pleased with my video project and will buy it but I must edit it down more tightly. In particular, the ending segment. I am happy they like it and assure them I will be happy to edit it. I know it needs it. Now I am looking at a survey Lucy has filled out. I read her answers and decide I will answer the same way. I notice she checked on the SEX question that 50% of the time she has sex alone, 40% of the time, sometimes with people and 10% of the time she has sex with someone.

I need to ask some of them to help out. I look for one called Jennifer to help. As she is one of the more helpful ones. Neal sees a spill of dried food on the blue shag rug. He goes over to help clean it up. I am pleased he seems helpful. I want the presentation to be well done. I want Neal to enjoy the potluck party. He seems to be having a good time.

["Inadequate, false."] I am sitting on a couch. I am waiting for a woman director who will work with me on a play. I have the lead part. A man named Kent comes over and sits near me on my right. I am distracted and not real friendly. Suddenly he leans over and kisses me on the mouth. It is a french kiss and I don't find it very interesting. Boring. He is trying to talk me into having sexual relations with him. I am confused and stammering. I am trying to tell him I don't want to with him. I am trying to say his style of asking for it without relationship or love doesn't work with me. Then the woman director comes in. I get up and abandon Kent. The director says she hates false over acted love scenes in movies. I agree. Then she grabs me and pushes me down on the couch planting big over acted false kisses on my cheek near my mouth. I am very uncomfortable, her breasts and mine are pushed together. I want to push her away. I try to go along with the pretend acting and say I know what you mean. Then they writhe around. We pretend to writhe around. Finally she lets go of me to my relief. Then Dovre comes in the room. She just woke up and wants my attention. I tell her, her hair is messy and then, distracted, I abandon her too so I can pay attention to the director's directions. A man director comes in now. He tells me to act some lines. I start. He stops me saying I am not giving it enough passion and action. He mimes for me the gesture of a fish hook catching in my mouth and me writhing like a hooked fish as I deliver the lines. I think that is ridiculous and over acting. Then the woman director says she wants more from me. I try to explain to her that first I need to memorize the lines and then I play with them adding the intensity and emotions. I feel very inadequate. I must have failed. I feel incapable. She does not approve of my methods. She tells me she is disappointed. She had heard so much good stuff about my skills. My reputation had preceded me. Now she is unhappy with my ability. I feel terrible, inadequate and a failure. (404 words)

["Bathing Grandma Maude"] I am working on a project with my computer. I have lots of work to do. I am worried about how the files will transfer from the old style to the new. I am in an office, like at a college. I am distracted by other people needing my attention. Apparently Grandma Maude is very old and fragile and needs a bath. I am distracted but interrupt my work to give her a shower. It is hot. We walk into another room, like a separate cabin. I turn on the shower head on the wall. There is no shower stall or curtain. I pull up a stool for her to sit on. She walks in, naked and not as old or fragile as I thought. I tell her to sit on the stool but she sits on the floor, her legs folded in a lotus position. I am amazed she is so flexible. Her hair is long and flowing, dark with streaks of grey. I shower her and spray myself, even though I am clothed, as it is so hot. Now the shower is done. My mother is on her knees on a couch, singing "I wonder if I have been abused." Over and over. I am a little annoyed at her and also glad because if she is willing to ask questions and check things out, then maybe I'll finally find out if I've been abused. (237 words)

["Living on an island."] I live in a small hut on a tiny island in a river. The river is flooded and raging. The only way I can get to town is to go hand over hand up a rope tied to the high embankment. I shinny up the rope and crawl through a plastic tarp hiding my entrance. I am in a backyard of a friend of mine. He steps out the back door and says Hi. I ask if his wife is in. He says yes and I go in to visit her. She has built a pottery studio in the house and is busy working on a new piece. I watch her as she is burying a pot in the ashes of a fireplace kiln. Another hot kiln is roaring in an alcove next to the room. I tell her I like her studio and the fact that she built her special space just for her artistic needs. She is going to give me a pot as a gift. She steps around the corner into the living room. I peek in and see ordinary couch and chairs and so on. She hands me a lovely pot. I thank her and go back to the entrance and shinny down the rope to my island. I am approaching the hut and become concerned that someone dangerous is in there waiting for me. I enter cautiously. Sure enough, there is a man there. I pull out a yellow shotgun and point it at him saying back into that corner. If you try and escape I will shoot. I dial 911 on my cell phone for the police. He smiles and pretends to sit up straight or stand up. He is deliberately baiting me. I am poised to shoot. I don't want to kill him, but if I must I will. I warn him again that he had better sit still. At the last moment. I point the gun at his foot thinking I'd just wound him, not kill him. I fire one shot, then reload one handed, quite skillfully. We wait for the police. (350 words)

["Rocking out to sea."] I am being shown a special boat the loggers use on the river as they log. It's a rocker boat, a sort of raft with very high sides made of planks, like an old fashioned hay wagon. It is built to rock back and forth, sideways with the weight of all the logs they gather. I am on the boat and we are going out to sea. At first, we have a hard time getting across the beach to the ocean. I think it is odd we are on land and trying to move in a boat. I look up and see a huge cruise ship on the horizon of the land. Perhaps it is docked past the rise of the dunes. The scene is very dark, I can barely make out the shapes of the sand dunes and rocks. We finally struggle out to sea and cross the surf breakers. It is still very dark. I am seated to the right of and slightly behind a good looking man. I am trying to light a cigarette. Only all I have is a roll of money. I peal off a bill and light it. I puff away and then realize it is a 100 dollar bill. I blow it out and look for a one dollar bill to smoke. The man watches. He lays his arm around me, as he is attracted to me. I am attracted to him as well. I find a paper fake bill like a coupon and roll it up and light it. Suddenly a man behind us screams sharks. He is looking out behind us. I feel fear. A large shark roars up onto the raft with his mouth lunging at us. Then they are all around his. We turn and head back to shore. We are in danger and are running for our lives, only we are a slow moving boat. We dock and swerve to avoid being eaten. Finally we get back on shore, one shark still trying to follow us up onto the sand. I am afraid. (345 words)

I grab Charla and her backpack and drag her along the road to the bus stop. I keep saying You'll miss your bus. Now get up and help me. Charla dawdles along. Sure enough as we approach the parked bus, other parents are driving their kids there. and I mutter to myself. Be there. Still be there. We're coming. I hated the idea of spending the day with Charla in her mood if she misses the bus. But as we get close, the bus does drive away without her. Now I am really angry. We begin walking back toward the house. I whimsically decide to continue on down the road, since we're out. I notice we are in the sort of desert area, like in Nevada. A rough expedition is forming to take people out into the desert and see the sights. I decide I want to go. It would be fun. I go up to the male guide who is standing by a jeep like black vehicle. I say, Here's the deal. I want to come on this trip but I don't have the right clothes or equipment. I don't even have shoes on and am in my pajamas. The man laughs at me. Then he becomes thoughtful and gives me a set of papers and says read this. I look at it and see it is an elaborate code. I casually read out a few words as I begin to understand the code. I see target and nuclear and buildings. As I say these words, the man realizes I can break the code. So he says OK, we'll get you the right equipment and you can come with us, but your job will be to read this code. I agree, realizing this is important military stuff. We are now in the vehicle and I am driving up a very steep sandy muddy road. I am having fun squirreling around in the mud. The man is observant and impressed with my skills. We crest the hill and I look down the steep road and see in the distance the lights of a big city, like Las Vegas. It is very beautiful. We go down the hill. I am using the brakes. Charla wants us to go fast and I say that's too dangerous. I read somewhere it is a delusion to think it'd be fun then you get too fast and can't stop. I ride the brakes skillfully. (436 words)

["Scam artists at work."] I am the owner of a gas station/cafe in some small town. I am also working on some project, making something. I have a huge back room that might have once been a factory. High ceilings, row lights, large windows on the left and many rows of long tables. I come in and notice that it seems dark. I turn on the lights but it is not enough for the detail work I will be doing. I am frustrated. Lydia is there and I say to her I need to figure out how much money I am making in this business and what is selling. I think maybe nothing much is selling. I don't even think I have any employees in the front working the cafe. I look out the front window and see a woman sponging off some merchandise on racks. Oh, maybe I have one. I should be supervising her. I lie down on a table while Lydia and I are talking. I stretch my legs out across the couch next to the table. I realize my mother is sitting there and I apologize if I made her uncomfortable. She smiles and says no, not a problem go ahead and rest them on me. Then I say to Lydia maybe I should change this business and sell what I love doing and what people want. I suggest chocolate desserts. Lydia reminds me we already tried that. She baked them and worked as waitress, but nobody bought them. Then I suggest a book store. I ask Dwight if this town already has a book store. Then I see through the window that two twin girls are spraying water with a hose and ruining things. I quickly go out there and as I walk toward the girl, she sprays me. I determinedly walk to her and take the hose from her. She is uppity and I tell her she's in trouble now. She laughs at me and says maybe the hose was stolen and maybe it was mine. She runs outside to the car where her mother and father are. I chase after her. I see the mother and demand her name and say I will sue her for the damages. I lecture her on how mothers are responsible for supervising their children and she wasn't doing that. She is smirky and sassy. I demand her name. She laughs and gets into the car. The Father comes out and I ask him her name. He says her name is Balboa, spelled boacea. Her middle name is baby eyes, spelled baby ies. I search for a paper in my pocket and find one already written on so I try to find clear space to write on. It is difficult to do. I ask for the phone number and he says the newspaper, boxes between 0 and 12 and you must call at precisely 8:00 or it won't work. By this time I realize they are scam artists and aren't giving me valid information. I try to read their license plate number on the car and remember what they look like to report them to the police.

I walk on down the path, looking at groups of people hoping to see her. I come to the building and can't find her. I am concerned now. I go into the building which has a huge sort of open wall rather than a door. I can't see her. I turn back and go outside hoping to find her there. I decide to wait there looking as I have the best view of the whole grassy area there. I am worried we won't connect and feel bad I let her out of my sight. (189 words)

["The test."] I am taking a written test with a class of younger people. The teacher says it is an open book test, so I am lying on the ground with the textbook open and writing down a paraphrase of what I find in the book. The teacher comes around and sees this.

I can't seem to let go of using the book. Then it starts coming more easily. The answers won't be as thorough as in the book, but they will be my own. (119 words)

I slide down and manage to get on the beach. I am happy. I look around and travel in circles on the beach. I see some other people get stuck in the deep sand and I decide to head back before I get stuck. I find the path which is now a stairway ladder like thing. I now have to step by step go up. I try 3 different times and fall back down. Then I manage, precariously one step at a time. I get to the top, feeling good about making it. I turn and look at the ocean again.

["Abusing Charla, Howard is mean and I win the boat race."] I am in a house and Charla is being uncooperative. Refusing to help me. I am very out of control angry at her. I slap her repeatedly in her face and shove her around while yelling at her to help me. She just gets worse. I feel helpless rage at her. I also feel tremendous guilt for being so abusive to her. I want to apologize and get her forgiveness. Then Howard is there and I realize we are moving immediately. He is leaving now and I will follow after I sell the house, get things packed up and drive the moving van there myself. He climbs to the top of a ladder. I follow him berating him for leaving me with these impossible tasks. I tell him I can't drive a big truck. It doesn't have power steering or automatic transmission. I say I don't know how to sell a house. He just smiles and keeps walking away from me. Then I realize he means we will move to New York City. I am appalled. That's too big and scary for me. How will I manage it alone? He then jokingly takes off a 1950's petticoat and scrambles down off the ladder, leaving me at the top precariously trying to get down by myself. I get down and am on a wharf or boardwalk. I see a woman in a speedboat racing. In the water. I watch as she tries to make fast turns into wooden gates. Because she is moving so fast, every small movement she makes on the wheel makes the ride jerky. She is an amateur. I get in a boat and race her. Now the boats are like cards and I slide over other cards in the water. I dangerously take the risky way by skirting the edge of the deep water where only half my boat is actually on water. The other side hangs over an edge. I duck and speed around the other cards, sometimes right over them. We are neck and neck. I win by a nose. She pulls out a score card. Her mileage is 1 10th of a mile more than mine which indicates I lost. But I know I won and remember that I started the race a bit after her from a different place which is why the mileage looks like I lost. (395 words)

I hear the questions and the answers from a male contestant. In the middle of it, I decide this is boring and I get up and leave. I walk outside. I immediately notice the buildings as I look at them more closely are very ornate and wonderfully weird. I see what looks like a black and white mural on a building. As I look more closely it is an alcove with moving statues in it. A woman statue looks at me and says MaMa. I stop and watch. She moves and changes into yet another woman statue and says MaMa to me again. I walk on. I turn and look behind me. I am seeing the mountain landscape behind the city in stereo close up.

Sort of data entry kinds of things. Maybe getting orders over the phone. I am walking along a balcony ledge addressing them with orientation information. Behind me are offices where the male bosses are observing me. They like the sexy way I walk and dress. I have a projection screen with the instructions up there and I am giving them instructions on how best to do their job. I tell them that it is fine they are wearing jeans and informal wear at work but each one must buy one dress which they will be required to wear four times a year at work functions. I tell them that any dress will be fine as long as it isn't low cut or the hem too high or too tight and revealing. I tell them the grey haired men who work in those offices will be too distracted with such dresses and you will lose your job. (432 words)

["Abner and Sonja."] I see Abner and his wife in bed. I am interested that he has a book and probably a writing book he uses for his manuscript. I am curious what's in it. Now I see the woman is Sonja and she'd just had a baby. It's like a snapshot of them. I like seeing it. (55 words)

["Silly bathroom rules."] I am at a conference. At an expensive hotel. We have a full agenda of workshops all day. Then we must take a short break and then do an evening workshop too. At the break, I am in my room. Apparently I have roommates, one of which is male. He is seated on the bed as he puts on his shoes. I am lying on the bed as I started to fall asleep because I was so tired. But I force myself to wake up to get ready for the next workshop. He says I don't have to go. Someone can take my name and some identifying information like my driver's license number. He looks at me. I say well, that would be cheating and decide not to help him. I Disapprove of his attitude. Now I am going down the hall to a bathroom. I need to pee. But the security guard stops me. He says just a minute. How many times have you used the bathroom today? I am surprised and say why? He says we have rules. You are only allowed to go at certain amount of times. I look into the large lobby area and see many people lined up waiting for their turn. I am frustrated and annoyed. He tells me to wait in line. I pace back and forth very angry. I say Fuck. Fuck. Over and over. An attendee, male, says why are you wasting your energy being angry? I pause and consider this. I say reasonably, You have a good point. I stop swearing, but I continue to be frustrated. Now I see Maggie, in her wheelchair. They call her name. I say Hi to her as she tries to walk up the stairs to the bathroom dragging her manual wheelchair with her. I am talking with some man on my right about how ridiculous these rules are. I tell him with some pride that I know her. Now I am looking at a brochure of the place and see a snapshot of me, in my polyester blue and white jacket, with my hair permed. Like when I was at the community college. I am surprised. I say oh yes, I remember. I was doing physical therapy at the community college and they asked to take my picture to use in state brochures about this. It is a moving picture like a video. I am seated and I am walking around in the background. Now I tell someone I drink 7 glasses of water a day and need to pee frequently. They show me the schedule. Between 3 and 4 you can pee at 3:08 and at 3:40 and so on. This won't help me, I say. Then I look at my watch and see that it is 8:20pm. I am late for the workshop. I try to decide if I should just hold it and go to the workshop or stay and wait. I try and figure out if I can go to my hotel room and pee there. (508 words)

["Noisy politicians on the radio."] I am waiting to give a speech in a building. The seats in the lecture/classroom are raked. I am listening to the other speakers. They are politicians and drone on and on. It is loud. I go out into the hall. I am gathering up my props and materials. I come back in. It is my turn but the other speakers just keep talking. I try and interrupt and have to talk loudly to speak over them. I am annoyed at them. It has been all day. I am talking about disability issues. Can't get them to shut up as I struggle to get the attention of the audience. Later, I walk down the hall. I am looking at the writings and objects on the wall. I realize I am dreaming and say to myself. I'm in a dream. This feels exciting. I also realize I am in a state close to waking. (153 words)

["Mom and Patricia."] I am visiting my mother. It is a large room in a mall. She is confused about what had happened to her. (hospitalization.) She is still weak. Others try to help her understand, but to no avail. I am looking through a file of papers and find a letter from Patricia responding to a question I had asked her. I am pleased she responded. She had found a grey pair of socks I asked about and sent me a pair, all balled up plus one more a darker shade of grey in case I wanted the darker shade. I look up to see that my mother is dressed in a pink suit and high heels (heals?) and leaving the room. She is in desperate search for something. I hurriedly put on high heels and join her to protect her. I take her arm and we walk side by side. She has trouble balancing in those shoes. I ask her questions trying to figure out what she's looking for. She mumbles and it doesn't make sense. Suddenly, we come to a steep staircase. We are at the top. It frightens my mother as her balance isn't good. She teeters on the edge, then turns and walks back to her room. (209 words)

["George did it."] Someone, a friend (female) died. I am convinced she was killed. I have no evidence. My "ex-husband", a gentleman like Ike Turner is questioning me. He's a cop, undercover, I guess. He is suspicious that I know something. I wonder if he did it. He has a sleek car. I turn to walk away. A young man, very respectful and attracted to me invites me to ride in his car. It's a bright red sexy car. I agree, liking the idea of showing up. "Ike." He will be jealous. When we are in the car, I suddenly realize "George" is the murderer. But I can't prove it. I cagily ask him questions. He now is concerned and watching me carefully. Now we are in a large room. And I am still asking George questions as I look nonchalantly through a box of paper, hoping against hope I find some evidence. Then I find 2 things. A CD George gave my friend and a notebook my friend wrote in. I guess there are coded messages on these and I pull them out. George is getting very nervous now and his eyes narrow as he watches me closely. I tease and bait him like a lawyer until he confesses, because he's convinced I have the evidence. (214 words)

["Mexicans and stealing."] I put some of my things in a car and leave it for some Mexicans to steal. Then I and my companion decide to steal some of their stuff. We sneak into an area to take things. Then I feel overcome with guilt and fear they will arrive early and catch us. I demand we go hide until they are out of here. We go up a level and hide under a pile of clothes. Another family comes in and takes their own things and finally depart. My companion wants to get up and go on. I shush her, afraid we will be found. We finally decide the Mexicans must be done and gone. I get up and my companion wants us to go visit her friends upstairs in the office of the manager. I peek over the edge of the balcony and fearfully look to see if the Mexicans are around. We don't see them. Now the beach area is full of tables and we furtively walk past where they were supposed to have been. I see one of them drinking from a glass seated at the table. I am so afraid of being caught. I hurry past and go up a flight of stairs to the office manager apt. I go to the top of the carpeted stairs but a recording starts. A woman's voice says they are not at home because her husband had died suddenly and she hadn't anyone to help her manage the office so she took the day off. I hurriedly rush down the stairs to get out as we aren't supposed to be there. I am afraid I will be caught. The stairs become raked theater seats and a gap is there. I must jump from one row to another, over the gap. I hesitate. It looks too far to jump. I then step carefully down one row where a lone seat is and then jump. I am successful. I leave quickly still afraid and furtive. (333 words)

I am in a house, waiting in the living room for the social worker to come. We are going to decide what I need. A few women come in and sit down. I scoot to make room for them on the couch. They sit waiting. I look around wondering why we hadn't started yet. And saw 10 or so people sitting around. I am surprised. We are waiting for more to arrive. I notice there are chairs placed all along the walk. I begin to count how many people are in the room. Around 70 people. I am amazed. Why do they need so many I ask the leader woman. She says because we don't know yet what you'll need so we have to have every dept. represented. I scoot over to the left more and am now sitting very close to a good looking man, the supervisor. He smiles and flirts and we chat. He has his shirt off and his hairy chest and back are soft and warm to the touch. I look and see 2 babies out in a carriage. I notice they aren't wearing anything but diapers. I am annoyed that with so many helper people in the room, no one is helping the babies. They must be cold. I walk down the bleachers over to them and try to tuck them in with a small quilt. Now there is some form of entertainment going on in the crowd. I wonder when this meeting will ever start. I try and list what I might need so I'll be ready when it does start. (267 words)

Now I'm sitting at a table in a booth waiting for the 2nd meeting. I see Ellie and Charla come in. A few social workers come in. A man stands by me telling me we need to move over to the booths to make more room for more social workers. I sigh. Here we go again. The man has glasses on. He is also very warm and friendly. He shows me some pictures of him as he was growing up. I see his orchestra picture. He has drawn a box around himself in all the photos so I'll know which one is him. I wish he'd let me guess first. I smile at his boyish face. I see he played his violin. He is standing behind me and leaning in very close. I lean back into his arms and say Did you ever play 1st violin? He laughed and says yeah. Sometimes. I smile. Me too. I say. We laugh at the fun of us having these same experiences. I enjoy him and he enjoys me. (176 words)

["Track star in the rough."] I am a young woman, maybe 20. I love to run. I am running across a track field as a track practice or meet is happening. Just for the joy of it, I am running along the edge of the track and passing the runners. On the track including a car, with ease. The male coach sees this and wants me on the team. I laugh. I can't do it I have a night job at a factory. And my "mother" wouldn't like it. She would be upset. I walk away from him. He and his young assistant drive up to me as I'm walking in a pickup I tell him it won't do any good to try and talk me into it. I do get into the passenger side. He earnestly talks. I suddenly look over to the young man and ask who the fuck he is. The coach grins and tells me his name. I shrug, dismissing him as unimportant and pimply faced. I keep refusing the coach's earnest explanations, thinking how my mother needs me. (She's an alcoholic) and she'd be upset with me. Finally, I get out of the pick up and he stands in front of me and says I'll offer you a scholarship, I'll help you take care of your mother, You can go to college and do what you love to do. Better your life. I am scared to go against my "mother" but this is too good a deal to pass up. I feel attracted to him. He seems kind. I ask him, Are you an honest man? I will say yes. But there is much work I will have to do to assertively say yes and trust. (286 words)

["Moral teachings."] I am visiting in some woman's house. The children are rambunctious and naughty. I am going from room to room trying to coral them telling them to settle down. Don't be so noisy and disruptive. They will not listen. I get into one room where a man is sleeping. He might be the physical therapist. I then see the owner of the house (like Anastasia's friend) who is seated in the garden next to a non blooming bed of roses. She tells me that when the roses bloom, they are poisonous and no one can rent this house until they stop. I am sympathetic on how hard that would be for the owner. I scurry around herding the children into the main room. They keep escaping. Some of their teen friends are on the patio and I ask them to leave. They refuse, laughing at me. I tell one boy I know his father. They reluctantly leave. Now it is time for the priest to instruct me on moral lessons and quiz me. I stand in the room as he lectures. He draws a multi-colored design or graphic on my right shoulder and when he asks me a question, I am to point to the right section. He asks me a series of what would you of if---questions. I have trouble answering. The correct names. But I can explain the basic answer. At one point, my Hawaiian dress is so loose, my breast flops out. I feel embarrassed and try to tuck them back in. Finally I answer all the questions and the lesson is over. (266 words)

One person is lying down with a sheet over them. I lie down too. Later it is time to leave and the other man does everything he can to get my attention. I choose to ignore him again. Time is passing. We are late leaving I gather up some of the plants in their containers. There are several small children running around, having fun. Howard's arms are strong and we laugh at some joke together.

Her youngest daughter looks like Lydia's (Anastasia's friend)'s youngest daughter. She is whining and crying. Like a spoiled brat. I am annoyed at her. I am trying to gather up some things. Then I go into a bar. Lots of people there. I am insulting and yelling at most of them. I say mean things to Charla. Then I go to the Fairy Tale castle. Looking for the city's King that lives there.

["Flying with the pain."] I am lying down and the pain in my foot is tremendous. Ginny is helping to get me on an airplane to fly me to S City. I am watching and I see the tailgate like piece slam down on both my feet, cutting off my right foot. I am in terrible pain. People are aghast at what happened. Now by will of my mind, I am lifting myself up and flying myself around still lying down on my back. I am looking around me and I see buildings that I am skimming over, barely making it over the tops. I see carnival rides I am skimming over and I feel like I'm experiencing a carnival ride. Now I see a country road and I turn left and follow it like I'm driving. Now I'm in a "car" maybe a convertible and must turn left or right. I ask the country singer with me which way to turn. He grins and says you choose. I turn left. Now I'm gliding (still on my back like I'm reclining in a hospital bed, slightly raised.) in a beautiful old hotel and each wing has different blues artists. I love being there and turn down a hall to listen to wonderful jazzy blues music.. A Negro man sings the blues. I am amazed at how perfect the music is and that I am making this music up in my head. It sounds just like I was listening to the radio. I see a ladies room and admire the signs on the wall. It is beautifully ornate, the decor. I concentrate on the wonderful music to keep my mind off the terrible pain. (279 words)

["Lovely new house in the country."] I bought an old large house in the country. Charla and I are moving in. My foot still hurts. Charla and I share a bed in a downstairs back bedroom. I am surprised at myself for having bought the house and for choosing the old beat up back bedroom and for moving so soon after the surgery. Charla and I are talking. She is restless. I peek into another room and see two toilets and a boy sitting at a desk. Apparently the other family hasn't completely moved out yet. Charla makes a sexy rude comment about the boy and uses the word "fuck." I scold her saying that is not appropriate. I restlessly turn on my left side and see a door with glass panes and the backyard. I wonder why I'd decided to sleep in the badly built old back bedroom. I decide to go upstairs and look around. It is a very lovely up there. Large spacious rooms and the view is exquisite. Rolling hills, majestic mountain, an ocean. I can see for miles like on top of a hillside. I am aware that I should be able to have such a view from a country village outside of E City. A children's camp is next door, The kids wear red T-shirts, I think Charla will like that. I wonder why I made the decision so quickly to move, a rash decision without considering things like what Charla's school would be like and where it is. We decide to go see if we can find the school. We walk down a country lane around a corner and an old building there looked like a school, but wasn't. We return to the house. I again marvel at the view. I remember an old woman died recently and willed it to me. I go back in and look over the rooms and decide the room on the left that used to be a formal dining room would be my library. I choose to sleep in the master bedroom on this floor. (342 words)

["Chris Farley."] I am traveling down a side walk in my wheelchair. I see another woman in a weird manual chair. She's starting to cross the intersection and a bus is bearing down on her. I rush to push her across the intersection. She is upset with me because she wanted to go the other way. I smile at her good naturedly and say don't worry, I'll take you back. I push her wobbly chair back across the intersection. Then I continue on my way. I now have a flame thrower and am burning any trash laying around on the sidewalk. I see a young man who looks like Chris Farley. He watches me. He is interested in following me around. I go back the way I came to the office. I work at. I go in and file some papers. He watches intently. (142 words)

["Sci fi scary movie."] I am exhausted and decide to sleep in the small two roomed house, next to my regular house. I lie down on my back on the ugly bed and am so tired. Then I am restless and get up. The place looks like a run down motel room. Blue print cotton curtains all wrinkled and open. I try and get them closed. Everything is a mess. I look out the window and see the little girl laying out a blanket and putting their teddy bears and dolls on the blanket. I lock the front door with chains and locks. I walk through the messy kitchen and lock one of the back doors, leaving the other two open so Bootsie can get in. I had cuddled her for a moment in the bed and she got restless and ran outside. I saw another cat scurry under the back door, so I decided that's how Bootsie came in and left the other two open so she would get back in. I worry about that leaving me vulnerable to burglars or bad guys. I am angry at Ellie for making such a mess. and here I am in the inferior house and she is in my good regular house. Dovre is there. As I am complaining about Ellie making such a mess, I look out the window, It is now dark out and the little girls have gone back inside. I think it odd they decided to set up their "picnic" so close to dark. I go outside to look. That's when I notice the front of the "house" is the driver's side of my van. The door is off the hinges and sitting in the van and a big bashed up area. She'd had an accident and didn't tell me. I am angry. I call out "Joe!" I go back into the house. A young 1950's hood (JD) stands there, Richard, also a young JD who was staying with our family. I accuse Joe "my brother" of messing up the house and wreaking the van. I yell at him, accusing him. I see gopher trails and holes all over the kitchen floor. Mud droppings all over. Joe and Richard run. I accuse Richard who runs up a hill. He's running away because I am accusing him. I realize this is bad, so I call out, "We can work this out. We love you anyway. He hesitates and then returns. Now we go into the regular house where I see my "Dad" an older Italian kind of guy in a T-shirt and pot belly. He invents things and has 2 "products" he is excited about marketing. They are minor silly things but he takes it all very seriously. A neighbor woman, young, pretty and sexy comes in and leans on him, her expansive cleavage showing. My "Dad" and Richard are flirting and staring at her breasts. She has dark hair. My "mother" is in the house, an unhappy woman. I angrily tell the young woman she must leave and never flirt with my "Dad" again. She laughs at me and I threaten her. I force her out the back door. She is backing out teasing me about how I can't stop her. She falls backward into a creek and I laugh and taunt her. I yell watch out for the snakes. There is a lot of green algae there and she screams and is frightened, struggling to get out of the murky water. I laugh at her. I go back in. Joe and Richard are working with my "father." "Dad" is sympathetic of my anger at Joe for ruining my van just after I spent $1500 on a new engine. He will have to work hard difficult jobs for long hours to pay me for the damages to the van. He also has to clean up my house. Then I see a giant tarantula leg walking over me. It is trying to wrap me in a web and I struggle. I realize these giant things are my "Dad's" creation, made to destroy my "mother." I struggle away and run outside knowing they've already killed my "mother." Now slimy snake like things are coming up out of the ground and grabbing for me. I run into my house very afraid. Joe and Richard are working for my "Dad" and now they are searching for me. I hide under a long box (wooden, rectangle). The size of a coffin, turned over me. They are plotting to kill me. Now I the dream "ego" see two of "me" running insanely out to the road and standing in front of an oncoming car which caused us to glow as the lights hit us. It was the police. They ran over us. We died. We were insane and trying to die because of the madness of my "brother" and "Dad" and all those giant snakes and spiders were too scary. (822 words)

["Accept!!"] I am in a hospital. I get up and walk wondering how it is possible to be able to step down on my left foot. I hear a turd fall to the floor from my butt. I am in an open, long room. A nurse and Mabel are there. I decide to use the potty chair but see the screen isn't in place around it. I walk over there and see a red icky mess under the potty pan I am relieved it was someone else's turd that fell. Mabel suggests we go for a walk. I ask again, in surprise, is it really OK for me to use my left foot. She says no problem. We walk out a side door to a weedy messy courtyard area in the back of the building. I see various cute animals that look like possums wandering around. A big yellow bird in a box moves right behind my knees and tries to bump into me as I walk. I am looking behind me at it, laughing at how cute it is. Mabel calls my attention to an owl like bird by the wall with huge glowing yellow eyes. Then Mabel snaps to attention hearing something. I look out the courtyard and to the street. I see some teen girls walking along. One girl is angry at the other. She says, "You shouldn't pick the roses!" She repeats that over and over. I realize it is Mabel's daughter and Mabel runs over to her to talk. I am left alone. A rowdy group of JD's gather around me. They threaten to beat me up. I try to talk them out of it. They force me to walk back toward the back of the courtyard. I yell out "Help. Help." Mabel help me." The teen boys laugh at me. I ask them why they are going to do this! They shrug and say just because I was there. They walk ahead of me. I run away from them back toward the street. I choose to hide myself under a thatch of scratchy bushes. I am uncertain this is a good decision. I rustle around, trying to hide myself. I wonder if I should try to run again. The teens find me easily. They laugh at me. I realize they are going to beat me up. and there's nothing I can do to avoid it so I stoically stand there, chatting with them, waiting for it to be over with. This somehow impresses them and the dream ends without the beating. (426 words)

["Jim Carrey and me."] I am walking down a sidewalk. I am some book store clerk (and not myself.) Jim Carrey is filming a "schtick" and pulls me to him to be a part of it. I mimic his crazy faces. I am very agile and do physical comedy that works well. After the moment is over (one move is that I was pretending to wrap my legs around him and hang on to him and then my feet walk up a brick wall and defying gravity.) After the schtick is over, I walk on down the street, aware I am late for a meeting. I have to have info for. Jim is now intrigued by me and my impressive acting skills. He follows me. I go into the bookstore. I rush around to get the info. A male co worker says hurry. You're late. I hen see Jim buying boxes of books. Books on lots of different subjects. I remember seeing some on boats and sailing. He is trying to impress me. I hurry across the street to a coffee cafe where the meeting is being held. As I go in, I see Jim doing funny movements on the street. I enter the cafe chuckling at his antics. I see a number of long tables and every customer along the tables turned, staring out the window at Jim in curiosity. Then they pretend they aren't interested when they see me come in. I find my meeting group in a window corner area. I begin talking to a Mr. , the boss who will be angry I am late. I say I've already written as book script for a movie (It's title is "Back To Win.") I work hard to convince the boss not to be angry at me and to make the book into a movie. Or I am pointing out it was a popular movie and I wrote it. I am very articulate and persuasive. (323 words)

["Tap dancing with Ellie."] I am living in a small cottage. I am learning tap dancing. I cheerfully challenge Ellie or she joins in as I do a riff. She'd follow my rhythm and we enjoyed doing "dueling tap dance routines." We were doing this on a small narrow cement sidewalk just in front of the small cement steps and porch in front of the house. We were waiting for the arrival of relatives to a reunion we are hosting. Now I envision a narrow cement sidewalk up the middle of the lawn. We tap up and down that. I am making up new steps and rhythms. Heel, toe, flop flop, etc. I see an odd convertible sports car driving up the road and stopping in front of our yard. No one is in it. I am quite surprised. Then another car drives up and at first I think it is Patricia but it is her sister Suzanne in the passenger side. She is using a remote control to drive the cars. I am amazed. She parks the cars a bit crookedly. More relatives visit. I go into the house. One of my Aunts calls me over to a table with many small jigsaw puzzles laid out. She smiles and gently challenges me to try to put them together. My mother had been doing it and just went outside. I shrug and sit, looking at the pieces. They are white background with simple black line drawings of various zoo type animals. I find I can do this. (253 words)

["Red haired rapist."] A red headed man sneaks up to my bedroom window. I am hurt, lying in bed and realize he is a rapist. I grab my phone and call 911. I can't remember my address. I say I am within a quarter mile or a hundred yards of a state park. It feels like the same location as the reunion dream, but not the same house. He comes into the house and talks to me, telling me to let him have sex with me. I try and fight, pulling his hair hard. He threatens to hurt me more if I struggle. I am trying to fight hi off and also aware I'd want to have sex. These feelings are within me. (120 words)

I have returned from someplace with an injury and now I must sleep up on the roof of a small cottage. I am lying on the narrow flat part of the roof. I am uncomfortable. I have a slim blanket and no pillow. I am afraid I will, in my sleep, roll over and fall off the roof and badly injure myself. It is miserable. I have to be there until I heal. I in desperation look around for a safer more comfortable place to sleep. I stand up, although it seems I shouldn't be able to. I look out and over to the next small cottage and then my "parent's house." All these are owned by my parents. I walk over these roofs looking for a better safe place to sleep. I don't find anything. I walk into my parents' where I used to have a room. I see a man and I think it is my brother Dwight. I suspect he's leaving and I call out to him You'd better not leave without saying goodbye to me or I'll be upset. He hesitates and returns to sit in a chair near where I lay. He confesses he's decided to leave his family. I suddenly realize it's not Dwight but some other man. I say, "I know" and he says How? Did you call my nephew? I say no. I didn't do it. I am relieved it is not Dwight's and embarrassed that in my pain, I didn't recognize him. He had black dreadknot curls in his hair. Lydia does some math calculating to try and get me to stay in my room rent free. She shows me the figures. I don't believe it is possible that I can stay without cheating. (293 words)

["Going to school again? Why?"] I live with my parents. I am downtown "M City." I have decided to take a college class of math at B City College. I need to take a test at Voc. Rehab which is at the post office. I have to get into a crate area that is the elevator. I crawl over the rail to get into the barred area as it is moving. I see Betty Cat is with me and I hold her as she snuggles. I must remember to tell my mother she's wandering off clear downtown now. I get to the basement. A man is there working and pays no attention to me. I call out to him that I want to take the 7 hour test. I need to take for that class. Even as I say this, I am wondering why I am doing this. I remember signing up to do high school again and then didn't go to classes for that. The man tells me I can do the test on Tuesday or Thursday from noon to 5:30pm. I sigh, and decide to do it now, as it is Tuesday. I don'' want to do this, but I'' doing it anyway. I hold my cat and cuddle her. (207 words)

["War ships and music."] I am seated close to an ocean on the sandy beach. I see warships like USS Cole plowing through the waters. I like being so close to the water since I can't walk to actually BE there. I am glad I can see so closely. Now Charla comes and disrupts the sand. I withdraw some distance, unhappy to have to move away from the ocean. I have a guitar and am trying to play it. Another person has a different type of guitar. I try to show them how to play it. Unusual set of strings. Ones more like a bass guitar. I enjoy plucking out rhythm and melodies. (109 words)

["Nate makes me sad."] I am in an unusual world. A sort of Saturday Market, only with secret entrances to another level. Only certain people can use the secret entrance. I am standing at a chicken wire kind of fence. Looking out, away from the Saturday Market area. A tall man in a black long hooded robe. It has orange colored squarish designs. He stands very close to me. I turn and look at his face. It is Nate. I want to touch him and hug him. I lean toward him but he shrugs and turns and walks away. I feel great with sadness. Again he leaves me unsatisfied. I feel longing and sorrow. I try to shrug it off and go on. I walk up an odd wall where the second to last square is the secret entrance to the lower level. I step into a swirling funnel and get sucked down to the lower level. A cop tries to follow me but can't get through. The entrance would not accept him. (169 words)

["Soft sweet flavors and sweet emotions."] I am in a cafe sitting in seats like in school. A waitress sits on my left. I am trying to write her a complement letter. Dear "One" as in Number one. I write. Then I can't think of anything more to say. Another woman reads and copies a paper I have there, a form. She feels embarrassed and hands it back. A group of women are getting ready to go outside for a little tour walk. I am going to join them. A pudgy short man, a "director" comes in and I pick up a flower design off a cow and sniff it. He does too. It is sweet and delicious. Together we begin to explore as we go on this tour walk and share our delightful flavors and smells with each other. A sweet tender friendship quickly forms. We agree to continue this together after the tour. I accidentally hug him. I am so happy with this connection. Our plump fronts touch and we feel embarrassed and look away. I pull back. Now we leave the tour to go on our own to the next taste treat. Somehow it never happens. His male friends tease him about how silly it is and we sadly separate. I see the women's group going in and I hesitate. Maybe I'll follow them in. I wait hopefully for the good soft warm feelings to return, but it all slowly evaporates. (238 words)

["Physical therapy. Better get going."] I am trying to do exercises of my feet. I use a sort of stair step device. A dog is friendly and nearby. I tell someone he belongs to some people who live with me. A Doctor or physical therapist follows me around, concerned and talking about a possible problem with some of the bones, muscles and joints in my right foot. He names a part or a technique I should be concerned about. (74 words)

["Transformation is happening."] I am in a meeting conference room. A group I belong to like "CDBG." Many members are showing up. A full room. It's the beginning of a new term. People are talkative and pushy, demanding I behave like them. I do not want to. I don't like the way they are following rules without thinking things over themselves. The room is sort of at the end of a series or a long hall of rooms like in a train. The table I'm at goes around and take turns giving their speeches. A few of us are left. We decide to fly our tables up the hall corridor to the front. It's kind of fun. Now we will get some breakfast. So, some man wants me to "comply" with the program. A black man on my right slaps me on the arm. I say don't hit me. He does it again. I say I am going to kick you and then I do. He is very upset with me. I point out I am the honest one. I tell him what I'm going to do and then do it. He just sneaks up and hits. Another man tries to convince me to do the program so I can finally win or earn my sheriff shoes. I laugh saying I don't want sheriff shoes. He is shocked. Why do I do this for me. I say. Because I want to. (238 words)

["Lucid flying."] I am suddenly aware I am in a hypnogogal state and become interested in the images floating by. I feel very envious and excited. I know there are so many I will not remember them all and feel regret I will not. As I continue watching, I see colors and it evolves into a sort of "landscape" of objects. A planter on the left, a red object in it. Sort of buildings along a "sidewall." Then I realize I am lucid as well and get very happy. I look up and see a dark cloudy night sky, Oh, what fun. I can fly. I point my arms up to the sky and begin to fly up, feeling joy. As I go higher, the clouds lessen and I see some stars twinkling through. I headed for the starry deep space and love it. As I fly, I see that now I am over a dark ocean and fairly close to the surface. (As I was up in the air, I asked myself what would I like to see, to know.) (Nothing came to me.) As I skim over the dark ocean on a dark night, I become aware I could choose to dive into the water and explore. I feel resistance. It would be cold and I couldn't breath and potentially scary. Then I challenge myself to do it. I will it to happen, but I just can't do it. It seems too scary. Then everything is so dark I can't see anything. I am completely enclosed in dark. I am slightly worried but I fly with it anyway. (268 words)

["Mermaids and crabs."] I am in a radio station lobby. Waiting. A group of kids (teens are there. I think they are the Hallmark kids. They have lots of energy. They are messy. They've been eating and paper plates and so on are all over. I am trying to pick up the mess. It then falls off my lap. They help me get it off the floor. I am in my power wheelchair. I decide I want to take the garbage to the office area and throw it away. I try to find a door to the office. I struggle past furniture and stuff to one door. It is closed. I turn and retrace my route to the lobby. One of the Hallmark kids walks with me. They think I shouldn't go to the office. That'' the inner sanctum and I shouldn't interrupt. A tall thin man in a manual wheelchair dressed in a fancy white tuxedo wheels past me to the door I turned away from. I think of warning him but don't. I see another door, but it is too narrow for my chair. Then I find the door to the hall. I go in and turn right, down the hall. I enter the office at the end of the hall. I see a group of women in mermaid suits seated in a fake blue "ocean" and taking phone calls. I get the attention of one of them and hand her the small pile of papers and leaves "garbage" I'd collected. She opens an appointment book and says put it in here. I say really? Not sure that makes sense. She says sure, why not? I shrug and put them in. Then I ask her why they are dressed as mermaids when they are dealing with people on the phone who can't see them. She says Oh, we don't have to wear the mermaid suits. We can wear our gym outfits or other costumes. I realize she hadn't really answered my question but don't pursue it. I turn and leave back down the hall. Dovre is with me now. I am carrying in my right hand a sort of orange spongy sea creature with a tiny yellow crab in it. It keeps trying to snip at me with its claws. Dovre is excited about a product for sale. She wants me to buy it. She points to the box (we went into a room on the right) and says see, you can get fireworks. I say to her, I don't want fireworks. She continues to express with enthusiasm how wonderful fireworks are. I say if you want this, you buy it. I then ask her if she wants to hold the crab as it is trying to snip me. She says no thanks. I carry it looking for a place to get rid of it or put it down. I am annoyed with Dovre. (483 words)

["Hypnogogic images."] Lush growing plants like in my front window. As I was aware I was in the hypnogogic state I examined them and saw they were slightly different kinds of leaves. The background is a plate glass window. This image is in the top left corner of a dark purple background. I enjoyed looking at them and thought about how this is a good image that represents growth and health and healing. Another image comes. White with textured swirls. I become aware it's a ceiling. I wonder if my eyes are open and then I know I am seeing a mental image. It goes away. I think how interesting that was a ceiling. Then it pops back up as I thought about it. Another image. A lacy crocheted white rose. Very pretty. (131 words)

["Radio dreams."] I am a child with other children in a school room. I decide to teach them something. I begin talking on my subject. But some radio is playing. A woman's voice is reporting something. I feel annoyed. I look to my right and see an open door to the hall and see some adults standing around sort of watching. I like that they are seeing me teach. I walk toward the door so they can see me better. But the door closes. I feel annoyed. I walk back to the round table where the other kids are. I ask them to turn off that radio. They pay no attention to me at all. I decide to find it and turn it off myself. I feel embarrassed I haven't better control of them. I find a small radio and find the off button but it doesn't work. I find another larger black radio with many many wires. One by one I follow the wire with my hand and yank out the ones plugged in the wall. Nothing helps. The radio keeps on talking. I feel very frustrated. [NOTES: I wake up to NPR news on the radio.] (187 words)

["Crazy man wont go away."] I decide to move into a New York apartment. I find my apartment door and open to discover it is a very tiny room. In fact two different apartment doors open onto the same tiny space. I am very disappointed. I go next door and peek in. It's a nice room. The woman says hi. She walks me down the hall to the next room which is huge and spacious, a sort of community sitting room we can use sometimes. A man in a towel and shower cap steps out. I feel embarrassed. He doesn't seem to mind there are people in his room. We go out into the hall. I step down the large steps and try and find my own apartment doors. It is hard. But I find them and go in. I stand there trying to figure out how to place the furniture. A man, plump and round, and short, with a very round head with short curly almost fuzzy hair knocks on my door and then walks right in. I say hey, this is my apartment. He ignores me. I feel afraid. I think he is a crazy man. I edge out of the apartment and go to the next door apartment. The woman invites me in and I say can I use your phone? There is this weird guy out here. She says sure.. The crazy round man comes right in and he has a son, a smaller version of himself with him. He won't leave. I pick up the phone and say in hushed tones 911. A woman answers and I whisper the address, and they need to come right away because this crazy man wont leave and he might be harmful. I stand there holding the phone waiting for a response. Meanwhile, the son is gone and a baby girl with his same fuzzy hair is there. I pick her up and she is very affectionate. She puckers up and gives me sweet kisses on the cheek. I see the shirt she is wearing has her name on it. Nadia Davis. And a bunch of writing indicating she is from the Catholic charities. I wonder if this is valid information or if the man dressed her like that to fool people. He is standing very close and glaring at me. I feel nervous.. I cuddle the baby trying to ignore the man as I wait for the 911 people to answer. No one comes. (411 words)

["Al Gore dream."] I am still in the New York apartment building of the last dream. The young wife, like Helen Hunt, with red hair, had tried to decorate her tiny apartment. I went in and saw two low couches in garish colors, a golden fur cover on one and multiple colored fake fur on the other. She says this room is too small. She is very disappointed and upset trying to make the furniture work. I sit on one couch, complaining that I will never be able to get out of it because of my knees and she will have to help pull me out. I see the other couch right across from me, the multicolored one is higher and wished I had sat on it. Then I see the baby girl. My god, I said. You had a baby. She smiles distractedly at me. I look more closely and see it is just like the baby the crazy round man of the last dream had with him. I am shocked. You stole a baby? I exclaim. She denies it, trying to change the subject. I say you can't just steal a baby! What will your husband think. Are you going to tell him it's his or that you stole it? She is very upset and won't answer me. She walks out of the room and across the hall. I follow her. We step into a tiny closet sized room and I say to her you have to do something. She paces, wildly thinking it over. She says but it does have red hair, like me. Now we return to her tiny apartment and her husband, Al Gore is there. The round man from the previous dream comes in and is now her brother. He says that's the same baby I stole. You have to give it back. Al looks confused. Helen says you're right. I will. But I really like her. I say she's a good kisser. The baby puckers up and kisses sweet baby kisses at Helen. We agree she is cute. Helen takes the baby to return it to it's people. Al Gore sits down suddenly on the multi colored couch and shakes his head quizzically. He says to himself in unbelieving accents, "He actually fixed a problem: referring to the dead beat brother, as he is usually the problem, not a solution maker. Al is disappointed in himself for not figuring it out himself. A woman from the democratic reception room comes in and says we need you in the reception room right now. Al tiredly gets up and goes. I follow along and pop into a long room with tables set up with snacks etc. on them. I hurriedly check the signs to make sure I am in the democratic room, not the republican one. I am in the democratic room. I see many people all dressed up in weird pink cellophane wrap costumes lining up to go out and rally for Gore. They are all tall and look like giant bottles shapes would look like if wrapped in cellophane with a ribbon tied at the top. They pass me in single file. An organizer woman says to me can you walk? I say not for long, but I could wheelchair it, except for all the stairs. No good, she says. There are stairs at the door. I wander over to the snack table which is nearly empty saying under my breath. There are stairs everywhere. I look over to Al Gore hoping he heard me, as that is something he should be fixing. He is of course paying attention to the campaign people and didn't hear. The woman asks if I want a snack and I see the large red and white sausages and say, no, there's nothing here that I can eat, what with my Atkins diet. I leave and return to the tiny apartment. Now the woman that used to live next door has moved in with Helen, Al Gore and myself. We have a second small room adjoining the tiny one. She and Al are in the tiny room talking. The woman says she sure wishes she could have her own place there is no privacy here. I step into the next room to look at what's in it. A piano, some odds and ends of furniture. No bed. I wonder where we will all sleep. I look into an open doorway and see a shower room. I say so that's what a roll in shower room would look like. It is white and bare and ugly. No toilet, just a big shower. Then a stream of water pours down on me at the doorway. Hurriedly I back away saying and its wet. Now the water is spraying out all over the room with the piano. I call out for help. Al comes in and looks but doesn't do anything. A maintenance man rushes in and tries to fix it but now the water rushes out in a major stream, knocking him over. I notice his bare butt as he washes past me. (850 words)

["Party time."] I am at a huge party. Lots of couples. Romances are starting up, dancing, broken hearts as couples find their partners getting together with new people. It is a house of many rooms. At one end there is a pivoted angle. Later I am the woman giving the party. I go from room to room hosting. One room is a bedroom where exhausted revelers are resting. One is a fuzzy yellow eyed "alien." I wake him and say its 4:00. You might want to rejoin the party. He's too tired and sleepy. I move on out to a kitchen with 4 stoves in it. I become aware that's a dream image. (111 words)

["Shards of multi-colored glass in my mouth."] I own a business of some sort. Alan Alda and I are there. He is a medical Doctor. We are friendly. He wants me to go with him to see the area where the employees are doing arts and crafts projects in their free time. Maybe we'll play and have fun there. We walk over to a table area and I notice a small shard of colored glass is on my finger. I had touched the table surface with my hand and a piece stuck to me. Someone had been doing a cut glass project. I carefully take it out of my finger and see more shards on the table. I want to move on someplace more safe but Alan is interested in showing me something there. I notice another shard. I pull it out, then another and then I am in bare or stocking feet and get some on my toes. I am worried. Alan stands there observing. I want him to help me but he doesn't. More and more I find the shards. Red, green, blue ones. Then one is in my mouth. That distresses me as I might swallow it and cut my throat inside. I carefully remove it, Then more and more until my mouth is full of them. I must be very careful swallowing. I am worried and Alan simply watches. I'm pulling out bunches of them now. I say to him, I need a restroom. He vacantly looks around. I see a sink and try to rinse these shards out of my mouth. It's becoming scary. (262 words)

I am at school, entering a class room. A young man is setting up a tall rectangular clear plastic box. Several musicians are setting up to play music. The man asks me sympathetic questions about when did I play music myself and too bad I can't do that anymore. I tell him about my Rheumatoid Arthritis and how my fingers were deformed and I had to give up playing instruments. I tell the story nostalgically and he is empathetic. Later, he and I are going to sing a song together. We'd worked on a bit. A sort of impromptu moment. We begin to sing and falter as we both forget the words. We look at each other for guidance on the next word. Finally we stop and sit down. I say to the small group of people listening "He forgot the words." Nobody seems upset or cares. I even feel relaxed about it. (153 words)

["The blue fish story."] I am seated mid-air, listening to some lecture or some offer being made that could be good for me (or whoever gets it). A small fuzzy slipper shaped yellow and black stripped creature (there are 2 of them) zip around in the air. One of them comes to me and holds tightly to the bottom of my left foot. As it presses snugly up against my heel, I feel it humming and vibrating vigorously. It is intense, almost uncomfortable, but I also feel a bit honored it is doing this. I seem to understand it is trying to help me to get the offered thing the lecturer is talking about. Then the creature flies me fast up to the ceiling and back down to where I was seated in the air. It repeats this a number of times. I am concerned I will bump my head on the ceiling but it never happens. Now he pulls me down to the floor near the offer being made. I repeat this several times. Then he flies me around the room. I am concerned I am distracting the lecturer or disturbing the few other people there also seated in mid-air. Then the creature brings me to the place where the lecturer is. Only, now there is a large poster with some instructions and graphics. I am thought instructed to push the area marked G2. I push it, a little confused which area is the right one to push. It lights up with blue light. Apparently I've entered to try and get the offer. Now two young business men are speaking. They are explaining the offer they will give people. Land, a house and help them get started to build their lives as they wish. The second young man cautions them everyone not to get too complacent and expect everything to be supplied to them. They must help themselves and be active workers on their project. Now it seems I have won the offer. I am given a small package to open, but first I notice the two fuzzy creatures are wrapped uncomfortably in red clothes. I help them by removing the red coverall wrappers so they are free. Then I unwrap the package. A blue fish (the size of a goldfish is there, no water. I realize I need to get it in water. I carry it quickly to a kitchen sink and grab a red/gold bowl and pour water from the faucet. I then notice it is warm water which might harm the fish. So I adjust the water to cold. The blue fish slips into the sink where the water is warm. I scoop him out and into the small fish bowl of cold water. He turns into a gold fish and swims around. Then the bowl is a large aquarium tank. The fish swims around. I see two parts of a dead fish like a trout in there. At first I want to remove it but then realize it will be food for them. I see a few small mosquitos and put them in the tank for food. There I see a cricket and scoop him in there for the fish. The fish is apparently a good special thing that will bring me good things and happiness. (547 words)

["Crocodile."] I am visiting a house where my mother lives. It is on a river. A patio door opens right onto the river. I stand at the open door and look down into the river. The current is swift as it passes under the house. I look at the bottom of the river and ask how deep it might be. I speculate the river might be 4 feet deep. I feel a twinge of worry that I could fall in and be swept away by the current. I stick my right foot into the water. A large black crocodile appears very close to my foot. I realize my foot is in danger. I know I need to quickly pull my foot out of the water and step back but I don't. I struggle with myself mentally and finally slowly pull my foot back into the house. I step back and the crocodile comes up into the house. Now it is a crocodile boy and walks two legged. It is dangerous to have him in the house. I don't know what to do to get him out. I follow him around to try and keep him from doing any damage. Now a man and a woman come in. They intend to do damage to the top of the chimney so we will be driven out by smoke and then they will steal things. I see clouds of white smoke starting to build up and descend down toward us. I see her reaching from the chimney top to grab at objects on a shelf to steal. She is a clown/comedic performer. I am angry at her. I tell her to stop. She laughs and ignores me. Now she is in the house and doing a comedy performance to a small group of people. I stand on the side angrily watching. I want her to leave. Somehow I take over the performance area and try to do her routine from her notes. I fumble along adlibbing as best I can. I do OK, but it's a bit lame. She watches sort of pulling me down, but a small bit of respect is there. I come off the "stage" and say to a friend, she didn't even have a script. Only some pictures. That was hard to do. I am mellowing my attitude about her as well. Now I'm in another room. My mother comes in and says look at my new hair cut. I tell her I like it. It makes her look years younger. At first it looks like a page boy bouffant style. Her hair is brown. As I look more closely, I see her hair is buzz cut on the left side as she faces me and there are hair stubble on her cheek. The top is combed over to the right and then curls down around her ear. The stubble is unattractive and I am very surprised at the modern buzz cut style. This is not usual for my mother. (500 words)

["Aliens kill nightmare."] I/a woman is entering an airplane. The dream ego is watching from behind her. I see her feet stepping into the raised carpeted stairs in the aisle as she steps down each step like in a raked seating situation. She walks to the front. She turns to the right and pulls out a black pistol and fires into the chest of a passenger, male. A man stands up and also pulls out a gun and begins to kill passengers. Between the two they kill every passenger. Then they throw the bodies out the windows on one side. They are aliens. Another I (the dream ego) is in another airplane, in the cockpit. The Captain tensely says to his crew to lock the door. I see people falling out of the other airplane. The crew member nearest the door is afraid and fumbles as he tries to lock the door. The lock turns and holds. They know it's aliens and they are next. I wake up afraid. (166 words)

["Dream program presentation."] I am at an ASD conference. It's the middle of the night. I'd been working hard on my dream program and the research on my dreams. A man, friendly and attracted to me, is very interested in the findings of my work. I tell Charla my granddaughter she needs to go to bed now. I shut down the computer even though the man is still very interested in my dream program work. I need to leave to give my presentation. I am now at the conference. I walk up a few steps to the stage area and to the podium. I look down at the audience noticing the high backed pews they are sitting in. They seem to be a it far away. I begin my talk. I am aware of a pile of papers on the podium. A bit messy. I wonder where I should start. I begin to describe how we can search a root word and get all the syntaxed versions of the word.. I proudly announce I have a 15,000 word dictionary, melted down from my... I mean Barbara Sanders... many dreams over 25 years. I see audience members smiling at my slip of the tongue I make the same slip often. I'm not fooling anyone. I begin to talk about the category system, how it started with the Hall/van De Castle system. About this time, I realize I'm getting enthusiastic about describing how my dream program works and how I created this and this. I shift the topic to the research results, which is the main topic of the presentation. I announce I am very excited about the results of my research. I studied my...Barb Sanders nightmares. I found a very high pattern of the feeling "resistance."` and not fear or disgust as I had expected. Then I found a high level of a "sense of peace" This really interests the audience. I say, let me show you the results on the transparency. I look to my right and realize the assistant did not have the overhead projector set up. I rush over and try to find the transparencies and do it myself. I see piles of them and leaf through them but don't find mine. I am aware I could lose the audience with this distraction and go back to the podium and continue with my presentation without the transparencies saying perhaps the assistant is merely late and will yet show up. He never shows up and I continue the presentation. (417 words)

["Get out of my way."] I am a young well built woman wearing a red business style suit. I walk into a room to be at a workshop. I am a bit late and the room is so crowded that many women are standing. I squeeze in I am way in the back behind all the other women. I can't see very well. I keep trying to get a better look at the presenter. I'd heard he is a very handsome man and an excellent presenter. When ever I see a glimpse of him, I am not happy with his appearance. He seems short and not particularly handsome. I try and change how he looks. I think "Michael J. Fox" but he doesn't really improve. As he speaks, slowly the crowd shifts or decreases enough so that he can see me. I am aware of how good I look and he does notice. He is attracted to me. After the workshop, he comes over to talk with me. We are interrupted in our attempt to get to know each other by a disabled man with CP. He wants some assistance getting things organized so he can manage better independently. The handsome man isn't too helpful but he does try. The disabled man is impatient with the handsome man. After a desk has been moved and organized better, the handsome man lies on the floor I follow over to where he is, but the disabled man insists that I watch him. The disabled man felt that the handsome man had slowed him down or blocked him from showing me how fast he can move on a push cart. The disabled man gets on the push cart and goes to the opposite end of the room from me. He says look. I feel a bit annoyed or thwarted because this is getting in the way of me approaching the handsome man. It takes time to stop and watch him and the path of the push cart is between me and the handsome man. The disabled man doesn't wait for me to respond. He rushes as fast as he can across the room having to avoid hitting the prone handsome man. I say impatiently to the disabled man (over my shoulder as I continue to walk toward the handsome man) Great. You did that in 3 seconds (which really is impressive and fast.) (395 words)

["Helping the horse."] I am at a sort of apartment building, staying for a week or so. I am in a kitchen area. I am trying to pack my things to go home. I see a curio cabinet and remember I need to put things back in there the way it was before I arrived and moved them. As I'm looking around to get my things, an old "cowboy" comes in singing a country western song. I don't think he sings all that well. I leave the kitchen and start going up some flights of stairs. Some of the stairs go down but somehow the direction in general is up. The next flight seems broken. I try and arrange the boxes that make up the flight which is laying on a flat floor. Then I see an iron and an ironing board. I remember I need to iron my pink dress. A woman comes over and says Hi. She says too bad you're leaving. We could have been good friends. She's an artist. I agree. She leaves. I iron the flounce on the hem of the dress. The steam iron works well and gets the wrinkles out. Now I leave. I get on a beautiful powerful dark horse. He has lots of energy. I guide him to the edge of the cement highway. I hold him back from running as it's not a good safe surface for him to run. A car pulls in front of us and I look back to see if the traffic is clear so we can go around the car on the highway. I see a car but decide we have enough time and guide the horse out there. The horse refuses and pulls back. We fall. I get up and pull on the reins to get him up. I feel badly because he was right. It was dangerous to go out there. I start to get on him. I pat his neck affectionately. He looks at me and then looks at his feet. I know he's trying to tell me something. I look at his feet and say do you need the ankle taped? He nods. I say which one. He points his nose at the left rear one. I see a black plastic piece on the road and pick it up. He nods yes. I say OK. I'll go get some tape. I walk up a graveled driveway and see an old shed garage and go in. I see a man putting up his rock band equipment. On his right a sort of biker is fixing things. I see a roll of scotch tape. I go to him and ask if I can borrow some tape. He's grumpy and complains about people who take from others. I say to him, forget it, I don't need this crap, as he started to reach out to shake my hand. He quickly pulls his hand back. I realize I'd blown it. Seems he changed his mind and was going to give me the tape. I say never mind, I'll find tape from someone else and walk out. I see an open door on my left. A woman lies on the floor on her belly painting the bottom edge of the door. I ask her if I could borrow some tape. She thinks about it and says yeah, she had some special tape. She rolls or crawls on her belly over inside and gets a sheet of textured tape and carefully cuts a short piece. I needed one longer but decide to make do with it. She gives it to me and gets distracted by a small hole in her wall at the baseboard. She exclaims over and over at something she sees in there. I get the impression its mice or bugs. Oh dear, oh dear! She says. Then she tells me she's an artist and a vegan. I lean in to see what she sees. "A squirrel" I say. I thank her for the tape and return to the horse and carefully wrap his ankle with the black plastic and the tape. The biker guy had followed me and he sees I really did need the tape for a good reason. He feels badly he didn't help. (709 words)

I have a brother. He and his friend, a Tim Allen type, comes by. They are carrying some items of importance to them. Ceramic figures in a box. We three go down a road carrying this box carefully. It is important to them nothing gets broken. This has to do with a sport they love and maybe play. Tim is playful and silly. We walk a long way. Then the pieces become rattled and more damage to some of them. My brother and Tim are upset. I sigh. I have no respect for Tim's sports antics and jokes. My brother wants me to like his friend. It is night and we find a tiny light to see how bad the damage is to the ceramic figures. We go up to a house and use their porch to pull the figurines out. I work carefully to try and fix them. Tim keeps up a steady patter of silly talk and finally says something that offends me. I refuse to speak to him. He keeps trying to get me to talk to him, conjoling me and teasing. Now we are carefully packing all the figures back in the box. I am relieved we didn't wake up the owners of the house. My brother calls in a few more of his sports buddies to help us carry all these things. I find one more figurine on the porch. I wrap it carefully in the box. The new friend now does a rhythm thing and a chant. My brother says it is important, like a blessing on the box of figurines. He wants me to not be such a grump and join in. I grudgingly try to chant and listen. Tim wants me to be a good sport. (294 words)

["Stealing my things."] I live in a house. People start coming in the back door without permission. 1st it's one, then another and more and more. They are taking things and leaving, then returning for more. I am angry at them and a little scared, but I do try and stop them. I call out to them to stop. They ignore me. I stand in front of one plump big guy and try to block his way. He threatens me. I feel afraid of him, but I don't back down. I just hope he doesn't hurt me too badly. He walks around me and continues to take things. I decide to call 911 for the police, realizing as I thought it that of course it won't work it never does. But I try anyway. I never even find the phone. Finally I give up. They're too many of them and what the hell, maybe I'll be better off without all this stuff anyway. (160 words)

I am in a room where a woman is standing facing us and we are seated, like school. She is giving us instructions on how to properly take this test. This has something to do with the elections because I can hear a voice droning on about the elections. I am not really paying attention. I don't think I planned on actually doing the test. At the last minute I decide to do it, so I look carefully at the paper on my desk and look up to see the example. There are two parts. One of the parts is called "Checker." I must compare patterns and choose from #1 or #2. #1 is red and #2 is orange. I have to describe how they are in relationship to each other. I use the < and > signs to say orange has less intensity than red. I then see a drop of lotion. I try to wipe it away. It is bigger now and I keep wiping at it and it keeps getting bigger and bigger. A big messy drippy puddle of lotion now all over my cat Bootsie. The cat looks emaciated very lean and skinny, naked of fur with enormous yellow eyes, the black pupils dilated and huge. I hold her over the waste basket to let the lotion mess drip off her. Finally I get it all in the waste basket. (231 words)

["The blind helping me find the bathroom."] I am walking down a graveled lane trying to get to my "room." Maybe I'm at a resort. I need to go to the bathroom. Mirabelle is walking with me. I tell her if we take the lane to the right that goes steeply uphill, we will find the accessible bathroom. She wants us to go to our accommodations first to put away the groceries. I need to pee, but agree. We get to our room. I go in. Mirabelle is outside still saying how happy she is to help me out. That's what friends are for. She asks me to hand her the salad on the counter. I look in the sink and see packages of bacon and hamburger. So I think this is supposed to be in the refridge. I look and see "keep refrigerated" on the bacon package. I carry them over and put them in the fridge. I see a few cut carrots and some lettuce on a plate and carry it to the patio door and look down (one story). A blind man (Steve) steps toward the window. I direct him verbally. Its 2 more feet, now there's a curb. He's going to also help me find the restroom. (204 words)

I am in a spacious kitchen. The appliances are fancy like you'd find in a wealthy person's mansion. I am looking at the garbage disposal, the label that tells you about the updates you will receive. I see bananas fresh and yellow in bins stacked very tidily. I am touched the kitchen staff has been keeping bananas there for me even though I can't eat them now on the Atkins diet. I see one that is blackening and decide to use the garbage disposal. I pull off the peel. The banana breaks in half. It is dry and old. I can't figure out how to use this fancy disposal. I now lie on the floor to figure it out. As I am there, a door opens and a series of disabled people with limps and braces and cp walk in. Everyone is dressed up for a party. They are in a party now, laughing and hugging each other. They are going to a room across the hall from the kitchen. I think about joining them. It would be nice to find a mate. Here's an opportunity. I see one young woman repeatedly intensely hugging a young man in a bright yellow suit jacket. I realize these are also mentally retarded people. She comes over by me. Now I am in my wheelchair. She grabs the handles of the chair and tips me back. I say, startled, Do not touch my chair again. Then I go off to the party room. I don't. (252 words)

A Mexican General Reillo is a dictator. He is cruel and harms the people. I am camping out in the country there. I show a photo of how brown and arid the semi desert area of Central Mexico is. But I notice there are trees and a river where I'm camped. I even swim in the river, enjoying the cool wet swim. Now I'm in a hospital bed. I'm exhausted. I want to get up but seem unable to. I am so tired. Paulina comes in and I say, "I can't seem to get up." she says. Why should you. You're still recovering. I feel better about it after she says that. Then they (my daughter) get me in a van (like VW). We are sitting parked next to a river. The windows are open and mosquitoes are coming in, lots of them. I ask them to close the windows. I smash some of the mosquitoes but there are lots of them. No one moves to shut the windows In annoyance I reach over and struggle to shut the windows. (180 words)

["Manna from heaven."] I am hungry. I see Bill Clinton's face in the sky. He is doing a spell to pull fish from something. I see a long line of fish coming out and falling to earth. They come near where I am. I wait eagerly for a fish to fall near me so I can eat it. As I watch, the fish turn into seals. One lands on a tall white church on a ledge, then 4 or 5. They will get away. If I don't hurry and catch them. (88 words)

["Nude notes."] I am talking to a well developed teen. She and her friends are talking. She says in her nude modeling class they take nude notes at the teacher's request. I think she wants to shock me. She also says If I'd known boys obsess on big breasts, I'd have bought a different bikini. I then enter the conversation and say yes, boys really like big breasts. And I feel empathy for them in the nude notes situation because they are more vulnerable than the girls. What do you mean one teen asks. I say because they never know when they will have an erection. 2 teen boys are there. I wonder if it is appropriate for me to be talking about sexual stuff like this with these young teens.

I hesitate and then say, "Yes, you need to guard her. She escapes every chance she gets. In my mind's eye, I see her already escaping from the fields. (106 words)

["Tired and sleepy."] I am on a grassy gentle rolling hill meadow. There is a group of young women, one is Anita B. from high school. They are a group I join in with late. They all ready have their official pen given to group members. Mine looks different than theirs. There are at least 2 "monk" like teachers, male. I lie down on the grass. I feel so tired and sleepy. I can't seem to keep my eyes open. The monks encourage me to get up and join in activities with the women. I groggily get up. Anita B. hugs me and does this rocking hug that is like dancing. She moves us up the grassy slope to where the women already had their school desks, hidden under the surface of the grass. They dig down to reveal the "pigeon hole" desks. I see their pens are wrapped in pink tissue paper, mine is in white. I ask why wrapped in pink. Anita says because that indicates things that glow. (168 words)

I eat a few M and M's, noticing how quickly they melt in my mouth. I wonder if the sugar will affect my heartbeat but I'm not too worried about it. A small group of people come in and I want to share with them the video tapes of this years performances at the celebration. (Like E City Celebration) They become bored and I say well, then shall we look at the 1st one, 3 years ago? (I remember I'd done some performing in my sexy pink dress and want to show that.) They agree. I ask a man in the group to run the remote control. I say each segment is repeated so be sure and fast forward those parts. (153 words)

Charla and I are in a play together. It's the life story of an important inventor. I roll on stage. 2 males are there. Charla comes in after me. I'd forgotten my lines and try to go back stage and get a script. I find one and rush back. I begin the narrative story of his life. I can't read the script so I struggle to remember the chronological order of events. I point to a picture of a sail boat and I say that's one of my favorite toys. But I did not like the power boat. Then I leave the stage to fly a short circle. Charla follows me. I get in a round thing and it goes up and around and down. I nearly crash it. I rush back to the stage. I comment there were many ways I could have crashed! Charla is rushing to catch up. I go on stage, wishing I'd waited for a moment for Charla to get into proper position. It would have been better for her if I'd waited. I felt selfish and unthoughtful. (183 words)

The students are seated in a crowded "jury box" style of seating. As I walk around the outside edge lecturing. I realize I need to be closer to them, to connect, to be a better teacher. I lean in and put my arm around the shoulders of students and talk directly toward them. They like that better. Now I am on stage teaching a larger group I am teaching them how to be good farmers. I look at the back of the audience and see my mentor Katherine Hepburn. I am pleased and honored she is there. I walk back to her and greet her. Then I return to the stage. I call on a student to come up there. I ask him questions. I say, can you tell me when it's a good time to harvest the green beans? He takes this as a cue as to what he's supposed to do and starts picking green beans growing on a fence on stage. He says stupidly, well, when they look big and there's a lot of them, then you pick them. (215 words)

I am in a large ship. I see a TV and wonder who's it is. I figure out it is Ellie's. Lots of my things are on this ship. Charla is there, as a baby. Ginny is there. Suddenly there is a loud explosion. The ship is blown into a billion pieces. I am now swimming in the water. I am desperately looking for something floating piece I can cling to. At first, I don't see any. Then I find a small white square of something. Now I am frantically searching for Charla and Ginny. I feel sad they are probably dead. I notice lots of my things on the bottom of the water. Before it was dark and deep but now it is shallow. I could probably stand up. I am near the shore. (like a lake.) I see wooden buildings of a camp near by. I get back to my home. I am very relieved to find Charla and Ginny there. Charla is about 9 months to a year old, all in white a sweet baby bonnet on her head. She is plump and chubby cheeked. I go to her and pick her up. Hugging her, I mention she has a Doctor's appointment. Ginny and maybe Ellie as a child start to walk down the street. They will meet us at Dr. Smythe's office. Bonnie and I follow. I'm carrying Charla. Bonnie becomes distressed. She thought we'd be riding in the van. She stops and complains its too far to walk. I say here's the key. You go back and get the van and meet me there. She agrees. Now I am carrying a small kitten, playful and sweet. I walk. The sidewalk becomes blocks of wood and I come to a wall. I hop down off the sidewalk onto the dirt street and walk. Now I am at the camp that I saw from the water. Three paths branch out from the one I'm on. One curves around the left back to the camp. One curves to the right. One goes straight. I walk it up the hill. It is steep. Then at the top, I get confused. I see to my right and down a small town. Maybe that is Dr. Smythe's office there. I see some people and ask them. They think I have to continue on, her office is at "Vine Maple Leaf" town. I don't know which way to go. I am standing on the edge of the hill and have to step back as my feet are sliding on the dirt like I'm going to fall off. I decide to go down to the small town and check there. The kitten is trying to leap out of my arms. (457 words)

["Engulfing waves."] I and 2 other people are standing watching huge "60 foot" waves crashing up over the top of a huge mountain peak. It is awesome in size and power. I am afraid I won't survive it. We decide our survival depends on enduring under the wave. We stand with some kind of air bubble plastic over us. We are surrounded by the pounding waters, engulfed. We hold our breath, waiting for the wave to pass and recede. We barely make it. The other woman keeps talking nervously as a wave hits. I am concerned she will use all the air. After a very large one, I say wow. I'll bet that was a 30 foot wave. A woman like our neighbor says with scorn, I measured it. It was only 28 foot. You didn't have your facts. I glare at her angrily. I felt put down. I mumbled I got pretty close on my guess. I turn and go inside a cave. Like deserting them. Then I turn and join them again for the next huge wave. After I survived that one, I decide to go out away from the mountain it might be safer. As I stand on the flat plains, a wave of high water surges at us only waist high. But as I watch, the wave over the mountain had picked up huge round boulders (black). They are rushing toward us. I turn and run for my life. Someone yells get behind something. I find a rocky outcrop and crouch behind it. The boulders that would have killed me crush and break up on my shield. I decide its safer right under the mountain. I return to there. (281 words)

["Making the house accessible."] I am moving into a very large house. I am very tired and sleeping on a couch in a living room. I am waiting for a couple of people who are going to help me move in and make he house accessible. I hear the people who just arrived. One is a man like Gary in a manual chair. I get up and walk around. I see the other man brought some children and cats and dogs. 4 or 5 cats are walking along the shallow edge of the swimming pool. Bootsie throws herself in. I call out a warning. Be careful. You'll get wet! She swims frantically to get out. Then a large furry golden colored dog dives in and swims across. The dog gets out and begins to shake herself all over. I groan. Oh, no. What a mess. Gary comes over. I hurriedly try to remember where I left my power chair. I feel it might embarrass Gary if I'm walking. I find it and follow him out to a porch and a flight of stairs. He's out of his chair sitting on the top step. I sit next to him. A tree is growing right out of the stairs. I sit right in front of the tree. A girl is pushing at the tree for fun. But the tree seems unstable and could fall over. I ask her to stop. Gary is telling me he can fix the annoying problem of the drapes which are so full. They get caught up in my wheels. I am very glad he can fix this accessibility problem. (268 words)

I live in an apartment with a nice man, like Alan A. There are a few other young Chicano roommates that I don't like. They leave for awhile. A woman, like Lucille Ball comes in. I told they'd gone for awhile. She rushes in to steal anything of value from them. I go in to help her because I don't like them. As I help her carry stuff out, Alan wakes up and I feel guilty and embarrassed. I tell Lucille I don't like this and I start putting their things back in their room and telling Lucille it is wrong to steal. She is furious with me and threatens to get her gangster friends to come beat me up. Now that Alan is awake, I feel strong and righteous. I tell her to pack up and leave and help her pick up her many colored pens. Boxes of them. I also see lots of LP album records that belong to the Chicano roommates. I sort of pile them up.

["Greek school."] I am in a group of people in an open courtyard thing. We are learning different things. At one point I observe a policeman presenting a delicious all white cake with lots of sweet frosting to a young woman having a B'day. But I see the cop take the biggest and best piece out of the center and eat it. This is unfair, but the woman does not protest. I eat a small remaining piece. It is very sweet and soft and delicious. Now I see a large gargoyle statue climbing up an outside wall of this Greek like building. Some large being at the top kicks at some rubble and it all tumbles down on the gargoyle. Now a group of people are discussing issues. I watch one man in particular in the group. He watches me with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. We are attracted to each other. I listen carefully. Then someone from the group asks me a question. I am surprised because I'm not a member of the group. But I answer. The man wears a Greek fisherman's hat and moves closer. We are sexually attracted. Apparently at the end of this festive occasion there is a conga line dance and everything is sexual. He has a dildo massage unit and suggests we take turns with different ends on it to best pleasure each other. I'm looking forward to it. (235 words)

I am teaching a class in an old high school. The room is very large with high ceilings. There are many students. I am teaching English or Language Arts. As I am lecturing, students talk among themselves. I get up and walk around. I am annoyed and raise my voice. I continue lecturing. They escalate their voices and move around in groups, deliberately trying to be disrespectful and belligerent. I raise my voice. I tell them they must sit down now. They ignore me. Now we are full blown involved in a power struggle. I am very angry. I threaten them. I demand. I continue to talk. They are more disrespectful. Finally I stop talking and write on the board they will all be suspended. Go to the principal. They are already (some of them) out in the hall. I tell them they must write a 2000 word essay on civil disobedience due on January 2nd. They will flunk if it isn't handed in. They are now converging on me. I am out of control. Holding in my anger just barely. I wake up, still feeling angry. I can't let go of the feelings. (194 words)

I am in an open field or a university campus. Lots of students are there. A woman teacher is talking to the group. I am suddenly concerned I had forgotten to study for a mathematics class and maybe a science class. I feel a bit of panic. Then I relax and think oh, well, it's my last term. I'm not going to worry about it. If I flunk those classes, then I flunk. I see a plate full of hamburger gravel and corn. It is my left over mess. I start to put some water in it to scrub off the mess. Right in the middle of the field as the teacher talks to the students. Then a man talks. He is sharing how he came back to school after some time being out of school. He confesses he's in trouble. He didn't study, he partied and now he's on drugs and flunking. He tells his story. I and others feel great empathy for him as he slowly walks sadly away. I am now sweeping up a gravelly mess off the field like I'd been doing on the plate. A student runs after the man. I am relieved someone will try and help him. The woman teacher stands there staring at him. A Tom Hanks kind of counselor goes to him. Good. He will get some help. (227 words)

I am watching a young man like Matthew Broderick trying to figure out how to push himself around in a manual wheelchair. It is a very wide one for a fat person. It's so wide he's like a little boy in it, all squished down and stretching out his arms but he can't get the wheels to turn. So he tries sticking his leg out one side and his other leg out the other side so he can use his foot to push. That doesn't work either. As he struggles, I want to tell him the chair is too wide for him. I feel shy because I like him so I don't speak. Now I use my manual chair. I get around fine. He watches. I am rolling through a series of railroad cars with lots of strips of wood lying on the floor. It gets difficult so I say to him your chair is too wide. He gets defensive. I go out of the car into a tourist trap shop. I see examples of graphics that are "master shots" for film. I notice how all the elements are blocked so everything shows well. A narrator says kids these days don't know how to draw these and so can't compete to do films. I go into another room. A sort of display museum about this painted lady of the old days. She is a prostitute. I see a picture of 2 of them riding horses in their petticoats through a gang of men. It's a play. Now we are encouraged to pay some money to see the end of the play. A young man is on trial. I say to my male friend I don't know if I want to go see it or not. They've got my curiosity up, but I'm afraid they won't really tell us the end of the story honestly. I decide to go in, I am disappointed as I see the prostitutes preparing to throw 40 very hungry crabs into a swim pool throwing food to one which pounces on the live food and rips it apart in a feeding frenzy. She says she and the other women are going to dive in with these vicious crabs. I want to leave. What a rip off. (380 words)

I am given a yellow pill to swallow and it gets stuck in my throat. I can't get it to go up or down. I ask he woman doctor for a glass of water. She sits quietly, refusing to give me the water. She thinks I'm being hysterical and not trying hard enough. I am angry at her and ask again. Again, she says no. While a part of me agrees I don't try hard enough sometimes, I am aware I've done all I can here. I demand an official complaint sheet. She hands me a book of them. They are different colored squares. Each one has a specific name on it. The first one is Anastasia. I can't find the one for the Doctor. (125 words)

I am standing on a square metal box, a large one. Six foot tall maybe. My volunteer job is to help a retarded young man in some activities. I am having trouble getting down off the box. Someone is telling me to hurry. I tell them I can't hurry. I need to be safe. The young man can wait. He does wait. I finally get down and go to him. He is very happy to see me. I devise a game. I put different sized balls down on the floor in a long hall. He laughs with joy. Now time is up. So I say Let's go pick up the balls now. I find 2 flat boxes to put them in. He comes with me and occasionally picks up a ball but I do most of the work. Lots of puzzle pieces too. I remind myself not to use so many small pieces next time. I am aware of how long this is taking. But it is important to complete the task. (172 words)

["Fixing the klieg light."] I am a crew member of a production. I see a huge bright colored klieg light has fallen down from the top center stage. It is oddly shaped like a set of airplane wings like you'd wear on a pin. Bright red and yellow colors. I ask the boss if he needs this light. He says yes. I turn it on and it is blindingly bright. Very powerful. I turn it off and call for a very very tall ladder. I climb carefully up. I am a bit scared of the height and cling tightly to anything I can to keep secure. I see a tiny nail where the light had been. No wonder it fell. I now tack it up with large brackets. It is there very solid. I turn it on and the light is again blinding. I ask the director in the control booth if he can control it. He grins and says yes. Then he asks me to come up there. I climb down the ladder and walk up the stairs to the lighting control booth. I go in. It is clear the director is interested in teaching me how to direct and use the lighting booth. I am pleased. (204 words)

["Domhoff conference."] I have traveled to California to spend a few days with Bill Domhoff and the graduate students again as they work on my dreams. We are standing on a sidewall outside the University buildings. Bill says on Tuesday we will camp out in a tent here. I find this unusual and strange but just say oh, OK. I wonder if the storm water grate at the corner will work for a toilet. Bill goes off to do something. Melissa, a grad student, stays with me to visit. I ask if we have any scheduled events that first evening. She doesn't know. Now a man gives me a ride. We talk as we travel through the huge cities streets. I get out and he goes on. I see what I thought was a bus stop. I cross the street to discover it's a street light. I now realize I'm stranded in the outskirts of a large city with no bus to get back. I'm in my power chair. I go to a gas station to ask if there's any buses down the road. The man is very busy. I get out of my power chair and get into a car in the backseat. Other people are in the car. It's being repaired. First the car is tilted up to the left and I roll over toward this man in the backseat. Then we are tilted to the right. It's like a carnival ride. Now I'm the only person in the car and it tips up on it more and twirls very fast. Now the ride is over and I get out. I hope my chair is parked safely out of the way of the car. Melissa is one of the people there. I tell her my predicament. She is concerned for me. I suggest that after her car is repaired we could put my chair in her trunk and I'd ride with her. She hesitates and then agrees but I know she's worried. She mentions a concern about her paint job being scratched up. I say to her directly I know you don't want to do this so I'll find another way. She is relieved but I am stuck. I say I'll have to hire a handicab and that will cost lots of money. Over $100. She is sorry for me but not helpful. I ask the man owner if I can use his telephone. He agrees. Then I burst into nervous tears. Melissa asks what's wrong? I say Oh, I'm just upset and hungry. I'll miss my dinner, The man says there's a restaurant near by. Melissa tells me it will be an hour before the handicab shows up. So we start walking to find the restaurant, me in my chair. I see through large glass windows a group of five male employees at another repair bay that are fighting. One of them sees me and thinks I am a customer. He is very anxious to explain why they are fighting and he tries very hard to stop the fighting. I wave my hands to indicate I'm not a customer. I am now sitting with Melissa on the street edge waiting for the handicab. I complain bitterly about how much it will cost and how in E City we have accessible buses everywhere. I wished I'd not ridden with that man. (561 words)

I rescue two weird bags that are connected somehow to important TV comedian energy. I ask them if they are willing to come with me. I don't want regular people to know I have them with me. I ask them to be quiet and not attract attention. After I plead with them about how important this is, they agree. I sneak them down raked bleacher seating. We get on an open elevator platform. Some boxes of their things are with us. I push the elevator button. I keep the glass door open so no one can stop the elevator and blow our cover. A white polar bear says It's a good thing you did that. I'm not fond of comedians. We go to a floor, overshoot it and stop. We are looking for Apt. #15. They panic because we don't find it right there. I insist we go down the hall and look. I find an open door and look in. A woman with her children says what? I say is this #15? She says no, but I'm thinking of moving soon. You can have this one. I say may we come in and look? She says OK. One room with a narrow hospital bed in the middle but the back room is huge. Real narrow doors. Too narrow for a wheelchair. A square area for the bathroom with all this space around it. (234 words)

I apologize to my client and suggest she wait and call back. I realize this isn't good for the client who is having a crisis now. I feel guilty for not helping her right then. I am angry at Sharon as I realize she isn't showing up. In fact, I'm thinking I'm supposed to take the kids to her. The energy of the boy is somehow transferred to the teen. She sits on my lap and tries to manipulate my mind. She wants me to think of sex. I firmly fight it off. I have work to do. (186 words)

["Gaston dies."] I am watching TV. I see a news story about Gaston. It's an interview. I see the lovely modern non cluttered look of the inside of his house. He is doing some silly trick of standing up on some logs near a fireplace and balancing. I am shocked to hear that he had just died. I feel sad. I also wonder if he left a will. Who will get his stuff? I'd like to get some of it, but I can't imagine he would have left any of it to me. I feel guilty for thinking so materially and selfishly. Now I am remembering a meeting he and I had before he died. We are meeting at a cottage off a country lane. He is very sweet and friendly. I am trying to remember if he gave any clues that he was going to die. (145 words)

["Moving to Alaska."] I moved to Alaska where I am staying with a woman and her husband. She works as a teacher in an elementary school. I go with her to try for a job there myself. We drive through the snow and mud for 10 miles. I am driving a van. A white one. It sure looks like we could get stuck. I'm nervous and careful. We slide through. I remember to keep the gas going fast so we don't bog down and get stuck. It's a curvy road. Then we stop and the woman takes off her high heels (She's wearing a light grey business suit). She walks barefoot in the snow. I wonder how she can stand it. We get into the school through a series of back porch doors. A male teacher is behind me and trying to help open the doors for me, but I hurry ahead and get them myself. I see the woman teacher who will interview me and I shake her hand, being friendly. Trying to impress her. I'll know I'll get the job. She asks which grades I'd prefer to teach. I answer 3rd or 5th. I like the older grades. She complains the big office won't really pay attention to her. I sympathize with her. (212 words)

["Weird interview."] I am at a workshop for some social service agency. A man named "Bob" comes in and talks about his sort of public radio/TV/Internet agency. After the workshop I go over to a small room to do an interview for a job with his agency. He is friendly and talkative. He busies himself dusting the vent door near the ceiling where the computer stuff is stored. It is very dusty. I sympathize. He hands me a curved and long test paper to do. It is very wordy and doesn't ask the straight forward questions I expect. It is confusing and frustrating to fill out. I skip a few questions and have come back to do them. I struggle with my address. SE 40th or is it NW. I try to look it up on my driver's license and other cards. It's all wrong on them too. Then Bob comes back in and interrupts me. He has a rectangular cream colored purse. He thinks it's mine and I left it in another room. I tell him its not mine. I have my small black one (like Ginny's) with me. I am distracted with his conversation. He asks very non essential non related questions. How did I hear of this job opening? What shows do I watch on Fox channel? A disabled show, some news and an occasional movie. I unsnap the question section off its curved answer track. A device that is black and cumbersome. I keep trying to smooth out the curves so I can read the questions and answer them. I realize this is a very right brain work group and I am very left brain. I feel frustrated and aware I'd have to adjust to understanding what they are doing and do it their way. (297 words)

["Killer worms."] I am in a house. A young native American man and several white men come to the house with the intent to enter and be there. I am unsure if they mean me harm. He comes in and wants my company. So does the white man. It seems friendly enough. One gives me a loose cotton dress to wear so I will be more comfortable and more accessible to touch when we lie down on a couch together. It isn't particularly sexual in feeling. I look out a window to see if I have possible escape if I need it. I see a huge ice covered river on both sides of the house, the side and the back, practically right up to the door. It would be dangerous to go that way. Now there are frightening and dangerous animals in the house like swimming moles or something. They are coming toward us. We hit at them and run outside and dive into the river which is no longer snow and ice bound. We are in a small rowboat. These huge long tube worms come at us trying to eat us. We hit at them. It is ineffective. We are in serious danger. One comes right at the boat. And smashes us. We dive into the water to escape it's deadly mouth. Other huge ones slither by wearing a plastic raincoat kind of covering. I grasp at a stick that has a nail at the end and strike the head of the closest worm. It is hurt and retreats. I find a plastic knife and hand it to the man. It is no help. I then find a small paring knife and he uses that. We stab at them as they attack and swim quickly as we can for shore. We manage to escape alive and unhurt. (306 words)

I am frantically cooking. Cheese and meet tacos, omelets and some pastry treat. I also have a glass pot of very hot boiling water going. I see papers on the stove and try to move them from the burners. I push red buttons to see which burners can be turned down or off. The water is nearly over boiling. Finally we get the breakfast cooked and we rush outside with it, after choosing pretty glass plates to put it on so they will look delicious too. My "father's" new Subaru green van is out there and I decide to drive it, we get in and protect the drinks with a box so they won't spill on the way. I can't find the key. My "father" isn't home. I rush back in and ask Ellie where the key is. She finds it and we go back out. I have trouble opening the special double doors. I see two steering wheels, one a small one on the top right of the other regular one. I figure out how to turn it one and where the gas and brake pedals are. We lurch out the driveway. We are in a farm area. Suddenly I see there is no access to the highway., so I turn left toward E City on a dirt access road parallel to the highway, looking for some flat area I can get to the highway from. I see a woman has build a planked structure that might work but it looks flimsy. I ask her if she thinks it will hold our weight. She says sure. I gun across it and turn to get on the highway and see I'm blocked by parked cars. I keep driving until I finally find a way to the highway. Now I am speeding along, enjoying the power of this new vehicle. (347 words)

["Athletic lovers."] I am a high school girl on the basketball team. A high school boy is the best male basketball player and we are pretty equal in prowess. We enjoy the competition of playing well together on the team. There is also a love attraction. I play forward, and seem to be more in a volleyball stance at the non net area. We play hard and enjoy the speed and power. Then he insists I play catcher in a baseball game, another game he is good at. I put on the protective front chest protector and a mitt. I don't know this game as well. He helps me put on the protective gear. We are playing the game in the high school hall and we are at a t corner of two halls. I have to catch and pass a fast ball and hit a small child in the head. I feel terrible. I race over away from her so my next throw won't hurt her. I have to decide which way down the perpendicular hall I must throw. I feel inept in this game and resent the fact that he insists I do this, changing the enjoyment of our teamwork in the basketball game. Now a cheerleader girl comes over and flirts with him and he upset with me, asks her to the dance. I am very hurt. Sad. I accept a date with another jock, but it is the first man I love. Finally he comes to me and touches a deep bone bruise he had created by accidentally hitting me with the baseball in the game. He is remorseful and tenderly realizes he has hurt me. He asks my forgiveness and kisses me gently. We are back together again. (291 words)

["Bill Clinton and energy power grid problems."] I am on a sidewalk in a downtown city. I have a wonderful big black keyboard box with many complicated buttons. I have no idea how to play it but experiment and make some beginning strides toward simple melodies. I am teaching myself how to be more proficient on it. Somehow this box has something to do with electrical power in the city as well. I must drive down a highway to get to the ocean's edge and fix the power grid problem. I am picked up by Bill Clinton in a black car. He is on the same mission. We somehow get past a narrow gate across the road and reach land's end. A restaurant is there, we go in and see they are remodeling so that they will grow the fish in pools there outside the restaurant for the people to eat. I also see a large group of Asian workers in their slickers working the ocean and moving in lines as a group toward shore. Now Bill and I are back in the car backing up that curvy road back to the city. He decides he wants to make out and starts to lie on me. I grab his face and hold him back from a kiss and say. No way, guy. I don't care if you are powerful or could cause me problems, I don't want this. He is annoyed with me. I force my way out of the car to walk back to the city. I am a bit worried he will try and run me over. (262 words)

I try to read the script but the print is very small and the pictures, like yellow beaked Tuku birds are hard to see. I struggle trying to get the character. Then I say wait. I need my glasses.

["Weird roommates from the radio."] I am moving into a house. I enter and begin to look around at the rooms. Suddenly I find I have at least four male roomies that are military pilots. They had already moved in and have their things in drawers and so on. I try and talk to them to find out about how we are going to arrange things. They don't talk to me and ignore me. I am annoyed. Then one of them begins to talk about writing. I find the subject very interesting and begin to answer but he just continues talking, asking me questions and then not giving me a moment to answer. I get increasingly angry and annoyed. He talks about not lecturing and so on in the writing. Then he abruptly leaves, the rest of them going outside with him. I get up. I have a long outer coat on and look into a closet for a place to hang it. I try several times but it falls off the weird elaborate hanging devices. I decide a big hook on the door will work fine. I open the side door to the side yard to see where those roomies went. I see a white cat like creature with a human head. I see the roomies are in the house next door. They continue to ignore me. I decide to walk for a bit outside to help me get over my anger. I walk down the sidewalk past the house the roomies are in, right next door. I see the inside of the house is gutted and a terrible mess. I then see them and their friends in the side yard again. I walk over to them and try to talk to their women friends. They are uppity and silent. I return to the house. I decide to evict them. I go to each one as they wander around the house an invisible eviction letter. They reach out and take it. Finally they all leave and I start examining what rooms I have. I open one door and find an empty narrow small room with a door at the other end. I walk in and see dotted lines on one wall indicating woven drawers, very large ones in the wall. I pull one open and see it could be used as a youth bed. It has a blanket in it. I see there is one snort drawer and two big ones in a row. That's good. Then I see there is now a bathtub on that wall. Now I'm thinking these drawers could be great storage drawers for towels and so on. Much more space and storage than my own house (40th Ave). I then turn and see a wall mounted shower hand held device and am very happy to see this. There is no toilet or sink those are in the next room. I am pleased with this arrangement. A roll in accessible shower room with a tub for the others, such as guests. I then go to the bathroom which has the toilet and sink. This house is changing into a nice place to live. (523 words)

["Quick marriages."] I am teaching in an elementary school. The principal is going to be married to a woman. I am going to be married to another man. But for no apparent reason, we decide we like each others man better and swap. We marry on the instant the last day of school. He and I are walking no from the school building to meet a cousin Viola. She comes up and I introduce my husband explaining the swap. She is very surprised. I also explain my daughter suddenly got married. There are at least three of us couples that just instantly married someone we hardly knew. My man gently supports me to a small platform with an organ on it. It is his organ. But as I play the key, I hear it is a piano and see another platform with an organ on it. That is the real one my husband owns. My cousin disapproves. I feel fine about it. Kind of new and interesting. (165 words)

["Howard returns and it is pleasant."] I live in a house. I wake up to discover Howard is there. He has brought me many gifts. On a table are a selection of a dog's toy collection with mechanical cute toys. One has a metal bumble bee that buzzes around a house. I lie on the couch. I am confused because I can't remember where Howard had been or why he is here. I try to remember if he's been around and I didn't notice or he'd been on a long trip. I do know it has been years since I've seen him. I feel a twinge of guilt that he has been without sex all that time, from me. He lies down on the couch with me. It is gentle and pleasant. I feel a twinge of concern he will want to have sex, but he is friendly and cuddly. I look at his face and see he is more handsome and his hair is prettier than I remember him before. He gets up and brings me more gifts. Cute stuffed animals on a house, with the individual names of each of my daughters and me on each spangly stuffed animal. It is cute. I try and remember where his bedroom used to be. I finally remember it is up stairs, where I can't get to at the end of the hall. I don't know if I want him to stay or not, but I feel good about seeing him again. (245 words)

["Uncle Lionel an actor."] I am in an auditorium where my Uncle Lionel, who I call Grandfather has joined some performance group that teaches about logging and sawing skills. He is showing off his work to me. His troupe all gather around me and are friendly. One man is attracted to me. I am now sitting in an overstuffed chair. The troupe is focusing their show toward me. One man is on my left with a saw devise on the left arm of the chair demonstrating it. Another man is behind me demonstrating something else. I see on the stage area my Uncle a part of an acrobatic piece where they saw in half huge logs of paper rolls and then tumble down into a trampoline safety net. Then more troupers come out, one woman like Bonnie (with stroke) playing the fiddle. Now two dogs come up to me, each carrying candy or a small toy in their mouths for me to have. One is a pink poodle and very clever, returning a small tootsie roll candy back to a small platform around its neck. Someone hands me a kitten. I cuddle it and say oh no. I can't accept another cat. You need to take it away quickly before I can't return it, because I will like it too much. The troupe says "UH-OH" like they made a mistake and take the kitty back. I'm already rethinking the decision. Now I am getting involved in the acting. They move an actor to another room and I follow him. The troupe joins us and I am given a small green animal mask to hold and I am to go back to the audience and say the name of this character. I hear Chris Dilloncake. They frown and repeat the name. I can't seem to understand the last name correctly. It ends up sounding like MobCake. (311 words)

A young teen woman and me (a young teen woman) are on the run from a policeman who is after us. He is ruthless and out to get us. I try and protect my friend but the policeman (plain clothes man) grabs her and drags her with him. He is interrogating her, threatening her, yelling at her. She yells out "Officer Dunn" a kind of officer at a lower level. He hears her and races up to where she is to help protect her. He races right up to the bad cop, in his face, yelling let her go. The bad cop shoves him aside. He had forced her and me to give samples of our blood. We each have our sample in vials in our hands. He demands hers. She tries to fight him off. She manages to throw her vial so he can't get it. She runs toward Officer Dunn. The bad cop comes after me, livid with hate and rage. I run into a small lab room and out again. I yell I threw it away. He sneers and goes into the lab room and picks up a vial. He says if you say you threw it away, then you didn't and this is it. He tips up his head and drinks it down fast. I scream No, No. It was some kind of acid poison. He convulses out of the chair onto the floor screaming in his horror and the pain. Oh, God, he screams. He is seated now cross legged in an upright fetal ball position. He says in pain I mustn't be so loud. I scream Oh God Oh God. As loud as I can. He dies quickly. I wake up hearing both our screams echoing loudly in my mind. Horror. Nightmare. I felt shocked. (301 words)

["Kalua."] I am late getting to school. Enter a classroom where a man and a woman Perry and ? are lying on the floor chatting. We have a small pass along verbal exercises. I take part in them. I am the last one and make a sentence about Perry and ?. Now I am looking for a bathroom. I need to pee. On my way through the rooms, I pick up a small half full/empty glass coffee with Kalua in it. I ask a woman's permission to serve it to a group of men in a meeting room. As they are talking, I realize it is the Repertoire Theatre talking about doing one act plays. I want to talk with them about doing my plays. I ask the first man permission to pour him a small amount. I say I do mean small. I don't have much and hope it will go all around. He barely nods. I say the city gave permission and this is a restaurant so it must be OK. I go to each one and barely have enough to go around. For the last two the thickness is nearly solid. I put too much on one saucer and need to cut it to even it out. (209 words)

["Reindeer ride."] I am at a large family gathering. Long tables in long rows. Many of them. Dinner is over and I walk between the tables collecting small souvenir glasses of various shapes. Small square, short round ones, stemmed small goblets. Dora is there. She had brought the glasses as little gifts. Maybe its Xmas. I decide I want to drive a small sled with one reindeer. They tuck me in under warm blankets and I start slowly, gain confidence. I go around the outside of the tables in a large square. By the 3rd corner I am going very fast and have improved my driving is now quite good. I feel good. (111 words)

["Lots of dreamwork to do."] I am staying for awhile at someone else's house and am trying to keep caught up on my dreamwork stuff and my dream program.

["Beautiful dream pictures."] I am in a house. Family is visiting, like a reunion. Aunt Charlotte, Dwight and Jake and others. A Chinese family is there. A husband and wife, and their two children, a girl and a boy. I am talking to Dwight and Jake as we sit around a round table. Dwight faces me across the table and Jake sits on my right. We are talking about my mortgage. I tell them I hope to sell the houses in a few years and buy another one, build up rentals. It will be my retirement money, I say. The Chinese woman keeps coming over to show me toys and clothes she bought for her children. She unfolds a cardboard cutout of a dress for the girl. She will have time to grow into it as it is taller than she is. The boy pops by and shows me some face painting mask on his face. I like the colors and compliment him on the look, although it is half rubbed off and smudged now. The Chinese man now sits on my right where Jake was (the brothers are gone now) The children flit in and out showing me what the mother got them. I keep getting interrupted by their energy. They want to share and then pull away and don't want to share. They bring me some pictorial images of their dreams. At first, they look like paintings on newsprint paper with narrative written like on a scroll. I notice the girls clouds with the structure of the world globe map, countries outlined, is very similar to the father's picture. He says they did their dream pictures at the same time so I assume she is using his dream images. I tell the man I am a professional DreamWorker, being a counselor. He is hesitant to show me his dream, but after I say that, he is now eager to share. They are now like 3-d cutout boxes, like a pop up in a book or greeting card. With an additional pop up box added with a house and landscape. I compliment him on the beauty of his presentation of the dream. I say usually people put dreams in a narrative form. I have long been interested in creating a visual pictorial form of sharing the dream. I am excited with his 3-d cut out images. (394 words)

I step in and show him how to listen well to them and paraphrase and be assertive. I demonstrate to him how to do this with a woman waitress. She responds well to my communication.

["Speech contest."] I am with a few people in a room. Someone says we should give our speeches now. I am not prepared yet. I'd been making notes but I hadn't practiced it yet. I say ok and go to the front of the room and improvise as best I can. I am talking about four toys I hold in my hand. A thin green rubber figure, a squarish pink thing, and two others. As I give the speech, I realize this is merely a rehearsal and wish it were the real contest because I'm doing OK and don't want to have to do it again. I finish and then it is time for the contest in the other room. I go there and sit quickly down on a weird single bed with a rubbery covering. It bounces another speaker around suddenly. The judges (several women) have spiked hair do's. I remember I had just washed my hair and hurriedly brush it to get the tangles out. Now I am back in the other room looking for the judges grade on my speech. I look through a pile of papers seeing numbers and dates and letter grades. The pile goes from A'' to B'' to C''. I don'' see mine. I keep searching for it. I hope I at least got a B. (221 words)

I am walking from the street to my apartment through the yard. A man with thick dark hair in a business suit, good looking and then stands there waiting for me. I see it is "Bill Domhoff." I greet him, I am pleasantly surprised to see him. He says I'm here in town to see the Red Bridge opening ceremony. I say you are here in E City? He says yes. I say well, come on in. I see he is standing by a white budding rosebush which is near the wall of the building. He smiles and we begin to walk toward the door. I somehow get a large prickly sticker caught in my left big toe. It hurts. I say I can't reach it to pull it out. I hop down a weird staircase where the wood rails are sort of like gymnastic beams, in dark wood. One step is very long and deep so I must hang on to it with my arms around it and dangle as I go hand over hand down. I make it to the entry door and we go in. I see my father, a very old dottering man with a very serious deaf hearing problem. I ask him to help take the sticker out of my toe. Bill waves his hand in front of my father's face to see if he's alive. My father didn't hear or see us and mumbles and walks away. I ask Bill to help me. I feel embarrassed to ask him to touch my possibly stinky toes. With Bill is a tall good looking man named Dustin Hoffman only he looks like Clint Eastwood. He ends up looking like Clint. Starts out short and lots of dark hair. When I ask Bill to help me with my toe, I ask anyone in the room generally if they'll help. Too embarrassed to ask directly. I am trilled that Dustin is there and hope I can work the fact that I am a scriptwriter into the conversation. I am very hopeful I will be discovered by him and become rich and famous. I'm also glad Bill is there and ask him what he'd like to do while in E City. I'd be happy to show him around. Now Dustin Hoffman is a little upset. An important award he has is in some jeopardy of being broken. We go to another room. A man is pinned and caught on a rope up on the wall and the rope is attached to the award/art piece. A cello with climbing ivy like plants artistically growing up out of the top of the cello. If Dustin clips the rope the award will fall and be ruined. He is upset. I say, I can help you. I am confident and cheerful. I am still hopping a bit because the sticker is still in my toe. They are both worried that I will damage the cello art piece. I pull on the rope and up goes the cello and down comes the man with in my reach. It is now Bill. I must pull his head toward my shoulder to reach the pin holding him on the rope. We are chatting in a friendly manner. I am listing things I have. I mention negligee. He murmurs provocatively I'll bet you don't have them anymore (joking me about my long time without sex.) and I smile provocatively and murmur "Oh yes, I do still have them." We smile at each other flirting. I get him unpinned and released. Now I must pull the original man down to me. He's an old silly professor that now looks like a cute chimp. I hold the chimp in my arms and unhook him from the rope. Dustin/Clint is very happy to have his award back unharmed. I try to read the small engraved plaque with it to see what he got the award for. I can't read it (small print), but I guess he did some humanitarian thing he's being thanked for. (674 words)

I've just moved into an apartment. A weird crazy man walks in. He grabs a male guest and ties him up and tortures him. I am in the kitchen. Bonnie and another woman are there. I feel fear. I feel guilty for not doing anything to help the man, but if we try and help him, we might get tortured. I try and clean up the kitchen, washing some dishes. Something catches fire on a burner. I try and put out the fire. I see a cell phone and try to find the emergency number to reach the police. I remember 911 and dial it. A woman receptionist answers from some company. I am very surprised. It isn't 911. I whisper so the crazy man won't hear me, although he comes into the kitchen and glares at me suspiciously. I try and tell her the address, I can't remember it because I just moved in. I think the street is Durban Court and the apartment number is 58. I feel very inadequate. I tell her about the man and ask her about the man and ask her to call for help for me. She says no. I am shocked. I hang up and go to the open doorway of the kitchen. I see the man has put objects like matches and pens between the eyeballs and the lower lids. The trapped man doesn't dare move. I feel badly for him. I go back into the kitchen and try to look up the number for 911. I can't find it. Suddenly I see the trapped man is released and in the kitchen behind the stove. He asks me what were we all doing while he was being tortured. I feel guilty and quickly explain I had been trying to call for help. Did he know the number for 911? Or the address? I can't remember the address. Someone knocks on the front door. The crazy man goes to the door and opens it. A man thinks this is his apartment. I take this moment while the crazy man is distracted and go out into the hall and look up above the door for the apartment number. 61. At least I know that now. I hope I hadn't moved into the wrong apartment. Then I see the crazy man is also out in the hall. I hesitate, afraid and then I go in and shut the door locking it. Two doors. The trapped man is worried. If we try and lock him out he'll get angry and want revenge. I am worried about that too but I do it anyway. I lean against the door. The lock seems weak. I think of moving a heavy bookcase up against the door. The crazy man returns and pounds on the door. The door is about to break. Then the crazy man oozes through under the door jam. He is now a "small person." I grab him by the throat and try to strangle him while I hold him up. I go out to the hall and throw him in the elevator. I yell at him not to come back! (525 words)

I am in a house. My brother Dwight is visiting. He brought my parents. They are old, sick and frail. I'm not feeling so strong myself. Dwight decides to leave. I realize he's leaving my parents there and I'll have to take care of them. I call after him. No. This isn't fair. I tell Dwight I have to work at my job. I can't be here all the time. He leaves. My mother needs to use the bathroom. My father decides to go downstairs to nap. I show my mother the upstairs bathroom. It is short like a vanity under the sink. I tell her it will be very uncomfortable for her. I open the vanity door. It is impossible for anyone to use that bathroom. I give up and am tired so I go downstairs leaving my mother alone, lying on a couch. I go down a long hall remembering my bedroom is at the end and to the left. It's been years since I've seen this bedroom. I see the bathroom door on the right. I go into my bedroom. (Old house, like recurring many roomed old houses in other dreams.) Charla comes in. I ask her to help me make my bed. She agrees. Then I see a worm on the folded bedspread (white) at the foot of the bed. I ask her to remove the worm because I don't want to touch it. She turns her back on me and says no. I get furious. I scream at her. Do you want to fight? I'll lose control, is that what you want? I am daring her to not be helpful so I can hit her and scream at her. She ignores me. (287 words)

["Dreams."] I am at a person's house. We are having a meeting of the dream group, a group of women. We are going to decide on what structures we will agree on for when we do dreamwork. We convene and a medical doctor is here especially to help us work out our structure. I welcome him. Then I read from a typed list of suggestions made so far. A student from a University makes one suggestion. Howard has another. It is about things coming from the same part of the brain and you must focus on that area. I have a question about whether or not the title or the date should be written first. A long fancy letter from a group called Lovely(Thing? Thoughts? moments?) from Arizona is talking about what they do as a group. Now we are preparing for the potluck meeting. The room is small and square and up one half level. I put some kind of food on the table. Someone knocks on the door. I walk down to the large living room and across it to the door. I let in a women. I walk back toward the dream room. Another knock. This repeats a number of times as couples, well dressed and women come in with lots of food. I realize there will not be enough room for everyone in the small room, so I contemplate moving it into the living room. The owner of the house is somewhere in the kitchen. The phone rings. I say hello but the woman at the other end can't hear me. She is confused. Apparently she was trying to call The Emporium. I keep trying to speak to her. Later another woman asks me if the higher level rooms are accessible. I say no, they aren't. I am not real happy with all these couples. (I am reminded of the my discussion circle group.) (317 words)

["Sharon's mother."] I am outside a house. Preparing for something. We'd been making decorations and signs and so on for some meeting. I need a little break from all the noise and people. I pace back and forth in the drive way. There is a pack of nuts. I want to eat them all. But I only eat some, so I don't mess with my diet. I realize Sharon's mother is coming to help with the preparations. For some reason, I don't want to meet with her, but I must. So I put the nuts down in the garage and walk out to the driveway to meet her. She is going to create a thing that will go on the roof of the house. It will incorporate a boy who created a special dance step. (133 words)

["The river rises."] I live in a tiny one room cabin on a high rocky bank of a river out in the expansive plains. Rocky and rough terrain like around M City. Fluffy is playing. I see her down in the now empty river bed. I go down there and stand in the dry river bed. Fluffy is sunning herself and playing. I look up river to the bend. I see white water coming around the corner. I vaguely remember hearing they were temporarily stopping the river flow at the dam for maintenance. They must have released it. I see what looks like kids on black inner tubes riding the wave. I turn and pick up Fluffy and run back up to the cabin. I think about getting in the van and driving fast away. But I decide the river probably won't get up so high it will flood the cabin. The river rushes down the bed and rises quickly. It is at the foundation of the cabin. I think maybe I made a mistake and now its too late. I will be trapped in the cabin. And can't drive away on the flooded plains. I look again and the river has evened out. I will be safe. Later, I drive into the country store. A man comes up to me. An acquaintance of me and my husband. He is attracted to me and wants me. I excitedly tell him about the close encounter with the river. He comes up very close and grabs my arms. He wants to make love. I try to struggle out of his embrace. He is very insistent. I tell him if he doesn't release me right now I will scream rape. He hesitates and then releases me. I drive back to the cabin. (296 words)

Traveling on work, I guess. The daughter is cute and smart. She has two neighbor friends (male) over and they are playing. One boy is typing on a toy machine and asking interview questions. I think this will be good skill building for him. (76 words)

["I don't belong here."] Anastasia invites me to a real estate social evening. 3 women. Ann, Anastasia and a 3rd in a long . Smoozing. Some business dresses, some fancy clothes. It's like we are at an art gallery room. I see a man I used to act in a play with him. I remember a touching moment we had at some other gathering like this. He had a series of miniature oil paintings his father had painted of a piece of property he loved. Vibrant Van Gogh like paintings. Black crows flying up off a straw field, a whirlwind of straw rising to the sky. The color red. Other paintings blues and purples is sky and sunset. Cobalt blue. I find some paintings that remind me of that time. I see Perry sitting alone by a wall. I walk to him and share these paintings with him. It is tender and sweet and sad. He's a bit plump and older now. Anastasia comes over and I say I'm here because she insisted I be there. Perry says you look like you belong here (dressed up, smoozing). I say sadly I don't belong here. The only part that means anything to me is your paintings and us talking. Perry looks sad and goes away. I say to Anastasia I get so hungry for someone like Perry. Oh, I know he's probably an alcoholic and not right for me. But I so want that connection. Anastasia gently touches my arm and says I know. But I love you. I say I know. Friends. But I want THAT kind of love. We walk out the room into the moonlight where the silvery dresses of the women and their clients waft around. Anastasia says I know one room where you can have your feelings. We go to a museum room where beautiful cobalt blue and other colors of flat artistic bowls are displayed. People, sad lonely people, make ritualistic circular motions around the edges of these bowls. One woman croons once I made a metal one thin out. I see 2 older men looking at photos of his father's paintings. The father had died the last year. They mourn for him. I with wild sadness circle and circle the bowl with my dancing hands. (377 words)

I am on an expedition to retrieve case notes from my Mexico trip. It is time to write the book based on my research. I ask several Mexican men to help me carry the piles of notes and papers through the woods to the right place. One leaves early another later. I realize I may have put my notes in jeopardy by not keeping them together and supervised. I follow the trail. I can't carry them all myself. I tried. But now I am on a very tall mountain. The owner of the company, a man is showing me what it is like to work in the high altitudes. With so little oxygen, it is dangerous work. I follow him down paths. I see the sheer rock cliff faces we are working on. In order to sleep, you have to strap yourself into a device and be sprayed with sleeping drugs. Then you wake up and continue. The food is odd. A dandelion fluff like thing you nibble on. It is cold and difficult to work. We are mining. Now the man says you find the right way to get to the mine. He'd led me once. I have a very hard time remembering the right paths. Finally, I see I took a wrong path, but I got there anyway. So I learned that all paths lead to the mine. Other workers are there. We are isolated up there. so we are friends to each other. A man feels sad because his love is far away. A woman worker empathizes with him. They talk it over. Another woman worker is going to take a bit of time off and have fun exploring the steep difficult terrain. I feel my irregular heart beat and realize this is taking a huge toll on me physically. I wonder if I will survive it. The mines are important. (314 words)

I have apparently bought a huge very nice house with a large entry way and a banquet sized dining room kitchen. A heated swim pool in the back yard. Lydia and her children (high school age) are visiting me. I mop the entry way. I have to walk what looks like a mile to the other end of the house it is so big. I wonder why I chose to have such a large house at this age of my life with the kids growing up and moving out. I like the house but the work keeping it up is a lot. I go out and swim in the pool. I am under water and floating toward the surface. I then see a man watching me from an upstairs window in the neighbors house. He's living there for the summer, writing a novel. He comes over because I invited him to have ice cream with me and talk writing. I tell him I am writing a novel too. (168 words)

["Eastern Indian sexual rituals."] I am watching as the men of eastern India hand a small metal square to a woman they are in relationship with. She sits on it so that the vagina lips touch the metal and then she is consumed by sexual passion and they make love. I watch as one couple after another do this. Some of the women have figured out how to have their own metal square and chose the man they want. I see Bootsie has been chosen by another cat. She sits in a pretty ceramic bowl and he has his bowl right next to her. He is kind to her. I am glad for her. I am also concerned because a black cat who is not kind is near by and if the kind cat leaves it will take over. A dark skinned black curly haired tall man wants a beautiful daughter of the house and tries to catch her with his square. I feel very sexually excited. (163 words)

["Bette Midler retires."] I see Bette Midler walking across a lawn talking with people. I understand she is retiring now. I sit in a car, in the passenger side. Bette comes over, curious and gets in the driver's side. Perhaps I had signaled her to come over. She waits to see what I have to say. I tell her I loved her song "The Rose" the best. She says her too. I say my friend Lucy who has a beautiful singing voice sang it and I would harmonize with her. I would cry every time I sang it. I ask her if she will miss performing and singing. I'll bet she would. She smiles and I say quickly, but then maybe you just want to sit by the swim pool eating watermelon. She smiles and agrees that's all she wants to do now. It would give her great pleasure. (146 words)

It is a relief. It might be too late to drop them without a grade drop, but I don't care. I don't want to be taking these classes any more. (92 words)

I am excited about sharing my results from my dream program. I have lots of numbers. I call a man over to where I am working. I tell him I want to show him my results. He's an official. Then I get the attention of a woman, well known in dreams, who becomes curious about all my numbers. I am trying to explain my dream program to her. There is a man near. I know we like each other but I don't know why. A mysterious feeling of knowing him. Then I see a group of men in brown security guard uniforms, all wearing masks of famous people. They sit like they were on a plane or train. I begin to feel fear. Something awful is happening and I am afraid. I keep forgetting things. The woman runs. I say to the man, are we moving? Are we moving? It feels like we are on some vehicle. Then the woman runs out screaming hysterically "Why would they want to kill me?" over and over. I wake up, feeling fear. Night terror? or Nightmare? (183 words)
Barb Sanders #2:#4053 (02/16/01)

I must remember to write down what's happening. I call that official man out of his office to look over the weird things that happened over my dream program. He looks like he's in a trance. The man I am attracted to is still there. We don't remember why we met or how, just that we love each other. A pretty woman is there. Everyone else is gone. I look with fear down a flight of stairs. "They" are down there. We have to protect ourselves from the aliens. The mayor and several other people stand around in a trance. I and the man's mother move into a room. She lost lots of weight and her clothes are huge, nearly falling off her. We gasp. Proof. Time has passed, but not normally. I notice with irony even under these circumstances I don't lose weight. Now these few other people are coming back in with rags on. That's all that's left. Decaying rotting rags. The pretty woman still looks pretty even though her clothes are mismatched. I think that is ironic as well. We must remember to gather and store water. To survive. A man points to a circular patterned woven basket mat in a front window of a house. Bees. He says in fear. They are like bees. We begin to run to find a place to hide. Little bees appear near us and try to sting us. We swat at them. We run into a room with a bathroom and try to lock the doors. They won't lock no matter how hard I try. I say get some pots. I turn on the faucet for water and plug the sink. The pretty woman brings small paper cups "because they are prettier." She said. Even she realizes this is illogical and non survival like. I try and fill the sink but the water escapes down the drain. I am afraid and continue to try and lock the doors. Holes appear. They are coming. I wake up. Fear like monsters are under the bed. Nightmare. (344 words)

I decide to find out where the male director lives. I see the back end of my van as I drive down a street looking for him, only he is now a she. Lisa, not Perry. She sees me drive by. I see me turn left, pretending I am lost. Now me the observer sees a woman in a wheelchair who says she leaned into the experience too much and fell over backwards and hurt herself. Now I see a pretty woman from last dream walking down a sidewalk perpendicular from the wheelchair woman. Now I am running with her and we are at exactly the same place as the end of the last dream. We race into the bathroom and try to lock the doors. This time the doors lock good. I realize the alien is in the pretty woman and say to it, show yourself. Another irony. I had just locked myself IN with the alien. The pretty woman falls back on the toilet unconscious, like the alien will come out of her. I try to see the alien. Nothing is there. The doors are secured. I feel OK. I wake up. (194 words)

I am at a store, garage area. I'm trying to convince an Asian woman to back my play. She keeps popping in and zipping off. She won't sit still and hear my proposition. She gets on a motorcycle like contraption and goes down the street with a boy (9 or 20) on her lap. She helps this guy who owns the store, garage to do business better. She waves her foot which is oddly shaped a bit like a hand. I see she holds her right arm like the hand is missing. She's laughing and playing as she goes on around the corner. I sit there disappointed. I wanted her to back my play. Then the older man owner, comes by and we talk. I share my disappointment with him. He says what the hell, he'll help. All I need is $100,000. As I am thinking I haven't got $100,000. He's asking if I want the 2PM and 9PM dinner breaks catered. I nod yes, I need to find Sparky's (The Asian Woman)'s phone number she gave me. The man and I walk down a road. We are attracted to each other and chatting. I see my plaid blanket on the side of the road with other blankets. I say who put my blanket out here. I am teasing him because he did, made a bed there last night and its really his blanket anyway. Then we get to my room. Lots of books on shelves like a store front only its my bedroom. The man is curious to see my room. I suddenly remember I left the phone number up at his store. I say I'll run up and get it. I run part way back up the road and then fall off the road on the right side. It's like a room with a wall. I get back up, embarrassed. 2 older men are there, the owner and some other nice man. Now there's a slider door across the road. I open the door. A young man jokes about needing to pee. I shut the door, remembering I have the phone number in my room. I go back to my room passing a grandmotherly plump woman seated by Charla saying "She's grown so much since I've seen her. I agree. Then the owner asks me a question and I sigh saying I don't have $100,000. It's a relief to be honest and say that. He asks how much I have. I say $10,000. He says OK. We'll do it. (421 words)

I see Sparky and ask her to stay for a few minutes and hear the dream I had about her. As I describe how she was willing to back my play in the dream, I realize its like asking her to back me now. She smiles and says like Celeste so name the term you want to be in another play. I say OK. That will be fun. It will be nice to be in the Center for another performance. I ask her to list the future productions coming up. I also ask her if I can submit a play to her for consideration. She agrees I can submit it. Then she offers me a couple of vegetarian like hamburgers with some purple like cabbage like veggie on the side. There are four varieties of this slightly hot and spicy veggie. I taste it and it is very delicious. I eat it all. I thank her for the food. Then there is an actor, Richard Gere who visits. (168 words)
Barb Sanders #2:#4057 (02/17/01)

Now the actor Richard Gere behaves like Jim Carrey. Making outrageous jokes. He is funny and annoying at the same time. Cute but pushy. He wants to watch a video with me. He chooses one called "The Thing" I say oh no. Is this that really scary one? We start watching. It's a horror story, but I realize I'd seen it before. A woman with arthritis. No so scary after all, just an OK story. I get bored and go upstairs. I see Ellie lying in a child'' bed trying to sleep. As I am walking up the stairs, I see a man and woman getting ready to be married. They wear fancy clothes that are red silk and silver sequins. Matching shoes. She can't get her shoes to fit right and stay on. He ridicules her as they bicker up the stairs. I point out a steep hill that represents Ginny and Ernie's relationship. A strong together relationship. Now I am back in the room with Richard Gere and Ellie and a small child, a girl, and Ginny. I am helping the girl do some task. Richard keeps interrupting with Jim Carrey tricks. I say jokingly who let this guy in anyway. I realize it was me that invited him in. A friend of Sparkey's. (216 words)

["Spider woman ritual."] I apparently have a Mexican father named Jamisma and a Native American mother. I am accused to stealing a special bridal dress of a native American woman. I say I am innocent. They are very angry at me. Now my "father" shows me a large silver broach filigree work and a center turquoise stone. Caught under that broach is a huge spider. My "father" is afraid to touch it or let it crawl on him. I am too. I watch it closely when it moves, afraid it will come at me. After a long time doing that, my "father" then allows it to crawl on his shoulder. He says the spider is mostly dead now. Maybe completely dead. He asks me where we should put it. I say put it in the garbage can. If it is alive, it can feed on the food there and survive. He agrees, He thinks of piercing it's center colored spot on the belly to put it out of its misery. But if it has a chance to live, he agrees to let it try. He takes it out. I then go into a room. The ritual ceremony is about to begin. My "mother" begins it. She moves around me, talking. There is some large cannon shaped object that my "father" positions and fires off. A lot of stuff floats down from the shot. It is positioned several times and fired. I am concerned the spider will return. Now the angry Native American girl glares at me and demands I return the bridal dress for her ceremony. I look at her and say empathetically "I understand." But I can't return it. I didn't take it. Apparently there was some accident that happened to it, and that may have happened because of me. But the girl wants retribution. (303 words)

I am a beautiful fold singer singing for a very colorful crowd of 90 people all crowded, standing around me. At first they look like colorful cloth objects. Then I see they are people. I have dark slightly curly long hair. I play a mandolin. My playing is intricate and beautiful. I manage to get unusual melodic complex sounds out of this simple folk instrument. The audience loves me. I sing song after song. I see the scene now from behind me. I see a cloth spread out with cassette tapes of my music to sell and food and a big glass bowl of water for the audience. Now a tall good looking man comes behind me and opens a hinged window, like a hatch back car window. This changes the dynamics of the sound and makes it a bit harder to sing. I keep on, compensating for the change. He is interested in me. I am attracted to him. I say I'll sing two more songs. Lots of applause. I sing one of my "favorite" tunes. "Gold Rings." It's about a man offering a gold ring and relationship and I am interested, but then I am glad I refused the gold ring because then I'm free of doing the dishes and helping him and losing my music and freedom. Now the concert is over. A young woman comes up to talk. She wears a large plastic shopping bag over her head. She has a question. Can I tell her how to sing a particular note? I ask her to take off the bag so when we talk I can see her eyes. She shyly takes it off slowly. She mentions a boyfriend. I say, it is possible to have both your music and a boyfriend but you have to decide which one is priority. My music comes first, I say this so the attractive man can hear. He seems to understand. He waits for the woman to go and we walk off together pleasantly getting acquainted. (337 words)

["I can walk now."] I am in a wheelchair at perhaps a University. Friendly people and I are going from one building to another. Lots of stairs everywhere and no ramps. I drive my wheelchair up a short flight of cement stairs. I make it, quite surprised that I did. And pleased. I then see the left wheel is frayed and damaged, coming apart. I look down a long flight of stairs. Too long to drive the chair down. I see another back flight of stairs made of wood and flatter longer steps, more gradual. I decide the chair won't work anymore and decide I will attempt to sit on my butt and scoot down step by step. A woman stands at my left and I stand out of the chair and balance, leaning on her arm for support. Then I take a step and successfully manage the first step. I try a second step and one by one I successfully walk down the full flight of stairs. I am ecstatic. I can walk now. A male professor, friendly is in the background somewhere. (180 words)

Then a group of able bodied dancers join me. We do this choreographed number involving tap dancing. I have a board where my foot pedals were and I tap with them.

["Jake, Lydia and me cleaning up."] Jake, Lydia and Me are living in a house together. I think it used to be my parents house, although I've never seen it before. There are two kitchen areas. I am in the room that is like a rec room, only there is a stove. I see it has a gas burner and it is on. The flame shoots high up and I worry that it will catch something on fire. I turn it off. It goes out and then pops back on. It is apparently the pilot light. One spark singes an eyebrow hair I got too close. I open the oven door and see it is on too. There are hamburger patties cooking and a chocolate cake with chocolate and green icing trim. I get a spatula and take them out a piece at a time. I suggest Jake eat some now. I then try and clean up the top of the stove. Lydia is in the kitchen doing dishes. Now we walk down a hall. I point to the floors of the various rooms where carpet had been ripped up and blotches of an ugly green carpet residue is all over the floor in patches. We go into an almost empty room, like a living room. A TV and a recliner chair is there. The TV is at one long end and the chair is clear at another. I suggest me move the chair closer to the TV. I then see it is plugged in and ask Lydia if there is another outlet in the room. We see one. I have to use an adapter plug, but we set it up. I sit in the chair and decide to color for awhile. I pull out a few crayons and chalks and a poster picture. It is a fuzzy dragon creature. I start with giving it pink hair. I want it to be purple on the body. As I color, I look again and it is a curvaceous woman. I am coloring her skin green. I have a yellow chalk I pick up accidentally and color for awhile. Then a large giant stuffed monster kind of creature is in the room. He and all his stuff is at the far end. He doesn't want us there coloring. I say well, if we promise not to come near your side of the room and not color anything of yours is it ok if we stay? He says yes. Now the picture is a man in an outdoor cooking apron. I continue coloring. (424 words)

["Gardens in the hall."] I am walking down a long hall in an apartment building. The hall area in front of every apartment door is decorated like an indoor garden, each one uniquely different. I see the pretty waterfalls and hanging plants. And statuary. They are very lovely. The apartment I am being shown is at the very end of the hall. I go in and it looks very nice, a red brocade couch. I need to go talk to the landlord and make arrangements. The man showing me the apartment gives me a special outfit I must wear for this interview. It is a formal pink gown with a ruffly stole that goes around my face and shoulders, up to my eyes. We go up to the top floor and I go to the door. I see odd letters that I think are dutch words but they look more Arabic or Chinese. This is the list of roommates that live in this apartment. I timidly knock on the wall near the door. Then I knock louder on the door. I wait. (178 words)

["Nice older couple and betrayal."] I am at a women's workshop. We are all sitting on the floor. I see a nice older couple who walk around together, arm in arm. They seem to be kind to each other and love each other. Susie is the lecturer or rather facilitator. As I am watching, the man suddenly says to the woman, "Maybe I'll just rape you." I do a double take I am so surprised. She almost doesn't hear it. The whole group goes silent in shock. The woman withdraws her arm and steps back. The man then walks away from her in obvious pursuit of a young pretty woman. He now wears a long black robe with stars and moons on it, like a wizard robe. He is seated with women around him like a harem. The old woman is distraught. I say to her, hold my hand. I will support you. She takes my hand and begins to walk like pacing in a circle around and around dragging me along. I have a hard time keeping up. She then lunges to the man throwing herself prostrate on the ground in front of him. Clutching his legs. We are all shocked and disapproving. She begs him to let her stay with him. (208 words)

I like him and he me immediately. It is special and wonderful. He's walking me home. I want him to see my apartment. I open the door. It looks like a reception area of an office. A male secretary is there. I say good afternoon, walk through the small room to a door behind his desk. I open it and we enter a huge cavernous room where wonderful large wood carvings adorn the high cave like walls. A young priest is there and we talk. We are old friends. The man I like/love is good with my son. He's wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. He is interested in everything about me, including my magic like apartment. I say you have to see this . I push open a slim corner cupboard door. This is very important says my son. I push a lazy susan shelf and it goes around showing boxes and a china tea set. A couple of cups rattle as I push it around to show him. I have a tea set I say whimsically. There had been some jealousy between he and the priest. The priest is an old friend of mine. I turn and reach out my arms to the man. We embrace lovingly. It feels so right, so wonderful. The priest is disappointed and leaves. As we cling to each other, the man says in a love choked voice, I think I'll wear a white jacket. My son says "Whoa!" I freeze and pull back slowly. He is confused and says what? My son shakes his head sadly. I want to marry you, he says. I pull back further, very sad. I love him. I love being with him but marriage is impossible. He tries to back track. It's OK. No man, but the moment is gone. It will be over and I feel deeply sad. It had been so special and loving. (348 words)

He wears an odd smooth mask that covers his face like the blue men of IBM commercial or like Jim Carrey in The Mask, a movie. He and I begin to come closer to make love. We lie down on a bed and we kiss sensuously. It feels wonderful. The mask disappears. I begin to take off his clothes. I am sexually excited. I am on top. It is a tender and erotic experience.

["Visiting mom."] I am outside at what is supposedly my parents' house. But I've never seen it before. I am packing to go back home. I am going through some things on a bench. My mother comes out and says something negative. I respond with a statement that indicated she made a mistake about what she was saying about me. I did it with some calmness. My mother goes back in the house. I pick up some books. I'd left there at the last visit. My baby photo album with writing in it. And so on. I pick up a small paperback book with the title "Literary Edits" and think, that's my mother's book. I leave it on the bench. There is a baby somewhere. I get all my things packing into a cardboard box, square. The mostly eaten white cake on a rectangular plate was a bit too much. So I take that back out and now there is just enough room for all my things. I lay the photo album on top. Now I wonder how to get this heavy box carried to the car which my father had gone to get. I think I'll wait until help comes. But then I decide to try and push it up the steep hill as far as I can manage. I bend down and shove it slowly up the hill. I manage well getting to a t intersection of another sidewalk. Suddenly, a brown narrow vehicle which from the front looks like a very thin VW bug. My mother is driving it. I yell at her, Hey look out, I'm here. She didn't see me and almost ran over me. I step off the sidewalk in the grass. She stops and gets out. She says she's sorry she said what she said. I said It's Ok, but I haven't really forgiven her. I just wish to get on with business and not deal with it. Like it is finished business and I don't need to give energy to it. I am a little cool toward her. I walk around behind the vehicle wondering where I will sit and how the box will fit. I see a square space on the back with a mesh wire side. The box will fit there just fine. I notice she has several smaller versions of this vehicle parked on the lawn and a tiny one like a toy. I think my father must have bought them for her so she can get around better and be more independent. (422 words)

["Going to Las Vegas."] I am in some large room with Aunt Millie. We are talking about a workshop I attended that she is very interested in learning about. Some man and a woman, who had been featured on the Oprah Winfrey show. I said I could teach her the stuff I learned. She wants to learn. We are sitting on a large sort of couch platform chatting. Now we get up and walk across the room to a small kitchen area. Millie is mixing up some whipped cream in an unusual way. She has it poured out in a rectangle shape on what looks like a grill on a stove. She uses a whisk and the color of the cream is a milky blue. I comment on the unusual way she is doing it. I am interested. As she does this, I tell her that the three things that are most important to learn from the workshop is you must have a goal, drive and motivation. As we are talking I become aware of possible danger. It seems we are on a large ocean ship and huge whales, hairy black scary ones, are circling the ship. They are coming to eat us. I feel worried. I look out and see them deep in the ocean coming closer. One very hairy one surfaces and goes back down. I move toward the center of the room. I need to look in cupboards. I begin to open a large cupboard like a closet. I see a baby's hand poke out. Aunt Millie is very upset and says don't open that! Now I wonder if there's a dead or hurt baby that's been in there for a long time and did Aunt Millie have something to do with that? I try to shut the door again but it won't shut, the stuff that's in it won't go back in enough to shut. The feeling of fear now. A man suddenly enters the room from a door that leads to an elevator. He's come for us. Aunt Millie is going somewhere bad, like she will die. I think I am going with her, but the man says to me, No, you are going to Las Vegas. I walk into the elevator relieved it's not my time to die yet. (381 words)

["Picking up the garbage."] I am with a performance group. I am packing things. I go outside where a lot of garbage is piled up on a parking strip along a street. Lots of it is dead leaves, but there are lots of old broken things too. A lovely golden retriever dog comes to help pick up the garbage. She begins to work where the leaves are piled up. I and another woman are looking over the junk. She picks up a small clock. She says it works but it doesn't stop. I say well, that's because it's broken, sort of sarcastic, because it's in the junk pile for a reason, I would think. I look back where the dog is working and I am very impressed with how much she has accomplished. Long areas of fresh grass is exposed where the piles of dead leaves used to be. (145 words)

["Little blue aliens."] I am living in a run down apartment building. I want to go to the bathroom. I open the door out to the hall, as the bathroom is in another room across the hall. I see water all over the floor. I see Ellie in the bathroom as the door is open. She is looking at me concerned because there is water coming out of everywhere in the bathroom. She gestures for me to come see. I walk in and see water several inches deep on the left side of the room. I am concerned. I decide to go to the stairs at the right end of the hall. I open that door and see flooding water rising almost to our floor level. I am worried now. I go to the left end of the hall and find an odd sort of stone dungeon door which swings open to reveal a flight of old rough hewn stone stairs. I hear water flowing from somewhere, just as I heard water flowing at the other stairs. I walk down the stairs cautiously and round a bend to see that the stairs now went back up and around another corner. I see water flowing out of the ceiling in a corner. I go back to the hall and try and find my apartment. We have to get out of here. I look in one room near the left end and see a group of odd little blue men, obviously aliens. I grab one by the neck and hold a tree branch which forks at the end in my left hand. The alien is very afraid and breathes loudly. I realize they think the tree branch is a weapon as I hold it pointed at them like a gun. The group wants to rush me and save their companion, but are afraid to do it. There's another one of them at the right end of the hall and I keep swinging my neck back and forth to keep a wary eye on them all. I realize my right hand is at just the right place on the aliens neck to choke him if I have to. He knows that too. I make him walk with me as I look for Ellie and some kind of exit. I call to Ellie to find a fire escape. She says she found one in the bathroom. I walk, with the alien there, get to the window. Ellie goes down the fire escape. I release the alien and dart out the window and on down. The alien is very surprised I didn't kill or harm him. He realizes now I was just defending myself. I look back up and realize they are water breathing creatures and are filling the building up so they can survive. (467 words)

["Searching with kittens on my head."] A man shows me a video and tells me to watch closely. I watch trying to memorize all the objects and sequences. It's a test of some kind. The man watches me closely to see how I will do. After the complex video is done, he places many objects in boxes and pouches and tells me to search for a knife. I remember seeing a plastic like knife similar to a letter opener. On the video and begin looking where I think it might be. I search through a box, then along the table and then in a pouch and can't find it. I am frustrated. I keep searching over and over. Another woman now joins the search. It's a contest now. A small kitten is nearby. I think it is cute and pet it. I pick it up. The man adjusts its position so it is right under my chin to cuddle up by my neck. I would have preferred that the kitten be in my arms so I could enjoy looking at it. Now there are two kittens. Now they are on my head and I balance them as I continue the long search. Another man enters the room. I signal to him secretly where's the knife! I had found a pouch with a regular looking knife, but my memory was of a letter opener type. He points his head at the pouch. I mouth Is it the regular knife. He nods. The watching an is watching this even though we are trying to be hidden from him. I'm just not finding anything. It isn't going well. (269 words)

I am awake but in a hospital bed in "my" room. I have a small ceramic bowl with lots of little things in it. It keeps slipping and stuff falls out on the bed. Then Bonnie comes in and gets on the bed. I'm a bit annoyed because its very early in the morning. I toss a small ceramic "angel" at her. Here, I say, a gift. She says Oh, God! In frustration. It was such a graceless act of giving. Off handed. I just wanted to get rid of it. She goes into the bathroom and comes back. She's crying and exhausted. She says I just can't go to work now. It's so stressful. I say something empathetic, but I don't really mean it. She's in my space and I'm tired too. She says I'm worried. I may have cancer. I say me too. I'm worried I have cancer too, with all the things that have been going wrong lately. Then a young woman like Anastasia's ex friend comes in, only she's nice. She starts rearranging my room, putting up a partition and posters and decorations. What's going on I ask. She says we're celebrating the success of a poet. Some man. In my room? I ask. She cheerfully continues. I feel a bit jealous of this successful poet. Maybe he'll like me. I get up, exhausted. I return to find the whole place changed. I open a door and find the poet unpacking. Oh, it's you, I say. He looks vaguely familiar. I go back to my bedroom and see its all a party room. I look in another room to see my bed in a little alcove, with a pretty white cotton crocheted bedspread. I look at the bed. Very pretty, but no room for my wheelchair to pull up to the side.

["Breathing underwater."] I am preparing a staged area for some meeting. I am cleaning off a table and helping students place agendas and information on the tables. Part of the event involves diving underwater to great depths. I have a breathing mask on and I dive in, but can't get to the bottom, because the pressure is too great. I come back up and get some advise that if I switch the toggle switch from the top chest pack to the belly pack when nearing the depths, I will do better. I do that and find I can reach the bottom and breathe fine. I also see some residential people a family who lives down there and they are so acclimated they don't need any breathing apparatus.

She brings me a radio news story of how well I did. Later, I am given the job of organizing the children's paper dragon poster projects. I get some of the kids to bite and make designs on the edges of the papers and gather them all up to organize. I am doing a good job. (117 words)

["Toilet flow direction."] I am lying down at some gate like entrance to the beach and the ocean, waiting for my brother Jake. Lots of people go into the beach area. They are going to look for green round objects that might be food that drifts up on shore. One woman demonstrates her swimming stroke she will use in the ocean. I think to myself I can't swim. But maybe I can walk the beach and find some. As I wait, a "Royal Highness" who is the Minister of Something to the King comes by. They can't figure out when you push down on the flusher handle of a toilet how to regulate the direction of the water flow and which direction is the right one. I call out, "Your Royal Highness" and tell him that you could flush it and observe and then figure it out. I feel a bit embarrassed because this isn't any better information that what they are wondering. (160 words)

["Odd wheelchair."] I am in a public room, lots of people, like a classroom. A man that looks like Michael J. Fox has a very unique wheelchair that he can transform into a blue sled bed and it will recline. He is manipulating it very fast and it doesn't fix up right. I watch with interest. What a neat gadget to have. Then I am holding boxes and boxes of checks from banks, each one belongs to a man in the room. I choose one and now I must find out what man I chose that belongs to the checks. A man apparently owns those checks, I look for him and hand back the other boxes to their owners. I am disappointed to see that the man took his box of checks and left. I guess I will see him later, as he is chosen. (143 words)

I hesitate to show her my writing part, before she does the official critique, because I don't want to prejudice or influence her decisions. But I say you must take a look at the illustrations. They are wonderful. Someone else did them. I fold a page or two over so she can see the colorful illustrations. I tell her that two men are doing this work. They are "howling about God." One is a Jew and another is Catholic. (106 words)

There is a handle on a long mechanical arm like my joystick mechanism laying on the left, not attached. I try and get it to be where it belongs. I see now I have to drive up a steep embankment to get to the road, which is narrow and lots of parked cars along it. It's more like a driveway. I hit the gas and roar up the embankment leaning forward in case we tip over. But we make it just fine. Now I am trying to turn around so we can leave but the brakes aren't working hardly at all. I press hard but we keep rolling. I hit something. A passenger from the back says it's OK. You didn't do much damage. Let's go. I say no, I have to talk with the owner of that object first. The passenger says it's not a problem. They won't care. I say, Even so, I must talk with a grown up about it before I leave. (202 words)

A group of guys come by, one young, good looking and insensitive is making fun of me. I ignore him and am walking to the post office to send a letter. I walk through several rooms and find the post office. I walk up to the counter and can vaguely see a woman. I hand her the letter I am sending and turn to walk away. Then I realize that I was actually seeing the reflection of myself in a mirror and had laid the letter down on the counter. It will never get sent. I pick it back up. The guy is following me, teasing. He's supposed to be doing research on me (my dreams I think) and he's not doing it. I go to another room where the professor (like Milton Kramer) is seated. I say to him, I understand that the original research information of mine isn't as valid anymore. But this guy is missing out on current research he could be doing on me and the others. He has forgotten your theories. (201 words)

Charla and I are walking down a hall. We are looking for a table to sit at. I walk past a man who I don't trust. I choose to go around the corner and find a table away from him. I put my papers and things on the table. The man is at a slightly higher level and looking down at our table. He makes me nervous. I am afraid he will take my things. I guard them closely and warn Charla to guard as well. Then I decide to walk to Grandma Anne's house and stay there. We walk toward it but I change my mind and return to the table. The man grins at me and tries to sit at the table with me. I say to him, sharply, stay away. I don't want you near here. I scoop up my papers and hold them close to me.

["Mask."] I am creating a very elaborate and beautiful mask or head and face dress from pieces of jewelry and cloth. It has lace, necklaces, and so on .

["Traveling with the natives."] I'm traveling down a dirt road in an Asian country. All the peasants are walking and I am riding a very tall plastic blow up animal. It is mechanized so it moves along. I am way up higher than everyone. The animal is a sort of black ostrich looking thing. I come to a bridge over the road, like another highway going perpendicular. I am too high, so I push a button and the hydraulics of the machine shortens the thing enough so I can get under it. The peasants ignore me, they do not like having me there. They do not respect me. Later, the peasants are running toward the fields and I hear an airplane coming. I realize I am in danger and shorten the machine down to the road and then run with the peasants into the weeds in the field. We hide until the airplane passes. We come out. I see shimmery pamphlets lying all over the road. They could explode if we stepped on them. I now get off my machine and pick up clothes and shoes from dead people on the road so that I am now dressed and acting like a peasant. It is my protection. We come into a room. I am more accepted now. (213 words)

I hold the right sides of the diaper together at her waist and the man is trying to get the tape on it. We try several times with no luck. Then I notice we are taping the tape at one end on the diaper and then the other end to the outside of the car door. This won't work, I think, because she will want to get out of the car eventually. Then I see the front of the diaper isn't forward enough to protect, so I pull on the front. I see blood from her period on it but am happy I could successfully get it positioned correctly.

He wonders what it's like to be in a power wheelchair and I get out of mine and choose another chair, which is like a walker with wheels and a chair seat. It is black.

Now we are seated at a dining table, other guests and staff are there. He had placed a package at my place. I open the soft tissue paper wrapping and find a beautiful gold filigree worked necklace with Jade stones on it. Also several rings with jade stones on them.

["Traveling on the different side of the road."] I am getting into a car. I can't decide where the safest place to sit in the back is. I see three wooden chest drawers where the trunk ought to be. I slide one out and decide this could fall out with me in it. So I get in the rumble seat, open convertible seat. No back there. But then there is a back, so I stay there. I am with some other women. I had packed some things. Now the car is a open convertible black limo and I am in the back seat hanging onto the top of a black derby hat the driver is wearing. We are driving down the streets of London England. The buildings are high skyscrapers. There are many shelves filled with wares to buy along the front of the buildings. I am swiveling my head back and forth to try and see everything. I might want something to buy. A street hawker runs with us yelling "water." Over and over. I see a paper in his hand with my name "Barbara" written on it. I smile as it is obvious he got the info off my license plate and is marketing to me. I say I already have enough water. He then changes his call to "California water for sale" and runs to another car. He calls the driver "Mayor" and I think that odd that he'd mistake the driver for the mayor. There is an odd extra strap of material on the top of the hat I can slide my hand into for more secure hold. One object I saw on the shelves was a beautiful rose pink glass bowl. (278 words)

The charlatan man has many of his supporters in the class to try and keep the discussion on proving his theory. I wear a long pastel colored flowing robe. I am in the back of the classroom and see some rolled up papers of his I touch them and they stick to my hand as I hurriedly try to put them back, regretting that I had touched them.

I walk to the front of the room to begin the discussion class. They pepper me with questions that are set up to lead to his conclusions. I am too smart for that and dodge the questions and redirect the discussion to normal physics and science issues I was teaching in the first place. (214 words)

I choose a yellow long skirt and matching top of a kind of silky material. It is tight on me, showing my plumpness. I try on the boots. One, the right side, is very tiny. The yellow insoles come out easily. The left one is very large and the top of the boot is not sewn on. The insoles also come out. I walk downstairs and feel awkward and ugly. (136 words)

We are trying to figure out why we have so few members left. A man, like Bob van de Castle is there. A woman is seated on a couch. A board member, perhaps. She says she thinks the reason is that we've raised the club dues too high so the cost is prohibitive. People dropped out or lost interest. They decide to drop the fee level so people would be encouraged to come back. I ask Charla and her boyfriend to come read some poetry (dreams?) and then I am taking some trip down a hill "back home" to high school times. I also ask a woman poet if I can use one of her earlier poems to do something with. Maybe add a photograph or artistic expression to it. Maybe collaborate with her. She is hesitant. A good looking but aging man (dark Italian) comes up to "me" a beautiful woman in an evening dress and professes his life long love for me from many years past. He hugs me and still adores me.

The dream ego now seems to be a member of the dancing group, trying to think up routines for the group to display. An improv routine to keep the audience interested. (192 words)

I decide it would be wise to keep my rowboat with me in case I need it in an emergency. I try to tie it up so it will trail along behind. I find some nails and hammer them into the floor of the square boat. I then see a glass vial. I must put the end of the rope in the vial and then wrap the rope around it and the nail. I am having trouble getting it to stay firm and safely strong enough. I look down a square open hole and see lots of boxes and things. I guess it is the place where I'll sleep and rest. Like the cabin. I sense someone else, a man is on board. I see a shadow pass when I look up from concentrating on getting the rope properly in the vial. The shadow creeps back behind a box. I finally manage to get the rope tied. I sit on the box and push a button. That will start the automatic process and we will go. I won't even have to steer. (209 words)

I am working somewhere. The boss is cool and I don't enjoy being there. I am now crawling through drifts of snow. It is soft and dry. I touch it with my hands. I am surprised it is warm to the touch. Then the big boss, the owner, comes by. I am back in the office. He doesn't understand why things aren't working out well at work. I say give me $100,000 and I'll tell you. He agrees. I say they don't like the work they have to do. They are unhappy. I say give me $250,000 and I'll tell you more. He agrees. I say that one, my boss, lives on Long Island and the commute is long. He has a family with children and has hardly any time to be with them. I point to another worker. He needs a different kind of work that he understands and can do well. I continue explaining to the owner what he needs to do to make it better for his employees. (171 words)

I need to make a reservation on an airplane to leave immediately. I can't seem to find out where and how to do this. Bonnie is around somewhere. I see a group of people. One man is lying down on his side resting. It's like a MIUSA group. I am to teach a creative writing class. I tell about my stories and how I wrote them. I feel good about how I taught the class. Then as I walk away, a man complains. I return to hear him. He shows me a list of classic books he felt we should have studied. He showed me a handful of pills, big orange capsules and small round ones I didn't recognize and complained he'd gotten those to take during the class instead of two Tums usually given out. Meanwhile, during the class I had a baby to take care of as the people watched. I tried to get him to take a nap. I finally succeeded. (164 words)

["Tidal waves."] A convict is being escorted by a policeman. We are at the beach at the ocean. He tries to escape the car. I am standing on the beach and I see parts of the sand flowing like lava to the ocean. People and cars are being swept out to sea. I scramble to get more inland. I have to cross the sands that are flowing and am nearly swept away into the ocean. I get across, just barely. I and a woman and the convict get into the car and try driving up to dry land. The woman says my little girl, I have to get her. I don't want to, because it is dangerous for her. But I must. She bites her red polished fingernails. We find her and drive up and up. The entire coast is being swallowed up by the ocean. We end up on a mountain. We see a map of the world. A globe. We mention how the sea by Alaska or (unknown) have a very shallow (unknown).

I traveled to a resort hotel, maybe in Mexico with Bonnie and other woman friends. We are there to see a concert by some famous male singer. Bonnie keeps changing her elaborate costumes frequently. There are many stairs. Bonnie goes into a restroom. I step down the 2 stairs into it as Bonnie is saying maybe she can't manage the stairs. I see a line forming in the hall and realize if we don't get in line, we won't get in to see the concert. I say, let's get in line. I walk up flights of stairs wondering why I didn't take the elevator. Enselmo is around somewhere. (108 words)

I am in some radio station sitting on bleacher style seats with other people. A man sits on my left and tries to sit too close to me. I feel uncomfortable. Lots of activities going on, people talking and so on. I need to have a piece of paper signed. I walk up some stairs to a room. I see a desk with drawers and open them. I decide to take and keep some of the things in there. I figure its OK because no one seems to be there that owns them. I go to another room and try to talk with some very busy people to get them to sign my paper. They hardly have a moment to even listen. I finally get one man to sign it. I return to the radio station. I can hear the broadcast. I find my desk and open a drawer, the middle one. Some teen kids are in trouble and I want to help them. I see lots of wedges of red cabbage and forks, knives and spoons. I worry I will not be able to eat all that cabbage and it will spoil. I feel guilty about taking the forks and so on. I decide to take some back to where I got it. I find a plastic sack with cards I had bought. I am upset with myself I had bought them. A waste of money, I do that too often. I am mad at myself. I pack up the utensils to take back, keeping a few for my own use. (262 words)

I live in a house with lots of clothes and things lying untidily on the floor and furniture. I am looking around for Fluffy. I suddenly realize I'd nearly stepped on Bootsie. I hadn't seen her as she was curled up on some clothes. Bonnie visits. I show her I'd been looking at some photos she'd given me in clear plastic frames. One 8 by 10 of an old man I don't know. I wonder where I will hang these. I don't want to hang the one of the man I don't know. I tell Bonnie I'd been looking at the photos. I feel a bit guilty. It's taken me so long. Then Bonnie opens the blinds on a back window. I am surprised as she had a movie poster and some little ornaments. I didn't want her to do that. But I look out the window at the back yard. I am surprised to see that there is a caged area full of chickens and sheep and a llama. These are my neighbors animals but obviously in my backyard. I had thought my backyard ended much before this. Then I look back in the room and see Bootsie curled up. I see her left back foot is very swollen and she is in pain. I am concerned. I feel terrible. I must have stepped on her and caused this injury. I pick her up gently and pet her, checking out the foot more carefully. I see her face is pink from loss of fur. I feel very badly for her and am determined to help her heal. (268 words)

I am in a house. Apparently I rent several rooms to foreign ambassadors. I am very negligent in keeping things clean. I also hardly ever interact with the ambassadors. I regret that now, wishing I'd made more of an effort to get to know them. I must seem very distant and unfriendly to them. I have trouble sorting out piles of paper and parts that have something to do with computers. I try and clean up a machine I hurriedly place a fresh aerosol can of something on a shelf in the new ambassadors room. It is behind something, so it isn't easy for them to notice and find. I wish I'd done that better. (115 words)

["Stay of execution indictment."] I only have 2 hours to live before I am executed. I find it shocking to imagine not existing anymore. I feel fear. I must present myself to the court for my execution. I walk there. A woman lawyer says to me, you can file a stay of execution indictment and they have to hear the appeal. I almost off handedly say Oh, I don't know. I mean the thing is already scheduled and I don't want to upset anything. Then it occurs to me that not dying might be a good thing anyway. Then I feel a bit of remote resentment that my "crime" was merely to be invaded in my home by other people like a burglar. It didn't seem fair. So I finally agree to file the indictment. Then some children with red hair want to go to the movies. The smallest doesn't. I vaguely think going to a movie would be fun, since I'm not going to die. But I tell the child he can go home. I send one of the other kids to walk with him home. Then after they leave I realize that would leave the child alone. So I go and watch him and give up the movie. (206 words)

I am in a building, a bar or performance area. I see two women who are part of an improv group performing. They are good. I walk up some stairs to see them. They suggest we walk across the street to go into a gift/drug store. They start walking with more people up the street. I cross the street, wondering if I misunderstood where we were going. They realize I was right and swing across the street. We go in, and split up to look at different sections. I say I'll go look at the light fixtures and things. I see some Xmas decorations on a turn around rack. Then I'm talking with a man about a plumber. They want me to sign up for their construction company. I become aware they (like the women) are Saturday Market types. I am hesitant to sign with them. I keep asking questions about prices and services. They insist I have to sign up right away. I want more time to consider. I start to walk back to the original place. I see a woman on a bench and I sit by her. She starts talking about her friend and her had raised Jake and Dwight. She did not understand why their mom left them. I get angry and touchy. I say in righteous haughtier, do you mean me? The mother of Jake and Dwight? You don't understand why I had to leave them? She looks at me with disgust. I don't see why you left them to be raised by others. I indignantly show her my hands. I had severe RA. I say. Probably faking it, she sniffed. Then she sees my hands and looks startled. Now she believes me. I get up and stalk off angry. I am back at the music bar. A man comes in to tell me the names of the 2 plumbers who will work my job. Scott D. someone and another man. I recognize them as Saturday Market people. I feel very rushed into this and unsure they will be fair, honest or dependable. (348 words)

["Vampires."] I am talking to someone on the phone. I feel a bite on my arm and see a small circle with an "x" in it on my arm. I realize with foreboding that I have been bitten by a vampire. I tell the woman (possibly Anastasia) this happened. I say I am now a vampire forever. I didn't want this. She insists. I call and find out how to cancel out being a vampire. Now I am standing with a group of people saying to the handsome dark haired vampire man, "but you see, I didn't get a chance to say no to the subscription of the vampire club." He says in a smooth sinister voice that all rules were announced and if I was bitten then I must have accepted the rules. They can't be changed. I say but I never heard the rules. He repeats himself and we go into a verbal loop of repetition. I say, this is like the army. He stands very close, very seductive. I shutter and move my neck away from him. He laughs at me. He finally agrees I will be unvampired. A woman plays the recording of my phone conversation and I have to agree I sounded dumb about vampires, but I don't want to be one. (216 words)

Get under the table I say as it is obvious it will hit us. I worry about the baby girl but think she's safe so far away from the window. The tornado hits and I hear breaking glass. Fortunately the dining table protects us from getting hit by flying glass. After it is over, we get up and walk outside. I am picking small shards of glass out of my hand and arm on my left side. I'd picked them up as I moved through the broken glass on the floor to get up. They hurt but it is not serious damage. (172 words)

I am told to sit in a small space against the wall with the Windows. I am in a wheelchair. No one speaks to me. I hear them talking with each other. In Spanish. I understand Spanish but decide not to let them know because they are talking about me. They are tricking me by not telling me things I need to know, or telling me the wrong things. I go along for awhile. They don't smile and they don't like me. In the dining room, they get their food and leave me to figure it out on my own.

I decide to chance it and lean back so that our heads touch. He is very happy. Now he is holding my hand and we are seated next to each other. His arm and hand are very muscled and strong. It feels reassuring and good. Apparently he's decided we are a couple. I think this might work out, so I go along with it. Then a woman comes in, someone I'd been angry with because of her behavior. She ruined a project I was in once. I see her and decide to forgive her. The man is very pleased and impressed with my good attitude. She and I begin talking of some video projects she has going.

["Hector and me on his graduation day."] I heard that Hector is having his last class in school as today is graduation day. I decide I want to visit him and say hello and congratulations. I drive to the school. It is some small town, like M City. I see a woman I know who I owe money to. I pay her back. Two things done at the same time. That feels good. I enter the school building and pass three or four doors to classrooms. I am not sure which one to enter. I see the office area and ask a man at the desk. He walks me to the classroom and uses an odd reaching device to pull open the door for me. I thank him saying that's a neat device. He apologizes there wasn't a more accessible door for me. I enter a long room about the size of a small gym. The class is seated way in the front. The spectators are in the back. I park my wheelchair in the spectator line. I see the teacher, who is famous for his excellent teaching lecturing. He is talking about Native Americans. Apparently Hector is Native American. A class of elementary school children listen and then leave. Another group comes in. They are seated along the side wall on the bleachers. More spectators come in. I see the teacher is wearing an Elizabethan gown and tights. He is wearing his PHD costume. A pleasant friendly man on my right places his hand gently on my shoulder. I like that. I feel loved. I watch and look for Hector. I finally see him in a grey blue checkered shirt and wearing earphones on his head. He's listening to music as the teacher is lecturing. I smile at him, not sure if he sees me or not. Now I stand up on the side wall area, in front of my wheelchair. Small children are playing at my feet, rolling through me legs and giggling. I smile at them and smile at Hector. The teacher hands some papers to the students and they pass the pick flyer around. He asks them to read the poem on it. Each student reads a line from the poem. It is a nice poem. Something about the moon. Hector gets elbowed by another student and takes his earphones off and reads a line. He smiles at me. It is a pleasant dream. I feel great respect for the teacher and affection for Hector on their graduation day. Apparently the teacher is retiring and this is his last day too. (428 words)

I am in a small life raft in a tiny pool of water. I am lying on the raft and smash up to the wall near them. Then I paddle back because they aren't doing anything yet. I smash up against the other wall and turn and approach them again. This keeps repeating. I say outloud I hope this doesn't change the test results.

I then stand in the center of where the fire burned originally as the flames spread out killing others. I am safe in the black charred remains of the burnt area. Now the authorities are after me. Someone is nice and opens a curtain for me to slip through. I am now backstage. Blocked. I see a tall curtain and see a rip in the end seam. I crawl into the curtain rather than behind it. The authorities come and check that area. I can see their shapes through the curtain. I lean back when they feel the area I am in. They somehow miss me. They leave. Then I escape unharmed.

I pick one up out of the water and find the strands of hair from the back of the head (clay hair) have come off. I am trying to clean up my work area. I get out of the high wheelchair and sit at a regular work chair at the table. It is more comfortable that way. I walk outside holding a cat in my arms.

Paulina, Lance, Charla and I and others are visiting someone's house. We had stayed overnight and it is time to get up early and pack, fix breakfast and leave. I walk out of the bedroom, seeing Charla's feet under some blankets in another room, in a bed. She is snoring. There is a high step from one room to the other that is hard for me to negotiate. I go to the kitchen. Paulina is already there. I am trying to cook some scrambled eggs. I have layers of newspaper over the burners that I had turned on. Now I am digging them off the surface worried I've started a fire. Many layers, never ending. Then I find the red-hot burner and put the small frying pan on it. I stir the mess which is thick eggs. I am also cleaning up as I go. Lance has moved some cabinets with drawers in them across the entrance to the kitchen. I ask him how I am supposed to get out of the room. He then sees my way is blocked and tries to fix it. I put some nuts I'd been eating into what I thought was the garbage can. I realize it is a huge can of peanuts that aren't yet eaten. I try to remember I need to clean my mess up. I go back to the bedroom and see Paulina has already been there packing up my things. I see a pile of magazines which I'd checked out of the library. I realize I've mixed up some of my aunt's magazines with this pile and am having a hard time separating out theirs from the library ones. I wonder why I went to the library and checked them out if we had such a limited time to read as we are leaving soon. Now I notice that there is a terrible hurricane coming up. I call out to everyone to go to the cellar. Charla is asleep. I go to her and finally have to pick her up and carry her as she wouldn't wake up. My grown son who is gay and his fiancee are there, after the winds and rain die down. The fiance's parents are there and have written a check for $273 dollars for their wedding gift. I and my husband (or Lance) are worried our gift isn't nearly as generous even though it is all we can afford. He wants to write a bigger check. I say no, I think we gave $100 or $150. It is fine. Even though I feel guilty. (431 words)

I am watching as a young gentleman and a young man set off on a mysterious journey. There are unknown hazards and witchcraft. They are initiates. The woman doesn't know what to look for. She doesn't understand. The man sees a woman in a golden shape that is like a cage. Then the woman stands in the burning coals and flames. The man goes into it to be with her. He wants to kiss her. She resists and the man backs her gently into a corner and kisses her. They step out of the flames. An older woman or witch tells them to park their bicycle in a particular spot. He wants to park where he can get a better view so he can understand what's going on. The woman is now outside sort of in a trance. A spirit comes by. The man/me looks out the window tentatively. The spirit turns out to be a "grandma." She stands near the door. (162 words)

I am preparing a performance. I write a story or script. I choose to make my own part fairly small so the memorization won't be too much work or pressure. I am now going in to a public bathroom. A boy stands behind me, hiding under my skirts. He and I walk in tandem so no one will know he's there. We wear some kind of weird braces on our feet. As we go into the disabled stall, some woman is outraged and says "The nerve." She's not disabled. Then another woman is suspicious I'm sneaking a man into the bathroom and we might have sex. I laugh. The boy is a brother. A sister is nearby. Now I am preparing to rehearse the script with "my man." He has shoulder length black hair. I want him to nonchalantly enter and go to the band leader's stand and slowly take the music, being a drummer, and making the music go from slow to wild and rhythmic. The band is rehearsing. I say to the drummer (up at the top of the bleachers) try to play wimpy so he has something to build from. He laughs. Him play wimpy?? But he tries, for me. Now I am looking in a mirror with my "man." I want him to comb his hair different. I suggest a side part, like I do with my hair. He can't seem to get it combed that way. I help him.

A plane is loading its passengers. I am the last in line. I wait. The Queen from some foreign country is on board. She is dying. I am upset with her for allowing her people to be uncomfortable just for her convenience. I patiently wait and finally it is time for me to roll on board. I am taken to the very last seat. It's wheelchair accessible. Now I am called to visit the Queen. I go to the front of the plane to the private room the Queen is in. She is veiled. I say shame on you for causing harm to your people for your own selfish reasons. She wearily pulls off her veil. I see two sets of blue eyes. She asks me my name. I tell her. She asks me to print it out for her. I do. My full name. She fills out a paper and names me the new Queen when she dies. She is happy with her choice as I will take good care of her people. Then I see a small baby rolling off a shelf. She seems to be OK. The maid comes in. I had used the commode and she concentrates on cleaning the commode. The Queen chides her for paying attention to the mundane when the momentous occasion of her death and the new Queen is more important. Then the Queen does and I go out to see the Prime Minister who is ready to take over. He is shocked to discover I am officially the new Queen. The Queen and I before she died spent some time talking about the country. Is it poor? Yes. What resources are there? Rocks. Then we'll make the world love rocks. I have good plans to make life better for the people. (300 words)

I come to visit my mother who lies very ill in her house. I go outside to get something from the camper van. I go in there and a small boy is napping in there. Paulina's boy and Paulina is off doing something this morning. He wakes up very glad to see us. We go outside and walk in the thick snow. He runs and laughs and falls on his back. I help him up and a yellow dog rushes up to us playfully and the dog frolics around me. I pet it. Then Valerie comes up. We go to the back of the van. I open it, looking at the piles of books and dream program notes. I go into the van camper with Valerie (sister-in-law). I start to sob about my mother. I reach out my hand and we hold hands sympathetically. She says I'd go visit her but the house smells. I say my mother's so ill and my father never does that well cleaning and Sally doesn't come very often. I think to myself that Valerie could come over and clean it up if it was so bad for her. But I don't say it. Now we walk back to the house the snow is gone. I ask where it went. It melted away so fast. I am near the door and am happily shocked to see my mother up and smiling and laughing. It is wonderful to see her like that. I wonder now she can do that as she is very ill. She darts around manic happy. Then I see her vomit blood into a long slim glass vial with round series of bubbleglass in it. I realize she is still very ill but somehow is managing this energetic happiness. She says we all need to move in with her because then she will be happy. I hesitate and say No. I can't move in. It feels like a no win situation. A trap. (330 words)

["Paulina's bookstore."] Dovre and I are in a room of Paulina's Bookstore. It is a mess and we are trying to help her clean it up. We are picking up books off the floor. Dovre finds two of them she wants to keep. I take them to another room where Paulina is and ask her if Dovre and I can keep these books. I feel guilty because we aren't offering to pay her for them. She nods, but I decide to put them back on the table to be sold. I ask her which table. She says the "B's." I look at one table. She says no. I look at the next table. She says no, then I see they are in alphabetical order and find the "B" table. I straighten up some newspapers laying on the books and find a place for them. They are slim volumes and are almost covered or lost next to the larger books. (157 words)

["Fabulous pool in the motel room."] I and Charla and Ginny are staying at a motel. I wake up in the morning and go to the next room to see if Ginny has left yet. She has not. Another couple of children, including a young girl are with her, so she will be staying for awhile. We decide to have a big breakfast. I order a stack of pancakes. For some reason I don't eat them. It might make me feel bad. Then Rochelle is there in her wheelchair. Her hair is styled very nicely. I remark how nice she always looks. The young girl is trying to talk to her and she doesn't notice she is there. I point her out to Rochelle so she won't accidentally run over her. Then I notice a huge swimming pool in another room. I dive in boots, jeans and all and splash around with the kids. The pool turns into a playing field with lots of water on it. After we are done playing, I go into yet another room and see Rochelle in a purple pretty nightgown, only she must weigh 300 pounds now. She sits in a bathtub, but with no water in it. She asks me to splash some water onto her like we were doing in the play field. She has another favor to ask me but never finishes asking it. I stand there waiting, but she just stops speaking. I then go look out a window and see below a huge bedroom. It is the bedroom of the King. He bed itself is huge. The pillows are bigger than a person and take up half the bed. A train of sorts like on formal dresses is trailing from the bed a long distance. I see bishops and cardinals coming in and watch as they do the ritual putting on of robes and red colorful shawls and things. The King is standing to one side talking with an attendant. I realize I am watching a play. I remember this play from another time. I see people walking under the huge bedside table. They look like little dolls next to the tall legs of the table. I listen to the words and can't decide if this is a play I saw before or another play. I decide it is a different play, but written by the same author. The bride of the King is missing, perhaps run away. I see hangings on the wall that tell me that. It's fun to be peaking at this spectacle from the high window. Then I turn and look back into our room. Charla has decided to go up into an attic through the trap door. She rummages around and the door is shut. I get worried and call to her to come back down. She does so, finally, with a loud bump of the door slamming shut after her. (481 words)

["Varnishing the painting."] I am in a one room apartment. I want to finish up some projects that have been laying around the place for a long time. I see a painting of a man's face. I dip it in varnish, not only the frame, but the entire painting. Then I hold it upside down to let the excess varnish drip off. It feels good to finish a project. I try and sit in the one chair, a modern looking reclining chair. But there are plants draped all around it from hanging plants above it. I pull away some chunks of dead plants to make room for me. I sit there looking at the completely cleared off counters along the wall. I haven't seen it cleared off in years. Now the door flies open. A young girl comes in and three dogs with her. More dogs are in the hall outside. I try to talk her into leaving again, and taking her dogs with her. But she sees my kittens and wants to play with them. I step out into the hall and see lots of people. Ginny and I are going to drive away down the hall in a car, but it is crowded. (202 words)

["Going to Alaska."] I am cleaning up, putting things I want to fix in a pile. A jacket with a torn pocket. Ginny comes in and as I am moving things, she helps. I see she put the things in a suitcase. My large black one. I say no, I need that suitcase to pack for Alaska. So I start to take the things out, fat bottle brushes, empty mason jars, clothes and so on. I go back into my room and into the walk in closet. I choose clothes, asking Ginny should I take this jacket, (the one needing a rip in the pocket fixed). She says no. I say it could get cold there, it is Alaska, after all. She says I won't need the jacket. I choose a few outfits and pack them into the suitcase. Then I find the suitcase I'd used the last time I traveled to Alaska. Some books and papers and projects there I could work on. I pack them too. (165 words)

They look in the mirror and fuss with their appearance. George decides to make a batch of extremely hot chili. He had to practice eating it so he could survive it. His face looks ashen and grey from the extreme heat of the chili. He then takes off a face mask cosmetic thing and looks better. He is smirking because he knows he'll win this contest. Then the other gay man asks if he has any dresses. He says of course. The other man says where are they? George points to a door. The other man says I don't know which way.

I grab her and take the pins out of her mouth before she swallows them. I am distressed. She is dying. She leaps off the bed and races upside down on the ceiling. I am very surprised at this. Then she leaps to the floor and pushes herself violently against a large crib on the left side of the room. She is on her back and I see her anus poke out and a carrot like object come out and back in. I realize she is dying and feel sad. (127 words)

["Dover State University."] I have decided to go back to school to take classes on dreams. I am in the halls. A short man comes by and asks me if I need help. He is a representative of the disabled student unit there. I go with him to his office. His name is Beirdy or something like that. He offers help. Then I go down another hall and find a catalog of classes. It has a small pamphlet with insert pages in it, on brown recycled paper. Very cheaply done. But economical. I realize I've chosen to take a general psychology class and wonder if this will have the right kind of information in it. I begin to doubt my decision to return to school. Jake is around somewhere. I go out to find my van. It is parked on the street. I get into it and see a note from a parking meter person saying they were going to ticket me for illegally parking, but they saw in what bad shape the van is in and took pity on me assuming I couldn't afford to fix the van. I was thankful. (189 words)

["Home with Mom and Dad."] I am at a house I've never seen before in waking life. It is supposedly my parents' house. Long and rambling. I am at the back door which is opened. It has been several days of bad weather and the snow is piled up around the door and on the floor in the hall area at the door so that the bathroom door is blocked with snow. I see the rain and snow has stopped. Charla is outside with some of her friends. I sit down on the snow bank on the floor inside the house and I kick at the melting snow outside. It causes chunks to roll down the steep hill and finally I clear out all the snow this way. A friend of Charla's then goes into the bathroom. Now I stand and use a shovel to clear away stones and silt that is many inches think all over the floor in the room. From the floods. I shovel and shovel. Then I decide I'd better get my parents' permission because I'm just shoveling it out the door, black plastic pieces in it and all. Making a mess out there. I walk over the stony floor to the next room and through that room to another one on the right and down a step. I see a dining room table and my parents are talking with a couple. They look up and say this is private business. I apologize and leave the room to wait. The couple comes out talking about some real estate deal in Vancouver my parents are trying to convince them to buy. I go back in the room. My mother is not there. My father is and Dwight and a Doctor. He has the results of my blood test. He speaks but I can't understand him. I tell him to repeat it because I am deaf in my left ear. He is annoyed and walks over near my right ear. I continue to have trouble hearing him. He says the blood levels are low. I say is that good or bad? He says something about the Orphan Syndrome and low blood levels are a good sign that my Orphan Syndrome isn't too bad. He is referring to how I was raised as a child. I am relieved it is good. But unclear what it is and can't get the right information because he's too annoyed with me. I am frustrated. (407 words)

["Expanding the building."] I go into a building. I need to speak to a man in a particular department. I enter the main lobby. I want to write a note to him. I find many sticky yellow sheets of paper and try to find one which hasn't already been written on, on both sides. I can't find one after searching diligently for a long time. I write down 1 A2 on an already used paper. I try to go up an elevator but it is wobbly and I am worried it will break. I go back out realizing the building is not safe and needs fixing. I get into my van and proceed to drive up the tunnels in the building. The tunnel is white, rounded and narrow and going up. As I drive, I realize I am creating a better situation. The tunnels are now more wide and easy to go through. The building structure itself is stronger and better built. I feel nervous in the narrow tunnel as I drive quickly up to the top. I get out and go back to the lobby. Not many people there. I take the elevator again. The window screen seems wobbly and I stand away from it, nervous it will fall open and I will fall out. Then the elevator stops. I try and push buttons to get it to go up to the 5th floor and then we can go back down to the 4th, which is the floor I want. I works and I get off at the 4th floor. I notice no one is in the waiting room, still thin of company. I feel slightly uppity about that. (277 words)

It is the end of the afternoon and I want to finish the day of work. I ask Rosie O'Donnell a question. She seems to be unconscious. I shake her to wake her. She doesn't wake up. I look at her more closely. There are words appearing on her skin, like she is answering the question or talking in writing. Meanwhile a student like Mateo asks permission to go to the bathroom. I am annoyed because he wears a glove like paint (blue and white) on his hand and he is waving his hand up in the air. I realize later this meant he wasn't coming back. I continue to try and wake Rosie who remains unconscious. I am frustrated. (145 words)

It can't be opened fully, because Jake's body lies in the way. I see he is dead. I go back downstairs to Dwight's bedroom. I see he is dead. I go back to the kitchen and ask Charla to show her wound. She shows me two healed scars where a bullet went through just below her knee from the back to the front. Now I walk into the living room. People are arriving, to ask questions. I tell them they can move back the couch from the desk, which is in the center of the room. They do so and ask me questions. I answer from a stunned sorrow. (225 words)

I am in the back seat of a car. A couple, both with dark hair are my friends. The man is driving and the woman and I are in the backseat. We are near an ocean. I see on the left side of the road the huge prow of a ship coming up on land. 3 or 4 people are trying desperately to avoid being run over. I notice a key ring with 2 keys in my hand. I suddenly remember I hadn't taken my pills the night before or this morning. I have a moment of fear about that. I remind myself to take them when we arrive at our destination. I think its' the day (Thurs.) to eat the oatmeal but it is only Tuesday. We now turn off the coast highway and drive down hill on a small road, past other houses and so on to a house that the couple just bought. The woman watches my face for my expression. She's excited about me liking the house. I am curious and get out of the car. A small boy (theirs) is there. When the mom isn't looking, he sneaks a swig off my coke bottle.

There are a number of them but not enough of the right kind. (coumadin 2.5's) I sigh and feel worried. Then Bill asks a question of a woman student who didn't know the answer. I realize it is a trick question calculated to embarrass her. Revenge. I answer for her and quietly but with firm intent I respond to something he said with "Obviously, it is better not to tell the truth or you will get attacked." (128 words)

I am in some resort hotel room. I decide to take a shower. It is a very wide open shower area, in the large open room. There isn't any furniture in there. A flimsy shower curtain is across the door to the room. A woman, perhaps my sister in law, Corinne, is trying to lock the curtain after she left. She is going to get something. I pick up a notebook which has the events that will happen later that night all written out. I see that I shall see about 5 movies in a row until 2am in the morning. It all feels laid back and relaxed. Another woman and her friend is industriously trying to work with a shape in a closet like area in the hall. I peek in and see a green painted square on the side wall. I come back into the room, still interested in having a shower at some point. (157 words)

I look in the cupboard and find several old hotdogs in bread like a folded sandwich. I ask him if one is his. He says it is. He says I can have it. I decide to throw mine away as it is old and probably would make me sick. I am being sympathetic with my father being alone now. Then my mother comes in and falls. I go to her but she has already gotten up. I am worried because she fell like that already this morning. She says, looking bleary eyed, a bum head. Then she pauses and rethinks. No, she says, a bone hip, meaning a hip joint giving out on her. She stumbles out of the kitchen. She is going somewhere. I am worried, but see that Dwight is following her everywhere. He will take care of her. My father is sad. (193 words)

["Auditioning Ebenezer McScrooge."] I am the director of a play. I am auditioning actors. I see a line of four men who look stoic and stern. I ask them if they are here to only audition for the McScrooge part or if they are interested in other parts as well. One wears cotton fake sideburns. He is only interested in the McScrooge part. I decide to audition these men first so they can leave after that part is worked with. Now the scene changes and I am working in secret with a naval situation. I am standing on a submarine and moving a yellow cloth up and down on a rack, like a towel rack. I am in danger of being discovered as a spy, so I go high up on a shelf of dirt. I hide there. They are looking for me. I am very aware that I am sitting on an edge of the cliff and am slipping. I could fall and kill myself. I cling to the edge hard, worried I will fall. I keep scooting back away from the edge and then slipping back toward it. I feel fear. Then there is an odd sequence where I am experiencing sexual excitement. Lydia is touching Dwight and transferring the feelings into me. I don't know how she is doing this because Dwight isn't there at all. She is sitting on my right on that narrow shelf/ledge, (236 words)

["Asking dream character what he means."] I am in a large building, and I am talking to a woman who says she has her kids in a large garage adjacent to the room we are in. I am concerned and go peek in a crack in the wall to see if it is safe for them. I decide it is OK. I am leaving now. I look to my left and see a tall man. I realize I am dreaming and decide to ask him a question so I say to him, "What do you mean in this dream?" He speaks but his words are unintelligible. I ask him to repeat it. He does and again I can not understand him. Then he says something I think is "Cat Stevens." I am doubting if I heard it correctly. Then he simply disintegrates, starting with his head. So I walk on out. Now I am visiting at a mansion of a very rich man. As I come in a woman comes out and says you're in for it. I say why, is he an alcoholic? She says yes. I walk across a huge room with very high ceilings and carpet and classical pictures on the wall. I am critical of this room. If I had lots of money, I'd decorate it better. Then I notice my shoes clicking on marble flooring. We get to his room which is a wooden desk in a beautiful library, wall to wall books. This is more like it. I like this room. He cynically asks me to make love to him. I chuckle and say no thanks. He is not used to being rebuffed. I leave and go to a quiet place by a river and sit there comfortably with a camp chair and watch the water swirl gently by. He follows me there. He wants to know why I won't make love to him. I am concerned that my place look really good, since I had criticized his so much. There is a sort of muddy spot near where I am sitting. I will it to look better. I now throw bits of bread crumbs to some kind of animal (squirrel or raccoon) nearby. (364 words)

["The huge turd."] I am reminiscing about a time when I was chosen to be the lead MC of some event. And one of the things that happened was in the event, I notice a huge turd on a school desk. This is some speaking event. A man like Ben Affleck is now seated in a school desk and asking me, "So I hear that you did something that got my mom really upset. Tell me about it. I blush and laugh embarrassed to tell about it. He says you remember my mom, right? Italian? I say Oh yeah. Plump, really dark hair. I remember. He describes his father. I say Him I don't remember. So he keeps pressing me to tell the story. I keep hesitating and laughing. He says his father had some affair. I say I don't really remember. So I say OK, so I'd been chosen by Jackie Gleason to be the lead moderator. He whistles how impressed he is and appreciates how important that is. I then tell him how I see the huge turd on the desk. He laughs, appreciating how embarrassing that would be and agrees no wonder his mom was so upset. We laugh. (199 words)

["Multi layered Paulina."] I am in a series of rooms. I am looking through drawers and trying to organize all the things I find. I find an old shirt I wore many years ago and can't see any spots or messes or rips on it. I then see a few, because I am convinced there has to be some. Then as I am about to toss it in the goodwill pile, I see I'd hung many of my necklaces on the same hanger so I keep it all. I find many small cloth pouches that jewelry might have been kept in. I gather them all up in one place. My mother is around there somewhere. Children are around and make noise. It spooks the horses outside. I go to a back window and warn Dwight they might try and stampede. I see small groups of horses in small barbed wire squares and see they can't break out though they whinny and raise up on their hind legs. I am relieved. I continue with my organizing project. Now Jerry and I are in a room and I say you need to relate to me how you fixed two items of mine and I will write it down. He tries to remember. He finally says well, I sort of looked at them and jiggled them and then they worked. I try and write this down on a framed glass sheet. That is the shape of Dwight's stamp B'day gift. I say Oh, so you sort of didn't do anything and they worked just fine. We laughed. Now I am at a dinner table with lots of people. Paulina is there. She is standing in front of me showing off her new work uniform. I say I see what you mean about multi layers. I see 3 or 4 different colored shirts a gold one, a green one and a white one, an off the shoulder peasant blouse. I say they want you to be sexy but keep it hidden. She also has on a large billowy jeans dress that makes her look a hundred pounds larger than she is. (354 words)

I am standing on a lawn in front of a white house shaped like the Mac House, but it is not. A horrible plant is growing out of a small buried mess of body parts in the lawn. It is angry. Its leaves are like tentacles reaching out to try and grab me, to kill me. I had been lazy and irresponsible when I buried the stuff there. I run madly and it grows very fast to try and get me. I run down a street near a parked car. The tentacles could only reach that far and it is screaming (Sounds like Godzilla) with fury and frustration that I am just out of its reach. I stand there listening to its screams and watches as it dies. I walk around the block to stay safely out of its way. Someone insists I go back and look at it now that it is dead. I am fearful to do so, but I do it. I am afraid it will spring to life and kill me. I wake up, afraid. Nightmare. (180 words)

My green van is broken and a man is inside fixing it. I want to explain to him some info so he can do it better. Gaston walks up to tell me, laughing at me gently, not to bother the man. I see a small fluffy dog hop out of the van and get on a small skateboard. He skates under another van (sort of a duplicate of my green van.) It is jacked up and Gaston gets under there to assist the dog out. I am worried he will accidentally knock the van off its jack. It might fall. I ask him to get out of there. It's not safe. He ignores me, laughing at my fear. (118 words)

I am holding a small naked baby, my hand on his little skinny butt. Charla and Ellie and I are trying to get into a restaurant. Ellie goes in. I try but there is a counter. I try to lay the baby on the counter so I can pull myself over the counter. A man is working there, like a matrie de. He says no, you can't put the baby there. That's not safe. I ask him to hold the baby. He refuses. He's afraid the baby will pee or poop on him. I am also concerned about that. I go back outside. Charla is there. Now Ellie comes up to me and begins to clean my butt. I am sitting. I say, embarrassed, did I poop? She says gently yes. She is cleaning up the mess. I am surprised because I didn't feel anything happen. Now I and Ellie are in a building. Some welfare workers are showing us clippings or video of us trying to get assistance illegally. I feel caught. I see a clip of me wearing a blue with white Pokka dots on it blouse and a small peter pan collar. The pants are a bright floral pattern like yellow daisies on a dark background. I am doing gymnastics stands with Charla. She's on her back with her legs up and I am going to lean on her feet so she can raise me. I hesitate. I am so heavy. My tummy is plump and protrudes.

I am in a house with visitors who are there for some meeting. I am the hostess and am walking around trying to keep everyone happy. I see some pieces of pie on plates and pick one up to take it back to the kitchen. It is a colorless sort of lemon meringue pie, and it falls off the plate. I get a Kleenex and try to wipe it up, and I keep seeing more spots of the pie on the floor like I had stepped in it and walked around leaving sticky footprints or blobs where I stepped. Even though I only had one Kleenex and I am worried it won't be enough to take care of the mess, it keeps becoming more Kleenex and I keep wiping up more messes. Some couple comes by and tells me to cancel their subscription to the counselor newsletter. I say OK but wonder why because it hasn't been up and running for months. Now some meeting is going one. Something important is being discussed. [NOTES: I had the TV on and news coverage was going on about the current crisis.] (173 words)

Dovre and I are at a hotel. We are trying to get breakfast. We walk along a line of long tables. Apparently it is full. But then people are quickly leaving. Now we have plenty of places to sit. We get in line to get our food, only now we're buying books. The man at the counter says OK. Pay me. I look to Dovre. I say Where's my purse? I am concerned. Did she lose it? She says I left it in the car. I question her, concerned about this. Are you sure? When did you do it? Now, I am watching a man and a woman who bought some things. The woman bought 3 dresses, a red one, a green one and a black one. She's asking the man if she should wear these green pull on sleeves in the black dress. He is distracted as he's looking at the lovely faceted jewels and stones he bought. A black agate cut like a diamond. He's showing them to a man. There are also pretty copper objects. The woman wants to wear the red or green dress and doesn't think the green sleeves will work with them. (198 words)

["Mom smiles."] I am in a large living room with lots of people. My father is having a celebration about his "geology" stuff. Lydia and I are acting as hostesses. Someone comes by and is handing out special commemorative T-shirts with printing on them. They are a shirt and pants sweat suit. I am surprised the material is so thin. And the shirt is a hooded sweat shirt with a net covered hole in the front center. I am wondering how to wear it without flashing my breasts. I look down at what I'm wearing and see a skirt with a black pair of pants under it. So I carry the sweat suit around with me. I am trying to gather my stuff up and tuck it away on a wall shelf. A small bag (leather pouch). A girl cousin or niece is cheerfully helping. I notice my mother is standing there, quite stiff and lifeless in the middle of the party. I move her over to the shelf too. I speak to her softly and gently. She does not move or respond. Then I see Lydia staring with concentrated concern looking for something. I hop over hassocks and things to get to her. She was looking for some people who crashed the party. I try to help her find them. I mingle and walk through the crowd. I see my father asleep on his tummy in a bed. I go to wake him as he is the guest of honor and should be up greeting people. I call out to him and he finally opens his eyes sleepily. He doesn't get up but the bed is pushed over to a door to a hallway. I walk past him down the hall which is crowded with piles of clothes and things. I see my mother again. She is more relaxed and a soft smile on her face. She doesn't look at anyone or respond but she is trying to dance. I put her in a small box for now. Then I see the box is rattling around on the top of the furniture it is on. I put my hand on the box to calm it down. She's dancing in there. So I feel empathy and say, "I'll get you out of there." I try but I can't get it open. Now I am back in the main room and see a group of my father's geology friends. I walk to them and try and chat with them (dark haired) to be a good hostess. Then I am distracted by a large group of people leaving the party in a steady stream. I follow them to the door and say 'What's going on?" Just going outside for awhile? They don't really respond to me either. Later I learn from Lydia they were passengers of some ferry ride boat and crashed the party. (480 words)

I am jogging quite a long distance down city streets. I am slim, young and healthy. I am tiring my body out and looking forward to the creative writing I will do after this "mind emptying" meditation while I run. I get to the University and turn right. I find my dorm. I jog down a hall. The doors are very ornate, carved wood and pretty. I find my room. I will it to be a single room. I go in to see I need to clean it up. I will the bath room to be in a different place than it is. I get in the shower still partially clothed and lather up the soap. I spend lots of time rubbing soap all over me. I have shampoo lathered in my hair. I rinse the soap off and start to towel my hair. I realize the shampoo is still there. So I rinse my hair as well. I am very tired. (162 words)

["11:22PM."] I am alone in a space ship, traveling. There is a bumping and a small midget sized male alien comes on board. He and I can't speak each other's language. I see his right hand is injured and bruised. I gently treat it for him. We are cautious of each other but we are curious too. I open out a folding cot from the wall and he gets on it. I want him to be taller. He is thin and now long legged. Humanoid in body shape. I want to change course so I don't bump into his round sphere of a ship and cause damage to both ships. He is worried and doesn't trust me. I gently persuade him to trust me. I show him the photo of my mother, my Charla and my father. (136 words)

["Dream group with no dreams."] I am in a living room. Two couches, one on each opposite wall. At the long end of the room, a set of bleacher seating. The dream group is meeting. Each person takes a turn and speaks or sings. As they do that, I am seated on one of the couches and am distracted by my organizational project of my dreams. I see two metal objects that are thin and long like a saw only the teeth are few and large like a large metal comb. These are dream cassettes. I am glad to see only two are left to put into the computer. I've gotten a lot of work done. Then I see writing and graphics on one of them. This is my father's work, his organizational projects, his fossil work and so on. I admire the cartoon animation frames he drew along the top of the thing. Then I become aware that lots is going on in the dream group. More people than usual. Maybe 20 or so, some I haven't seen for years. Lots of talking stories and singing. I am surprised no one is doing dreams. But it feels right that they need to tell these stories right now. Then one man in the right side of the front row of the bleachers is doing the NPR credits. "This is National Public Radio. Etc." I am surprised. Now I see what might be Darryl lying on the ground. I lie down with him and we roll around together. It is friendly. Some other man is watching and is jealous. (263 words)

I am watching as a large fat man, like the actor in "The King of Queens", befriend a small 5th grade girl. They are very happy with each other. However, they crawl in bed together to sleep after they are done playing. She kisses him good night on the cheek. They kiss each other frequently. I feel uncomfortable about this. It feels like it is borderline incest. Inappropriate. They sleep and the next morning, he decides he needs to leave, because this could become sexual and that isn't appropriate. Neither want to leave and they promise to see each other again soon. (102 words)

As I walk around I am lost. I walk down some flattened stairs like a ramp down several flights. I am now outside and notice there are Arab terrorists rounding up people. The Arabs have machine guns and are killing people. I run back into the building and up the stairs. Now I'm in a room, apparently a medical office room. I am captured. They do not kill me but demand I look through the piles of papers and keep any important things like money, checks and credit cards. I mourn the loss of important medical records for people who needed them. I try and save as many as I can. They threaten me but don't harm me. (152 words)

["Desperate need to be perfect."] I watch a man who is a wonderful singer perform. He is delightful. Full voice, perfect pitch. Everyone likes his work. Then he is done singing, only he can't seem to stop. He now insists we listen as he vocalizes the exact sound of each instrument in the orchestra. He does the "a" note like a violin. A "d" note like a cello. He is very good at it. But people are getting restless. Time to move on to something else. He doesn't want them to go. (87 words)

One bin has red and white high heel shoes in it. I am experimenting by kissing everyone around. Except Gaston. He comes into the area (like a caged car spot) and wants to kiss. I feel like I hurt his feelings because I didn't choose to kiss him. We kiss. (73 words)

["Outlaws hiding."] I am part of an outlaw gang. Burt Lancaster is the leader. We are kind of dufus. We are trying to hide until its time to do the heist. We ride horses and go into a crevasse in a rock mountain area. Then we want to signal one of our men. I stick out a big cardboard with a crayon drawing of one of us out there and wiggle it around. A second later, the man on the horse sticks his nose into the crevasse. I must have put the sign right in front of his face. We are worried the sheriff and his men might see. We sneak back to a ranch. A young woman and her mother and father run the ranch. I am now trying to hide some souvenir I bought at a store in a cupboard on their porch. She finds me. I try and hide it. Then there's some contest all the outlaws are trying to win and so I want to try too. Now there is an old hotdog I must bury outside. While there I see a plastic milk jug and try and bury it. Seems the more we try and hide our trail, the more stuff there is to hide! The woman catches on that we are outlaws and seems friendly and helpful. (221 words)

A small boy grabs up some candy like pills. I quickly take them to check and see if they are OK for him to take. Some are not. I tell Esther. I check my pill stash to see if he took some of mine. Aspirin like drugs. I am concerned. (115 words)

I notice other signs that someone is dismantling my apartment. I am moving out, but I seem to be getting lots of unexpected help. I don't know why. It doesn't feel friendly. I hear knocking. I go to the back door and look through a window. I see an Asian man wanting to come in. I open the door for him and let him in. Then I quickly go to the living room and tell people there I did that so he could be watched. Perhaps he will steal something. Then I get suspicious of the older Asian father who owns the place. I sneak a peek in a drawer and find he's been hiding my writings and art work on envelopes (manila envelopes) in there. I am not happy about this. I gather them up to take them with me. I tell a woman about it. Maybe the older Asian father has a secret crush on me. (192 words)

Carl comes in and Jack Nicholson. I am distressed and hardly notice I am naked in their presence. Jack N. is teasing me. He says how come you can't even come over and cuddle on the couch all night like friends? How come? He tells a slightly sexy joke. I say I don't know why you think I can't enjoy a good sexy joke. See, I can and I will come over on Thursday night and hang out with you. I am hesitant and he is impressed I am willing to do this. Then I begin to cry out for my pills. My body pills, I cry. My- and I can't think of the kind of pill I need to take. I can't remember its name. I begin to convulsively take and chew up big pills desperately. I have a mouth full of pills being chewed up.

I get up and stand in the living room at the window. It comes right at us. At the last second I throw myself on the couch and cover my face. The window smashes miraculously no one is hurt. The wind is ferocious. Then I pick up a puppy and carry it into a small nook room. My father brings my mother in. I sit there and tell her about the funnel cloud and how I dreamt about it. She smiles and talks to me. I am so happy and surprised. I show her the puppy. She says she wondered where I was last night. She had thought "Barb will know where I put my things when I unpack." I say Oh I wish you had awakened me. Then she requests I make some cranberry juice. I do so in a pretty glass tall pitcher. My father is so happy to have her back and so well. She is sitting in a robe in a manual wheelchair. My father pushes her out into the kitchen table. I open a small refridge to put the juice in and see 2 other pitchers with just a small amount in them of cranberry juice. I say OK everybody, drink the leftover juice first.

Now the scene changes and I am walking through a street scene where lots of tourist shops are. A sort of mall of one specialty shop after another. I am looking for a special type of popcorn oil to make yummy popcorn. I am told by a black man where to go to find it. He seems to be linked to doing dreamwork as well. So He won't come with me so I start looking around for a ramp to get to the next level of shops. I need to go around and down and try to get to the outside street. I have trouble finding my way, asking directions as I go. I finally get out on the street. Lots of colorful shops but not the one I want. Then I see I've come around full circle and see the shop, but it is practically right where I had started. If I'd simply backtracked a few steps and turned in a different direction, I'd have had a quick trip to it. I am surprised and annoyed that I was given wrong directions, apparently deliberately.

I notice we are so far back into the cave that any audience across the river couldn't see us or hear us very well. So I move and Lucy comes with me to the open mouth of the cave. I try to read my script pages but can't find my place. So I just start improving lines, from the heart. Now we are back across the river and I see some people up on the outdoor stage preparing to give some awards. I am prepared to go get one. I am called and go up on stage.

["Disability and creative writing."] I am at a meeting of disability rights people. I am seated in my wheelchair near the front. I notice a great many more people than usual are attending. A boy sits in my chair with me. I am startled but try and accommodate him. He sits on my left. The chair seems to look like a large leather upholstered chair in a library but on wheels. The crowd swirls around me and I politely move back a bit as it surges around me to get to the front. Lucy and her family walk past me moving out of the room. She says she'll be back soon, but there are things she needs to do for the family right now. I am a bit annoyed, but let it go. Now the crowd quiets down and I see I am at the back in the back row. I realize I usually would be up front, but it seems fine that I just be an observer right now. Now I am holding a long index card box with many cards in it. I am showing someone a fat group in the middle that represent my creative writings. It's a lot. I feel pleased with the amount. I pull out a large manila envelope and pull out a laminated cute colorful picture of a dinosaur. I chuckle at it. I then tell the person that this isn't actually my writings. Someone else did this. I find a couple more cards with projects that aren't mine. I feel a bit nervous that my large group of cards is getting smaller. I can't seem to find one of my own projects in this group. (279 words)

I am lecturing on the new computer program I spent years creating where now I have 3-D virtual reality companions I've created. I display one that was created to protect me. He's a burley big guy. I tell them of the long hard struggle of lonely years of work to complete this task. Then this audience which is full of employees of a large company are dismissed and we all go to a smaller classroom. I am writing things on the blackboard. My name and the name of the thing I created using physics. Another of my creations, a young immature shy teen girl, is on stage and I talk with her. A man is in the audience.

["Haunted house."] I moved to a house and am trying to unpack. There are many rooms. I am upstairs. I go across the hall and into another room. It feels very scary. Some entity is in there. I go back out and down stairs. I try and calm down. I see the front door is blown open a few inches by a heavy wind and dry dead leaves are fluttering into the house. That makes me feel scared too. I shut the door and then see some round scatter rugs piled on a surface. I gather them up to clean up the place. Anastasia comes in. She is going to help me. She picks up some things and takes them upstairs. I find a few more rooms. Anastasia is gone for too long and I get worried. I go upstairs even though I am afraid. I can't find her. I pick up some more things laying around that makes the room appear messy. Now I am having trouble seeing. Like I can't keep or get my eyes open. I struggle. Then I can see and go to the scary room. I step in. It is bare. But I can feel the presence of the spirit. It feels threatening. I can't find Anastasia. Again, I can't get my eyes open and I feel panic. I struggle and manage to open them enough to get out of the room. Then I become aware of hearing the TV and realize I am hearing the Martha Stewart show with a Halloween theme. I know I am in that stage between waking and sleeping. I watch a few images shift and change. Then I wake up, still feeling uneasy and scared. (284 words)

["Everyone dies in the old folks home."] I am on a bark mulch path that is sort of a nursing home place. There are two elder women and two elder men that live there. I either live there or am visiting. I know them well. One woman knows she is dying today and another will be dying soon. I am around the one dying woman. She dies, then I am concerned about the second old woman. Meanwhile one of the elder men whom I affectionately call Mr. Piggy says he is near death. I say this sure is the day for it. He goes to lie down in his room which seems to be on the path, which is hilly going gently up and down. I suggest to someone we move his coffin right into his room so when he dies it will be close by. I watch as they move it in. Then I wonder if that is bad taste. Maybe he will think I am trying to hurry him along. He doesn't seem to mind. Then I go in and he requests one of my chocolate candies. I give it to him. He sighs happily. The other old man is a sort of ancient Gaston. He is thinking he will die soon. We walk along together on the hilly path. We talk about Mr. Piggy. (220 words)

["The spy sandwich."] War is going on and I have in the basement of my home a secret sandwich which somehow is important to the war effort. Actually the sandwich is a sort of camouflage of whatever I am creating. I have a young female roommate. I am in the basement working on the secret project wondering if I should let the military know about it. Can't be the air force because they are the enemy, but maybe the Navy. I am trying to change channels on a weird TV and having trouble seeing what is on each channel. I then look out the window and notice the shallow end of the ocean is practically up against the house. No extra safety space if there is a storm. I see the area really close to the house is sort of a tide pool area. A friend of my roommate is coming to see my project and I try and hide the sandwich. Then Dwight and even Jake comes in. Apparently I've called a family meeting. (172 words)

["Having fun dancing."] I am in a room. A meeting of some kind with Archie. We are talking about dancing and dancability. I go to another room, where some people are doing contact improv. I am enjoying watching them. I join in. The height of my wheelchair keeps going from flat on the floor to knee high, as I use a lever to try and get it to a comfortable level. I dance as I do this. The younger people are impressed I can do so well. I tell them I used to do this a lot. Then Lucy and Mirabelle and others come in. We hug and talk. Then Cindy of MIUSA comes by and asks me to dance for 20 minutes so she can document I did it. I say sorry. I have to return to this meeting. Wish I could. I go back to the meeting where "Archie" is a black man. He meeting seems to be over. We hug. I want to find Cindy and get that documentation done now, but now she's gone too. I feel disappointed.

["Starting over again with my dream program."] I am in a room. I have a desk cluttered with strange objects. A woman comes in. She is there to assist me to work better with my job, which is to get my dream program up and being useful at this company. I've been working on it for a long time. Apparently, I haven't been working on it much lately. I feel the need to begin again. But I am confused what these objects are. Some are organized, some are just laying around. I try and explain to the woman. Someone hands me a broken video cassette. I see it was smashed, maybe run over like by a wheelchair. Maybe mine. The round rolls of tape are out of the cassette. It can't be fixed. I sigh in frustration. I return to my computer area. I realize I will have to start over again to recall what I was doing with my dream program. Now I'm in another room. Some babies are lying on a couch. Tiny newborns. I see one black baby all naked. His color is a sort of grey blue shade of black. It doesn't look healthy. I realize it is very cold and can get sick. These babies are sort of like toys for Charla to play with. I pick up an outfit to clothe the baby with. It is damp. That will only make things worse. So I pick up another outfit. I can't get it on the baby. Someone else finishes the task. Now I am seated and Charla is talking with me. Visitors come to the door. A boy with bleached blonde hair, all cool, comes to ask Charla out. She laughs in embarrassment because she had chocolate or dirt smudged on her many double chins. I then see she looks like Ellie. And Ellie has the same mud or stuff on her face and neck. Apparently they were playing make up or something. Then I see the boy has it too. I offer a couple of different colors of lipstick for Charla to try. Then she and about four teens go out the door. One young female teen has a huge bouffant bee hive hair do. Then all of them are wearing scarves like Muslim women as they walk out the door. (381 words)

["Let me do PE."] I have moved. I am in a new job, a new town. Charles Gibson, ABC news man, is helping me locate a special place to live in. He gives me a paper with an address. They won't be available for awhile, and I am thinking of getting another place temporary and waiting for this wonderful place. Then I am going to school. I am in a locker room waiting to talk with the gym teacher. Class is starting. I see a gym by looking through a large plate glass window to the gym below. Women are playing sports games and exercising and so on. Apparently a committee must meet and decide if I can take the PE class. I am anxious to meet them. Finally the male teacher comes out and introduces himself. He asks me why I'm there. I say because I am afraid that the committee will decide I can't do the PE class because of my disability. He says do you want to do the class? I say yes, very much. He seems friendly and willing. (179 words)

["Whirlwind knocking at my door."] I am in a house and become aware that a large wind storm is approaching. I open the door and look out. A whirlwind is approaching. I shut the door quickly. I walk back across the room away from the door. I stand in the other doorway across from it that goes to another room. The whirlwind slams against the door like it is knocking. I realize with a small bit of concern that I am in the path of the whirlwind and could be hurt if it does break in. I think of moving out of the way, but I don't because I think it won't make it in.

I run up the stairs which has piles of sand on it. The sheep are coming up the stairs at me and the boy. I shove and kick the sand in their faces, trying to slow them down. It works. They turn and go back down the stairs. I was on the verge of rounding a corner to the second flight of stairs but don't have to now. (103 words)

I need to help get her things packed. Then I am seated at a cafeteria table with some teachers. Then Howard is there across from me. I wonder why it's been so long since we've been in relationship, or had sex. I wonder if it will work if we try again. Then my mother is there. The image is like she's lying down but there's no furniture she's on. She gives me an odd cuddly sort of kiss on the cheek. I am glad to see her. She tells me we only have a few more days to get Charla packed and moved. I tell her I've already started on the packing at her house, Charla's room. I'll get on doing the rest now. (150 words)

I am in a woman's house and yet I am also on stage. I am describing to the audience which is not in front of me but off to the right side, that my work with my dream program created yet another wonderful new experience. I have discovered that there are patterns that create beautiful music. I see in front of me a schematic drawing hovering mid air. I see algebraic type formula's with X's and Z's and minus signs all in a 3-d chess kind of setting. When these patterns are played beautiful music happens. I am passionate about it. A man in the audience is worried. He says but how are you going to do all this? You need help. I say I know and I feel sad. I do need help. I don't know if I can get it. Then I am getting ready to go to school. I feel tired and not prepared. (157 words)

A friend of mine like Alan Arkin comes and I laugh because he looks like a Native American Eagle Mask and I try and see him under it. He is friendly and concerned for me. I try and explain what I see instead of him. The yellow neck ruff feathers, the white feathers around his brown round golden eyes. Then an old man who is rich and owns the house is seated up on a wall, like in a high chair. Someone views the room and says Oh, there is no furniture here. She can't be living here. I say I have one chair and the couch. Then the message I didn't understand is repeating. Sentences I try to trace with my fingers. Need the pain, something about the pain. I need to figure out what this all means for my own well being. My friend is sympathetic and wants to help. (188 words)

Suddenly the entire brick wall starts falling in on me. I sit there thinking Oh my God, I'm going to die. But somehow it crashes down and nearly hits me but I am safe. I am very surprised. Mitch R. from High School sits with me. He is loving and helpful. We cuddle. I am concerned about the special glass fragile goblets of my Grandmother's. I am worried it was smashed during the fall.

I name all my previous babies, Dovre Jo, no, Jo, Ellie, Paulina, Charla, Amelia, and Damian. I think of the name Christina for the baby. But I definitely don't like that name and say no. I can't come up with a name. I hold my hand under it's tiny butt and see some pee came through. I dump that and get a fresh diaper. (103 words)

["Howard trapped again."] I am hiding in a bed that is like a top bunk. A blanket is used like a curtain. Howard comes into the room. He knows I'm there and comes up in the bed with me. I pretend to be in a coma. He leans up to my face, his cheek on mine. He says I know you are there. You had better reconsider our relationship. I'm not going to stay here forever with you ignoring me like this. I think to myself. It's better off for you if you leave. He is angry. I am determined. Then he leaves the room and I get out of bed. Lydia has a friend that wants to sell me a big storage system for my dream program stuff. I ask how much. She says 1600. I laugh. I haven't got that, but she comes in to do the pitch anyway. I ask her what kind of media she is using. She is impressed I have a video player in my room. It's sort of an office. I say but no monitor to see it with. I use it on my computer, which is in a small separate room off this office. Somewhere in there I help a female client with her problems. (210 words)

["No help to be had."] I am bussing home from California. I have some physical problem and end up on a military ambulance. They are brusque and non helpful. They give me some pills. I see some broken Vicadan pills and attempt to swallow them with applesauce. One gets stuck and I have a hard time swallowing it. Finally I am successful. Now they want me to swallow other pills. I ask what they are. They refuse to tell me. Then they threaten to force them down me if I do not comply. I tell them of my throat condition and how they could kill me if they did that. They are militarily insistent. I decide to leave. I have to walk as they won't assist me and the ambulance in non accessible. I walk slowly with difficulty and struggle down the 2 steps of the vehicle painfully. Then they dump my power wheelchair onto the ground and take off. I am left on a hillside by the side of the road. I see a bus stop and go there. I am trying to figure out where I am. There are shelves with booklets and information on them. I figure out I'm at a college but can't get the name of it. Y College is on one booklet. Finally I see some students. I tell one I am trying to get home and can't figure out where I am. I am stranded. They are concerned and many of them gather around me to hear my story. One woman student suggests I write my adventures down as stories. I say I always do that. I ask for help. They suggest there is a woman who helps out emergency situations. I ask them to contact her. They say no, as it is 11pm and they don't want to disturb her. I am frustrated. All I want to do is go home and I need help to do that. Where will I sleep, how do I get an accessible bus. Which is the right one. Where am I? They say I am at P College. (347 words)

I go outside to look. I walk on a path along the river. The water is still and shallow. I say the water is low as it is California. Hope there will be enough water to put out the fire. I walk on and look into the forest. Someone had gone in there and reports that the fire is coming but it is a long way away. I am concerned and want to prepare to be safe. (118 words)

["I don't listen."] I am in a church. I am a part of a group that are all dressed up in formal wear. We are lined up to walk up to the pulpit and be formally accepted. I am the first one of the group, so the Minister begins to talk to me. He signs my name Barb Sanders on the paper but he totally ignores the others. I feel embarrassed. They are upset. The Minister gets all tongue tied and says half finished sentences and says wrong words that don't make sense. He feels embarrassed because it is awkward, not smooth.. Finally he's done talking and we go sit in the pews. It all feels unfinished. Now I sit next to a man in a lovely cream colored suit. He seems to like me and me him. He's trying to become acquainted. A woman stands up in front to talk. Her mother is embarrassed. The woman has a thick roll of paper with her. Life sized. Then as she lectures, she stands on the chalk tray of the blackboard just behind the Minister's pulpit which faces perpendicular to the audience. She puts the unrolled paper taped to the blackboard. Then she stands against it like she is a living part of it. She swings out toward he audience like turning the page. As she swings back and forth, she is erasing the blackboard itself to where it is see through glass. A couple of men with video cameras go into the room off the church area and film us through the clear glass. As she stands and moves on the chalk tray, it bulges and buckles. She gets down and walks near me. She's going to return up there and I warn her of what I saw. She doesn't heed my warning. Now I'm at home and seated on the couch. The phone rings. It's a dreamer for the Nightmare Hotline. She talks and then I interrupt her and hang up, expecting her to understand she is supposed to call again. She does. And I interrupt her again and hang up. I feel badly. I am doing this wrong. I should explain the procedure to her and listen to her. The phone rings again. He said his name but I didn't hear it. I recognize his voice. He wants us to have a date. He is intense and somehow sad and negative, already worried I won't like him. He wants to go to a swimming spa and sit in the hot water and be close and intimate as we talk. I ask him to give me directions to the spa. He sighs sadly. He can't figure out how to explain the directions. By now I have the feeling he's a "stray kitten." I am losing interest, just as he was afraid I would. (471 words)

["Beautiful interior of house."] I am at a house, maybe Grandma Maude's house. I had stayed overnight. Some family occasion. It's time to pack and return home. I am gathering clothes up from under a bed. I think many of them don't belong to me, maybe they are my sister's. Now I am standing outside of a house, apparently it is my house I am returning to. I stand under a tree looking at the house. I am curious what it looks like to other people. I see a flat front with chipped paint a baize color. I see the side where it is very long and apparently five stories high. I am surprised there are several more floors than I remembered. I wonder if someone else lives in that part. Then I remember it is all mine. Now I am curious and want to see the other floors to see what I have. I look in the front windows and see wonderfully beautiful glassware and cut crystal bowls sparkling in the sunlight. There are many beautiful art objects in this house. I really like that. I notice the difference between the unkempt appearance of the outside of the house and thew inner beauty within the house. I then see several children getting out a side window onto a ledge that goes around the house. The babysitters are letting the children out for while. This seems dangerous to me. I step back under the tree so no one sees me. I see them hand the baby to one of the girls. Charla is one of them. The walk along the edge of the ledge, apparently safe. But I am nervous for them. Now I go into the house and walk through rooms. I find a kitchen and see a bathroom utility room to the side on the right. I go in and am amazed a how Sharon had cleaned and fixed it up. Yellow and Black patterned linoleum on the floor. It is spacious. The toilet however is constantly running nearly overflowing. The bowl is full of water. I see it needs to be fixed and a raised seat made for it. I think this will be easy to do. I see another room off this one and go in. A pretty bedroom, a wooden bed diagonally across the room. Several flowered patterns of wall paper. Pretty curtains on the several windows. I call to Charla and say isn't your room on the second floor? She says yes. I say how about this one? She looks it over and agrees it will be a nice bedroom. We decide she will move into it. I want to explore the floors above and see what rooms I have there. I am enjoying the discoveries. (458 words)

Paulina and Caroline are there. We are talking. Now I want to move to another room. I go down a hall. My father and Uncle Willis are walking ahead of me. As they enter a bedroom, my father quickly pulls his pants down. I figured he was changing clothes, so I turn into a bathroom to take a pee. People keep wandering in and out, mostly relatives.

I quickly pull some Serene wrap onto the bottom of the basket so the pee won't go through. I pee a lot. Then I try and clean up my mess, carrying the basket trying not to spill any.

Now I am home and in bed, the woman client is in bed with me. She has an injured disabled foot. I am still counseling her. Howard comes in. I explain to him this is my client. He nods at her foot.

["Out of body experience."] I am in bed asleep. I get up and walk into a living room. This place is old and funky like many of my dream places. I see a typewriter with a carbon paper on it sitting on the old couch. There are lots of odd looking machines and machine parts. Dwight has been inventing things again. I go to a black computer monitor and turn it on. I see lots of writing on the screen. I realize I've gone on line and a prepaid telephone card is adding up the charges. I can't remember how to use the computer so I shut it down using Alt and delete keys. Then Dwight's odd machines begin to expand. One is a metal silver cylinder a few feet across and it is growing toward the ceiling. I am concerned it will push through and cause damage. It in fact pushes against the ceiling and bulges it. I hear a loud snap of a 2 x 4 snapping. This doesn't seem safe, so I leave the room and return to my bedroom. I have trouble remembering where it is. I open a door and see myself sleeping in a hospital bed, like my own. I approach myself. I don't look well. I then enter my body and see the blinds on the window and realize my consciousness had transferred back into myself. (229 words)

["Dream workshop."] I am attending a dream workshop. It lasts for days. I sleep in someone's car. The workshop is crowded and I have barely enough room for my wheelchair in the group. I need to go pee and enter a bathroom. It is crowded. I look for accessible toilets. None. Then I see one but an able bodied woman is using it. She points a device and says that's for the disabled. Use that. I look at it. It looks like a weight scale for babies. I say I don't know how to use it. I wait for her to finish. She leaves saying it's broken. I look and see slugs in an old fashioned metal bedpan. I explain to another woman that I can't use the lower toilets because of the damage in my knees. I leave. It is the end of the workshop. I pack. I have several wonderful books on dreams that I bought. I go to the car and the family that owns it are annoyed that I used it. I apologize and take my mess out of there. They drive off. I decide to stay the afternoon enjoying the dream crowd and talk. Then I realize I have no place to sleep. A man allows me to share his single cot. We have to hide me under him. It is cozy and safe. No one finds me. (231 words)

He is having a heart attack. I am trying to get a signature from someone to take over the business. A man is escaping in a car. As he drives down the narrow steep mountain road a white substance appears on the road whenever he uses his brakes. He tries not to use his brakes so he won't be detected, but the road is dangerous, so he must, on the curves. Now my father is getting married and I am the bridesmaid. I wear a pretty long dress.

The clerk insists that the dress is the right size. It is an 18. I say no, I wear a 16 or even a 14. I put it on and show her how loose it is with plenty of room to spare. I take it off. Now I look through the racks and can't find any other dresses to try on. I am also looking for things for Charla. Then Dwight and Jake are there. I say something to Jake who is being non cooperative. A man sitting near him asks him why he isn't being helpful to me. Jake says grumpily if you want to be my friend, don't tell me what to do. I have to return a phone device I bought. I assure Dwight that I will pay for it if I have to so he won't get stuck with the bill, since he put it on his visa card for me. (191 words)

["Where's Dad and sleeping mice."] I return from M City with Charla. I am moving my computer furniture into a bedroom. Placing it so I can see out the window comfortably. I see a pile of plastic stack boxes and look in one that has jelly belly candies in it. I see two fat little mice and think they are dead. I see one stretch so I know they are sleeping. I need to find my father. I walk out of the bedroom up one stairs to another part of this house. I enter a kitchen. Some other family lives there now. The woman has to move the stove for me to get through. Narrow passageway. I go down a hall to the living room. Lots of young adults with babies are sitting or lying on couches and opened couch beds. My father isn't there. I realize he didn't return from M City with us. I ask the people if my mail arrived. They said yes but they can't find where they put it. I am frustrated. I walk back to my bedroom only the passageway from the kitchen is now partially blocked off with a piece of plywood. I squeeze through just barely. Then I see boxes of Jello in plastic containers. One a giant sized box. I decide to buy them. I turn back and ask Jerry E. the store clerk to ring them up. Now I am walking with them and realize they are very heavy. And I wonder what flavors they are. I should have looked first. I chide myself for not thinking of that before I bought them. I am angry at myself for scooping up a bargain before thinking it through and thereby wasting my money. I always do that. Annoyed. (292 words)

For the second night in a row, I dreamed of Jon. He was trying to make an impression on me. He embarrassed me! Then I dreamed that Reta and I saw Blake in a restaurant and we went in and had a coke. Some kids were dancing and I was wishing Blake would ask me. He did. We bopped all over. When it was done, we sat down. He said, "Your hair's messed up." I said, "Oh, dear, not again" (He had his arm around me). He bent to me and said, "Yes-let's mess up a mustache" and then he kissed me. The kiss was so real! Then I dreamed that Nate came home. I met him in S City at the bus depot. He was 6 feet tall and all muscles. He grabbed my hands and then threw his arms around me and kissed me,(All these dreams were when I was fast asleep).

Again, I am in a richly decorated room, a large bed. I am eating very sweet rolls, butterscotch on sweet rolls. I am suspicious of it. A man has been "sent" by another man to make love to me. I am vaguely aware of all this and I'm suspicious. A thought occurs that, "Now it is OK. The sweets are fresh and not poisoned or drugged." The man leaves and the "original" man comes to me. A feeling of being pursued, not frightening. [BL] (83 words)

As I was "waking up" from a nap, Ginny and Rosemary were perched on my bed. Ginny was doing Math. I watched her count columns, carry and write numbers as she figured and I said, "You do math like me." She wasn't doing well. Then I got worried. I said, "Oh Lord, I'm sure that I'm signed up for an intro to German class, but I forgot to go to any classes and it's late in the term. I'll flunk." I started looking through my filing cabinet for the register form. I saw some B'day cards scrunched in there. Rosemary said, "Take those out." I had to see a boy standing on his head trying to say something but no one would listen. It was a B'day card to the devil. He had a grotesque red face, with huge reddish teeth. He was standing very large in a formal striped suit with a tie and carnation and a huge overcoat on. His coarse, snaky tail was draped around him. No fear. [BL] (171 words)

I had the most incredible dream. I was back in the hospital only it was a sort of school. I'd just been informed that I was going to be executed at 9:00 the next morning because I'd not gone to a meeting. I was paralyzed with fear and the enormity of the injustice. My 2 roommates, also condemned, went home for the night to be with friends and family. I didn't have anyone special to go to, so I stayed. Someone (perhaps my alter ego), came to me and said, "Come on, let's fight this. We'll go talk to them. They won't do it." We flew, over a muddy, cold, choppy lake. A lady in a helicopter was who we were to speak to. My friend advised me to speak confusingly, not good to be clear and direct. It didn't work. I was back in my room. The chaplain came in. He brought me a "form 52, a form of protest" to fill out. If I filled it out, they'd have to stop the execution and deliberate. He said, "Sometimes it takes them 'til summer!" [BL] (185 words)

I had another strange dream, about kittens. The 3rd one. This one, I gave birth to 1 dozen kittens for their mother. I called her over. She moved them to a drawer nest, one bright orange one, one yellow one. I said they would be mine. The rest would be given away. They were cute, fuzzy, and playful. There was a puppy in this dream too. Strange. What does this symbolize to me? [BL] (73 words)

Back at a place like uni house. The kids and I are going to see the movie "Tell Me that you Love me Junie Moon." We get to the concert hall. I see some friends (blonde woman), and the kids go to sit by them. I look in a side room. A circle of people sitting in chair (regular ones) forming. I chat for a moment and then go to join my kids. I see an empty space behind friends. I must "tightrope" walk a bench (blonde wood). As I almost get there, my "friends" get up and leave like strangers (I had overslept and was late to movie). Now I'm at a house. It's late at night and dark. Fletcher walks in. I say, "Hi." We talk. I say, "So, on your way back to Hawaii?" (He wore a Hawaiian shirt). He is surprised that I know so much about him. Generally he's cool and distant but when I read him right, he really looks at me. He starts to make love to me. He doesn't really care about me or how I feel. He has an orgasm. Then I feel an orgasm coming. He sucks my breasts. They are flabby and old. I am at first embarrassed. Then I don't care. I get in a dominant position and go for an orgasm. I kiss his ear. He is non-responsive. He's like Raul, but skinny like Elliot. [BL] (238 words)

A wedding. The guests were dressed up like for Halloween, Witches, etc. The bride came and stood at the alter. A male in drag, crying (fake), and exaggerating a coquettish female, came down the aisle (raked steps like the theater at the community college). He was the "groom." Then after he got to the aisle, he took off his mask and was an usher. The real groom (male), came down the steps. The female minister in costume was replaced by a male, "real" minister.

Paul McCartney and my "friends" were on one side of a room, and the Arabs were on the other. A chain link fence was between us but there were gaps in it. Paul started yelling insults and taunts at the Arabs. I said, "Stop it." I stood up and walked to him. The Arabs started yelling back and coming into "our" side of the room to fight. I was in the middle; I made them go back. Paul and the others started up again. I again tried to stop them. One Arab thanked me. Then, they all started again and I gave up. It was too big. I gathered up some things and left the room. Now I was in the hall. I said, "I want to get away, where there's no people." Paul said, "You want to go camping?" I'm not enthused. I want a fireplace, etc. My father said, "You can go somewhere remote, if you can handle traveling over the Texas desert." I ask if we can go where there are no hunters. I don't want to get shot.

A dinosaur. I am on its back. A large beautiful snake, green and shiny, with gold threads, is its driver. I must hold on to her head just behind the jaw to keep from getting bit and to control where to go. She tries to bite me. I have to be very strong to keep her under control. I am struggling hard and I almost can't do it. She turns to look at me and says, "'Little girls' shouldn't (or couldn't) do this." [BL] (83 words)

Later, I'm being chased by people in 4 helicopters. They are trying to shoot me. I get on top of a green airplane just barely larger than my body. I lay down on it so it and I are the same configuration. I control the speed with my hands on the prop. We fly over a big shiny lake. I look back. Two men run and jump into the lake to escape the helicopter. They land head first in shallow water from the waist to the feet. They are out of the water (standing on their heads) I go over a mountain, calling ahead to get permission of the airport to land quickly. At first they refuse. I have to wait my turn, heavy traffic. I tell them this is an emergency. They say, "O.K., you'll have 10 seconds between planes." I then get inside the plane. I think, "No, I don't want to, I feel trapped," but then I decide to because I would have metal around me and the chair back to stop bullets. I land. Then I'm in a huge house sort of like M City, only there are lots of windows everywhere (like at in-service old club house). I tell people, "Duck down, or you'll get shot." A mixture of people are there. Chuck, Dylan and lots of young college age women. One young woman wants to know what's going to happen to our deal over the yarn if some of us get shot. I am impatient with her. I say, "If I get shot, the yarn's yours, O.K.? The rest we'll worry about later." I go downstairs. Two Seans come in, nonchalantly. [BL] (277 words)

I was aware of two good, heavy dreams. I even had the images still in my head but I was unable to verbalize what I dreamed. No sequence or objects to put names to.

A secret door. I started to go through the back door. 2 men were blocking the way. I shut the door and went through a side secret door. It led to an old abandoned room. Somehow I had made a time change. I was back in pre-historic times, in a cave. I stood near the mouth of the cave and an eerie light (green phosphorous) shone on me. I cast my image out into the night to look scary. It scared the natives. I saw some children swimming from school, raging water. This was ordinary for them. 1 girl had to walk on land the long way around. The clansmen talked about raising the bridge the children walked on so it was above the water in storms so they wouldn't have to swim so dangerously. I met a man, a caveman. I was intelligent and seemed to know things (realized memories from modern times would unconsciously filter through and I would solve problems). Others felt nervous about me, because I was so good at figuring things out. A plane landed on the swimming place. A man got out, and pushed the light craft up to shore so it wouldn't float away.

A vocational rehab counselor was questioning me about my cousin Sonja and her capabilities as a VR counselor in the coast office. I told him that Sonja and I go back as far as birth. She had a few things to learn yet, but she was pretty good. He said he wanted to know more. We got into a car and drove to the M City house. There was some snow on the ground. I suggested that he park in the driveway. I say, "Turn right into the driveway." He obstinately turned left into a bank of dirt and snow. He and I agree that that won't do. He turned the car around and parked on the street, facing the "bad corner." I was concerned but saw another car was parked right on the corner so that we were protected from collision. We go into the house. I took him the full length of the house to the far end. I say, "Let's start at the oldest part." It was a freshly remodeled room, empty of furniture, and freshly painted. I told him how this used to be a half-finished garage. I pointed out where the grape vines used to be. It was now a lovely wall with windows. We moved to the next room, the rec room. I pointed to the door. I said, "It used to be somewhere else. I still can't get used to it being there and it startles me when it opens. It too has been freshly remodeled." As he and I had driven up to the house, I had pointed out the rising creek that was in flood stage. I told him that sometimes the creek came right up to the door and sometimes came in and started to flood the house. [BL] (298 words)

I had some company and they left. I was tired and wanted to sleep. I could sleep sitting up in the van, passenger side, or sleep on the bench seat in the back. Both ways I'd be uncomfortable and cold, so I went to Thea's house and slept in a bed there. They weren't home. I woke up the next day and was getting ready to leave. I came out of the bedroom and found Thea and someone else there. She lectured me about taking advantage of her, using her house without permission, and she asked me if I had used anything else. I was quite annoyed with her. I wanted to leave. It didn't seem polite to leave in the middle of her lecture. She was angry. So was I. I felt guilty and caught but I also felt justified and annoyed. I wished I had chosen to sleep in my cold van. Then, I just decided to leave. I said, "Bye." She was miffed. I was then in a library, borrowing books. The female that was with Thea was also borrowing books. She was jealous of something. I talked to my brother Dwight. [BL] (195 words)

The kids sit at bottom of stairs and talk to you. You entertain them. Then I have the makeup all over my face to look old and peek in to see someone else doing it. The kids are staring at me. I laugh and say, "I guess I look funny with all this old lady makeup on." Then it is a bus and the driver (a fat ugly woman), gets out at a rest stop.

Ginny is helping me fix up/clean up my house. Will S comes in. We like each other. He starts to caress me and we initially agree, non-verbally, to make love. We take off our clothes and lay on the dining room table. At first, I am concerned because he's an older man and I think maybe he won't feel good, but he's strong and sensual and the experience is very enjoyable. It lasts a long time. There are interruptions. Ginny and her two sons come in and talk to me. We stop making love and I tell her to go away now. She looks hurt and wants to stay. I gently ask her to leave for awhile. Her sons are fighting. Will S tells them how to get along. Then a candle is burning near us. My mother appears and says, "Here, I'll move that, it can burn the wood, or your hair." I say firmly, "Here, give me back the candle," and firmly put it back where I want it. She looks hurt and looks around for something to straighten or fix. She leaves. Will S and I continue. I feel embarrassed because it is taking me so long. He understands and doesn't mind. It feels good. [BL] (208 words)

I'm listening to a tape cassette and ten recordings on it. I get the tape messed up and I'm trying to rewind it back on. I am concerned because it's important. Several women are laughing an sneering at me, like I'm stalling and trying to destroy the tape. A Rolls Royce comes and stops by me. A lot of people get out. The star (like Mickey Rooney), gets out. He comes to me and we kiss. His show comes through town every so often and he sees me then and then leaves. His entourage sneer at me. We go for a walk. We kiss. Then he says, "Sorry babe, time to leave now," he goes away, and then he comes back for the next visit. That is our relationship. He asks me how I've been. He asks me if I have practiced and if I'm walking better. I say, "Sure." Then he starts to say goodbye and leaves and then he turns and comes back. He says, "No, I'm staying. We'll stay together.

I'm in a class. Ethan is the teacher. In order to pass, I have to learn to shoot a rifle, drink Section 8 juice and jog. I'm back in M City. There's a male bully that challenges me. I get a new angle for my left angle, RA leaves, I jog to build up muscle tone. The Section 8 juice is light cider with a couple teaspoons of Section 9, which is hard cider. I practice hard. At the last day of class, I shoot a perfect bull's eye with a pump rifle and then with a 30-30. I drink twice as much Section 8 as anyone else. Everyone is amazed at my prowess. I'm proud. I wake up with the words "And the light follows." Oh, I just remembered that as I was practicing jogging, I ran past the old house in M City. It had been removed so that there was space and light for a small, cute, cozy apartment for an old lady. As I ran by, I peeked in the windows. There was no kitchen, because someone else did her cooking. I saw a pretty Afghan, multi-colored, and a rocking chair, a single bed, with lots of lovely windows.

I walk over and around lots of things to get to the side door to go out. I get lost in the corridors. I have shop lifted a couple of kitchen items, a potato peeler, and a salt shaker my daughter Dovre made. I feel embarrassed. I hope I don't get caught. I wonder why I did it?! A woman employee in a blue shop clerk jacket walks by and I hide the items. I look for directions. I see a sign that says "beds, l hotels go to heaven." I go out to the beach. I step over a stove (kitchen), that has an oil painting on it. I stand near the ocean. I see Dovre and Ellie playing in the waves. They are older, more developed physically.

I am the piano teacher. My pupil is a young man. We start warm up exercises in duo. We sound great on the scales. It sounds like Beethoven. Co-worker Tyler is in the audience. Bruce is also. They are favorably impressed. I say, "It's time to begin," and then I start to say, "You need to..." Ethan smiles and says, "Aren't I ever gentle?" He says just before I do, "Yes, with gentle people." [BL] (74 words)

It is Friday at 20 of 6. I am packing my briefcase to go home after a long week. I'm standing up. I see Dana coming towards my office. I feel tired and annoyed. I think, "Where's Andrea?," and I realize she's gone home and can't be reached by phone. I see I'm the only one around to help. I sigh. He comes in, sits down and sighs. He tells me how depressed and lonely he is and how he's thinking of suicide again. I resent his clinging to me emotionally. I guess he feels that he gets to talk out of the office. He says that he'll go now and maybe find someone else or maybe kill himself. I really get annoyed now because he's playing a manipulative game. I firmly yell down the hall, "Get back here! I'll work with you for 25 minutes. Quit playing these games! If you continue playing them, I'll wash my hands of you and you can do what you will with your life." He comes back angry at me. He wants sex. I say, "No, I don't want to." He says I'm mean, that I have no feelings and that I don't care for him. I say, "I care for you as a human being. I'll hug you, but that's all." He grabs me hard like he'll never let go. I hug him, truly feeling care for him. Then I release him and send him on his way. I' feeling food! I'd done what I could and left room and energy for me. I said no to a "stray kitten!" [BL] (268 words)

I am in my wheelchair, looking for a place to park near the theatre so I won't have to walk far. It's very crowded and I end up far away. I see an attendant, sort of a mechanic and chew him out because there is no disabled parking. He has an arrogant look on his face. He says, "Are you one of those hippie type trouble makers?" I look at him with some contempt and say, "I am a counselor here at XXX." He is very impressed. He offers to escort me there. As we walk together, arm in arm, he smiles and asks me out. I think, "He's only a mechanic, but it might be fun to go out for awhile." Then I find out that the person that is scheduled to play the Queen in the play can't, and I am to do it. I have an hour before curtain. Marti S tells me to make frowny faces to the sounds people make. We're all sitting at a table. I do so. One woman thinks I'm pretty strange. I'm nervous. I don't even know the story line much less the words! Marti S says, "No problem, you'll do fine," and then goes away. I wait for her but she doesn't return. Howard is the director of the play. I tell him I'm not ready. He says, "Sure you are." He has confidence in me and doesn't do anything to help me. I get a 12 hour extension. I then realize that I have the Queen characterization down very well, I just need to memorize the words. I feel that I can succeed. I wear a black ornate lacy dress and a wig. I am very regal.

It is necessary to study and learn more about femininity. I see a southern talking blonde, helpless type, and she changes into a well-dressed woman with a dark suit, a black picture hat and a red rose. She's beautiful, self-assured, and strong.

I am dancing. I have a very wealthy guardian and this is like a debutante ball. I'm wearing a blue velvet evening gown. The gown and I are very beautiful. I dance first with one good-looking man, then with the next and then with the next. There are 3 that are the best that I am interested in. One is blond. Then two men escort me to a sort of "throne" chair. They simultaneously pour liquids into my champagne glass, the mixture needed to be swirled to make champagne. Outside there is a battle of airplanes and ships. Then the news is that my "father" must be captured or killed to prevent more war. [BL] (114 words)

I'm going to see a movie. I see some chairs downstairs. I follow Juliet down the stairs. The stairs are clogged with coats, large art-type books, and people. I try not to step on the people. We chat as I go by. Then I look for a comfortable chair. I find one in the back. I ask Jock to carry it more forward so I can see better. He does. I find a pitcher of beer in my hand. Someone comments on it as I go by. I notice I don't have glasses. I make a joke and wonder why I have a pitcher (which the person called a vase). After all, I don't drink. Jock has 2 glasses. I say, "Leave it to you to think of the glasses." I ask his help in setting up the chair. It's just a bit too big for the small space and tips over the stair edge when I try to sit. I see wheelchair tires next to the stair edge that the feet of my chair are resting on. Jock says, "You know, I usually hold you back until you get all the facts (when he's giving me a client). I'm a little surprised and annoyed. He then is surprised at me and says, "I misunderstood you. I thought, you know, you said about alcohol and drugs and those guys you'd pick up on and I thought you didn't like people like that and wouldn't be good at helping them, so I didn't send any of them to you." I am surprised. [BL] (261 words)

A mentally retarded boy was the next act in a show. It had been smooth until he came on. He faltered on the first note and then couldn't get his bearings. I tried to help him out. If he could just calm down and remember the starting point, he'd be O.K. I was seated in a balcony seat that was very close to him. Then I started coughing and he was on his own. It was no good. The show ended ragged and unfinished when it had started so well. [BL] (90 words)

Take it back at once! I'll lose respect and love for you." I am very angry, and she goes back. She and I go to the clerk. I say, "She took this candy." The clerk shrugs and says, "Oh well, teens do that." A man walks up to me and puts a soda bottle on the counter. He says, "You pay for it and I'll reimburse you later."

I am visiting someone, I think Thea. I'm on the porch. The neighbors are around. A woman is talking. She says she's the land lady of a place up the street. There is a young couple that can't afford the rent. She's willing to cut the rent in half if others are willing to help raise the rest of the money. They ask me to donate. I hem and hah and finally agree to chip in 1 dollar. My daughter Dovre agrees to add some change. Then the girls go out to collect more money. We take it and some food to a gathering. I am thinking, "Maybe I'll keep my dollar since it was my girls that raised the money," but I feel shamed and cheap and leave it in. At the gathering, there are lots of people. A principal of the school asks me to compare my daughter's school with my own. I say, "There's not much to compare. There was the 1950's and now there's the 1980's but they are blended together. They are the same in many ways!" It's time to leave, I can't find my shoes, or the bowl the fruit came in. Then we find both. Out in the street, a strange looking midget walks by. As I go into a house, I hear Dovre calling for her dad piteously like he's drunk and lost in the neighborhood. [BL] (234 words)

He's scared. He throws himself face forward on the ground to protect himself. She is upset and angry because all she's got to contact is his back. She goes away. Eric sits up. There are tears in his eyes. He needs my support. He reaches over and envelopes me in a hug. The woman is crying too. She feels rejected. She's trying to pull Eric off me so she can be hugged by me. I tell her to wait. I say, "I know you feel badly and I want to help, but you have to understand. Eric's blind. You scared him. He needs me more." [BL] (141 words)

The girls and I are going swimming. I get in the shallow end and dog paddle around gingerly. Then I feel challenged to swim with long strokes out to the deeper area. I do so somewhat hesitantly. I stay near the pool edge and Dovre stays by to rescue me if necessary. We get out of the pool/lake. It's fairly crowded. We start to walk down the street. I have trouble walking because my both legs are in one pant leg, like in my mermaid suit. I kind of shuffle, hop along. Then it changes to normal and I walk. I notice a Christmas parade is coming down the street. It's colorful and noisy. We stop to watch it go by. My grandparents (Agnes & Clyde) are there and so is Aunt Esther. The parade is sort of happening through their living room. There are lovely, yellow, lemon-smelling candles. She sure has a lot of candles; her kids must be at that age. Grandma Agnes quarrels about a duck bowl. Rochelle is sitting on a piece of furniture doing a commercial. Half-way through, she runs out of things to day and hops down. I am annoyed at her. She finds a book and asks me to explain it to her. I start teaching about saying yes to a scene and not giving up. She seems to be interested. [BL] (228 words)

He's riding in some open air vehicle and has crows that talk. He sends one on ahead to give me the message that he's coming to visit. I hurry to get my friend out. I leave a message that I've gone to a small family birthday party at my brother's house next door and he can drop in if he wishes. I hope my good friend doesn't decide to drop by too.

Now I am swimming in a terribly treacherous white water river. I barely make it after crashing over a water fall. I creep up over the bank to safety. I go back to the prison and sneak down the stairs hoping no one sees me. I see chickens in the cells. I make it to the front office and bravely walk straight for the front door. No one stops me.

I am a maid of honor at a wedding. The colors are black and white. A black curvaceous 1950's dress and long white veil. I walk up the aisle and notice the groom isn't there. He then enters from a side door. Part of the ceremony is for the groom to describe the future. He's a little embarrassed. He takes his ribbons and artfully waves them around and tells how they will be married for a number of years and then he'll fall in love with another woman and leave. He shrugs his shoulders and looks sheepish. He asks her if she's willing to continue, knowing that. She says yes. The bouquets are black flowers and ribbons. The next step of the ceremony is for everyone to light a small candle and, while singing, put their flame into the common or larger flame of the bride. I light my candle and follow the bride, singing, realizing with embarrassment that the song is "Rashneeshee" and my parents are probably shocked. I like the symbolism of all our little lights coming together in one large light. I drip my candle wax in the bowl. She smiles and points out it made a crooked pattern. [BL] (202 words)

We go around and head for a narrow cement chute that was filled with sand, not water. We slide down fast. I'm in the front. The front crashes on the cement barrier and curls the front of the boat up.

I am hesitant because I'd already put my stuff in a bedroom. I go into the living room and sit on a couch. Leroy is there and there is instant attraction and warmth. He sits next to me, very close, and puts his arm around me. I know this is wrong, but I want it. I struggle with my conscience a little, but it's a foregone conclusion. He complains bitterly how he never measures up to his father's expectations. A stray kitten and a cousin. It's a double reason to stay away, but I love being near him. I feel warmth and excitement.

Later a dream about finishing drinking something I had left. Some women are spies and were chosen for a series of features, one of which is they had a miniature silver shoe. I saw a lot of miniature desks lined up. They belonged to Cherry T. I opened one drawer and saw a diary book, about joy. I apologized for looking at her private material. [BL] (65 words)

I am swimming in calm waters and doing very well. I swim toward a rock at the deep end. As I near the rock, I realize I'm getting tired out and need to hang on. I reach for the rock and become aware of evil things lurking under the rock. I slide around the rock and discover I'm in the rough ocean side and feel like I might not make it. I struggle and finally get back to the calm waters and feel safer. [BL] (84 words)

I am looking at images of what went wrong in our marriage. Lots of snapshots, interviews; I remember the color black. I am helping my bad ex-husband set up a shower. It's a lot of tall, ungainly pipes. Between us we get it set up and the cold water pours out of the shower head. I take a cold, cold shower. I am fully clothed and find a small sample bottle of shampoo in my shirt pocket. I wash my hair and arms. I feel very invigorated by the shower because it is so cold. I step out and walk jauntily past my ex-husband and all the pictures. A voice (maybe my brother, Jake) says, "Now, do me a favor. Give him the shampoo. You can work together a little bit." I realize I had selfishly kept the bottle, which had only cost 75 cents. I gave it to him. [BL] (150 words)

A young girl has rheumatoid arthritis. Some people are trying to explain things to her to help her. I am crying. A nice man is going to help her. I think I am worried they can't and don't want to stir up her hopes. The man and I go into his familiar formal room. He tells me to look into a mirror with a heavy, gilded frame. I look and at first I can't see anything. Then I see me, sad, seated and a man (him). I, a happy, healthy me, stand between them trying to explain something. [BL] (98 words)

Lucy is driving my car. I am giving her directions, like backup. "Go straight. Stop now! You've only got another foot to a slight drop off." I couldn't imagine why I just didn't do the driving. It would be easier and safer. Jake is in the pickup as well. We are in a parking lot. We park and get out. Jake is being very apologetic and I say, "Don't over help." They go ahead and I try to catch up. I call out, "Sandy." I'm in an intersection. A crowd is gathering. There is some ceremony where money is being given to a disability cause. I see Lucy and Jake and then I am crowded in by many, many tall men. I look around and exclaim, "So tall! It's not fair!" They can see well. I'm all smashed up against some guy's beige polyester suit. Cameras are everywhere. They can't see me I'm so crowded in. Some man says,"Where do we donate?" And a man says, "It's already been done." The money's here already and I notice I'm standing right at the center of the attention where a round baseball is. The crowd has suddenly thinned out. The cameras are gone. The excitement is over.

Lucy sits next to me at a restaurant, long table. She announces that she is naked under her blanket. She just didn't feel like wearing clothes. We are tasting food. The wife of the restaurant owner wants our opinion. I want to leave and go home. The "games" there are uncomfortable. First I'm going to shampoo my hair. I am in a room and a man watches. I use too much shampoo and spill it into a small container. Now Elizabeth Taylor is taking a bath. A man in a leather jacket comes in, opening 3 wallets with credit cards and money. He says, "This is what I offer. All you have to give is you." I'm a little disgusted and want Elizabeth to leave but she doesn't want to. So I leave. [BL] (133 words)

I am in a wheelchair. Someone says, "Let's go downstairs and make fresh bread." I pull my chair around me like a deflated flotation device. I call Michael over. He's driving a two-seater with a small truck bed behind it, quite fancy. I ask him if he were to get a set of tools, which ones would he get? I don't want him to know I'm thinking of getting him some tools as a gift. A man calls us over. He's upset we're all in chairs, or maybe I'm thinking he might be upset. He says, "Well, for instance, what if I was black instead of white?" Lucy says it wouldn't make any difference to her. She's blind. [BL] (118 words)

Some woman is annoyed with me because she gave me some information and I didn't get it back to her. I agree to get it for her. I get the papers and remember I was going to xerox it first -- it's a lot of information on music. I take it to a xerox machine. An office worker wants to know if I've been watching Hank because he has refused to make a copy of what he was supposed to copy. I say, "No, I haven't." Hank walks in and I say, "Hi Hank," to alert the other woman not to talk about him. I try to xerox. It is hard. There is a lot to copy. I ask Jock to help me. He does. Then I have to go to my dorm room to get more knitted clothes that belong to the woman. We pass a busy military-like man who has helicopter-like machine displays. Get to my room and Jock/Abner gets the clothes, sometimes getting my own clothes almost mixed up with the others. I look up at the ceiling and say, "What happened to my ceiling?" It has ribbon bows on it and the asbestos is on it. It's a mess. Someone explains, but I don't remember the reason. [BL] (211 words)

I am at Thea's house and can't get what I want. Someone tells me that Howard has died. I think, "Oh, so young. Only 44 years old." I feel sad and know it will be sadder over the next few days. I go to get my car, which is broken. There are two, a van and a spiffy car. I think, "I can't use the car because my chair won't fit in." The mechanic is busy and tells me he can't fix it yet and gives me a reason. I tell him I need it because Howard died and that is a stronger reason. He doesn't care. I then remember there will be an inheritanc, but I will have to fight for it. I think, "I'll use the inheritance to get a degree in psychology, another two years of school." I sit in a chair like the swim lift chair and want it to go forward, but someone set the brakes and it tries to go forward like a train (chug chug chug chug) and folds over itself and is broken.

I go to find Lucy. I knock at her door. One of her children calls, "Come in." I see that most of the furniture is moved out. I ask if Lucy is here. "She's in the kitchen." So I walk to the kitchen and look out the back window and see her grooming her horse. I remember she loved that horse and must be feeling sad to leave it. A phone rings and she tells one of the kids to be sure and answer it. I realize that I will be able to talk to her if she comes in to get the phone. I walk toward the phone in the living room. Lucy comes in,; she is naked. She gets up on the wooden rickety table (the only furniture left) and undoes the lamp fixture in the ceiling. There are lots of cobwebs. She tells the girls to be careful of the strings. I say, "I know you're busy, but could you tell me, in a nutshell, what made you do this? Just a few months ago, you were not going to have him and now you're gone." [BL] (189 words)

I am looking for my purse. So is Merle. I find it. I'm going upstairs to have lunch. I am run over and lay on the ground. A doctor comes over and says, "Don't move," and sticks pins in me. I realize I don't feel them. I say, "Oh no! Don't tell me it's my spine." He says, "Maybe not. Sometimes things are numb for a while." The man that ran over me comes to the emergency room as I'm being wheeled in on a stretcher. He says, "I was drunk." I am furious and scream at him that he ought to be hung up by his balls upside down for 100 years. That would teach him a lesson. I am livid. His father says, "We'll talk about this when you calm down." I then have to walk slowly up some difficult stairs to the emergency room. They see me and come running to help me up the last stair. A black woman is there and the nurse jokes about her color being a permanent tan. The black woman says someday people won't be afraid and will treat me normally. [BL] (190 words)

I am taking the wet clothes off a baby. She is lying on a bed and is a mess. I look for a clean shirt and find several. I choose one that's lacy and pretty, but hard to get on her. We struggle getting her hand in the arm and finally succeed. Then I take off her messy diaper and clean her up. She shits when I don't have a diaper on her. I clean that up, shuddering. Now my mother says, "Give the baby to me and you count all this money on my bed." I see piles and piles of coins (change). Most of them are foreign currency. What a tiring task. I say, "I'd rather hold the baby. I haven't had a chance to." She says, "Later, you can do it later." I sigh and start working on the money. Then I'm helping a woman pack. There are lots of snap shots laid out on the bed, some of Willie, some of her lover. I am concerned that her husband will come in and find out! I try to gather them up. Then I must hurry and I choose the shoes to pack, discarding several "Baby Jane" shoes for little girls. [BL] (204 words)

I'm at a grocery store hoping to meet a nice man I can be in relationship with. This short but good-looking guy comes up and kisses me. I say, "Hey, who are you? Don't do that." I walk away from him. He follows. I see Merle in a shopping cart. I tell him, "This boy came up and kissed me." Merle is a little jealous. I go back into the store looking for a guy. As I'm ready to leave, I find Raul and another guy. We walk out with Merle and Ginny and some others. I say to Raul, "Don't be like you were before; be natural and real." He agrees. Someone says, "To whose couch do we go?" I offer my house. We go to a campground. Raul says he's read about Emily Dickinson. I say, "Yeah, me too. She's into natural drugs." Some people take the campsite we were headed for. We get into a van and drive up a freeway exit the wrong way and cut across wooded area to park next to the original campsite. Ginny has money in her hand. I say, "There isn't any wood for the fire," and then I see some split logs and sticks. [BL] (204 words)

I'm going to teach a lecture on forest fires to a 3rd (4th is crossed out) grade class. I am practicing the lecture with their teacher. I am apologizing that I don't have much content information. I go to the library to find an encyclopedia to get more information. I'm going to show maps and talk about how the fires burn off all the old tangled growth that leaves room for new growth. Then, as we are going to the classroom, the thing shifts and we are now going to a cafe, De Frisco's, to reminisce on the Germany Trip with 3 or 4 other women. We sit around a table. I suggest another member of the Germany group show her pictures. But just before she starts, I pull mine out and start with the Palace of Versailles. I find as I start talking, I have lots to say and it is interesting to the others. Then we decide to play baseball. I hit a ball and run for first base and was nearly "put out." The base was real close. Then I show someone a lovely wooden panel I was allowed to bring back from Paris. It fit on top of a piano we had here. Then we had to move a table that had pretty things on it back to make more room for second base. The table leg slipped and some things fell. We decided we'd meet again to finish our talks as we'd already been there 4 hours. I wrote the names of the ones who will speak and in what order. I consulted with Rena who said she would do her talk if she'd had enough to drink. [BL] (283 words)

I am in a house and it is crowded with lots of things and furniture. A small bird and a large blow fly come rushing in. I think it's a bee but someone reassures me it's a fly. There is a mask in a basket with a lid. I give it to a small boy and he takes it outside and dumps the old, musty, moldy mask. I feel relief. Suddenly the house is nearly empty. Lots of space. Only a stove moved in from a rental (our original old stove) and a table are left and I like it this way. The boy brings back the empty basket and I almost accept it back, but change my mind and give him the basket. I don't want it because it carries the odor and feel of the mask. I am outside. Two guys are up a telephone pole fixing the lines. They are hanging up there in a way that seems impossible, but they seem comfortable. One is there to "spot" the other guy in case he gets in trouble. They finish and come down the ladder and efficiently pack up their equipment. It was very graceful; each knew how to do each task and they just did whatever was closest at hand. I ride my wheelchair around their truck watching them and then I go to my front door and park the chair and walk in. [BL] (237 words)

I finally drive in the gas pump line and get gas. I then start to drive to C City but must get out of the car because of a group of people parading down the street. Chuck is in the parade. A male friend calls out, "You owe me a quarter." I search my pockets and only find a nickel. Chuck digs up a quarter. I say, "Well then now, I owe you a quarter." I start to walk to C City. Aunt Bridget and her daughter walk with me a short way. I think,"I hope I can make it." My knees have really been hurting. I then walk up and crawl up a stairway. There are handouts about counseling techniques on the steps. [BL] (156 words)

I do a cheerful, charming rap. Some people come in. We are talking about relationships. I am dancing alone and enjoying dancing to the music. I start to join another woman dancing alone, but then chose to dance alone. Then this man and I discuss what kind of relationship to experiment with. He says "good friend and boyfriend first."

Lucy needs a lawyer. Michael J. Fox (Darryl) takes on the job. He and I are crossing a huge river on a bridge. I see a prehistoric rhino go into the river. "Nice neighborhood," I say sarcastically. The bridge becomes a stairway in a high-rise office building. At first we are going down to leave the building, but then we change and are going up to get to the protection of his father's office. I am glad because then our relationship has a chance. The furniture is rich and lovely. We sit in the dining room. Later, a secretary shows us where the spare blankets and rollaway bed is, only now we're stuck with her. She has three pink poodles, one a male. We laugh at how silly they look! Then, there's a whole crowd of people with us. I remember the lights are on and maybe someone outside has noticed and will come rescue us. I am embarrassed that I'd not thought to flash the lights to signal for help (I am aware I really didn't want help). The elevator now starts to work, but breaks down again. Everyone else uses the elevator. I hang back hoping to be last, with him. [BL] (203 words)

Then our session is over and I get up and go to the front door to look out. I see bushes across the road burning and her front garden and lawn has been flooded. The water hose is still on. I say, "Those vandals I heard about on the news were here! I'd best call the police. They've ruined your garden." She goes out to look. I call the police. I dial "0" and ask for the police. They are on the line very quickly. I say, "My name is Barb Sanders and I'm at...." "Hey," I yell to her, "What's your address here?" She tells me and I tell them. Then I describe the damage. I say, "You can even see their footprints." I hang up and wait for them. Then I hear her out there cleaning up the mess. I go out and say, "Don't do that. You'll ruin the evidence. You'll cover it up." I am concerned. I decide to go home. She gives me the tape of our session and says, "Don't work on this tonight. You've worked hard enough today." I say "OK. Maybe I'll just listen to it once." I smile because I realize I still intend to work on it. Then I look around for my car. I can't see it anywhere. I say, "Wouldn't I have parked it close to the house, so I wouldn't walk so far?" She walks up the side yard to look. I say, "Wait!

They've been waiting for someone with the proper skills to show up. A writer. I get to be historian, or scrap book person. I'm not too thrilled. Then Rita and I walk to the beach down a steep path. I look out across the ocean and I see huge waves and a heavy, threatening sky. A bad storm is coming. We are concerned about some of our group who are out on boats. Will they get back safely? I pick up some of Rita's vials and eye drop things (German Rita who is visually impaired). I don't get them all. I go back to the huge dorm-like house. The group meets. Ellie and Paulina are in swimsuits and want to go down to a little swim. I say, "No. It's too dangerous." They are hard to convince, but they return with us. The male leader says, "It's confirmed.

I had been packing to go visit my mother and I find the dream book. I open it to a dream where a beautifully drawn picture is on the page and the dream was written over it. I am very impressed.

Dolores M is trying on some clothes at a store. I see that the hooks to hang the clothes are way up high too high to reach. They follow the slope of the stairs. I say, "That's silly. Why did they do it that way?" Dolores has very heavy makeup on her face. She's here to interpret for the deaf. As I am standing, talking to her, two or three men of color, one black, one or two Native Americans, crowd around me very close. The black man is softly kissing my neck from behind. The Native American man is to my right, talking softly. Another stands some distance from us, but he and I are talking with our eyes and occasionally words. Now I'm seated in the front row. A show of some kind (fashion perhaps) will soon begin. I see a baby and ask to hold it. His blankets are all wrinkled up, so I lay him down on the floor to straighten the blanket up. I end up with the baby in a metal box that cramps the baby's legs up. I hold the baby to my chest and am concerned if it can breathe because the metal lid has closed. I open it some and say, "Boy, this baby sure doesn't like this!" I feel a little sorry I'd gotten it in this predicament. [BL] (228 words)

I go into the bathroom and I see a pretty village scene when I look down into the toilet. I am talking to someone just outside the door. I am looking up my brother Dwight's telephone number in my blue address book, but I can't find it. I see: Corinne 470, Lydia 475, A.S, Halloween 472, Kesi, Keshi, Kassee. There were other words and numbers. I laugh at Lydia and I'm nostalgic about the Halloween event. [BL] (111 words)

Someone looked at my hair and said, "Do you like it?" I said, "Oh yes. It's soft and pretty. I like my hair." There was a feeling that my hair looked bad in that it wasn't "properly" fixed by culture standards, but it was surprising that I accepted and liked me as I was. [BL] (54 words)

A girl is being noisy and interrupting. I get into a power play with her. I insist she be quiet and polite and I shake her. I put her in a high box. She starts goofing off and I insist she sit on the outside lip of the box so I can keep an eye on her. Then later I swim alone in the pool, relieved to have a few moments of quiet time.

I'm in an auditorium. Susie S is concerned at her part in this disability awareness spoof we are preparing. I ask, "Why not do it? Lots of AB's represent us in a patronizing way. Why shouldn't we represent ourselves in a good, funny way?" I watch the video we all made. It is funny. I try to sit on a folding chair. Some guy in front talks to me. Merle is in the audience somewhere. [BL] (75 words)

I am organizing things: putting birthday cards I'd received where they can be displayed better so I can see them. Then I go downstairs and We and my mother play 'wait til you see his new girlfriend' (Jake/Nate's cousin). I go to the kitchen door and she's there looking pouty and cute. "Where's Whoopie?" she lisps. I laugh and look in at my mother and Lydia. "She's here," I giggle. "Is Whoopie anywhere?" I accept her way of lisping. My mother whispers to me, "Be careful! She's powerful." I laugh and lead her upstairs to find "Whoopie." She follows arrogantly, telling where she'll put her things. She looks older now, maybe 50, 55. Then Jake runs past saying hurriedly, "It's almost time for the Royal." We all run after him. Now we're like in India and the royal procession is approaching and we must be at our appointed place in time before the King arrives. One man calls our "Elephant" and doesn't even stop running as he hops up on a running elephant. He sways as he rides. We arrive at the stairs and are nearly too late. But protocol says that pushy women must go first. "Hurry! You first," says Jake. She just grins and refuses. "Now we're in trouble! If she won't go, we can't go and then the King will be upset!" I say, "Let me talk to her!" Jake says, "No, I'll take care of it." He pulls out his penis and twists it so that a hand rolled cigarette comes out of the end of his penis! He's going to sit and smoke it until he thinks of a solution. I am a little disgusted at the idea of putting it in his mouth as it will be a little slimy from the sperm! [BL] (299 words)

Terence (my cousin) is dying. But before he can die, he must remember his memories. I am helping him. His eyes flutter and I think he's going, and then he wakes up and tells me more memories. He especially focuses on one weekend we shared together, something about the M City house. He says it was this room before it was remodeled and I look and realize it was the original room. He'd made a mistake. It was the old pool table room, only empty of furniture. [BL] (87 words)

I am sexually excited and want to make love, but no one is around. So I decide to wait for Howard to return. It's been a long time since I've made love to him and it will please him. I feel a little uncomfortable about such a gift because I may be opening myself up to more sexual advances from him than I'll want. So I sit and wait. [BL] (69 words)

I am showing a story book to someone and explaining that even before you start reading the book, the story is there in the symbols. I show them the cover and I see a night starry sky -- expansive earth and a hint of a person and I say, "See, here is a night sky, symbolizing intuition and the unknown. Here is Mother Earth, solid, foundation. Here is a person, etc. Then I turn the page and see animals: a horse (steady friendship), a rabbit (sweet and playful but loud out toward the end, tricky), etc. [BL] (96 words)

Jake is embarrassed for me and asks if I'm not embarrassed because I was fired. I say no, because I wasn't fired. It wasn't a real mistake. It was a paper and pencil mistake at the bank. Maybe I did send it in just a little late, but that's not a mistake. [BL] (52 words)

I go through a huge store to the back room. I'm tired and lie down on a bed. Suddenly I wake up to discover John (a man I work with) has crawled into bed with me, and he's naked. I pull the covers up around me and say, "What are you doing?" He's shy but insistent. He wants to make love, to get closer to me. He tries to kiss me. I am annoyed. I certainly don't want to make love to this wimp; what nerve! I say, "No. We can't. I'm your supervisor and it isn't ethical." I then think he'll be hurt, so I say, "I admire your courage to get naked and come here asking, but I don't want this." Just then through an open window I see people leaning out of their windows in the hotel across the street yelling, "Happy New Year" and blowing horns. I look at the clock and, sure enough, it's a few minutes past 12. [BL] (164 words)

I am a teenager and some guy is joining us, but I don't trust him. Our teacher, Gary, calls us together and asks us, "What do you think of this new guy? Does he seem a little sleazy or not "true" to you?" "Yeah!" we agreed. I say, "He doesn't feel right, like he lies." "Yeah," says Gary. "Well, what if I just flat out say, 'No booze or drugs'? That would take care of the scotch problem right there. It's tough, but real." We agreed. Paulina says, "But he might have a problem getting back in with his friends. If he's a flirt, then he won't fit in any more." I think it's interesting that a lesbian is concerned that a drunk be able to continue his noisy, flirty, sexist ways. I disagree and start talking about if his attitude is OK, he can fit in and still have fun even if he's off the booze and drugs. As I'm talking, suddenly little lights zip up to me and surround me. I look up at Gary startled. I realize these are aliens that are taking me away, and as I start rising (still in cross-legged, seated position), I yell, "Gary!" And then I yell, Goodbye!" I see them all staring at me in astonishment and sadness. I feel a little scared and sad as I see the tree as I rise up and up. (I suddenly wake up relieved I wasn't disappearing into the cosmos.)

I'm in a store and Bonnie is pushing my manual wheelchair. I see big crystals and jewelry. I start to go outside and see a man watching me. He seems friendly and I am attracted to him. Bonnie waits for me in the car. I go out and he's out there. I see a turtle with a leather coat over his shell. The man says, "May I have that?" He really wants it. I agree. We circle it and it starts coming closer to me. I back up into the comfortable arms of the man. The turtle comes very close and bites me. I see a tiny bloodless paper cut and say, "Ouch! Is it poisonous?" The man says, "No. It's harmless." [BL] (122 words)

I'm swimming in the ocean. I've been shipwrecked and am swimming for my life. Some buoy that looks like a giant bottle is floating and moving away from me. I must catch it or drown, and I do get it and rest on it. I look up and see heavy surf. It is very dangerous. People are boating past me and I yell out, over and over, "Help me. Help me." They don't hear and then I wake up on shore, safe, and I cry and cry in relief. I don't know how I made it alive, but I did. [BL] (100 words)

I'm in a small room that has dirt and debris and bugs in it. I see a tiny (Alice in Wonderland) door and, curious, I open it. I see an ugly man there and say, "Uh oh, guess I shouldn't have opened the door." I shut it quickly. I decide I don't want this room to be so bad, so I marshal my forces and change things. (I am aware I'm dreaming) and command the bugs to straighten things up. They march around in lines and I walk carefully so as not to smash any of them. I am repelled by them and grateful to them. They do miraculous work. In fact it is lovely and has opened up into more rooms, including the room the man had been in. I go down a hallway toward the bedrooms. I see video games. Then I see a 3-D video behind glass of real people enacting ordinary human activities. I'm like a voyager watching them. I feel sad that I'm reduced to such a lowly act. I see sexual activity and feel an orgasm. [BL] (182 words)

Then I do and find a grumpy woman to ask directions. She takes me down a long hall, complaining that she can't breathe as she walks and hangs her shirt on a clothes line with herself in it so she can rest.

I am standing on a small piece of land. There is a huge body of water to my left and in front of me. A single tree stands to my right. Someone says, "Here's the forest." I laugh and say, "Some forest!" There is one tree left. All the rest have been chopped down. I see two people seated under the water. I wonder how they can breathe. One rises up and starts approaching me. I get scared because this is a "siren," a spirit that wants to lure me away. She starts to bite on my ankle. I move so that she ends up biting the base of the ancient tree. If I'd let her bite me, I'd have been a goner. She hovers near and keeps trying. I must focus my energies on keeping away from her. I see a single line of ancient trees stretched out in front of me (in single file), the last remains of a huge and lush forest. The land is totally barren. I must walk across the cut branches (stumps) to get to safety. The water roils and seems threatening. [BL] (188 words)

I am now returning to the acting class. I go too far down the hall to a room where ritzy, well-dressed people are. I back track and find the room. The woman teacher is there and I ask her if she would mind if I could be an assistant director. She says, "How will this help?" I start counting on my fingers how it would help. "First, for me," I say and I pause and repeat it because it felt selfish to say for me first. But I decide it is proper and I say, "For me, I would gain skills and experience. For you, after I learn blocking, I could run some of the rehearsals and you could have time off." "I'll have to ask the class," she says. I agree and point out one woman will say no. She doesn't like me. So I tell the class how I've married this Protestant. They ask if my father is angry. I say, "No because I divorced my Catholic family." Then a woman sadly says, "At first, he won't read your letters and then later, when he dies, he'll speak of you in his last words." She cries. "It was like that with her dad," someone says. "But your sister will be angry and hurt." I agree it was like that with my father. They vote me in, all except the one woman. [BL] (233 words)

A good-looking man likes me. I decide it's time to do my cleansing ritual. He suggests I do it in the fireplace in the living room with the 25 people seated at the tables watching. I laugh and say, "No way. The space is too small and all those people watching." I imagine they would all politely clap their hands after I accomplished my task, saying in cool, clipped accents, "That's nice B." The guy and I laugh at the silliness of their British audience routine. I say, "I'll do it in the swimming pool." Hasani says, "It's too cold." I say, "I only have to do it for three minutes.

I am young and kissing my beau. He wants more and I sense it. I say, "Do you want more of this?" He says yes. I say, "I have to go to the bathroom and think about it. Really." So I go into a bathroom and sit on a toilet and pee, and then I walk out to him and hug him, kissing him passionately and say, "Yes." He is so happy and we walk arm in arm, really connected and in love. We pass Jake and Valerie all dressed up and walking together, Jake's arm around Valerie. We are at the Hilton. I smile at them, but they don't respond. I say to my guy, "Maybe she didn't recognize me because I'm standing." She then comes back and says, "Hi." We all walk together. Jake and my guy used to work together and Jake has made it big. He gives my guy 90 (0?) percentage, which pleases him. We walk out past a display in a museum where we see Basaltic rock columns rising and falling. The narrative tells us that that's where the Killer Bees live and thank God, they are disappearing so there's less bees. I see two naked men tortured by being covered with these bees. One man opens his mouth at their command to let them in and out. He is in extreme pain. It is horrible. The bees stored honey in his nipple. I feel sick and walk away. [BL] (245 words)

I am walking down the corridor of a hospital and see a new born baby in his bassinet in the hall. The mother is upset and the baby is crying. I go to the baby and caress his head and send "loving" vibes to it. It calms down and sleeps. The nurses are very impressed with my ability and ask me to help out with the preemie's who may die if not nurtured. I go to the nursery and am handed a tiny baby that fits into my hands, so unformed, it's face doesn't have skin yet, just muscle and red. I lay it on my left arm and cuddle it. I concentrate all my loving energies toward it. Now the baby looks like a baby. I go to a sink and put water on my arms as that is better for the baby. I feel a need to pee, but can't leave the baby even for a moment. A nurse suggests she get me a bed pan. I try to feed the baby and suddenly it starts sucking at the thin drops of "mother's milk" I offered on a tiny tube/stick. At first I'm concerned she will choke, but she really is eating and swallowing, gaining strength. I am pleased and in awe. She's gaining weight. She is surviving! [BL] (220 words)

Third dream: I am standing on a sidewalk and a beautiful Indian man stands at my left. He's a dancer and the music is calling him. He starts to dance away and turns, smiling to invite me to dance with him. He'll teach me how to dance. As we are walking, the scene changes and we are walking into a cathedral. I think to myself, "How odd. Why am I dreaming a catholic church?" Then I notice it's a Mexican Mission. We are drawn in as a part of the crowd. We go upstairs and move to seats very close to another Indian man who is preparing his instrument. I am equally attracted to him and go closer. He has a guitar with a printer in it. Other objects are attached to it to make unusual music. I say to my friend, "Look, He has a large mosquito tied to a string." It hums and he amplifies it when it's appropriate. Unique instruments. Later, my dancing friend and I are in a car. He's in the driver's seat and we're about to drive away. (I'm in the passenger seat.) I look out the window and see a two-story house with windows that roll down like car windows and most of them are open. I see two huge bears (grizzlies) starting to get out the windows. I tell my Indian man and he gets out to stop them. I see the two bears followed by a dog running away. In the sky are a helicopter and several planes. I begin to cry, left all alone in the car.

After church, there's a Bible study group and we are there. I feel sleepy and lean back to nap. Grandma does too and then she gets up on the back of the curved couch to lay down, like a cat would, her feet hit the face of a man in the group, she scoots over to my side. I smile to see her like that. Then I say, "It's after 2:00, can we leave pretty soon?" She agrees and I start packing up my supplies, disks, pencils, papers, to take with me. I leave six pencils that might have been the church's property, hoping I don't take their stuff with mine. We drive off. [BL] (176 words)

I'm in an old run-down house. The floor boards of my bedroom are rotted through and a hole is developing. I'm in bed near a stairwell. I realize some of the clothes on my floor have slid down into the hole. I wonder where my father is. He could fix the hole. I reach for the clothes and slide into the hole myself and fall under the house in a horrible pile of debris that is rotting away. I feel fear that I will rot with it. I fight my way back up into the house and walk down the hall asking where everyone is. Dwight is in his room, the furthest one away. My mother's in her room. I'm near the front door and a monster from hell comes at me. I am very afraid but stand my ground. I grab its tongue at its roots and pull, even though I know he'll bite me and it will be terribly painful. I poke his eye with a stick and drag him out of the house. He's unconscious and I crawl back to the house with a match. I light the carpet on the porch, wondering if I should go in first and get our possessions, but it is more important to torch it at once. I light it. The monster comes at me, but is consumed in the flames. I look to make sure all my family is safely out of the house.

I am approaching a barn, it is old, dilapidated and ugly. Inside is darkness and rotting, stinking stuff that I am supposed to clean up. I don't want to, and as I am walking to the door, I veer away, deciding not to do it. I then walk across a grassy pasture to a muddy embankment. I accidentally slip and fall, sliding down the embankment to a muddy area that is like quicksand. I am flat on my back and sinking, trapped and I know there is no way out. I am as good as dead. My sister Lydia is with me and she is already below the mud line. I see she is still alive because her eyes open and shut. It is almost time for me to go under. I feel fear and resistance, but I don't panic. I go under and am amazed I can still breathe. A wash of water goes over us, rising us, floating, out of the mud. We crawl out onto the grass. Then we get up, hugging each other and walking toward our house, which is around the left side of the barn. There are a series of Quonset huts like married student housing at OSU. The first one on the left is ours. It is old, the paint is peeling. I open the door and walk in. I see a blue cotton print dress on a dress form and I say, "Hi, Mama." I realize it is a symbol of my mother. I see movement in the bedroom, my "father" is sick and old and in bed. I don't want to go in, but I do. His face is bumpy and old-looking.

He moves his hand to cause my dress to fall more revealingly to show more leg. Then he sits next to me, his arm now around me. He asks me to dance. I agree. He pulls me close.

I am told that my sister Lydia died. I am shocked and sad. I'm sort of in shock and it takes awhile for the full feelings of sorrow to sink in. Some part of me seems removed, distant, almost objectively curious. I suddenly remember to ask my mother how she died. My mother said the four of them went to dinner at the Bates Restaurant. They all ate the same food and they all got sick, but Lydia must have eaten the worst, most poisoned part, and she died. They all threw up and had slimy, sticky diarrhea, but Lydia died from it. I shake my head in sorrow. She was so young and good and had so much to live for. Then I amend that part, living with Darryl, how could she look forward to living more? Cousin Patricia comes by to give me some photos she had of Lydia. It's tradition, when someone dies, people give back their photos to the loved one. I remember returning Terence's pictures to her.

Suddenly "my little girl" is there too and we start floundering. She goes under and I have a terrible dilemma. Do I let go of the one to save the other and endanger myself as well? I dive for her and find her. Now I'm working hard to keep all of us afloat. I see a huge rubber life raft and we get in it, only it must have a leak in it because it's very limp and water is getting in. We fold up the limp parts and I ask the girls to bail. We manage to stay afloat. We float over to an opening in the wall and I see monsters, three ugly things. They capture me and put me in a cage with it hanging over some boiling oil or black sewage gunk. If I don't choose one of these uglies to marry, they'll dump me in the gunk. I don't know which fate is worse. I decide to choose one of the uglies. [BL] (200 words)

I see a bear off in the distance. It's the one my father, an Indian Chief, has happily pursued and hunted for years. It's his great joy to try and capture this bear. It is coming toward me and I must protect myself or it will kill me. I have my father's .22 rifle. I shoot at the bear over and over, but it only enrages him and he's close now. I aim for the eye and shoot and shoot. Now he's on top of me, mauling me. I keep shooting and finally it dies. I crawl out from under it and crawl, bleeding and maimed, to my father's horse. I put my father's rifle in the holster on the saddle and ride back to tell my father I have killed his bear. I am worried he will be upset because I've brought to an end his favorite sport. I see a small, naked Native American man. He's out of shape and his body fat is down around the belly and hips. He tries to suck it all in and his chest rises to look more manly. [BL] (187 words)

A man, Claude, is dancing ballet on stage with a group. I am watching from backstage. It all looks fun, cultural and nice, I keep moving around to see him better. I realize I'm sort of on stage at one point and move out of the way. After the dance, he comes over. We are shy, but like each other. I'm seated on a chair and he sits on the same chair. We are close and talking. Then he puts me on his lap. I hope I don't weight too much. I wish I'd lost some weight. We have coffee/tea, drink and chat, really enjoying each other's company.

Now I'm in a room full of women. They are all talking and laughing. They throw dice. I am annoyed, perhaps tired and sleepy, and suggest that I throw the dice and if I win, they have to clear a quadrant of the room so I can have it to myself to sleep and have quiet. They are insulted but agree. I throw two big fluffy dice and I can't count the round black buttons correctly. At first it looks like 8 or 9. Then a woman says its 4 20's. That means I won. Someone suggests I go out and sleep in the hall, where one of the dice had rolled. I am agreeable; it's further from the noisy chatter; but I stay in the room and sleep on my quadrant that I won. I wish they'd quiet down so I could sleep (curled up on the floor.) [BL] (149 words)

A woman is the boss. She tells us what to do. We volunteer to help at a store. It's been a hard day and I'm starting to go home. I pass a beat-up car in the grass and think I've seen that image before. Why am I seeing it again? It must mean something. Maybe I dreamed it. Another woman and I walk past (I'm in my wheelchair) the candy section in the store. She pulls off a box and opens it. I remember we get things for free because we work there. I say, "Wait," and turn to look at the selections. I see the ice-cream section and wonder if there's any sugar-free ones. I see the cookie section. There's a machine. The boss woman put dough in it and huge, sticky rolls come out. They aren't quite done right, a bit doughy but still delicious. People are eating them. I try a bite, wondering if all that sugar will affect my irregular heart beat. The boss woman is crazy and goes off. I guess she dies. The other woman says to me, "At least I talked Sweet Liberty from walking." She felt proud of that. (Sweet liberty is a woman who is upset at the crazy boss woman and almost left.) I offer to help at the counter and the other woman says no, there's not much I can do, being disabled. All I could do would be the easy parts that everyone wants to do, like the cash register. I say, "Now don't be too hasty. Let's check it out. I might be more help to you than you think." [BL] (273 words)

I get out of the car and run. They chase. I go into my house and try to lock doors. I call 911 and hide under the telephone table. The woman who answers the phone is a nurse. She's impersonal and taking her time. I ask her to tell the police to come to 837 A. Street. [the names Steven V and Victor, a feeling of lots of mean men are out to hurt me. [BL] (99 words)

A man and a woman want to make love and are looking for a place where they can be private. A man hides in closets and the woman goes from closet to closet looking for him. She sees a boy coming to the closet to hang up his hats. This bothers her because he'll find their closet and interrupt. He goes in and is now in his own room. Three puppets are hung up on the hat rack. He's afraid of one of them because it has huge black circles for eyes and looks scary. He calls to his daddy who says there's nothing to worry about. Then the two male puppets are moving and talking. One turns to the other and wants to make love, so the other one becomes a "female" and they have sex. I feel orgasm. A voice says, "That's OK, they are doing this because they are not really homosexual, they are both" (meaning bi-sexual). [BL] (160 words)

I turn to Aunt Millie and say, "She is so annoying." Aunt Millie says, "You should have seen her as we grew up!"

Mary is laying in the bathtub taking a bath. My bath chair is out and I am standing, intending to bathe standing and wondering if I'll be able to stand that long. Nancy comes in to scrub Mary's back and I sit on the toilet to have a watery bowel movement and hope it doesn't stink. I try to wipe myself and get some on my thumbnail. The sink is filled to overflowing. I rinse my thumb and continue to wipe my butt, which has streaks of it. Suddenly Mary yells, "The Clinic," and gets up and runs so fast out of the bathroom that she doesn't even bother to open the door, she goes through the door, like she's a spirit or melts through it. I comment on that to Nancy, it is so amazing. Mary comes back very upset because she was right. She just missed her clinic appointment and it was so important. She's leaving for Mexico and wanted to know what to do if she got raped and they used knives to cut the inside of her vagina. I try to be helpful and suggest she can find some books on the subject at Paralandra's. It wouldn't be the same, but maybe it would help. [BL] (209 words)

My mother is fixing a huge special breakfast: eggs, pancakes, bacon, sweet rolls. I look forward to it and pick up the sweet rolls and put them in a pan on the burner to cook through. My mother speaks to me and I can't understand her for several tries. Finally I smile and say, "OK, I'll get it, I should not have put the rolls on so soon." I try to pick them up and they come apart. It's a mess. I am aware that I'm handling this situation differently than I usually do. I am more open and willing to admit a mistake and willing to try and fix it, rather than get all stubborn in my anger and shut down or snap back. [BL] (125 words)

I am at a school dance with my younger sister Lydia, pretending I am her age of 13. A young man (like Nate or Larry of high school) is drawn to me and I play coquettish 13 years old. It's time to leave, and as I go down the stairs, I start to look and act a bit older (16 years or so) and he is very enticed. I wear a sweater combo like in the 1950's. He follows. I run, laughing to my car and tell Lydia to hurry. We get in and he comes to the driver's side and wants to talk. I roll the window (wet from rain) down a quarter of the way. The window is a barrier for closeness and he asks me to open it more. I slowly, flirtatiously do so until it is full open. He wants to kiss me and I want it too, but hold off because of my tender age. I tell him I'm going to Judy's house to meet friends. He could go there too. We drive away, and I go to Judy's house, without Lydia now. I greet some girlfriends and soon he comes in and asks me to dance. I agree and we begin a slow dance. He bends down to kiss me and I turn shyly away. "I'm too young yet." "All right," he says, "but don't let anyone else kiss you. Let me be the first." I promise and we dance more closely, hugging; we know we are made for each other. [BL] (257 words)

I am on the Star Trek Enterprise. I have been transported accidentally from this time period and have become psychic. I am in an elevator with Capt. Picard. Some drippy substance that is painful and corrosive lands on him. I rush him to my apartment and put him in the bathtub. He pulls me in, laughing, and I wash him off. And as I do this, he turns so he's facing me. He's on top of me and I feel his hard dick and at first he can't seem to get it in and I reach down and help him. Between us, we get him in and it feels marvelous. We joyfully make love. [BL] (114 words)

I am going to a bookstore and start walking, hoping to catch the bus. It's two minutes until the bus is expected. I'm on 14th street and am headed for 10th. The walking is hard going and painful. I get there. It's a conveyer belt of canned goods. A woman helps check them out. They are packaged up in plastic crates with an identifying tag so you know what's yours and where one stops and the other starts. Now I'm watching couples at a "butt watching" fair or gathering. Three couples, all dark, straight hair, dark complexion (Italian) are together. One woman is very upset and a man is trying to help her. He holds her quarters for her without taking any. She doesn't trust he has done so sand asks another woman to check for her. The other woman counts the eight quarters and the one silver dollar and hands them to me to hold for her. It's confirmed and she hugs the man. They are very close, cuddling. His arms are around her as she leans her back into his chest, then feet out in front of them, intertwined. The other woman says, "You can't do that if your not going to get married." This makes them think because they were intending to be just very good friends until she was cured and then she would go on and marry someone else. She looks over and sees the man's best friend and decides to marry him. This causes the man to turn and look long and searching into her eyes. He now wants to marry her. I think she wants it too and was using a ploy to get his attention. [BL] (283 words)

Katrina tells me to flap my wings and fly up high. I try, but it is hard. I go through the layers of wood in the frame of the house and he is on the opposite side, nearly getting me (see drawing in dream book).

I am going up a mountainside. I am scooping up a fine dust into a container. I think the container is full, but then I notice several big rocks in it and empty the rocks onto the ground. Now there is lots more room in the container and I scoop up more fine dust. I fill the container. Now I am at the top of the mountain, which is shaped like female genitals. The top of the mountain is indented like the vulva. It's like a Phillips screw head with a "crossroads" in the top. On the left side, the gold has all been panned out, long ago.

I did research on a board game and played it myself to understand it. It involves movie stars. I now am sharing the game with a group of friends: Hillary of Merton Circle, Bob M of Counseling and two other women. I look up to the ceiling and see four large glass or ceramic things we'd somehow secured up there. One is a large cat ceramic (like the one on my fireplace). Another is a dog one, like a cookie jar. One is a huge red glass bowl with ornate embossed patterns on it, very Victorian and beautiful. I notice it's crooked and may fall. I am concerned because we are seated right under it. In the game, there is a MaMa card and a Doctor card. There are four categories to choose from. One is a picture of a young girl (7-8 years old) fleeing from a woman, perhaps in Indian (eastern) dress or early 1900's dress. The theme is the girl was hurt very badly by her mother. I don't remember the other three categories. I see Ginger Rogers seated near the board. She is one of the women in the group, and I say, "You were my mother in a movie. I'm not surprised you don't remember, I had forgotten too." Now I'm having trouble remembering how to play the game and it is getting boring. I fold it up like an accordion credit card holder, wondering why I thought it was such a good game. [BL] (249 words)

I and two men are in a large house. We've been up all night writing. Taking turns writing in a computer in a small room that looks out over the ocean. I am distracted from writing when I glance out the window and see how very blue the water is and I think I see a seal. But it is two black dogs sitting in a shrub tree. Then I see penguins and gulls all over. I realize it is the rocky surf and not yet the ocean I am looking at. The ocean is much further out. It is low tide. I then realize I'll never get my writing done if I spend all my time gazing at my ocean. The one man and I are a team helping each other as we write and co-writing the thing. There is a good mutual admiration society going on. [BL] (148 words)

I am living at home with my parents in M City. I have three cars and someone delivers some oil. It squirts out of the hose and leaks all over as it fills a tank outside the house. I feel better having it full now. I get in my red car with a floor stick shift and start to drive. I turn the corner to the left and squeal out, liking the good way the car is running. I feel pleased that I have three running cars now and Howard doesn't have as much. I feel a bit sorry for him, and as I drive I realize he wants to talk to me and wonder what it's about. I am feeling a bit superior about being better off than Howard. Then I remember I still live with my parents and feel embarrassed because I should at this age be out on my own. Even though I need someone to live in and help me, I could do that with a roommate. That would be more adult than relying on my parents. [BL] (181 words)

I look up and the baby girl has gone off to talk to some people. I feel tired, but it is my duty to teach her the more disciplined way of not barging in other people's conversations. I go get her and bring her back. She is not happy about that. Soon I see that she has gone again and I get up and retrieve her again. I feel tired, but know this is the only way to assist her to get along better with others. Later, we are in our apartment. I am in a dining area and a big living room adjoins it. There is also a bedroom space where my bed is and another open space where her bed is. I walk into the bedroom area and see it's really a barn. There is a layer of hay on the floor and the whole end wall is missing and open to the outdoors. I am surprised and repeat to myself, "I live in a barn." I go back to the dining area and then feel danger. I know the elevator is going to crash through the ceiling. At first I think it is the girl that lives above us dancing too much or something. I look up and see a square and then it opens up and an open elevator crashes through with two people on it, one a boy and the other a huge fat woman. It smashes the couch and I am relieved to know I or the little girl wasn't sitting there or we'd have been smashed. [BL] (263 words)

I am in the front row of a huge audience in a big gym for a rock concert. I am in a manual wheelchair. There are some other disabled people in the audience but mostly they are ab's. There is a large empty floor space between the first row of audience and the stage. On the stage is a group of men playing rock music. One is particularly attractive. He says he will kiss one of the disabled people. I go up quickly to the edge of the stage and he comes down on the floor and picks me up in a lavish body dancing dip posture and exaggerates a kiss. I play along dramatically. As we finally kiss, I realize he is wearing a wooden mask with a small hole for the mouth and he "tongues" me through the hole. He whispers his apology and says that later we will really kiss. I feel frustrated, but try my best to kiss real good. Our tongues touch. I go back to my seat. Now the group resets up their stage setting on the floor right in front of me. They have a play they will do and create fold-out sets and costumes in a wardrobe, within a foot of where I sit. I am excited I will get to see things so close. He asks how many disabled there are in the audience. They yell or raise their hands. There are a few. I change to my power wheelchair to dance with him. [BL] (253 words)

The women come in and I give them the keys to their complementary resting rooms and try to connect with the man. He is allusive. I suggest I show him his room; he can use mine. I take him to the elevator. He turns and walks away. I turn and push number 4 and the elevator opens. It is tiny and crowded with a wheelbarrow with a small girl in it and a metal container that smells very metallic. I get in, resigned, and go up to my room. [BL] (137 words)

Aunt Naomi says, "Basketball," meaning the teen boys must have been playing basketball in my room. I say, "How am I going to get this back the way it was?" She says, "We'll get Lionel to help us." I start to go downstairs but she says, "No, let's do it the easy way, and put the phone on hold and dial 86, the extension." She does so and we wait. I see Lionel walk past the door across the hall and don't call out to him. We wait some more. Naomi calls again, number 85. She goes out. I start to move the bed myself. It was pretty easy. I almost get it in the right position but now I wait some more. [BL] (152 words)

Someone exchanges the little glass pitcher or creamer with another one that matches the bowl already there. It's like my mother's cranberry sauce bowl, glass rounded ribs. I say, "Very nice, but probably more expensive and too big to be in scale." I go on. I remember to look for a video camera case to fit my video camera and ask a man. He is condescending and looks for an ordinary case. I am annoyed. Can't he see? I say, "If you would just look at MY camera, you would see it is a more complex and advanced camera."

I pull off layer after layer of cardboard some with writing on it from the baby's mother, I finally find the baby in a plastic molded container like she was a doll.

I hesitantly agree. I want her to stop, but I feel squeamish about doing it myself. So they shot her with a gun and she falls. Now we have to get rid of the body, but I notice she's not dead yet. She's still breathing. One of my friends puts her on my bed while she goes looking for something to finish her off with. I feel real dread at being so close to her. She stares out vacantly, breathing. I feel sick, being so near her. I start to feel remorse. First she felt ill anyway, and now we've added the pain of a bullet and blood. Someone suggests we give her an overdose of pain killers so she'll be free of the pain and finally die. I agree and then I feel bad and decide it's best to turn ourselves in with her so she can get help. It was wrong to try to kill her. I agree to take the full blame and I say I will tell the authorities that I killed her and shot the gun myself. That way my friends won't get in trouble for trying to help me.

Unbeknownst to me, the man wants to marry me and is setting up this ceremony to camouflage the wedding ceremony. So Paulina and start walking and soon find ourselves out in a desert area like near M City. No one else is around and the road seems unmarked. We wonder if we are in the right place. I look back and see the dirt road and some people coming out way far back. So I know we are just ahead of everyone else. We continue on. Then we see some wooden houses, white man buildings, and realize that in order to make us comfortable, they have built this little village. We look at each building and admire it. They are cute. Now the Native American man comes to me and suggests I sit with the children during the ceremony rather than in the bleachers with the audience. I agree. He then shows me an ordinary smoking pipe and says if this is handed to me, I must hold it in my cupped hands just as he shows me, or I will offend the gods. I agree and watch carefully. I ask how I should return it after I have taken a smoke. He says, "Turn it this way (full circle, clockwise) and hand the pipe stem first." I listen carefully and nod. The ceremony begins.

I am on stage, as a sort of stage manager, in C City. A little black girl is going to do ballet and tap dancing. She does the ballet and the audience loves it, although it is a redneck audience and usually doesn't care for this sort of thing. I think some rough man kind of forced them to be there, because he wanted the girl to have an audience. Just before the show, I had looked through the curtains to see only a few people seated up front and to the left side. There is a short intermission for the girl to change into her tap shoes. The time gets longer and the audience gets restless. I think, "I'd better do some Evangeline if this keeps up." She comes back, but she doesn't want to dance now. She says her tummy is upset and she had to go to the bathroom and maybe she'll dance, maybe she won't. I say, "Then I need to know. Take one minute to decide. Either way it's OK. If you dance, fine, if you don't, fine, I will just do my Evangeline character. But I need to know now!" She agrees to dance. I go out front of the curtain and chat with the audience about how the town hasn't changed much since I was there years ago. [BL] (225 words)

I realize this and pass my food on to the others so I won't get fat. I hope they don't notice. I watch them carefully, feeling fear because I know at some point I shall have to make a stand and will probably be killed. At one point I am somehow flying up the outside wall and peeking inside a window where two aliens are going to make love. As they do, I overhear one saying in horror, "You have a white cross mark on your hand." This means that their blood will kill him if he contacts it. I then know how I can save myself. Now I am back at the table and I try to set up a fight between aliens so their bad blood will kill themselves off. I hope I'm not killed in the process. [BL] (173 words)

Dovre is choosing some miniature furniture from my collection. She has to return home and I am going to drive her to the airport in the next small town, but she says she prefers to go farther to the Hartford airport because she wants to hang out in the big city for a while. I am annoyed. I don't want to take that kind of time and energy. Then I feel guilty because a good mother would do this happily for her child. I am being selfish. [BL] (87 words)

I am driving a motorcycle "car" with two seats. It's sort of a race. I must stop for gas very often, like every ten feet or so, and I keep forgetting to turn the engine back on. Then I spin my wheels, wasting the gas. A dark-haired young woman in an emerald green outfit is racing me. She is behind me and never smiles. She'd ask me when I stop for gas and then I'd pass her on the road. The road is curvy like a curved staircase. A young man (maybe Dwight) is in the passenger seat. I think I wear the old-fashioned motorcycle hat with flaps over the ears, made of leather. [BL] (114 words)

I am in some man's bed and I'm reading his sex book, looking at pictures of a step-by-step sexual encounter. I see him hugging the woman from behind and I see the vulva from the perspective of looking at from the outside, like a doctor would see or a lover. I feel sexual excitement with all these pictures.

I am in danger. There are aliens and we must run. A woman says, Synchronize your watches." I see mine is set now for 10 of 1:00. We take a deep breath and start walking briskly down the sidewalk. Now we must do what is called chaining. There are fringes of styrofoam-like curls like packing material on our ankles and when we come to a doorway or checking area, we must give up one chain. The door was coming frequently (like taxing booths), the paths are branching out and soon we will lose all our chains and then God knows what will happen to us. I think I carry a child or two in my arms. We are like fleeing Jews. [BL] (121 words)

There is a bad guy that can emanate some horrible, painful sound or radiation that keeps everyone his prisoner. Just at the moment he turns it on, I as a superman kind of being disintegrate and disperse my molecules as I fly up and away. He's upset I got away. But now I must go back and fight him in order to save my family, now frozen in his power. I go, via instructions from some feminine voice, to a platform up in the clouds and there are some remote control-like game boards in a basket. I pick up one. The voice says, "This one can be adapted well." I look at it closer. It is a chess game, electronic. I say "Ah, the good old chess game," satisfied it can be modified to fight this powerful man and save my family. I turn it over and look at the back side of it and see the tiny shapes of the black "men" or pieces. I want to review the rules of how they are allowed to move. [BL] (178 words)

My mother has a heating pad and is placing it on me as I am laying down and I say, "No, it goes this way." She says, "No, it doesn't." I say, "Mom, do it my way because it's the way I want it." She resists and I feel angry. I insist. [BL] (52 words)

I am in a large room, sort of like a gym with furniture. Merle and I are exercising. I am standing and doing stretches. One leg up and then the other and stretching every part of me. It felt wonderful. I tease Merle and tickle him on his round tummy. Now we are moving furniture, a yellow couch. Ginny helps. I pin some yellow sheets of paper up on a side wall of a stage area that is not accessible to wheelchairs. I walk, so it's no problem for me. Someone takes them down and I say, "Hey, put them back! I put them there so people can write on them. I am expecting lots of school kids to come." He says, "But it seems there are better places for this." I say, "I looked. This is the best place." Then I look around again and realize that the main gym wall is accessible and all I would have to do is move the kid's pictures displayed there up here on the side stage wall and use that space. I go to the man and say, "You were right. There is a better place." I go down to do that. I see a huge map of the world on the wall, and later I see it's gone. Now the kids are arriving. I see someone has taken something of mine and I complain, but what shall I do about the pain? I look and I see two Alka Seltzer pills and a small pill. I tell Ginny that these are mine, for the pain. Ginny is busting two kid girls for having drugs. She is lecturing them. [BL] (277 words)

I am camping out with a couple of men and their boys. The other wife didn't come, so I sit alone while the men go out hiking or something. I sit rather bored on a log or something. I lay back and notice the sky. On the left side, it is twilight and an occasional star. On the right side, is a black sky filled with stars. I wonder why that is and look back and forth at the differences. I then see on the right side that part of the difference is there are lots of cloud-like things which is the Milky Way. Now the men come back with the boys and are cutting up a big meat loaf into strips and squares to eat. I say to one of the men that I wish his wife Irene were here so I'd have someone to talk to. Then I look up in the sky again and see ducks, lots of them flying by, big adult ducks and lots of baby ducks. One duck attacks another and bites it. I realize they are very hungry. I want to feed the baby ones and get some bread and crumble it up. Some adult ducks land and eat and then a baby duck comes down and sticks to a wall. I go over to see it and notice it is a piece of cardboard folded in half and I open it to see a purple colored jewel and realize these ducks aren't born yet. This is their embryo in this jewel-like thing and they are still growing and forming. I regret having called them down and try to send them back on their way, hoping I haven't caused them any harm.

I am in a wheelchair and decide to go out the front door of this hotel. I open the door and a car is parked right by the door. I ask someone to help me and I get out of my chair and get into the passenger side of the car. The other person then takes the wheels off the chair and folds it and puts it in the car with me. I thank them, shut the door and now transfer over to the driver's side of the car and open that door. I pull out a tool and reach for the parts of the chair to reassemble it. I was using the car as a transition to get to the driveway so I can continue on. I realize I am making a lot of work for myself. There must be an easier way. I start to sew the button on a sweater, which is putting the wheels back on the chair, sort of. One side of the sweater is pink and the other side is blue (like reversible). The button is big, white and thick. This is going to take lots of time and energy. [BL] (196 words)

I keep wondering what I can make to sell at the Saturday Market, that would make money. Then I wonder why I want to do that. Do I enjoy hanging out all day selling stuff? I don't. A man is snide and says he sells anything the public will buy, a child or sexual abuse stuff? He doesn't care, as long as it sells. I turn my back on him in contempt. He or somebody is sweeping up snow or hail from the floor. [BL] (84 words)

I am doing an absurd skit with Justin. We run about the garden looking at trees and making jokes. He says we must only look for the A tree and the B tree. I run around in an English way with an English accent and say, "Oh where could the 'A' tree be? Oh, here it is." He follows me around closely, trying to be the tree. I ignore him. "Oh, where is the 'B' tree? Here? No, here? No, ooh here it is, no, that's a bee, an insect, not a tree. Then here? Now here's an interesting tree! Look over there, it has a very interesting root structure, if we only could see it. We lay down on the ground and he picks up the bottom of the raised root structure (like mangrove trees) and I snicker and say, "Oh I must be wrong," but if it were the right tree, then it would be
